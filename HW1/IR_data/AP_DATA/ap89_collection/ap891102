   Tugboats successfully dragged a 475-foot
Yugoslavian freighter from a sandy shoal off the Florida Keys late
Thursday after the ship's fuel oil was pumped off to a barge to
lighten the vessel, the Coast Guard said.
   The Mavro Vetranic, which ran aground on the shoal containing
fragile coral last Monday, was refloated at 9:04 p.m. EST ``with
the assistance of tugs _ we don't know how many,'' said Coast Guard
spokesman Steve Sapp.
   ``They're moving it to safe anchorage in deeper water. What
they're going to do is perform a survey inside the ship to see how
much damage was done,'' Sapp said.
   ``There was no leaking or pollution of any kind'' from the
freighter, he added.
   Sapp said the freighter was pulled free shortly after crews
completed the two-day operation to unload the ship's fuel as the
tide was coming in.
   The hull was not damaged when the ship ran aground early Monday
in the Dry Tortugas about 60 miles west of Key West, but state
officials estimate the ship caused tens of millions of dollars
damage by carving a 500-foot swath through coral patches.
   The state expected to file suit for reef damage Friday in Monroe
Circuit Court.
   Coast Guard Capt. Henry D. Jacoby flew to Key West on Thursday
to convene a fact-finding board of inquiry to determine the cause
of the grounding.

   Guerrillas on Thursday withdrew
from cease-fire talks with the rightist government to protest the
bombing of a union hall that killed 10 people.
   Thousands of people, many chanting for the death of the leader
of President Alfredo Cristiani's governing party, marched through
downtown in a funeral procession for six of the 10 victims of the
attack.
   ``Because the color of blood is never forgotten, our slain
companions will be avenged!'' shouted the unionists and students
carrying wreaths and banners denouncing Cristiani's government.
   ``Death to D'Aubuisson!'' shouted the marchers, referring to
Roberto D'Aubuisson, founder and honorary president of Cristiani's
Republican Nationalist Alliance. Human rights advocates consider
D'Aubuisson the mastermind of rightist death squads that in the
early 1980s killed thousands of suspected leftists.
   Leftist groups blame the administration and the military for the
bombing Tuesday. Military spokesmen have rejected the leftists'
accusation and promised to investigate and punish those
responsible. No one claimed responsibility.
   Soldiers and police stayed well away during most of the march.
The only incident occurred when a soldier tossed a tear-gas grenade
at the rear of a march, leaving a few dozen demonstrators crying
and coughing.
   In a radio broadcast, the Farabundo Marti National Liberation
Front guerrillas said they will not take part in the next round of
negotiations until the government offers better guarantees for the
survival of leftist organizations.
   Representatives of the two sides in the decade-old civil war
were scheduled to hold their third meeting this year on Nov. 20-21
in Caracas, Venezuela.
   Earlier meetings in Mexico City and San Jose, Costa Rica, had
deadlocked, but the two sides had agreed to continue meeting
monthly until a cease-fire was negotiated.
   There was no immediate government reaction to the guerrilla
statement. Government offices were closed for the Day of the Dead
holiday, and an employee at the home of the government press
secretary said he was out of town.
   In the broadcast over private radio station YSU, the guerrillas
said they had information the bomb attack Tuesday that killed 10
people and wounded 29 was planned and carried out by the military
in retaliation for a guerrilla attack Monday on the Defense
Ministry.
   The statement said Gen. Rene Ponce, military chief of staff,
approved attacks ``which were known and authorized by President
Cristiani and were executed by Col. (Francisco) Elena Fuentes,
commander of the shady 1st Infantry Brigade squadron.''
   The guerrillas gave no details to back up their assertion.
   The rebels said they were withdrawing from the talks in order
not to legitimize the ``government's responsibility for the
massacre.''
   The downtown hall belonging to the National Federation of
Salvadoran Workers, known by its Spanish initials as Fenastras, was
partially destroyed by the blast.
   Another bomb earlier Tuesday injured four people at the office
of Madres, an organization of relatives of political prisoners.
   Two Americans were slightly injured in the blasts.
   On Wednesday, rebels fired two anti-tank weapons at the
headquarters of the 1st Brigade, killing one civilian and wounding
another.
   More than 70,000 people, mostly civilians, have been slain in
the civil war.
   President Bush on Thursday condemned recent violence ``from
extremists from both the left and the right'' but said Cristiani's
government ``continues in the democratic path'' of former
Salvadoran president Jose Napolean Duarte.
   Bush spoke at a ceremony honoring Duarte at Walter Reed Medical
Center in Washington, where the former Salvadoran leader is
hospitalized with terminal cancer.
   In March, voters elected Cristiani over the candidate of the
then-governing Christian Democratic Party. Cristiani replaced
Duarte, who by law could not run for re-election.

   A Roman Catholic American nun was reported
missing in Guatemala on Thursday, the State Department said
Thursday night.
   Spokesman Dave Denny said after a telephone conversation with
the U.S. Embassy in Guatemala City that the embassy did not have a
confirmed identity of the missing nun.
   Denny said he thus could not confirm a report that it was Sister
Diana Ortiz of the Ursuline order, as reported in Kentucky.
   The Louisville Courier-Journal in Friday editions quoted members
of the order as saying Ortiz disappeared from the Ursuline retreat
house at Antigua, about 15 miles west of Guatemala City, between 8
a.m. and 9 a.m. while praying alone in a courtyard. Her shawl was
found in the courtyard by her two colleagues who lived with her
there on a teaching assignment in the village of San Miguel Acatan.
   Ortiz had received at least seven threatening letters this year
warning her to leave the country and her colleagues fear she has
been kidnapped, Sister Mary Elizabeth Dallard of the Ursuline
convent in Maple Mount, Ky. told the newspaper.
   But no group has claimed responsibility for a kidnapping.
   Denny said the Guatemalan police had been given a missing person
report. Police do not act on such reports for 24 hours while
waiting to see if the missing person turns up, he said.
   A nun from the Antigua retreat house is to visit the embassy on
Friday to provide more information, Denny said.
   Ortiz, a native of Grants, N.M., had taught school in Owensboro
and Hawesville, Ky., before going to Guatemala two years ago.

   Only a few blocks separate the
Confederate banner flapping atop Alabama's Capitol from a new
memorial honoring 40 people who died fighting for civil rights.
   Cool water flows down the black slabs that form the back wall of
the monument, which will be dedicated Sunday as the nation's first
memorial to those killed in America's struggle for racial equality.
   In front of the monument's wall, a round granite table is etched
with a timeline of the civil rights era _ 1954-68 _ and the names
of those 40 who lost their lives during it. Water flowing out from
the center of the table, covers the words.
   A few of the names are recognizable: Martin Luther King Jr. and
Medgar Evers, for example, as well as James Chaney, Andrew Goodman
and Michael Schwerner, the three who were murdered during the
``Freedom Summer'' of 1964 and whose story was depicted in the film
``Mississippi Burning.''
   Others are not so well known. Who was Vernon Dahmer? Or Jimmie
Lee Jackson? While King's 1968 assassination sent a tidal wave of
emotion across the national landscape, their deaths caused barely a
ripple.
   The $700,000 monument was designed by Maya Lin, who created the
Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. It sits in front of
the Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights law firm founded in
1971 by attorney Morris Dees.
   The center's previous office burned down in 1983; two Ku Klux
Klansmen and a sympathizer were convicted for setting the fire. The
new facility, a glass-and-stone structure of modern design and
heavy security, rose from those ashes.
   Dees came up with the idea for a memorial after addressing an
NAACP meeting in 1987 and realizing its younger members were
unaware even of people like Evers, the head of the Mississippi
NAACP who was shot on June 12, 1963.
   ``It really struck me that these young people were active in a
black civil rights organization and didn't know who these people
were,'' said Dees.
   For Ellie Dahmer, one of 600 relatives of the dead who will
attend the dedication, the memorial is ``one of the most beautiful
things that's been done for the civil rights workers.'' Her
husband, Vernon, died of burns on Jan. 10, 1966, after Klansmen
firebombed their home in Hattiesburg, Miss.
   Dahmer, a prominent black businessman, had said he would pay the
poll taxes for poor blacks who otherwise could not vote. Three
Klansmen were convicted of murder in the bombing.
   Former Marion Police Chief T.O. Harris has a problem with one
activist being honored _ Jimmie Lee Jackson, who was shot during a
civil rights march that turned violent in Marion on Feb. 26, 1965.
   ``Jimmie Lee saw a trooper strike his mother, and he lunged for
the man without thinking,'' according to a publication put out by
the law center to tell the stories of the honored 40. ``A trooper
clubbed him across the face and slammed him into a cigarette
machine. As Jimmie Lee was forced against the machine, another
trooper ... shot him in the stomach.''
   Harris, who helped get Jackson to a hospital after the shooting,
remembered it differently in an interview last week. ``He hit a
trooper in the head with a bottle before he was shot. He brought it
on himself.''
   Montgomery is known as the Cradle of the Confederacy as well as
the birthplace of the civil rights movement.
   A visitor to the monument, standing on a hillside near Dexter
Avenue, downtown's main steet, can see the steeple of King's first
church a little more than a block away. Just two blocks away are
the First White House of the Confederacy and the Capitol, where
Jefferson Davis took the oath of office as the first president of
the Confederacy.
   Organizers have said up to 10,000 people could attend the
dedication, including Georgia's first black state lawmaker, Julian
Bond, and Rosa Parks, who instigated the Montgomery bus boycott of
1955-56 by refusing to give up her seat to a white man.
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young and Coretta
Scott King could not attend because of prior commitments, spokesmen
said, although about 50 King relatives will be on hand. Gov. Guy
Hunt, who has resisted attempts to take down the Rebel flag over
the Capitol, also cited a scheduling conflict.
   In recent years, litigation brought by the law center has helped
bankrupt the Ku Klux Klan in Alabama.
   David Wayne Holland of Lawrenceville, Ga., who recently resigned
as grand dragon of the Southern White Knights of the KKK, went to
federal court seeking a permit to stage a demonstration during the
dedication.
   However, U.S. District Judge Robert Varner ruled Thursday that
city officials' concerns over public safety were justified in
denying the Klan permission to protest. Varner cited Holland's
speeches and his involvement in a violent 1987 confrontation in
Forsyth County, Ga., as reasons to keep him away.

   Leland Holland survived his hostage ordeal and
now battles prostate cancer. Thomas Schaefer helps people cope with
stress. Bruce Laingen keeps a yellow ribbon on his flag to remember
other U.S. hostages.
   Kevin Hermening treasures walks in the free, fresh air of the
forest with the appreciation of one who was held for 444 days by an
Iranian mob 10 years ago.
   ``Whether we like it or not, we'll always be ex-hostages. It
drives me in everything I do,'' said Hermening, 30, an ex-Marine
and the youngest hostage.
   ``I feel I've been given a second chance,'' said Hermening, who
lives in suburban Milwaukee. ``You can either go into a shell and
have it eat at your insides, or you can grow. You have to get on
with life.''
   It was Sunday morning, Nov. 4, 1979, when an Iranian mob broke
international law and shamed a superpower by seizing the U.S.
Embassy. Fifty-two Americans were held until Jan. 20, 1981, the day
Ronald Reagan took over Jimmy Carter's foiled presidency.
   The militants demanded the return of their hated shah, who had
entered a U.S. hospital for cancer treatment 13 days before the
takeover. When that failed, they dangled their captors as pawns to
fuel their revolution. In the process, Iran became an outcast in
the world community.
   The hostages became metaphors of American humiliation and pain
but also were a unifying force. The joy of their release rekindled
patriotism and helped a nation heal the leftover wounds of Vietnam.
   Their ordeal is seared into the American psyche along with
images of a glowering ayatollah, eight soldiers who died in a
desert in hopes of freeing them, billboards saying ``Merci
Beaucoup'' to Canadians who helped six Americans escape and yellow
ribbons that fluttered the message the entire country was hostage.
   ``When we returned, that burden of having been held hostage
politically was lifted from the country's shoulders,'' said
Laingen, the embassy's charge d'affaires who now directs the
National Commission on Public Service, a private agency working to
attract quality people to the government.
   ``We were 52 Americans in distress. The whole country rallied
around. We saw a national catharsis,'' he said.
   Laingen, 68, sets out his American flag beribboned in yellow to
remember the eight American hostages held by Iranian-backed
radicals in Lebanon, one of whom has been held for over four years.
   ``I think most of us have put the hurt, the travail of our
experience behind us,'' Laingen said. ``The most telling reminder
is that terrorism has not gone away, hostage-taking has not gone
away.''
   The hostages endured mock executions, beatings, solitary
confinement and wormy food over 14 months.
   Holland, a retired Army colonel, says some scars still exist
from being imprisoned alone in a bug-infested dungeon.
   ``Heaven help a roach if I see one. I will get a shotgun to kill
a fly. I hate bugs,'' said Holland, 62, who was handcuffed,
blindfolded and smacked with a rifle butt during captivity.
   He got some measure of revenge by showing his backside to TV
cameras set up by his captors to track hostages when they went to
the bathroom.
   Holland, now living in the Washington, D.C., area, was told
three years ago he has prostate cancer.
   ``I can sit around and worry myself to death, or I can take
advantage of however much time I have left on earth. I don't intend
to be miserable because of what happened to me,'' Holland said.
   Explaining why he's not bitter toward his captors, he said, ``If
nothing else, I want to show I'm tougher than they are.''
   The hostage crisis boiled down to a quarrel between two
countries that still share a deep mutual distrust. It was resolved
when the United States pledged not to interfere in Iran's internal
affairs and the two countries established a framework for settling
billions of dollars in claims against each other.
   The United States still holds Iranian assets valued at billions
of dollars. Diplomatic relations are severed.
   The freed Americans were treated like prisoners of a political
war fought with nerves rather than bullets.
   ``None of us thinks of ourselves as heroes. We think of
ourselves as people who survived,'' said Barry Rosen, a former
press attache who is now assistant to the president at Brooklyn
College.
   Thomas Schaefer, a retired Air Force colonel, rationalized his
captivity as a learning experience. He opened an agency devoted to
helping people handle stress and adversity.
   ``I don't look at it as losing 444 days of my life. I gained
many things, such as finding out strengths I never knew I had until
I was presented with this challenge,'' said Schaefer, 60, now
living in Sun City West, Ariz.
   Some of the 52 hostages are still in the diplomatic service and
some have switched careers or retired. One, William Keough, died in
1985.
   Robert Blucher, an oil specialist who arrived in Iran one week
before the takeover, doesn't register to vote so he won't be
confined in a room if he's called to jury duty.
   ``I'm not prepared to do jury duty. I don't like to be in the
control of others,'' said Blucher, 63, of San Antonio.
   Joseph Subic, a former Army sergeant, works in enforcement for
the state Agriculture Department in southern Florida. He was the
only serviceman not decorated upon his release. Other hostages say
he cooperated with his captors by giving background information on
comrades, but he denies helping the enemy.
   ``I did the best I could. I have nothing to look back on and say
I'm sorry for. I sleep well at night. I have nothing to hide,''
said Subic, 33.
   ``Iran is over with.''

<HEAD>Study: Panic Attacks Strongly Linked with Suicide Attempts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors may be able to prevent suicides by
recognizing when people are in the grips of terrifying panic
attacks and helping them seek treatment, researchers report today.
   The research published in the New England Journal of Medicine
found that people who suffer recurring panic attacks are 18 times
more likely than other people to try to kill themselves.
   During panic attacks, people are gripped by sudden,
unpredictable waves of intense apprehension or fear. They may
suffer a variety of distressing symptoms, including difficulty
breathing, palpitations, chest pain, choking, dizziness, faintness,
trembling and hot and cold flashes.
   Victims often believe they are suffering heart attacks or dying.
When they go to emergency rooms, however, they are sometimes told
nothing is wrong with them.
   In an editorial accompanying the study, Dr. Peter Reich of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology called the findings ``quite
remarkable.'' He said they deserve widespread attention because
they ``may provide general physicians with new opportunities to
prevent suicide by recognizing and treating panic disorder.''
   An estimated 1.5 percent of Americans, or more than 3 million
people, have panic disorder, recurring bouts of intense fear that
strike for no apparent reason. Up to 9 million people have
occasional panic attacks.
   The study directed by Dr. Myrna M. Weissman found that 20
percent of people with panic disorder had attempted suicide, as had
12 percent of those with occasional panic attacks.
   The finding ``points to a potentially serious complication of a
common disorder that has been relatively neglected,'' commented Dr.
Kerrin White of McLean Hospital in suburban Boston.
   The researchers said that people plagued by panic attacks may
believe they are going crazy and turn to alcohol, become afraid to
leave their homes or grow depressed.
   They said their work should encourage emergency room doctors and
other physicians who often see people during panic attacks to offer
treatment for their disorder.
   ``We hope this alerts the non-psychiatric physician to the
potential mortality and morbidity of panic disorder,'' said
Weissman, a psychiatric epidemiologist at Columbia University. ``If
a patient comes into the cardiac clinic and has panic disorder, and
heart attack is ruled out, we would like the physician to realize
that the patient should be evaluated for panic disorder.''
   Just why people with panic attacks are unusually prone to
suicide is unclear. Some believe that depression may play a role,
although it does not entirely explain the increased risk.
   ``People who have panic attacks for many years become
demoralized,'' said Dr. Gerald L. Klerman of Cornell Medical
School, a co-author of the study. ``They stay at home and withdraw
socially and become depressed. We know that depressive feelings are
associated with suicide.''
   Panic attacks can be controlled with medical treatment and
behavioral therapy. However, Dr. Brian Doyle of Georgetown
University said that some people simply try to live with their
episodes of terror.
   ``Many patients with panic disorder are fine, upstanding people
who do not want to be considered flaky,'' he said. ``So they tend
to white knuckle through their panic attacks. Many times, they work
very hard to control the symptoms, but internally they are in a
great deal of distress.''
   The underlying cause of panic disorder is not known. However,
the problem runs in families, and experts believe genetic factors
may be involved.
   In the study, researchers surveyed a random sample of 18,011
people in St. Louis, Baltimore, Los Angeles, Durham, N.C., and New
Haven, Conn.
   In addition to the 18 times greater chance of a suicide attempt
by people who suffer recurring panic attacks, the study found that
such people also were twice as likely as those with other mental
disorders to attempt suicide. The risk grows as the number of panic
attacks increase. It is also higher for those who have their first
attacks at early ages.

   Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, in an
article published in The New York Times, pledged to hold ``free and
democratic'' elections next year and defended his decision to end a
cease-fire with the Contra rebels.
   Ortega also lashed out at President Bush for delivering a
``torrent of personal invective'' against the Central American
leader during a meeting of hemispheric leaders in Costa Rica last
week.
   ``He accused me of spoiling the `garden party' in Costa Rica,''
Ortega said in the op-ed piece published in Thursday's editions.
   ``Well, life in my country is no `garden party.' Eight years of
war financed and directed by the Reagan and Bush adminstrations
have seen to that.''
   Ortega defended his move to end the cease-fire, which he
announced last week in at the democracy celebration in San Jose,
Costa Rica, provoking outrage from Bush and other Latin American
leaders.
   The only way to peace in Nicaragua is to disband the
U.S.-supported rebels, Ortega wrote.
   ``We do not consider it an acceptable cease-fire when we cease
and the Contras fire,'' he said. ``For peace to be achieved, the
war itself must be stopped. There is no other way to end the war
than to start immediately the demobilization of the Contras.''
   ``A truly `big man' would have no difficulty making the right
choice,'' he wrote, in an apparent reference to Bush's
characterization of him as a ``little man.''
   Ortega said halting the cease-fire was necessary because the
rebels' aim through repeated violations was to subvert the
electoral process in Nicaragua, which has elections scheduled for
Feb. 25.
   ``During October, Contra units newly supplied and infiltrated
from Honduras closed more than 50 voter registration centers,
preventing thousands of citizens from registering to vote,'' Ortega
said. ``They targeted for assassination known Sandinista supporters
_ prominent community leaders, party activists and candidates for
municipal offices _ and slit their throats.''
   He cited other attacks, including one in which 19 reservists
were killed in an Oct. 21 ambush on their way to register to vote.
   ``Why the upswing in Contra violence? The success of our
electoral process has made them desperate. They fear that free
elections, duly recognized by the international community, will end
their flickering hopes of continuing the way,'' Ortega said.
   He also made a ``solemn pledge'' that his country would
``celebrate free, fair and democratic elections.''

   A nation that nervously watched the California
earthquake on television and then sent more than $7 million in aid
received a scare and a shaking from an equally powerful tremor
today.
   No casualties or major damage were reported in today's quake,
which measured an estimated 7.1 on the Richter scale and whose
impact was blunted by its epicenter's distance from Japan's Pacific
coast _ about 80 miles.
   Nevertheless, 6,165 people from six coastal towns and villages
were evacuated to town halls and school gymnasiums for fear of
tsunami, or waves generated by the quake, said Toshihara Kon, a
fire department official in Iwate prefecture, about 300 miles
northeast of Tokyo.
   The evacuation order was lifted 3{ hours after the quake hit at
3:26 a.m., Kon said. Shortly after that, all tsunami warnings were
lifted, the Central Meteorological Agency reported.
   As felt in northern Honshu, Japan's main island, the quake was
strong enough to shake buildings and topple unstable objects.
   Waves of up to two feet were reported in some areas, and about
400 boats, mostly fishing craft, put out to sea from Hachinohe to
avoid being caught in the harbor by tsunami. They later returned.
   Kon said a small landslide briefly blocked traffic on a local
road, but fallen dirt and rocks were cleared and traffic soon
returned to normal.
   Officials briefly closed the main expressway through the
affected region for inspection and overnight trains were stopped so
rails could be inspected.
   Japan's meteorological agency estimated the quake's magnitude at
7.1 on the Richter scale, nearly the same as that of the quake that
devastated much of the San Francisco Bay area on Oct. 17.
   The U.S. Geological Survey in Colorado estimated the Japanese
quake's magnitude at 7.3. Don Finley, a spokesman for the survey,
said it was the strongest in the region since a 7.7 quake on March
9, 1931.
   Toshio Akiyama, head of the Japanese agency's earthquake and
tsunami observation division, said that although distance weakened
the effect of today's quake, authorities were concerned because a
series of quakes have occurred in the area in recent months.
   On Sunday, a quake registering 6.5 and centered about 95 miles
off the coast hit the area without causing casualties or damage.
   Like California, Japan sits atop a major fault and is frequently
shaken by earthquakes. Although few cause casualties, fears of a
major temblor prompt regular national disaster-prevention drills
and newer buildings are designed to withstand quakes of up to 8 on
the Richter scale.
   Many Japanese had immediate word of the San Francisco quake as
they tuned in for a satellite telecast of the World Series.
   The Foreign Ministry said it knew of at least $7.2 million in
government and private contributions from Japan for San Francisco
quake victims.
   After that quake, Japanese experts rushed to the area, hoping to
learn why some buildings collapsed and others stood.
   Akiyama said Japan had a second quake today at 4:57 a.m. in
Tottori prefecture, about 300 miles southwest of Tokyo. He said
there were no casualties or damage reported from that 5.7-magnitude
quake, and today's two temblors were not related.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. A quake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage in
populated areas, and a quake of 7 is capable of widespread, heavy
damage.

   The Contra guerrillas fighting the Sandinista
government in Nicaragua have said it again and again: they don't
recognize the Central American peace accords and they won't accept
demobilization.
   That stubborn stand now has become a stumbling block to peace in
the region and to democratic elections in Nicaragua, leading to
President Daniel Ortega's announcement Wednesday that he was
suspending a 19-month truce and resuming the war.
   ``The problem here is not the cease-fire; the problem here is
the demobilization,'' said Ortega.
   He said he was ending the unilateral cease-fire, which began in
March 1988, because of increasing attacks by the Contras in
defiance of agreements signed by five Central American presidents
in Tela, Honduras on Aug. 7.
   The presidents called for voluntary demobilization, repatriation
or resettlement of Contra fighters, most of them based at camps in
Honduras. In exchange, Ortega agreed to democratize the electoral
process and hold elections on Feb. 25 with international observers.
   Battle-hardened Contra troop commanders who had taken over
leadership of the movement quickly said the peace process would not
work without their participation and vowed to move back into
Nicaragua with their men.
   ``We will say thank you and good-bye to Honduras,'' said
Commander `Dima,' a member of the Contra general staff, in an
interview at one of the camps on Aug. 25.
   U.S. officials said they would prefer that the Contras remain in
Honduras to guarantee the fairness of the Feb. 25 vote, and said
they feared the small groups of Contras would be wiped out by the
vastly larger Sandinista army.
   But the angry commanders, feeling betrayed both by the United
States and by other nations in the region, weren't listening.
   They also expressed contempt for Contra ``office soldiers'' who
spent the long years of war in Miami or Washington instead of the
jungle. They expressed bitterness about U.S. support, which one
compared to a balky cigarette lighter that ``works when it wants
to.''
   But they also felt a sense of freedom from restraints imposed by
U.S. policy as well as the taint of being U.S. mercenaries.
   Contra army commander Israel Galeano, in a speech at the
Contras' main camp at Yamales in Honduras, outlined a classic
guerrilla strategy for the future.
   ``If we fight for the people we have to gain their support,'' he
said. ``We are the peasants of Nicaragua.''
   He said that neither the Sandinistas nor the rest of the world
had ever acknowledged that the Contras were real people, poor
people, with real grievances against the Sandinista government.
   The bulk of the Contra army was in fact made up of sharecroppers
and small farmers who resented Sandinista land reform and attempts
to collectivize agriculture or force farmers to sell to the state
at fixed prices.
   ``We know we have made mistakes,'' said Defense Minister
Humberto Ortega, Daniel Ortega's brother, during a September
interview in Mexico City. Ortega said he thought Contras
infiltrating from Honduras would try to move into
Sandinista-controlled zones.
   ``We'll attack them so that we understand each other,'' he said.
   When the Aug. 7 agreements were announced, there were about
12,000 Contra fighters in Honduras, many of them accompanied by
their families.
   Some were already looking for ways to fade out of the war _
moving to Canada, finding work in Honduras or simply returning
quietly to their homes in Nicaragua.
   The numbers of those actually returning to Nicaragua as members
of fighting units is unclear.
   Enrique Bermudez, the only ``outside'' Contra commander who
retained respect among the fighters, said Wednesday that 6,000 had
returned. Daniel Ortega said 1,100 had returned in the last three
weeks; U.S. sources put total Contra forces in Nicaragua at 4,000.
   The United States has been providing non-lethal aid to the
Contras since military aid was suspended in February 1988. The
so-called ``humanitarian'' aid includes boots, tents and uniforms
that Contras can use in Nicaragua.
   But no weapons or ammunition were received, and U.S. sources in
Washington said they refused pleas to provide food in smaller
packages that would be easier to pack into the jungle.
   Nevertheless, the Contras said they would fight on, seizing
weapons and ammunition where they could. ``We started with .22s and
shotguns,'' said Dima.
   That fierce determination, foolish or not, finally led
Nicaragua's Sandinistas to the realization that the Dec. 5 deadline
for demobilization would not be met.
   The Sandinistas vowed to proceed with elections no matter what
the Contras did, but added that renewed U.S. military aid might be
cause for cancellation.
   Both Sandinistas and Contras on Wednesday announced escalating
clashes in the jungles and mountains of northern and eastern
Nicaragua, where the Contra troops were fighting for survival.
   As the fighting flared, Bermudez said in a telephone interview
that the Contras had not received ``even a single cartridge'' from
the United States, and admitted that prospects for renewed military
aid were grim.
   ``Faced with this reality, we can't do anything except save our
own lives and defend ourselves as best we can,'' he said.

   A hunter Wednesday found the nude, strangled body of a
4-year-old Oregon boy missing since Sunday, and rescuers elsewhere
in the state ended their search for a 9-year-old boy and his pony
after 10 fruitless days.
   In St. Joseph, Minn., meanwhile, the parents of 11-year-old
Jacob Wetterling, who was abducted 11 days ago by a masked gunman,
said they planned a nationwide mailing of fliers with their son's
photo and description. The search for Jacob continued.
   A hunter in Clark County, Wash., found the body of Lee Joseph
Iseli, 4, of Portland around 8:30 a.m. in bushes along a road near
Vancouver Lake, just across the Columbia River from Portland,
authorities said.
   The boy was strangled and his body was nude when found, said
Clark County Coroner Arch Hamilton. He declined to provide further
details about its condition.
   Portland police picked up copies of Lee's fingerprints from his
father for use in helping to identify the body.
   There had been growing fear a kidnapper might have taken the
boy, who disappeared Sunday afternoon from a playground where he'd
gone with his 9-year-old brother. Authorities prepared a drawing of
a man seen at the playground around that time.
   Dogs tracked the boy's scent from the playground to a street
curb, indicating the child might have gotten into a car.
   In central Oregon, searchers broke camp, ending the search of
snowy woods along the Little Deschutes River for Nathan Madsen, 9,
of Veneta, who disappeared with his pony Oct. 22 during a family
cattle roundup.
   Rescue units ran out of places to look for Nathan, said Klamath
County Sheriff Carl Burkhart.
   Burkhart said in a statement that there had been numerous
unsubstantiated rumors about the boy and his horse, a sorrel named
Tony, but authorities had no leads on where they were.
   At the height of the search last week, 350 people tramped over
an area nearly 30 miles square. The number of searchers dropped to
52 Monday after officials urged volunteers to return to their homes
and jobs.
   The investigation into Nathan's disappearance will continue,
Burkhart said.
   In St. Joseph in central Minnesota, Jerry and Patty Wetterling
held a news conference outside their home to announce the mailings
containing a description and photograph of their son.
   The first batch, about 30,000 fliers, is to go out Thursday, and
organizers hope to send millions in the next few weeks, said Vern
Iverson, a friend of the Wetterlings. They are being sent to fire
and police stations, military bases, hospitals, city governments
and social agencies, and to such national groups as the American
Medical Association, in hopes the groups will insert the fliers in
their own mailings.
   In an appearance Wednesday on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America,''
Stearns County Sheriff Charlie Grafft said authorities have
received ``hundreds and hundreds'' of calls since Jacob's abduction
on a rural road near his home Oct. 22. Grafft said the number of
tips and offers of help was ``mind-boggling.''
   Mrs. Wetterling said on the program that she wants everyone's
attention focused on Jacob to give him strength and to make his
face familiar so that his abductor has no option other than
returning him.
   She said she hasn't lost hope Jacob will be found.
   ``I just keep myself going by playing a tape in my head, `He's
OK, he's coming home soon, this is really wrong and he will be home
soon,''' she said.

   The House's two top party leaders asked
President Bush to back a pay raise for high-ranking government
officials, but the meeting did not produce an immediate
presidential endorsement, The Washington Post reported Friday.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., and Minority Leader
Robert Michel, R-Ill., told the president that without his support,
a pay raise for federal judges, members of Congress and senior
executive branch employees is dead, the newspaper reported.
   An unidentified White House official told the newspaper that the
president has not ruled out the possibility of a pay raise, but as
part of the package he wants Congress to adopt tighter ethics
restrictions.
   The Post said that Foley and Michel both back a pay raise
proposal that would phase in a 35 percent salary boost.
   A public uproar caused Congress to kill a pay proposal last year
that would have raised salaries by 51 percent.

   Retired educator Louis Saavedra won a
lopsided victory Wednesday over City Councilor Pat Baca in the
runoff election for mayor of Albuquerque, pulling down more than 60
percent of the vote.
   With all 152 precincts reporting, unofficial returns showed
Saavedra with 39,245 to Baca's 25,621. The margin was 60.8 percent
for Saavedra and 39.1 percent for Baca, also a retired educator.
   Saavedra, 56, the former president of Albuquerque
Technical-Vocational Institute, credited his emphasis on ``a
positive campaign.''
   ``I tried to focus on what I felt were the issues. People
believed that part and totally rejected the negative campaign of my
opponent,'' Saavedra said in an interview at City Hall as returns
came in.
   Saavedra takes office Dec. 1, succeeding outgoing Mayor Ken
Schultz, one of the seven also-rans in the Oct. 3 city election.
Schultz had sought to become the first Albuquerque mayor to win
re-election.
   The mayoral runoff had evolved into a controversy-filled
campaign that centered more on the candidates' backgrounds than on
city issues.
   Saavedra's campaign was plagued by the revelation that he
secretly received a paid-up $250,000 life insurance policy from the
T-VI board of directors. Saavedra resigned from the school last
summer to run for mayor.
   Baca, 62, had to battle criticism surrounding his council voting
record. Critics accused him of voting in favor of proposals that
eventually benefited him, his business interests or those of his
family.
   Saavedra gathered the largest vote in the October election but,
like Baca, failed to receive the 40 percent needed to win outright.

<HEAD>Navy Has Bad String of Accidents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The recent string of accidents aboard Navy
vessels may just be due to bad luck, rather than a lack of training
or poor equipment, congressional military experts say.
   But one civilian specialist who's studied hazards aboard
aircraft carriers warns that budget cuts in Navy training could
lead to more accidents.
   ``Congress is always trying to cut training budgets. But if a
pilot can't practice flying, those on the deck don't get trained
either. ... It's a prescription for an accident,'' said Karlene
Roberts, an industrial psychologist participating in a five-year
study of Nimitz-class aircraft carriers and hazardous industrial
systems.
   Overall, Ms. Roberts said, the Navy's safety record ``is
excellent.''
   From Sunday's jet crash aboard the aircraft carrier USS
Lexington that claimed five lives to Wednesday's fire aboard the
oiler USS Monongahela, the week has brought a series of accidents
that has left Navy brass shaking their heads.
   ``Operating at sea is an arduous life, and the lesson is that
even at peace time there are dangers,'' said Rear Adm. Brent Baker,
the head of the Navy's information division.
   ``That's no consolation to the families who have lost sons or
daughters. But those who have been around the Navy a long time
realize that's why we train so hard and emphasize safety. ... You
can't prepare for war at the pier,'' said Baker.
   The admiral called the string of accidents ``frustrating. It's a
real streak of bad luck.''
   Sen. John Warner of Virginia, the ranking Republican on the
Senate Armed Services Committee who served as undersecretary and
secretary of the Navy for five years, called the incidents ``an
extraordinary grouping of unrelated accidents.''
   ``Unquestionably we have the finest Navy in the world. We have
the best equipment, the best training that money can buy,'' Warner
told reporters.
   Warner called charges that Navy personnel were too young for
their duties ``nonsense.'' The senator said that when he served in
the Navy during World War II, many of the personnel were 17 years
old and some could not read or write.
   Ms. Roberts, a professor of business at the University of
California at Berkeley, said that while the sailors are young _
averaging usually 20 years of age _ they are trained for specific
jobs through ``a repetitive system that demands attention to safety
and accountability.''
   The Navy released figures saying that since the beginning of
this year, there have been 101 ``operation and training related''
fatalities throughout the service.
   However, included in this number are the 47 fatalities that
resulted from the explosion on board the USS Iowa. Excluding those,
there have been 54 fatalities this year, the Navy said.
   The Navy counted 64 operation and training related fatalities in
1984; 61 in 1985; 56 in 1986; 72 in 1987, and 63 in 1988.
   Rep. Charles Bennett, D-Fla., chairman of the House Armed
Services subcommittee on seapower and strategic and critical
materials, said ``these tragic, these sad'' events are ``not in
substance very much connected.''
   Bennett said the incidents of the past week could be viewed as a
``product of bad luck, but that doesn't mean we can't use them to
prepare for the future.''
   In the latest incident, the Navy reported that nine sailors
suffered smoke inhalation and four of those were treated for burns
following an early morning fire in a boiler aboard the USS
Monongahela, some 500 miles west of Gibraltar.
   The others include:
   _Three sailors and a reported $4 million worth of non-nuclear
missiles were swept by a wave from the aircraft carrier USS
Eisenhower near Cape Hatteras, N.C. on Tuesday, with one sailor
still missing and presumed dead.
   _A sailor aboard the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson fell into
the Pacific about 620 miles north of Wake Island late Monday and
was presumed lost.
   _A F@A-18 pilot dropped a 500-pound bomb on the guided missile
cruiser USS Reeves in the Indian Ocean also on Monday, causing
minor injuries to five sailors and blowing a five-foot hole in the
ship's bow.
   _In the week's most deadly event, a jet pilot making his first
landing on an aircraft carrier crashed into the USS Lexington in
the Gulf of Mexico on Sunday, killing him and four others on the
deck of the huge ship.

   The managing editor of the Bristol Bay
News glued his resignation notice to more than 1,000 copies of the
weekly newspaper, then went to work for the paper's competitor.
   David McElroy said he resigned after one month on the job
because his former boss, Publisher John Lindauer, is planning to
run for governor and gave him no control over the newspaper.
   ``It's really unethical for a journalistic operation to be
controlled by a politician,'' McElroy said Wednesday. ``He's more
or less stated that he intends to control political news. I told
him that's unethical and I wouldn't be a part of that.''
   Lindauer, a former Republican state legislator, said from
Anchorage that he had not yet decided whether to run for governor
in 1990. He said he resigned Wednesday as president and chief
executive officer of his company, Lindauer Newspapers and Radio, to
pursue other interests including politics.
   He denied that his politics had anything to do with McElroy's
resignation.
   ``He only worked for us for about 30 days. I was gone almost all
that time in California,'' Lindauer said. ``Let me put it this way:
It was bizarre behavior under any circumstance.''
   McElroy, 37, joined the Bristol BayTimes as a reporter less than
a week after his 3-by-5 resignation notice was glued to copies of
the Oct. 20 edition of the Bay News. McElroy said he pasted the
notice on the paper to underscore his lack of authority.
   Dillingham is a fishing port of 2,100 residents along Bristol
Bay on the southern coast of Alaska.

Thursday, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange edged
downward.
   The dollar ended at 143.75 yen, up 0.67 yen from Wednesday's
143.08-yen finish. It opened higher at 143.93 yen and ranged
between 143.65 yen and 144.15 yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 69.57 points, or 0.20
percent, closing at 35,494.86. It had gained 14.99 points the
previous day.
   Dealers said the index fell as market players were discouraged
by the yen's weakness against the dollar, as well as by an uptrend
in domestic short-term interest rates.
   Nikko Securities dealer Yoshio Shimoyama said, ``Market players,
especially institutional investors, were reluctant to make major
moves prior to the U.S. jobless rate release later Friday and a
three-day weekend.''
   The United States is to release the nation's unemployment figure
for October on Friday in Washington. Japanese financial markets
will close Friday for Culture Day, a national holiday.
   In currency dealings, the dollar started higher following a
similar upswing on overseas markets overnight.
   ``Market players were afraid of the Bank of Japan's
intervention, and started selling the currency in early trading,
which pushed down the dollar a bit temporarily. But the dollar rose
back as investment trust companies bought it back,'' said a trader
with Mitsubishi Bank.
   Japan's central bank sold dollars to support the yen, but the
amount of its intervention was unclear. The Bank of Japan does not
comment on its monetary actions.
   Speaking anonymously, the Mitsubishi Bank trader said Japanese
investors are buying the dollar because they think U.S. interest
rates will not fall soon, even though U.S. economic growth has
slowed.
   ``Even if U.S. interest rates fall, they will still be much
higher than Japanese rates, and more profitable,'' the trader said.
   Higher interest rates tend to support the price of a country's
currency.

<HEAD>Khamenei Calls For ``Perpetual Struggle'' Against U.S.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEX EFTY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TEHRAN, Iran (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As a wave of anti-Americanism sweeps Iran,
the country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called on
citizens ``to wage perpetual struggle'' against the United States.
   Khamenei addressed hundreds of students Wednesday, the same day
Parliament passed a law giving the government powers to arrest
Americans anywhere and put them on trial if they seek to harm
Iranians or the Islamic republic.
   The move came three days before expected mass anti-American
demonstrations to mark Saturday's 10th anniversary of the seizure
of the U.S. Embassy.
   Militants stormed the sprawling embassy complex Nov. 4, 1979 and
held 52 diplomats and other embassy personnel hostage for 444 days.
   ``The dismay and shame resulting from this humiliation will
always remain on the face of the oppressor ringleaders of the
United States,'' said Khamenei, a former president and successor to
the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   Iran's state-run television network broadcast Khamenei's
address. It showed students punching the air with their fists and
chanting ``Death to America!'' and ``Khamenei is our leader. We
obey your orders, Khamenei.''
   Western and Third World diplomats believe anti-American feeling
is being whipped up by radicals to undermine reported efforts by
President Hashemi Rafsanjani, leader of Iran's so-called
pragmatists, to improve relations with the West and end the
country's isolation.
   The new law was enacted in response to the U.S. Justice
Department's action earlier this year authorizing the FBI to arrest
people wanted by U.S. courts anywhere in the world, without seeking
permission of the countries where they are located, and bring them
to trial in the United States.
   The U.S. action did not specify Iran. But the Islamic republic
is one of several states Washington considers to support and
encourage terrorism, including the kidnapping of Americans and
other Westerners in Lebanon, assassinations and hijackings.
   Iranian radicals saw the Justice Department's action as aimed at
the Islamic republic and an opportunity to exploit anti-U.S.
sentiment to counter Rafsanjani's policies, diplomats said.
   ``U.S. citizens and their agents, and countries which
collaborate with the United States in kidnapping or endangering
Iranian citizens or the interests of the Islamic republic, will be
tried by Iranian courts according to Islamic justice,'' the new law
declares.
   Hundreds of students packed the covered lawn in the grounds of
Khamenei's official residence in downtown Tehran on Wednesday.
Among them were representatives of some of the main groups that
have called for a massive protest outside the former embassy
Saturday.
   These include the ``Students following the Imam's line,'' the
group that stormed the embassy, the Association of Militant Clergy,
and Students of the Intelligence Ministry College.
   A leading cleric, Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, declared: ``As long
as the Islamic revolution exists, U.S. hostility will not cease. As
long as our enemy is America, the struggle against it tops all our
efforts.''

<HEAD>Partisan Battle Continues Over Capital Gains Tax</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Major fiscal legislation is being held up on
Capitol Hill by the partisan wrestling over President Bush's call
for a cut in the capital gains tax.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater on Wednesday reiterated
the administration's position, with congressional Republicans in
strong support, that the GOP was willing to live with the $16
billion in automatic spending cuts which were ordered last month
under the Gramm-Rudman law.
   The cuts _ half from defense and half from domestic programs _
were mandated because Congress and Bush have failed to agree on
alternative ways of reducing the federal deficit.
   ``We're prepared to go that route if that's what it takes to get
some leverage,'' said House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill.
   But Democrats said they felt politically confident if
Republicans wanted to hold education grants, agriculture subsidies,
national defense and a host of other popular programs hostage to a
capital gains tax cut.
   Republicans claim the tax cut, which Bush promised in his
campaign, would be a boon to the economy. Democrats say it's a
giveaway to the rich.
   ``That's not a bad battleground for me. I'll take it,'' said
Rep. William H. Gray III, D-Pa., the House majority whip. If
Republicans want to cut programs for average Americans ``to provide
tax breaks for Donald Trump ... I'll be glad to debate that from
the cornfields of Iowa to the bayous of Louisiana.''
   The House has passed a plan to cut the tax rate on capital
gains, but it has been blocked in the Senate by a parliamentary
move led by Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine.
   The deadlock is holding up such matters as revising or repealing
the Medicare catastrophic illness plan and a much-needed bill to
raise the government's debt limit.
   If the Treasury isn't given new borrowing authority next week,
it could be forced to default and bring major damage to the
government's world financial position.

   An ``awesome'' aftershock to the
devastating Oct. 17 earthquake jolted Northern California late
Wednesday, panicking people from San Francisco to Watsonville.
   The tremor caused some minor damage but there were no immediate
reports of injuries.
   The aftershock hit shortly before 10 p.m. and was felt in San
Francisco, Santa Cruz and Watsonville.
   ``It rattled pretty good at first and then kept on kind of
rolling. You could feel the foundation swaying,'' said Ani
LeRitz-Murphy of Watsonville.
   The 9:50 p.m. aftershock measured 4.4 on the Richter scale of
ground motion and was centered slightly north of the epicenter of
last month's magnitude-7.1 quake, said Pat Jorgenson, spokeswoman
for the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park.
   San Francisco police said there was only minor damage in the
city's Marina district, which was devastated by the main quake.
   ``We've had a couple of reports of minor stuff nothing major at
this time, just bricks falling, people calling in sheer panic
saying, `The big one is on the way.' We try to console them and
tell them it's an aftershock,'' said Officer Gordon Clark.
   ``Awesome,'' said Santa Cruz County sheriff's dispatcher Kevin
Fink. ``Shook pretty good. We were sweating bullets for a few
seconds.''
   There have been thousands of aftershocks and 84 have had Richter
readings of at least 3.0 and 21 of magnitude-4.0 or greater. The
strongest registered 5.2, just 37 minutes after the initial jolt.
   ``This is one of the biggest I've felt since I got here on the
19th,'' said Lt. Jeffrey Babineu at the National Guard Armory in
Watsonville, which is housing 100 people left homeless by the quake.
   ``We heard a rumbling, then everything started rolling and the
cars in the parking lot started jumping around,'' he said. ``A few
of the people in the shelter screamed out, but then it stopped.''
   Watsonville police received about a dozen calls from people who
were worried about any additional damage the aftershock might have
caused their already damaged homes, said dispatcher Terry Hernandez.
   ``Apparently a lot of people ran out into the street,'' she
said. ``We got a call from an apartment complex and they said
everyone ran out.''
   She said there were no immediate reports of damage.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage.

<HEAD>House Votes to Give Transportation Secretary Powers He Doesn't Want</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House wants to give the Transportation
secretary new authority to halt airline mergers or leverage buyouts
even though the secretary says he doesn't need more power.
   The House on Wednesday passed 300-113 a bill to require
government rejection of any airline takeover that might affect
safety, hinder competition, cut a carrier's size, affect jobs or
result in foreign control of an airline.
   Under the legislation, which now goes to the Senate, the
secretary is to determine whether transactions meet the standards
before they are completed, but he also will have the power to
approve any merger if he believes it is in the public interest.
   Current law calls for a department review of airline
acquisitions after they have been completed and based only on
considerations of safety, financial fitness and foreign control.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner says he doesn't want the
new authority and would recommend a presidential veto. The vote
exceeded the two-thirds majority necessary to override a veto.
   The House added two amendments which are opposed by Democrat and
Republican leaders of the Public Works Committee.
   One change extended the authority to cover any takeover that
would reduce wages, benefits or the number of employees at the
affected airline. Opponents said this would be interference in
management-employee relations.
   Another change, aimed at Texas Air Corp. owner Frank Lorenzo,
would bar anyone who has sent more than one airline into bankruptcy
from acquiring another airline. Lorenzo has filed for bankruptcy
reorganization of Eastern Airlines and took a similar step with
Continental Airlines.
   The bill was prompted by increasing concern over leveraged
buyouts in the airline industry, including the sale of Northwest
Airlines and aborted attempts to take over American and United
airlines.
   Skinner last month used his review authority to force changes in
Alfred Checchi's buyout of Northwest's parent company, NWA Inc.,
reducing the interest of KLM Royal Dutch Airlines.
   Skinner has said he has enough power under current law to stop
unworthy takeovers.
   The House rejected efforts by Rep. Ron Packard, R-Calif., to
make the secretary's rejection of takeovers discretionary rather
than mandatory.
   Sponsors said the secretary's authority to determine whether a
takeover is in the national interest gives him the necessary
latitude.

<HEAD>USDA: Off-Farm Earnings Sets Record</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jobs in town for years have been vital for
thousands of farm families whose paychecks often exceed what they
earn from the land.
   The Agriculture Department says off-farm earnings in 1988 were a
record $51.7 billion, up from the previous high of $46.8 billion in
1987. Total U.S. net cash income from farming last year was also a
record _ $59.9 billion, up from $57.7 billion in 1987.
   Last year's off-farm income, which includes that of all family
members as well as the farm operator, exceeded net cash income from
farming in all years prior to 1986, according to department
analysts.
   In some years, most recently 1984, off-farm earnings were more
than net farm cash income, which is the difference between annual
cash expenses and gross cash income from farming operations.
   State-by-state income, off-farm earnings and other data were
reported by USDA this week in a new 240-page report, part of an
annual financial series about the agricultural sector.
   Robert P. Williams of the department's Economic Research Service
said Wednesday no attempt was made to rank the states according to
off-farm income. But he did compile at the request of The
Associated Press the top 10 off-farm earners in 1988.
   Farm income surpassed off-farm income last year in only three
states of the top 10 _ California, Illinois and Iowa. Off-farm
earnings exceeded farm income in the remaining seven: Texas, Ohio,
Missouri, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee and Oklahoma.
   Texas, which leads the nation in the number of farms _ an
estimated 188,000 last year _ also led in 1988 off-farm earnings
with more than $5 billion. That was well above the state's net cash
farm income last year of less than $3.9 billion.
   Others in the top 10 in 1988 off-farm income, in order, included:
   _California, $2.66 billion off the farm and a net cash farm
income of $6.54 billion; the state was reported to have an
estimated 84,000 farms.
   _Ohio, $2.36 billion in off-farm income and a net cash farm
income of $1.44 billion; an estimated 85,000 farms.
   _Missouri, $2.22 billion in off-farm income and $1.48 billion
net cash farm income; an estimated 110,000 farms.
   _Indiana, $2.12 billion in off-farm income and $1.48 billion net
cash farm income; an estimated 74,000 farms.
   _Kentucky, $2.1 billion in off-farm income and $1.09 billion net
cash farm income; an estimated 97,000 farms.
   _Tennessee, $2 billion in off-farm income and $818.1 million net
cash farm income; an estimated 91,000 farms.
   _Illinois, $1.95 billion in off-farm income and $2.63 billion
net cash farm income; an estimated 88,000 farms.
   _Oklahoma, $1.84 billion in off-farm income and $1.23 billion
net cash farm income; an estimated 70,000 farms.
   _Iowa, $1.81 billion in off-farm income and $3.44 billion net
cash farm income; an estimated 107,000 farms.

   A mechanical digester is being developed to
safely dispose of waste water after farm sprayers are flushed to
rid them of pesticides, says the Agriculture Department.
   The department's Agricultural Research Service said Wednesday
that the portable treatment uses ozone gas and soil microorganisms
to break down unused pesticides before disposal.
   Cathleen J. Somich, a chemist at the agency's Beltsville, Md.,
research facility, said the goal is to turn unused pesticides into
innocuous carbon dioxide instead of converting them into other
toxic compounds that are disposed of by burning.
   ``We don't want to take the risk of substituting air pollution
for water pollution,'' she said in an agency report.
   Ciba-Geigy Corp. of Greensboro, N.C., has entered into a
cooperative agreement with the agency to continue with the
development of the procedure and the device to see if it can handle
larger volumes of pesticide, officials said.
   The treatment was originated at Beltsville. Somich and agency
colleagues a year ago tested the original apparatus with seed money
from Ciba-Geigy, using it on 150 gallons of ``typical pesticide
soup'' consisting of detergent and water used to clean corn
herbicides from spray tanks.
   Within three days, the treatment destroyed between 46 percent
and 96 percent of the chemicals used in the sprayer by subjecting
them to a digestion process aided by the ozone gas.
   Somich said that pesticides are resistant to microbial digestion
but the ozone treatment oxidizes and makes them more biodegradable.
   The technology is far from the commercial stage, but Steve
Dumford, Ciba-Geigy's director of new technology and basic
research, said he envisions the device one day being transported
from farm to farm for the treatment of pesticides and waste water
left over from cleaning chemical sprayers.
   Department officials said the process might also be used by lawn
care companies.

   The Agriculture Department says the United
States in August exported an estimated 13 billion cigarettes valued
at $317.1 million.
   A report by the department's Foreign Agricultural Service said
August shipments were up 32 percent in volume and 42 percent in
value from a year earlier.
   But exports of unmanufactured tobacco in August totaled 10,777
metric tons worth $57.9 million, down 6 percent in volume and 17
percent in value from the year-earlier level, the agency said.

<HEAD>White House Denies `Litmus Test'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House denies it has a ``litmus
test'' for its appointments, but concedes Dr. Antonia Novello never
would have been named surgeon general if her abortion views clashed
with those of President Bush.
   Novello's selection as the nation's chief public health officer
was announced on Wednesday. A pediatrician and expert on AIDS in
children, she would be the first woman and the first Hispanic to
hold the post if confirmed by the Senate.
   She would succeed the outspoken C. Everett Koop, who served for
seven years.
   Her nomination comes amid controversy over White House
questioning of candidates for a variety of health positions on
their abortion views.
   Presidential Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater acknowledged such
screening took place, but defended it. ``We don't hire people that
don't support our policies,'' he said.
   In this case, Novello ``supports the president's policies,'' he
said.
   Although the president's own position has changed since 1980 _
when he voiced support for the Roe vs. Wade Supreme Court decision
legalizing abortion _ he currently opposes all abortions except to
protect the life of the mother or in cases of rape or incest.
   On the issue of federal funds, his views are more restrictive.
Within the past month he vetoed two bills that sought to expand
federally financed Medicaid abortions to include cases of rape or
incest.
   The current restriction _ supported by Bush _ only permits the
use of federal funds to pay for abortions for poor women when the
mother's life is in danger.
   Fitzwater on Wednesday insisted ``there's no litmus test'' for
top appointments.
   Still, Fitzwater continued, ``you can call it whatever you want,
but the fact is, yes, anybody who is coming into a policy-making
position will be asked what their beliefs are and whether they can
support our policies.''
   ``We don't hire people that don't support our policies. That is
a hard and fast rule,'' Fitzwater said.
   However, he said the rule does not apply to judicial
appointments or to government jobs below the policy-making level.
It does apply, however, to officials approximately from the rank of
assistant Cabinet secretary on up, he said.
   Louis W. Sullivan, the secretary of Health and Human Services,
found his own selection by then President-elect Bush in jeopardy
last December when he was quoted in an Atlanta newspaper as
favoring a pro-abortion-rights stance.
   Sullivan, who then was the president of the Morehouse School of
Medicine, issued a statement to ``clarify'' his position to assert
it was ``entirely consistent'' with Bush's.
   Novello's nomination had been widely reported in advance of
Wednesday's announcement.
   A native of Puerto Rico, Novello, 45, is deputy director of the
National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, one of
the National Institutes of Health. She is also coordinator for AIDS
research.
   She graduated from the University of Puerto Rico and in 1970
from the university's medical school in the top 5 percent of her
class.
   She is married to Dr. Joe Novello, a child psychiatrist who
hosted a talk show on a Washington radio station offering advice
for troubled adolescents. Her brother-in-law is Don Novello, the
comedian better known as ``Father Guido Sarducci.''

<HEAD>Doubts Raised About Safety Improvements at Weapons Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An advisor to Energy Secretary James D.
Watkins is questioning the success of Watkins' effort to improve
safety at the idled Savannah River reactors that make gas for
nuclear warheads.
   John Ahearne, chairman of Watkins' independent advisory panel on
nuclear safety, said Wednesday that Watkins' stricter safety
approach apparently has not yet penetrated the middle management
and lower-level workers at Savannah River.
   ``What we are questioning is the effectiveness'' of
safety-related improvement programs at Savannah River, which is
operated by Westinghouse Electric Corp. under an Energy Department
contract, Ahearne said in a telephone interview.
   The Ahearne panel said in a letter to Watkins last Friday that
Westinghouse appeared to be relying on its training program to
impart the new emphasis on safety.
   ``This will not be enough,'' the letter said.
   At Savannah River, near Aiken, S.C., Westinghouse spokeswoman
Becky Apter said the company has made numerous improvements in
safety training programs to bring the plant up to the standards of
the civilian nuclear industry.
   Ms. Apter declined to directly dispute the Ahearne panel's
assertions but said the group was told during a visit to the plant
last September that numerous improvements were under way, including
training on reactor simulators.
   Ahearne's group applauded what it called numerous positive
changes at Savannah River since Westinghouse took over last April,
but it also raised serious questions.
   ``Procedural errors and reporting problems continue and indicate
that an emphasis on safety of operations is not yet pervasive,''
the panel said in its report to Watkins.
   The plant's nuclear reactors, the nation's only source of
tritium used to make nuclear warheads, have been shut down for more
than a year for safety reasons that include doubts about the skills
and attitudes of plant workers.
   An accident during an attempted restart of one Savannah River
reactor in August 1988 led to the hiatus. The accident was
attributed in part to operator error and led to investigations that
uncovered deep-seated safety lapses.
   Watkins has made getting the Savannah River reactors running
again by next year a top priority.
   Ahearne panel's conclusions suggest Savannah River's flaws are
far from fixed.
   The panel said it was generally pleased with Westinghouse's
program for training reactor operators, but the training was
``missing coverage of reactors fundamentals'' that are always
included in training for commercial nuclear plants.
   ``This omission ... may belie Westinghouse's claim that safety
is their primary concern,'' the report said.
   Watkins has raised questions about Westinghouse's commitment to
Savannah River.
   In a letter to Westinghouse president Paul Lego in July, Watkins
said his review of the company's blueprint for restarting the
reactors caused him concern ``that Westinghouse still does not
appreciate the magnitude of the problems it faces.''
   Copies of the July 17 letter and Lego's response were obtained
Wednesday by The Associated Press under the Freedom of Information
Act.
   Watkins, citing a concern that Ahearne said still remains,
suggested to Lego that more competent people should be assigned to
Savannah River to resolve the safety problems.
   ``Let me reiterate that I am more concerned with the
capabilities of the individuals involved than numbers of people,''
Watkins wrote. ``It would be a grave mistake to imagine that the
problems cited can be corrected merely by adding to the numbers.''

   President Bush's nomination of Debra R.
Bowland to head the Labor Department's wage and hour division will
not get to the Senate floor because of a Senate panel's vote
against her confirmation.
   The Labor and Human Resources Committee voted 9-6 on Wednesday
not to send her nomination to the full Senate.
   Opponents focused on Bowland's campaign to repeal Louisiana's
prevailing wage law, the state equivalent of the federal
Davis-Bacon law that sets wage scales for work on government
construction contracts. The law is a favorite of organized labor.
   Prevailing wages are the going pay and benefits in a geographic
area, and usually are tied to union scales. Critics of the law say
it artificially raises the cost of construction.
   Committee Chairman Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., criticized the
nomination, holding up copies of the federal and state laws and
saying they were ``virtually identical.''
   ``This is the law she would have to implement and this is the
law she could not implement,'' Kennedy said.
   Bowland, 45, began fighting the Louisiana law while she was
state labor secretary from 1980 to 1982 under Gov. David Treen, a
Republican. She later campaigned against the law as a lobbyist.
   Bowland told senators at a hearing last week that she could
enforce the federal law.
   But Democrats said her vigorous past lobbying proved her deep
philosophical objection to government involvement in wage and hour
matters.
   ``This is putting the fox in charge of the chicken coop,'' said
Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., added, ``We shouldn't put somebody in
charge of a law that they don't believe in _ period.''
   But Sen. James M. Jeffords, R-Vt., said Bowland opposed the
Louisiana law because of problems with implementation and

<HEAD>Book Alleges Kennedy May Have Staged Bridge Accident to Cover Earlier
Wreck</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new book on the 1969 Chappaquiddick case
alleges that Sen. Edward M. Kennedy may have staged the fatal
bridge accident to cover up an earlier car wreck that same night.
   In a book released today to Washington media, author Kenneth
Kappel said ``previously overlooked'' evidence indicates that
Kennedy may have pushed his black Oldsmobile off the Dyke Bridge to
cover up an earlier accident and to conceal his own drunken state.
   Kennedy's Senate office had no immediate reaction to the book.
   Titled ``Chappaquiddick Revealed,'' the book raises new
allegations about the events of July 18, 1969, when the
Massachusetts Democrat and 28-year-old Mary Jo Kopechne were
involved in an accident that claimed Kopechne's life.
   The book is published by Shapolsky Publishers Inc., a small New
York firm.
   Gwen and Joseph Kopechne, the victim's parents, released a
statement calling for Kennedy to respond.
   ``We believe that Mr. Kappel's book does present new evidence,
and that it is worthy of serious attention,'' the Kopechnes said.
   Kappel's book contends the car driven by Kennedy with Ms.
Kopechne in the passenger seat was involved in an accident on dry
land on Chappaquiddick Island. According to Kappel, the car rolled
over onto its roof. The author theorized that Kennedy believed
Kopechne was killed in the accident, got help in righting the car
and then pushed it off the Dyke Bridge.
   Kappel's book said all of the damage to the car could not have
been caused by the plummet off the wooden bridge, and that
bloodstains found on Ms. Kopechne's blouse were dried stains from a
previous accident. Also, he said a dangling left side-view mirror
could indicate a common technique in pushing cars into water: tying
the mirror to the steering wheel to steady the vehicle.

<HEAD>Ban to be Continued on Federally Funded Fetal Tissue Research</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is allowing the rising
fever over abortion politics to get in the way of scientific
research, say critics of a ban on the use of federal money for
fetal tissue research.
   A top federal health official said Wednesday he intends to
extend indefinitely the ban on using tissue from intentional
abortions in federal research. Assistant Health Secretary James
Mason contended Wednesday such testing could create a demand for
more abortions.
   ``I see this as suppression of legitimate science in the federal
sector,'' said John C. Fletcher, director of the Center for
Biomedical Ethics at the University of Virginia. ``When political
considerations dominate science, it concerns me very, very much.''
   Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce health subcommittee, said continuing the ban would be an
indication that the Bush administration ``is giving up any pretense
about caring about research or treating sick people or curing
chronic disease.''
   He added: ``The whole administration has become paralyzed by
fear of the abortion issue, when that's not the main issue before
us.''
   Waxman called on Health and Human Services Secretary Louis
Sullivan to reverse a decision planned by Mason to extend the ban.
He said Sullivan's job as secretary is ``to lead, not hide.''
   But HHS sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity said
Sullivan will concur with Mason's decision. An announcement was
expected today.
   Conservatives have pressed the administration to continue the
ban, warning that lifting it would create a firestorm of protest
from anti-abortion groups.
   The ban was imposed a year ago by Mason's predecessor as
assistant secretary for health, Robert Windom, when he rejected a
proposed project at the National Institutes of Health in which
scientists would transplant fetal tissue into patients with
Parkinson's disease.
   Windom also formed a special advisory committee to study whether
such federally funded research should continue. Late last year, the
committee recommended lifting the ban.
   The ban does not include fetal tissue from spontaneous abortions
and does not constrain privately financed research using tissue
from induced abortions.
   Scientists believe that research using tissue from aborted
fetuses could help treat Parkinson's disease and other incurable
conditions. The tissue is valued for its unique properties and
quick growth, allowing it to adapt quickly to new environments.
   The focus of fetal tissue research so far has been on
Parkinson's disease, but experts say it may also be useful in
treating other neurological degenerative diseases.
   ``NIH is supposed to be a partner with science in the private
area,'' said Fletcher, who was chief of the bioethics program at
the clinical center at NIH for a decade. ``This is the only area in
our scientific life that is being systematically suppressed in the
federal sector.''
   Mason, a strong abortion foe, said he opposes using federal
money to support research on fetal tissue from induced abortions
for moral reasons, saying it could lead to more abortions.
   Ultimately, he said, society would have to trade off the rights
of a fetus for those of a patient suffering from Parkinson's
disease or other condition that might benefit from fetal tissue.
   ``Even those that strongly favor fetal tissue transplantation
acknowledge that a strict wall would have to be erected between the
abortion decision and the decision to use fetal tissue in
transplantation research,'' Mason said. ``Such a distinction is
easy to theorize, but I just don't believe that such a neat
separation can be accomplished.''
   ``For anyone who believes that a fetus has some rights, then I
just find that this is unacceptable public policy,'' he said.

<HEAD>Tighter Rules Set for Radioactive Releases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is imposing tighter standards
for radioactive releases from hospitals, nuclear power plants and
other facilities, but some environmentalists say the rules don't go
far enough.
   Hospitals, research labs and atomic power plants already meet
the new requirements set by the Environmental Protection Agency,
officials said Wednesday.
   Some environmentalists complained the new regulations do not go
far enough and allow too high a cancer risk for residents living
near such facilities.
   The Environmental Protection Agency said the tighter standards
aim at reducing the cancer risk from industrial radioactive
releases to no greater than 1 in 10,000 over a lifetime for persons
living near the facility causing the pollution. Today, those risks
are from two to 12 times as great near some of the facilities, the
EPA said.
   ``The rules will protect public health from the risks of
industrial radioactivity,'' said William Rosenberg, the EPA's
assistant administrator for air and radiation.
   But some environmentalists said even tighter controls are needed
on industrial radionuclide emissions, which are a byproduct of many
nuclear processes used in industry and medicine. They maintain that
a minimum risk level of 1 cancer in 1 million over a lifetime is
justified for even persons living near the facilities.
   ``We in the environmental community are not prepared to call 1
in 10,000 a safe level of exposure,'' said David Doniger, an
attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council.
   Rosenberg said the risk level sought by the environmentalists
would be counterproductive because it would result in ``significant
reductions'' in the amount of radioactive therapy for cancer. The
National Institutes of Health maintained in comments to the EPA
that tighter controls might result in the added loss of life
because it could hamper some cancer treatments.
   The new EPA regulations were issued 10 years after the federal
Clean Air Act called on the agency to establish emission standards
for radioactive byproducts. A lawsuit by environmentalists directed
that the EPA produce the new standards.
   The new emissions requirements cover nearly 7,000 facilities
including hospitals, research laboratories, pharmaceutical plants,
atomic waste storage plants and electric utility generating plants
as well as uranium mines.
   Richard Guimond, director of the EPA's office of radiation, said
most of the facilities already meet the new standard.
   Nevertheless, he estimated that currently as many as 10,000
people may live in areas where exposure to radioactive pollution
poses a cancer risk greater than the 1 in 10,000 required by the
new regulation.
   Among those facilities that, according to the EPA, will have to
curb radioactive emissions to come into compliance with the new
requirements are:
   _Seven of the country's 15 underground uranium mines at a cost
to the industry of $400,000 a year. As many as five of the mines
may choose instead to shut down, officials said.
   _A number of Energy Department sites where excessive radon is
released from radioactive wastes, some dating back to the early
days of the nuclear program in the 1940s and 1950s.
   _Some of the country's five operating elemental phosphorous
plants where health risks to nearby residents exceed EPA standards.
A phosphorous plant in Pocatello, Idaho, likely will have to
install a $2.4 million scrubber to reduce emissions because
radioactive pollution there poses an estimated cancer risk 12 times
as great as the 1 in 10,000 standard allows, according to the EPA.

<HEAD>Senate Moving Toward Decision in Mississippi Impeachment Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate is closing its doors for the second
time in two weeks to debate the ouster of a federal judge as it
moves toward a decision in the impeachment trial of Walter L. Nixon
Jr. of Mississippi.
   ``The evidence against Judge Nixon is overwhelming,'' Rep. Don
Edwards, D-Calif., said Wednesday as Senate floor action got under
way. ``To maintain the integrity of the judiciary he must be
removed.''
   Nixon, currently living in a New Orleans halfway house for
former prisoners, would be the seventh federal official removed by
impeachment and the second judge ousted in two weeks if convicted
by the Senate.
   As a U.S. District judge, he continues to collect an $89,500
government salary and says he would like to return to the bench and
preside over trials despite his 1986 conviction for lying under
oath to a federal grand jury.
   The House on May 10 approved 417-0 three articles of impeachment
against the 61-year-old judge. Conviction in the Senate on any one
of them would automatically remove him from the bench.
   The Senate planned to go into closed session today to debate the
matter after hearing final arguments on Wednesday. Lawmakers were
likely to put off a vote until Friday.
   The Senate on Oct. 20 ousted Alcee L. Hastings from the U.S.
District Court in Miami on charges he plotted to obtain a bribe and
lied to a jury that acquitted him of that charge in 1983.
   Nixon was convicted of lying to a federal grand jury in denying
he talked with a local prosecutor and old friend, Paul Holmes,
about marijuana-smuggling charges against Drew Fairchild, the son
of a wealthy contractor.
   Holmes was district attorney of Forrest County, Miss., at the
time and the marijuana charges became inactive after the
discussion, prosecutors said.
   Nixon took the Senate floor and denied any wrongdoing. He said
witnesses against him lied and that overzealous prosecutors held
him to an unfairly high standard of accuracy in his sworn
statements.
   ``I had nothing to hide,'' Nixon said. ``I had done nothing
wrong. I had not committed any corrupt act ... why would I lie
about something that I hadn't done?''
   He assured lawmakers he had always acted fairly in his courtroom
in accord with advice from ``my good friend, Sen. John C. Stennis.''
   Stennis retired in 1988 after representing Mississippi in the
Senate for four decades.
   ``I have served honestly and faithfully as a federal judge for
21 years,'' Nixon said. ``I have always been mindful that I was
appointed, not anointed.''
   Defense counsel David Stewart acknowledged forgetfulness in
Nixon's testimony but said there was no attempt to deceive the
government.
   One of the House managers of the case, Rep. James Sensenbrenner,
R-Wis., scoffed at that notion. ``Are they deceits or just a series
of mistakes?'' he said in an incredulous voice. ``Fourteen
mistakes.''
   Stewart also told the Senate the charges against Nixon did not
accurately reflect the actual words of the judge when he was under
oath.
   ``They are asking you to send him to dishonor in history for
lying about statements that he didn't make,'' Stewart said.
   Nixon said it would be understandable if senators believed
``something is wrong'' merely because the case has come before them.
   ``There is something wrong with this situation,'' Nixon said.
``But what is wrong is that I am paying a debt that is not owed ...
From the very beginning the goal of the federal prosecutors was to
get the federal judge, no matter what it took, and it took plenty.''

   The Bush administration is telling exile
leaders of the Afghan resistance it will keep sending them arms to
fight the Soviet-backed government in Afghanistan, officials say.
   ``They assured us of their continued support,'' said Farooq
Azam, the education minister of the Afghan Interim Government,
which is based in Peshawar, Pakistan, near the border with
Afghanistan.
   Azam led a delegation that met Wednesday with Vice President Dan
Quayle and on Tuesday with Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   A spokesman for the vice president, David Beckwith, said
``Quayle assured them of our continuing support. We continue to
support an independent and representative government for
Afghanistan.''
   U.S. military assistance to the mujahedeen guerrillas slackened
after Soviet troops withdrew last February, hampering efforts to
dislodge government forces from heavily fortified cities, Azam said
in an interview.
   ``This year, we did not even receive the amount we received last
year,'' he said. ``Our friends have slowed down their assistance.''
   Deliveries have resumed, say U.S. officials who spoke on
condition they not be identified. They declined to discuss details
of the covert program, which was estimated at close to $600 million
last year.
   Asked whether the aid was sufficient to dislodge government
forces from fortified cities they have occupied, Azam said, ``we
will see.''
   The mujahedeen need more weapons now, he said, because they are
mounting offensives and sieges against fortified military
positions, a tactic which generally requires more armaments than
the guerrilla warfare used earlier.
   ``We need support now more than ever,'' he said.
   U.S. and mujahedeen sources say Moscow has continued to send
huge quantities of arms to the regime the Russians left behind even
though Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said last
week the 1979 Red Army intervention in Afghanistan violated moral
and civilized behavior.
   ``We believe that since the Soviet withdrawal, there has been a
kind of thinking in the United States that the war is over,'' Azam
said.
   In talks with Quayle and Baker, he said, ``we made our point
that the war is not over.''
   The Soviets left $2 billion worth of military hardware when they
withdrew, and have sent an additional $3 billion since then, said
Azam.
   The increase in Soviet aid and drop in U.S. assistance
frustrated mujahedeen efforts to take cities such as Jalalabad, in
eastern Afghanistan, he said.
   The Dec. 2-3 meeting between President Bush and Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev was not discussed in the meetings with
administration officials, said Azam.
   ``We don't think that the United States will reach an agreement
with the Soviet Union that would harm the resistance,'' he said.

<HEAD>Trade Rep Says Nations Reacting to U.S. Copyright Pressure</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign nations are getting the message that
the United States will no longer tolerate the theft of its films,
records, books and computer software, an administration official
says.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla A. Hills said Wednesday eight
nations considered the worst violators of U.S. intellectual
property rights have improved their copyright protection enough
that they won't be subject to increased pressure allowed under the
1988 omnibus trade act.
   The act calls for any nation placed on a ``priority nations
list'' to face an accelerated six-month investigation.
   ``I am encouraged by the genuine progress made in the protection
of intellectual property by our trading partners,'' Hills said in a
prepared statement. ``Clearly, our message has been received.''
   But the situation will be reviewed in April, she added.
   U.S. companies have complained they are losing hundreds of
millions of dollars a year to foreign pirates or to foreign
government policies that exclude American competitors.
   In its 1988 trade law, Congress directed the trade
representative to identify nations that violate U.S. copyrights or
deny access to U.S. intellectual property.
   On May 25, Hills singled out 25 countries, naming eight to a
``priority watch list'' and saying talks would begin with them.
   Hills said South Korea, Taiwan and Saudi Arabia had made enough
improvement that they were downgraded from the priority watch list
to simple ``watch list'' status.
   The other five _ Brazil, India, Mexico, People's Republic of
China and Thailand _ will remain on the priority watch list.
   Tougher pressure could have been called for if the countries had
been upgraded to the higher ``priority nations list.''
   Hills said Saudi Arabia had agreed to enact a copyright law;
Taiwan issued high-level policy statements, moved towards better
law enforcement and initialed a bilateral copyright agreement; and
South Korea had improved policing efforts.
   Eric Smith, general counsel for the International Intellectual
Property Alliance, said the group was pleased overall with Hills'
decision, but that April will provide a ``litmus test'' of these
nations' intentions.
   He said his group also was concerned ``that by dropping Taiwan
and Korea, particularly, off the priority watch list, it's not a
sign they can lay off their commitment to enforcement.''
   ``In both countries they have made some improvements in the
enforcement area, but they're not there yet,'' Smith said.
   He said it would be a ``major advance'' if Saudi Arabia enacts a
copyright law, which Smith said would be a first for a Persian Gulf
nation.
   Jay Berman, president of the Recording Industry Association of
America, said Hills had won ``meaningful negotiations,'' but ``the
real test is whether they're going to produce concrete results on
an ongoing basis.''
   Smith said there had not been much progress reported in talks
with the other five nations, and his alliance recommended Turkey
and Malaysia be added to the priority watch list.
   ``She didn't do that, but she did specially warn them that they
have to start dealing with copyright issues,'' Smith said.
   The Special 301 authority allows the administration to negotiate
improvements in copyright protection and market access directly
with other nations or through the 97-nation General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade.

<TEXT>
   Officials at Three Mile Island's nuclear
plant say they will be ready in about a month to begin evaporating
2.3 million gallons of slightly radioactive water left from the
March 1979 accident and cleanup.
   A second stage of testing was scheduled to begin this week and
the water will be pumped into boilers by early December, said Joe
Kuehn, Unit 2 site operations director.
   He and TMI-2 director Michael Roche briefed reporters Wednesday
to show off the $4 million project's equipment.
   ``This is certainly one of the bigger milestones,'' Roche said
of the expected startup.
   Two anti-nuclear groups, Three Mile Island Alert and the
Susquehanna Valley Alliance, have appealed the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission's approval of evaporation to an administrative board and
the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   TMI Unit 2 was damaged on March 28, 1979, during the nation's
worst commercial nuclear power plant accident.
   Water laced with tritium, cesium, strontium, carbon, boron and
sodium will be boiled, distilled, then reboiled; the steam will be
sent through a thin, 100-foot high stack and vented into the air.
   The 5-gallon-a-minute process will remove all but the tritium. A
radiation monitor attached to the system will automatically block
releases if excessive radiation levels are detected in water headed
to the final boiler.
   ``This is not a new technology,'' Kuehn said.
   He said the treated water being boiled this way is much cleaner
than water normally subjected to industrial evaporation.
   Kuehn said the doses from the tritium releases will be no more
than 1.2 millirems for someone who would have to stand at the plant
boundary during the whole evaporation process. People usually
receive about 300 millirems a year from naturally occurring
radiation.
   Six additional tritium monitors have been deployed in areas
around the plant, including one in York, about 10 miles away, he
said.
   He said officials expect the monitors will show levels above
background radiation, but that the average dose for people within
50 miles of the plant would be 0.005 millirem.
   He said the amount of tritium in the 2.3 million gallons of
water is equivalent to about 18 drops.
   Solids left from the evaporation will be mixed with water and
turned into pellets that will be placed in 55-gallon drums and
shipped to a low-level nuclear disposal area in Hanford, Wash. The
evaporation will produce one to two drums of solids a day, or a
total of 5,000 to 10,000 cubic feet.

   Cartoonist Garry Trudeau has sued the Writers
Guild of America for $10 million, claiming the union harassed him
because he refused to participate in a strike against a company he
co-owns.
   The creator of the ``Doonesbury'' comic strip said his
independent television production company, Darkhorse Productions,
was caught up in the union's 1988 strike against the television and
motion picture industry.
   He said the guild did not serve Darkhorse with a 60-day notice
of intent to strike as required by law, and he refused to
participate in what he termed ``the unlawful strike against
Darkhorse.''
   The lawsuit contends the union launched a deliberate campaign to
harass and punish Trudeau, a guild member, for his association with
Darkhorse and his refusal to participate in the strike.
   Marty Waldman, a spokesman for the union, said it would have no
comment until its lawyers reviewed the suit.
   The suit was filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court.

   Federal savings and loan regulator M. Danny
Wall says his congressional critics aren't giving him a fair chance
to respond to charges he mishandled the nation's largest thrift
institution failure.
   ``Fair play clearly has not been evident, much less due
process,'' he said Wednesday in an interview at his office a block
from the White House.
   The House Banking Committee is investigating the collapse of
Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, an Irvine, Calif., thrift
controlled by Phoenix, Ariz., millionaire Charles H. Keating Jr.
   In three hearings, the committee has collected reams of
testimony critical of Wall's handling of the collapse, which is
expected to cost taxpayers between $1.5 billion and $2 billion,
making it the nation's costliest S&amp;L failure.
   Committee aides say the panel will hear from Wall later this
month. But a firm date hasn't been set and Wall said he is
concerned public opinion will harden and Congress may even recess
until next year before he gets a chance to tell his side of the
story.
   ``The public sees silence as being an admission of guilt. ... I
clearly ... will be eager to respond to every question that is
asked,'' Wall said.
   The committee is focusing on why Wall, as chairman of the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board _ now called the Office of Thrift
Supervision _ rejected a 1987 recommendation from his agency's San
Francisco office to take over Lincoln and instead ordered a second
examination, supervised by regulators from Washington, which
delayed the seizure of the institution until this April.
   Michael Patriarca, director of the thrift agency's San Francisco
office, and William K. Black, counsel in the office, told the
committee they had uncovered sufficient losses and irregularities
at Lincoln to justify its seizure two years ago.
   However, Wall said the San Francisco examiners only had enough
information to justify an order restricting some of Lincoln's
activities. The new examination supervised by different regulators
avoided a lawsuit blocking access to records of Lincoln's parent
company, American Continental Corp., he said.
   And the second examination eventually produced the evidence
needed by the government to seize the S&amp;L, Wall said.
   ``It's absolutely crystal clear what would have occurred other
than our having used the approach of a clean set of examiners. We
may have been delayed further,'' he said.
   Wall called Patriarca a ``very competent regulator'' and noted
he had recently reappointed him. But asked why he did not dismiss
him for presenting what he considered one-sided testimony to the
House panel, Wall said, ``We will consider all of what needs to be
considered at an appropriate time.''
   ``I'm not threatening anybody,'' he said. ``I'm clearly not
rushing to judgment just as I don't want anyone to rush to judgment
on me.''
   Patriarca has complained that Wall, without informing examiners
in San Francisco, met with Keating three times. Wall said the
sessions did not influence his thinking, but conceded, ``It's very
difficult to prove the negative.''
   He also said he was unimpressed that Keating was able to
persuade two senators and a member of the House Banking Committee
to intervene on behalf of Lincoln.
   ``I'm not blase about senators, don't misunderstand me,'' Wall
said. ``On the other hand, I'm not impressed by the fact that
someone can talk to X number of senators.''
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., called Wall soon after he began a
four-year term as the nation's top thrift regulator in July 1987,
after leaving a post as chief Republican aide on the Senate Banking
Committee. Cranston was attempting to prod the agency into deciding
whether or not to take action against Lincoln.
   Early this year, Cranston, Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., and
Rep. Carroll Hubbard, D-Ky., called to urge speedy consideration of
Keating's proposal to sell Lincoln, he said.
   Cranston and DeConcini are among five senators who received
large campaign contributions from Keating.
   Wall brushed off a call from the chairman of the House
committee, Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, to step aside, saying
he wanted to see his agency through its reorganization as a wing of
the Treasury Department
   ``I have a job to do here, I believe, and I want to see it
through,'' he said.

<HEAD>Scientists Say Fetal Tissue May Help Fight Diseases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists believe fetal tissue is a promising
source for research into diseases such as Parkinson's and
Alzheimer's and even may help correct the afflictions of unborn
children.
   But there are advocates on the other side who fear that such
research could subtly encourage women to have abortions.
   A ban on using federal money for fetal tissue research was
imposed a year ago, and James Mason, assistant secretary for health
at the Department of Health and Human Services, told reporters
Wednesday he intends to continue it indefinitely.
   ``The problem is the source of fetal tissue, that's the
concern,'' said Dr. Susan Black, a geneticist at Fairfax (Va.)
Hospital, in an interview. ``Of course the tissue would be coming
from abortions. They are afraid people will do this in order just
to have fetal tissue, and that's not the intention at all.''
   She said, for example, that earlier diagnosis of fetal tissues
has much potential for correcting such problems as immune
deficiency at an early stage of pregnancy.
   The question is, she said, ``can you correct that problem and
therefore have an intact fetus in which the options that a parent
might have are not just to not continue that pregnancy _ but to
treat the disease before the baby is born?''
   Fetal tissue has the advantage of being still in the process of
developing and thus able to deliver materials that an older cell no
longer can, said Robert C. Baumiller, director of the Division of
Genetics at Georgetown University.
   ``What the fetal cell does better than any cell from an
individual after birth is to grow,'' he said. ``There are growth
factors present within a fetal human which are unique to that
system, so they have a vitality that is unique.''
   Baumiller said scientists believe it would be a shame not to put
fetuses to some positive use, such as helping victims of
degenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.
   Some experts believe it may be possible to treat a variety of
diseases by transplanting tissue taken from aborted fetuses. There
were especially hopeful signs in use of such tissues in treating
Parkinson's disease.
   ``Because of Parkinson's, we think there might be some advantage
with other neurological degenerative diseases, especially those
with cells which are kind of sister cells,'' said Baumiller. ``The
next question would be, if it helps in Alzheimer's disease, could
it help perhaps in Huntington's, any place where you have a
neurological degenerative condition?''
   Dr. Robert Hay, head of the cell culture department of the
American Type Culture Collection in Rockville, Md., said fetal
cells have provided information on aging and cell transformation _
the change from normal to cancerous properties _ and in virus
replication studies and studies of chemicals that affect human
cells.
   Some argue that there is enough primate research already being
carried out that no one needs human fetal research.
   ``Human cells behave differently than cells from animals,'' said
Hay. ``There are properties of human cells we obviously need to
know about that differ from those of a mouse or a rat.''
   The ethics of using tissue from aborted fetuses were studied
recently by a committee at Stanford University, which drew up
guidelines that include:
   _Women who undergo abortions should not benefit directly from
the medical use of their fetuses. They should not be reimbursed for
their abortions.
   _Medical personnel who perform abortions also should not profit
from use of the fetal tissue.
   _Fetal tissue should be treated with the respect given to
cadavers.
   _Fetuses should not be aborted for the specific purpose of using
their tissue.

<HEAD>OSHA Proposes Biggest Fine Ever in Pennsylvania Steel Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Labor Department is seeking a record $7.3
million fine from USX Corp. for 2,000 alleged safety violations at
two steel plants, including hazards the government says were blamed
for fatalities but not corrected.
   ``The magnitude of these penalties and citations is matched only
by the magnitude of the hazards to workers which resulted from
corporate indifference to worker safety and health,'' Labor
Secretary Elizabeth Dole said Wednesday.
   The department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration
accused USX of permitting some of the violations at the
Pennsylvania plants even though the company agreed two years ago to
eliminate them at all its facilities.
   ``Company managers had known about many of these safety and
health deficiencies at the plants for years, yet have failed to
take necessary action to correct the hazards,'' said Assistant
Labor Secretary Gerard F. Scannell, who heads OSHA.
   USX has 15 working days to contest the citations and fines.
   USX spokesman Thomas Ferrall said company officials would review
the citations before commenting on specifics but denied they
ignored safety concerns.
   ``There is no consideration more important than the health and
safety of our employees,'' Ferrall said in a telephone interview.
``Our commitment to all of our people at all of our plants is to
provide a safe and healthy workplace. We think we are doing that.''
   Ferrall said the company cooperated with OSHA and corrected
safety problems discovered during the investigation.
   But Mike Wright, safety director for the United Steelworkers of
America union, said only some of the problems had been corrected.
   ``We're sorry that it came to this but we think that the
citations are well deserved,'' said Wright. ``The union has had
real problems with both plants for some time. We've got safety
problems at all their plants.''
   The agency accused USX of 1,628 violations at its Fairless Hills
steel mill on the Pennsylvania side of the Delaware River near
Trenton, N.J. and proposed a fine of $6,095,600. That is the
highest fine OSHA has ever proposed for violations at one work site.
   The company was accused of 376 violations at its Clairton Coke
Works near Pittsburgh. OSHA proposed a fine of $1,202,600 for those.
   The alleged violations include failure to provide safe walking
and working surfaces; substandard crane-safety standards; failure
to properly guard machines and power transmission equipment; noise
violations; failure to keep accurate records of injuries and
illnesses; structural flaws; and violations of electrical-safety
standards.
   The citations stem from OSHA inspections that began in May at
the Clairton works, which has 1,500 workers, and in June at
Fairless Works, which employs 4,000. The Steelworkers filed a
complaint that triggered the Clairton inspection; employee
complaints led to the other. OSHA said there have been three worker
fatalities at the two plants in the last two years and 17 since
1972.
   The proposed fines total $7,298,200. The previous record was
$5.1 million against companies involved in a building collapse at
Bridgeport, Conn. The largest for a single company was $4.3 million
against John Morrell Co. two years ago for alleged violations at
meat-packing plants. Both the Bridgeport and Morrell fines are
being contested.
   OSHA often accepts lesser amounts after negotiations with the
companies involved.

   Nicaragua's President Daniel Ortega says in an
article on the Op-Ed page of today's New York Times that President
Bush has blocked all efforts to demobilize and disarm the Contras.
   ``He has kept the Contras intact militarily by continuing to
provide them with non-lethal assistance,'' Ortega writes.
   And, concerning the presidential elections scheduled in
Nicaragua in February, Ortega says:
   ``I shall continue doing everything I can to insure that the
current electoral process remains democratic and that, as in 1984,
our elections are judged free and fair by the international
observers.''
   He said Bush delivered a ``torrent of personal invective''
against him at the meeting of hemispheric leaders in Costa Rica
last week.
   ``He accused me of spoiling the `garden party' in Costa Rica''
by announcing he would end the cease-fire, Ortega said. ``Well,
life in my country is no `garden party,''' he continued. ``Eight
years of war financed and directed by the Reagan and Bush
adminstrations have seen to that.''
   Ortega defended his decision to cancel the cease-fire, saying
the Contras had stepped-up their military activity, threatening the
election process.
   The only way to achieve peace in Nicaragua is to disband the
U.S.-supported rebels, he wrote.
   ``We do not consider it an acceptable cease-fire when we cease
and the Contras fire,'' he said.

   Sen. Orrin Hatch says if the federal
government can give money to residents of Pacific islands affected
by atomic testing, there's no good reason not to do the same for
residents of western states.
   Hatch and Rep. Wayne Owens, both of Utah, called Wednesday for a
House panel to set up a $100 million trust fund for what Owens
called the nation's ``forgotten guinea pigs'' in the development of
nuclear weapons.
   The Republican senator and Democratic congressman have teamed up
on similar measures before but have never been able to get
legislation out of committee.
   They are more optimistic this year, pointing out Congress
created a special fund for Japanese people who were locked in U.S.
camps during World War II and also voted assistance for veterans
exposed to atomic radiation while on duty.
   Several civilians exposed to fallout from the Nevada Test Site
during the 1950s have won judgments in federal courts only to have
them overturned on appeal because of a federal law that generally
shields the government from lawsuits.
   The House Judiciary subcommittee on administrative law and
government relations is considering broader legislation that would
expand the right to sue the federal government if negligence can be
proved.
   But there was no indication how soon the panel will act on that
or the one-purpose, Hatch-Owens bill.
   Hatch said the Senate made history in 1985 by acknowledging in
its approval of the Marshall Island Compact that atomic testing
fallout damaged the health of Pacific islanders and by authorizing
payments for the residents.
   Hatch said he fell eight votes short at the time of winning
similar treatment for residents of the United States.
   Called ``downwinders,'' the people exposed to fallout from open
air nuclear testing in Nevada in the 1950s live mainly in southern
Nevada, southern Utah and northwestern Arizona.
   Hatch said the trust fund he is proposing would ``amount to only
a fraction of what the downwinders and miners have spent because of
the problems that the government has caused.''
   He said the cases of those who mined uranium in Colorado, New
Mexico, Arizona and Utah from 1947 to 1961 may be even more
appalling.
   ``Even though the government had adequate warning of the hazards
involved, these miners, most of whom were native Americans, were
sent into inadequately ventilated mines with virtually no
instruction regarding the dangers of ionizing radiation,'' he said.
   Owens called the mining and testing as ``an unnoticed part of
this nation's nuclear Cold War with the Soviets.''
   ``The residents of this region were used as `guinea pigs' in a
deadly experiment,'' he said.
   He noted a House subcommittee concluded a decade ago
``sufficient evidence exists for the federal government to accept
at least compassionate responsibility.''
   ``Then, after wringing its hands over the suffering of these
forgotten guinea pigs, Congress unfortunately forgot again,'' said
Owens, who said his brother-in-law, a former uranium miner,
recently died of lung cancer.
   Assistant Attorney General Stuart M. Gerson, head of the Justice
Department's civil division, said the administration opposes the
legislation ``because it would dramatically change current law by
making the United States subject to unprecedented liability for
implementing policy decisions and functions.''

<HEAD>Dollar Up In Tokyo, Stocks Decline</HEAD>

   The dollar gained strength against the Japanese yen
today, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange declined.
   The dollar closed at 143.75 yen, up 0.67 yen from Wednesday's
143.08-yen finish. It opened higher at 143.93 yen and ranged
between 143.65 yen and 144.15 yen.
   The U.S. currency's higher opening in Tokyo followed a similar
uptrend on overseas markets overnight, traders said.
   ``But the dollar didn't rise much after surpassing the 144-yen
mark, when the majority of market players became cautious about
buying ahead of the (release of) the U.S. jobless rate report and a
three-day-weekend,'' said Masafumi Koyama, a Bank of Tokyo trader.
   ``Japanese investors wanted to figure out whether the dollar was
in a continuous uptrend or its recent strength has been just a
temporary movement,'' he said.
   Japanese financial markets will be closed for Culture Day, a
national holiday, Friday.
   On the stock exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost
69.57 points, or 0.20 percent, closing at 35,494.86. It gained
14.99 points Wednesday.
   The index, which lost 139.93 points at the end of morning
trading, erased some of its early losses in the afternoon on
bargain hunting, dealers said.
   ``The yen's weakness largely discouraged investors,'' said
Masahiro Umemori, a Nomura Securities Co. analyst.
   Many investors remained on the sidelines awaiting the U.S.
jobless figures, he said.
   Trading was moderate, with an estimated 800 million shares
changing hands, down from Wednesday's 900 million.

<HEAD>Soviets Appear to be Fulfilling Eastern Europe Pledge, Aspin Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee says Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev appears to be
carrying out his pledge to make sizeable cuts in Soviet forces in
Eastern Europe.
   But Rep. Les. Aspin, D-Wis., added that Soviet forces have also
increased artillery strength in Eastern Europe. Gorbachev has said
8,500 artillery pieces would be cut from eastern Europe and
adjacent Soviet territory.
   It is still not certain Gorbachev will fulfill a promise to
reduce Soviet troops overall by half a million men, Aspin said
Wednesday night.
   ``We don't see that yet,'' Aspin said at the Carnegie Endowment
for International Peace, a private research group. ``It's just hard
for us to understand when they will do that.''
   Gorbachev, in a speech last December at the United Nations,
promised to withdraw six tank divisions from East Germany,
Czechoslovakia, and Hungary within two years and reduce Soviet
forces in the Warsaw Pact countries by 50,000 men.
   He said the Soviet Union would also reduce the overall size of
its armed forces by 500,000 men.
   ``A lot of unanswered questions remain about the force
reductions west of the Urals (within Soviet territory). But the
rest of the reductions seem to be taking place,'' Aspin said.
   Aspin said three of the six tank divisions have been withdrawn
from eastern Europe and ``a big chunk'' of the troops left with
them.
   He said the pullout contradicts ``the general impression that
we're still waiting for something to happen.''
   However, Aspin said, the Soviets have also increased their other
military vehicles in Eastern Europe by about 20 percent and were
adding more than 1,000 artillery pieces, or a boost of about 15
percent.
   ``The net result of all of that is that the capability of their
forces in Eastern Europe would be reduced on the order of 20
percent'' by December 1990. ``That's on track and irreversible,''
he said.
   Aspin and other members of the Armed Services Committee went on
a two-week trip to the Soviet Union and East Germany in August.
   ``He's halfway delivered in half of the time,'' Aspin said of
Gorbachev, who will meet with President Bush in a summit meeting
off the Mediterranean island of Malta Dec. 2-3.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of States James A. Baker III,
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and other administration officials
arrived today as part of the most senior U.S. delegation to visit
Australia in more than 20 years.
   The officials arrived for annual talks and for a 12-nation
conference that could put the Asia-Pacific region on a new economic
footing.
   Other members of the U.S. group included Commerce Secretary
Robert A. Mosbacher and trade representative Carla Hills.
   ``It's the greatest conglomeration of U.S. Cabinet ministers
ever (here),'' said an Australian official.
   U.S. officials said it was the highest-ranking delegation since
President Lyndon B. Johnson visited in 1967 for the funeral of
Prime Minister Harold Holt.
   This year's talks replace the annual ANZUS treaty consultations,
which included New Zealand until that country adopted an
anti-nuclear policy in 1984 that caused a major rift in its
relations with the United States.
   ANZUS takes its name from treaty partners Australia, New Zealand
and the United States. New Zealand, while still a member, no longer
operates as a functioning partner.
   Australian officials said the bilateral talks likely would be
overshadowed by the Nov. 5-7 Asia Pacific Economic Conference, but
welcomed the opportunity for the first time to discuss world
affairs with members of the Bush administration.
   They said the talks were a chance for Australia to learn
first-hand the U.S. view of developments in the East bloc, in China
and in disarmament.
   Cheney and Hardisty were visiting for the bilateral meeting
alone, while Mosbacher and Mrs. Hills were heading straight to
Canberra, the federal capital, for the APEC meeting, which includes
representatives from the six ASEAN nations and Australia, New
Zealand, Canada, Japan and South Korea.

<TEXT>
   A gay account executive who won a
week-long, company-paid vacation for two in Hawaii has settled a
discriminatory complaint against his company, which would not allow
him to take his male lover.
   ``This settlement is another important step in the growing
movement for equal recognition of lesbian and gay couples,''
attorney William B. Rubenstein, of the American Civil Liberties
Union's Lesbian and Gay Rights Project, said in a statement.
   Jeffrey Donohoe, 29, won the trip based on his company's sales
quota in 1987. The company offered to pay for his wife or female
friend to accompany him, but refused to pay for his male ``life
partner'' with whom he had lived since 1984.
   ``I certainly thought it was very unfair and discriminatory,''
said Donohoe, who filed a complaint with the county's Human
Relations Commission.
   Last week, Donohoe's employer agreed to change its policy to
allow his friend to join him on company-paid vacations and to pay
Donohoe an undisclosed sum of cash. Gay rights advocates said the
settlement carries symbolic weight.
   The settlement, overseen by the Montgomery County Human
Relations Commission, prohibits those involved from disclosing the
name of the company or the amount of money it paid Donohoe. The
employer, described as a nationwide company, avoided a public
hearing on its apparent violation of the county's
anti-discrimination law, according to the ACLU, which represented
Donohoe.
   Rubenstein noted that the settlement followed two other, more
significant victories for gay rights advocates this year.
   In July, New York's highest court ruled that a homosexual couple
must be considered a ``family'' for the purposes of New York City's
rent control law. Also, San Francisco passed a law giving unmarried
heterosexual and gay couples the same housing and hospital
visitation rights as married partners.
   The Montgomery County case ``is not of the same magnitude,''
said Nan Hunter, head of the Lesbian and Gay Rights Project. ``It's
part of a trend. More and more private employers and agencies are
taking steps, and will be forced to take steps, to equalize
benefits.''
   Elizabeth Symonds, another ACLU lawyer involved with the case,
said the settlement only applies to the company's Montgomery County
office.

<HEAD>Researchers Boost Superconductor Ability to Carry Current</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers said today they have greatly
improved the ability of a crystal of superconducting material to
carry electrical power by an odd-sounding strategy: They made
defects in its structure.
   The result boosts hopes for making practical use of the recently
discovered class of compounds called high-temperature
superconductors, scientists said.
   The study indicates that a solution is possible for one of two
key obstacles to making the materials carry useful amounts of
current, said co-author Robert B. van Dover.
   Superconductors are materials that carry electricity without
resistance. All those discovered so far must be chilled to work.
   In recent years, scientists have created the high-temperature
superconductors, so called because they require less chilling than
previously known materials. Scientists hope these compounds will
have more uses than the previous materials.
   Researchers want to use these new materials in such applications
as high-power magnets, floating high-speed trains and devices for
storing electrical power.
   The new study addressed a barrier to such uses: In a magnetic
field, bulk samples of high-temperature superconductor have been
able to carry only small levels of electrical current without
losing superconducting ability.
   The researchers bombarded a crystal of superconducting material
with neutrons, tiny particles that make up parts of atoms. The
crystal could then carry about 100 times the current that untreated
crystals could without losing superconductivity, they found.
   The neutron bombardment created structural defects within the
crystal, the researchers said.
   These defects hampered the movement of tiny areas of magnetic
field within the crystal. Movement of such magnetic fields causes
electrical resistance, spoiling the performance of the
superconductor.
   The performance of the bombarded crystal represents about a
50-fold improvement over what other researchers have attained with
single crystals of bulk superconductor, van Dover said in a
telephone interview.
   It is comparable to the performance of extremely thin films of
superconducting material, said David Welch of Brookhaven National
Laboratory on Long Island. Thin films, however, are not practical
for making magnets and other relatively large-scale uses, he said.
   The crystal study is presented in today's issue of the British
journal Nature by van Dover, Lynn Schneemeyer, E.M. Gyrogy and
others at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, N.J., and
scientists in Sweden.
   The work does not address a second crucial obstacle for bulk
superconductors: loss of current-carrying capacity that occurs
between crystals in a sample. ``That problem is still out there,''
van Dover said.
   In addition, he said, researchers would like to come up with a
more practical method than neutron bombardment for creating
improved superconductors, he said.
   Nonetheless, the work is encouraging for efforts to overcome
current-carrying limits within crystals. ``It certainly indicates
it is possible,'' said Welch.
   Brian Maple of the University of California, San Diego, called
the study ``an important step'' toward solving the overall problem
of low current capacity in bulk superconductors.
   The experiments involved crystals containing the standard
superconductor ingredients of yttrium, barium, copper and oxygen.
   The neutron-irradiated crystal achieved a ``critical current
density'' of about 600,000 amperes per square centimeter, when
chilled to minus 321 degrees Fahrenheit and exposed to a magnetic
field about 18,000 times that of Earth.
   Other researchers had previously reported improving
superconductor performance by creating structural defects, but they
did not produce as dramatic an improvement, Maple said.

   Rumors of planned satanic cult sacrifices of

   Attendance was back to normal Wednesday.
   ``This morning I think a lot of people are looking back and are

   Carter said a rumor apparently started in nearby Fort Valley,
where many Butler residents work, that 12 black cats had been
sacrificed on the Butler town square.
   ``And from there it just got out of hand,'' Carter said, until
the rumor grew to include plans for kidnapping and sacrificing
children on Halloween.
   He said about 175 parents kept their children out of the
elementary school Tuesday _ about one-fourth of the school's
students. While the school administration discounted the rumors, he
said, security was increased as a precaution.

   The Department of Housing and Urban
Development has concluded that the former acting administrator of
HUD's New York regional office violated the agency's standards of
conduct by voting on HUD programs as a trustee of Island Park, N.Y.
   The internal case against Geraldine McGann has been closed and
she has been reassigned to a lower-level job at HUD headquarters in
Washington, according to a HUD audit and other documents obtained
under the Freedom of Information Act.
   HUD spokesman Jack Flynn said Wednesday that McGann continues to
be paid the same salary she made as regional administrator, $68,500
a year.
   The internal investigation of McGann stemmed from her dual role
as a HUD employee and a trustee of the village of Island Park, Long
Island. Minutes of the Island Park board meetings indicated that
McGann voted on HUD-related resolutions from 1982 to 1989, a
violation of HUD's code of conduct.

parts of the sets may pose a potential choking hazard for young
children.
   Toys `R' Us is recalling 15,000 Crib Pals ``Play Shapes'' sets
because the small shapes fail to meet the Consumer Product Safety
Commission's mandatory standard for baby rattles, the commission
said Wednesday.
   The sets are imported from Taiwan and marked SKN 157198. They
contain four plastic pieces _ one is a circle with a ball that
rattles _ in different shapes and colors.
   The play sets, which were sold nationwide for ages 1 and up
during 1988 and 1989, are considered a rattle and must satisfy a
more stringent choking standard than items classified as toys.

<HEAD>Bush to Give Occasional Radio Interviews</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush will start giving occasional
interviews to radio reporters, the White House says.
   Bush intends to give the radio interviews on Friday afternoons,
but it will be up to the participating outlet when the broadcast
airs, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Wednesday.
   It will be ``not every week, but occasionally,'' he added.
   The interviews will be with radio reporters who regularly cover
the White House, Fitzwater said.
   Bush has given numerous one-on-one interviews with newspapers in
his first 10 months in office, but had not made a habit of granting
radio interviews.

<HEAD>Coleman Challenges Wilder to Showdown at Capitol</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   L. Douglas Wilder, vying to become the
nation's first black elected governor, and opponent J. Marshall
Coleman began an intense new round of character attacks less than a
week before the gubernatorial election.
   Wilder, a Democrat and the state's lieutenant governor, released
a television commercial Wednesday accusing Coleman, a Republican
former attorney general, of ``not telling the truth'' about
abortion, a key issue in the race.
   Coleman, who trailed Wilder by 15 percentage points in a recent
poll, challenged Wilder to a showdown at the Capitol today to
explain why he ``directly and shamelessly'' misled voters about his
position on a state law banning compulsory union membership.
   The candidates have raised questions throughout the campaign
about each other's fitness for office, but both were more pointed
in the latest exchange. Wilder's TV advertisement shows a portion
of a Coleman ad that began airing Tuesday, a week before the
election. In the portion of the ad, Coleman says, ``Let's set the
record straight. I'm not going to restrict abortions for rape or
incest.''
   The Wilder ad goes on to say that Coleman, an abortion opponent
except to save the life of the mother, has long campaigned on a
pledge to ban the procedure and repeated the promise earlier this
year in a letter to a group of clergymen.
   ``Marshall Coleman is not telling the truth about abortion,''
Wilder's ad says. ``That's why we just can't trust Marshall
Coleman.''
   In a letter, Coleman challenged Wilder to show up this afternoon
at the Capitol to listen to a tape recording of a private meeting
between Wilder and United Mine Workers.
   At the July 31 meeting, Wilder said he supported a
``free-rider'' amendment to Virginia's right-to-work law. The law
forbids labor contracts requiring workers to join a union, but the
amendment could force non-union employees to pay dues to unions
that negotiate agreements for them.
   Coleman contends the amendment would gut the right-to-work law.
He wrote Wilder that he would play the tape for reporters today
whether Wilder showed up or not.
   ``Either way, the people of Virginia are going to know how
directly and shamelessly you tried to deceive them,'' Coleman wrote.
   B.J. Northington, Wilder's deputy press secretary, said Wilder
had no plans to meet Coleman at the Capitol.
   ``It's just another negative attack,'' Ms. Northington said.
   Wilder, at a meeting with Richmond business leaders, pledged to
keep the right-to-work law ``as it is'' and to veto any effort to
weaken it.
   ``I don't go one place and say one thing and another place and
say another,'' Wilder said. He said the remark at the UMW meeting
did not contradict his position of support for the law _ and he
said that support left the miners ``very upset with me.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With less than a week to go before the mayoral
election, Democrat David Dinkins and Republican Rudolph Giuliani
have agreed to face each other in at least two televised
appearances.
   The appearances, one of which is billed as a debate, were
announced Wednesday and include a third, lesser-known candidate
whose participation Dinkins had insisted upon.
   While the candidates were negotiating on other possible joint
appearances, a poll of registered voters published in New York
Newsday today showed Dinkins leads Giuliani by 11 points _ 49-38
percent.
   Another poll showed Dinkins was favored over the former U.S.
attorney 47-34 percent. The survey was released by Barry Feinstein,
Teamsters Local 237 president and a strong Dinkins backer.
   Giuliani's consent to let Right to Life candidate Henry Hewes
join in the debate marked a victory for Dinkins, who had insisted
that all candidates be allowed to participate in a debate if they
chose.
   The decision by the Giuliani campaign to allow the inclusion of
other candidates came after a debate Wednesday in which Dinkins and
Hewes participated. Giuliani was represented on the stage by an
empty chair.
   Asked why he had changed his mind, Giuliani said:
   ``In order to make certain that these issues got out before the
public, we're going to do it on his terms. And, we're going to
show, even on his terms, that this man is not qualified to be mayor
of this city.''
   Also today, Giuliani picked up an endorsement from the New York
Post, in an editorial in today's editions. Dinkins was endorsed
Wednesday by Newsday and The Village Voice.

   A state senator heavily favored to
become this city's first black mayor is battling voter complacency
rather than his tough-talking opponent as he strives to fulfill a
20-year-old dream.
   Sen. John Daniels said his easy victory in the Democratic
primary, over a candidate who had won the party's endorsement,
electrified his supporters but also left many with the mistaken
impression that the race was over.
   ``I was out in a neighborhood the other day and when I knocked
on the door, a woman answered, `Senator Daniels, you again? Didn't
we just vote you into office? We have to do that again?'
   ``A lot of people think I'm already the mayor. There is a lot of
apathy out there,'' Daniels said in a recent interview as his
campaign staff prepared for a final get-out-the-vote push.
   Apathy was not a problem on primary day, when 53 percent of the
city's registered Democrats voted, the highest turnout in 10 years.
Daniels scored well in all but a few wards to defeat former city
administrator John DeStefano in the race to succeed retiring
five-term Mayor Biagio DiLieto.
   Democrats outnumber Republicans by nearly 10-to-1 in this city
of 127,000, where blacks make up about 35 percent and Hispanics
about 12 percent of the population.
   Daniels, 53, is a five-term state senator and former city
alderman with a majority interest in a New Haven plumbing business.
A former high school football standout who went to Villanova on an
athletic scholarship, he is still active in sports as a college
football referee.
   His Republican opponent is Alderwoman Robie Pooley, who says the
senator is more interested in making history as the first black
mayor of Connecticut's third largest city than in committing
himself to working full time in the job.
   When Daniels suggested early on that he might want to hold on to
his Senate seat while serving as mayor _ only to learn later that
it was not legally possible _ he showed he did not appreciate the
``the totality of the job,'' she said.
   Daniels said he will retain his financial stake in the plumbing
company but will not work at the business. He has no intention of
giving up his job as a referee, which requires him to work 10 games
a year.
   ``It doesn't interfere with my governing the city,'' he said,
adding, ``some mayors go out and play golf every day.''

<HEAD>Harassment Continues Outside U.S. Embassy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Embassy has issued its fourth protest in
a week over a massive Chinese police presence outside its compound
and the harassment by guards of staff and visitors, an embassy
source said today.
   Also today, China said the visit of former President Nixon will
help restore badly strained relations with the United States, but
insisted again that the blame for the strain lies with Washington.
   The embassy source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
latest verbal protest came Wednesday, hours before another night of
provocations outside Ambassador James Lilley's residence.
   On Wednesday night, about two dozen uniformed police and at
least 10 plainclothes police congregated outside the gate to the
residence, shining a spotlight and forcing visitors to go through a
gauntlet of armed guards.
   Another 20 policemen were posted on nearby streetcorners and
along the street in front of the compound, turning some cars away
and forcing those going to the embassy to park hundreds of yards
away even though there were many empty spaces near the gate.
   When visitors tried to park closer to the embassy, police banged
on their cars and yelled at them to leave.
   Police cursed at a CBS crew that tried to film them, and shined
another spotlight into the crew's camera.
   A similar massing of police occurred Tuesday evening, only then
they were armed with automatic rifles and did not carry spotlights.
   In an apparent gesture to Nixon, the People's Armed Police
around the three American embassy compounds did not carry rifles
Wednesday for the first time in four months.
   Nixon aides said the former president told Premier Li Peng he
did not like guns and did not want to see rifle-toting guards when
he visited the embassy.
   Today, guards continued to wear pistols, and eight black or gray
Mercedes, some without license plates, were again parked along the
street outside the ambassador's residence with men, apparently
plainclothes police, seated inside.
   The embassy also has complained of three cases of embassy staff
finding their car tires slashed and security forces tailing embassy
employees as they left the compounds.
   Twice in the past week, armed police outside the embassy pointed
their automatic rifles at children of U.S. diplomats and pulled the
trigger, an embassy source said. The guns were not loaded.
   The only unusual event at the embassy recently was a Halloween
party last Saturday, where the arrival of people wearing costumes
apparently rattled the Chinese.
   At least 80 police were called in, seemingly to block Chinese
fugitives from sneaking into embassy grounds. Police became
particularly upset when partygoers arrived carrying a fake coffin.
   One man who came to the party dressed in a gorilla suit was told
to park his car elsewhere.
   Premier Li reportedly told Nixon that the heavy guard _ most
embassies have only one or two Chinese police posted outside _ was
necessary to prevent the escape of dissidents Fang Lizhi and his
wife Li Shuxian, who took refuge in the embassy after the June 4
military crackdown on the pro-democracy movement.
   Fang and Li, wanted by Chinese police as counterrevolutionary
agitators, remain in one of the embassy compounds.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing, asked about the police
harassment at a weekly briefing today, said China ``always attached
importance to the safety of the foreign embassies in China.''
   Li said Nixon's five-day visit, which ended several before the
briefing, ``will undoubtedly be conducive to the restoration and
development of the normal relations.''
   But he said ``it is imperative for the United States, and
actually the United States only, to take the initiative'' in
improving ties.
   Washington cut off high-level contacts with Beijing after the
crackdown, when Chinese troops killed hundreds of unarmed
civilians. It has urged China to end repression against those who
advocate democratic reform.
   Nixon aides said the former president will present a written
account of his private visit to President Bush.

<HEAD>Misplaced Note Led to Murder Charge Against Methodist Pastor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ELLAVILLE, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A preacher admitted killing his first wife
when police questioned him about a crumpled note allegedly
describing plans to kill his second wife, authorities said.
   James P. Chastain was arrested after his wife, Luanne Chastain,
found the note in their bedroom. It contained notes on how he
planned to kill his wife, an ordained minister, said Georgia Bureau
of Investigation agent Ed Ricks.
   She alerted authorities who arrested her husband and charged him
with burglary and arson in a fire Oct. 13 at his sister-in-law's
house.
   Then Colquitt County Sheriff Billy Howell began questioning him
about a 1979 mobile home fire in which Teresa Chastain died.
   ``He owned up to it. He said his wife was asleep in the trailer
when he set fire to it,'' Howell said.
   Chastain was charged Oct. 24 with murder in his first wife's
death.
   Teresa Chastain was planning to leave her husband after four
years of marriage when she died in the fire, said her sister Doris
Griffin. The fire had been ruled accidental.
   Chastain served four months in prison for breaking into a
neighbor's mobile home and stealing a gun in 1982.
   ``When he went to prison, he said he found Jesus,'' said his
mother, Beatrice Chastain of Moultrie.
   He entered the United Methodist ministry in 1984.
   As an unordained lay minister, he served as pastor of small
congregations in southern Georgia, usually three or four at a time.
   His wife, an ordained United Methodist minister, was pastor of
Berlin and Wesley Chapel churches in southern Colquitt County.
   ``When they first came here, he spoke to the men's club and said
he had served time in prison,'' said Jeanette Layfield of the
Kimball United Methodist Church, where Mrs. Chastain was the pastor
for a time. ``He also told them about having his wife die in a
fire.''
   He met his second wife in 1984 when she was suffering from a
back injury and she asked him to preach for her at a church where
she was pastor.

<HEAD>Widow of Utility Executive Files Wrongful Death Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The widow of a Gulf Power Co. executive
killed in a mysterious plane crash has filed a wrongful death
lawsuit against a related company that owned the aircraft.
   Frances W. Horton filed the suit against Southern Company
Services Inc. on Wednesday, a day after Gulf Power pleaded guilty
to federal charges of conspiring to make illegal political
contributions.
   Gulf Power officials and federal prosecutors said the
contributions were arranged by her husband, Jacob ``Jake'' Horton,
the utility's senior vice president.
   The defendant company and Gulf Power are subsidiaries of the
Atlanta-based Southern Co.
   Horton died April 10 in the crash that also killed two Southern
Company pilots from Mississippi within minutes after it took off
from Pensacola Regional Airport en route to Atlanta.
   The suit alleges that Southern Company and the pilots were
negligent in maintaining and operating the aircraft.
   The crash's cause officially remains under investigation, but
the National Transportation Safety Board has determined a fire
broke out in the cabin before the crash.
   The suit alleges the fire resulted from negligent maintenance
and operation of the airplane and directly contributed to the crash.
   The pilots allegedly failed to properly respond to the fire and
lost control of the plane, causing the crash, according to the suit.
   Federal investigators say they have reached no conclusions on
the causes of either the fire or the crash.
   No dollar amount is specified in the suit, but it demands
compensation for the Mrs. Horton's loss of her husband's support,
services, compansionship and protection, funeral costs and her
mental pain and suffering.
   Horton was told that a Gulf Power audit committee had
recommended his dismissal just hours before the crash. Before
boarding the plane, Horton told his lawyer that he thought he was a
target of a federal grand jury in Atlanta that was investigating
Gulf Power.
   Gulf Power also pleaded guilty to impeding the Internal Revenue
Service and paid a $500,000 fine as part of a plea bargain. The
pleas were entered in U.S. District Court in Atlanta.
   Utility officials and federal prosecutors said that Horton
orchestrated the scheme in which Gulf Power vendors would make
contributions to politicians and submit phony invoices to the
utility to obtain the money.
   However, an attorney who previously represented Gulf Power,
accused the utility and the federal government of using Horton as a
scapegoat.
   Fred Levin, a lawyer in Pensacola, said the plea agreement was a
gutless move designed to justify a costly federal investigation and
to draw attention from the utility onto the deceased executive.
   ``There's no question he (Horton) is taking the blame,'' Levin
said. ``He has no choice because he can't talk back.''
   Carter Haynes, a Gulf Power spokesman, expressed surprise at
Levin's reaction. And U.S. Attorney Robert L. Barr Jr. of Atlanta
said Horton was not being blamed unjustly, saying the government
had a substantial amount of evidence against him.

   An arctic air mass left snow and subzero wind chill readings
today as it crossed from the northern Plains into the southern
Plains.
   Temperatures were in the 60s and 70s ahead of the cold front on
Wednesday; behind it, readings were in the teens this morning.
Northerly winds gusting to 40 mph ushered cold air into Texas.
   Light snow and flurries continued today in parts of North
Dakota, Minnesota and Wisconsin. Strong northerly winds continued
to send cold air into the central Plains region and the middle
Mississippi Valley.
   Showers and thunderstorms were in southeastern Texas and also
extended across southern Louisiana into southern Mississippi.
   Southern California and western Arizona had strong and gusty
winds. A wind advisory was posted for today for the mountains of
Southern California and for areas below Cajon Pass.
   High temperatures Wednesday were mostly in the 30s from the
northern and central Rocky Mountain region to the upper Mississippi
Valley and remained below freezing across North Dakota.
   Temperatures warmed above 70 degrees in the southern Atlantic
Coast region, with 80s in much of Florida. It warmed above 70
degrees across most of California and southern Arizona, with 80s in
southern California and southwest Arizona.
   The nation's high Wednesday was 88 at Fort Myers, Fla., Miami

   An eight-year study that followed more than
13,000 people shows that physical activity significantly reduces
the risk of death from virtually all causes, including heart
disease and cancer, researchers say.
   While the risk of death was lowest among those who were the most
active, the study's authors say that even a slight increase in
activity may reduce death rates among the least fit.
   ``Moderate levels of physical fitness that are attainable by
most adults appear to be protective against early mortality,'' say
the authors of the study, to be published in Friday's Journal of
the American Medical Association.
   The study by Steven N. Blair and others at the Institute for
Aerobics Research in Dallas indicated that if all the unfit people
surveyed had taken measures to become fit, death rates would have
been reduced by 9 percent in men and 15.3 percent in women.
   The researchers studied 10,224 men and 3,120 women for an
average of more than eight years. Of those, 240 men and 43 women
died during the study.
   The subjects were first tested on a treadmill to determine their
fitness level and then tested for cholesterol, blood pressure and
other general health factors. They also were questioned about
relevant life-style factors such as smoking as well as family
history of heart disease.
   Even when all other data were factored in, the more active
groups had lower death rates, the authors said.
   Among men who were the least fit, the death rate was 64 per
10,000 person-years compared with 16.6 deaths among the most fit
group. A person-year equals the number of people studied multiplied
by the number of years they were followed.
   Among women, deaths dropped from 39.5 per 10,000 person-years to
8.5 per 10,000.
   Heart-disease death rates among men fell from 24.6 among the
least fit to 3.1 for those in the two most fit groups. For women,
heart-disease death rates dropped from 7.4 to 0.8.
   Death rates from cancer among men fell from 20.3 to 4.7, and
among women dropped from 16.3 to 1.0.
   ``Approximately 30 percent of U.S. adults are quite sedentary,
and the prevalence of low fitness levels is correspondingly high,''
the authors wrote. ``A brisk walk of 30 to 60 minutes each day will
be sufficient'' to achieve fitness and reduce the risk of death
from heart disease and cancer.
   An accompanying editorial by Dr. Jeffrey Koplan and others at
the federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta urged schools
and doctors to encourage Americans to become more active.
   ``Increased physical activity leads to improved physical fitness
and to other physiological changes,'' he wrote. ``It is the
combination of these changes that leads to improved health.''

<TEXT>
   Authorities said they arrested the
leader of a ring that smuggled 60 tons of cocaine into the United
States during the past year, including a record 21 tons seized near
Los Angeles.
   At least 50 federal police officers stormed a downtown motel
Wednesday and arrested Rafael Munoz Talavera. But a half-hour after
later, his attorneys served federal officials with a court order
restraining police action against their client.
   Federal prosecutor Rolando Aguilera said the order required that
authorities release Munoz, who lives in this border city, by this
afternoon unless he is formally charged with a crime.
   On Sept. 28, U.S. officials seized 21.4 tons of cocaine at a
suburban Los Angeles warehouse in what authorities called the
world's largest cocaine seizure ever. Officials also raided six
warehouses in El Paso, Texas, believed to have been a staging area
for the cocaine.
   Six men have been arrested in the United States in connection
with the case and all have pleaded innocent to drug charges. One of
the six identified Munoz as the mastermind of the smuggling
operation, authorities said.
   Munoz had been hiding out three days at Motel Colonial Las
Fuentes, federal police said.
   According to the court order, the suspect's relatives claim that
Juarez police were about to fly Munoz to Mexico City for
prosecution.
   The order blocked such action, Aguilera said.
   Earlier this week, Mexican officials seized Restaurant Florida,
a popular restaurant in Ciudad Juarez owned by Munoz.

<HEAD>Dollar Steady, Gold Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was steady against most major foreign
currencies in quiet European trading today and dealers said they
expect little movement before Friday's release of the latest U.S.
unemployment figures.
   Gold prices were higher.
   Dealers said the market is looking to October's unemployment
data for additional clues about the strength of the U.S. economy.
   ``If the data show the economy is sluggish, we can see some
activity,'' said one trader in Rome.
   Traders said the dollar was holding steady despite reports that
the Bank of Japan sold dollars, presumably about $100 million, when
the U.S. currency was trading around 143.85 yen.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 0.67 yen to a closing 143.75 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at a lower rate of 143.39 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Wednesday:
   _1.8475 West German marks, up from 1.8377
   _1.6210 Swiss francs, down from 1.6132
   _6.2675 French francs, up from 6.2305
   _2.0867 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0790
   _1,355.00 Italian lire, up from 1,348.50
   _$1.1725 Canadian, down from $1.1742
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.5662 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.5815 late Wednesday.
Dealers said the pound fell on reports that a senior member of the
government was involved in insider trading.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $373.60 a troy ounce,
down from late Wednesday's $374.25. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a higher recommended price of $373.85.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $373.65, up from $373.40 late
Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $.12 to close at a bid $374.04.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.17 a troy
ounce, down from Wednesday's $5.18.

<HEAD>`Sid Caesar &amp; Company' Opens on Broadway</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS four grafs on critics' reviews; no PMs planned.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Sid Caesar &amp; Company: Does Anybody Know What
I'm Talking About,'' a Broadway revue starring the legendary
television comedian, is mostly Caesar but not much company.
   The show is a collection of hit-and-miss sketches that look and
sound as if they would play better on a 10-inch Philco than at the
Golden Theater _ which is where the revue opened Wednesday night.
   The skits, uncredited in the program, are designed to show off
Caesar's unique talent at mime, mimicry and general comic lunacy.
Occasionally, they succeed.
   It's fun to watch Caesar portray a gum machine that evolves into
a slot machine and eventually is demoted to a towel machine in a
men's room. He also does a pretty fair impersonation of a baby,
complete with whines, tantrums, coos and burps.
   He's dandy at playing a mortally wounded Jewish matador in a
scene reminiscent of his big dying number, ``Goodbye,'' in the
musical ``Little Me.'' But there is no overall form to the evening.
At the beginning of the show, Caesar, looking remarkably relaxed
and fit, announces that his favorite type of comedy is rooted in
truth. The ``truths'' that follow meander from obvious jokes about
a man's thoughts as he walks down the aisle on his wedding day to
an overlong argument between husband and wife mimed to the first
movement of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.
   Caesar also resurrects his German professor, who spritzes the
audience with double talk and a variety of accents, dialects and
languages. He plays the same love scene in German, Italian and
Japanese. And the results are equally hilarious.
   The large supporting cast _ seven players in all _ has little to
do except occupy the stage during Caesar's brief costume changes.
Director Martin Charnin injects a little fizz into their interludes
by giving them some peppy but nondescript revue tunes to cover up
Caesar's brief absences.
   The production designs by Neil Peter Jampolis are meager and
unnecessary, looking as if they were an afterthought, added only to
spruce up the show for its move to Broadway after a run of several
months at a Greenwich Village nightclub.
   Caesar has not had much luck on Broadway during his long career.
``Little Me'' was a wonderful show with a terrific score by Cy
Coleman and Carolyn Leigh, but it ran only about six months. His
last appearance on Broadway was in the flop comedy ``Four on a
Garden'' in 1971. The man has always been better than his material.
   You are better off renting a videotape of ``Ten from `Your Show
of Shows,''' a collection of his best television sketches with
Imogene Coca, Carl Reiner and Howard Morris. On Broadway, the
mighty Caesar is again in a mouse of a show.
   In other reviews, critics generally praised Caesar but rejected
the show's length and attempt at being a review.
   The New York Times' Frank Rich said Caesar was in fine form but
there was ``good reason to worry about his show, for it is so
misconceived that it turns the guest of honor into a beggar at his
own feast.''
   Leo Seligsohn of New York Newsday said ``although the show makes
for and uneven evening, when it's good, it's very, very good.''
   Don Nelson of the Daily News called the show ``uneven,'' and
despite a solid supporting cast, ``disappointing.'' The New York
Post's Clive Barnes was more charitable, saying Caesar is a
``clowning genius'' who could have used better material.

<TEXT>
   Jessica McClure, the toddler pulled from an
abandoned well two years ago as the nation watched rescuers
struggle for 58 hours, is now 3 years old and capable of stealing
the spotlight from even President Bush.
   Bush scooped the Midland, Texas, girl into his arms Wednesday
during a White House ceremony honoring Sioux City, Iowa, for its
response to the crash of a United Airlines jumbo jet last July 19.
   Jessica grabbed Bush's glasses off his face and faced the
clicking cameras with them balanced on her nose.
   Even as he walked into the Roosevelt Room to present the Midland
Community Spirit Award to Sioux City, Jessica did not appear
impressed.
   ``Who's that, mama?'' asked the blue-eyed girl in a red corduroy
smock with Winnie the Pooh on the front, tossing her ponytail.
   Later, as she returned his glasses to Bush's breast pocket,
Jessica discovered the president's white handkerchief.
   ``This may make that _ what do you call it? _ the blooper of the
week,'' said the president after Jessica tried to drape the
handkerchief over his head and dabbed his nose.
   ``I'm sorry about that. You can go to your mother,'' he said,
laughing and handing the wriggling girl to her mother, 20-year-old
Reba ``Cissy'' McClure.
   After paying tribute to Sioux City as an example of his
``thousand points of lights'' volunteerism, Bush said, ``Thank you
all and as for you, Jessica, where's my handkerchief?''
   And as the audience howled, Bush asked: ``How old are you now?''
   She held up three fingers.
   ``C'mon Jessica. You want to see where I work?'' Bush said, and
the two, with her parents trailing behind, bounded off to the Oval
Office.
   Mrs. McClure said the Oct. 16, 1987 rescue of her daughter, who
was 18 months old at the time, was similar to the rescue of
passengers trapped inside Flight 232.
   ``Everybody pulled together to save the people,'' she said.
``There were people trapped in that plane and couldn't get out _
mothers and fathers and children and they couldn't find them. And
that's exactly how I felt _ I was running through the back yard
looking for my child and I couldn't find her.''
   Mayor Carroll Thomas said the Midland Community Spirit Award
would be given annually to recognize ``the community that best
exemplifies volunteerism and compassion and concern for their
fellow citizens.''
   There were 85 entries for the award, with the words: ``Nothing
the heart gives away is gone; it is kept in the hearts of others''
around a bronze reproduction of a plaque at Midland's civic center
that shows rescuers bringing Jessica out of the well.
   The United DC-10 crashed in Sioux City after its rear engine
disintegrated in flight, severing the plane's hydraulic system and
making it virtually impossible to control. The crew almost landed
the plane, but it crashed on the runway, killing 112 people.
Another 184 passengers survived.

<HEAD>Army Gets Shoot-on-Sight Orders Against Armed Tamils</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK CRUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government troops have been ordered to
shoot on sight anyone carrying arms in areas being vacated by
Indian peacekeeping troops, the foreign minister said today.
   Young Tamils armed with AK-47 assault rifles and wearing
military-style uniforms have been seen in such areas.
   Indian troops, who are scheduled to leave Sri Lanka by the end
of December, withdrew from one such area, the east coast's Ampara
district, last week.
   Foreign Minister Ranjan Wijeratne spoke to reporters at a weekly
Cabinet briefing, where he was asked whether a ``Tamil national
army'' had been armed and trained by the departing Indian soldiers.
   ``We do not believe this Tamil army exists, but if they do, they
are strongly advised to surrender their arms to law enforcement
authorities without further delay,'' said Wijeratne, who is also
deputy defense minister.
   ``If they do not, they will be destroyed by Sri Lankan armed
forces and police wherever they are found,'' he added.
   The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the most powerful of the
Tamil militant groups in northern and eastern Sri Lanka, issued a
statement Tuesday claiming: ``Under the pretext of defending the
Tamils and Moslem people, the Indian government is organizing an
army of cronies.''
   The Tigers are engaged in a power struggle with other Tamil
groups that have been friendly with India.
   A spokesman for the Indian High Commission, or embassy, denied
Indian troops had trained anyone other than a civil volunteer force
that is supposed to help Sri Lankan police. He spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   An Associated Press reporter who visited eastern Sri Lanka last
week saw trucks loaded with young armed Tamils heading out of
Batticaloa on the road to Ampara.
   Local Tamil militant leaders said the youths were part of a
militia that claims 10,000 recruits and is separate from the
civilian volunteer force. They said the militia was needed to
ensure that the Tamil-dominated provincial council is given the
powers promised it by the central government.
   Indian troops were sent to northeastern Sri Lanka in July 1987
to enforce a peace plan designed to end a separatist war by
guerrillas from the Tamil minority. Since then, more than 1,100
Indian soldiers have been killed in ambushes and battles with
Tamils who refused to surrender their weapons.
   The Sri Lankan government, which is dominated by the Sinhalese
majority, has been trying to work out a peace agreement with the
Tamil Tigers.
   Tamils make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people and
are mostly Hindus. Sinhalese account for 75 percent of the
population and are mostly Buddhists.
   India got involved in the internal affairs of its small island
neighbor through its role as the region's biggest power and the
sympathies of its own politically powerful minority of 60 million
Tamils for their Sri Lankan brethren.

<HEAD>Utility Withdraws Bid for Lead Seabrook Owner</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Massachusetts utility has withdrawn a $2 billion
offer for the financially troubled Public Service Company of New
Hampshire and its share of the stalled Seabrook nuclear plant.
   John Rowe, president of New England Electric System, said
Wednesday that other utilities' competing bids and the rates that
would be needed to support those offers are too high.
   Public Service, New Hampshire's largest power company with
nearly 400,000 customers, owns 36 percent, the single largest
share, of Seabrook. The plant is fighting for a license as its
price climbs, standing now at about $6.3 billion.
   Emergency planning obstacles contributed to delays at the plant,
which originally was scheduled for commercial operation 10 years
ago, and sent the utility into bankruptcy protection in 1988.
   The other bidders for PSNH are United Illuminating Co. of New
Haven, Conn., and Northeast Utilities of Hartford, Conn. United
Illuminating has offered a bid it values at $2.29 billion.
Northeast Utilities bid $2.25 billion.
   New Hampshire Gov. Judd Gregg had endorsed the offer by New
England Electric. On Wednesday he said he hoped another bidder
would meet the state's criteria of sound management, adequate
electricity supply and affordable rates.
   ``I still feel there are enough players at the table to meet
those criteria, and we're still working very hard with those
players ... to reach that sort of agreement,'' he said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A paroled killer was convicted of murdering an
art student who struggled to hold her purse during a robbery one
week after she moved to New York from Arkansas.
   A jury deliberated less than four hours before finding Frank
DeChirico, 39, guilty Wednesday of murder and robbery.
   The victim, Judith Anne Wrappe, 24, had moved from Little Rock,
Ark., to become a graduate student in art at the Pratt Institute in
Brooklyn.
   She was shot in the chest in 1988 as she returned to her
dormitory early in the morning from a part-time job as a waitress.
She had $27 in her purse.
   ``I'm glad it's over,'' Sue Wrape, the victim's mother said from
Little Rock. ``We had confidence in the system.''
   DeChirico faces 25 years to life in prison at sentencing Nov. 27.
   Phillipe Morales, a 19-year-old jailed drug dealer, testified he
was in the neighborhood to break into cars and saw DeChirico run
past clutching a purse moments after the shooting.
   DeChirico served 13 years in prison for manslaughter for killing
an acquaintance in 1973. He was out on parole when Ms. Wrappe was
killed.

<HEAD>Insider Dealing Rumors Shake Market: Transport Secretary Denies Involvement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Transport Secretary Cecil Parkinson today denied
engaging in insider trading as rumors swept London's financial
markets of a scandal involving a Cabinet minister in the
Conservative government.
   Share prices tumbled in early trading but recovered later, amid
the rumors that a Cabinet minister was about to quit Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's government because of the alleged scandal.
   The jittery market reaction and the speculation that Parkinson
was involved reflected edginess about the government.
   It already was shaken by last week's resignation of Chancellor
of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson in a policy dispute with Mrs.
Thatcher.
   In the first hour of trading, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index fell 12.7 points, but share prices rallied after
Parkinson denied involvement and a television network that was
conducting the investigation said its program was not yet ready.
   At 11 a.m. (6 a.m. EDT), the 100-share index stood at 2,157.1,
down 3 points, or 0.1 percent, from Wednesday's close.
   Parkinson, in a statement issued through his lawyer, Peter
Carter-Ruck, said there was ``no foundation whatsoever'' in the
rumors, adding he has not ``engaged in any insider dealing, nor in
any share dealings.''
   The statement said Parkinson transferred his funds to
stockbrokers when he became a Cabinet minister and he has since
``played no part whatsoever'' in any investments his brokers made.
   ``The rumor that he might resign as minister of transport is
totally without foundation,'' the statement said.
   A spokeswoman at Mrs. Thatcher's Downing Street office said she
had no information on the insider trading rumors involving
Parkinson.
   ``We have no knowledge of this and we can't comment,'' she said.
   The rumors began today after The Scotsman, a respected daily
based in Edinburgh, reported that Britain's Channel 4 television
network has investigated a insider-dealing group which allegedly
has at least one senior government member among its clients.
   In a statement, Channel 4 confirmed it is working on the
investigation but said the program was ``as yet neither complete
nor scheduled.'' The network declined to elaborate.
   The Scotsman said the program ``claims that the secret
share-buying ring has been carrying out transactions on behalf of a
number of clients, some of whom may not know the precise nature of
the dealings, but who have all benefited from them.''
   Insider trading is the illegal attempt to profit by buying and
selling stock based on inside information about a company, such as
takeover offers or profits prospects, which is not available to the
public.
   Mrs. Thatcher reappointed Parkinson to the Cabinet in 1987, four
years after he resigned when news broke that his ex-secretary was
pregnant by him. The secretary, Sara Keays, who now has his
daughter, said that Parkinson had reneged on promises of marriage.
He stayed with his wife.

<HEAD>Ballet Dancers Getting Poison Pen Letters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LINCOLN, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dancers of the State Ballet of Rhode Island
have been receiving phony letters telling them to quit for being
fat, old or disruptive, and the artistic director blames another
dance company.
   Police said Wednesday they were checking fingerprints on the
letters, which are typed on stationery resembling the ballet
company's and bear artistic director Herci Marsden's forged
signature.
   ``This is more than a prank,'' said Detective David S. Ethier.
``It's (Marsden's) business and personal reputation that has a
chance of being destroyed.''
   Marsden charged that another dance company that she would not
identify sent the poison pen letters in an attempt to steal her
dancers.
   Ethier said police had no suspects but did not believe anyone in
Marsden's company was sending the letters.
   The letters ordered the dancers to quit for reasons ranging from
being overweight to being too old. One letter to an 11-year-old
apprentice accused her of being disruptive.
   ``You are upsetting my girls and causing trouble in my school
and in the ballet company,'' the letter said. ``Your family is also
upsetting people. You are not to return here.''
   Marsden said a 20-year-old ballerina quit after receiving a
letter, despite Marsden's insistence it was phony.
   About a dozen apprentices and members of Marsden's 30-year-old
semiprofessional dance company received the letters, postmarked in
Providence Sept. 4.
   The non-profit company has 50 to 60 dancers. Only guest artists
and principal dancers get paid.
   Marsden said that she has dismissed one dancer in five years and
that if she has a complaint, company members ``have to face me and
I tell them to their faces what they have to do.''
   ``But I'm a very easy person to live with,'' she said.

   The official said the accident occurred in the early morning in

<HEAD>More Than 1,500 Confess to Economic Crimes in Beijing, Shanghai</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 1,500 people in Beijing and Shanghai
confessed to committing white-collar crimes in exchange for
leniency under a nationwide campaign, newspaper reports said today.
   During the 10-week campaign, 340 businessmen and government
officials in Beijing confessed to embezzlement, taking bribes and
other economic crimes involving a total of $1 million, reported the
Beijing Daily. About $389,000 was returned, it said.
   In Shanghai, China's largest city and major industrial center,
1,175 people had surrendered to authorities by Monday, admitting
they illegally received $2.08 million in Chinese cash. About half
of that was returned, according to the local newspaper Wen Hui Bao.
   Among those who confessed in Shanghai were factory bosses,
managers and mid-level officials of various enterprises, the Wen
Hui said.
   News reports did not say how many Chinese confessed in other
cities during the nationwide campaign. It was the latest effort in
China's drive to root out corruption and white-collar crime which
have spread rapidly under the economic liberalizations of the last
decade.
   The Supreme People's Court and Supreme People's Prosecutor's
office announced on Aug. 15 that all people who turned themselves
in to authorities for economic crimes by Oct. 31 would be treated
leniently.
   The government has stepped up anti-corruption crackdowns since
the pro-democracy demonstrations earlier this year. Ending
corruption was a popular demand among students, workers and other
residents who filled Tiananmen Square and the streets of Beijing
during the protests, which were violently suppressed by the Chinese
army in early June.
   Also today, the Communist Party said that despite weeks of
ideological indoctrination, some Chinese college students still
``have knots to be untied'' because they believe their
pro-democracy protests this past spring were patriotic.
   Commentaries in two major newspapers, including the main party
paper People's Daily, also called on students and intellectuals to
embrace socialism and the party's leadership, or their aspirations
will ``vanish like soap bubbles.''
   As part of its program to stem a resurgence of the movement on
Beijing's university campuses, authorities required a month of
political study of all students before the beginning of the fall
semester.
   The bloody suppression of the protests in June by the Chinese
army left at least hundreds of unarmed civilians dead. Since then
the government has insisted that the protests were misled by a
clique of ``counter-revolutionaries'' seeking to topple the
country's communist leadership.

   Lebanese policemen and Algerian military
observers will form a one-mile security zone around Parliament
headquarters this week to protect lawmakers electing a new
president, an Arab League envoy said today.
   Arrangements call for a safe area around the Villa Mansour in
the area of of Beirut's dividing Green Line, which separates Moslem
and Christian forces, envoy Lakhdar Ibrahimi was quoted as saying
by the independent newspaper An-Nahar.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named in line with
regulations, said police will begin patrolling Friday evening.
   Parliament speaker Hussein Husseini, defying opposition from
Christian leader Gen. Michel Aoun, summoned the 73 surviving
legislators to three consecutive sessions Saturday.
   The first session will be to elect a new house speaker, the
second to ratify an Arab League-brokered peace plan to end the
nation's 14-year-old civil war and the third to elect a new
president.
   The peace plan was worked out by 63 parliamentary deputies in 23
days of deliberations in Taif, Saudi Arabia, in October.
   The accord raises the 99 seats of the unicameral house to 108,
to be evenly distributed between Moslems and Christians; increases
the speaker's term to four years and strips the president of the
authority to appoint and dismiss prime ministers.
   Under the previous governing arrangement, the Christians held
the edge in political power.
   The plan also called for a partial Syrian military withdrawal
from Moslem west Beirut and its environs within two years.
   The peace plan, according to the constitution, must ratified by
a parliamentary session in Lebanon to become legally binding. But
it also must be accepted by the militia leaders to have any effect.
   Aoun, 54, a Maronite Christian, rejects the plan because it does
not include a clear timetable for the withdrawal of Syria's 40,000
troops.
   The accords, however, have won wide support in Lebanese and
international circles. Syria's Moslem and leftist allies said no
moves would be taken to obstruct its implementation.
   The permanent members of the U.N. Security Council _ Britian,
China, France, the Soviet Union and the United States _ have
praised the peace plan.
   Aoun, in a statement released by his press office today,
welcomed the statement issued by the five, terming it ``a positive
stand.''
   Aoun also urged President Bush to reconsider American policy on
Lebanon. He did not refer to specific elements he wanted changed.
   The United States has called the Taif accord a positive
development. It evacuated ambassador John McCarthy and 29 other
American diplomats from Lebanon Sept. 6 after saying security
around the embassy was inadequate.
   Aoun accuses the Syrians of betraying a 1976 peacekeeping
mandate from the 22-nation Arab League by siding with Moslems
against Christians in the civil war.
   Aoun, who heads an interim Christian military cabinet vying for
power with the Moslem government of acting Prime Minister Salim
Hoss, has threatened to dissolve Parliament to block implementation
of the peace plan.

   Investigators offered three possible motives
for the botched Halloween night shooting of a son of jailed mob
boss Nicodemo ``Little Nicky'' Scarfo _ revenge against the father
or battles for power or turf.
   Nicodemo Scarfo Jr., 24, was recuperating under police guard
today at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital after being shot by a
masked man as he dined at an Italian restaurant. Scarfo was knocked
out of his chair, falling face down in a pool of blood and tomato
sauce.
   Dr. Jerome Vernick, director of the hospital's trauma center,
said Scarfo was hit by at least four bullets, in the arm, behind
the ear, in the shoulder and in the chest. He said Scarfo was in
fair condition.
   Police said he may have been shot for revenge against the
failure of his father, who headed the Philadelphia-southern New
Jersey mob for nearly a decade, to keep his Mafia members from
becoming government informants.
   At least five already have given the authorities information
that has helped result in the convictions of the elder Scarfo and
about two dozen of his men on assorted charges, including
racketeering, murder and extortion.
   When the 60-year-old Scarfo was sentenced to 69 years in the
federal penitentiary at Marion, Ill., some sources said his middle
son, Nicodemo Jr., sought to take over his father's gambling and
loan sharking activities.
   Young Scarfo, known for his wraparound sunglasses and
slicked-back hair, was said by acquaintances to relish his
closeness to the mob throne.
   Louis Pichini of the U.S. Organized Crime Strike Force said
there were three possibilities of why young Scarfo was shot.
   ``One is that he could have been the victim of an internal
struggle to take over what was left of Scarfo's organization,''
Pichini said.
   ``Second, he could have been the victim of outside mob forces
from New York trying to move in and he was representative of the
existing group here, or what was left of it.
   ``And the third possibility is that those mobsters in New York
were upset about the number of defectors in the Philadelphia
organization and Scarfo's lack of control, and were retaliating
with a deadly message to show they didn't like it one bit.''
   A half-dozen police officers guarded Scarfo in the hospital.

<HEAD>Physician Indicted on Illegal-Abortion Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANDERSON, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A gynecologist accused of romancing three
patients and getting them pregnant has been indicted on charges he
performed or attempted abortions on them without their consent.
   Dr. Pravin D. Thakkar, 38, of Frankton _ who also faces several
lawsuits, professional ethics charges and federal financial charges
_ surrendered Wednesday, pleaded innocent and was freed on $100,000
bail.
   Defense attorney Jeffrey A. Lockwood said of the indictment, ``I
haven't read these. but I listened to the judge read them, and I'm
at a loss to find anything that's new in all of this.''
   Thakkar was indicted on charges including two counts of
performing illegal abortions and one of attempting to perform an
illegal abortion. He could receive up to 42{ years in prison if
convicted on all counts, said Prosecutor William Lawler Jr.
   Cathy D. Collins and Carmen Brutchen Hertzinger of Anderson had
accused Thakar of impregnating them and performing abortions on
them without their consent in 1988 and 1983 respectively.
   Prosecutors said he also got Bonnie Coffey-Myers of Indianapolis
pregnant and administered an injection intended to induce an
abortion in 1987. She aborted six days later.
   Thakkar was charged with attempting an abortion in that case.
   ``I think justice is being served,'' said Ms. Coffey-Myers. ``If
anything, I'm disappointed that more counts couldn't have been
handed down. But I'm hoping what was handed down was enough to put
him away for a while.''
   Allegations against Thakkar, a native of India who set up his
medical practice at Frankton in 1981, became public in February
when Collins and Hertzinger sued.
   That same month, nearly a dozen former patients went before the
state Medical Licensing Board with allegations of sexual misconduct
and abuse. The board has suspended his license.
   Thakkar goes on trial Monday on charges he violated financial
reporting requirements by withdrawing more than $132,000 from bank
accounts in chunks of just under $10,000.
   Transactions of $10,000 or more must be reported by financial
institutions to the IRS.

<HEAD>Army Raids Palestinian Journalist's Home</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Palestinian journalist who works for The New
York Times and the CBS television network said today that the army
raided his home and later tried to intimidate Arabs who work with
him.
   An army spokesman confirmed that troops raided the Gaza City
home of Taher Shriteh on Monday and seized material for a military
investigation. In addition to the American news media, Shriteh also
works for the London-based Reuters news agency.
   The spokesman, who cannot be named under military rules, said
the raid was conducted because ``prior information supports the
suspicion that ... he may be involved in incitement or support of
violent disturbances.''
   The occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip have been rocked by a
Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule for the past 22 months.
   The army closely monitors and censors Palestinian newspapers,
and has raided Palestinian press offices and the homes and offices
of several Arab journalists, including one who works for The
Associated Press.
   Shriteh said that on Monday, seven soldiers broke into his house
and searched his office and bedroom. The material they confiscated
included reports he submitted to Reuters, his telephone directory
and five videotapes.
   He said three of the videotapes were of demonstrations he filmed
for CBS, one was a movie and one was a tape of his 1987 wedding.
   Shriteh said an officer working with the military administration
in Gaza, Capt. Yaacov Sabagh, later called three people named in
Shriteh's phone directory and told them to stop supplying him with
information.
   ``They are trying to limit my work and scare people from helping
me,'' Shriteh said.
   An army spokesman refused to confirm or deny if the army called
Arabs named in Shriteh's book but said, ``We are checking that
there will be no unauthorized use of the material taken.''
   Shriteh said the book was returned Thursday along with about
half of his files.
   ``What they did is a clear violation of my rights as a
journalist,'' he said. ``If they think that reporting the news
incites riots, then all of the foreign press is guilty of
incitement.''

   A hunter found the body of a strangled 4-year-old in Washington,
a search was called off for a boy lost in snowy Oregon woods, and a
missing-child support group promised a nationwide mailing to help
find a kidnapped Minnesota boy.
   The Kevin Collins Foundation, named after an abducted California
child, opened an office in St. Joseph, Minn., Wednesday to organize
volunteers in sending out at least 90,000 fliers starting today.
   That signaled to Jerry Wetterling that the search for his
11-year-old son, Jacob, could drag on. Jacob was kidnapped Oct. 22
on a rural road near his home in St. Joseph, a town of 3,000.
   ``I'm preparing myself for the long haul,'' the boy's father
said.
   Lee Joseph Iseli, a boy who disappeared from a Portland, Ore.,
playground on Sunday, was discovered strangled Wednesday near
Vancouver, Wash., Coroner Arch Hamilton said. A hunter found the
nude body in brush near a lake.
   Authorities said they had no suspects. Prosecuting Attorney Art
Curtis said an expert on child sexual abuse had been consulted.
   Sheriff Frank Kanekoa said nothing has been found to link the
killing to the fatal stabbings on Labor Day weekend of William
Neer, 10, and Cole Neer, 11, in a park in the city of about 45,000
people.
   In Oregon, searchers said they ran out of places to look for
Nathan Madsen, 9, of Veneta, who disappeared with his pony Oct. 22
during a family cattle roundup.
   Authorities will continue investigating, Sheriff Carl Burkhart
said, but rescuers ended a search that peaked last week with 350
people involved.

   An ``awesome'' aftershock to last month's
deadly earthquake jolted Northern California, but the only harm
appeared to be more jangled nerves, authorities said today.
   The aftershock, which struck at 9:50 p.m. Wednesday and measured
4.4 on the Richter scale, was centered slightly north of the
epicenter of the Oct. 17 quake, said Pat Jorgenson, spokeswoman for
the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park.
   It was the 84th aftershock of at least magnitude-3.0 and the
21st of 4.0 or greater since Oct. 17. The largest aftershock was
magnitude 5.2 and hit 37 minutes after the Oct. 17 quake, which
measured 7.1 on the Richter scale.
   ``Awesome,'' said Santa Cruz County sheriff's dispatcher Kevin
Fink of Wednesday's jolt. ``We were sweating bullets for a few
seconds.''
   No damage was reported in Santa Cruz or Watsonville _ the region
of the epicenter _ and only minor damage was reported in San
Francisco's Marina District, which was devastated last month.
   ``Just bricks falling,'' said Officer Gordon Clark. ``People
have been calling in sheer panic saying, `The big one is on the
way.' We try to console them and tell them it's an aftershock.''
   The tremor came as California continued to try to repair its
vital transportation links, help displaced people rebuild their
lives and figure out how to pay for billions of dollars in damage.
   The Legislature was scheduled to begin a special session in
Sacramento today to decide whether to raise the state sales tax by
a quarter-cent for 13 months to pay quake costs. Gov. George
Deukmejian and the Legislature's top four leaders of both parties
have agreed on the plan, which would raise $800 million. The
current sales tax is 6 percent.
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency, which earlier rejected
a plan to use mobile homes to temporarily house residents displaced
by the quake, late Wednesday ordered 100 mobile homes sent to the
Watsonville area.
   The agency said in a statement that the need for the mobile
homes in Santa Cruz County, where many poor people were left
homeless, ``is a close call.'' It did not explain why it reversed
its position.
   The county had requested about 500 mobile homes, saying existing
vacancies cannot absorb the thousands whose homes were destroyed or
seriously damaged. FEMA has about 2,300 mobile homes on hand for
victims of disasters.
   Providing shelter has brought the Red Cross face to face with a
new problem _ coping with chronically homeless people along with
those who lost their homes to the earthquake.
   Sixty percent of the 160 people still sleeping and eating at a
Red Cross shelter in the Marina district were among the chronic
homeless, Red Cross spokeswoman Chris Garrett said Wednesday.
   ``This is a new phenomenon for the Red Cross,'' she said.
``Traditionally, we have three phases of disaster relief _ giving
emergency help, sheltering people and getting people back into
their homes. Now we're finding that people who didn't have homes
suddenly have homes with us and no place to go.''
   Mayor Art Agnos, responding to reports he was angry about Red
Cross suggestions that those who were homeless before the quake
were the city's problem, said he understood the organization's
difficulties. He denied he was unhappy with the Red Cross.
   By Monday, the Red Cross had sheltered 35,514 people at 39 sites
and served 211,646 meals.
   FEMA said the number of applicants for housing assistance,
grants and loans had topped 35,000.

   Hundreds packed the City Council chambers to
demand the resignation of a member who made a racial slur about the
late U.S. Rep. Mickey Leland.
   ``Houston does not need a racist to represent our city,'' said
JoAnn Gavin, one of 39 speakers who raised the issue Wednesday.
``Racism is not negotiable.''
   The councilman, Jim Westmoreland, listened intently during the
three-hour barrage, leaving once to get a cup of coffee, and later
told reporters he would not resign.
   Westmoreland had suggested to a reporter Oct. 18 that Houston
Intercontinental Airport be renamed ``Nigger International'' to
appease council members pushing to rename the airport for Leland.
The congressman was killed in a plane crash in August while aiding
famine victims in Africa.
   Westmoreland, a 16-year councilman seeking re-election to his
at-large seat next week, has apologized for the comment, while
claiming he actually said ``Negro International'' in joking about
the airport renaming.
   He also suggested during the interview that the white crosses
erected at the site of fatal traffic accidents caused by drunken
drivers be painted black to appease black citizens as well as those
against drunken driving.
   Speakers who appeared during the regular City Council session
weren't laughing.
   ``We tell a joke and our friends hear it,'' Skipper Lee told
Westmoreland. ``You tell a joke and the next day, it's on the
streets of New York City. You don't just speak for yourself. You
speak for Houston. We look up to you and we can't look up to a
racist.''
   Westmoreland said the matter has overshadowed other campaign
issues and prompted threats against him and his family.
   ``Any anguish this has caused anyone could not match the anguish
I've suffered and my family,'' he said. ``I'm truly sorry for my
comments.''
   He told reporters: ``The question of resignation is one I don't
think we have to make because we have a vote coming up. With all
the publicity this has generated, there's no one going to the polls
who won't know what the situation has been.''
   Most of the speakers criticized not only Westmoreland, but also
liberal Mayor Kathy Whitmire and black council members for not
speaking out strongly against the slur.
   Mrs. Whitmire set a special council session for Friday to
discuss a resolution against racist remarks. On Wednesday, she said
she has refrained from commenting on Westmoreland because he
answers to the voters, not to her.

<TEXT>
   The warden of the state prison where 123
people were hurt during two nights of riots was suspended after
guards charged officials did nothing about broken cell locks before
the second night of upheaval.
   Corrections Commissioner David S. Owens Jr. suspended Robert
Freeman, the prison's superintendent, on Wednesday. But Owens said
he ``will not publicly disclose or confirm the alleged facts in
order to preserve Superintendent Freeman's due process rights and
to maintain the integrity of the ongoing investigation.''
   The suspension was announced two hours after The Associated
Press reported that guards said inmates could go on a second
rampage because officials failed to fix broken control boxes after
the first night of riots.
   More than 15 correctional officers told AP the prison
administration was alerted, but ignored the problem.
   Several guards at the State Correctional Institution at Camp
Hill also said officials lied about what time they had secured the
prison after the first night of riots, Oct. 25. They added that the
administration ignored guards' reports that some inmates were
telling them a riot was planned.
   Corrections Department spokeswoman Sherri Cadeaux maintained
Wednesday that the medium-security prison was under control when
officials said it was: at 10 p.m. The guards contended some inmates
were still loose hours after that.
   Another department spokesman, Kenneth Robinson, would not say
whether the information revealed in Wednesday's AP story had any
bearing on Freeman's suspension.
   Freeman has an unlisted phone number and could not be reached
for comment at the prison Wednesday night.
   The fiery rioting left more than a dozen buildings destroyed.
Thirteen prison staffers were held hostage at various points during
the two riots.
   Sgt. Richard Gavin said he pointed out the broken lock control
panels to officials early in the morning, before the second riot.
He said he asked his supervisor for 43 locks to secure the inmates
in his area and received 19.
   The control panels _ known as lock, switch or rod boxes _ are 10
to 12 feet long and run the length of each tier above the cells,
guards said.
   During the first round of rioting, inmates removed metal covers
over the boxes, the guards said. On the second night, inmates
reached out of their cells and released a 2-inch lever in each box
to free themselves.
   Gavin said he showed several officials inmates could reach up
and release the lever.
   ``That's what we kept complaining about,'' Gavin said. ``It
would really blow you away if you were inside and I could show you
how simple it was.''
   At 10 a.m. Oct. 26, Gavin said, he was told to go home because
``I was not needed.'' He said the remaining locks had not arrived.
   The second riot started that night at 7 p.m., when prisoners got
out of their cells as the evening meal was served. Officials didn't
regain control until after 9 a.m. Friday.
   James E. Kraft, a guard with 13 years' experience, said the
prison was ``not secured for one second.''
   ``All they (inmates) had to do was reach out of those doors and
pop a switch,'' Kraft said.
   Some guards said they filed reports two weeks before the riot,
quoting inmates who had warned about the coming trouble.
   Prison spokesman John A. Palakovich said he could not comment on
the allegations because the investigation is pending.
   During the first night of rioting, the administration said the
prison was secured at 10 p.m. Oct. 25.
   ``They lied,'' Gavin said. ``I was personally there until they
escorted inmates into the blocks until 2 in the morning.''
   Palakovich stood by the official statement that the institution
was secured at 10 p.m.
   Ms. Cadeaux, the prison spokeswoman, said prison officials made
clear at the time that inmates were still being escorted to their
cells. But she stressed that officials were in control at 10 p.m.
   Kraft said neither the inmates nor their cells were thoroughly
searched after the first riot. Other guards backed up his story.
   When the riots first broke out, the prison located 5 miles west
of Harrisburg was nearly 45 percent over capacity, with 2,600
inmates in a 52-acre complex intended for 1,820.

   Louis Saavedra was elected mayor in a
lopsided victory over fellow Democrat Pat Baca despite the
revelation that he received a secret retirement perk from the
technical school he had headed.
   ``I tried to focus on what I felt were the issues,'' Saavedra,
56, said after his victory Wednesday. ``People believed that part
and totally rejected the negative campaign of my opponent.''
   The retired former president of the Albuquerque
Technical-Vocational Institute will take office Dec. 1, succeeding
Mayor Ken Schultz, who failed to make Wednesday's runoff.
   Unofficial returns gave Saavedra 39,745 votes, or 60.8 percent,
to 25,621 votes, or 39 percent, for Baca, a retired educator and
city councilman for the past 15 years.
   During the campaing, it was revealed that Saavedra secretly
received a paid-up $250,000 life insurance policy from the
technical school's board of directors.
   Attorney General Hal Stratton issued an opinion that the board
violated the state open meetings act when it purchased the policy
without a public vote. Saavedra resigned from the school last
summer to run for mayor.
   Baca conceded defeat with a parting shot at both Saavedra and
the Schultz administration.
   ``For the last four years it has been the City Council that has
had to assume the fight for openness and responsibility in
government,'' he said. ``I exhort the council to redouble their
efforts to monitor the administration.''

<HEAD>Lawyer: Reputed Soviet Spymaster Would Testify for Convicted Spy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet KGB general and reputed spymaster
is willing to testify on behalf of a former Norwegian diplomat
convicted of spying, the Norwegian's attorney said today.
   Gen. Gennady Titov would say that convicted spy Arne Treholt
never passed NATO secrets to the KGB, said Treholt's lawyer Arne
Haugestad. Treholt said this summer that he would request a retrial.
   Titov was declared unwelcome in Norway after Treholt was
arrested in 1984 and sentenced the following year to 20 years
imprisonment, Norway's harshest punishment. Titov was named at the
trial as Treholt's controller.
   At a meeting Wednesday with Haugestad in Moscow, Titov also
claimed that Norwegian intellegence sent him an unsigned,
handprinted letter in 1984 offering him $500,000 to defect to the
West, Haugestad told the NTB news agency.
   ``If the KGB is given the opportunity to testify in a Western
spy case it would be a historic and trailblazing event,'' Haugestad
said.
   He said Titov gave him documents and statements defending
Treholt, as well a copy of a letter Titov claimed was an offer to
defect for pay.
   Treholt, 48, was convicted of passing NATO secrets to the
Soviets during the 1970s and early 1980s. Photographs and other
evidence of Treholt's meetings with Titov were instrumental in the
case.
   ``I see the Treholt case as closed and am indifferent to this
new information,'' Jostein Erstad, of Norwegian intellegence, told
NTB. He refused to comment further.

   Many deaths could be prevented if the Bush
administration would require schools to put better mirrors on their
buses, some House members said today.
   ``School children at an alarming rate are being killed by their
own school buses,'' said Rep. Dennis Eckart, D-Ohio, chief sponsor
of a bill that would order the federal government to update its
safety standards for school buses.
   Eckart wants the government to require special mirrors that
eliminate driver ``blind spots'' that can leave children vulnerable
to being hit by buses.
   Jeffrey Miller, acting administrator of the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration, told the hearing the agency has
begun working on new rules for school bus mirrors and swing-out
``stop'' sign attachments. ``Therefore we believe that legislation
of this type is unneccessary,'' he said.
   Miller also told the panel the agency objects to the 180-day
deadline proposed in Eckart's bill. ``Arbitrary rulemaking
deadlines could interfere with our ability to complete the careful
analysis needed to assure maximum safety benefit,'' he said.
   A member of the National PTA board urged the panel to support
Eckart's bill, saying her meetings with the NHTSA left her
convinced the agency didn't consider the issue a top priority.
``NHTSA's attitude was one of a `big yawn' _ insensitive and
apathetic,'' said Millie Waterman of Mentor, Ohio.
   ``Today we're going to wake NHTSA up,'' promised Rep. Thomas
Luken, D-Ohio, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce
subcommittee on transportation and hazardous materials.
   ``We're going to find out why NHTSA is callously stalling on
updating its mandatory safety standard for school bus mirrors while
children are continuously being killed and injured throughout the
country,'' he said.
   Miller told a CBS-TV interviewer school bus-related fatalities
shouldn't be considered ``a big problem area.''
   ``When you look at the whole range of traffic crashes you find
roughly 40 or so ... school-age pedestrian fatalities associated
with school buses every year,'' Miller said. ``You find several
thousand fatalities of school-age children in other kinds of
traffic crashes.''
   Mrs. Waterman's husband, Harry, told Luken's subcommittee that
when he was in charge of transportation for Mentor's public schools
he installed state-of-the-art mirrors for about $100 a bus that
erased driver blind spots.
   The mirrors make the area in front of the bus and underneath the
front bumper visible to the drivers.
   Each year, an average of 26 children are killed and 470 children
are injured after being struck by a school bus, according to a
report issued in May by a research arm of the National Academy of
Sciences.

   A bigger bug than the bug from Brooklyn there
wasn't.
   A 1.88-inch cockroach found in a Brooklyn apartment defeated
entries from Texas and Florida to be declared this year's biggest
specimen of its genus.
   The creepy crawler did not, however, topple the 2-inch-plus mark
set by a specimen from Florida in 1987.
   The roach was given the award posthumously, having been dead for
several weeks.The man who found the Periplaneta americana in his
home, Peter Roman, won $1,000 and a lifetime supply of roach killer
from Combat Roach Control System.
   ``I'm sure he'll be very happy,'' said Barry Glass, president of
Big Apple Pest Control, who accepted the award for an absent Roman.
   Michael Bohdan, Combat field director, measured the insects with
electronic digital calipers.
   Second place went to a 1.78-inch roach entered by Howard Morrill
of North Miami, Fla. The third-place winner was a 1.77-inch roach
submitted by Michael Bartolone of Plano, Texas.
   Another bug, from Mexico _ ``it dwarfed the others,'' said
spokeswoman Brenda Burrows _ was disqualified by the judges, who
ruled that it was in fact a waterbug.
   The contest was held at the Explorers Club.

   Hundreds of people protesting the
trials of 15 Albanian separatists battled police in the troubled
province of Kosovo, and one protester was killed, sources and the
official Tanjug news agency said today.
   The demonstrator, identified as Bedri Sokolji, was shot dead
during a protest by about 1,000 people in the province's capital of
Pristina late Wednesday night, Tanjug said.
   Several smaller groups of demonstrators fought running battles
with police today in different Kosovo towns to protest the trial of
Azem Vlasi, a popular former provincial Communist Party chief, and
14 other ethnic Albanians, sources told The Associated Press on
condition of anonymity.
   The defendants are charged with engaging in
``counterrevolutionary activities'' and opposing constitutional
changes that limited the province's autonomy.
   Death is the maximum penalty on conviction of the charges, which
include inciting ethnic Albanians to riot and strike. Vlasi's
co-defendants are officials and workers at a zinc and lead mine
where a strike occurred in March.
   Shots were heard today in the Pristina district of Suncani Breg
where security forces used tear gas and firearms to quell a
demonstration by an unspecified number of ethnic Albanians, the
sources said.
   Four people barricaded themselves in a ``public building'' in
Suncani Breg, shooting at the police, which have surrounded the
area, Tanjug said.
   ``A real war is going on out there,'' said a source in a
telephone interview. He said the area was sealed off by heavy
police forces and armored vehicles.
   On Monday, police used tear gas and clubs to disperse a similar
demonstration of about 1,000 people. The same day, the trial was
adjourned soon after it opened as defense lawyers asked for a
change of venue. The lawyers said a fair trial is impossible in
Serbia because none of its courts could be considered impartial.
   Kosovo, with a predominantly ethnic Albanian population, is a
province in the republic of Serbia. For generations the Serbs and
ethnic Albanians have accused each other of discrimination.
   Vlasi, 42, on Monday described the proceedings as a show trial
and claimed he was the victim of a plot by archrival Slobodan
Milosevic, president of Serbia.
   Until his arrest in March, Vlasi publicly opposed Milosevic's
efforts to increase control over Kosovo, an autonomous province in
which 85 percent of the 1.9 million people are ethnic Albanians. At
least 24 people were killed in the March violence.
   Milosevic and the Serbian leadership argued the changes were
necessary because of alleged harassment of the Serbian minority in
Kosovo, the heartland of ancient Serbia.
   The trial has been denounced in the liberal Yugoslav republics
of Slovenia and in Croatia as a Serbian bid to intimidate ethnic
Albanian dissent in Kosovo.

   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens today asked Egypt
to release an Israeli-owned tanker seized because of an oil spill
in the Gulf of Suez, and other officials complained that the crew
was poorly treated.
   The two-week detainment of the Nyuta dominated the front pages
of all major Israeli dailies and raised tensions at a time of
deadlock between Egypt and Israel over efforts to arrange
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations.
   The 103,332-ton tanker flying a Panamanian flag was carrying
50,000 tons of crude oil from an Egyptian oil terminal to the
Israeli port of Eilat when it was stopped Oct. 21.
   Reports from Egypt said the ship spilled oil covering an area of
about 60 square yards. The tanker's captain, Joseph Zvi, and
Israeli officials have denied there was damage.
   Egyptian Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid agreed today to
raise the tanker's seizure with ``relevant'' officials following a
telephone call from Arens, an Israeli Foreign Ministry official
said. He did not disclose details of the call.
   Israeli Ambassador to Egypt Shimon Shamir on Wednesday appealed
to the Egyptian oil minister, Abdel Hadi Kandil, to intervene on
behalf of the crew of 24 Israelis and one Yugoslav.
   ``We hope and expect the problem to be solved soon,'' Shamir
told The Associated Press today.
   Israel's Energy Minister Moshe Shahal said he was willing to
offer Egypt an unlimited financial guarantees to get the Nyuta
freed.
   Israeli officials complained about the holding of the captain in
jail between his arrest Oct. 22 and his return to the ship last
Thursday.
   ``What has disturbed us is the treatment of some of the crew ..
. the fact that they didn't have water,'' added the Foreign
Ministry official, who asked not to be identified.
   A Foreign Ministry official said Israel had no plans to cancel
its annual purchase of 2 million tons of crude oil from Egypt,
stemming from the two countries' 1979 peace treaty.

<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. today made a friendly offer of $2.5
billion in cash for the struggling British luxury carmaker Jaguar
PLC, and General Motors Corp. said it would not try to outbid its
U.S. competitor.
   Jaguar, which had negotiated with General Motors to fend off
unwanted advances from Ford, recommended that its shareholders
accept Ford's offer of 850 pence, or $13.35, a share. Shareholders
must approve the deal by a 75 percent majority.
   GM spokesman Tony Spalding said in London later today that his
company would not bid for Jaguar shares.
   The world's biggest automaker, GM had U.S. regulatory approval
to buy up to 15 percent of Jaguar. But on Wednesday, GM Chairman
Roger B. Smith said he didn't expect a bidding war to erupt with
Ford.
   Ford and GM were looking at Jaguar to add prestige to their
lineups and a manufacturing plant in England, auto analysts have
said. Some also have said that a U.S.-backed Jaguar could offer
competition in the growing luxury car market to the this fall's
Toyota Lexus and Nissan Infiniti lines.
   Jaguar had been expected to become the target in a
multibillion-dollar bidding war between GM and Ford after the
British government announced Tuesday that it was prepared to waive
its ``golden share,'' which allows Jaguar to veto any takeover.
   Jaguar, which has suffered from a slump in the U.S. sales it
depends heavily upon, had been looking for a partner to give it
financial and technological support while remaining independent.
   The offer from Ford, which already controls 13.2 percent of
Jaguar, was lower than Jaguar's closing share price $13.80
Wednesday.
   ``It looks like Jaguar have settled for the best they could
get,'' said John Lawson, auto industry analyst at the Nomura
Research Institute in London. ``I don't see a higher, counter offer
emerging.''
   Said Peter Deighton, an analyst with brokerage County Natwest
Woodmac: ``To suddenly find that the management of Jaguar is
endorsing the bid from Ford and recommending it suggests that GM
have said they're not prepared to go this far.''
   Analysts had said that Jaguar could fetch $2.8 billion if Ford
and GM put competing bids on the table.
   In a joint statement, Ford and Jaguar said the deal represented
an important step toward helping Ford develop a presence in the
worldwide luxury car market.
   Under the deal, Jaguar said it would remain a ``separate legal
entity with a self-sustaining capital structure.''
   Jaguar's board would also operate independently, made up of
senior Jaguar management and directors nominated by Ford. Jaguar
would report to the chairman of Ford of Europe.
   Ford and Jaguar said they believed there was considerable
potential to increase sales by expanding Jaguar's product range in
Europe, the United States and elsewhere.
   Ford would inject funds into Jaguar to develop the company's
existing product range and boost its research and development
funding. In addition, Jaguar would be able to make use of Ford's
worldwide engineering, purchasing and manufacturing technologies.
   GM's friendly talks with Jaguar in recent weeks had been
expected to result in a deal by mid-November under which General
Motors would have acquired a stake of perhaps 30 percent.
   The pursuit for Jaguar became public on Sept. 19, when Ford
announced it would buy up to 15 percent of the carmaker.
   After obtaining U.S. regulatory approval, Ford said it was
prepared to mount a full bid for Jaguar once takeover restrictions
were dropped.
   Trade Secretary Nicholas Ridley said this week that if 75
percent of Jaguar shareholders vote to lift a 15 percent
restriction on holdings in Jaguar, the government would drop its
special share.
   The golden share and the 15 percent limit were due to expire at
the end of 1990.

   About 8,000 East Germans swarmed into
Czechoslovakia after East Berlin lifted a travel ban and many
reached the West German Embassy in Prague, seeking to follow
thousands of countrymen to the West.
   The resumption of what has been a historic exodus came as East
Germany's new Communist leader, Egon Krenz, arrived in Warsaw today
for meetings with Poland's Communist Party leaders and the new
Solidarity prime minister.
   Krenz said it was a ``great pleasure'' for him to meet Prime
Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the East bloc's first non-Communist
head of government. The two men shook hands warmly for the benefit
of photographers.
   ``I hope we will have not only good, neighborly relations, but
friendship as well,'' Krenz said. ``We have had good traditions and
I think we can continue those.''
   Pro-reform demonstrations continued across East Germany on
Wednesday. The state-run ADN news agency said 20,000 people marched
in Neubrandenburg and tens of thousands protested in
Frankfurt-on-the-Oder.
   The demonstrators have been urging reforms that include free
elections, a multi-party political system and an end to press
censorship.
   In an interview with West Germany's Saarland radio, an
opposition leader challenged the Communist Party's leading role in
East German society.
   ``If the party does not give up this claim, there will be no
democratization, no revival of the economy, no solution to the many
problems,'' said Ehrhard Neubert, a leader of the opposition group
Democratic Awakening.
   But a member of the largest opposition group, New Forum, said in
an East German newspaper interview that for his group ``the removal
of the Communist Party was not part of the debate.''
   Restrictions on travel to Czechoslovakia were imposed Oct. 3 by
Erich Honecker, whom Krenz has since replaced, in an attempt to
thwart an exodus of young skilled workers fed up with decades of
rigid Communist rule.
   Krenz rescinded the ban as he began steering East Germany on
what he termed ``a new course'' of tolerance and openness that has
included dialogue with the leading banned opposition group, New
Forum.
   More than 70,000 East Germans have fled to West Germany since
August through Hungary or after seeking refuge in West German
embassies in Warsaw and Prague.
   ADN said at least 8,000 East Germans crossed the border into
Czechoslovakia as East German authorities renewed visa-free travel
to the neighboring country. West Germany's ZDF television network
said this morning that nearly 1,000 East Germans had massed at
Bonn's embassy in Prague. ZDF added that more than 1,000 East
Germans were still in Warsaw waiting for passage to West.
   Krenz has said he wants political and economic changes but has
not indicated how far he is willing to go. He has, however,
announced an amnesty for people who fled to the West illegally or
were caught trying to escape.
   Additionally, a prominent East German lawyer reportedly said
Wednesday that the government has begun freeing some political
prisoners.
   After meeting in Moscow with Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, Krenz said East Germany would follow Gorbachev's path of
reform. He told reporters that the two had reached ``total
agreement on all questions we discussed,'' one of which was reform
in both of their countries.
   The West German newspaper Die Welt quoted East German government
attorney Wolfgang Vogel as saying his country already has begun
freeing political prisoners after pledging amnesty last week.
   Vogel said the released prisoners could choose to stay in East
Germany or apply for emigration to the West, Die Welt reported.
   He also reportedly said the West German practice of paying East
Germany for the release of political prisoners has ended.
   West German newspapers estimate that over the past 25 years, the
Bonn government has paid $1.3 billion to East Germany to ensure the
release of about 30,000 political prisoners to the West.
   ``We hope that there will be no new convictions based on
political grounds,'' the newspaper quoted Vogel as saying.
   According to West German estimates, there are about 1,800
political prisoners in East German jails.

<TEXT>
   South African allegations that black
nationalist guerrillas have crossed into northern Namibia a week
before pre-independence elections are based on ``phony'' radio
messages, a U.N. spokesman said today.
   Foreign Minister Pik Botha of South Africa said Wednesday his
country had placed its troops on alert and was prepared to delay
the Nov. 7-11 balloting because of the alleged incursion from
Angola.
   Botha said U.N. soldiers reported in internal radio traffic the
infiltration of 600 guerrillas of the South-West Africa People's
Organization over six days ending Tuesday.
   ``We believe the messages are phony in content and format,''
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard told a news conference.
   He said U.N. communications experts and military personnel
examined the information provided by South African officials and
determined ``the messages do not emanate from any (United Nations)
source.''
   Eckhard declined to comment when asked whether the U.N. believed
the South Africans fabricated the radio messages or if it was part
of a hoax by another party.
   Northern Namibia was ``exceptionally calm'' today, Eckhard said.
U.N. soldiers and territorial police were conducting regular
patrols along the Namibia-Angola border and had not reported any
evidence of an incursion.
   The United Nations has 4,650 soldiers in Namibia monitoring the
territory's transition to independence from South Africa.
   SWAPO's secretary for information, Hidipo Hamutanya, today
rejected Botha's claims, saying ``the whole thing is a smokescreen
by South Africa to influence the outcome of the elections.''
   President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia today said the South African
troop alert nearly plunged southern Africa into ``catastrophe'' and
that South Africa feared a guerrilla victory at the polls.
   ``They want to forestall that victory,'' Kaunda told a news
conference in the Zambian capital Lusaka. ``They want to throw the
whole region into turmoil.''
   Kaunda, chairman of the six-nation Frontline States bloc in
confrontation with South Africa, said SWAPO president Sam Nujoma
assured him there was no pre-election buildup of guerrillas.
   Martti Ahtisaari, the head of the U.N. contingent, said
Wednesday night the allegations of a SWAPO incursion were being
forwarded to a military monitoring commission made up of South
Africans, Angolans and Cubans who meet daily in the northern town
of Oshakati.
   The three countries signed a treaty last year under which South
Africa agreed to grant independence to Namibia, which it has ruled
for 74 years.
   SWAPO, which waged a 23-year bush war against South African
rule, denied any of its guerrillas were crossing into Namibia. The
organization is favored to get the most votes in next week's
balloting for seats in an assembly that will draft a constitution.
   Just 75,000 of the territory's 1.3 million people are white.
   Under a U.N. plan, SWAPO is not supposed to have armed forces in
the territory during the transition. South Africa has withdrawn its
troops, and law enforcement is being carried out by the integrated
territorial police.
   Botha said Wednesday of the alleged incursion: ``Unless this is
resolved within days, the South African government is reserving the
right to take whatever steps would be required to ensure that all
parties comply with their obligations.''
   Hamutenya said SWAPO still had 300 guerrillas in Angola, but
they were far north of the border and in compliance with all
international agreements.
   The chief of the South African Defense Force, Gen. Jannie
Geldenhuys, said Wednesday that thousands of SWAPO guerrillas were
violating agreements by being in southern Angola within 120 miles
of the Namibian border.
   He made no mention of guerrillas infiltrating Namibia.
   On April 1, the official starting day of the transitional
period, South Africa announced that hundreds of SWAPO guerrillas
had crossed into Namibia from Angola in violation of international
agreements.
   About 280 guerrillas and 27 members of the security forces were
killed in subsequent fighting, according to South Africa, which
received U.N. permission to deploy its troops against SWAPO.
   Botha warned Wednesday that if the alleged incursion does not
end ``there cannot be a free and fair election. That must be
obvious.''
   Botha said he met Wednesday with ambassadors of the United
States, Britain, Canada, West Germany, France and other countries,
urging them to do what they can ``to end this now.''
   He said he had been in contact with Ahtisaari and U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, but declined to say what
they told him.
   The treaty that paved the way for Namibia's independence also
calls for Cuba to remove its 50,000 soldiers from Marxist-ruled
Angola. Cuba announced earlier this week that 25,000 of the troops
had left on schedule.

<TEXT>
   Miners in the Arctic Circle are blocking coal
shipments to other Soviet regions to pressure the government to
keep its promise of better living and job conditions, official
press reports said today.
   Other miners in the Vorkuta region have walked off the job, and
Soviet officials warned that a drop in coal production could force
fuel rationing as the long and severe Russian winter begins.
   In the Ukraine's Donetsk Coal Basin, the country's top
coal-producing area, tens of thousands of miners walked off the job
for two hours Wednesday to press demands for higher coal prices, an
end to corruption and political reform, a strike leader said.
   Miner representatives were meeting again today to decide whether
to call a walkout. In Moscow, Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov introduced
a bill that would increase pension benefits by about 40 percent and
upgrade benefits for coal miners, Tass said.
   At the Vorgashor mine north of the Arctic Circle, a strike
continued for an eighth day, with a number of other mines in the
region holding two-hour walkouts Wednesday in support of the
Vorgashor miners, the Tass news agency said.
   Night-shift workers have walked out at three mines in Vorkuta,
and one mine is refusing to ship any coal, the Komsomolskaya Pravda
youth newspaper said.
   At the Komsomolskaya mine, miners have not stopped digging coal,
but are preventing it from being shipped outside Vorkuta, the paper
said.
   ``We do not expect any special privileges, nor are we depriving
other regions of food, goods or money,'' the miners said in a
statement quoted by Komsomolskaya Pravda. ``All we are asking is
that the government, the Coal Ministry and the union leadership
should keep their word.''
   In July, miners in the Soviet Far North and Ukraine ended a
two-week strike after the government passed a resolution promising
reforms, including improved social and economic conditions. The
miners now say the government is not fulfilling its promises.
   In a separate article, Komsomolskaya Pravda painted a stark,
sympathetic picture of a miner's lot in the Soviet Far North,
noting many do not see dayligh for months in this region where the
sun dips below the horizon in winter and miners toil below the
earth's surface.
   In Donetsk, the miners gathered in front of the House of Unions
to demand that the government set a deadline for implementing
reforms, Tass said. They called for an immediate announcement of
when improved benefits, including pensions and longer vacations,
will take place, the news agency said.
   A regional court in Vorkuta ruled that the walkout was unlawful,
but has not yet imposed any penalties on the miners. The miners
said they will appeal the court's decision in the Supreme Soviet.

   A man sent to prison for setting his son on
fire in a custody dispute six years ago has been given a release
date of Dec. 11.
   Charles Rothenberg was sentenced to 13 years behind bars after
pleading guilty to arson and attempted murder of his
then-6-year-old son, David. With time off for good behavior, he was
scheduled for release from Soledad State Prison.
   Superior Court Judge James R. Frank said he gave Rothenberg the
maximum when he sentenced him in 1983.
   ``He would have died in prison if I had anything to say about
it,'' Frank said.
   David was rescued from the flames but has had to undergo dozens
of reconstructive operations to repair the damage and severe
disfigurement caused by the burns to 90 percent of his body.
   The case was dramatized last year in an ABC movie, ``David,''
starring Bernadette Peters as the boy's mother and John Glover as
the father.
   Rothenberg, a one-time cab driver and waiter, told a KABC-TV
reporter in a prison interview that he is sorry for the crime and
would never hurt his son again.
   Expressing concern about his future, Rothenberg said he has no
job or home waiting for him and is unsure about how the public will
react to his freedom.
   Rothenberg's former wife, Marie Hafdahl, said she fears for her
son's safety as well as her own and doesn't believe her ex-husband
has changed.
   David, now 13, has said repeatedly he never wants to see his
father again.
   Rothenberg fled from New York to California with David in 1983
after Ms. Hafdahl refused to extend a visit and threatened to keep
him from seeing his son again.
   After giving David a sleeping pill in a Buena Park motel room,
Rothenberg poured kerosene on the bed, set it on fire and fled. He
was arrested six days later.

<HEAD>Missouri River States Battle Over Navigation Season</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   States upstream and downstream on the
drought-lowered Missouri River are arguing over how to control the
precious water flow.
   The concerns about dwindling water levels in the river's six
reservoirs drew about 80 people from Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri,
Colorado, Iowa, North Dakota and South Dakota at a U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers' hearing Wednesday.
   Storage in the reservoirs is at its lowest level since the
system was filled in 1967.
   Upstream officials urged that the river's navigation season be
shortened by two to three months to boost upstream flows hit hard
by three years of drought. But barge operators who operate
downstream oppose any further shortening of the season.
   ``We cannot continue to operate as if the drought doesn't
exist,'' said Tim Edman, special assistant to South Dakota Gov.
George Mickelson, in calling for a three-month delay in opening
navigation. ``We are not opposed to navigation.''
   The corps shortened the season by three weeks in 1988 and by
five weeks in 1989. The season begins and ends at different times
at different ports. This year, it opened in mid-April and ended
Oct. 25 in Omaha and Wednesday at St. Louis.
   Edman recommended during the meeting Wednesday that navigators
haul more tonnage during a shorter season. In 1987, about 2.3
million tons were shipped during a seven-month, three-week season.
   Don Huffman of Phoenix Towing in St. Louis said the lower river
levels have forced him to reduce the number of barges he can tow
and the tonnage of cargo on each barge, amounting to a 45 percent
loss of efficiency.
   ``We've been very drastically affected by this drought. This has
cost us a lot of money,'' he said. Further season cuts will raise
shipping costs and hurt the farm economy, he added.
   The one-day meeting is part of the process the corps uses to
develop its annual operating plan for the Missouri River. The plan,
due out in January, includes an overview of what happened in 1989
and how the corps will operate in 1990.

   A Soviet submarine became ensnared in the
net of a Norwegian fishing trawler today, but was freed when a
stormy sea tore open the net, a defense official said.
   Navy Capt. Stig Morten Karlsen of the Norwegian Supreme Defense
Command said neither vessel had been in danger.
   Darkness and the storm in the Barents Sea made it impossible for
the crews to go on deck to free the 2,000-ton conventional
submarine, and the crews had expected to spend a rough night
entangled together.
   But the force of the storm did the job for them, tearing the
fishing net to pieces under the weight of the submarine. Neither
ship suffered serious damage, said Major Geir Anda, of the
Norwegian Northern Defense Command.
   Karlsen said the vessels were in international waters, about 57
miles northeast of the town of Vardoe, on Norway's northern coast.
   The Soviet Foxtrot-class submarine, which carries a crew of 75,
was submerged on a routine patrol from a Soviet base at Murmansk
when it got snared in the nets of the trawler T.O. Senior, Karlsen
said.
   The submarine put up no fight and surfaced at once, cooperating
with the fishermen.
   ``It's totally different than the last time,'' said Karlsen. On
Aug. 13 another entangled Soviet submarine dragged a fishing boat
backwards, cut free and fled without identifying itself.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. and Soviet officials are jockeying over
expectations for next month's summit between President Bush and
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, debating whether it will be merely a low-key
meeting or a milestone in superpower relations.
   Planning for the Dec. 2-3 summit took a leap forward Wednesday
with the announcement that the talks will be held in the
Mediterranean on ships off the coast of Malta.
   An independent republic consisting of five islands, Malta lies
58 miles south of Sicily, 220 miles north of Libya and 180 miles
east of Tunisia.
   For years, Malta had strong ties to Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi, who stands accused by the United States of being the
paymaster for bloody acts of terrorism around the globe.
   But over the past two years Malta's government has taken a sharp
turn and welcomed U.S. investment.
   Asked today if the White House was concerned over security
because Libyans have free access to Malta, press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater said, ``There always are security problems, but we
believe they can be managed.'' He said it was the United States
that suggested Malta as the staging site.
   Fitzwater said Bush would be greeted briefly by Maltese leaders
on his arrival Dec. 1 and then spend the remainder of the trip
aboard a U.S. Navy ship rather than be based on land.
   With the staging area fixed, the White House said planning was
under way on the substance of ideas and issues that Bush will raise
with Gorbachev.
   The Soviets moved quickly to raise the stakes.
   ``I think that this meeting can just be the end of the Cold
War,'' said Soviet spokesman Gennady Gerasimov. ``The Cold War will
be dumped down to the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea.''
   Gerasimov's dramatic prediction stood in stark contrast to
Bush's portrayal of the talks as a relaxed opportunity for a
get-acquainted session with no expectation of any agreements.
   ``I don't think we expect substantive results,'' said a U.S.
official.
   The official, speaking only on condition of anonymity, said Bush
and Gorbachev were expected only to ``make sure we have good lines
of communication. It is not an area ripe for agreements.''
   In keeping with U.S. efforts to play down the meeting, Fitzwater
beat a hasty retreat after referring to the talks as a ``summit.''
   ``Let me retract the `S' word,'' Fitzwater laughingly told
reporters. ``Let's call this `The Meeting' _ the `Big M.'''
   He said the whole trip, including flying back and forth to the
talks, would not involve more than three days away from Washington.
   The principal subject for discussion is expected to be
Gorbachev's effort to boost the faltering Soviet economy through a
reconstruction program known as perestroika.
   It is spilling over into the political arena, encouraging
political reform at home and in Eastern Europe and challenging the
Marxist system and the cohesion of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
   While Gorbachev is expected to describe his problems in length
to Bush, officials said Moscow has given no indication through
diplomatic channels that the Soviet leader would ask for specific
technical or other U.S. help.
   ``Asking for direct help would not be suitable,'' one official
said. ``It's one thing to talk about your problems. It's another to
appear to be relying on the United States for help. The Soviets are
strongly independent about this.''

   A court Thursday ordered an Istanbul daily
newspaper to pay the equivalent of $8,700 in damages for insulting
President-elect Turgut Ozal's family in a series published in May.
   The court said the articles in the newspaper Sabah defamed Ozal
and his wife, Semra.
   Sabah was banned from publishing the series after the first two
parts, accusing his wife and aides of corruption, appeared in the
newspaper.
   The series alleged that a foundation set up by Ozal's wife to
work on social issues such as birth control actually provided
financial and political benefits for members.
   Ozal had asked for damages of about $34,800.
   Ten other suits against newspapers by Ozal are pending in the
courts.

   A senior police inspector has been fired for
allegedly grabbing a man's wallet on a crowded train during rush
hour last month, police said Thursday.
   Inspector Masatoshi Yamada was dismissed two days after being
accused of taking the wallet, said Katsumi Yakushiji, head of the
Honjo Police Station in downtown Tokyo.
   On his way to work on Oct. 23, Yamada, 54, boarded a commuter
train near his home in the northern outskirts of Tokyo and
allegedly stole a man's wallet containing about $21 from his hip
pocket, Kyodo News Service quoted Yakushiji as saying.
   The man caught Yamada and took him to a station keeper, who
notified police, it said.
   Yamada has denied the charge, saying jostling in the crowded
train caused his hand to clutch the wallet.
   A night duty officer at the Honjo Police confirmed the report,
but would not provide details, including whether any charges were
filed.

<HEAD>President Says African National Congress Rally May Lead To Prosecution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities are weighing whether
to prosecute people who participated in a rally honoring freed
leaders of the African National Congress, President F.W. de Klerk
said today.
   De Klerk said that during Sunday's rally there were ``apparent
contraventions'' of the Internal Security Act, which makes it a
crime to promote the aims of an outlawed organization.
   He said police were preparing a dossier for the attorney general
so he can decide whether to prosecute. De Klerk did not say when
the police investigation would be completed.
   Seven African National Congress leaders were freed
unconditionally on Oct. 15, but their guerrilla movement remains
outlawed.
   Speakers at the rally, including four of the freed guerrilla
leaders, endorsed the movement's use of violence and some quoted
exiled ANC officials _ both violations of security laws.
   More than 70,000 people attended the rally at a soccer stadium
outside Johannesburg.
   De Klerk, in a speech to a military parade, said his government
would not lift the ban on the congress as long as it remained
committed to violence.
   Regarding the freed prisoners, he said: ``They must guard
against being misused by those seeking continued confrontation.
They would also be wise to steer away from imflammatory rhetoric.''
   However, de Klerk said further major political changes were
needed to resolve South Africa's racial conflict. He gave no
specifics today, but has said previously that additional steps
under consideration include lifting of the state of emergency and
release of Nelson Mandela, the best-known African National Congress
leader, who remains in prison.
   Mandela is widely expected to be freed within the next few
months. Justice Ministry spokesman Dirk de Villiers described as
``just speculation'' a report today that tentative plans were being
made for Mandela to be released in January.

   A year ago, Murka the cat was banished from her
Moscow home for eating two canaries.
   Today, she is home, happy and pregnant.
   The saga of the feline who managed to find her way home from
Voronezh, 400 miles south of Moscow, was related in the newspaper
Komsomolskaya Pravda Thursday.
   The gray and white cat caught and killed the first canary two
years ago when it was out of its cage in the apartment of her owner
Vladimir Dontsov, the paper said.
   A year later, Murka somehow unlocked the birdcage and killed the
second.
   ``Thus it happened that she found herself in Voronezh. She was
exiled there to stay with the (Dontsov) children's grandmother,''
Komsomolskaya Pravda said.
   Murka stayed at the grandmother's house for only two days before
disappearing.
   On Oct. 19, Dontsov was on his way to work in Moscow when he
spotted the cat on the fourth floor of their apartment building,
dirty and hungry and minus part of her tail.
   ``Without any information desk, she found her way to the correct
neighborhood,'' the newspaper said.
   Komsomolskaya Pravda said the case of Murka was not unique, but
that animal psychologists still cannot explain how some animals can
find their way home from hundreds of miles away.
   Murka apparently found both adventure and romance during her
yearlong journey.
   ``It resulted in the loss of the tip of her tail and an injured
ear,'' it said. And, it added: ``She is pregnant.''

   Two new songs by Tracy
Chapman, including one about imprisoned black nationalist leader
Nelson Mandela, have been banned from the airwaves of the state-run
broadcasting company.
   Roelf Jacobs, chairman of the records committee of the South
African Broadcasting Corp., said this week that the two songs from
Chapman's new album, ``Crossroads,'' had been ruled undesirable for
use by the SABC.
   The songs are ``Freedom Now,'' which is dedicated to Mandela,
and ``Material World.''
   Chapman's album can be bought in South Africa, and the two songs
banned by the SABC can be heard on independent radio stations.
   Mandela, considered by many blacks as their paramount leader,
has been jailed since 1962. He was sentenced to life in prison in
1964 for his role in planning an anti-government sabotage campaign
to be carried out by guerrillas of the African National Congress.

   A U.S.-backed guerrilla group claimed
Thursday that Cambodian troops have resorted to shelling civilian
portions of a western provincial town they have been unable to
recapture.
   The Vietnamese-backed government forces fired Soviet-made 130mm
cannons and 122mm rockets into Thmar Puok in western Battambang
province on Wednesday, according to the resistance group led by
Cambodian Prince Norodom Sihanouk.
   It said 55,000 civilians live in Thmar Puok, one of several
towns the guerrillas captured in early October along Route 69 in
the province, which borders Thailand.
   No mention was made of casualties in Wednesday's shelling, but
the group said one civilian was killed and eight wounded when
government forces last shelled the area Oct. 23.
   The guerrillas seized Thmar Puok as part of their advance to
Svay Chek, the only big town blocking the way to the government's
military center of Sisophon, 25 miles south of Thmar Puok.
   On Wednesday, the official Phnom Penh radio said government
forces launched operations to clear Route 69 and that the enemy was
routed in one village in the area.
   But a resistance official, Abdulgaffar Peang-Meth, said Thursday
that Svay Chek ``is strangled and our forces have blocked off all
the access routes. Svay Chek will fall like a ripe fruit when the
time comes.''
   Abdulgaffar said few guerrillas have been killed in the battle
for Svay Chek, but many have been wounded by artillery shelling and
land mines.
   Abdulgaffar is the main military analyst of the Khmer People's
National Liberation Front. The front and Sihanouk's forces, both
non-communist, are joined with the Communist Khmer Rouge in a
guerrilla coalition fighting the government Vietnam installed in
Cambodia after invading in late 1978.
   All three groups have made significant battlefield advances
since late September, when Vietnam staged what it called the
withdrawal of its last troops from the country.
   Cambodia's official SPK news agency said Thursday that
authorities had instituted a nighttime curfew in Battambang, and
not martial law as reported by a Thai newspaper a day earlier.
   The Khmer Rouge guerrilla army has said it is advancing on the
provincial capital at Battambang, the country's second-largest
city, after taking the nearby strategic town of Pailin on Oct. 22.
   SPK, monitored in Bangkok, said the reported threat of a Khmer
Rouge attack on Battambang was merely propaganda to boost the Khmer
Rouge's standing at the United Nations. The General Assembly is
soon to debate the issue of Cambodia's seat at the world body, now
held by the guerrilla coalition.
   The fall of Pailin has heightened fears of the return of the
Khmer Rouge, which killed hundreds of thousands of people when it
ruled Cambodia for thre years until Vietnam's invasion ousted it in
1978.
   Vietnam said it completed pulling its troops out at the end of
September, but guerrillas say many of the soldiers have remained.

Tavares.
   ``His engines stopped, all I heard was a whistling overhead,''

   The pilot, who was testing the $2 million plane, tried to
parachute to safety but was hurt in the fall and died en route to
the hospital, Tavares said.
   The cause of the crash was under investigation.
   The Tucano, a turboprop plane that is lighter and easier to fly
than other training craft, has been sold to Argentina, Paraguay,
Britain and Middle Eastern countries in recent years.

   Christer Pettersson likely was the man
seen outside a movie theater where Prime Minister Olof Palme was
slain, but it has not been proved he killed the Swedish leader, an
appeals court said today.
   Police, however, said Petterson was still under investigation.
   Pettersson, 42, was convicted by a district court in July of
killing Palme three years ago and sentenced to life in prison.
   However, the Svea Court of Appeals court threw out his
conviction on Oct. 12 and ordered him freed, saying that there was
not enough evidence to conclusively prove his guilt.
   The appeals court today released its formal written ruling of
that verdict, making clear that there was not enough evidence to
convict Pettersson but also raising doubts about his innocence.
   Palme, who was prime minister for 11 years and Scandinavia's
leading international figure, was shot Feb. 28, 1986, while walking
home from a movie in downtown Oslo with his wife, Lisbeth.
   Mrs. Palme's testimony, the key evidence against Pettersson,
left too much room for uncertainty, the appeallate court said.
   ``It cannot be considered proved that the perpetrator is
identical with Christer Pettersson. Therefore, the court leaves the
indictment unsanctioned,'' the court said.
   But Ingemar Krusell, a senior investigator, said police have
formed a special squad focusing on finding evidence against
Pettersson while two other teams pursue other possible leads.
   ``Pettersson is still a suspect with us,'' the national news
agency TT quoted him as saying.
   The verdict said Pettersson had no alibi and was most likely the
man who was seen outside the theater apparently waiting for the
prime minister to leave.
   Pettersson had said he was at a surburban train station at the
time Palme was shot in downtown Stockholm.
   But the court said the prosecutor had not erased all doubts that
he committed the murder, and that Mrs. Palme's identification of
him was insufficient evidence.
   Mrs. Palme identified Pettersson as the man she saw a few feet
away when she looked up from her dying husband.
   But the court said Mrs. Palme had seen the gunman only for an
instant in poor light when she was under great stress, and that the
widow was asked to make her identification after a gap of three
years.
   The court also said there no murder weapon was found and that
Pettersson had no apparent motive for the slaying. Also, the
shooting ``gives the impression of a certain amount of planning''
uncharacteristic of Pettersson, the court said.

   West German authorities issued a
general warning about possible terrorist attacks the month before
the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, but there were no last-minute
warnings, an official said today.
   A bomb destroyed the plane on Dec. 21 over Lockerbie, Scotland,
killing all 259 people on board and 11 on the ground.
   Pan Am said in papers filed in U.S. District Court in Washington
that West German authorities had warned U.S. officials of
suspicious activities in the baggage loading area at Frankfurt
Airport shortly before Flight 103 left for London.
   The airline, trying to defend itself against more than $300
million in lawsuits filed by victims' families, specifically
referred to the Bundeskriminalamt, the federal criminal
investigations office that is the equivalent of the FBI.
   Pan Am said it wants information about any warnings from the
West German agency ``within the 90 minutes before the scheduled
departure from Frankfurt'' concerning suspicious activities in the
baggage loading area.
   In its report Wednesday on the Pan Am action, The Independent
newspaper in London said the subpoena mentions ``warning(s) from
the BKA within 90 minutes before the scheduled departure from
Frankfurt of Pan Am Flight 103 on December 21, 1988, to the effect
that suspicious activities appeared to be taking place in the area
where the baggage ... was being loaded.''
   The assertions brought a sharp denial today from the criminal
investigations office in Wiesbaden.
   ``We issued no such warning,'' Bundeskriminalamt spokesman Willi
Fundermann told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.
   The agency had issued a ``very general'' warning the month
before the attack following suspicions regarding a group of alleged
Palestinian terrorists rounded up in West Germany, Fundermann said.
   Some news reports have claimed the group, the Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, is linked to the Pan
Am bombing.
   The head of the Bundeskriminalamt press office, Brunhilde
Spies-Mohr, issued a written denial about the alleged warning
shortly before take-off.
   ``The Bundeskriminalamt rejects foreign news reports according
to which BKA officials allegedly pointed out to U.S. officials
`suspicious activities in the baggage area at Frankfurt airport' 90
minutes before the start of Pan Am Flight 103,'' she said.
   ``This report is without any foundation,'' Ms. Spies-Mohr said
in her written statement.
   West German officials have frequently criticized news media
reports, especially those in British papers, that have accused the
Germans of bungling the case.
   ``If the Bundeskriminalamt were to investigate things as badly
as occasionally portrayed in the foreign news media, we could be
certainly be accused of superficial work,'' Ms. Spies-Mohr said.
   Pan American World Airways also is trying to prove that Israel
warned U.S. authorities about an impending terrorist attack on
Flight 103.

<HEAD>Missouri River States Battle Over Navigation Season</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   States upstream and downstream on the
drought-lowered Missouri River are arguing over how to control the
precious water flow.
   The concerns about dwindling water levels in the river's six
reservoirs drew about 80 people from Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri,
Colorado, Iowa, North Dakota and South Dakota at a U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers' hearing Wednesday.
   Storage in the reservoirs is at its lowest level since the
system was filled in 1967.
   Upstream officials urged that the river's navigation season be
shortened by two to three months to boost upstream flows hit hard
by three years of drought. But barge operators who operate
downstream oppose any further shortening of the season.
   ``We cannot continue to operate as if the drought doesn't
exist,'' said Tim Edman, special assistant to South Dakota Gov.
George Mickelson, in calling for a three-month delay in opening
navigation. ``We are not opposed to navigation.''
   The corps shortened the season by three weeks in 1988 and by
five weeks in 1989. The season begins and ends at different times
at different ports. This year, it opened in mid-April and ended
Oct. 25 in Omaha and Wednesday at St. Louis.
   Edman recommended during the meeting Wednesday that navigators
haul more tonnage during a shorter season. In 1987, about 2.3
million tons were shipped during a seven-month, three-week season.
   Don Huffman of Phoenix Towing in St. Louis said the lower river
levels have forced him to reduce the number of barges he can tow
and the tonnage of cargo on each barge, amounting to a 45 percent
loss of efficiency.
   ``We've been very drastically affected by this drought. This has
cost us a lot of money,'' he said. Further season cuts will raise
shipping costs and hurt the farm economy, he added.
   The one-day meeting is part of the process the corps uses to
develop its annual operating plan for the Missouri River. The plan,
due out in January, includes an overview of what happened in 1989
and how the corps will operate in 1990.

<HEAD>Walesa Thanks U.S. For Aid, Looks Ahead to Trip</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa on Thursday
thanked the United States for its first emergency shipment of
grain, although he said he'd rather be accepting combines than corn.
   ``I am not delighted with this kind of help,'' said Walesa. ``I
treat this help as a kind of necessity, so we can work out
solutions.''
   The emergency food arriving from the United States and the
European Community is intended to help Poland weather shortages and
other ill effects of economic reform without an explosion of public
unrest that could threaten the Solidarity-led government of Prime
Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki.
   About 11,500 tons of U.S.-donated sorghum arrived by ship Monday
at the Baltic port of Gydnia, about 10 miles from Gdansk, the
headquarters of the Solidarity movement.
   ``We need more the means of production than the product itself
... but I am thankful for this help because it will enable us
peaceful reforms,'' Walesa said at his weekly news conference.
   ``I urge everone to produce food here,'' he said. ``For example,
it would be better if Americans could send the equivalent in
combines and machines and then the farmers could produce in
Poland.''
   Walesa will be able to deliver his message in person next week,
when he leaves for his first trip to North America. He will visit
Canada on Nov. 11-13 and then go to the United States, where he
will address Congress on Nov. 15.
   President Bush has been under pressure from Democratic
congressional leaders to increase the aid he proposed for the first
East bloc country not led by a communist.
   But Walesa said he is going to the United States ``to gain
friends and not to divide them'' and won't let himself be drawn
into a political struggle.
   ``Right at the airport I am going to say, `I am coming here only
to thank you and ask for understanding for the Polish reforms.
Please do not use me for election purposes and political aims
because they are your own internal problems and not our problems.'''
   Walesa said the journey represents ``my most difficult trip.''
   While he intends to thank Americans for their support over the
years, he said he also ``will try to urge the United States to turn
their eyes to Poland, especially in the time of reforms, and to
take part in those reforms.''
   Walesa, who was not allowed to travel abroad for seven years
after martial law was imposed to crush his independent union, made
his first foreign trip in 1988 to France.
   Since then, he has visited several European countries and it was
reported Thursday he will go to Britain on Nov. 29 at the
invitation of the General Council of the British Trade Union
Congress.

   All 42 of the federal judges in Medellin
went on strike indefinitely today following the slaying of a
federal judge and a congressman, apparently by drug traffickers.
   The strike was called after the Wednesday night slayings of
federal Judge Mariela Espinoza in Medellin and federal Rep. Luis
Francisco Madero in Bogota.
   The strike will continue until the judges get protection from
drug traffickers, federal Judge Jaime Gomez, president of the
42-judge federal panel in Medellin said in a communique.
   Meanwhile, 1,600 members of the National Association of Court
Workers in the state of Antioquia, of which Medellin is the
capital, declared a one-week strike to protest Mrs. Espinoza's
assassination, the union's Medellin office said in a communique.
   The Bogota branch of the union declared a four-hour strike for
today and Friday and a strike for all of next Tuesday and
Wednesday, the union office in the capital said in a news release.
   The union includes municipal judges and court employes.
   The strike was not declared for next Monday because that is a
holiday to officially celebrate All Saints' Day, which fell on Oct.
31.
   The president of Colombia's House of Representatives urged in a
broadcast interview that the government open talks with drug
traffickers.
   ``I insist that the door be opened to air these problems,'' Rep.
Norberto Morales told the Colombian radio network RCN.
   Two weeks ago, Morales told President Virgilio Barco that he had
talked with leaders of the Medellin cartel and that they want to
negotiate. Barco has rejected such talks.
   In Medellin, the national police on Wednesday raided an office
building owned by the reputed head of the Medellin cartel, Pablo
Emilio Escobar-Gaviria, the police said in a communique today.
   The police found records showing that 144 killers were on
Escobar's payroll. The killers were identified by aliases, the
police said.
   Meanwhile, the army caught up with a a column of leftist
guerrillas in Colombia's southeastern plains and killed nine of the
rebels, RCN quoted an army colonel as saying.
   Judicial employees, who struck for three days after another
Medellin judge was slain Oct. 17, say the government has not done
nearly enough to protect them and warned of a second strike.
   ``We are not willing to continue to be the targets in this
war,'' said Helmut Romero, president of the court workers' union.
The workers demand bodyguards and bulletproof vests and cars.
   Ms. Espinoza, 43, was killed by assailants firing submachine
guns as she arrived home in Medellin, the heartland of Colombia's
cocaine trade.
   She had just arrived home in her car and was opening the garage
when gunfire poured out of two cars that raced by, police said.
   Two policemen on motorcycles who had escorted Mrs. Espinoza from
her office were preparing to leave when the shooting occurred, the
radio network Caracol said in a report from the scene.
   Mrs. Espinoza, hit at least 13 times, died immediately, the
police said.
   One of the policemen and a bystander were wounded, Caracol said.
   Mrs. Espinoza, a lawyer who was appointed a judge six months
ago, had been the target of two previous assassination attempts,
once when dynamite was found in her car and once when her office
was sprayed with submachine-gun fire.
   Rep. Madero was also accompanied by a bodyguard when he was shot
Wednesday night. The assailant who had waited in shadows attacked
as Madero arrived by taxi at his home in Bogota.
   Madero, 66, was rushed to a hospital where he died moments
later, a police spokeswoman said.
   Madero had organized a demonstration to protest drug trafficking
in Pacho, a city 60 miles north of Bogota, said a Conservative
presidential contender, Sen. Alvaro Leyva Duran. Eight years ago,
he had issued a congressional report supporting extradition of drug
suspects to the United States.
   After a leading presidential candidate was assassinated in
mid-August, Barco reinstated an extradition treaty with the United
States and the government began confiscating property belonging to
the drug lords, who went into hiding.
   The traffickers have since been blamed for scores of shootings
and bombings that have killed 36 people and injured 223.
   In the past decade, 221 court employees, including 42 judges,
have been killed in attacks blamed on drug traffickers. On Sept.
21, Justice Minister Monica de Greiff resigned following death
threats from cocaine barons.
   In an Aug. 23 message to a national radio station, drug barons
vowed to kill 10 judges for every drug trafficker extradited to the
United States to face trial.
   Five suspected Colombian drug traffickers have been extradited
to the United States since mid-August, but none of the leading
cocaine barons have been captured.
   Elsewhere in Bogota on Wednesday, a bomb damaged the front door
of a Mormon church, police said. No one was injured, the police
said. Caracol said the bomb caused about $7,000 in damage.

   The House today overwhelmingly condemned
Nicaragua's cancellation of a cease-fire, saying President Daniel
Ortega's complaints of renewed rebel attacks are ``a phony
pretext'' for renewing the fighting.
   The lawmakers voted 379-29 for a non-binding resolution
denouncing Ortega's resumption of military action against the
Contra rebels and opposing any effort to cancel or delay national
elections scheduled for next Feb. 25.
   Ortega must ``cease his reckless rhetoric'' and Nicaragua's
leftist leaders must fulfill commitments to ``end their aggression
in the region, end their tyranny over their own people and permit
the establishment of democracy inside Nicaragua,'' the resolution
said.
   Any attempt to put off the elections or to impose a state of
emergency ``under the phony pretext of a major Contra-initiated
breakdown of the cease-fire'' is deplored by Congress, it said.
   The resolution was identical to one passed 95-0 by the Senate on
Tuesday. House Republicans used a parliamentary tactic to
substitute the tough-worded Senate measure for a watered-down
version that had been approved on Wednesday by the House Foreign
Affairs Committee.
   In the committee's version, the U.S.-backed Contras were also
admonished not to interfere with or disrupt the election process
and to abide by the cease-fire; the Senate language focused
entirely on the actions of the Sandinista government.
   The resolution reaffirmed U.S. intentions to continue
humanitarian aid to the Contras _ now flowing at a rate of about $4
million a month _ through February. The aid is subject to review by
Congress at the end of this month, and could be halted if key
lawmakers believe the rebels are not conforming to the peace
process.
   The action reflected widespread outrage on Capitol Hill with
Ortega's Wednesday announcement, but also the feeling that it was
important to keep the elections alive.
   ``I can't conceive of the House moving now toward providing
military assistance'' to the Contras, said House Speaker Thomas S.
Foley, D-Wash. ``That's not in the direction of the peace process.''
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., suggested opposition
candidate Violeta Chamorro be invited to address a formal joint
meeting of Congress when she visits Washington next week, an honor
normally reserved for foreign heads of state.
   Longtime opponents of aid to the rebels said Ortega had put
those who had supported the peace process in a delicate political
position.
   ``Ortega is a damned fool, and he's always been a damned fool,''
said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., chairman of the House Appropriations
subcommittee with jurisdiction over the aid.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., Obey's Senate counterpart, noted the
issue of Contra aid had seemed dead. ``Daniel Ortega is doing
everything possible to turn that around. He is doing more to stir
support for it than anyone else in this hemisphere,'' he said.
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., said the United States should
urge international groups like the United Nations and the
Organization of American States to press Ortega to reconsider.
   ``I would like to think my colleagues would exercise some
caution and not go charging over the cliff,'' he said.
   ``The key right now is to try to act so swiftly and to send such
strong signals that military aid is not necessary because the
cease-fire ... doesn't get broken,'' said Rep. Newt Gingrich,
R-Ga., the No. 2 House GOP leadership official.
   But Gingrich added: ``It's important for the Congress on a
bipartisan basis to send a signal to Ortega that we are not going
to stand by and see people slaughtered by a communist army which
ruthlessly violates the cease-fire in order to pre-empt the
election.''

   Actor Paul Newman has donated $250,000 and
10,000 pounds of his spaghetti sauce to victims of the Bay area
earthquake, the Daily News reported today.
   Nell Newman, the actor's daughter, presented the money to the
American Red Cross quake relief fund in San Francisco, the
newspaper said.
   Newman is president of Newman's Own Inc., which makes spaghetti
sauce, popcorn, salad dressing and lemonade; Nell Newman gave the
sauce to Operation California, set up by the entertainment industry
to help quake victims.
   Another celebrity helping quake victims is singer Frank Sinatra.
He and the owner of a San Carlos, Calif., theater where he will
perform said they will donate $3 per ticket for earthquake relief.
   ``The San Francisco-Oakland area is up and running again and I
am proud to participate in the communitywide effort to rebuild and
move on,'' Sinatra said Wednesday in Rancho Mirage, Calif. ``I hope
others will join us as well.''
   Jim Burney, owner of the Circle Star theater, said the money
will go to the Red Cross relief fund.

   An angry police officer opened fire
Thursday when hundreds of radical students armed with rocks,
firebombs and iron bars attacked a police station in the southern
city of Kwangju, police and news reports said.
   One student was slightly wounded.
   The police officer fired two shots with a pistol, one into the
air and the other onto the ground, to scare away about 300 students
who attacked the police station near Chonnam University in Kwangju,
an opposition stronghold, police said.
   One student suffered slight flesh injuries when a bullet grazed
his left arm after piercing his jacket, according to Yonhap, the
South Korean news agency. The reports did not say whether the
student was taken to a hospital for treatment.
   Police reported no arrests. Students smashed windows of the
two-story police station, which was guarded by about 10 police
officers, Yonhap said.
   The news agency quoted witnesses as saying the policeman bolted
out of his station and opened fire after students did not disperse
under barrages of tear gas.
   Shouting slogans against President Roh Tae-woo, the students
fled to their campus, Yonhap said.
   In South Korea, police usually do not carry weapons, and police
using pistols or rifles to control demonstrators are uncommon.

<TEXT>
   The United States and Laos will conduct
another joint field effort this year to account for missing U.S.
soldiers, Laotian media said Thursday in reporting on talks between
both sides.
   The effort is to determine the fate of American soldiers listed
as missing in action from the Vietnam War, which also involved
fighting in Laos.
   The Laotian news agency said the expansion of joint efforts on
the issue was discussed in talks in Vientiane on Thursday between
teams led by David F. Lambertson, U.S. deputy assistant secretary
of state for Asian affairs, and Souban Salitthilat, Laos' deputy
foreign minister.
   ``In 1989, two joint excavations to find the remains of the
missing Americans were conducted together with a further survey,''
the report said. ``It is expected that this will also (be)
conducted late this year at a site in southern Savannakhet
province.''
   It was not clear from the report if a preliminary survey or an
actual dig would be conducted in Savannakhet, which is bordered by
Thailand and Vietnam.
   About 2,300 Americans are listed as missing in action from the
Vietnam War, about 545 of them in Laos. The war ended in 1975 with
Communist victories in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. The United
States has diplomatic relations only with Laos.
   In March, the U.S. Defense Department said a U.S. team found
human remains at a site in Savannakhet where a CH-34 helicopter
with seven crewmen crashed in 1968.
   Another search team visited Laos in May.
   Lambertson was on the delegation which U.S. presidential envoy
John W. Vessey Jr., led to Vietnam this week for talks on speeding
up work to resolve the fate of Americans there.
   Lambertson was accompanied to Laos by Ann Mills Griffiths, head
of the private National League of Families of American Prisoners
and Missing in Southeast Asia.
   The KPL report also said that on Sept. 30, the United States and
Laos signed a $200,000 aid agreement for rural development in the
northeastern province of Houaphan. The United States has boosted
humanitarian aid to Laos in return for its help on the missing
soldiers.

<TEXT>
   The White House said today it is unrealistic
to expect Nicaragua's Contra rebels to lay down their arms when the
leftist Sandinista government is out ``to destroy them'' by
breaking the cease-fire.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the United States
still backs the regional peace accord that calls for the Contras to
voluntarily disband by Dec. 5, and return to their homeland if they
so desire. But he also indicated that this support is tied to
Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega's decision to restart the war.
   ``You can't ask people to repatriate themselves into a climate
where they're threatened with death,'' the spokesman told
reporters. ``I don't think anybody expects demobilization to
proceed as long as the Sandinistas are on the offensive attack to
try to destroy them.''
   Meanwhile today, the House adopted, 379-29, a Senate-passed
resolution that condemned Ortega for canceling the cease-fire and
opposed any effort to cancel or delay national elections scheduled
for next Feb. 25.
   Ortega must ``cease his reckless rhetoric'' and Nicaragua's
leftist leaders must fulfill commitments to ``end their aggression
in the region, end their tyranny over their own people and permit
the establishment of democracy inside Nicaragua,'' the resolution
said.
   Fitzwater replied indirectly when asked if the administration
wants the Contras to remain together as a fighting force until the
Feb. 25 elections, or disband by Dec. 5 as called for in the
regional accord signed this year in Tela, Honduras.
   ``We want the Tela accords to be complied with and we are not
willing to say what might happen and speculate on those actions,
but simply to point out the reality of the situation, which is the
Sandinistas are attacking them _ what do you expect them to do?''
Fitzwater said.
   ``If they're going to go home and be killed, it's pretty hard to
ask them to do it.''
   ``Mr. Ortega has forced the situation,'' Fitzwater said of the
Nicaraguan leader's announcement that his leftist government would
no longer honor the unilateral cease-fire.
   Although President Bush and members of Congress have harshly
criticized Ortega for canceling the cease-fire, they do not appear
ready to resume military aid to the Contras, who are reported to be
re-entering Nicaragua.
   U.S. officials said Wednesday up to 1,500 Contras have crossed
the border into Nicaragua over the past month from base camps in
Honduras, bringing the guerrillas' troop strength to about 4,000.
   Ortega cited renewed rebel attacks as the reason for suspending
the cease-fire and hinted he might cancel the national elections,
saying the actions of ``Yankee Congress and the Yankee President''
will determine whether they take place.
   Later, a Nicaraguan official said that country has no plans to
cancel the elections, and Ortega insisted in a column published in
today's New York Times that the elections will be held and that the
Sandinistas will win.
   Bush lashed out at Ortega, saying, ``The man is so out of step
with the other democratic countries in this hemisphere and so
wildly insensitive to the feelings of others that we shouldn't have
been surprised'' by his action.
   ``On the other hand, I don't think he has unleashed a full-scale
offensive at this moment,'' Bush said in a radio interview with ABC
News. ``He's hedging his bets now.''
   Ortega's announcement that he was calling off the truce, reached
in March 1988, touched off high-level meetings among administration
officials and expressions of anger on Capitol Hill.
   ``Ortega is a damned fool, and he's always been a damned fool,''
said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., chairman of the House Appropriations
subcommittee with jurisdiction over aid to the Contras.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said, ``I can't conceive
of the House moving now toward providing military assistance.
That's not in the direction of the peace process.''
   Asked about prospects for renewing military aid for the rebels,
White House spokesman Fitzwater said Wednesday, ``We don't want to
go that route. We want to get free elections.''
   But some conservative supporters of the Contras began discussing
legislative language that could lead to renewal of military aid to
the Contras if the elections are canceled or delayed.
   The administration said Bush was consulting with leaders in
Central America to bring diplomatic pressure on Ortega to reverse
course.
   Ortega wrote in the Times, ``It is now clear that there is
little point in concentrating our peace efforts around the single
issue of a cease-fire. We do not consider it an acceptable
cease-fire when we cease and the Contras fire.''
   One major irritant to the administration was the seizure at the
Honduran border two weeks ago of a large quantity of weapons the
Sandinistas reportedly had earmarked for leftist rebels in El
Salvador.
   Officials said Secretary of State James A. Baker III confronted
Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin with photographs of some of the
seized equipment, including Soviet-made AK-47 rifles.
   Under a Central American peace plan, the Contras are supposed to
be disarmed and demobilized by Dec. 5. Sources said many Contras
decided to return to Nicaragua because it would be far easier for
them to escape demobilization if they were wandering undetected
inside Nicaraguan territory.
   At the same time, the rebels have asked the U.S. Agency for
International Development, which administers the current U.S.
humanitarian aid program for the Contras, for food packaged in
smaller, more easily portable quantities and for increased amounts
of cash in Nicaraguan currency, said an official familiar with the
aid program.
   AID has refused the requests, believing that to help the
reinfiltration effort would ``be a wrong signal,'' said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The administration has asked the rebels to continue to observe
the cease fire, and the Contra leadership reaffirmed Wednesday from
their Honduran base camps they would do so.
   But Ortega said the rebels have been escalating attacks against
civilians recently. Alejandro Bendana, a top Nicaraguan Foreign
Ministry official, said Wednesday night 44 civilians have been
killed by Contra forces over the past 10 days.
   Assistant Secretary of State Bernard Aronson, who appeared with
Bendana on PBS' ``McNeil-Lehrer News Hour,'' said the Sandinistas
never obeyed the cease-fire, launching a major offensive against
the Contras a month after signing it. He added that 90 Contras have
been victims of summary executions by the Sandinistas.

   The former acting administrator of the New
York regional HUD office has been reassigned to a job at
headquarters after an investigation concluded she violated the
agency's code of conduct, a spokesman says.
   HUD General Counsel Frank Keating concluded that Geraldine
McGann behaved unethically by voting on HUD-related issues as a
trustee of the village of Island Park, N.Y., according to a HUD
audit and other documents obtained under the Freedom of Information
Act. Keating pronounced the internal investigation closed.
   McGann is now working as a special assistant in HUD's Office of
Housing ``until such time as other investigations are concluded,''
HUD spokesman Jack Flynn said Wednesday. He was referring to
criminal investigations being conducted by U.S. Attorney Andrew
Maloney in New York and Nassau County District Attorney Denis
Dillon.
   ``She has no direct management role and is not involved in
funding decisions,'' Flynn said, adding that McGann continues to be
paid the same salary she made as regional administrator, $68,500 a
year.
   McGann did not immediately return a phone call Thursday seeking
comment.
   The internal investigation of McGann stemmed from her dual role
as a Department of Housing and Urban Development employee and a
trustee of the village of Island Park, Long Island. Minutes of the
Island Park board meetings show McGann voted on HUD-related
resolutions from 1982 to 1989, a violation of HUD's code of conduct.
   ``Trustees who served with Ms. McGann advised that it was her
position to abstain from voting on HUD resolutions and that the
minutes must have been drafted or recorded incorrectly,'' said an
audit completed Aug. 30 by HUD's office of inspector general.
``However, Island Park residents present at various meetings
advised that they heard Ms. McGann both vote in the affirmative and
abstain with regard to HUD-related matters.''
   She also voted to approve the village's annual budget, which
generally included HUD funds, according to the inch-thick audit. In
addition, investigators obtained a tape recording of a Nov. 17,
1988, board meeting at which McGann discussed a controversial
swimming pool that Island Park was trying to build using a $425,000
HUD grant obtained by the town's favorite son, Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato, R-N.Y.
   Island Park dropped the project after a spate of reports
ridiculing it, HUD and D'Amato for directing federal housing money
to a pool for a middle-class beachfront community.
   The latest audit reaffirms some conclusions of a January 1984
HUD audit of a federally subsidized housing program in Island Park.
That investigation found inexpensive HUD houses were being steered
to white, politically connected village residents, to the exclusion
of minorities. It also found that McGann had apparently voted on
HUD issues before the Board of Trustees, and noted that one of the
subsidized houses went to McGann's son, Daniel.
   Subsequently, Geraldine McGann told HUD investigators that the
board minutes were erroneous, and then-Village Clerk Harry Scully
sent a letter to HUD saying he had incorrectly recorded some votes.
   In 1988, McGann moved up to acting administrator of the HUD
regional office which then served New York, New Jersey and Puerto
Rico.
   But in June, The New York Times reported that Scully had
recanted the letter and was saying he had lied to protect McGann.
She was suspended as acting administrator in August. She also
resigned as trustee.

<HEAD>South Africa Won't Retract Allegations Against Namibia Guerrillas</HEAD>

   South African officials
Thursday refused to retract allegations against Namibia's black
nationalist guerrillas, despite evidence that charges of a
treaty-breaking incursion were based in part on faked radio
messages.
   President F.W. de Klerk and top members of his government
insisted the South-West Africa People Organization had plans to
disrupt elections in Namibia next week that are a step toward the
territory's independence from South Africa.
   ``SWAPO's hands are anything but clean,'' de Klerk said in a
speech.
   Foreign Minister Pik Botha said Wednesday that South Africa had
placed its troops on alert and was prepared to delay the Nov. 7-11
elections due to an alleged incursion into northern Namibia by
SWAPO guerrillas based in Angola. Botha said member of the U.N.
monitoring force reported in internal radio traffic the
infiltration of 600 guerrillas from Oct. 26-31.
   Fred Eckhard, a U.N. spokesman in Namibia, said however that the
messages ``are phony in content and format.''
   He said U.N. communications experts and military personnel
examined the information provided by South African officials and
determined that ``the messages do not emanate from any (U.N.)
source.''
   Eckhard declined to say whether the United Nations believed the
South Africans fabricated the radio messages themselves or were
victims of a hoax.
   Northern Namibia was calm Thursday, Eckhard said. U.N. soldiers
and territorial police were conducting regular patrols along the
Namibia-Angola border and had not reported any evidence of an
incursion.
   Eckhard also said the U.N. force had no evidence of SWAPO
guerrillas deploying near the Namibian border in southernmost
Angola.
   However, South Africa's armed forces chief, Gen. Jannie
Geldenhuys, and its territorial administrator in Namibia, Louis
Pienaar, both said there were large numbers of guerrillas in
southern Angola in violation of an accord requiring them to have
moved farther north.
   SWAPO's secretary for information, Hidipo Hamutanya, rejected
the South African claims, saying: ``The whole thing is a
smokescreen by South Africa to influence the outcome of the
elections.''
   Hamutenya said SWAPO had 300 guerrillas still in Angola, but
they were far north of the border and in compliance with all
international agreements.
   SWAPO maintained bases in Angola during its 23-year war against
South African rule, but is not supposed to have armed personnel
near the border or in Namibia during the transitional period.
   Under the U.N.'s independence plan, South Africa has withdrawn
virtually all of its troops from Namibia, and law enforcement
duties are being carried out by the territorial police force.
   On April 1, the official start of the transitional period, South
Africa said hundreds of SWAPO guerrillas had crossed into Namibia
from Angola in violation of international agreements. About 280
guerrillas and 27 members of the security forces were killed in
subsequent fighting, according to South Africa, which received U.N.
permission to deploy its troops against SWAPO.
   SWAPO is favored to get the most votes in the election for seats
in an assembly that will draft a constitution for Namibia, which
has been ruled by South Africa since 1915. It would need two-thirds
of the vote to have complete control over the drafting process.
   The treaty that paved the way for independence also calls for
Cuba to remove its 50,000 soldiers from Marxist-ruled Angola. Cuba
announced earlier this week that 25,000 of the troops had left on
schedule.

   Congressional negotiators reached a tentative
agreement today on a $305 billion defense bill that cuts $1.1
billion from President Bush's Strategic Defense Initiative request.
   Although lawmakers indicated that the only remaining task was
final signatures on the package by House and Senate negotiators, a
few House members still expressed their opposition to the
conference report.
   ``The deal is done,'' said Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo., a member of
the House Armed Services Committee.
   ``We have an agreement but we have to sign off,'' said Rep.
George ``Buddy'' Darden, D-Ga., another member of the House panel.
   Late Wednesday, four House Democrats criticized the conference's
plan to fund both the MX and Midgetman nuclear missiles, and said
they hoped to scuttle efforts to finish the defense bill after
nearly eight weeks of wrangling.
   ``I hope it kills the conference,'' Rep. Charles Bennett,
D-Fla., chairman of a House Armed Services subcommittee, said after
he and three other lawmakers said they could not sign the
provisional conference report.
   The compromise package, based on House and Senate bills passed
in early August, includes a $1.1 billion cut in President Bush's
request for the SDI for a Pentagon total of $3.55 billion and one
less B-2 stealth bomber than the administration sought, said
lawmakers and congressional sources who requested anonymity.
   The level of funding for SDI prompted conservative groups to
call for a presidential veto of the defense bill, saying the amount
would signal the demise of the program.
   ``This is a critical time for SDI,'' John Kwapisz, executive
director fo the Center for Peace and Freedom, told reporters.
``Where's George? He has not spoken out in support of SDI.''
   Pro-SDI groups such as Americans for the High Frontier, the
American Conservative Union and Coalitions for America said if the
president accepts an SDI level less than $3.85 billion he must
``share some of the blame with Congress for the eventual demise of
the program.''
   The defense bill includes about $1.2 billion for the MX
multiple-warhead, rail-based missile and the Midgetman
single-warhead, truck-based missile, which is equivalent to the
$1.1 billion Bush proposed for the MX and $100 million for the
Midgetman.
   The bill requires Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to cut $100
million from the $1.2 billion and gives him discretion on how to
spend the remaining amount. Cheney favored funding only the MX
missile, but Bush opted for both land-based nuclear missiles.
   That provision drew complaints from the four House members,
including three chairmen of Armed Services subcommittees.
   ``We feel that the proposed deal on the B-2, Strategic Defense
Initiative and mobile ICBM's is inadequate and we cannot sign the
conference report in its present form,'' the four said in a letter
to Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the Armed Services panel.
   ``A real opportunity to assert leadership would be lost unless
we eliminate funding for one of the two mobile ICBM's. This could
be achieved by eliminating the Midgetman,'' the lawmakers said.
   Signing the letter were Bennett, chairman of the House Armed
Services subcommittee on seapower and strategic and critical
materials; Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., chairman of the
subcommittee on military installations and facilities; Ronald
Dellums, D-Calif., chairman of the subcommittee on research and
development; and Lane Evans, D-Ill., a member of the full panel.
   Questioned about the letter, Bennett said supporters of the
Midgetman tout it as a key bargaining chip in U.S.-Soviet
negotiations to reduce strategic weapons. But the Florida Democrat
scoffed at the idea of ``spending millions of dollars on a
bargaining chip.''

   A pilots association representative said
today he has questions about the significance of a serial number
mixup in a flawed engine fan disk installed in a DC-10 that
crashed, killing 112 people.
   ``I don't think the records exist properly to answer that
question right now,'' D.B. Robinson, an accident investigator for
the pilots union, said during a break in a National Transportation
Safety Board hearing on the accident.
   A rear engine fan disk that split apart in midair is being
blamed for the crash of United Flight 232 as it made an emergency
landing at Sioux City's airport July 19.
   A more detailed test than one conducted before the crash would
have detected the faulty part, an engineer told federal
investigators.
   A crack in the disk probably existed when the disk was last
inspected in February 1988, said Chris Glynn, a design engineer for
General Electric Co., which manufactured the engine.
   James Tucker, general manager of product operations for GE's
airplane engine plant in Evendale, Ohio, acknowledged Wednesday the
company unwittingly listed two new engine fan disks under the same
serial number in 1971. One of the disks was to be destroyed because
tests showed it might be faulty; the second was to be sent on for
installation in a DC-10.
   Company officials were unaware of the double bookkeeping entry
when they pulled records on engine fan disk 00385, the serial
number of the disk that split in midair.
   But Tucker said company officials are certain the faulty disk
with the same serial number was destroyed in 1972 and did not wind
up in the rear engine of United Flight 232.
   ``There's no way that this ... could have been assembled in that
engine,'' he told NTSB officials at the four-day hearing that
concludes Friday.
   Robinson, however, said he wasn't convinced.
   ``I'm not satisfied, but I'm not dissatisfied either,'' he said.
``The board will discover what's going on. It will be resolved.''
   Ultrasonic testing in February 1988 probably would have led to
the engine's recall, Glynn told the NTSB at the hearing Wednesday.
   United spokesman Robert Doughty said that since the crash, the
Federal Aviation Administration has ordered more detailed
inspections involving ultrasonic examination of all disks similar
to the titanium disk that split apart near the tail of the plane.
   Such testing can detect cracks and other flaws beneath the
surface in a block of material. Before the crash, surface testing
of disks was deemed adequate.
   ``If the ultrasonic testing had been required, it (the crack)
would have been discovered,'' Doughty said during a break in
testimony.
   The crash occurred as the crippled plane was brought in for an
emergency landing at the Sioux City airport after its rear engine
exploded in over northwest Iowa. The explosion severed the plane's
three hydraulic lines, rendering the aircraft virtually
unmanageable.
   The rear engine's huge fan disk was found in two sections in
northwest Iowa farm fields. Initial testing has found a crack
measuring one-half inch deep and more than an inch long in the
larger section of the disk, according to an NTSB report.

<HEAD>Nevada Nuclear Tests Safe, Congressional Study Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   There is no evidence to show that underground
nuclear tests in Nevada jeopardize the health of nearby residents,
although radioactive materials have periodically been released by
the blasts, a congressional study concludes.
   The report by Congress' Office of Technology Assessment said
that since 1970 the underground tests have released about 54,000
curies of radiation, an amount the study said would give a resident
living near the test site all that time about the same exposure to
radiation as a single X-ray.
   The report, released this week, said there is no need to improve
radiation containment procedures in connection with the tests, but
it suggested that the government abandon its practice of keeping
such tests secret.
   ``The secrecy associated with the program is largely
ineffective,'' the report said, adding that public concern about
such tests could be reduced if citizens were told of the tests. For
the most part, word of the tests becomes publicly available anyway
because workers are evacuated from the test site and the
underground explosions are detected from seismic signals.
   The study had been requested by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who
said the findings demonstrate that ``no significant health risks
are likely to result'' from the underground tests at the Nevada
Test Site.
   More than a dozen nuclear weapons are detonated underground each
year at the Nevada site. The tests are used to develop new weapons
and assess the effects of nuclear explosions on military equipment.
   The congressional study said elaborate efforts are made to
prevent radiation from being released. The 54,000 curies released
from 126 tests since 1970 compares to more than 12 billion curies
of radiation that were released in tests prior to 1970, the report
said.
   The report noted concerns among some Nevada citizens over
whether some areas of the test site such as the Rainier Mesa are
strong enough to contain the underground radiation. Ground cracks
have been found on the mesa near where tests were conducted.
   But the OTA study said the cracks do not indicate a greater
possiblity of radiation leaks. It said tests on the mesa are
conducted deeper than similar tests at Yucca Flat and that drill
samples near the cracks show no weakening of rock strength because
the cracks do not extend down to the test region.

   Radicals plan an outpouring of hatred
Saturday to mark the day the U.S. Embassy was seized in 1979, and
some diplomats view the plans as a challenge to President Hashemi
Rafsanjani's more moderate faction.
   Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, a hard-liner Rafsanjani dropped as
interior minister, will address a rally outside the former embassy
building, which militants stormed Nov. 4, 1979. He is the
president's main rival and has close links to Shiite Moslem
fundamentalists holding Western hostages in Lebanon.
   It will be the first public appearance by Mohtashemi, 43, since
he was pushed out Rafsanjani, who formed his government in August
and leads the ``pragmatists'' who seek to end Iran's isolation.
   Radicals have whipped up anti-American passion for days,
undermining what had appeared to be a government attempt at
moderation on the 10th anniversary of the beginning of 444 days in
captivity for 52 Americans.
   Workers strung scores of cloth banners Thursday between the
maple trees lining Taleghani, a broad avenue that runs past the
embassy's main entrance.
   Among the inscriptions were ``No relations with the United
States'' and ``Strike down global arrogance to protect the Islamic
revolution.''
   Promoters call Saturday's anniversary ``the national day of
struggle with global arrogance and the world-devouring United
States.'' Global arrogance, like ``The Great Satan,'' has become a
synonym for the United States.
   Rafsanjani is trying to revive the moribund economy after a
truce last year in the eight-year war with Iraq and has sought
better relations with the West, in part to secure help with a
rebuilding program estimated to cost $400 billion.
   Revolutionary hard-liners fear opening up to the world will
dilute the ideological purity of the fundamentalist revolution
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini led from the takeover of Iran in
February 1979 until his death June 3.
   Rumors had spread that Mohtashemi was under house arrest, but he
turned up in Lebanon last month, meeting with Shiite leaders. The
reason for his visit was not clear, but speculation arose that it
concerned the 18 Western hostages, who include eight Americans.
   Since becoming president, Rafsanjani has made tentative offers
to help obtain their release if the United States met certain
conditions.
   Diplomats consider the radical attempt to make Saturday's
anniversary a show of anti-Americanism ``a kind of showdown with
the pragmatists.''
   That theory was bolstered Wednesday when the Majlis, Iran's
parliament, enacted a law empowering the government to arrest
Americans anywhere in the world for offending Iran and bring them
to Tehran for trial.
   Officials said the bill responded to a U.S. Justice Department
ruling months ago allowing the FBI to arrest terrorism suspects in
other countries without prior approval of the governments involved.
The ruling contained no reference to Iran.
   Why the response took so long was not clear, but the bill's
swift introduction and passage neatly coincided with the
anniversary.
   Militants who seized the embassy compound in downtown Tehran
apparently had Khomeini's blessing. The crisis, including a rescue
attempt that came to disaster in the desert south of Tehran,
crippled President Jimmy Carter's administration and helped cost
him the 1980 election.
   Assadollah Bayat, the radical deputy speaker of parliament,
declared Thursday that Iran never will resume the relations broken
by the United States after the embassy seizure.
   ``The United States has adopted a hostile, brutal and inhuman
attitude against Iran after the success of the Islamic
revolution,'' he declared.
   Echoing a speech Wednesday by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the
supreme political and spiritual leader, Bayat exhorted Iranians to
``wage perpetual struggle against arrogant powers headed by the
United States.''
   By contrast, Rafsanjani said last week that Washington had sent
messages to Iran through two neighboring countries, presumably
Pakistan and Turkey, seeking better relations.
   He avoided outright rejection of the overture, saying: ``We
still have no confidence in what they say. We ask for signs and
indications of goodwill on their part.''
   Officials said demonstrators would burn 160 American flags
Saturday, 10 for each of 16 Shiites beheaded in Saudi Arabia in
September for bombings in the holy city of Mecca during this year's
annual Moslem pilgrimage. The bombs killed one man and wounded 16.
   The day's events will begin with a news conference in the former
embassy compound at which Iranians said to have spied for the
United States will be put on display.

<HEAD>New US Policy to Be Set on East European Refugees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bush administration officials told Congress
Thursday the proportion of refugees coming to the United States
from East European countries other than Poland and Hungary likely
will rise under an expected new policy based on the danger of
persecution.
   Princeton N. Lyman, director of the State Department's Bureau
for Refugee Programs, testified that the administration policy is
undergoing a review that should be completed in a few weeks.
   He spoke before the House Judiciary Committee's Immigration
Subcommittee at a hearing on the question of refugees from Eastern
Europe _ but not including the Soviet Union.
   Administration witnesses testified that the governments of
Poland and Hungary are becoming more liberal, so that the danger of
persecution there is receding, while that is not the case in
Czechoslovakia and Romania.
   Of 25,000 East Europeans waiting in West European camps in the
hope of coming to the United States, about 80 percent come from
Poland and Hungary. But more refugees from Romania are now
appearing in Western Europe, and also in Hungary.
   One possibility being considered is help for some of those Poles
and Hungarians to return home, said Lyman.
   ``We have to be fair to the 25,000 who have been waiting, some
of them for a long time,'' he said. ``We have to look at
repatriation.''
   Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, suggested that the United States work
with France and West Germany to help such Poles and Hungarians. She
said they would not be accepted easily back home.
   Rep. Bruce A. Morrison, D-Conn, who chaired the hearing, said
that these are just the kind of people Americans would like to see
back in their own countries, working for more democracy.
   ``A little international help would go a long way,'' he said.
   Lyman also pointed out that few East Germans seek to come to the
United States; the overwhelming majority leaving their country go
to West Germany.
   He predicted a rise in the proportion of refugees from countries
where there is a real fear of persecution.
   ``One dilemma we face is the danger that the very existence of a
continuing U.S. refugee admissions program for Poles and Hungarians
will act as a magnet, drawing more people into Austria and other
Western European countries,'' he said.
   For the year that began Oct. 1, the United States will accept
50,000 refugees from the Soviet Union and 6,500 from other
countries in Eastern Europe.
   Nancy R. Kingsbury of the congressional General Accounting
Office testified that only 1,500 places out of the 6,500 will are
still available. The other 5,000 have already been assigned to
people approved last year for admittance to the United States.
   Rep. William O. Lipinski, D-Ill., urged that the number for the
whole area, including the Soviet Union, be raised to 100,000 a year
for 10 years.
   ``Given their qualifications. as well as a forthcoming American
labor shortage, the United States would benefit tremendously from
increased immigration,'' he said.

   A man chasing a driver in anger after she
knocked down signs in front of his home pulled her from her
disabled car seconds before it was demolished by a train, police
said.
   ``It's funny. At first I was mad at this girl when she hit those
signs in front of our house,'' Thomas Saunders said. ``But when she
got stuck on the tracks, I didn't even remember what I was mad
about. All I could think of was she needed help.''
   ``I actually got into my car with the purpose of chasing her
down to get her license plate number,'' said Saunders, 19, of
Cleveland.
   Jennifer Johnson, 17, of Painesville was going westbound on a
city street when she turned the car and tried to drive across
Conrail tracks.
   Police said a wheel of her car became lodged in the tracks.
   Saunders said he tried unsuccessfully to push her car with his.
   As the train approached, Saunders said he yelled at Ms. Johnson
to leave her car.
   ``As the train was approaching, the driver blew his horn, and
she got hysterical,'' he said. ``I opened up her car door and
pulled her out just before the train demolished the car.''
   Police said she had not been cited for traffic violations, but
an investigation was continuing.

   The government, divided over Britain's increasing
isolation in Europe, on Thursday unveiled an alternative go-slow
approach to plans for European monetary union.
   Earlier, rumors of an alleged insider-trading scandal involving
a Cabinet minister shook the London stock market. Transport
Secretary Cecil Parkinson denied speculation he was involved and
the markets steadied.
   But the jittery reaction reflected edginess about the
government, already shaken by last week's resignation of the top
treasury official, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson. He
quit in a policy dispute with Prgaret Thatcher over
Europe.
   The new chancellor, John Major, issued a government paper laying
down what he termed Britain's ``market-based'' approach to the
developmentrime Minister Ma of economic and monetary union among the 12
nations of
the EEC.
   The British plan said it was ``far too early'' to commit the EEC
to having a single currency and central bank envisioned in the
current plan, drawn up by Jacques Delors, head of the European
Commission at the Community's headquarters in Brussels.
   French President Francois Mitterrand, president of the 12-nation
EEC, is pressing the Delors plan.
   Last month, Mitterrand went further and said econoshows you can achieve
closer economic and monetary
cooperation much better and more rapidly by working with the grain
of market forces than by setting up new bureaucratic and highly
centralized institutions which are not accountable to anybody,''
she added.
   Mrs. Thatcher in June rejected the single central bank and
one-currency notions as removing from national governments
fundamental powers to decide on economic policy.
   Mrs. Thatcher agreed, however, on strict conditions that Britain
will in principle join the currency-stabilizing mechanism of the
European Monetary System that links nine of the EEC currencies.
   But she is unenthusiastic about the idea, while Lawson wanted to
join as soon as possible. He quit saying he could no longer carry
on while Mrs. Thatcher retained a personal economic adviser who
opposes British membership. The adviser then also resigned.
   London share prices tumbled in early trading after rumors swept
the market that another Cabinet minister was likely to resign in
the alleged insider-dealing scandal.
   After several hours of speculation that Parkinson was the
minister, he issued a statement through his lawyers saying he has
not ``engaged in any insider dealing nor in any share dealings.''
   The statement added that Parkinson transferred his funds to
stockbrokers after he joined the Cabinet in 1987 and had since
``played no part whatsoever'' in any investments the brokers made.
   The rumors began after The Scotsman, a newspaper based in
Edinburgh, reported that Britain's Channel 4 television network has
investigated an insider-dealing group that allegedly has at least
one senior government member among its clients.
   Channel 4 confirmed it is working on an investigation but said
the program was ``as yet neither complete nor scheduled.''
   Insider trading is the illegal attempt to profit by buying and
selling stock based on inside information about a company, such as
takeover offers or profits prospects, which is not available to the
public.

   Criminal charges in a post office procurement
case should be dismissed, defense lawyers argued Thursday,
contending prosecutors unfairly manipulated grand jury witnesses to
obtain an indictment against a Texas company.
   Midway through a criminal trial, attorneys for Recognition
Equipment Inc. and two of its top executives moved for the case to
be thrown out because the government showed its star witness
previous grand jury testimony.
   Government investigators were ``threatening'' executive
recruiter William Spartin ``and then poisoning his recollections
through unlawful exposure to the Grand Jury testimony of others,''
defense attorneys said in a 69-page court filing.
   Dallas-based REI and executives William Moore and Robert Reedy
are accused of conspiring to corrupt the federal procurement
process in 1985 in an attempt to win a $250 million contract to
build mail-sorting equipment.
   At the urging of Peter Voss, then vice chairman of the postal
board of governors, REI hired a consulting firm owned by John Gnau
and of which Spartin was president. Gnau then made illegal payoffs
to Voss in a scheme to which both men have pleaded guilty and have
been sent to prison. Spartin has been granted immunity from
prosecution.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Valder showed Spartin summary
statements of previous grand jury witnesses, making it impossible
for Spartin to distinguish between what he knew and what he had
read, the defense attorneys said.
   The grand jury that indicted REI was never told that the five
main witnesses in the case were unable to implicate the company in
payoffs to Voss, according to defense attorneys.
   Spartin says that as far as he knew, REI was never told that
Gnau was paying Voss, but he never was permitted to tell that to
the grand jury, according to testimony at the trial.
   Instead, Spartin was asked by prosecutors in front of the grand
jury whether he had concluded that REI must have known about the
illegal payoffs.
   Spartin, who had been shown statements from other grand jury
witnesses, said his opinion was that REI must have been aware of
them.
   After Spartin told investigators he wasn't aware that REI had
ever been told of the payoffs, Valder tore up Spartin's immunity
agreement, according to testimony at the trial, which began Sept.
28. Investigators threatened to seek charges against Spartin's son
for obstruction of justice in the scandal.
   ``Everybody is beating me up on this issue,'' Spartin complained
in 1986 during one of his two polygraph examinations on the
question of whether he knew if REI had been told of the payoffs to
Voss.
   ``The (Postal) Inspector, the U.S. Attorney ... what they tried
to tell me was, `look Spartin, you're in deep trouble,''' Spartin
said to the polygraph examiner, who at the end of the exam
identified himself as a postal inspector.
   Spartin told the polygraph examiner that investigators were
telling him, ``You've lied to us. We (are) going to subpoena your
son. We are going to charge him with obstruction of justice.''
Spartin's son wasn't charged.
   When the polygraph examiner asked Spartin whether he would tell
if he ``knew something on REI,'' Spartin replied:
   ``Boy would I tell you, I got nothing to lose ... but I can't
make up a story.''

   Troops loyal to the leftist Sandinista
government attacked U.S.-backed Contra guerrillas just hours after
President Daniel Ortega ended a 19-month truce, a military
spokeswoman said today.
   But the spokeswoman, Lt. Col. Rosa Pasos, denied that any
large-scale operations were involved, and said most of the action
was concentrated on rebels sneaking into Nicaragua from neighboring
Honduras.
   ``These are military operations against mercenary forces that
have been infiltrating,'' she added.
   Pasos said most of the action is concentrated in the regions
where the bulk of an estimated 2,500 Contras are scattered.
   Pasos also confirmed a report by the Sandinista National
Liberation Front newspaper Barricada that an army company backed by
militias mounted the first attack against a group of about 30
Contras in the area around Quilali.
   She said the attack took place Wednesday, about two hours after
Ortega announced he would not renew the cease-fire, but refused to
pinpoint the area. She said she did not have immediate reports of
casualties.
   Barricada said today that combat units in 14 towns and villages
in northern Nicaragua began operations overnight against the
rebels, but gave few details.
   Opposition leaders have been accusing Ortega of canceling the
cease-fire because he feared holding free elections.
   A rebel communique said: ``The breaking of the cease-fire by the
Sandinista army is already in effect because the Nicaraguan
military today intensified its attacks against our forces and
positions through widespread operations.''
   The communique, distributed by the rebels' Nicaraguan Resistance
organization in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, said the leftist government
was mounting attacks Wednesday with tanks, helicopter gunships and
heavy artillery.
   Ortega announced at news conference broadcast live to the nation
early in the day that he was suspending the unilateral cease-fire.
   He said more than 1,100 rebels had infiltrated Nicaragua through
the Honduran border during the past three weeks and that rebel
attacks had ``increased dramatically.''
   Later, the Defense Ministry said Contras killed eight people and
wounded 14 in three attacks in the northern provinces of Matagalpa
and Jinotega from Sunday to Tuesday. Three of the dead were
civilians who were kidnapped then killed, a ministry communique
said.
   In an opinion piece in today's New York Times, Ortega contended
the Contras were trying to subvert the electoral process because
``they are as convinced as I am ... that the Nicaraguan people will
give the Sandinistas a landslide victory'' in elections planned for
Feb. 25.
   He said that during October, Contra units closed more than 50
voter registration centers, preventing thousands of citizens from
registering.
   ``They targeted for assassination known Sandinista supporters _
prominent community leaders, party activists and candidates for
municipal offices _ and slit their throats,'' Ortega wrote.
   The rebel high command said Sandinista troops, using heavy
artillery and backed by Soviet-made helicopters, attacked Wednesday
in La Sirena and Batitan, in the southern Atlantic coast province
of Zelaya.
   Interior Ministry troops made ``continuous attacks'' on rebels
at Sarawaca Hill in the northern province of Jinotega, at the
border with Honduras, the Tegucigalpa communique said.
   Alfredo Cesar, a former director of the Nicaraguan Resistance,
said he believed Ortega's decision to end the truce confirmed a
thesis of President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica.
   ``The thesis is that the Sandinista Front is afraid of peace,''
Cesar said, ``that the Sandinista Front prefers war and is afraid
of the political process in general.''
   Cesar ended seven years of exile and returned to Nicaragua
earlier this year to join in the electoral process. He is now a
leading voice within the Sandinistas' main challenger, the 14-party
coalition National Opposition Union.
   The coalition's vice presidential candidate, Virgilio Godoy,
said the government's decision to suspend the cease-fire ``has
little to do with the military situation and much to do with the
electoral situation.''
   Ortega has said whether elections are held will depend on
whether President Bush and Congress agree to push for
demobilization of the Contras.
   He called for meetings next week at the United Nations so
agreement can be reached on a mechanism for dismantling the
Contras, who are based in Honduras.
   Ortega and four other Central American presidents agreed Aug. 7
to demobilize and relocate the rebels by Dec. 5. At the time, about
12,000 rebels were in the Honduras camps.
   Before announcing the recent infiltration of 1,100 rebels into
Nicaragua, officials had said 2,000 to 3,000 rebels were in the
country.
   Ortega contends the Contras have routinely violated the truce
since it was signed in March 1988, a month after Congress suspended
military aid to the rebels.
   He has said that in the 19 months since, Contra attacks in
Nicaragua have killed more than 730 people and wounded more than
1,000, mostly civilians.
   The non-lethal aid package Congress approved for the Contras in
March includes a clause providing for the suspension of aid should
the Contras initiate attacks in Nicaragua.
   The aid, which includes food, medicine, boots and uniforms, is
to run out just after the elections.

   Federal officials jousted Thursday over a
congressional proposal to reallocate government radio airspace to
private uses such as mobile phones, pagers and satellites and to
assure room for new technologies such as high-definition television.
   Janice Obuchowski, who heads a Commerce Department agency that
oversees government radio use, warned of the costs and potential
disruption to military and emergency communications and air traffic
control if federal users relinquish frequencies as proposed in a
bill by Reps. John Dingell, D-Mich., and Edward Markey, D-Mass.
   ``There is no fresh and virgin spectrum, and there will be some
user displacement,'' Obuchowski told the House Energy and Commerce
subcommittee on telecommunications and finance. She said the Bush
administration opposes the bill.
   But Alfred Sikes, chairman of the Federal Communications
Commission, which regulates the commercial radio sector, said the
government, if forced to do so, can find ways to turn over parts of
its spectrum to the private sector.
   However, he acknowledged that reallocation could be costly.
   American technology so far has made major advances in squeezing
more information onto the airwaves, but there are limits to such
advances, Sikes said.
   ``Some believe that we have reached theoreticl limits,
particularly when cost-effectiveness factors are taken into
account,'' Sikes said. ``In all likelihood, we will have to both
move toward new generations of equipment _ at a significant cost _
and find more spectrum.''
   Sikes said it was important to America's international
communications competitiveness that the radio industry, which
generates more than $100 billion in revenues annually, be able to
grow.
   Obuchowski urged Congress not to act before completion late next
year of a spectrum-use study by the National Telecommunications and
Information Administration, which she heads.
   But Dingell and Markey told the hearing it was essential to move
quickly. Dingell said that as the United States ``sits soundly
asleep,'' Europe and Japan are making great communications advances.
   Markey said Congress had not held a hearing on spectrum use
since 1959 and that ``technicians,'' not policymakers, had been
making allocation decisions.
   ``As a nation, we should not be fretting over choosing between
new important technologies such as (high-definition television) and
microcell communications and important community needs such as
mobile communications for public safety.''

   A judge suspended a 126-day jail sentence for
Cyndy Garvey, the former wife of former Dodgers star Steve Garvey
who spent one night in jail last month for violating a child
visitation order.
   Superior Court Judge Frances Rothschild on Wednesday reinstated
probation for Ms. Garvey, saying she would make a final ruling on
the sentence at a Dec. 8 hearing.
   Ms. Garvey was found guilty last month of 42 counts of contempt
for willfully violating a court order that permitted Garvey to
visit his daughters, 14-year-old Krisha and 13-year-old Whitney.
   Garvey in October also was granted joint custody of the girls,
who live with their mother in Malibu. The former first baseman for
the Dodgers and the San Diego Padres also lives in Malibu, with his
second wife.
   Neither Ms. Garvey nor her ex-husband would comment on
Wednesday's ruling.

   Singer-songwriter Roger Miller said he's
eager to get started on another play after his award-winning
success with the Broadway musical ``Big River.''
   He hopes to begin work in January on music and lyrics although
he and his producers have yet to choose a subject.
   ``We're searching for something with a western theme, but it
could end up being about almost anything,'' Miller said in an
interview published Thursday in the Nashville Banner.
   ``Big River,'' which was about Huck Finn, won seven Tony Awards.
Miller wrote the music and lyrics and received a Tony in 1985 for
best score.
   ``It's been four years,'' Miller said. ``I'm anxious to do it
again. It stretches the mind. It's good to reach in there under the
layers and find out what would be thrilling on stage.''
   Miller launched his career with country music hits that include
``King of the Road'' and ``Dang Me.''

   Prince Charles and Princess Diana flew to Jakarta
on Thursday on the first leg of a tour of Indonesia and Hong Kong.
   The visit replaces a planned trip to China that was canceled
after the government crackdown on student demonstrations in June in
which hundreds, perhaps thousands, died.
   The royal couple accepted President Suharto's invitation to
visit Indonesia almost two years ago, although no date was
scheduled at that time.
   During their stay in Indonesia, the princess will visit a
hospital in Jakarta to see pioneering work in the rehabilitation of
people suffering from leprosy. The prince will visit the restored
Borobudur Temple, one of Indonesia's national symbols, and inspect
a reforestation project at Wanagama.
   Their visit to Hong Kong is being seen as a means of restoring
confidence in the British colony less than eight years before it is
handed back to Chinese rule.

   Because there are few written scores of Indian music, most of it
is passed on personally from teacher to student, Khan said.

   East Germany's Egon Krenz said after
meeting Thursday with Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki that it was
a ``good experience'' and the two new leaders could learn from each
other.
   Krenz, a Communist Party hard-liner, emerged smiling from the
talks with Mazowiecki, a longtime Solidarity activist and former
political prisoner.
   ``We had a very good talk. We touched all subjects that concern
the German Democratic Republic and the Peoples' Republic of Poland.
It was naturally a new experience for me to speak with the prime
minister,'' Krenz said after the nearly one-hour meeting with
Mazowiecki.
   ``We spoke openly with each other and those who speak openly
with each other quickly find a way to solve all complicated and
uncomplicated problems,'' he added.
   Krenz said they discussed economic cooperation, the political
relationship between the two countries and international issues.
   Mazowiecki said there was a good atmosphere during the meeting.
``I think our conversation was open, clear and made a tour of our
problems.''
   Krenz, in power only two weeks and facing popular pressure at
home for Solidarity-style reforms, also met with President Wojciech
Jaruzelski and with Communist Party First Secretary Mieczyslaw F.
Rakowski.
   Asked what Polish experiences he could use in East Germany,
Krenz replied: ``I have only been here a few hours so I can't say
concretely yet. But, nevertheless, I said we learn from each
other.''
   But he denied taking any advice from Mazowiecki, who became
prime minister in August. ``The prime minister is such a pleasant
man that he didn't make any recommendations,'' Krenz said.
   ``He told me how one should judge things, but we did not give
each other recommendations.
   ``I hope we will have not only good, neighborly relations, but
friendship as well,'' Krenz said. ``We have had good traditions and
I think we can continue those.''
   Krenz said earlier at the airport that it was a ``great
pleasure'' for him to meet Mazowiecki, the East bloc's first
non-communist head of government.
   ``It is a new experience for me, but I think something good can
come out of this experience for East Germany,'' he said.

   If 70 roaming buffaloes don't get
people's attention, farmer ``Duke'' Hasselbring hopes his bumper
sticker will: ``WARNING: Buffalo meat may improve your sex life.''
   It also may not, he chuckles, but in this business it pays to be
flamboyant.
   It also helps to be real fast on your feet, said Hasselbring,
one of the nation's estimated 300 commercial buffalo producers.
   Unlike cattle, Hasselbring said buffalo are dumb, high-strung,
have no respect for people, charge without provocation, and can run
35 mph.
   ``We three do a lot of roadwork, so we can do 36 (mph) and stay
one step ahead of them,'' said Hasselbring. ``They paw the ground
and that doesn't mean anything, but when they raise that tail,
you've got about five seconds to clear out.''
   Hasselbring brings school children to his farm to educate them
about buffaloes, sends buffalo steaks to members of the Chicago
Bears football team, and plans to provide buffalo samples at a food
fair to attract restaurant owners.
   Kim Dowling, editor of the National Buffalo Association's
magazine, called buffalo meat ``America's original health food''
because it is low in fat and high in protein.
   Hasselbring, a cattleman and award-winning corn grower, got into
the buffalo business after his son, Kenton, wrote a paper about it
for a college entrepreneurship class. Kenton and brother Robin now
work with their father on the 1,800-acre farm in east-central
Illinois.

   In what promises to herald a new era
for hors d'oeuvres, researchers have developed tomatoes that are
half the size of cherry tomatoes.
   No more cutting them up and getting squirted with the seeds _
you just sprinkle them on your salad like croutons.
   The University of Florida reported Wednesday that two Institute
of Food and Agricultural Sciences researchers developed tomato
plants that stand 5 to 8 inches tall and produce the itty-bitty
``Micro-Tom'' tomatoes.
   ``There's nothing like it,'' said Dr. Jay Scott, who spent seven
years developing the tomato with Dr. Brent Harbaugh. ``It
establishes a whole new category for small tomato varieties. We
call it a miniature dwarf tomato.''
   An average tomato plant is 20 times larger than Micro-Tom, which
was bred for convenience and as an ornamental for window sill pots,
hanging baskets and in garden borders. Micro-Tom is about
one-quarter the size of the next smallest varieties, said Scott.
   Micro-Tom's tiny tomatoes also taste good, according to 75
people who sampled the fruit in informal taste tests, Scott said.
But Scott and Harbaugh note that seeds for Micro-Tom are not yet
available and probably won't be released to the public until
sometime next year.
   ``Micro-Tom is so intriguing because all the parts of the tomato
plant have been genetically reduced in size,'' Scott said. Other
dwarf tomato plants are short, but their leaves are still
comparatively large relative to the rest of the plant, said Scott.
   Scott and Harbaugh cross-bred a dwarf Florida tomato variety,
called Florida Basket, with an Ohio breed that had small leaves and
fruit to develop the pedigree for Micro-Tom.

   Police found 25 bodies in the remote
eastern town of Bhagalpur on Thursday, the scene of sectarian
violence between Hindus and Moslems last week, news reports said.
   Press Trust of India said the discovieries raised the death toll
in the fighting to 190. There have been no reports of violence for
the past two days, the news agency said, quoting government
officials in Patna, the capital of Bihar state.
   Bhagalpur is 110 miles east of Patna and 635 miles southeast of
New Delhi. The army has been called out to maintain peace in the
town and surrounding areas and a curfew is in force.
   Mob violence broke out in Bhagalpur and four nearby village on
Oct. 24 after Hindu fundamentalists organized processions
celebrating the building of a temple at a spot in neighboring Uttar
Pradesh state, which both religious groups claim as sacred.
   Indian news media rarely identify the perpetrators or the
victims of sectarian violence.
   Press Trust said decomposed bodies could be seen on the street
of at least one of the villages and that occasional gunshots were
heard. Many residents were living in camps because their houses
were burned in the violence and the streets were deserted even when
curfew was lifted for two hours, it said.
   Moslems form 12 percent of the country's 880 million people.
Hindus make up 80 percent.

   Air pollution soared to dangerous levels
in Athens on Thursday, prompting the government to shut down
schools, ban cars from downtown and order industries to cut in half
their use of fuel.
   The National First Aid Center reported that by noon Thursday, 15
people had been hospitalized due to the air conditions _ nine
people with heart problems exacerbated by the smog and six with
respiratory problems.
   The Education Ministry ordered all schools in the Athens area to
close Thursday and Friday in an unprecedented move to protect
students and reduce traffic.
   The Environment Ministry banned all private motor vehicles from
the city center between 7 p.m. Thursday and 5 p.m. Friday. In the
area outside the commercial center, only those with license plates
ending in even numbers were allowed.
   Thousands of office workers had to abandon their cars in the
city, and only half of Athens' 14,000 taxi cabs were permitted to
enter downtown.
   Industries in the Athens area were ordered to halve fuel
consumption as part of the emergency action, and smelting works and
furnaces were shut down.
   The weather bureau predicted that the unusually warm and
windless autumn weather would continue until Sunday, threatening to
raise pollution levels even higher.
   The Attica coastal basin, in which Athens is situated, is home
to more than one-third of Greece's 10 million inhabitants and has a
population density of more than 14,000 people per square mile,
according to the last census in 1981.
   Air pollution has become a serious problem, reaching emergency
levels whenever high temperatures and still weather trap smog
within the mountains that circle the city.
   In September 1982, the government banned half of the capital's
estimated 800,000 private automobiles from central Athens during
office hours. Vehicles are allowed into the restricted zone on
alternate days, depending on the last number of their license
plates.

<TEXT>
   More than 1,300 young East Germans
jammed the West German Embassy on Thursday to seek new lives in the
West, and many scoffed at promised reforms in the communist
homeland they left behind.
   In East Berlin, Communist leader Egon Krenz urged closer
economic ties to the West and said a new law permitting freedom of
travel to the West would be announced Monday. Several top Communist
officials resigned, including the wife of ousted leader Erich
Honecker.
   At least 8,000 East Germans swarmed into Czechoslovakia after
East Germany lifted a month-old travel ban on Wednesday, the
official East German news agency ADN said. It is the only country
East Germans can visit freely.
   Most of those flooding into the embassy in Prague were in their
early 20s. At least 200 to 300 children could be seen behind a
fence playing peacefully in the embassy grounds.
   ``We want reforms without borders,'' said one of the new
arrivals, a 24-year-old trucker from Leipzig.
   ``I don't believe that anything will change there,'' said
another young man who declined to give his name. ``The reforms are
only for the outside world.''
   As darkness shrouded the embassy, East Germans continued to
arrive, with at least 20 people gaining entry in just one 15-minute
spell.
   The refugees simply walked in through the giant wooden doors of
the Palais Lobkowicz, the elegant Baroque palace that houses the
West German Embassy in Prague's ancient Mala Strana district.
   A Czech policeman outside the embassy said he and his colleagues
had orders not to interfere with any East Germans seeking entrance
because this was a matter for the two Germanys alone.
   Several refugees chatted with reporters through the railings of
the embassy garden, some sipping beer and listening to music.
Others waved from upper-floor windows in the embassy.
   Shipments of tents were ordered from West Germany to cope with
what embassy sources expected would be a renewed influx over the
weekend. West German Red Cross helpers and medical supplies were
dispatched from Bonn.
   East Germany has agreed to allow East Germans at the embassy and
at the West German Embassy in Warsaw to renounce their citizenship
and go to West Germany, which automatically gives them a new
passport and assistance in starting a new life.
   East German diplomats are processing only about 100 people a day
in Prague, and more than 1,000 are still waiting in the West German
Embassy in Warsaw.
   East German Ambassador Helmut Ziebart urged his countrymen to
seek legal emigration in East Germany, rather than go through other
countries. But many complained that it takes years for such
requests to be granted.
   West German coaches were used to ferry the processed East
Germans to the Czech border with Bavaria at Waidhaus. Some East
Germans who boarded a bus Thursday appeared rather drunk, witnesses
said.
   Czechoslovakia's normally conservative state-run media, which
gave only scant reports on the exodus of 15,000 East Germans
through Prague last month, swiftly reported the latest arrivals.
   More than 70,000 East Germans have fled their homeland through
Hungary and Bonn's embassies in Prague and Warsaw since August.
   On Oct. 3, Honecker banned travel to Czechoslovakia to try to
halt the mass emigration of young, skilled workers badly needed in
his labor-intensive economy.
   But the exodus and pressure for reform led to Honecker's ouster
Oct. 18. Krenz, who is trying to bolster the Communist Party's
sagging authority with promises of reform and foreign travel,
lifted the ban.
   Krenz faces mounting pressure for Solidarity-style reforms in
East Germany, where tens of thousands have repeatedly taken to the
streets to press for more democracy.
   On Thursday in Warsaw, he discussed reforms with Poland's
Solidarity Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the first
non-communist premier in the East bloc. Back in East Berlin, he
told reporters he wanted closer ties with the European Economic
Community and called for a quick trade agreement.
   Krenz spoke after talks with Martin Bangemann, an EEC
commissioner from West Germany. Bangemann said he was told by Krenz
that a new law permitting freedom of travel to the West would be
announced on Monday.
   Two regional Communist Party bosses were replaced, the chief of
the Communist-controlled trade unions federation stepped down and
the leader of a Communist-allied political party resigned, ADN
reported.
   The resignation of Margot Honecker as education minister was
announced by the state-run news agency ADN following a cabinet
meeting. Mrs. Honecker, 62, had held the post since 1963.

   The Senate closed its doors Thursday to debate
the case of Judge Walter L. Nixon of Mississippi in the second
impeachment trial to come to the floor in the last two weeks.
   Lawmakers were expected to vote Friday on whether to remove the
61-year-old U.S. District Court judge.
   Nixon was convicted in 1986 of lying to a federal grand jury
investigating reports that he intervened with a local prosecutor on
behalf of a defendant in a marijuana smuggling case. He was
incarcerated at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida last year and
recently moved to a New Orleans halfway house.
   Nixon says witnesses lied at his trial and biased prosecutors
held him to an unfair standard of accuracy in his testimony with no
leeway for error.
   If convicted, Nixon would be the seventh official ever removed
through impeachment and the third judge ousted from the federal
bench in three years.
   Alcee L. Hastings of Florida was removed as a District judge two
weeks ago for conspiracy to obtain a $150,000 payoff in return for
reducing the sentences of two defendants to probation and then
lying about it under oath.
   Reporters and spectators were shooed out of the galleries as
lawmakers prepared to debate the impeachment charges against Nixon.
   The closed-door debate came after final arguments Wednesday from
Nixon, defense attorney David Stewart and House members who play
the role of prosecutors in impeachment trials.
   The House approved three articles of impeachment by a vote of
417-0. They charge that Nixon lied to the grand jury and also in an
interview with the FBI and another representative of the Justice
Department
   Conviction on any of the charges by two-thirds of the senators
present and voting would automatically remove Nixon and halt the
$89,500 salary he has continued to collect. Otherwise, he says, he
would like to return to the bench and preside over trials again.

   The nation's manufacturing productivity
improved at an anemic 1.4 percent annual rate in the third quarter,
with output gains at a three-year low and unit labor costs rising
at the fastest rate since the 1982 recession, the government said
Thursday.
   The Labor Department said overall productivity in the non-farm
sector of the economy was up at an annual rate of 2.1 percent in
the July-September period, nearly double the revised 1.1 percent
annual-rate gain posted in the second quarter.
   But that improvement was overshadowed by other data in the
report suggesting that the manufacturing slump is far from over and
that wage inflation remains stubborn despite a recent moderation in
consumer price increases.
   ``Manufacturing is clearly soft,'' said David Wyss of the
DRI-McGraw Hill forecasting firm. ``The economy is slowing down and
that is going to be felt disproportionately by manufacturing.''
   Added Merrill Lynch's Donald Straszheim: ``Manufacturing is not
likely to improve much until well into next year.''
   The 1.4 percent annual-rate gain in manufacturing productivity
in the third quarter was off dramatically from the revised
second-quarter improvement of 3.7 percent. The third-quarter number
represented the smallest productivity increrase since the fourth
quarter of 1987.
   Output in manufacturing was up just 1.3 percent at an annual
rate in the third quarter _ its smallest gain since 1986 _ and
hours worked in American factories declined 0.1 percent at an
annual rate after falling a revised 0.2 percent in the second
quarter.
   September unemployment data showed a 103,000 drop in
manufacturing employment, a sign to analysts that manufacturers
were trying to cut costs and boost productivity.
   But the outlook remains bleak for the next several months, the
analysts said, because rising unit labor costs will exacerbate the
already unfavorable position most U.S. manufacturers find
themselves in in world markets.
   Indeed, the Labor Department said unit labor costs rose at a
rapid 4.5 percent annual rate in the third quarter after falling at
a revised annual rate of 1.0 percent in the second quarter. It was
the largest quarterly increase in unit labor costs in manufacturing
since a 9.7 percent annual gain in the first quarter of 1982.
   The overall numbers for the non-farm sector were somewhat more
encouraging but still underscored the recent economic slowdown and
the persistent upward pressure on wages.
   The 2.1 percent annual-rate non-farm productivity gain resulted
from a 3.1 percent rise in output and just a 1.0 percent gain in
hours worked. The increase in hours worked was the lowest in more
than three years.
   Hourly compensation in the entire non-farm sector rose at an
annual rate of 5.3 percent in the non-farm sector, down from the
second quarter annual-rate gain of 5.6 percent but still evidence
of underlying inflationary pressures.
   ``Inflation is still a very serious problems,'' said Elliott
Platt, a senior vice president and Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette.
   The productivity gain helped offset the impact of wage gains on
unit labor costs in the overall non-farm sector. They increased at
an annual rate of 3.2 percent in the third quarter after rising at
a revised 4.5 percent in the second quarter.

<HEAD>Maryland County Becomes First in Nation To Sell Own Liquor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Montgomery County, a Washington suburb,
became the first county in the nation to have its own brand of
booze when it introduced its County Crest line in liquor stores.
   Gin, rum, bourbon, vodka and scotch have been sold since last
month under the label, which features a knight's helmet and shield
that the county director of liquor control described as a
``knockoff'' of the county crest.
   The County Crest line was described by County Executive Sidney
Kramer as a marketing move to better serve county consumers and to
make Montgomery's county-run liquor stores competitive with
neighboring jurisdictions.
   However, Virginia Bright, head of the county chapter of Mothers
Against Drunk Driving, called the action improper and in poor taste.
   ``What kind of example are we setting for our young people by
having the county's name, the county's crest on alcohol?'' she
asked.
   ``What's the big deal?'' said County Director of Liquor Control
Jerome I. Baylin, noting that it is common for a large liquor store
to sell alcohol under a private label. ``We don't get them to
drink. They have already made the decision.''
   Montgomery County is the only local government in the nation
that controls the wholesale distribution of alcoholic beverages. It
provides beer and wine to retailers in the county and it has a
monopoly on the sale of hard liquor. Four other counties in
Maryland have a less strict form of liquor control, and 18 states
have liquor control.
   ``We walk a fine line,'' Baylin said. ``Basically, we are here
to foster moderation, temperance and respect of the law. But on the
other side of it, we are a revenue-driven agency, here to offer a
product to people who drink.''
   The County Crest spirits, produced by a Baltimore distillery,
have been available for about a month, and several managers of the
stores said it is too soon to say how popular they will be.
   ``They haven't had time to really establish themselves,'' said
Bob Stover, manager of a Rockville store.
   Baylin said the products will appeal to bargain-hunters. For
instance, the 1.75-liter bottle of County Crest vodka costs $10.95,
compared with $11.39 for Gordon's, $13.69 for Smirnoff and $22.99
for Absolut.
   The County Crest spirits are supplied by Majestic Distilling Co.
of Baltimore.

<HEAD>Israeli Efforts to Develop Hydrogen Bomb Hampered by Lack of Supercomputer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel is trying to develop a hydrogen bomb,
according to a classified Pentagon report that supports widely held
suspicions about Israel's nuclear weapons capabilities.
   But Israel's efforts are being slowed, in part, by a deadlock
among U.S. agencies over whether to allow two Israeli research
institutions and the government-owned Israel Military Industries to
buy supercomputers, according to the report and to experts on
nuclear proliferation.
   Published reports over the past 10 days that Israel helped South
Africa develop a ballistic missile that could carry nuclear
warheads are expected to reduce Israel's chances of acquiring such
computers, said experts and sources familiar with the case.
   An inter-agency team has been debating the request for
supercomputer export licenses to Israel, Brazil and India for two
years. Supercomputers are manufactured only in the United States
and Japan, and their export from this nation must be approved by
the federal government because they can be used in weapons
production.
   ``Selling supercomputers to countries that may be pursuing
nuclear weapons or long-range ballistic missiles would be an
extremely ill-advised move,'' Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, said this
week.
   Gary Milholin, an expert on the proliferation of nuclear weapons
and a law professor at the University of Wisconsin, said if the
United States grants Israel a license for a supercomputer ``the
likelihood of its being used to make missiles and bombs is very
great.''
   A report prepared in April 1987 for the Department of Defense
said Israel was ``developing the kind of (computer) codes which
will enable them to make hydrogen bombs.''
   However, ``the Israelis do not yet have the capability to carry
out these kinds of calculations'' for the necessary codes,
according to the report prepared by the Institute for Defense
Analyses.
   ``As far as nuclear technology is concerned, the Israelis are
roughly where the U.S. was in the fission weapon field in about
1955 to 1960,'' the report said.
   Israel is widely believed to have nuclear weapons, although the
government refuses to confirm or deny this.
   Research is being conducted at two nuclear facilities, one near
the Negev Desert town of Dimona and the other at the Sorek facility
south of Tel Aviv, according to the report, which was made
available to The Associated Press.
   The report said the Sorek center works in ``close
collaboration'' with Hebrew University. The university is one of
the three Israeli institutions seeking to buy a supercomputer, said
another source.
   The other two are the Technion Institute of Technology and
Israel Military Industries.
   One source, who was privy to the inter-agency deliberations
until recently, said Technion and Hebrew University have both
offered guarantees that the machines will be used only for academic
research purposes.
   ``It's really a question of how much you trust Israel,'' said
the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Proponents of the sale argue that it is beneficial for U.S.
manufacturers and that Israel could develop nuclear bombs without
the supercomputer, although it would take longer.
   Technion, in a pamphlet to its supporters, said ``a project
taking one month on a supercomputer would require over eight years
on the equipment currently available.''
   Critics of the supercomputer deal argue that Israel, India and
Brazil should not get the machines because they have not signed the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty which seeks to prevent the export
of nuclear weapons technology.
   South Africa recently tested a medium-range ballistic missile
built with Israeli help, U.S. officials say. Israel is also helping
South Africa develop a long-range missile similar to its own Shavit
three-stage rocket, according to the officials.

<HEAD>Nitrogen Storage Means Vidalia Onions at Thanksgiving</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HELENA, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vidalia onions will be available at
Thanksgiving for the first time this year, thanks to a new storage
technique that puts Georgia's famous edible bulbs to sleep for up
to six months in a controlled atmosphere.
   The only problem is Vidalia lovers will need to be in north
Florida to put their hands on the sweet things.
   But the new storage technique is expected to become more
widespread by next growing season, and the one farmer now using the
procedure estimates that within three to five years he will have
enough competition to make the onions available nationwide at least
four months of the year.
   Grower W.J. Grimes has been using his $100,000 nitrogen storage
warehouse since June, but on Thursday held an opening ceremony.
   The sweet hybrid, which under state law can be grown only in
specified areas near Vidalia with low-sulfur content soil, normally
cannot be stored for long periods.
   Grimes placed about 350,000 pounds of his Vidalias in the
special warehouse in June and has kept them stored at 34 degrees in
an atmosphere of 5 percent carbon dioxide, 3 percent oxygen and 92
percent nitrogen.
   The controlled atmosphere puts the onions to sleep.
   The low temperature and the humidity keep them from rotting,
sprouting or rooting, while the low oxygen keeps them sweet and the
high carbon dioxide keeps the onions from getting pungent, said
Doyle Smittle, the scientist who developed the process.
   Nitrogen storage could generate an additional $100 million a
year for growers, he said.
   ``We have the potential to have onions year around,'' said
Smittle, a horticulturist at the University of Georgia's Coastal
Plain Experiment Station in Tifton. ``We need to fine-tune the
system. We know we can store them for six to seven months. We just
don't know about 12 months.''
   Besides generating extra profits for Georgia's 260 registered
growers and packers, he said, it also should improve the overall
quality of the $30-million-a-year crop because some growers now
harvest immature Vidalias to get a jump on the season.
   Last season, Vidalias fetched for their growers $20 to $25 a
50-pound bag early in the six-week season, but within three to four
weeks the price had dropped to $10 to $12 a bag.
   Smittle said he believes nitrogen storage will stabilize prices
and give the industry more control over the supply.
   ``I personally think it's going to increase the total
consumption of onions,'' he said. ``I'm sure there are people out
there like me who, when they can't get a good Vidalia onion, quit
eating onions.''
   The consumer should benefit from the more controlled marketing
season of Vidalias, Grimes said, because it will cut down wild
price swings. He said a consumer who pays 89 cents a pound for the
onions, then sees them a week later for 39 cents a pound ``feels
cheated.''
   Grimes sold all his onions to a major grocery chain in Florida.
   ``You'll have to go to north Florida if you want one,'' Smittle
said.

   Apartment manager Joe Hart had a hunch it
wasn't going to be a routine apartment inspection when he found a
caiman in the bathroom. The poisonous snake in the closet confirmed
his suspicions.
   Hart says he usually expects to find a few unwanted items left

   ``A cat, a dog, a canary, that's one thing ...,'' Hart said
after finding a 4-foot, 50-pound caiman _ an alligator relative _
wrapped around the toilet in the bathroom and a 3-foot cottonmouth
snake in an aquarium in the closet.
   ``I went in the bathroom and started to reach down to turn off
the water and I saw the tail and then the head and got out of

   Humane Society employees removed the pets Wednesday.

<HEAD>Judges on Strike Nationwide, Indefinite Walkout in Medellin</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Judges and court workers began a series
of nationwide strikes Thursday, a day after another judge and a
congressman were murdered, apparently by drug traffickers.
   In Medellin, where the judge was killed, federal justices walked
off the job indefinitely until they receive more protection.
   It is the third time judges have gone on strike in the last
three months, with each walkout following the assassination of a
federal judge. In the last eight years 222 court workers, including
43 judges, have been killed, most of them by drug traffickers.
   In the latest slaying, federal Judge Mariela Espinoza was killed
by submachine gun fire from two speeding cars as she arrived at her
Medellin home Wednesday night with two motorcycle guards. One of
the bodyguards and a bystander were wounded.
   Mrs. Espinoza, 43, was one of 42 federal appellate judges in
Medellin, a city of 2 million people that is the cocaine capital of
Colombia. It was not immediately known if she had handled drug
trafficking cases.
   In the capital of Bogota federal Rep. Luis Francisco Madero was
killed with a pistol shot to the head Wednesday night by a man who
was waiting for Madero in the shadows outside the congressman's
apartment.
   Madero, a 27-year veteran in Colombia's House of
Representatives, had supported extradition of Colombians to the
United States to face drug trafficking charges.
   No one claimed responsibility for either of the slayings, but
government security forces say that brought to 42 the number of
people killed by drug traffickers since a government crackdown
began 11 weeks ago.
   The deaths include the three federal judges, a congressman, a
governor, a state leader of the leftist Patriotic Union and nine
news media employees. Two newspapers have been bombed.
   The traffickers are trying to force the government to reverse
its decision to extradite suspected Colombian drug traffickers to
the United States. Five suspected traffickers have been extradited
so far.
   The National Association of Court Workers, which includes 5,000
judges and and 12,000 other court workers, declared a strike of two
hours Thursday, four hours Friday, and all of Nov. 7 and Nov. 8.
   No strike was declared for Monday because it was a holiday.
   The 42 appellate judges in Medellin said they would go on strike
until the government assures them of safety from drug traffickers.
The announcement came in a communique from Judge Jaime Gomez,
president of the Association of Federal Appellate Judges in
Medellin.
   The judges also walked off the job after a federal appellate
judge was killed in Bogota just before the government's antidrug
crackdown began Aug. 19, and after another appellate judge was
killed in Medellin Oct. 17.
   In unrelated violence, the Colombian army said it killed nine
leftist guerrillas in fighting in the southeast plains, near the
town of Valparaiso, 280 miles southeast of Bogota.

oddly down the street with bulging pants and found that he had 21
live homing pigeons stuffed in his clothes.
   Thomas Waddell, 25, was charged Tuesday with stealing 30 homing
pigeons, valued at $300, from a neighbor, John Styron. Waddell also
was charged with stealing 40 homing pigeons worth $2,400 late
Monday from William Allen of Baltimore.
   ``He looked like the Michelin tire ad,'' said Officer Ronald
Pettie, who stopped Waddell. Pettie said as he approached the
suspect, Waddell was stuffing a pigeon down his pants.
   After he was arrested, Waddell began shaking and pulling pigeons
from inside his pants, Pettie said. In all, he pulled out 21 live
pigeons and five dead ones.
   ``There were pigeon feathers all over the place,'' Pettie said.
   Metal bands on the birds' legs indicated they belonged to
Styron, Pettie said. He said some of Styron's pigeons flew off for
their coops behind Styron's home, while police returned other birds
to him.
   Waddell also was charged with cruelty to animals and malicious
destruction of property, the coops.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Dismisses Case Against Pettersson</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHAN RAPP</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An appeals court Thursday formally
dismissed the case against the man convicted of killing Prime
Minister Olof Palme, but left a cloud of suspicion hanging over him.
   Police said they would continue to hunt for evidence against
Christer Pettersson, a career criminal who was arrested in December
for the 1986 shooting.
   The State Attorney has until Nov. 30 to appeal to the Supreme
Court, but the court normally would agree to review the case only
if a question of legal principle were involved.
   The appeals court ruled that Pettersson likely was the man seen
outside a movie theater where Palme was slain, and dismissed his
alibi. But it said it had not been proved that he killed the
Swedish leader.
   Pettersson, 42, could be tried again if further evidence is
discovered before the 25-year statute of limitations takes effect,
legal experts said.
   The Svea Court of Appeals was unanimous in overturning
Pettersson's July 27 conviction by the Stockholm District Court,
which had sentenced him to life imprisonment.
   On Oct. 12 the appeals court freed Pettersson from jail pending
publication of the full written judgment on Thursday.
   ``It cannot be considered proved that the perpetrator is
identical with Christer Pettersson. Therefore, the court leaves the
indictment unsanctioned,'' the appeals court said.
   Palme, who was prime minister for 11 years and Scandinavia's
leading international figure, was shot while walking home from a
movie with his wife, Lisbeth.
   ``Pettersson is still a suspect with us,'' Ingemar Krusell, a
senior investigator, was quoted as saying by the national news
agency TT.
   He said the police had formed a special squad focusing on
finding evidence against Pettersson, while two other teams puruse
other possible leads.
   The lower court convicted Pettersson in a split decision,
largely on Mrs. Palme's identification of Pettersson. She testified
that she was ``absolutely certain'' he was the man she saw when she
looked up from her dying husband.
   The appellate court stressed she saw the gunman for a brief
moment in poor light, and said ``the fact that Lisbeth Palme was
upset can have affected her ability to carry out exact
observations.''
   The court also pointed to the gap of almost three years before
she first identified Pettersson in a videotaped police lineup.
   The verdict cited the 1976 British study by the Devlin
Commission which cast doubt on the reliability of witness
identification.
   ``No one should be sentenced on the base of identification,
unless that evidence is supported by other forms of proof,'' the
court said.
   The court noted ``the lack of technical evidence, especially the
murder weapon,'' believed to be a .357-caliber Magnum.
   It said there was no proof Pettersson had any experience with
guns and pointed at the investigation's failure to establish a
motive.
   Pettersson, who has a long criminal record and a history of drug
abuse, has maintained his innocence and said he admired the
socialist prime minister.
   During the first year of the Palme investigation, which was the
largest manhunt in Swedish history, police pursued several
conspiracy theories implicating ones involving Kurdish militants,
the Iranian government and even an alleged cabal of Swedish police.
All were found baseless.
   Several government commissions condemned the conduct of the
investigation as bumbling and sloppy, and several reputations were
destroyed by the case.
   In June 1988 Justice Minister Anna-Greta Leijon was forced to
resign for giving her support to a private probe of the murder
which bypassed official authorities.

   The wife of ousted East German Communist Party
leader Erich Honecker lost her cabinet post in a series of
top-level resignations Thursday, and tens of thousands of marchers
in three cities demanded democratic reforms.
   New party leader Egon Krenz said his government wanted closer
ties with the European Economic Community and called for a quick
trade agreement. He also discussed reforms with Poland's new prime
minister.
   Krenz promised to announce on Monday a new law allowing freedom
of travel to the West, according to Martin Bangemann, an EEC
commissioner from West Germany who spoke with the East German
leader.
   Thousands of East Germans weren't waiting, however, and poured
into neighboring Czechoslovakia after Krenz lifted a monthold
travel ban. The East Germans hoped to follow countrymen who have
fled West.
   Tens of thousands of those who stayed behind carried candles and
banners as they marched in the East German cities of Erfurt, Halle
and Wilhelm Pieck Stadt. Some shouted over loudspeakers for more
democracy and an end to Community Party privileges, the state-run
news agency ADN reported.
   An opposition leader challenged the Communists to abandon their
40-year monopoly on power.
   Several longtime party officials surrendered their positions as
the pressure for reform intensified.
   Margot Honecker's resignation was announced by ADN following a
cabinet meeting. Mrs. Honecker, 62, had held the post since 1963.
   Two regional Communist Party bosses were replaced, the chief of
the Communist-controlled trade union federation stepped down and
the leaders of two Communist-allied political parties resigned, ADN
said.
   Among those who resigned were Heinrich Homann, the 78-year-old
leader of the National Democratic Party, and Gerald Goetting, the
66-year-old chief of the Christian Democrats.
   Both men also were among the nation's four vice presidents.
   All recognized political parties in East Germany are allied with
the Communists and have closely followed the dominant party's
doctrine. But in recent weeks some of the non-communist parties
have begun to assert their independence.
   Homann and Goetting were believed to have resigned under
pressure from party members. The two parties have a combined
membership of slightly more than 200,000.
   Annelis Kimmel, 55, became the first woman to head the nation's
8.6 million-member, state-run trade union federation when she was
elected to replace Harry Tisch, a protege of Honecker, himself
ousted on Oct. 18.
   Tisch, 62, who headed the organization for 14 years, also is a
member of the Communist Party's policy-making Politburo. It was not
immediately known if he would lose that post as well, or whether
Mrs. Kimmel would gain that seat if he did.
   Young unionists had complained that Tisch ran the federation
only with the party's interests in mind. Mrs. Kimmel promised to
work for more independence for the Communist-controlled trade
unions, according to ADN.
   In an interview with West Germany's Saarland radio, an
opposition leader challenged the Communist Party's leading role in
the society, saying no democratization was possible unless the
party gave up this self-assigned role.
   ``If the party does not give up this claim, there will be no
democratization, no revival of the economy, no solution to the many
problems,'' said Ehrhard Neubert, a leader of the opposition group
Democratic Awakening.
   The Communists could not win a free election, Neubert said.
   Michael Goebel, a member of the largest opposition group, New
Forum, said in an interview with a state-run East German newspaper
that for his group ``the removal of the Communist Party was not
part of the debate.''
   The group says it is pushing for reforms within the socialist
system.
   Krenz met Thursday in Warsaw with Poland's Prime Minister
Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the East bloc's first non-communist leader.
Krenz called it a ``good experience'' and said they could learn
from each other.
   ``He told me how one should judge things, but we did not give
each other recommendations,'' Krenz said.
   ``We spoke openly with each other and those who speak openly
with each other quickly find a way to solve all complicated and
uncomplicated problems,'' he said.

<HEAD>Harassment Continues Outside U.S. Embassy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the fourth time in a week, U.S. officials
protested the large Chinese police presence outside the U.S.
Embassy and the harassment by guards of staff and visitors, an
embassy source said Thursday.
   Also Thursday, China said former President Richard Nixon's visit
will help restore badly strained relations with the United States,
but it insisted again that the blame lies with Washington.
   In the U.S. capital, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher
said incidents of harassment are ``unacceptably intrusive security
activity, and we have protested this and previous actions to
Chinese authorities both in Washington and in Beijing.''
   The embassy source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
latest verbal protest came Wednesday, hours before another night of
provocations outside Ambassador James Lilley's residence.
   On Wednesday night, about two dozen uniformed police and at
least 10 plainclothes police congregated outside the gate to the
residence, shining a spotlight and forcing visitors to go through a
gauntlet of armed guards.
   Twenty other policemen were posted on nearby streetcorners and
along the street in front of the compound, turning some cars away
and forcing those going to the embassy to park hundreds of yards
away even though there were many empty spaces near the gate.
   When visitors tried to park closer to the embassy, police banged
on their cars and yelled at them to leave.
   Police cursed at a CBS crew that tried to photograph them, and
they shined another spotlight into the crew's camera.
   A similar massing of police occurred Tuesday evening, only then
they were armed with automatic rifles and did not carry spotlights.
   In an apparent gesture to Nixon, the People's Armed Police
around the three U.S. Embassy compounds did not carry rifles
Wednesday for the first time in four months.
   Nixon aides said the former president told Premier Li Peng he
did not like guns and did not want to see rifle-toting guards when
he visited the embassy.
   On Thursday, guards continued to wear pistols, and eight black
or gray Mercedes sedans, some without license plates and with what
apparently were plainclothes police inside, again were parked along
the street outside the ambassador's residence.
   The embassy also has complained of three cases of embassy staff
findig their car tires slashed and security forces tailing embassy
employees as they left the compounds.
   Twice in the past week, armed police outside the embassy pointed
their automatic rifles at children of U.S. diplomats and pulled the
trigger, an embassy source said. The guns were not loaded.
   During a Halloween party at the embassy on Saturday, the arrival
of people wearing costumes apparently rattled the Chinese. At least
80 police were called in, seemingly to block Chinese fugitives from
sneaking into embassy grounds. Police became particularly upset
when partygoers arrived carrying a fake coffin.
   One man who came to the party dressed in a gorilla suit was told
to park his car elsewhere.
   Premier Li reportedly told Nixon that the heavy guard _ most
embassies have only one or two Chinese police posted outside _ was
necessary to prevent the escape of dissidents Fang Lizhi and his
wife Li Shuxian, who took refuge in the embassy after the June 4
military crackdown on the pro-democracy movement.
   Fang and Li, wanted by Chinese police as counterrevolutionary
agitators, remain in one of the embassy compounds.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing, asked about the police
harassment at a weekly briefing Thursday, said China ``always
attached importance to the safety of the foreign embassies in
China.''
   Li said Nixon's five-day visit, which ended several before the
briefing, ``will undoubtedly be conducive to the restoration and
development of the normal relations.''
   But he said ``it is imperative for the United States, and
actually the United States only, to take the initiative'' in
improving ties.
   Washington cut off high-level contacts with Beijing after the
crackdown, when Chinese troops killed hundreds of unarmed
civilians. It has urged China to end repression against those who
advocate democratic reform.
   Nixon aides said he will present an account of his visit to
President Bush.

<HEAD>Albanians Killed in Riots in Kosovo</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   At least five ethnic Albanians were
killed during riots in Kosovo over the trial of the former
provincial Communist Party chief, said reports Thursday from the
troubled southern province.
   Sources said four were killed Thursday in Pristina, the capital,
when police dislodged armed men who barricaded themselves inside an
apartment house.
   Police said a man identified as Bedri Skolji was shot dead
Wednesday night when about 1,000 people protested in Pristina.
   About 500 ethnic Albanians tried to mount a protest in the
provincial capital's main thoroughfare Thursday evening, but police
dispersed them with tear gas and clubs.
   Some protesters ran into the city's largest department store,
but police dragged them out, a witness reported. The witness said
20 to 30 people were arrested.
   The trouble stems from the trial of Azem Vlasi, the former party
chief, and and 14 other members of the overwhelming ethnic Albanian
majority in Kosovo, an impoverished southern province bordering
Albania. Of Kosovo's 1.9 million people, 85 percent are ethnic
Albanians.
   Their trial opened Monday, but was postponed immediately for at
least 10 days so appeals courts can rule on demands by Vlasi's
lawyers that the presiding judge and prosecutor be removed on
grounds of bias.
   On Wednesday, about 1,000 policemen sealed off Pristina's
Suncani Breg district, where armed men barricaded themselves in the
apartment building and held security forces at bay with automatic
weapons fire, a source told The Associated Press.
   Shooting was ``fierce'' and began after a midday street protest,
he said by telephone.
   No figures were available on the number of people wounded, the
source reported. He said a special team of paramilitary national
police cleared everyone from the building, one of several in a
modern housing complex.
   Running battles between police and demonstrators were reported
in other Kosovo towns. Television news said one officer was
seriously injured Podujevo, 20 miles north of Pristina, by a man
who struck him with an ax.
   The deaths were the first in the violence that began Monday,
whent the trial began of the 15 men charged with
``counterrevolutionary activity.''
   Vlasi also is accused of inciting riots in February and March in
which at least 25 people, including two policemen, were killed.
   Those riots followed passage of constitutional amendments by the
Serbian republic, in which Kosovo is an autonomous republic, giving
Serbia control of the police and judiciary.
   Serbia said the action was necessary to prevent harassment of
the Slavic minority by the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, a heartland
of ancient Serbia.

   A former nursing home aide was
sentenced Thursday to life in prison with no chance of parole for
smothering five patients in a pact with her former lover.
   Gwendolyn Graham showed no emotion and declined Circuit Judge
Roman Snow's offer to speak before he sentenced her to six life
terms.
   Catherine Wood, Graham's former lover and also a former aide at
the nursing home, was sentenced last month to 20 to 40 years in
prison after pleading guilty to second-degree murder.
   Graham, 26, was convicted Sept. 20 of five counts of murder and
one count of conspiracy to murder for killing the five
incapacitated patients in 1987 at Alpine Manor Nursing Home in
Walker, a northwest suburb of Grand Rapids.
   Wood, 27, admitted she sometimes served as a lookout or diverted
supervisors' attention while Graham suffocated the five with
washclothes.
   Most of the victims, who ranged in age from 60 to 97, suffered
from Alzheimer's disease.
   Jan Hunderman, a daughter of one of the smothered patients,
said: ``Now we can just get on with our lives.''
   Wood, the prosecution's key witness, testified the murders were
part of a pact the two hoped would bind their love. She said Graham
told her the killings helped her ``relieve tension.''
   Graham, arrested in December in her hometown of Tyler, Texas,
maintained her innocence during the trial, testifying the murder
plot was nothing more than a joke between the two women intended to
scare their friends.
   Graham's lawyer, James Piazza, said he will appeal.
   Piazza said Wood went to police because Graham had left her for
another woman.
   The deaths initially were attributed to natural causes and no
autopsies were performed. Police began investigating after Wood's
ex-husband told them she had confessed.

   Soldiers and highway equipment from
across the state are bolstering a retooled effort to remove piles
of debris that have littered roadsides of North Carolina's largest
city since Tropical Storm Hugo.
   With residents getting impatient and the fire hazard increasing,
the city last week backed off a plan initiated by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency to turn over the entire cleanup to
private companies.
   Immediately after the Sept. 22 storm, hundreds of city and state
workers cleared streets. But they returned to their regular jobs
and the city began seeking contractors to remove the debris that
continued to pile up in front of nearly every home in this inland
city of more than 350,000 people.
   Many of the bids were considered too high, others too low to
ensure the businesses could complete the job. One bid came in at
$48,785 and another at $1.8 million for the same job involving a
section of Charlotte.
   ``It became obvious we weren't going to get moving,'' said
Pressley Beaver, the city official in charge of the cleanup. ``We
had a lot of highly reputable contractors tell us they weren't
going to shoot craps and roll the dice. That's why so many came in
so high.''
   On Monday, about 330 state Department of Transportation workers
and 250 city workers began a citywide cleanup, using such heavy
equipment as front-end loaders and dump trucks. Their efforts are
to supplement the businesses whose bids were accepted in a cleanup
expected to cost $15 million, most of which will be paid by the
federal government.
   It's up to crew supervisors to decide how each area is cleaned
up.
   ``We are under emergency conditions,'' Beaver said. ``We've got
a huge volume of dry debris and the lack of rain has produced a
substantial threat of fires.
   ``The patience of residents is being tested,'' Beaver
acknowledged. ``They're getting tired of it.''
   Officials have been saying all along that it could take until
spring to complete the job.
   That's not much consolation to residents like Peggy Malley.
   ``It's a hazard,'' she said, looking at the large pile of tree
limbs in front of her house. ``I've watered it down a couple of
times but it's still awful dry.
   ``I know these things don't happen all the time, but it's been
more than a month,'' she said.
   According to city officials, more than 2 million cubic yards of
debris, or 200,000 truckloads, were left along the city's 3,000
miles of curbs. That's enough to fill a 60-story skyscraper three
or four times.
   Some residents could see progress this week.
   On Wednesday, eight soldiers from Fort Bragg, about 100 miles
east, pulled in front of 84-year-old Hazeline Hinkle's small brick
home. In less than 30 minutes, they removed the oak that flattened
her garage.
   ``I really appreciate what they're doing,'' said Mrs. Hinkle, a
widow whose insurance did not cover all of the damage to her home
of 52 years. ``I need a new roof, my bedroom leaks and my garage is
in pieces.''
   For the team of soldiers, it was their eighth job in less than
two days. Sixty-two Fort Bragg soldiers had volunteered for the
duty.
   ``There's no better feeling in the world than being
appreciated,'' said Spec. Aaron Smith, of Columbus, Miss. ``I only
wish we could do more.''
   The United Way of the Central Carolinas is coordinating the
volunteer effort to clean up the yards of elderly, poor and
disabled residents.
   The organization has received more than 2,100 requests for
assistance. With the help of 60 to 70 volunteers a day, about 800
yards have been cleaned, and United Way officials are begging for
more volunteers and equipment.
   ``Progress has been somewhat slow, but there are reasons for
that,'' said Vivian Hamilton of the United Way. ``Many would-be
volunteers are still cleaning up their own back yards.''
   Still, her concern for the needy was foremost.
   ``Many of the elderly and handicapped people calling in feel
like they're deserted,'' she said. ``We try to assure them that
we'll get there.''

   What to give Santa Claus, the man who truly
has everything, for Christmas? Why not his own ZIP code?
   So the U.S. Postal Service has done it, giving Santa the ZIP
code of 30351-1989. That's the number boys and girls can use when
they address their letters to the jolly old elf.
   Children always have been able to write to Santa without even
that much of an address, and they still can. The Postal Service has
ways of getting those letters to him, or some of his volunteers
scattered around the country. Somehow, most letters get answered _
often with toys if the child appears needy.
   Now, however, the Coca-Cola Co. is trying to give a boost to the
tradition of writing to Santa and got the postal people to
cooperate with 30351, which happens to be in the Atlanta area where
Coke is and not the North Pole where Santa is.
   To make things easier, the company is putting form letters on
the sides of some of its cartons.
   The soft-drink maker, said Postal Service spokesman Ray Jacobs,
is donating 5 cents for each of the first 2 million letters it
receives to the Marine Corps Reserve's Toys-for-Tots program.
   ``We don't want people to think they have to buy cartons of Coke
to send letters to Santa,'' Jacobs said.

<HEAD>Senate Rejects Attempt to Force House to Disclosing Mailing Costs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senators made clear Thursday they want House
members to join them in disclosing mass mailing costs, but refused
to force the issue in order to avoid scuttling a deal to cut the
taxpayer-financed mailings in half.
   Senators voted 64-35 to table _ in effect to reject _ an
amendment by Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H. that would have required
the House disclosure.
   Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., warned that the House would reject a
conference agreement to cut mass mailings from six to three
annually per member if senators attempted to change House rules.
   Reid, the chief Senate negotiator of the mail reduction
agreement, said that while he and other senators fought earlier for
Humphrey's plan for quarterly disclosure, they were unwilling to
jeopardize the compromise now.
   `We have gotten from the House all we're going to get,'' said
Reid. ``The conference we had with the House was brutal. The House
had the feeling we should clean up our house before we tell them
what to do.''
   Humphrey, however, argued, ``We have to say we're not going to
be blackmailed. I suggest we have the guts to stand up to the
blackmail of the House.''
   The vote was the latest development in the continuing debate
over changing one of lawmakers' favorite perks: mailings, usually
newsletters, addressed to ``postal patrons'' throughout their
states or districts. The mailings always rise in an election year
because they are considered a great advantage to incumbents.
   Members of each house, however, have used the mail debate to
threaten changes in the way the other chamber does its business.
Senators don't like the idea that only their rules require
disclosure of mailing costs by each member. The House objects to
senators' use of money from honoraria, political action committees
and party campaign committees for office expenses.
   While the House has approved the conference agreement with the
mass mail reductions, the Senate debate is continuing. It was
unclear when the Senate would decide to either accept the agreement
or buck the issue back to the House.
   In addition to the mass mail reductions, the conference
agreement would: establish for the first time separate House and
Senate mail accounts; limit the size of newsletters to two sheets
of paper; establish a voluntary procedure for keeping mail costs
within their budget and strictly enforce a prohibition against
postal patron mailings 60 days before an election.
   The compromise would budget $100.2 million for mailings,
including $44.5 million for the House, $23.9 million for the Senate
and the remainder to pay the Postal Service for mailings that
exceeded the fiscal 1989 mail budget.

said Thursday.
   De Klerk also said the ANC ``remains committed to violence and
terrorism'' and will not be legalized until it drops its commitment
to an anti-government guerrilla campaign.
   The president, addressing a military parade, said that at the
huge pro-ANC rally Sunday ``there occurred what appeared to be
contraventions of existing laws,'' but he did not elaborate.
   Speakers at the rally, including four of the freed guerrilla
leaders, endorsed their movement's use of violence and some quoted
exiled ANC officials _both violations of security laws.
   De Klerk said police were preparing a dossier for the attorney
general so he can decide whether to prosecute, an added: ``Law and
order will be maintained.''
   The seven freed African National Congress leaders were released
unconditionally on Oct. 15 but their guerrilla movement remains
outlawed.
   De Klerk said the free prisoners ``must guard against being
misused by those seeking continued confrontation. They would also
be wise to steer away from imflammatory rhetoric.''
   De Klerk said further major political changes were needed to
resolve South Africa's racial conflict. He gave no specifics
Thursday but has said previously that additional steps under
consideration include lifting of the state of emergency and release
of Nelson Mandela, the best-known ANC leader, who remains in prison.
   Mandela is widely expected to be freed within the next few
months. Justice Ministry spokesman Dirk de Villiers described as
``just speculation'' a report Thursday that tentative plans were
being made for Mandela to be released in January.
   Constitutional Development Minister Gerrit Viljoen, assigned by
de Klerk to draw black leaders into negotiations, said in a
television interview that the rally Sunday had ``exposed the ANC
for what it is _ an organization that openly flaunts its
association with the Communist Party.''
   The flag of the outlawed South African Communist Party was
draped behind the podium at a soccer stadium near Johannesburg,
where more than 70,000 people gathered.

   More than 300 police commanded by
Algerian officers will guard a Parliament meeting to elect a
president under terms of a peace plan opposed by Christian leader
Gen. Michel Aoun, security sources said Thursday.
   Sources in Moslem west Beirut said the session scheduled for
Saturday may be postponed for a few days to give Christian
Parliamentarians a last chance to convince Aoun to back the Arab
League-brokered plan.
   But the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
meeting will take place before Tuesday, in compliance with the
accord approved by Parliament at a special session in Taif, Saudi
Arabia, last month.
   The accord, aimed at ending a 14-year-old civil war, shifts
political power to the Moslem majority, revamping a political
system formed in the 1940s when Christians were the majority. Aoun
says the plan lacks a fixed timetable for the withdrawal of 40,000
Syrian troops backing Moslem forces.
   Aoun, who heads the Christian Cabinet in Lebanon's dual
government, has threatened to dissolve the 99-seat house if it
convened to elect a speaker, elect a head of state and ratify the
``national reconciliation charter'' to which he is opposed.
   No one officially has declared their candidacy for president,
although two parliamentarians have said they would run. They are
Elias Hrawi, from east Lebanon, and Rene Moawwad, of north Lebanon,
both Maronite Christians.
   Aoun has called Christian Parliamentarians who approved the
accord ``traitors.'' Most Christian politicians, militia commanders
and spiritual leaders also have backed the accord.
   In his latest statement Thursday, he stopped short of repeating
a threat to dissolve Parliament. But he said: ``Continuing with
such constitutional violations and hypocrisy would force us to take
decisive measures ... to safeguard the constitution.''
   He did not specify what he planned to do.
   Lakhdar Ibrahimi, assistant seceratry-general of the 22-nation
Arab League, told the newspaper An-Nahar that arrangements have
been completed to secure a one-mile radius neutral zone around
Villa Mansour, the proposed venue of Saturday's debate in the
no-man's land of Beirut's dividing Green Line.
   Reached later at the Summerland Hotel in west Beirut, Ibrahimi
said the area will be patrolled by the Lebanese police under the
supervision of nine Algerian officers who arrived earlier in the
week for that purpose.
   Ibrahimi, an Algerian, would not give other details.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be identified in line with
regulations, said the Lebanese force will comprise 300 men and be
deployed on Friday evening ``if no postponement of the session is
announced.''
   ``The whole police force in Beirut will be on alert to provide
back-up, if needed,'' he added.
   The peace plan emerged after 23 days of wrangling on political
reforms sought by Moslems, and the Christians' demand for a fixed
timetable for a Syrian troop withdrawal from Lebanon.
   The Moslems obtained some concessions: mainly an increase of
Parliament seats to 108 divided equally between Christians and
Moslems, and a cutback in the powers of the Christian president to
give the Parliament speaker and prime minister, traditionally
Moslems, a wider share in the decision-making process.
   Under an unwritten covenant dating from independence from the
French in 1943, the president is a Maronite, the prime minister a
Sunni and the Parliament Speaker a Shiite.
   But Aoun complained the accord referred only to a phased Syrian
withdrawal from the Beirut region in two years, without any
commitment for a total pullout.
   The Syrians maintain its troops in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab
League peacekeeping mandate.
   Twenty-eight Parliamentarians have refused to return home after
the Taif meeting, fearing action against them by supporters of
Aoun. They gathered in Paris.
   On Thursday, they agreed to send two representatives, George
Saadeh, who heads the largest Christian political group, the
Phalange Party, and Kazem Khalil, to meet with Aoun before Saturday.

   A landlord was sentenced Thursday to
one year in prison in the deaths of two men trapped inside a
burning apartment house by a locked corridor door.
   Frank Thomas, who installed the lock that violated safety codes
at the request of tenants, appeared shaken by the sentence,
although he could have received up to eight years in prison.
   ``I wished it didn't happen,'' he told state Supreme Court
Justice Nicholas Colabella. ``I tried to help them (the tenants)
and make them comfortable. ... I'm sorry this thing happened.''
   Thomas, 68, of New Rochelle, was convicted Sept. 18 on two
counts of criminally negligent homicide.
   Eight people were killed in the Jan. 15 fire at the Yonkers
apartment building where Thomas was landlord. State Supreme Court
Justice Nicholas Colabella convicted Thomas in only two deaths
because the charred bodies of the men were found behind the door,
which locked from both the inside and the outside.
   Thomas said he installed the lock because tenants wanted to keep
non-residents out of the building.
   The fire, started by the careless smoking of a resident in a
basement apartment, spread rapidly because there was no fire door
between the basement and first floor, another code violation,
authorities said.
   Relatives of the fire victims have sued Thomas.
   Colabella said Thomas was ``not the typical slumlord. You were
attempting to keep the building, in your own way, habitable, even
though it resulted in the building not being safe.''
   Colabella said the city of Yonkers was ``a party to the
tragedy'' since Thomas was not cited for various code violations
and the building had not been inspected regularly.
   Thomas will remain free on $5,000 bond, pending appeal.

   Five KGB officers sat under the harsh lights
Thursday for a questioning that touched on some of the Soviet
Union's most sensitive secrets.
   The five were not accused traitors, nor were they among the
feared secret service's counterintelligence officers trying to
wring out a confession.
   They were answering questions from the Soviet public in a
first-of-its-kind nationwide call-in program at a Soviet TV studio.
   If the spokesmen for the five KGB departments didn't reveal how
many agents are working abroad as diplomats or trade
representatives, how many have been killed or defected in recent
years, nor the size of the KGB budget, they at least showed off the
KGB's new atmosphere of openness.
   ``Today the KGB is not asking the questions,'' national TV
commentator Vladimir Tsvetov said opening the 75-minute program
that preceded the evening TV news. ``Today they are being asked
questions.''
   Questions from around the country, taken by a group of telephone
operators seated behind the panel, were written out and read by
Tsvetov. That eliminated the possibility of direct exchanges
between the officers and their questioners.
   Questions touched the personal lives, salaries and living
conditions of KGB officers, details of the secret service's foreign
activities as well as charges of its activity inside the Soviet
Union.
   _ Svetlana Matviyenko, a vocational school student from
Leningrad, asked about the romantic tough-guy image of the spy as
portrayed in the James Bond movies.
   ``We wouldn't like our agents to have even the smallest part of
these qualities. That's why it's just ridiculous to speak about the
likeness between a Soviet secret agent and James Bond,'' said Maj.
Gen. Anatoly Bondarev of the KGB personnel department.
   Responding to another question, Bondarev acknowledged that a few
Soviet spies have defected in recent years, causing ``serious
political and moral damage.''
   ``They deserve the most severe punishment,'' he added. ``But we
are principally opposed to passing a verdict in abstentia and
principally opposed to summary punishment.''
   _ Asked if any KGB officers were punished personnally for
hounding Nobel Peace Prize winner Andrei D. Sakharov or exiled
Nobel literature laureates Alexander Solzhenitsyn or Josef Brodsky
during the 1960s and 1970s, Col. Alexander Karbainov, spokesman for
constitutional security department, said:
   ``Those actions were determined by the law that was in force and
the political situation in the country. It doesn't make sense to
talk about personal responsibility, but concerning the KGB as an
organization we share the responsibility for those actions.''
   _ Asked by lawyer Alexander Yegorov of Moscow whether the time
will come when Soviets will be able to see their KGB file, Maj.
Gen. Gennady Kislikh of the investigations department denied that
the KGB has any personal files on Soviet citizens.
   In response to a question about the number of KGB agents working
abroad, and how many have been killed in the line of duty, Vasily
Dozhdalev said all secret services keep such information secret and
that ``I don't want to make their work easier.''
   The TV program comes at a time when KGB chief Vladimir Kryuchkov
is trying to remold his organization's fearful image.
   In the era of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of
glasnost, or greater openness, the KGB and its predecessors have
been subjected to unaccustomed open criticism for repressing Soviet
citizens.
   On Monday, a group of protesters held lighted candles in front
of KGB headquarters on Moscow's Dzerzhinsky Square in memorial to
the victims of the organization's excesses. Following that protest,
which was peaceful, a group of demonstrators tried to march to
Pushkin Square and many were badly beaten by riot police in the
most savage attack on demonstrators in Moscow in the past 18 months.
   Kryuchkov has spoken out for cooperation against terrorism and
drug trafficking among the world's secret services, has granted
several interviews with foreign journalists and permitted the
government news agency Novosti to make a film about the KGB.
   In keeping with the effort to remodel the image of KGB officers,
Bondarev told Tsvetov that many officers are multitalented people
who write music or poetry, or paint landscapes.
   As a memento of the program, Tsvetov handed out to the five
buttons sold by private producers that are popular now in Moscow.
The buttons read: ``KGB Agent.''

   A major Japanese rice wine brewer plans to set up a
factory in Colorado that will use ``pure Rocky Mountain water'' to
make traditional Japanese sake, the company said Thursday.
   Tatsuuma-Honke Brewing Co., a sake brewer based in western
Japan, will build its $7 million factory in Golden, Colo., on land
bought from Adolph Coors Co., a major U.S. brewer, said Tetsuya
Ogura, Tatsuuma-Honke spokesman.
   Dry air, cool weather and abundant, pure water from the Rocky
Mountains, as well as cheap rice, are factors that led the company
to set up a brewery in Colorado, Ogura said.
   Constrution of the factory is to start next April. It is
expected to produce 200,000 bottles of rice wine a year beginning
in March 1991, with output increasing to 500,000 bottles in the
third year of production.

   Afghan guerrillas on Thursday
rejected peace talks with the Kabul government as suggested in a
resolution adopted by the U.N. General Assembly.
   ``We see the resolution as the same as last year,'' said
Najibullah Lefrey, minister of information of the Afghan
government-in-exile in neighboring Pakistan, where many of the
guerrillas are based.
   The U.N. document, adopted by consensus Wednesday, calls for an
``intra-Afghan dialogue for the establishment of a broad-based
government to ensure ... immediate participation of all segments of
the Afghan people.''
   The insurgents, armed mainly by the United States and Pakistan,
have been fighting the Soviet-backed Kabul government for 11 years.
   ``We don't believe it means the puppet regime should have any
involvement in the talks,'' said Lefrey, referring to the ruling
People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan which seized power in a
bloody 1978 military coup that sparked the insurgency.
   ``The PDPA has no support, so how can it be included in a
broad-based government?'' he said.
   An official of the Pakistan Foreign Ministry, which drafted the
U.N. resolution in consultation with Moscow, acknowledged the call
for intra-Afghan dialogue was not new. But he said this one differs
from last year's document by calling for a cease-fire and for a
solution to the conflict that recognizes the ``Islamic character of
Afghanistan.''
   The guerrillas, known as the mujahedeen or Islamic ``holy
warriors,'' aim to make Afghanistan an Islamic republic.
   ``Intra-Afghan dialogue is quite vague,'' said the Pakistani
official on condition he not be identified by name. ``The Soviet
side may interpret it as comprising all sides, including Afghan
President Najib and the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan.''
   But the guerrillas have refused to accept either Najib or his
party in a post-war government.
   The resolution's call for a ``cessation of hostilities'' also is
open to interpretation, the official said.
   Kabul and Moscow have said they want a cease-fire first,
followed by efforts to find a political solution. Mujahedeen have
refused to lay down their arms until Najib and his party are out.
   ``There have been compromises on both sides to reach a consensus
resolution,'' said the Pakistani official. ``How else do you
achieve a consensus?''
   The United Nations in 1988 brokered an agreement that provided
for the withdrawal of some 103,000 Soviet combat troops from
Afghanistan, completed in February of this year. The Red Army
intervened in 1979 to fight the mujahedeen and to replace one
communist government with another.

<HEAD>House Debates Liability For Oil Spills</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House opened debate on comprehensive oil
spill legislation Thursday with members skirmishing over regulatory
powers for states and liability limits for industry.
   Debated for more than a decade but given momentum by the Exxon
Valdez disaster, the proposed legislation would establish a federal
liability and compensation system for damages caused by oil spills
in navigable U.S. waters.
   The bill has broad support, but debate has focused on a
provision that would bar state governments from setting tougher
liability standards than those in the federal legislation.
   Also contested is a provision that would make those responsible
for spills fully liable for damages if grossly negligent.
Environmentalists are pushing an amendment to establish liability
for simple negligence, a lesser standard.
   ``It simply makes no sense, especially now with Prince William
Sound still contamined by oil, to pre-empt the right of state
governments and state legislatures to protect their own people ...
in the way they feel is best,'' said Rep. Gerry Studds, D-Mass.
   But Rep. Norman Shumway, R-Calif., said the federal standards
would be tough enough on oil spillers and that pre-emption of state
laws would ensure a single, comprehensive system.
   ``Without pre-emption, we are going to have a patchwork of
confusing, duplicative and sometimes competing laws that cause
delays and in fact do further damage to the environment because of
the confusion,'' Shumway said.
   Studds has said he will offer an amendment to delete pre-emption
from the bill. Votes on pending amendments and the bill itself were
postponed until next week.
   Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., is expected to offer an amendment
to change the bill's liability threshold from gross negligence to
simple negligence.
   Shumway said he would fight the amendment, describing the bill's
gross negligence standard as a tradeoff with the oil and gas
industry, which under the bill would pay for a $1 billion cleanup
fund.
   The Bush administration supports the bill and says it will
oppose the Studds and Miller amendments.
   If enacted, the bill would establish a fund for spill cleanup
financed through a tax on domestic crude oil and imported petroleum
products. The fund would cover damages to natural resources, injury
to real and personal property, profits and earning capacity.
   A 1986 law provided for a 1.3 cents-per-barrel oil spill tax,
but the House voted this year to boost it to 3 cents.
   The bill would toughen penalties for oil spills and require the
president quickly to mobilize federal resources in the event of a
major spill. Seven regional strike teams would be established to
provide fast cleanup assistance.

   The State Department on Thursday called on

that police death squads assassinated political dissidents.
   The allegations arise from an affidavit signed last month by
Butana Nofemela, a former policeman who claimed he was involved in
killing nine political activists under orders from his superiors.
   Nofemela, who was sentenced to death for the 1987 murder of a
white farmer in a case apparently without political overtones,
received a stay of execution last month from South African
officials based on his affidavit.
   ``We urge President De Klerk to assure that a full and an

   Metal plaques have been placed over the
engraved words ``colored'' and ``white'' on two courthouse
fountains, ending months of public controversy that generated
national interest in the issue.
   The plaques, which read simply ``Jones County Courthouse 1908,''
were bolted to the two fountains on the lawn by order of the Board
of Supervisors.
   ``As long as the wording is not visible, we're going to back
off,'' said Manuel Jones, president of the local chapter of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. ``If
the wording is invisible, we don't have to explain to our kids what
`colored' means.''
   Local and national NAACP leaders had been fighting since January
to have the words covered or the non-working fountains removed.
When the County Board of Supervisors began exploring the issue it
was deluged with calls from constituents saying that the fountains
were a part of the town's history and they didn't want them removed.
   County workers plastered over the words in early April only to
have the plaster washed away by month's end by heavy rains.
   ``Something should have been done way before now,'' Jones said
Wednesday, a day after the plaques were attached. ``It just brought
a whole lot of publicity Jones County didn't need and that the
state of Mississippi didn't need.''
   Before deciding on the plaques, the Board of Supervisors
considered uprooting the fountains from the lawn and sending them
to the state Department of Archives and History in Jackson for
museum display. However, constituents' requests to leave the
fountains there prevailed.
   The plaques meet the criteria of historians for careful
preservation, said Elbert Hilliard, director of the archives
department.

   President Bush has directed that U.S. military

returning to their home bases, the Pentagon announced Thursday.
   The Army troops, about 1,000 military police from several
different posts, will be brought back from the U.S. Virgin Islands
over a 20-day period, said spokesman Fred Hoffman.
   ``It's our understanding that the local authorities have the law

withdraw the American troops ...'' Hoffman said.
   The troops were sent in Sept. 20 in the wake of the deadly
hurricane and the unrest that broke out afterwards.
   According to Mark Wallace, a spokesman for the Federal Emergency
Management Agency in Christiansted, Virgin Islands Gov. Alexander
Farrelly had requested that the troops be removed from the island,
indicating the territorial government feels they were no longer
needed to maintain order.
   A Pentagon source, who spoke on condition of not being

the Virgin Islands National Guard.

   Members of a House subcommittee formally have
admonished Jack Russ, the House sergeant-at-arms, for using ``poor
judgment,'' and for violating procedure when he ordered Capitol
police to arrest his assistant in a bachelor party prank.
   Reps. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio, and Pat Roberts, R-Kan., sent a
letter to Russ chastising him for his conduct and ordering him not
to do it again.
   Oakar and Roberts, the head and ranking member respectively of
the Committee on House Administration's subcommittee on personnel
and police, on Thursday released the contents of a letter they sent
to Russ.
   ``The decision to play a praticial joke under color of your
office was poor judgment,'' the letter said.
   ``In view of this incident we are constrained to admonish you to
examine your decisions and your conduct before, during and
subsequent to the incident, and to make those changes necessary to
ensure that there will be no repetition,'' the letter said.
   House Speaker Tom Foley, D-Wash., said earlier he considered
Russ' conduct a ``lapse of judgment,'' but that the letter had
closed the case. Russ did not return three telephone calls.
   The subcommittee investigated the Sept. 13 incident in which
Russ said he arranged for off-duty Capitol police officers to go to
the bachelor party for Assistant Sergeant-at-Arms Robert Fischer at
a restaurant.
   The Washington Post reported that Fischer was taken, kicking and
screaming, in a police cruiser, to Capitol police headquarters
where he incarcerated briefly.
   ``This incident involving both on and off duty officers,
government equipment and government facilities was improper by all
of these tests,'' according to the letter sent to Russ.
   ``Under no circumstances should government-provided equipment or
resources be used for other than official business nor should the
power of your office be exercised for anything other than official
business,'' it said.

   Pilot error was to blame for the July
crash of a South Korean jetliner in fog near Libya's Tripoli
Airport that killed 80 people, officials said Thursday .
   The Transportation Ministry said flight records of the Korean
Air DC-10 with Libyan aviation experts indicated the pilot had been
told of deteriorating weather but still tried to land.
   ``A careful study of the plane's black box and flight records
showed that the pilot attempted to land in conditions which were
beyond his power,'' said Yoo Han-kyu, chief of the Seoul District
Aviation Control Office.
   The flight, which originated in Seoul and carried 119 people,
crashed into an orchard July 27 after hitting the top of a building
near the Tripoli airport. Eighty people were killed, including six
Libyans on the ground.
   About 25 minutes before the crash, Yoo said, the airport's
control tower advised the pilot to divert to another airport
because visibility had dropped to to 800 yards.
   The plane was kept informed of deteriorating conditions as it
approached the aiport, he said. Visibity was 250 yards 10 minutes
before the crash and 50 yards five minutes before the plane went
down, he said.
   The pilot also was told Tripoli's instrument-landing system had
been out of order for several months, Yoo said.

<HEAD>Coal Strike Spreads in Soviet Arctic; Miners in Donets Meet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A strike spread to most mines in an Arctic coal
region Thursday and some miners blocked shipments in an effort to
force the government to keep promises of improved living and
working conditions.
   Tass said eight of 13 mines in Vorkuta joined the strike at the
largest, the Vorgashor, and miners at nearby Inta voted to walk out
Friday. The official news agency did not say how many miners would
strike at Inta.
   Representatives of miners in the nation's main coal-producing
region, the Donets Basin of the Ukraine, met on Thursday to decide
whether to strike.
   Soviet officials say a drop in coal production could force
rationing of heat and light in the long, severe Russian winter.
   Miners in Vorkuta, north of the Arctic Circle, demand that the
government make good on pledges of better conditions that convinced
thousands of miners to resume work in July at pits they had closed
in the Arctic, Ukraine and Siberia.
   ``Strikers say that, while members of the government report the
fulfillment of some of the points of the resolution, things remain
unchanged in the mining areas,'' Tass reported.
   A regional court in Vorkuta ruled the walkout unlawful, but has
not imposed penalties on the miners, who say they will appeal the
decision to the Supreme Soviet legislature in Moscow.
   At the Komsomolskaya mine, miners continued producing coal but
refused to let it be shipped from Vorkuta, the newspaper
Komsomolskaya Pravda reported. The mine and the paper are named for
Komsomol, the Communist youth league.
   ``We do not expect any special privileges, nor are we depriving
other regions of food, goods or money,'' the paper quoted a miners'
statement as saying. ``All we are asking is that the government,
the Coal Ministry and the union leadership should keep their word.''
   In a separate article, Komsomolskaya Pravda sketched a stark,
sympathetic picture of the miner's lot in the Soviet Arctic, noting
that many do not see daylight for months because of the long winter
nights and their work underground.
   Donets miners gathered outside the House of Unions to demand
that the government set a deadline for keeping its promises and
announce when pensions, longer vacations and other improved
benefits would be provided, Tass reported.

<HEAD>Parents of Boy With Down's Syndrome File Lawsuit Over Box Confinement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The parents of a boy with Down's
syndrome said in a lawlawsuit filed Thursday that he suffered pain
and humiliation when school employees placed him in a wooden box
several times for up to one hour.
   The lawsuit filed by Demar and Dixie Elam said their 7-year-old
son, John, was put in the 2-foot-by-2-foot box in September at a
technical center while he waited for a school bus home.
   The lawsuit said the boy couldn't move anything but his head in
the box and suffered physical pain and humiliation, embarrassment
and mental anguish because other children made fun of him.
   Elam said he ``would not treat an animal'' the way his son was
treated.
   The box, which has an adjustable top that was placed at chin
level for John, is used at Madison County Technical Center during
physical therapy with students in performing such tasks as standing
up.
   The lawsuit names as defendants Rollin Gates and Jan Williams,
two workers at the center, charging them with neglect and-or wanton
supervision, false imprisonment and outrageous conduct.
   Jenny Van Dyke, special education coordinator for Madison County
schools, said the box was not intended as punishment but to keep
John from getting hurt or from running into traffic.
   ``We've tried to say we're sorry, what can we do? We've tried to
correct it,'' she said.
   Mrs. Van Dyke said she has told teachers that such restraints
are not to be used without notifying parents.
   The lawsuit, seeking unspecified damages, said the two workers
placed the boy in the box several times for 40 minutes to one hour
each time. Mrs. Van Dyke said the boy was placed in the box for
only 20 to 25 minutes four or five days.
   Elam said he found his son in the box Sept. 7 and took
photographs, which he presented to school officials. The couple
began driving John to and from school after that.

<TEXT>
   Hungarian reform leader Imre Pozsgay said
Thursday that President Bush views the upcoming Mediterranean
superpower summit as advancing cooperation in Central Europe and
around the world.
   Pozsgay, speaking with reporters after a 30-minute Oval Office
meeting with the president, also said Bush promised to review trade
restrictions that currently keep high-tech products from being
shipped from the West into Hungary and other Soviet-bloc nations.
   Bush already has announced a major relaxation of trade barriers
with Hungary, including extension of most-favored-nation trading
status, to reward recent political reforms there.
   Hungary declared itself a democracy two weeks ago and Pozsgay is
a presidential candidate in elections to be held there later this
month.
   Pozsgay, who holds the title of minister of state, said Bush
``briefed me on what were his motivations regarding the summit.''
   ``He assured us that the whole region and European cooperation
and global cooperation could benefit from that, and naturally it
would be very benefical and advantageous to Hungary,'' Pozsgay said.
   ``All Central European nations can only profit'' from the
strengthening of East-West relations that the December summit
signifies, Pozsgay said through a translator.
   Pozsgay sidestepped a question on whether he would try to take
Hungary out of the Warsaw Pact if he is elected president.
   ``My view is that this is a global European problem that could
be resolved the best way by the elimination of both blocs,'' the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization of western countries and the
Warsaw Pact.
   Asked whether Bush had done enough for Hungary, he said: ``I
believe he has done what he could.''
   The White House issued a statement saying that during the
meeting, Bush ``restated his commitment to the success of Hungary's
democratic reforms, stressing that our support is for the process
of change rather than for any particular party or candidate.''

   The speaker of the Polish parliament said
Thursday he told senior Bush administration and congressional
officials that further delays in economic aid to Poland could help
topple the Solidarity government.
   ``The situation is rather dramatic,'' said Mikolaj Kozakiewicz,
a leader of the Peasants Party and marshal of the lower house of
the Polish Sejm or parliament. Kozakiewicz said he urged U.S.
officials to move more quickly.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa is expected to convey much the
same message during his scheduled visit to Washington this month.
   The Peasants Party last summer split from the Communist Party
coalition in parliament, opening the way for Solidarity activist
Tadeusz Mazowiecki to form the first non-communist government in
Eastern Europe since World War II.
   Kozakiewicz's party remains in the Solidarity coalition,
although there are differences over some policies.
   Congress has appropriated $100 million for food that is en route
to Poland. But further aid is stalled over Republican efforts to
attach to the Polish assistance bill an unrelated amendment to cut
the U.S. capital gains tax.
   Democrats have proposed sending Poland and Hungary $989 million
in aid over three years, while the Republicans have proposed a $585
million package.
   In a related development Thursday, President Bush met with
Hungarian reform leader Minister of State Imre Pozsgay. Bush
``restated his commitment to the success of Hungary's democratic
reforms,'' the White House said.
   Kozakiewicz met Wednesday with Deputy Secretary of State
Lawrence Eagleburger and on Capitol Hill with two sponsors of the
Polish aid package, Senate Majority Whip Alan Cranston, D-Calif.,
and Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill.
   Cranston and Simon, appearing at a luncheon for Kozakiewicz on
Wednesday, said they were continuing efforts to pass the aid
package.
   After the meeting with Eagleburger, the State Department said
the two men ``discussed the current political and economic
situation in Poland as well as the role of foreign assistance from
the West in helping Poles implement their economic programs.''
   Kozakiewicz, speaking with reporters Thursday at the Polish
Embassy, avoided commenting on wrangling between the administration
and Congress.
   But he repeatedly criticized Western governments for not moving
fast enough to get aid to Poland in the pipeline.
   ``All the major countries are all the time elaborating their
programs, but not sending aid,'' he said. West Germany has also
pledged a major aid package, but details may not be clear until
Chancellor Helmut Kohl visits Warsaw next week, he said.
   The delays ``mean that we will be sitting in the middle of
winter with the situation getting harder and harder.''
   The delays dishearten those Poles ``who traditionally trust the
West,'' and prompt ``malicious joy among those who do not trust the
West,'' he said.
   Most Poles still wish success for the first non-Communist
government in Poland since World War II, but they are running out
of food, heating coal, medical supplies and other necessities,
Kozakiewicz said.
   In addition to sending aid to Poland, the administration has
authorized the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC)
to insure American businessmen seeking to invest in Poland. The
insurance would protect Americans against the risk the Polish
government would change and expropriate their investment, said OPIC
spokesman James V. Hall.
   Fred M. Zeder, president of OPIC, will lead a delegation to
Poland on Monday to review 250 projects there that need private
investment, said Hall. About 25 companies are expected to send
representatives with Zeder.

<HEAD>Agreement Reached on Defense Bill Cutting $1.1 Billion for Star Wars</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDs: New thruout with comment, detail on SDI total, F-14D provision.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Congressional negotiators on Thursday approved
a $305 billion defense bill that slashes $1.1 billion from
President Bush's Strategic Defense Initiative and eliminates one
B-2 stealth bomber.
   The plan, the product of nearly eight weeks of wrangling between
House and Senate conferees, provides much of Bush's request for
land-based nuclear missiles and restores some funds for two
conventional-arms programs the president sought to kill.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said he was ``generally pleased''
with the bill because it ``authorizes funds for effective
modernization of our strategic forces.'' He expressed some
disappointment, however, over the cut in the SDI request.
   ``I would have preferred a higher level of funding for SDI,''
the defense secretary, in Australia for bilateral talks, said in a
statement released by the Pentagon.
   Sen. John Warner of Virginia, ranking Republican on the Armed
Services Committee, said he expects the president to sign the bill
once it passes the House and Senate.
   ``Apart from SDI, on the whole it's one which we find
acceptable,'' Warner said of the bill.
   The legislation provides $3.57 billion for SDI, popularly known
as Star Wars, in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1 _ about $200
million less than the amount spent in fiscal 1989 and the first
decrease in funds since former President Reagan proposed the
anti-missile shield six years ago.
   Adding $220 million for related Energy Department programs, the
final total for Star Wars is $3.79 billion, which falls between the
$2.8 billion approved by the House and the $4.3 billion adopted by
the Senate.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services Committee,
said the cut in Star Wars spending reflected diminishing
congressional support for a program whose mission the Bush
administration has not defined.
   ``They've changed the program so many times and the architecture
has never been really a fixed architecture, by that I mean the plan
and how they're going to use it,'' Nunn told reporters.
   Despite the overall agreement, there still were complaints from
lawmakers about the package.
   ``We're buying too many big-ticket items with no hard choices,''
said Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, a member of the House Armed Services
Committee who complained aobut the restoration of funds for the
V-22 Osprey and the F-14D jet fighter.
   ``What we have to show for weeks of wheeling and dealing in
conference is an outrageous compromise corrupted by political and
parochial avarice,'' said Rep. Larry J. Hopkins, R-Ky.
   The negotiators' agreement, which still must be approved by the
full House and Senate, includes approximately $1.1 billion for the
rail-based MX multiple-warhead missile and the truck-based
Midgetman single-warhead missile, about $150 million less than Bush
had requested for the two nuclear weapons.
   Cheney had favored financing only the MX, but Bush opted for the
two land-based missiles, with $1.1 billion for the MX and $100
million for the Midgetman.
   The bill also includes House language imposing a 50-missile cap
on the MX.
   The budget for the MX and Midgetman drew complaints Wednesday
from four House members, including three chairmen of Armed Services
subcommittees.
   ``We feel that the proposed deal on the B-2, Strategic Defense
Initiative and mobile ICBMs is inadequate and we cannot sign the
conference report in its present form,'' the four said in a letter
to Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the Armed Services panel.
   Signing the letter were Reps. Charles Bennett, D-Fla. and
chairman of the House Armed Services subcommittee on seapower and
strategic and critical materials; Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo. and
chairman of the subcommittee on military installations and
facilities; Ronald Dellums, D-Calif. and chairman of the
subcommittee on research and development; and Lane Evans, D-Ill.
and a member of the full panel.
   The agreement also provides funds for two B-2 stealth bombers in
fiscal 1990, one less than the Bush administration proposed, and
money for components for five in fiscal 1991. The bat-winged
aircraft has come under congressional criticism in the last year
for its expensive price tag of $530 million apiece.
   The negotiators agreed to restore some money for the two
conventional-arms programs Bush sought to cancel _ the Marine
Corps' Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft and the Navy's F-14D Tomcat.
   The Osprey, an aircraft that takes off like a helicopter but can
fly like a plane, will receive about $255 million in research and
development money but no funds for procurement. The future of the
program would be tied to commercial use of the plane.
   The legislation also includes a provision calling for the
purchase of 18 F-14D fighters in fiscal 1990 but none in fiscal
1991, a decision which is viewed by many lawmakers as a ``golden
parachute'' for the manufacturer, Grumman Corp., of New York.
   While the future of the Osprey rests with commercial
application, the bill requires Grumman to sign a contract to end
future production of the F-14D, referred to by Warner as a ``poison
pill.''

   Pentagon Tells Congress of Arms Sale to Pakistan

   The Pentagon informed Congress on Thursday
that Pakistan intends to buy four Phalanx weapons systems, a type
of Gatling gun used as a last-ditch defense against anti-ship
missiles.
   The estimated cost of the five-inch gun systems, which also
include ammunition, logistical support and training, amounts to $29
million, the Pentagon said in a statement.
   The weapons will provide a surface-to-air defensive capability
for frigates in the Pakistani Navy and will be in addition to the
earlier versions of the weapons systems that have been delivered to
their forces, the Pentagon said.
   The Pentagon also said that Pakistan intends to buy 13
Firefinder counter-mortar radar sets, 26 AN@VRC-46 radios and
logistical support at a cost of $65 million.
   The sale of both types of equipment will not affect the basic
military balance in the region, the Pentagon statement said.

   Ricky Jenkins was 7 when he removed a
pistol from his mother's purse and shot himself in the throat. This
week, his 5-year-old son took a pistol from a kitchen table and
killed his uncle.
   ``I just want parents to know that children don't know; they
don't know that a loaded gun can kill,'' Jenkins, 28, said. ``I
just want parents to know the danger they put their family in by
leaving loaded guns around.
   ``Those things happen, and all you can say is you're sorry, when
you could have been more responsible,'' he said.
   The shooting Sunday morning killed Jenkins' brother, John Evans,
33. Ricky Jenkins and his son were staying at Evans' apartment and
the 5-year-old was the first one awake Sunday morning. Police said
they did not know why the brothers had different last names.
   Evans had left the gun and some papers on the kitchen table
after cleaning out cabinets Saturday, and the shiny pistol
apparently sparked the child's curiosity, Jenkins said.
   Evans, who was asleep on the living room floor at the time, was
shot once in the upper torso with a .25-caliber semiautomatic
pistol. He got up, staggered out of the apartment and collapsed.
   Evans was pronounced dead less than an hour later.
   ``He picked it up, started playing with it and fired the gun
once,'' Sgt. Tommy Kelly of the Pine Bluff Police Department said.
``Guns are real interesting to small kids, and even if they have
been instructed not to mess with the weapons, a kid is going to
play with guns because they fascinate them.''
   Ricky Jenkins said that when he was 7, ``I was playing with a
gun and I shot myself. And I still have the bullet in me.''

<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United Nations resumed relief flights
from Kenya to southern Sudan Thursday after a 24-hour suspension
following the bombing of a rebel-held town.
   Four people were killed in Tuesday's bombing of Yirol in Sudan's
southern Bahr el Ghazal province, 625 miles southwest of the
capital Khartoum, a U.N. source said.
   The Sudan People's Liberation Army clandestine radio said the
government bombed the town and swore revenge on the nation's
military strongman, Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan el-Bashir.
   ``The SPLA assures ... el-Bashir that his indiscriminate and
barbaric bombing of Yirol will not go long unpunished,'' the radio
said. ``Every war-mongering madness of el-Bashir will be quickly
met by a swift, iron-fisted retaliation that will cost the regime
another garrison town.''
   It said four civilians were killed and six civilians wounded.
   The U.N. source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
flights from Lokichoggio in northern Kenya _ suspended Wednesday _
resumed after safeguards were implemented involving radio contact
with relief personnel in southern Sudan and assurances the planes
would be met on arrival.
   The planes are part of a U.N.-coordinated operation that has
moved 107,000 tons of food and supplies into southern Sudan since
April in an effort to avert a repeat of last year's tragedy when an
estimated 250,000 people died of starvation.
   Until last week, government forces and rebels had observed a de
facto cease-fire in their nearly 7-year-old war in southern Sudan
to facilitate movement of relief supplies.
   However, hostilities appear to be on the rise. The Yirol bombing
came four days after rebels seized a town on Ethiopia's border
following days of fighting.

the sale will ``improve the security of a friendly country which

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon said on Thursday that it informed
Congress of a $3.1 billion arms purchase by Saudi Arabia, touching
off a 30-day period in which Capitol Hill can reject the deal.
   The sale, which was reported in the media several weeks ago, has
touched off little opposition among lawmakers.
   In the past, Congress has rejected several U.S. arms sales to
Arab countries out of concern for Israel's security.
   But political maneuvering in recent weeks managed to diffuse the
concerns that customarily touch off strong opposition to U.S. deals
with Arab countries technically at war with Israel.
   ``The sale of this equipment and support will not affect the
basic military balance in the region,'' the Pentagon said in a
statement.
   It includes 315 M1A2 tanks, but two-thirds of the price tag _
which is equivalent to a year's U.S. aid to Israel _ is the cost of
equipment and ammunition, including huge trucks to transport any
tanks that break down.
   The sale also includes the design and construction of
maintenance facilities for the vehicles, the Pentagon said.
   The statement did not say where the tanks would be based.
   Several House members have written Secretary of State James A.
Baker III asking further consultations and raising some questions
about the sale, and Baker promised to provide assurances the arms
were necessary for the Saudi defense.
   With the formal notification, Congress has 30 days either to
kill the deal by majority votes in the Senate and House or let it
go through.
   The Saudis are to receive the tanks beginning in the middle of
the next decade, about the same time the U.S. Army would field
them. Israel has a comparable tank, the Merkava.
   To smooth congressional approval, the Bush administration agreed
not to equip the Saudi tanks with plates of uranium armor, a much
denser metal than steel.
   If some are deployed at the Tabuk military base the tanks would
be only 120 miles from Israel. Others may be based near Kuwait, and
still others at an armored training school near Mecca.

   Nicaraguan forces were responsible for the
deaths of 74 Contra supporters in the northern part of the country
between 1987 and early 1989, a human rights group said in a report
released Thursday.
   Americas Watch, a private group based in New York, also said
Sandinista authorities were to blame for the disappearance of 14
others thought to support the rebels.
   On the other hand, Americas Watch said in a separate report that
the claim by State Department and Nicaraguan opposition groups that
5,000 to 7,000 Nicaraguans are being detained for political
offenses is ``patently false.''
   The report said the total of such prisoners is not significantly
greater than the 1,306 estimated by the International Committee for
the Red Cross last August.
   Americas Watch, which often has been critical of abuses by the
Nicaraguan Contras in previous reports, said the Sandinista record
in investigating the alleged killings is mixed.
   Some cases have resulted in convictions and punishment but
others have not, the report said.
   According to the report, Americas Watch researchers discovered
20 other possible killings in addition to the 74 but it said the
information on these cases was incomplete.
   It said the vast majority of the killings took place in the
remote mountains of northern Nicaragua.
   ``The concentration of so many cases in a particular geographic
area in this period led us to conclude that these killings
constituted a pattern, and could not be dismissed as isolated or
sporadic,'' it said.
   The pattern indicates that regional military or security forces
engaged in selective kidnappings and assassinations of persons
suspected of being Contra collaborators or couriers, it said.
   ``In most cases, bodies were found within hours or days, and in
many cases those corpses showed signs of brutal torture,'' the
report added.

<HEAD>Abortion Foes Complain Ads Turned Down in Virginia Governor Race</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Right To Life Committee said
Thursday that television stations have refused to air commercials
it has produced attacking the Democratic candidate for governor in
Virginia.
   Spokeswoman Nancy Myers said the ads were rejected by eight
Virginia-area stations, including five that are airing opposing ads
produced by the National Abortion Rights Action League.
   The rejected ads attack Virginia Democratic nominee Douglas
Wilder, who has made his opposition to restrictions on abortion a
central focus of his campaign along with his contention that
Republican opponent Marshall Coleman wants to take away women's
rights to choose. The ads endorse Coleman.
   The election is Tuesday.
   Ms. Myers contended that the ads were factual and said officials
at the stations gave ``outrageous reasons'' for refusing them.
Among the reasons, she said, was that they objected to the tone of
the narrator's voice, in one case, and to an assertion that
Wilder's campaign was based on the abortion issue.
   ``These stations are saying that we can't talk about the issue
of abortion unless we use the other side's terminology and
rhetoric,'' she said. ``That's television censorship, and it's
outrageous.''
   A third ad describing Coleman's opposition to abortion has been
accepted by several of the stations, as have general ads on the
abortion issue that do not directly address the Virginia governor's
race, said executive director David O'Steen.
   John Long, executive vice president and general manager of WJLA
in Washington, said his television station rejected the ads because
the group had not provided substantiation ``to our satisfaction''
for their assertions.
   ``There's just an awful lot of inference, too much inference, in
those spots,'' Long said. ``We've asked them to substantiate. Where
do they get those facts? ... If they supply the facts, we'll put
them on the air.''
   Ms. Myers said the group intended to spend $150,000 airing the
ads. Because of the refusal, she said, they will probably air
$100,000 worth. The ads are being aired on seven stations plus some
cable-only stations, she said.
   The abortion-rights group, NARAL, has aired $300,000 worth of
ads attacking Coleman's anti-abortion position, spokeswoman Loretta
Ucelli said.
   She said the abortion-rights group was refused airtime on some
Washington stations that reject advocacy-group ads in general, and
that other stations required written substantiation of the facts
stated in the ads.
   ``We went through the process and they accepted them,'' Ms.
Ucelli said.

<HEAD>Parents of Boy Run Over by Bus Urge Better Mirrors</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The parents of a boy run over and killed by
the school bus he had been riding moments before appealed to
Congress Thursday to prevent the deaths of other children who stray
into ``blind spots'' not covered by the driver's mirrors.
   ``As sure as I'm standing here, there will be another child run
over by his school bus _ because he couldn't be seen _ before this
year is ended,'' Thomas Peterson of Howell, Mich., told a House
subcommittee.
   ``We cannot believe that any school system would risk the lives
of children for the sake of the extra dollars that adequate mirrors
would cost,'' said Peterson, whose 6-year-old son, Matthew, died in
1984 after he walked in front of his school bus and was struck as
it pulled away.
   Peterson and his wife, Kathy, appeared before the House Energy
and Commerce subcommittee on transportation and hazardous materials
to urge passage of a bill sponsored by Rep. Dennis Eckart, D-Ohio,
giving the federal government a deadline for toughening standards
for school bus mirrors.
   Those standards now require only one mirror reflecting one foot
in front of the bus; most states require two mirrors.
   Even with two mirrors, however, there's a large ``blind spot''
where a driver is unable to see a child directly in front of the
bus and on either side of it if he is within a foot of the vehicle.
   Eckart's bill would require special mirrors that eliminate
``blind spots.'' The mirrors, he and manufacturers estimate, would
cost about $100 per bus.
   Jeffrey Miller, acting administrator of the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration, said the legislation is unnecessary
because the agency has already begun revising the rules to improve
a driver's visibility and require swing-out ``stop'' sign
attachments, now mandatory in 28 states.
   New standards could be in place in 14 months, Miller told the
hearing.
   But the chairman of the panel, Rep. Thomas Luken, D-Ohio, said
that's not good enough and the federal agency hasn't acted fast
enough.
   NHTSA is ``inherently, inately lethargic,'' he told Miller. ``I
think your comments here are that you're going to continue to be
lethargic.''
   A member of the National PTA board told the panel her meetings
with the NHTSA left her convinced the agency didn't consider the
issue a top priority. ``NHTSA's attitude was one of a `big yawn' _
insensitive and apathetic,'' said Millie Waterman of Mentor, Ohio.
   ``Today we're going to wake NHTSA up,'' promised Luken.
   On average, 26 children are killed and 470 children are injured
each year in the moments after getting off a school bus, according
to a report issued in May by a research arm of the National Academy
of Sciences. In each case, the children walked, ran or chased a
dropped object near the bus but outside the driver's field of
vision.
   Mrs. Waterman's husband, Harry, told Luken's subcommittee that
when he was in charge of transportation for Mentor's public schools
he installed state-of-the-art mirrors for about $100 a bus that
erased driver blind spots.
   The mirrors make the area in front of the bus and underneath the
front bumper visible to the drivers.

<HEAD>Leftist Opposition Leaders Arrested</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Three leftist leaders were arrested
after signing a statement calling on Haitians to rally against the
government of Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, a private radio station said
Thursday.
   Radio Antilles said Jean-Auguste Mesyeux, Evans Paul and Etienne
Marino were arrested Wednesday night in suburban Carrefour by
police trailing their car. Mesyeux is co-leader of Haiti's biggest
union, the Autonomous Central of Haitian Workers.
   On Tuesday, more than 20 organizations that make up the
opposition coalition called National Assembly co-signed a statement
calling for a monthlong ``general mobilization'' against the
government, including marches and distribution of leaflets. The
three men were among the signers.
   The National Assembly includes the Haitian Communist Party and
the parties of major conservatives such as Louis Dejoie, Hubert De
Ronceray, and Sylvio Claude. It has denounced austerity measures
and alleged human rights abuses by the regime.
   ``The government is out of its mind. Instead of realizing how
unpopular its policies are, it is cracking down on popular
organizations,'' Dejoie told The Associated Press Thursday.
   Paul is leader of the Confederation of Democratic Unity party
and Marino heads the Sept. 17 Popular Organization, a group
inspired by the September 1988 soldiers' revolt that ousted
dictator Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy and brought Avril to power.
   Joseph Maxi, president of the Haitian Human Rights League, said
three presidential guardsmen entered his Carrefour home Wednesday
night searching for former guardsman Frantz Patrick Beauchard, a
member of Marino's group.
   Maxi said Beauchard asked him for legal help ``because he felt
his security was threatened.'' Beauchard was jailed for two months
and expelled from the army in December 1988 for allegedly plotting
to overthrow the government.

   Israeli officials said Thursday they found
``positive movement'' in changes the United States made in its
proposal for negotiations between Israel and Palestinians.
   Government spokesmen said Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and
other leaders would meet Friday to discuss the changes, which
Israel radio said included assurances that known PLO members would
not be allowed to participate.
   President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, the only Arab nation to sign a
peace treaty with Israel, conferred in Cairo with Yasser Arafat,
chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   When the PLO has developed a position on the U.S. plan, he said,
Egypt ``will sponsor it in our talks with the United States and
Israel.''
   Arafat did not comment on the U.S. plan but praised Mubarak for
offering to host Palestinian-Israeli talks in Cairo, a proposal
that Israel has rejected.
   ``We thank and support the initiative that President Mubarak
proposed about holding a Palestinian-Israeli dialogue in Egypt in
preparation of an international Middle East peace conference later,
God willing,'' Arafat said.
   In the occupied West Bank, Israeli soldiers shot an 18-year-old
Palestinian to death. Fellow Arabs in a prison camp killed a
36-year-old Palestinian suspected of collaborating with Israeli
authorities, the army said.
   In the Gaza Strip, a military jeep struck Wadieh Ali Salem Deeb,
28, as he was riding his bicycle, Arab reports said. The army
confirmed Deeb later died in Shifa Hospital, but said none of its
vehicles were involved in the accident.
   Israeli soldiers or civilians have killed at least 608
Palestinian since an uprising began 23 months ago in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip, and 40 Israelis have died. Fellow Arabs
have killed 139 Palestinians, most of them on suspicion of
collaboration.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III agreed Wednesday to some
changes in the U.S. plan for preliminary peace talks between Israel
and Palestinians.
   Israel radio said the new version included assurances against
PLO participation and acceptance of Israel's right to boycott the
meeting if it did not accept the members of the Palestinian
delegation.
   In Washington, a State Department official confirmed privately
that Baker telephoned Foreign Minister Moshe Arens on Wednesday to
discuss the plan, which Israel had rejected.
   ``He looked at the wording and may have made some changes, but
he didn't change the basic thrust,'' the official said. ``If that
makes (it) more welcome, then good.''
   Baker's objective is to convene a preliminary meeting between
Israel and Palestinians to revive an Israeli proposal that calls
for elections in the occupied territories to choose representatives
to negotiate limited autonomy with Israel. He suggested the meeting
take place in Cairo.
   Avi Pazner, an adviser to Shamir, said the prime minister would
meet on Friday with Arens, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin and
Finance Minister Shimon Peres.
   An Israeli government official said, on condition of anonymity:
``The fact that Israel's view was taken into consideration is proof
there is movement and it is positive.''
   The changes appeared to fall short of Israel's requests. In a
letter to Baker last week, Arens said Israel wanted the right to
veto individual members of the Palestinian delegation and limit the
talks to the Israeli election proposal.
   ``It seems to me the situation is better when it comes to
wording then it was,'' said Ehud Olmert, a government minister from
Shamir's Likud bloc. ``That doesn't mean we should jump to
conclusions that everything is fine, but it certainly makes it
easier.''
   The 18-year-old killed Thursday in the West Bank was identified
by the army as Nasser Swati Halima of Beit Awwa. The army said he
was masked and burning tires at the town's entrance soldiers
ordered him to stop.
   ``The youngster tried to throw a backpack toward the officers,
who shot toward his legs,'' the army statement said.
   It said the other killing occurred in the Ketziot military
prison in the Negev desert. The army identified the victim as Jabr
Ahmad Nimer Sider of Gaza City and said his attacker was an
18-year-old Palestinian from Gaza.
   Palestinians in the occupied lands closed their shops Thursday
and and transportation was halted by a strike called by the Islamic
fundamentalist movement named Hamas, or Zeal.
   It marked the anniversary of the 1917 Balfour Declaration, in
which Britain called for a Jewish national homeland in Palestine.

   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's government on
Thursday protested the appointment of a new chief of mission at the
U.S. Embassy, saying the diplomat was not accredited.
   The Foreign Ministry statement also said several American
diplomats are on an ``irregular'' status in Panama.
   The protest followed the announcement that John Bushnell, former
deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Argentina, has been
named charge d'affaires at the U.S. Embassy.
   Bushnell, 59, a former staff member of the National Security
Council and former deputy assistant secretary for inter-American
affairs, also served in Colombia, the Dominican Republic and
Switzerland.
   He replaced John Maisto, who has been named the alternate U.S.
representative to the Organization of American States.
   The statement mentioned Bushnell by name and said his status and
those of other American diplomats ``is irregular, since their
function is to represent a government with which Panama does not
maintain normal relations.''
   The United States has refused to recognize the government since
February 1988, when federal grand juries in Florida indicted
Noriega on drug trafficking and money laundering charges and issued
warrants for his arrest.
   The United States imposed economic sanctions and has exerted
diplomatic pressure to remove Noriega from power.
   Soon after the indictments, President Eric Arturo Delvalle fired
Noriega as Defense Forces chief, but the Noriega-controlled
national legislature dismissed Delvalle instead. The Bush
administration has maintained that Delvalle is Panama's legitimate
head of state.
   Maisto was accredited three years ago, so the issue did not come
up until his replacement by Bushnell earlier this week.
   The United States withdrew Ambassador Arthur Davis to protest
Noriega's cancellation of the May 7 national election, in which
international observers said opposition candidate Guillermo Endara
defeated the government candidate by a landslide.
   On Sept. 1, Noriega named Francisco Rodriguez, a close friend,
as provisional president.
   Opposition groups insist that Endara won and should become the
next president.

   President Bush ordered his helicopter, Marine

Thursday so that a Coast Guard emergency medical copter could land.
   Bush had flown to the hospital from the White House to visit
ailing former Salvadoran President Jose Napoleon Duarte.
   The president was talking with reporters outside Walter Reed
when the Coast Guard helicopter began circling, unable to land
because Bush's craft was still parked there.
   ``Excuse me, got an emergency coming in on the chopper,'' Bush
said, abruptly ending the session with reporters.
   He climbed into in his limosene and ordered Marine One to take
off empty, according to presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   The Coast Guard copter was rushing Coast Guard Petty Officer
Daniel Willis to Walter Reed from Cape May, N.J., to treat an acute
case of kidney stones, Fitzwater said.
   The medivac copter deposited its passenger and then left. Marine
One landed and picked up Bush.

<HEAD>Inventer of Ultrasonic Gun Testifies at Race Fraud Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The inventor of an ultra-sound gun used to stun a
racehorse in an alleged plot to launder drug money through sure
bets testified Thursday he was told it would make his fortune.
   ``I had someone tell me that if I had a device like this, I
would not have to work again,'' auto dealer James Laming told a
criminal court. ``This was someone fairly high up in the racing
world, and the gambling game.''
   Laming, 49, would not name the man, who he said had no direct
involvement with the weapon.
   He was giving evidence 16 months after the thoroughbred Ile de
Chypre veered suddenly across the track while leading an important
English race, apparently stunned by an ultrasonic-sound gun
disguised as a pair of binoculars.
   The sound emitted from the grandstand, inaudible to humans,
stunned the horse and caused it to toss veteran jockey Greville
Starkey.
   Prosecutors say the ultrasonic device was the centerpiece of a
plan in which narcotics profits would be laundered at tracks
through bets guaranteed by use of the gun.
   Laming denies charges of cocaine possession and conspiring to
distribute the drug. He claims his association with confessed drug
Peruvian drug dealer Rene Black was based only on the invention.
   Earlier in the trial, the court was told how Laming's brother,
standing at the grandstand rail, used the device on Ile de Chypre
during the King George V Handicap at Ascot on June 16, 1988. The
horse was leading by three lengths less than 150 yards from the
finish.
   Jonathan Goldberg, Laming's lawyer, told the court Tuesday the
plan was to ``undermine the the entire system of racecourse betting
and bookmaking in this country.''
   On Thursday, Laming was asked what that meant.
   ``It meant taking out a horse,'' he said.
   Asked whether he understood what would be achieved by taking out
one horse in a race, Laming said: ``I thought it would have
advantages for the betting.''
   Prosecutor Andrew Mitchell asked Laming how he interested Black
in the device, when the inventor himself did not appear to
understand how it could be used in betting.
   ``I am not one for theatrical performance, but I believe the
fact that the device was unique helped,'' Laming replied. ``He was
extremely interested in the fact that I could take out horses.''
   He also said Black was a former show jumper and thought of
reviving his own career by using the gun against competitors.

   In its quest for survival, the Polish

   Two blacks convicted of murder
were hanged at Pretoria Central Prison on Thursday, and
anti-apartheid activists launched a solidarity campaign on behalf
of other prisoners on Death Row.
   Hanged were Million Hlahla, 44, and Timothy Lubisi, 28,
convicted in 1987 of robbing and killing a white man enticed into
roadside bushes by two female accomplices.
   That raised the number of executions in South Africa so far this
year to 49 _ all black or mixed-race except for two whites.
   Anti-apartheid activists told a news conference a rally will be
held Monday to mark the 25th anniversary of the first hangings of
African National Congress guerrillas. The outlawed ANC turned to
violence in 1961 in its efforts to overthrow the white-dominated
government and its policy of racial segregation.
   ``These were the first of a long line of political executions of
prisoners of war in our country,'' said a statement issued by the
Mass Democratic Movement, a coalition of opposition groups.
   Trade union official Mike Mdladla called the death penalty a
crime against humanity and said it should be abolished.

<TEXT>
   The state's corrections chief said
Thursday the warden of a prison rocked by two nights of rioting
last week would not be paid during his suspension, but he refused
to comment on the disciplinary move.
   The suspension of Robert M. Freeman came hours after The
Associated Press reported Wednesday that, according to guards,
prison officials had ignored broken cell locks after the first
night of violence.
   Commissioner of Corrections David S. Owens Jr. refused to
elaborate on what prompted the suspension. Freeman, a 19-year
veteran of the corrections system who has headed the prison since
1984, could not be reached for comment. He has an unlisted phone
number.
   But Owens said Thursday that Freeman's suspension will be
without pay and will run until a special governor's commission
reports its findings on or before Dec. 1.
   Prison spokesman Kenneth Robinson would not say whether the AP
report was related to the suspension.
   The fiery rioting left more than a dozen buildings destroyed at
the prison five miles west of Harrisburg. Thirteen prison staffers
were held hostage at various points during the two riots; a total
of 123 people were injured.
   The medium-security prison was calm and locked down Thursday,
the Corrections Department said in a statement.
   Guards told the AP this week that during the first riot, inmates
removed metal covers from lock control boxes that run along the
walls above each tier of cells. The next night, inmates reached out
of their cells and pushed two-inch levers in the boxes to free
themselves, allowing the rampage to start anew, guards said.
   Since last Friday, about 877 inmates have been transferred to
other state and federal prisons. Another 50 inmates were to be sent
Thursday to the federal penitentiary at Lewisburg, Pa.
   When the riots first broke out, the prison was nearly 45 percent
over capacity, with 2,600 inmates in a 52-acre complex intended for
1,820.
   About 20 relatives of Camp Hill inmates met with prison
spokesman Robinson on Thursday and sought either visits or answers
to questions about the inmates. Robinson said visits were
impossible. Some families later met with an aide to Gov. Robert P.
Casey.
   Sen. Stewart J. Greenleaf, chairman of the state Senate
Judiciary Committee which grilled Owens for answers on Tuesday,
said he was surprised that Freeman had been suspended so soon after
Owens told the committee he couldn't answer questions about the
riots.
   ``Either Owens didn't reveal all information or he didn't bother
to take steps to find out,'' said Greenleaf. ``He's got easier
access to those guards than the AP or our committee.''
   Greenleaf said he was bothered that Owens would not give guards
blanket freedom to testify. The senator said guards were worried
about their jobs and Owens would not promise that guards could
testify without fear of being disciplined.
   Prison spokesman John A. Palakovich said he could not comment on
the guards' allegations because an investigation is pending.
   Sen. Jeanette Reibman, a member of the state Senate Judiciary
Committee which questioned Owens about the riots, said she agrees
with the suspension.
   ``If what the guards are saying is so, then on the basis of that
knowledge the superintendent was suspended, and that was the right
action to take,'' Reibman said.

   Republican J. Marshall Coleman charged
Thursday that his Democratic opponent for governor, L. Douglas
Wilder, is being judged by a ``double standard'' in his bid to
become the nation's first elected black governor.
   Coleman said Wilder, the lieutenant governor, receives favorable
treatment from the press, but he stopped short of identifying race
as the reason.
   ``I don't know what the reason is,'' Coleman said during a
heated 30-minute news conference at the state Capitol. ``All I know
is I see it because I am on the receiving end of it.''
   ``I don't think it matters how much history Doug Wilder's
election Tuesday would make,'' said Coleman, a former attorney
general. ``He has to meet the same high standards that Virginians
have always demanded of their governors.''
   Laura Dillard, Wilder's press secretary, said Coleman's remarks
were ``offensive and will sicken the voters of Virginia. ... I am
offended that Marshall Coleman is so desperate that he would
suggest that.''
   Ms. Dillard said Wilder has been thoroughly scrutinized by the
press. ``I will leave it to others to conclude what is behind'' the
double-standard claim, she said.
   A poll published last weekend in The Washington Post showed
Coleman trailing Wilder by 15 percentage points.
   At the news conference, Coleman introduced the subject by
saying: ``Many of you have asked me in recent days whether I think
there is a double standard involved where Mr. Wilder is concerned.''
   ``I will give you an answer,'' he added.
   Coleman then listed seven points, among them Wilder's reprimand
by the Virginia Supreme Court in 1978 for mishandling a case;
sponsoring legislation to pay money to a client who was threatening
a malpractice lawsuit; housing code violations by property Wilder
owned; and charging fees for speeches to state groups after his
election to the state's No. 2 office in 1985.
   In such cases, Coleman said, if he had been the offender he
would be ``laughed out of the contest'' and ``not be in the
running.''
   ``But, for the most part, members of the news media have treated
these examples of dishonesty and corruption as minor foibles,'' he
said.
   Coleman called the news conference and invited Wilder to attend
to explain the tape, which contains comments Wilder made to United
Mine Workers at a private meeting last summer.
   On the tape, Wilder said he would support amending the state's
right-to-work law, which forbids compulsory union membership, to
allow labor contracts under which non-union members would pay dues
to the union that negotiated the agreement.
   After the tape was released Tuesday, Wilder said he would veto
any effort to weaken the right-to-work law and said the tape did
not contradict that position.
   Coleman said the tape shows that Wilder is ``so lacking in
personal integrity that he would take two positions at once.''
   Wilder, who said he saw no need to attend the Coleman news
conference, responded that he told the miners he would oppose any
weakening of the right-to-work law.
   According to a transcript of the meeting, Wilder told the miners
several times he supports the law and that there is no chance of
repealing it. But when he was asked whether he supported the
proposed amendment, Wilder responded, ``That's correct,'' the
transcript said.
   Wilder went Wednesday to the College of William &amp; Mary in
Williamsburg, where he faced hecklers who shouted ``Why do you
lie?'' at a student rally.
   The handful of Republican students in the crowd of several
hundred students at the rally also carried signs that read, ``Doug,
Your Nose Is Growing'' and ``Lies, Wilder and Audiotape.''
   ``I didn't come here to answer mud,'' Wilder said between shouts.

<HEAD>FCC Chairman Urges Newspapers To Join Phone Companies In Electronic
Publishing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newspapers should join, not fight, telephone
companies in the electronic publishing field, a top federal
regulator told a newspaper publishers meeting Thursday.
   Alfred Sikes, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission,
said newspapers could use their publishing experience to boost the
nation's telecommunications infrastructure and help assure that
Americans derive the same ``information age'' benefits that other
nations are beginning to enjoy.
   ``I think there's a good opportunity today for publishing
companies to capitalize on their experience and move into
electronic delivery of their product,'' Sikes told a meeting of the
American Newpaper Publishers Association.
   ``Obviously, the American newspaper industry understands that
videotext services will ultimately have a significant impact on
your industry,'' Sikes said, noting newspaper opposition to
telephone companies providing such service. ``I would like to
suggest, however, that as lines of demarcation blur, partnerships
can often work better than rear guard actions.''
   Electronic publishing includes computer-based data and voice
messaging services and advertising programs such as electronic
Yellow Pages.
   The seven regional Bell operating companies were barred in the
1984 breakup of the American Telephone and Telegraph Co. from
entering the so-called information services industry out of fear
they would use their huge resources to kill competition.
   But U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene, who oversaw the
AT&amp;T divestiture, later said the Bell companies may provide
voice-messaging services and also act as ``gateways'' by providing
single phone numbers that will reach multiple information service
providers. The Bells still cannot offer the information services
themselves.
   The ANPA opposes the Bell companies' entry into electronic
publishing as long as the Bells have monopoly control of the local
telephone networks. The ANPA believes many of the Bell companies
have resisted fully developing the gateways in hopes of dismantling
the line-of-business prohibitions in the 1984 AT&amp;T consent decree.
   Congress and the White House are considering whether to lift
some of those restrictions on the Bell companies, and Sikes, during
his confirmation hearings earlier this year, told Congress he
supported lifting the line-of-business prohibitions.
   Major U.S. electronic publishers already include Knight-Ridder,
Dow Jones and Reuters, and Sikes, in his address Thursday, said
newspaper-telephone company partnerships ``make sense, since each
would bring complementary talents to the bargain.''
   ``The underlying rationale of the many mergers in today's
communications market is that there are real synergies available
from product line to product line and by viewing software, hardware
and distribution assets as complementary,'' he said.
   Sikes said European publishers such as France's Hachette
organization have been working with France Telecom to develop its
Minitel videotext system. He noted these companies already have
entered the North American market in Montreal and Dallas, where
``they should have something of a competitive edge'' already.
   ``We want to make sure that America's leading firms have some
degree of competitive parity,'' Sikes said.
   ``It seems to me you might want to concentrate increasingly on
helping assure a fair and rational regulatory framework within
which this country's full resources can be utilized,'' Sikes said.
``There are logical options reasonably available here, including
efforts to blend the complementary talents of the publishing and
telephone industries.''

<HEAD>Austria to Ask Compensation from Hungary in Dam Project</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Austria said Thursday it will ask $300
million in damages from Hungary, which decided this week to stop
work on a Danube River hydroelectric project.
   Economics Minister Wolfgang Schuessel said the halt was
considered a breach of contract by the state-owned Austrian
contractor Donaukraftwerke, which was doing 70 percent of the work
on the Hungarian part of the $3 billion joint project with
Czechoslovakia.
   He said the government would ask 4 billion schillings in
compensation.
   Austrian state companies contracted to build much of the
Hungarian power complex at Nagymaros in return for future power
supplies.
   Tuesday's vote in the Hungarian parliament to stop work, which
is near completion on the Czechoslovak side, came five months after
Hungary declared a moratorium because of mounting costs and fear of
environmental damage.
   Czechoslovakia, a conservative Warsaw Pact ally displeased by
Hungary's turn toward democracy, also demands compensation. Its
Communist Party daily, Rude Pravo, said Thursday the decision to
abandon the project ``is motivated not by ecological, but mainly
political reasons.''

<HEAD>Panel to Report Not Enough Scientific Evidence, Sources Say</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A panel of the National Academy of Sciences
has concluded there is insufficent scientific evidence to assure
that oil can be produced off the California and Florida coasts
without harming the environment, informed sources said Thursday.
   The report by a panel of the Academy's National Research Council
is to be presented Friday to a presidential task force reviewing
oil leasing in federal waters off the coasts of the two states.
   President Bush, who in his oil business days helped pioneer
offshore exploration, has held up a decison on whether to go ahead
with leasing pending a review of their potential environmental
impact.
   According to sources familiar with the panel's findings, the
panel has concluded that the existing data on the impact of oil
exploration in the three areas it studied _ northern California,
southern California and the souther Gulf Coast area of Florida _
are inadequate and not reliable enough to warrant a decision being
made on whether to award leases.
   The panel did not specifically recommend against oil or gas
exploration in the three areas, but said more scientific and
technical data should be gathered before a decision is made one way
or the other, said the sources, who spoke on condition that they
not be identified by name or affiliation.
   Environmentalists have long opposed oil driling in the three
areas _ 1.1 million acres of ocean off Southern California, another
6.7 million acres off Northern California, and 14 million acres in
the Gulf of Mexico near the Florida Everglades. Southern California
waters already are an important production area but oil has not
been found in the other two areas.
   According to the sources, who spoke on the condition that they
not be identified by name, the Academy's panel of scientific
experts examined available data on what impact exploration in the
three areas would have on the environment, marine geography and
nearby mainland economy.
   The findings are expected to be a major victory for
environmentalists and others who have opposed offshore oil
exploration in the three areas.
   ``If they're saying this it's a major swipe at those who are for
drilling,'' said Lisa Speer, a staff lawyer for the Natural
Resources Defense Council who has opposed offshore drilling.
   When Bush announced his drillijng delay in February, he also
asked the academy to examine available information on environment
impacts of drilling as well as data on the potential for a major
petroleum discovery.
   The task force, headed by Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan, is to
make a recommendation to the president by the end of the year.

<HEAD>Snow Closes Schools in Parts of Michigan, Wisconsin</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Heavy snow shut down schools and businesses in parts of Michigan
and northern Wisconsin on Thursday, while rain plagued the
Southeast.
   Michigan's western Upper Peninsula was covered in up to 36
inches of snow that had fallen since Tuesday. Snow-plowing crews
were forced off the streets Thursday by too much snow and ice.
   The snow snarled traffic, but no serious accidents or injuries
were reported.
   Scattered electrical outages were reported in Ironwood, Mich.
Four public school districts shut down, along with Gogebic County
buses and some businesses in Ironwood, sheriff's Deputy Jay Kangas
said.
   Far northern Wisconsin got two feet of snow since Wednesday.
   ``They (residents) don't like it, but they're used to it,'' said
Larry Baldovin, sheriff in Iron County, Wis.
   Geri Zaelski, a bookkeeper for Hurley, Wis., Public Schools,
struggled through hip-deep drifts to get to work even though
schools were closed.
   ``I live only two blocks from work and I had too much work to do
to miss a whole day,'' she said.
   The snow was attributed to low pressure over Lake Huron.
   Light snow was scattered across the upper Mississippi Valley,
eastern portions of the Dakotas and the Minneapolis area of
Minnesota.
   Rainshowers ahead of a cold front in the Southeast were
scattered from the central Gulf Coast to Georgia and South Carolina.
   Cloudy skies prevailed from the Mississippi Valley to the
Atlantic Coast and from the Dakotas to Washington, with sunny skies
across much of the rest of the nation.
   Temperatures dipped below freezing in the Great Plains region,
with single-digit readings as far south as southeast Colorado.
   Highs in Florida were in the 70s and 80s, with temperatuers in
the 60s in the Gulf Coast.
   A new record low for the date _ 22 degrees _ was set in Midland,
Texas. The old record, set in 1966, was 27 degrees.
   The morning cold spots in the Lower 48 states were Grand Forks,
N.D., and Yellowstone National Park, Wyo. Both had lows of 4
degrees.

   Bells, sirens and thousands of children's
voices rang out across two states Thursday as both Dakotas marked
their 100th birthdays. Each was admitted to the union on Nov. 2,
1889 _ though residents continue to argue good-naturedly about
which really was first.
   Pony Express riders carrying messages between the two states
``ran flat out'' trying to emulate the riding of their
predecessors, and the events of 1889 and other pioneer milestones
were re-enacted.
   North Dakota Gov. George Sinner kidded his South Dakota
counterpart, Gov. George Mickelson, after Mickelson arrived a few
minutes late for a morning radio show in which the governors wished
each other's states a Happy Birthday.
   ``I thought it was appropriate that you got in a minute or two
late,'' Sinner told Mickelson. ``We did some research, and it turns
out that North Dakota was actually the first of these states to
become states, and so that minute or two was just exactly right.''
   Officials said not even President Benjamin Harrison, who signed
the Nov. 2 proclamation that created both states, knew which one
came first even though North Dakota was admitted as the 39th state
and South Dakota as the 40th.
   ``President Harrison really did kind of a wonderful thing when
he shuffled those papers and didn't let anybody know who was
first,'' said Jim Sawyer, assistant director of the South Dakota
Centennial Commission.
   ``The president covered the papers up and then he said `They
were born together, they are one, and I shall make them twins.'
Then he shuffled them again and signed them. Even he doesn't know
which one came first.''
   North Dakota invited to the state capital more than 6,000
second-graders _ scheduled to graduate from high school in the year
2000 _ to join in song during festivities at the Bismarck Civic
Center.
   The pupils helped in the official countdown to 3:40 p.m._ the
exact moment when North Dakota became a state 100 years ago. Then
balloons fell from the ceiling and the arena erupted into a
boisterous round of ``Happy Birthday.''
   ``Just think if everybody would have brought a present,'' said
David Schaefer, from New Rockford, gazing at a wall festooned with
hundreds of birthday cards made by students around the state.
   An arch fashioned of red, white and blue balloons stretched over
the stage, which was flanked by the North Dakota state seal and
centennial logo.
   ``It is a sense that we are bringing back a little history,''
said one of the Pony Express riders, Ken Tischmak of Shields.
Tischmak's horse, Firewater, is a Spanish mustang, a descendant of
the breed used in the original Pony Express, he said.
   ``We went all out,'' he said. ``We tried to do it as close as we
could to the way they did it originally. And when they ran it
originally, they ran flat out.''
   Erma Bohrer of Napoleon arranged stacks of napkins as she
prepared to serve cake and cupcakes to celebrants. About 6,500
cupcakes were made, plus eight large cakes decorated with North
Dakota's centennial logo.
   ``I'm getting excited, getting ready for a rush,'' she said.
   In South Dakota, Watertown was declared ``Capital for a Day.''
It was the home of the state's first governor, Arthur C. Mellette.
   State officials were on hand for a re-enactment of Mellette's
swearing-in ceremony, abbreviated by subfreezing temperatures and a
stiff wind. The ceremony followed a parade from the restored
Mellette House.
   ``This is wonderful, terrific,'' said Mellette's
great-granddaughter, Mimi Ide Suverkrup, of Cedar Pines Park,
Calif. ``Although I never met him, Arthur was always sort of a
grand figure to me, somewhat of a reserved but benevolent person.''
   The weather was slightly chillier than in 1889, with light snow
and highs in the 20s over both states. Weather records show both
states had highs in the 40s and 50s on Nov. 2, 1889, said Bill
Abeling, meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Bismarck.

   Anti-drug abuse ads are making a big impact in
areas where they are seen frequently, according to a survey
released Thursday by a non-profit coalition of advertisers that
sponsors many of the ads.
   The results prompted President Bush to praise media leaders who
have donated time and space for the commercials.
   ``This group is at the leading edge of a powerful and moving
effort debunking the big myth about drugs by deglamorizing them and
deglamorizing their users,'' Bush told a White House gathering of
more than 100 media executives.
   The survey by Gordon S. Black Corp. _ which was hired to conduct
the poll by the Media-Advertising Partnership for a Drug-Free
America which produce and promote the ads _ found that marijuana
use among adults in areas where the ads were shown frequently
declined 33 percent in one year.
   In areas where the ads were seen and heard more rarely, the use
dropped only 15 percent, the survey found.
   As for adult cocaine use, it declined 15 percent in
high-frequency areas compared with 2 percent in low-frequency areas.
   Black, who announced the findings to the media leaders, said the
margin of error for various parts of the survey of about 7,000
people ranged from one-half percent to 4 percent.
   Black said one of the survey's discouraging findings was that
one of every six children aged 9 to 12 is approached to buy or use
drugs, whether they live in the cities, the suburbs or rural areas.
   However, the survey indicated that the percentage of such young
people who said they had been offered drugs declined from 18
percent in 1988 to 16 percent in 1989, the same level as 1987.
   The survey also found that the percentage of children 9-12 who
had tried marijuana rose from 4 percent in 1988 to 6 percent in
1989, while the percentage of those who had tried cocaine or its
smokeable form, crack, remained at 1 percent each for both years.
   In addition, Black said, attitudes among teen-agers toward drug
abuse showed ``only marginal improvement.'' Such attitudes improved
among 13 year olds, but not among those 16 to 17, the survey found.
   The partnership aims to air $365 million worth of anti-drug ads
a year _ which calculates both the costs of the ads and the donated
media time _ for a total of $1 million a day, announced partnership
Chairman James E. Burke, the former chairman and chief executive
officer of Johnson &amp; Johnson Co.
   ``What we're trying to accomplish is $1 billion over the next
three years,'' said partnership spokeswoman Theresa Venet Grant.
``That number provides about one anti-drug message a day for every
American. Each person will see or hear in one medium or another one
anti-drug message a day.''
   Some critics have questioned the impact of anti-drug ads.
   Peggy Charren, president of Action for Children's Television,
said in an interview Thursday that although she was heartened by
some of the survey's findings, she was wary of them because the
poll was financed by the group putting out the ads.
   ``I hope this is right,'' she said of the survey results. ``I
would be surer that it was right if the people doing the research
had nothing to do with the people doing the advertising.
   Charren contends that the ads generally are ``conscience money
for a society that is not taking care of that part of the
population that's most likely to get involved in drugs.''
   ``This isn't all bad, but I would worry about thinking this was
the solution to the drug problem,'' she said.
   John Condry, a Cornell University professor who has studied the
ratio of pro-drug to anti-drug messages on television says the
ratio is 8-to-1 in favor of pro-drug messages, including programs
and advertisements showing people smoking, drinking or taking
over-the-counter medicines.
   ``What they are saying is if you don't like the state you're in,
if you have a headache, you take a drug ... take some sort of
substance to change how you feel,'' Condry said. ``For a child,
it's not clear there's a distinction between one drug and another _
a pill's a pill.''
   Burke, whose former company makes numerous medications including
Tylenol pain medicine, said, ``I don't think there's any evidence
to support that.''
   Yet, he added, ``I have to agree that we are a society that
somehow got ourselves into the fix of believing that if we're in
pain, or have a problem, take a pill. And I would have to say that
on an overall basis, that can contribute to the problem. What that
suggests is those of us like Johnson &amp; Johnson who are advertising
medicines have to be aware of that concern, and I think our people
are.''
   Meanwhile, the partnership has begun a $90 million public
service advertising campaign aimed specifically at black youths and
their parents.
   The 11 television ads _ two of which are still in production _
plus 14 radio and two billboard ads were ``created by black-owned
agencies that specialize in African-American markets,'' Grant said.
   One called ``Funeral Home'' depicts a black mother packing a
suitcase of clothes in which her son, whom she knew was a drug
user, is to be buried. Another ad called ``New Slavery'' likens
drug addiction to slavery, and a third called ``Pusher's Plea''
depicts a black teen-ager thanking an unseen black parent for
letting him ``get first crack'' at her children, Grant said.

   Sandinista troops launched attacks in
Nicaragua's central and northern mountains Thursday to try to wipe
out outnumbered Contra forces that have infiltrated from Honduras,
according to reports.
   Lt. Col. Rosa Pasos, a military spokeswoman, said most of the
action was concentrated on rebels sneaking into Nicaragua, but she
would confirm only one attack near Quilali, in the border province
of Nueva Segovia.
   President Daniel Ortega ended a 19-month cease-fire on
Wednesday, saying the Contras had been stepping up attacks inside
Nicaragua. He also blamed the United States for the renewed attacks
and accused President Bush of promoting ``terrorism.''
   Bush on Thursday appeared to reopen the possibility he may seek
a renewal of U.S. military aid for the Contras, saying ``we will
leave our options open'' now that the Sandinistas resumed military
attacks.
   The Contras announced Thursday they had accepted in principle a
Sandinista offer to meet Monday and Tuesday at the United Nations
to discuss demobilization. Roman Catholic Cardinal Miguel Obando y
Bravo said he had also accepted an invitation.
   In a communique, the Contras said they were still awaiting an
official invitation from a U.N.-Organization of American States
commission set up to verify Central American peace accords.
   The Sandinista party newspaper Barricada said Thursday that
combat units in 14 towns in northern Nicaragua began operations
overnight, but neither the newspaper nor Ms. Pasos gave details.
   The Contra communique, distributed by the Nicaraguan Resistance
in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, said the Sandinistas mounted attacks
Wednesday with tanks, helicopter gunships and heavy artillery.
   Ms. Pasos refused to comment and said she had no immediate
reports on casualties or details of the fighting.
   In Tegucigalpa, Contra commander Enrique Bermudez said the
Contras would continue observing the cease-fire because they have
not had the resources to launch attacks since U.S. non-lethal aid
was cut off in February 1988.
   ``These troops will only carry out evasive actions,'' said
Bermudez.
   Contra field commanders began moving their troops back into
Nicaragua from Honduras after Central American peace accords were
signed Aug. 7, but said they would await the outcome of national
elections set for Feb. 25 before deciding whether to launch
offensive operations.
   The accords called for voluntary Contra demobilization in
exchange for democratic reforms in Nicaragua, but the Contras were
not a party to the agreement and said they would not disband.
   In Washington, the House of Representatives voted 379-29 for a
non-binding resolution denouncing Ortega's resumption of military
action against the rebels.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Thursday it was
unrealistic to expect the Contras to lay down their arms when the
leftist Sandinista government is out ``to destroy them.''
   State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said the
administration believes the Contra reports that the Sandinistas
have commenced major military operations in at least two regions in
Nicaragua.
   Honduran President Jose Azcona Hoyo urged Ortega to reconsider
his decision on the cease-fire. ``Ortega's decision is deplorable.
Nevertheless, I hope he meditates ... and rectifies it,'' he said
in Tegucigalpa.
   The Hondurans also accused the Sandinistas of attacking a
Honduran army post Monday in the border town of Las Manos. Col.
Manuel Suarez Benavides said there were no casualties.
   A duty officer at the Nicaraguan Defense Ministry said he wasn't
familiar with the alleged incident and could not comment
immediately.
   Ms. Pasos said most of the operations, which started near the
Honduran border, were in north and south-central Nicaragua.
   Ms. Pasos put the number of Contra fighters inside Nicaragua at
2,500; U.S. estimates put it at 4,000 and Bermudez said there were
more than 6,000. They face the 70,000-member Sandinista armed
forces.
   Ms. Pasos accused the Contras of using the cease-fire to bolster
their positions and prepare for further attacks inside his country.
   U.S. officials earlier ruled out immediate resumption of
military aid to the Contras and the Bush administration said it was
consulting with Central American leaders to bring diplomatic
pressure on Ortega.
   Nicaraguan government and Contra representatives signed a
temporary truce in March 1988, but when peace talks broke down
three months later, the Sandinistas continued extending the
cease-fire every month.
   In a report Thursday, Americas Watch, a private human rights
group based in New York, held the Sandinistas responsible for the
deaths of 74 Contra supporters in northern Nicaragua from 1987 to
early 1989 and for the disappearance of 14 others thought to
support the rebels.
   But in a separate report it called ``patently false'' a claim by
State Department and Nicaraguan opposition groups that 5,000 to
7,000 Nicaraguans are being detained for political offenses. It
said the 1,306 estimated by the International Committee for the Red
Cross last August was nearer the mark.

<HEAD>GE Official Acknowledges Inadequate Records On Fan Serial Numbers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SEERY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SIOUX CITY, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A General Electric official acknowledged
Thursday that no records exist to prove a serial number mixup
wasn't responsible for a faulty engine part placed in the United
Airlines DC-10 that crashed July 19.
   But James Tucker, general manager of the GE airplane engine
plant in Evendale, Ohio, testified before federal safety
investigators that company officials are certain that two fan disks
numbered 00385 were not mixed up.
   One of the disks was intended for the scrap heap, while the
other was approved for installation in a DC-10.
   A fan disk with that serial number broke apart in flight and is
being blamed for the crash of United Flight 232 as it made an
emergency landing at Sioux City's airport. The crash killed 112
people.
   The fan disk was made in 1971. A National Transportation Safety
Board report found a tiny crack that experts say probably existed
before the crash. When GE pulled manufacturing records on the disk
after the crash, it discovered that two disks had mistakenly been
given the same serial number in 1971.
   One of those disks was deemed faulty after testing that year and
was slated to be scrapped. The other disk was sent on through the
manufacturing process.
   Tucker said the two disks would have been stored in different
areas of the Ohio plant and were tested three months apart. Records
show the part that failed GE's testing was sent to another company
for further testing and the flaw was confirmed, Tucker said.
   But he acknowledged that no records exist to prove the company's
claim that the two disks with the same serial number were not
confused. Tucker said he too believes the two disks were not mixed
up.
   ``I made an analogy of a person being hit over the head and his
wallet being stolen,'' Tucker testified Thursday at the NTSB
hearing into the crash.
   ``And so somebody comes up to him and said, `Show me what your
name is and give us proof of who you are.' He can't do it. But then
they take him down to fingerprint him and then they find out who he
is.''
   Tucker said the second test that found a flaw in the same spot
as the earlier test on the faulty disk ``is the fingerprint of that
particular disk.''
   D.B. Robinson, an accident investigator for the Air Line Pilots
Association, said Thursday during a break on the hearing's fourth
day that questions about any serial mixup remain without adequate
proof.
   ``I don't think the records exist properly to answer that
question right now,'' he said.
   ``I'm not satisfied, but I'm not dissatisfied, either,''
Robinson said. ``The (safety) board will discover what's going on.
It will be resolved.''

   Mayor W. Wilson Goode entered a hospital
Thursday for the second time in two weeks after experiencing an
irregular heartbeat.
   Doctors said the mayor's condition was not life threatening and
he felt fine. The 51-year-old mayor will remain hospitalized until
Saturday for tests.
   ``We believe it is an innocent type of heart irregularity which
can be seen in individuals with normal hearts,'' said his
cardiologist, Dr. Edward S. Cooper.
   From early Wednesday to early Thursday, Goode experienced three
bouts of rapid heartbeats lasting from 30 seconds to several
minutes, doctors said.
   The latest occcured at 5 a.m. Thursday while the mayor was being
monitored in the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania.
   ``I have no idea yet what is triggering these rapid but normal
heartbeats. Whether it is overwork or something, I can't say right
now,'' Cooper said.
   Goode first went to the hospital Oct. 20 after complaining of
head and neck pain. After tests, another physician said Goode had a
normal heart and attributed his symptoms to sinus problems.
   Cooper said more tests will be taken before Goode is discharged.
   ``If we come up with nothing, we have to assume it has something
to do with his 16-hour work days, and maybe he should slow down,''
Cooper said.

   George Burns at 93 says he knows he's old enough
for his body to quit on him but he has so many projects in the
works that he ``can't afford to die.''
   One of them is a two-week appearance at the London Palladium in
January 1996, when the comedian will celebrate his 100th birthday.
   ``You can't do anything about dying,'' he told USA Weekend in
its Nov. 3-5 issue. ``I don't think I'm going to die for a long
time because I'm busy.''
   These days he's pushing his newly released show-biz memoir,
``All My Best Friends;'' a new comedy video, ``George Burns: His
Wit and Wisdom;'' and hopes to begin filming ``Oh, God! Book IV''
as soon as he finds a script he likes.
   ``I think the most important thing is to fall in love with what
you do for a living. It's nice to get out of bed and do something
that day that you're going to love,'' he said.
   His day-to-day chores are made more difficult by arthritis,
astigmatism and hearing loss and he had a bypass operation at age
79, but Burns says he is looking toward the future.
   ``I'm not interested in things I've done. I'm interested in what
I'm doing right now and what I'm doing tomorrow,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Soldiers took control of highways leading into
the capital and armored units patrolled the city Thursday, the day
after a bold attack by leftist guerrillas on police guarding a
religious procession.
   Police arrested 13 employees of the newspaper El Diario,
considered the public voice of the Maoist Shining Path rebels,
officials said.
   Officials said two guerrillas were killed and at least 15 people
wounded in the battle at an All Saints' Day observance in a
working-class district.
   El Peruano, the government newspaper, said the decree placing
Lima and its port of Callao under military control was a response
to the call by the Shining Path for a general strike in Lima Friday.
   Shining Path has designated it an ``armed strike,'' implying
violence against anyone who does not cooperate.
   Major political parties and candidates for municipal office in
Lima scheduled a ``March for Peace'' on Friday to counter the
strike. Candidates for the April presidential election said they
would join the march.
   The guerrillas are trying to disrupt nationwide municipal
elections set for Nov. 12. Shining Path has killed at least 120
mayors, candidates and local officials this year, which caused
hundreds more to quit in fear.
   In Washington, the State Department on Thursday advised U.S.
citizens against traveling to Peru until after the elections.
   Lima and Callao have been under a state of emergency that
suspends civil rights and gives authorities broad powers in
fighting the insurgents, but national police had been in charge
until Thursday.
   Other areas affected by the emergency _ about one-third of the
country and half the 21 million people _ have been under military
jurisdiction.
   Government spokesman Mario Betayeluz said the condition was
short of martial law despite the military involvement.
   Radio reports Thursday said the military was exerting strict
control along the main routes into Lima: the coastal Pan-American
Highway, which runs through the city, and the Central Highway
leading east to the Andes.
   Other reports said guerrillas were stopping buses on rural
highways and confiscating electoral identification cards from the
passengers.
   El Diario is widely known as a voice of the Shining Path, and
has been used by the group to claim responsibility for attacks and
to urge people to support the group's calls for strikes.
   El Diario's director Janet Talavera was arrested earlier this
year and is still in detention on charges of supporting terrorism,
while editor Luis Arce Borja is in self-imposed exile in Europe.
   Official reports and witnesses to Wednesday's battle said 100 to
150 Shining Path guerrillas and supporters began marching in the
working class district of La Victoria. The area was filled with
people for a religious procession on All Saints' Day.
   Interior Minister Agustin Mantilla said two rebels were killed
and 15 people wounded. He said about 150 people were arrested.
   President Alan Garcia said on TV Thursday night at least some of
the wounded and 100 or more of those arrested were known to have
connections with Shining Path, which began its insurgency in 1980
near the Andean city of Ayacucho, 235 miles southeast of Lima.
   The government says more than 15,000 people have been killed in
the insurgency.

<HEAD>Late Entrant in Presidential Race Holds Surprise Lead in Poll</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEN SILVERSTEIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A TV entertainer and millionaire
businessman who declared his candidacy for president just two days
ago holds a wide lead among voters questioned about the race,
according to a poll released Thursday.
   Last-minute entrant Silvio Santos, a conservative running on the
ticket of the small Brazilian Municipalist Party, was the choice of
29 percent of the voters queried by the Gallup Institute.
   The poll, published in the newspaper O Estado de Sao Paulo,
comes less than two weeks before the scheduled Nov. 15 election.
Santos, a former street vendor who has strong support among the
poor, declared his candidacy Tuesday but still faces legal
challenges.
   The newspaper said the support for center-right candidate
Fernando Collor de Mello, who had led the polls for six months,
plunged from 29.3 percent to 18.6 percent among those questioned.
   The nationwide poll was conducted between Oct. 26 and Wednesday,
with people interviewed at random in the street and their homes.
The margin of error was 3 percent.
   Santos' candidacy still faces legal challenges before it can be
registered with the Supreme Electoral Court.
   Accusations have been made that Santos, a TV entertainer who
owns more than 30 businesses, paid off former Municipalist Party
candidate Armando Correa to resign.
   The court must also decide if Santos violated a law that
requires corporate directors to step down from their positions
three months before declaring their candidacy.
   Santos, who runs the SBT television network, the nation's second
largest, says he is a shareholder and not a director in the
company, and thus exempt from the law.
   A ruling on Santos' bid may not come until Nov. 13, two days
before the vote.
   Collor de Mello, whose base of support is with the rural poor,
was hardest hit by Santos' candidacy but other major candidates saw
their support fall as well, according to the poll.
   Rep. Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, of the socialist Workers' Party
came in third with the support of 10.6 percent of those questioned,
down from 12.4 percent in the last poll.
   Left-wing populist Leonel Brizola, a former governor, was
fourth, receiving 9.9 percent, a drop of 2.8 percent.
   Mario Covas, of the Brazilian Social Democratic Party, was fifth
with 8 percent support, down slightly from 8.2 percent in last
week's poll.
   Eight percent of those questioned were unsure who they would
vote for, and 5.6 percent said they would cast blank ballots.
   Gallup conducted a simultaneous poll that excluded Santos from
the presidential contenders.
   Without Santos in the race, 27.5 percent of those questioned
favored Collor de Mello, followed by da Silva at 13.8 percent,
Brizola with 12.7 percent and Covas at 10.6 percent.
   On Nov. 15, 82 million Brazilians are to choose a successor to
President Jose Sarney for a five-year term, the first popular vote
for president since 1960. Sarney was selected by an Electoral
College influenced by the military regime that ruled the country
from 1964 to 1985.
   If no candidate wins a majority Nov. 15, the two top
vote-getters will face each other in a runoff in December.
   Santos' entrance into the race was criticized by left- and
right-wing candidates, who agreed Sarney was behind the maneuver.
The president has been harshly attacked by the campaign's leading
contenders, who blame him for 1,300 percent inflation and
corruption.
   Sarney by law cannot run for re-election.

<HEAD>New Species Of Dinosaur Believed Found in Australian Outback</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists said Thursday they believe a
previously unknown species of dinosaur has been found in the
Australian Outback by a rancher who stumbled on a
100-million-year-old skeleton while herding cattle.
   Queensland Museum officials said the son of a property owner
discovered the fossilized skull of a 16-foot pliosaur, or
short-necked reptile, sticking out of a creekbed after heavy rains
three weeks ago.
   Mary Wade, the museum's curator of palaentology, called the find
significant and said it was one of the best preserved ever found
here.
   ``It has been preserved even down to the tiny bones in its
flipper,'' she said. ``It is not recognizable as anything we have
seen in Australia to date. We are checking the literature but we
think it might be a new species.''
   She said the complete skeleton was removed from a property near
Richmond in northwest Queensland, Australia's northern subtropical
state, and that the family did not want publicity.
   The creature was a carnivore that lived in the inland sea that
covered most of western Queensland about 100 million years ago.
Along with the remains were those of prehistoric fish and turtles
believed to have been the animal's prey.
   To remove the fossils, the team removed soil and rock from
around them before wrapping them in plaster bandages. The fossils
were then removed in blocks to ensure they were kept in order.
   The museum said the find eventually would be displayed.

   The Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday
approved a bill providing a temporary stay of deportations of
Salvadorans and Nicaraguans in this country illegally after fleeing
conflict in their home countries.
   The measure won committee approval, 11-3, and now goes to the
Senate floor.
   The House last week approved a similar bill that also would
provide a three-year stay of deportations of Chinese in the United
States after fleeing the crackdown this summer against student
democracy demonstrations.
   That measure was sent to a subcommittee for further study.
   The bill approved by the full panel contains no provision for
staying deportations of Chinese.
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., sponsor of the bill, said it was
needed to provide safe haven for citizens of the two Central
American nations who have not gained refugee status and to enable
them to work in this country.
   Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., who had been fighting the measure for
more than two months, relented on Thursday but said he remained an
opponent.
   He said the murder rate in El Salvador was lower than in the
District of Columbia and added that the real aim was to enable the
aliens to get jobs. He said this would undermine the nation's
existing immigration laws.

   State lawmakers convened a special
session Thursday to discuss ways to pay for earthquake relief,
including boosting the state's sales tax in time for Christmas
shopping.
   Marilyn Quayle, meanwhile, toured ravaged Watsonville, one of
the farm communities south of San Franciso that were among the
hardest hit by the Oct. 17 quake. The wife of Vice President Dan
Quayle has made disaster relief her personal cause.
   ``I'm glad I came here and will certainly go back to Washington
and tell the president of the problems here now and the hardships
that will be faced in the months to come,'' she said.
   ``Sometimes it's a lot harder for the smaller towns,'' Mrs.
Quayle told Mayor Betty Murphy as they walked past cracked and
crumbling buildings that once formed the economic heart of the city
of 28,000 residents.
   Her visit comes a day after the San Francisco Bay area was
rattled by yet another strong aftershock, this one measuring 4.4 on
the Richter scale. No serious damage or injuries were reported.
   Damages from the earthquake have been estimated at more than
$7.1 billion. Gov. George Deukmejian wants to raise $800 million
for the state's share of earthquake relief by raising the sales tax
charged statewide by a quarter-percent, from 6 percent to 6.25
percent.
   ``Our state has pulled together like a family during this period
of pain and suffering, and I am personally very proud of the way
our state has risen to the challenge,'' Deukmejian said in a
written message to the Legislature.
   Lawmakers convened about midday to weigh dozens of other
measures aimed at helping the quake victims. The session is
expected to last two or three days.
   Deukmejian and the Legislature's top four leaders agreed earlier
this week to propose a 13-month sales tax increase. They want the
tax to begin Dec. 1 and end Dec. 31, 1990 _ to take in two holiday
shopping periods.
   Any increase must be approved by two-thirds of each legislative
house. While the state sales tax is 6 percent, the total sales tax
charged in some counties is higher because of locally levied sales
taxes.
   ``We have learned a lot and we suffered a very severe blow on
Oct. 17. We need ... to make ourselves whole again,'' said Sen.
Leroy Greene as the special session opened.
   Mrs. Quayle's first stop was in Hollister, a farming town of
about 20,000 that suffered an estimated $100 million in quake
damage, said David Edge, chief administrative officer for tiny San
Benito County.
   ``We understand that she works very hard in disaster relief
programs and that this isn't just a publicity stunt to make the
Bush administration look good,'' Edge said.
   On Friday morning, Mrs. Quayle plans to visit the seaside resort
of Santa Cruz and the inland city of Los Gatos before heading for
San Francisco for an afternoon meeting.
   Wednesday's aftershock, which struck at 9:50 p.m., was centered
slightly north of the epicenter of last month's 7.1-magnitude
earthquake, said Pat Jorgenson, spokeswoman for the U.S. Geological
Survey in Menlo Park.
   San Francisco police reported very minor damage in the city's
Marina district, which was badly damaged in the big earthquake.
   In another developent, U.S. Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., said
federal officials have reversed an earlier decision and approved
the use of 100 federally owned mobile homes for people displaced by
the earthquake in Santa Cruz County.
   Panetta said Federal Emergency Management Agency administrators
overruled a decision by Bay area FEMA officials that the homes were
not needed.

   A 14-year-old Indiana boy who saved his best
friend from an attacking Rottweiler dog was among 18 people
recognized Thursday by the Carnegie Hero Fund Commission.
   ``Everyone's saying, `You're a hero.' So I guess I am,'' Ryan
Eberhard said in a telephone interview from school in Fort Wayne,
Ind. ``But I'm trying to think I'm not. I just did it because my
friend was in danger, not because I wanted to be a hero.''
   The eighth-grader is among 7,385 Americans and Canadians honored
by the commission since its founding by Pittsburgh industrialist
Andrew Carnegie in 1904. More than $18.1 million has been awarded
in one-time payments and pensions to the heroes or their survivors.
   In a rare move, the commission designated $50,000 in grants to
relief agencies in the earthquake-ravaged San Francisco Bay area
and South Carolina, which bore the brunt of Hurricane Hugo.
   Ryan, the youngest hero recognized Thursday, was at home Jan. 28
when he heard screaming across the street. The dog had broken its
chain and was attacking Anthony J. Quinn, 13.
   Ryan ran over and yelled at the dog, which turned on him.
   ``It started biting me. I didn't even really know I'd got bitten
until later,'' Ryan recalled.
   Anthony managed to crawl inside his family's home, and Ryan ran
to his own house with the 94-pound dog hanging from his arm.
   ``I swung it around, and it fell on its back and gave me a
chance to get in the house,'' said Ryan, a tackle for his football
team who weighs 160 pounds and is about 5-foot-10.
   Anthony was hospitalized for two days and required surgery for
bites to his arm, shoulder, back and thigh. Ryan was treated for
bites to his right arm and chest. The dog was destroyed.
   ``In the hospital, he said, `Thank you, Ryan. You saved my
life.' That means a lot,'' Ryan said. ``His mom said if I ever have
any problems or anything, he'll help you out. So it really makes me
feel great.''
   Also recognized Thursday were 14 other Americans and three
Canadians:
   _Lynn Lee Lewis Porter, 27, of Clinton, Miss., jumped into a
moving car whose driver had suffered a heart attack in Jackson,
Miss., on Feb. 14. The man recovered.
   _Anthony G. Falzo, 35, a road freight conductor from Bloomfield,
N.J., jumped off his moving train to pull two toddlers off railroad
tracks in Ramsey, N.J., on May 1.
   _Kenneth R. Falls, 31, of Kings Mountain, N.C., saved a man from
his burning home in Bessemer City, N.C., on Sept. 5, 1988.
   _Robert L. Tighe, 31, a bus driver from Shreveport, La., rescued
a man from his burning car in Tyler, Texas, on Jan. 24.
   _Joel L. Warren, 24, of Ridgecrest, Calif., saved a 70-year-old
neighbor from the man's burning mobile home on Nov. 17, 1988.

<HEAD>Top-Level Australia-U.S. Talks Begin in Sydney</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III
met Friday with Foreign Minister Gareth Evans for talks centering
on the Australian-U.S. dispute over agricultural subsidies.
   Evans, who said trade has ``always been an element in our
relationship,'' labeled the U.S. Farm Bill, the American Export
Enhancement Program and sugar protection measures as issues
dividing the two countries.
   Baker however said the two countries share similar perspectives
on most issues to a ``remarkable degree,'' adding, ``Whenever we do
not see eye-to-eye, we can rely on our tradition of close
consultations.''
   In addition to trade, the two days of talks that end Saturday
are expected to include East-West relations, chemical weapons and
reforms in Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and China.
   Baker praised Australia's role as an ally in the two world wars
and the Korean conflict, adding that both countries are ``boosters
of an open international trading system.''
   ``We can take pride in the work our nations have done to promote
a more open, market-oriented international trading system,'' he
said. ``We applaud the highly constructive role Australia has
played in our mutual efforts to strengthen the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (GATT) rules governing agricultural trade,''
   Evans replied: ``But what gives us heart is the evident
willingness of the U.S. to work to get genuine and lasting
improvements in international trading arrangements.''
   Vice President Dan Quayle was criticized on a visit this summer
for saying he didn't believe Australian concerns about subsidies
for U.S. farm exports, prompting Trade Minister Michael Duffy to
say Quayle didn't know what he was talking about.
   Baker arrived Thursday night with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
for the talks that replace those held annually when New Zealand was
a functioning partner of the ANZUS treaty.
   New Zealand's 1984 anti-nuclear policy, which banned port visits
by U.S. nuclear-powered warships, led to a major rift with the U.S.
   Baker said in Washington before leaving he would not meet with
any New Zealand officials.
   But in the first sign of cooperation since the two countries
drifted apart, the U.S. government Friday announced support for a
resolution in the United Nations against driftnet fishing that was
co-sponsored by New Zealand.
   The New Zealand Prime Minister, Geoffrey Palmer, said in
Wellington that his labor government had been working closely with
the U.S. on the resolution since a visit in September.
   ``I am delighted with the outcome,'' Palmer said.
   Baker and Cheney head the highest-level U.S. delegation to
Australia in more than 20 years. Commerce Secretary Robert A.
Mosbacher and Trade Representative Carla Hills also are visiting
for a 12-nation economic conference of Pacific Rim countries
starting Monday.
   Baker and Evans emphasized in their statements the close
relationship between Canberra and Washington.
   ``I cannot overstate the value the United States attaches to
continued excellent relations with Australia,'' said Baker, adding
that this was his first visit and, ``I do not plan to be a stranger
Down Under.''
   The talks at Watson Naval Base conclude Saturday.

   A wooden skeleton decked out in a red bandana
and sitting before a lighted incense burner stopped passers-by in
the central plaza Thursday.
   The hand-carved figure, surrounded by rows of giant marigolds,
was part of an altar set up in a traditional celebration of the Day
of the Dead.
   Mexican families and organizations prepare similar altars in
their homes, in cemeteries, in restaurants and museums, every Nov.
1 and 2. The altars are to honor the deceased, whose souls are said
to return to visit and to take sustenance from offerings of food
and drink.
   The altar in the central plaza, sponsored by the Indian Peoples'
National Coordinator, had another purpose as well.
   ``This is a way of remembering all the loved ones who have
struggled for the defense of the Nahuatl Indians,'' said a young
man in ceremonial dress, who introduced himself as Temilotzin, or
``Rock that Rolls.''
   Written on sheets of poster board placed on the blocklong
sidewalk altar were the names Cuauhtemoc, the last Indian ruler of
Mexico before the Spanish Conquest in 1521, and other leaders of
Nahuatl extraction.
   Day of the Dead ceremonies have been held in the belief that
death is part of eternal transformation, participants said. As
cultures and religions have mingled in Mexico, annual offerings
have changed.
   Nov. 1, the Roman Catholic All Saint's Day, is dedicated to
deceased children, and Nov. 2, All Soul's Day, to adults.
   Offerings honored heroes of Mexico's 1810 independence from
Spain, the 1910-21 Mexican Revolution, victims of a 1968 army
massacre of student protesters in Mexico City and those killed in
the June crackdown of the pro-democracy movement in China and in
Mexico City's September 1985 earthquakes.
   In statement critical of Mexican government policy, the national
organization included among the dead to be remembered
``independence,'' ``democracy,'' ``collective bargaining
contracts,'' and ``popular sovereignty.''
   ``What we want to do is create a universalist consciousness and
get the government to take notice,'' said Temilotzin, who spoke in
both Nahuatl and Spanish.
   Forty-five people held an all-night vigil at the altar to gain
strength ``from communion between ourselves and our ancestors,''
said Maria Anzures Malintzin, a Yaqui Indian religious leader.

   The Smothers Brothers comedy duo _ Tom and

concrete on the celebrated Hollywood Walk of Fame.
   More than 300 family, friends and fans cheered the famous

walkway, during ceremonies on Hollywood Boulevard.
   The star was placed in front of the Hollywood Deli, which has
dedicated a sandwich in their honor called ``The Smothers Brothers
Better Half Sandwich.''
   Half the sandwich features ``half of Tommy's favorite:
Pas'Trommy dip grilled on sourdough served with au jus gravy, and
half of Dick's favorite: A healthful combination of fresh sliced
turkey on whole wheat.''
   The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce recently voted to honor the

sidewalk star at a cost of $3,500.

<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Objections by Finnish security police
scuttled a draft agreement between Finland and the Soviet Union to
waive visa requirements, newspapers reported Thursday.
   The agreement was to have been signed here last week during
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's state visit.
   A report originating in the Uusi Suomi daily said negotiations
broke down due to opposition from Finnish police, who feared
security problems from an upsurge of Soviet vistors and potential
defectors.
   Instead, the two countries last week signed a ``memorandum of
intent'' to ease visa bureaucracy, together with 30 other joint
agreements, it added.
   The Finnish consulate in the Estonian capital of Tallinn granted
more than 32,000 visas by Oct. 31, more than 10 times the 3,000
granted in 1988.
   Police declined to comment on the report.
   Foreign Ministry official Marita Eerikainen said only that the
question could still be reviewed.
   ``The Soviet Union has not waived visa requirements with any
Western country, but as perestroika continues there seems to be a
real desire (in the Soviet Union) for a change in this policy,''
Eerikainen said.
   Eerikainen said a system of multiple entry visas already was in
use for some categories of visitors, such as business people and
students.

<HEAD>Family Says Battleship Victim Told of Earlier Turret Problems</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A sailor killed in the gun turret
explosion aboard the battleship USS Iowa had told his family of
previous firing problems and said ``goof-offs'' were ``going to get
us killed,'' a newspaper reported Thursday.
   Members of Jack E. Thompson Jr.'s family said the gunner's mate
told them of a February incident in which the No. 2 turret _ where
the fatal explosion occurred last April _ was ordered to fire with
its right 16-inch gun too close to a forward turret, the Daily
Press of Newport News reported.
   The blast blew off the rubber protective bellows of the forward
turret's guns.
   According to an aunt, Mary T. Wahler, Thompson also told
relatives of an earlier accidental firing and a fire inside the
turret.
   The Daily Press reported that Thompson, 22, of Greeneville,
Tenn., complained to his wife, Leasa, that ``there were a bunch of
goof-offs in the turret.''
   ``He said they were `going to get us killed someday,''' Mrs.
Thompson said.
   Rear Adm. Brent Baker, the Navy's chief of information at the
Pentagon, said, ``There was no accident back in February. It's not
true.''
   But two sailors confirmed to the newspaper that the incident
happened. One, former gunner's mate Roy Frazier, was assigned to
the No. 1 turret at the time the incident was said to have
occurred. The other sailor was not identified by the newspaper.
   None of the incidents were mentioned in the Navy's investigation
of the explosion. That report found the explosion ``most likely''
was caused by sabotage by a disgruntled gunner's mate, Clayton
Hartwig, who died in the blast.
   In Thompson's last letter to his wife, written eight days before
the explosion, he expressed uneasiness about the upcoming gunnery
exercise.
   ``We've got a dangerous shoot coming up. It's always scary,'' he
wrote.
   Mrs. Thompson said her husband never explained why the exercise
was any more dangerous than others.

<TEXT>
   A new book alleges that Sen. Edward M. Kennedy
was involved in a another auto accident just prior to the 1969
incident on a bridge at Chappaquiddick, but a Kennedy spokesman
Thursday labeled the charge ``preposterous.''
   In a book released Thursday to Washington media, author Kenneth
Kappel said previously overlooked evidence indicates that Kennedy
may have pushed his black Oldsmobile off the Dyke Bridge on
Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts to cover up an earlier accident
and to conceal his own drunken state.
   Kennedy spokesman Paul Donovan said, ``The story is preposterous
and absurd. We're not going to comment any further.''
   Kappel said dents in the roof and side of the car shown in
photographs could not have been caused by the vehicle's impact with
the water.
   The accident that claimed Mary Jo Kophechne's life occurred the
night of July 18, 1969. Kennedy has maintained he had made a wrong
turn in Chappaquiddick and drove off the narrow, wooden bridge over
a salt water pond.
   Kennedy said he made several attempts to try to rescue Kopechne
and then enlisted the help of two aides. He said at the time that
the 10-hour delay in reporting the accident resulted from his
confused and distraught state.
   The title of the book is ``Chappaquiddick Revealed: What Really
Happened.''

   Guerrillas of the Mozambique National
Resistance killed 22 civilians in a raid on a village along the
southern coast, including 15 women and a child, the national news
agency AIM reported Thursday.
   AIM, citing a report on Radio Mozambique, said the rebels
kidnapped the victims in Incadine village, then marched them to
Chonguene, 90 miles north of Maputo.
   A survivor, Lucia Malate, said the rebels vowed ``to kill us all
because we deny them power.''
   The rebels have been fighting since 1977 to undermine
Mozambique's leftist government.
   No government acknowledges supporting the guerrillas, who have
been accused of widespread atrocities against civilians.
   The hit-and-run attacks have devastated the economy and made
Mozambique one of the poorest countries in the world. Almost half
of the country's estimated 15 million people need food assistance.

   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa on Thursday
thanked the United States for its first emergency shipment of
grain, although he said he'd rather be accepting combines than corn.
   ``I am not delighted with this kind of help,'' said Walesa. ``I
treat this help as a kind of necessity, so we can work out
solutions.''
   The emergency food arriving from the United States and the
European Community is intended to help Poland weather shortages and
other ill effects of economic reform without an explosion of public
unrest that could threaten the Solidarity-led government of Prime
Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki.
   About 11,500 tons of U.S.-donated sorghum arrived by ship Monday
at the Baltic port of Gydnia, about 10 miles from Gdansk, the
headquarters of the Solidarity movement.
   The grain was unloaded Thursday, after U.S. and Solidarity
officials met on the ship's deck. U.S. Ambassador John Davis said
he hoped regular shipments of food will reduce shortages, the state
news agency PAP reported.
   ``We need more the means of production than the product itself
... but I am thankful for this help because it will enable us
peaceful reforms,'' Walesa said at his weekly news conference.
   ``I urge everyone to produce food here,'' he said. ``For
example, it would be better if Americans could send the equivalent
in combines and machines and then the farmers could produce in
Poland.''
   Walesa will be able to deliver his message in person next week,
when he leaves for his first trip to North America. He will visit
Canada on Nov. 11-13 and then go to the United States, where he
will address Congress on Nov. 15.
   President Bush has been under pressure from Democratic
congressional leaders to increase the aid he proposed for the first
East bloc country not led by a communist.
   But Walesa said he is going to the United States ``to gain
friends and not to divide them'' and won't let himself be drawn
into a political struggle.
   ``Right at the airport I am going to say, `I am coming here only
to thank you and ask for understanding for the Polish reforms.
Please do not use me for election purposes and political aims
because they are your own internal problems and not our problems.'''
   Walesa said the journey represents ``my most difficult trip.''
   While he intends to thank Americans for their support over the
years, he said he also ``will try to urge the United States to turn
their eyes to Poland, especially in the time of reforms, and to
take part in those reforms.''
   Walesa, who was not allowed to travel abroad for seven years
after martial law was imposed to crush his independent union, made
his first foreign trip in 1988 to France.
   Since then, he has visited several European countries and it was
reported Thursday he will go to Britain on Nov. 29 at the
invitation of the General Council of the British Trade Union
Congress.

   Soldiers killed at least 600
Libyan-backed guerrillas and seized grenade launchers and artillery
in an attack on a rebel base near the border with Sudan, the
Foreign Ministry announced Thursday.
   The battle Monday left another 187 rebels wounded, the ministry
said in a statement. There was no mention of casualties among
government troops.
   The attack followed two weeks of incursions into Chadian
territory by the Libyan Islamic Legion, supported by Libyan leader
Col. Moammar Gadhafi, the statement said.
   Among the dead were Adoum Haggar and Mahamat Deleo, former
Chadian military officers who sought refuge in Libya following an
unsuccessful attempt in April to topple President Hissene Habre,
the statement said.
   The site of the base was not disclosed, but the statement
claimed Libyan agents operating in the western Sudanese province of
Darfour have been directing ``aggression against Chad.''
   Chad has long accused the Sudanese government of allowing Libya
and the rebel movements it supports to launch attacks from Darfour
into eastern Chad.
   The ``few'' rebels who survived the 12-hour battle fled to
support camps in Libya, the statement said.
   Chadian troops captured 17 artillery pieces, machine guns, 11
trucks, 60 grenade launchers, radio transmitters and medical
supplies, the statement said.
   The Foreign Ministry said the Libyan Islamic Legion is comprised
mostly of ``thousands of Chadian and Sudanese workers in Libya''
forced to take up arms against Chad after a short period of
military training.
   The incursions by the rebels violate an agreement reached
between the two countries Aug. 31 in Algeria to end 16 years of
hostilities, the ministry said.

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said
Thursday he was determined to open the United States to any Jew
wanting to leave the Soviet Union.
   Thornburgh, speaking to the national Civil Rights Committee of
the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, said immigration quotas
limit the number of Soviets to 50,000 annually, but the Bush
administration has proposed an increase of 30,000.
   ``We must see that the window of emigration that is now open is
left open,'' he said. ``The United States has been a beacon for
those who aspire to breath the fresh air of freedom, and we don't
want to slam a door in the face of anyone who seeks to come here.''
   Thornurgh spoke about his recent trip to the Soviet Union, where
he met with activists, and said everyone agreed the new openness
instigated by Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev had truly brought
change.
   ``In 1976, when I was last in the Soviet Union, only 787 Jews
were allowed to emigrate to the United States,'' the attorney
general said. ``In 1990, there will be more than 100,000
applications.''
   Soviet Jewish emigration has increased dramatically under
Gorbachev, from 8,000 in 1987 to 19,000 last year and a projected
35,000 in 1989. Non-Jewish emigration this year is expected to
reach 15,000.
   But new U.S. immigration rules have aroused some fears that
Soviet Jews could forced to go elsewhere. Under rules effective
Oct. 1, Soviet Jews no longer can leave that country with visas for
Israel, then apply in Vienna or Rome for refugee status in the
United States. Instead, the refugees' paperwork is being processed
at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, the same as any other would-be
immigrant's.

   A measles epidemic has killed 17 people and
hospitalized hundreds in Southern California this year, racing
through vulnerable ethnic communities and college campuses, public
health officials said.
   While outbreaks of measles have been reported this year in
Chicago and Houston, the epidemic in five Southern California
counties is the nation's biggest and has sputtered and flared for
more than two years.
   ``It's very hard to keep control in a large urban area where you
have a large influx of people from other countries,'' Dr. Gary
Euler of the San Bernardino County Public Health Department said
Thursday.
   State health officials also have been forced to contend with a
shortage of vaccine, said Dr. Loring Dales, chief of immunization
for the California Department of Health Services. And vaccine
prices jumped sharply in 1988 as the demand for inoculations soared
30 percent, Dales said.
   Dales blames the epidemic on the lack of immunization among
children.
   In recent weeks, at least eight University of California at Los
Angeles students have contracted measles, threatening another
flare-up.
   At least 1,629 cases have been reported in Los Angeles County
alone since the stubborn outbreak began in August 1987, said Chuck
Alexander, director of immunization for the Los Angeles County
Health Department. That includes 12 deaths so far this year and two
reported in 1988.
   Another 1,259 cases have been counted in 1989 in San Bernardino,
Riverside, Orange and San Diego counties, including five deaths in
San Bernardino.
   Typical measles symptoms include fever, headache, sore eyes,
heavy coughing and a rash blossoming in the fourth or fifth day,
Dales said.

   A nun who received threatening letters
while working as a religious educator in Guatemala disappeared
Thursday from a retreat house there, members of her order said.
   Sister Diana Ortiz, 31, had been praying alone in a courtyard at
the Belene Sisters Retreat House in Antigua between 8 and 9 a.m.
when she disappeared, said Sister Mary Elizabeth Dallard, of the
Mount St. Joseph Ursuline Sisters of Maple Mount, Ky.
   Members of the Roman Catholic order fear Ortiz has been
kidnapped, but no group has claimed responsibility for the
disappearance, The Courier-Journal of Louisville reported in
Friday's editions.
   Ortiz, a native of Grants had received at least seven
threatening letters since January, all warning her to leave the
country, Dallard said.
   Dallard said Ortiz would not have wandered off. When others at
the retreat center finished breakfast, Dallard said, Ortiz was gone
and her shawl was found on the ground.
   Ortiz and two other Ursuline sisters were in the Central
American country to work as religious educators in the village of
San Miguel Acatan.
   Some of the letters said ``The military know you're here,''
``Don't ever go around alone,'' and ``There's people here that want
to hurt you,'' Dallard said, adding that Ortiz had asked her to
keep the letters for evidence in case something happened.
   ``There's no logical reason why anybody would have anything
against her,'' Dallard said. ``She did a lot of work with little
kids. There's no way anybody could find anything subversive in what
she was doing.''
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Dave Denny said the
U.S. embassy in Guatemala City has a report on Ortiz, and the
Guatemalan police also have been given a missing person report.
   The police wait 24 hours before doing anything to see if a
missing person turns up, he said.

   U.S. and Soviet officials are jockeying over
expectations for next month's summit between President Bush and
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, debating whether it will be merely a low-key
meeting or a milestone in superpower relations.
   Planning for the Dec. 2-3 summit took a leap forward Wednesday
with the announcement that the talks will be held in the
Mediterranean on ships off the coast of Malta.
   ``I think that this meeting can just be the end of the Cold
War,'' said Soviet spokesman Gennady Gerasimov. ``The Cold War will
be dumped down to the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea.''
   Gerasimov's dramatic prediction stood in stark contrast to
Bush's portrayal of the talks as a relaxed opportunity for a
get-acquainted session with no expectation of any agreements.

   The recent string of accidents aboard Navy
vessels may just be due to bad luck, rather than a lack of training
or poor equipment, congressional military experts say.
   But one civilian specialist who's studied hazards aboard
aircraft carriers warns that budget cuts in Navy training could
lead to more accidents.
   ``Congress is always trying to cut training budgets. But if a
pilot can't practice flying, those on the deck don't get trained
either. ... It's a prescription for an accident,'' said Karlene
Roberts, an industrial psychologist participating in a five-year
study of Nimitz-class aircraft carriers and hazardous industrial
systems.
   Overall, Ms. Roberts said, the Navy's safety record ``is
excellent.''
   From Sunday's jet crash aboard the aircraft carrier USS
Lexington that claimed five lives to Wednesday's fire aboard the
oiler USS Monongahela, the week has brought a series of accidents
that has left Navy brass shaking their heads.

   A federal judge in Medellin was
assassinated as she opened her garage door and a congressman was
murdered as he arrived home in a taxi, the two latest apparent
victims of the drug lords' war on the government.
   Mariela Espinoza was the second judge slain since the government
began its crackdown on traffickers 11 weeks ago. The murdered
congressman, Luis Francisco Madero, was an active opponent of the
powerful drug bosses.
   No one claimed responsibility for Wednesday's killings, but
suspicion immediately fell on the traffickers.
   Colombia's 5,000 judges and other court workers hinted at a new
strike. The judicial employees, who struck for three days after
another Medellin judge was slain Oct. 17, say the government has
not done nearly enough to protect them.

   The Los Angeles Herald Examiner, once the
nation's largest afternoon newspaper, published its last edition
today, announcing its bittersweet farewell with the headline ``So
Long, L.A.''
   Hearst Corp. attributed its closure of the 86-year-old newspaper
to heavy losses of up to $2 million a month and a lack of suitable
buyers since the paper was put up for sale last summer.
   The announcement of the closing, which leaves the nation's
second-largest city with just one newspaper, came Wednesday from
Robert Danzig, general manager of Hearst Newspapers, who spoke from
atop the newsroom's copy desk.
   ``Although operating at a financial deficit for more than two
decades, there was never a deficit in the quality and the vigor of
its editorial commitment to the people of Los Angeles,'' he said.
``It has been a losing business, but a winning newspaper.''

   The warden of the state prison where 123
people were hurt during two nights of riots was suspended after
guards charged officials did nothing about broken cell locks before
the second night of upheaval.
   Corrections Commissioner David S. Owens Jr. suspended Robert
Freeman, the prison's superintendent, on Wednesday. But Owens said
he ``will not publicly disclose or confirm the alleged facts in
order to preserve Superintendent Freeman's due process rights and
to maintain the integrity of the ongoing investigation.''
   The suspension was announced two hours after The Associated
Press reported that guards said inmates could go on a second
rampage because officials failed to fix broken control boxes after
the first night of riots.
   More than 15 correctional officers told AP the prison
administration was alerted, but ignored the problem.

   Jessica McClure, the toddler pulled from an
abandoned well as the nation watched rescuers struggle for 58
hours, is now 3 years old and capable of stealing the spotlight
from even President Bush.
   Bush scooped the Midland, Texas, girl into his arms Wednesday
during a White House ceremony honoring Sioux City, Iowa, for its
response to the crash of a United Airlines jumbo jet.
   Jessica grabbed Bush's glasses off his face and faced the
clicking cameras with them balanced on her nose.
   Even as he walked into the Roosevelt Room to present the Midland
Community Spirit Award to Sioux City, Jessica did not appear
impressed.
   ``Who's that, mama?'' asked the blue-eyed girl in a red corduroy
smock with Winnie the Pooh on the front, tossing her ponytail.

   President Bush appeared to reopen on Thursday
the possibility he may seek a renewal of military aid for the
Nicaraguan Contras, saying ``we will leave our options open'' now
that the Sandinista government has resumed military attacks.
   Speaking to reporters after visiting El Salvador's ailing former
president, Jose Napoleon Duarte, Bush accused Nicaraguan President
Daniel Ortega of waging a ``military and intimidation campaign'' by
calling off a 19-month old truce.
   The administration has sent out mixed signals over the past two
days about the possibility of asking Congress to restore lethal aid
to the Contras.
   Bush left open that option on Tuesday but his spokesman, Marlin
Fitzwater, suggested on Wednesday that possibility was not being
serious considered.

   President Bush and Senate Republicans offered
Thursday to end their attempts to attach a capital gains tax cut to
crucial debt legislation, all but conceding defeat for the year on
what has been Bush's top legislative priority.
   ``We have tried to work constructively and cooperatively with
the Congress in a true spirit of bipartisanship,'' said a statement
from the president. ``Now the stalemate must be broken.''
   With an increase in the national debt limit needed next week to
stave off a default by the Treasury, Senate Minority Leader Bob
Dole, R-Kan., told Democrats that Republicans would agree to limit
amendments to the debt-ceiling legislation to those repealing a
Medicare tax to finance catastrophic illness coverage and a tax
provision opposed by business.
   ``No capital gains amendment will be offered,'' he said on the
Senate floor minutes after a meeting with top White House officials
including Chief of Staff John Sununu, Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady and budget director Richard Darman.

   Rear Adm. Richard Milligan said Thursday he
has ``no fear'' of investigations by skeptical members of Congress
into his report on the battleship Iowa explosion.
   ``I think the ultimate conclusion is going to be that they are
going to support my investigation'' and conclusion that gunner's
mate Clayton Hartwig most likely caused the April 19 blast that
claimed 47 lives, Milligan said in an interview.
   Since Milligan, a 30-year Navy veteran who oversaw the Navy's
technical and criminal study, issued his report on Sept. 7, it has
been questioned and criticized by members of Congress, Hartwig's
family and the sailor's former shipmates.
   At the time it was issued, Navy officials acknowledged that
their evidence was circumstantial, given the fact that all the
witnesses, including Hartwig, died in the explosion.

<HEAD>Stock Market: An Imbalance of Questions and Answers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The controversy over computer-programmed trading
of stocks is compelling investors to review basic assumptions about
the very definition of a marketplace.
   In some ways, the search for that definition is clouded by
details and the fury of the fighting, by vested interests defending
their views and attacking their opponents, and by the enormous sums
of money involved.
   Away from the immediate fray, however, random discussions with
investors and others suggest there still is some agreement on what
services should be provided by a functional market.
   Among them: it must bring buyer and seller together for the
transaction of business, it must handle trades quickly, fairly and
efficiently, and it must establish a reasonable sense of values.
   In specific regard to a stock market, there seems to be
agreement that it must raise capital for industry, allow investors
equal access to buying and selling and facilitate their
participation in corporate ownership while establishing relative
values, providing liquidity and avoiding volatility.
   How well America's financial markets are handling such
obligations is therefore at the heart of the argument over program
trading, which has been accused of causing or exacerbating
explosive price movements on heavy volume.
   In essence, the most common form of such trading is so-called
index arbitrage, or short-term, computer-triggered buying or
selling to exploit brief pricing inconsistencies between spot and
futures markets.
   Individuals aren't likely to be involved, because it takes
millions of dollars to even qualify. But for certain brokers and
pension fund managers, millions of dollars are no obstacle to
playing this game.
   Among the arguments against it are these: it tends to cause or
exacerbate big price swings, it undermines valuations, it serves
little economic purpose, it threatens price collapses, and it
drives individuals from the market.
   At the extreme, some investors view today's marketplace as a
gathering ground for reckless game-playing by privileged traders
and program trading as a device letting large investors skim
profits without risk or responsibility.
   In short, they view recent events as a numbers game played by
intelligent computers, rather than individuals investing in values
_ something of a chess game in which computers instantly process
myriad possibilities.
   But shouldn't a free market be able to accommodate anything
tossed at it? It might be true in concept, but rarely in practice.
Markets of all sorts, even those in relatively simple bartering,
have rules, regulations and limitations.
   Random, informal samplings of opinion suggest that individual
investors aren't totally against program trading. Most likely,
ordinary people do not automatically fear big dollars or great
speed, as in computer trading.
   They recognize that computers are changing life, and that to
resist change might also be to resist opportunity. They know life
evolves in unanticipated ways and ways not easily understood, and
that they must remain current.
   Among questions now puzzling people, however, is instability.
For years the nation's stock exchanges boasted of their ability to
maintain generally smooth trading patterns with relatively minor
price changes between transactions.
   Now investors are told to expect greater volatility in the
future than they were accustomed to in the past, and they wonder if
this isn't an admission of market failure, or at least of an
unhealthy situation.
   What has happened, they ask, to the ability to quickly match
buyer and seller?
   Why can't the damage be contained without requiring the
reassurance of government?
   Why can't the same technology that made program trading possible
be employed to accommodate, or at least reduce the negative impact,
of program trading?
   Everyone is asking questions, and very few people are providing
answers.
   Just as an imbalance of buyers and sellers creates marketplace
volatility, it seems that an imbalance of information creates
questions to be answered.

   The manned station Freedom, an
orbiting outpost of America in the icy silence of space, will take
center stage in the U.S. space effort in the 1990s, and be a
springboard for human journeys to the moon and Mars.
   American scientists also expect to reap a rich harvest during
the decade with an armada of sophisticated unmanned spacecraft that
will explore the planets and peer back into the beginning of time.
   At the same time, the Soviets will continue development of a
space shuttle and exploit their own space station Mir as they
pursue their stated goal of dispatching cosmonauts to Mars early in
the 21st century.
   And the growing space programs of the European Space Agency,
Japan and China will expand as they embark on their own manned
space efforts.
   As the new decade begins, America's future course is uncertain.
Its space program is at a crossroads, and it will be up to the Bush
administration, the Congress and the people to decide which
direction it should take.
   In July, on the 20th anniversary of man's first landing on the
moon, President Bush stood on the steps of the National Air and
Space Museum and declared, ``We must commit ourselves anew to a
sustained program of manned exploration of the solar system, and,
yes, the permanent settlement of space.''
   He proposed ``a long-term, continuing commitment'' to completion
of space station Freedom in the 1990s and to a permanent base on
the moon and a manned mission to Mars early in the next century.
   But the president provided no firm timetable or budgets for such
grand schemes, instead directing Vice President Dan Quayle, as head
of the National Space Council, to work out the details.
   Bush is expected to offer a more detailed plan in his State of
the Union address early next year.
   Freedom is the key element in the entire exploration plan, since
it would serve as a training base and launchpad for the more
ambitious flights to the moon and Mars.
   But the space station has had a troubled history. The original
plan called for astronauts aboard space shuttles to begin
assembling it in orbit in 1992, with a total of 20 shuttle flights
needed to have it fully operational by 1995.
   Cost overruns, budget cuts and NASA's poor job of selling the
station to a skeptical Congress have delayed the project, and
initial assembly is now scheduled to start in 1995 or 1996.
   The U.S. cost will be about $25 billion, with European, Japanese
and Canadian partners contributing modules and other station
facilities worth an additional $8 billion. This will give
astronaut-researchers of these nations access to the station and
provide them with valuable experience for developing independent
manned space programs.
   Orbiting 250 miles up, the station would provide living and
working quarters for as many as eight people, with astronauts
rotating back to Earth after four to six months. Some would stay
longer to gain long-term exposure to weightless living, in
preparation for a Mars flight that might take as long as 18 months.
   As a scientific base, the station will allow humans to study the
stars and planets from the pollution-free environment of space. The
weightless world will permit the processing of new, pure medicines,
metals and other products that cannot be made in Earth's gravity.
And astronauts aboard Freedom would assemble, service and repair
satellites and send them out to explore space.
   Space science is experiencing a resurgence after years of
neglect because of tight NASA budgets.
   ``We are embarking on a golden age of space science,'' said
Lennard Fisk, the agency's associate administrator for space
science and applications. ``What's coming up is an era of
unprecedented excitement and activity.''
   Among the events scheduled in the 1990s:
   _Magellan, launched from a space shuttle last May, is to orbit
Venus next August and will study that planet for several years.
   _Galileo, launched from a shuttle in October, is to orbit
Jupiter in 1995 and fire a probe into its atmosphere. En route,
Galileo will probe Venus and take the first closeup look at an
asteroid.
   _COBE (Cosmic Background Explorer), set for launch Nov. 19, will
spend years studying how stars and galaxies were formed by
analyzing cosmic background radiation consisting of particles of
light, or photons, permeating the universe.
   _ROSAT, a cooperative mission with West Germany, will be
launched next year to send back a detailed survey of X-rays emitted
into the universe by violent explosions, such as those occurring at
the end of a star's life.
   _Hubble Space Telescope, to be launched from a shuttle next
March, will enable astronomers to observe stars and galaxies so far
away that they will be viewing these remote bodies as they existed
14 billion years ago, near the time scientists believe the universe
was formed.
   _Mars Observer will be launched in 1992 to orbit the red planet
for a multiyear examination.
   _Other payloads scheduled for deployment from the shuttle in the
next few years include a series of Astro spacecraft carrying
ultraviolet and X-ray telescopes to study quasars, pulsars and
other celestial objects; the Gamma Ray Observatory to explore gamma
ray sources throughout the universe, and Ulysses, to probe the sun.
   During the 1990s, NASA will also continue research, together
with the Defense Department, on developing the National Aerospace
Plane, which would take off from a runway like a jet plane and
accelerate into orbit. If Congress provides adequate funding for
this next-generation manned space vehicle, a prototype could begin
test flights late in the decade, and it could become operational
sometime after 2000.

   Astronomers soon will be able to
look out almost to the beginning of time, to study how the universe
began and how it has evolved.
   Their ``window'' will be the Hubble Space Telescope, the most
expensive, most finely crafted unmanned space vehicle ever built.
   Scheduled for release into Earth orbit next March by a space
shuttle crew, the $1.7 billion telescope will become astronomy's
most significant tool in expanding our knowledge of the universe
during the 1990s and into the 21st century.
   ``It will be one of the premier science missions of this
century,'' said Lennard Fisk, director of space sciences for the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   Orbiting 370 miles high, this 25,500-pound, 43.5-foot-long
package of precision instruments will look seven times more deeply
into space, detect objects 50 times fainter and view them with 10
times greater clarity than the best ground-based observatory, thus
expanding the universe visible to humans by 350 times.
   At the heart of the telescope, named for Edwin P. Hubble, a
trailblazing American astronomer of the 1920s, is a 94.5-inch
primary optical mirror, the most precise ever made. There is no
bump or ripple on its highly polished surface that deviates more
than one-millionth of an inch from an ideally perfect curve.
   From its vantage point outside Earth's murky atmosphere, the
telescope will be able to probe a distance of 14 billion light
years, offering views of galaxies so distant they will appear as
they were when the universe was formed. The best ground telescopes
look back only 8 billion years.
   Astronomers enhancing the telescope's images with computers will
gain new knowledge about black holes, pulsars, cosmic dust clouds,
gaseous nebulae, supernovae, neutron stars, quasars and other
celestial mysteries.
   Said James Westphal, a California Institute of Technology
planetary scientist, ``I suspect that we will find some amazing
things that will thrill the public, not once a year but maybe once
a month.''

   Jennifer Rainey's assessment of summer
vacation used to be: three long months of boring.
   That was before she transferred to Fairmount Elementary School,
where students attend class year-round and summer break is replaced
by four minivacations that fall just when a sixth-grader needs them.
   ``It gives you something to look forward to,'' said Jennifer,
11. ``You think, `Hey, a couple more weeks of this and then I get
three off.' I like it this way because it seems like you get more
time off.''
   Jennifer's is the nation's longest-running, year-round school.
Francis Howell School District, just west of St. Louis, pioneered
the concept in 1969 in an effort to solve overcrowding but today
education reformers think the idea may be just what the country
needs to improve its educational system.
   ``We're asking schools to do more and more, but we're keeping
the clock and the calendar the same. You can't fit 10 gallons into
a five-gallon can,'' said Ernie Boyer, former U.S. commissioner of
education and now the head of The Carnegie Foundation for the
Advancement of Teaching in Princeton, N.J.
   Students spend the same number of days in class, but instead of
a summer vacation they get shorter breaks throughout the year. More
and more schools are scrapping traditional schedules in favor of
the more efficient year-round ones, and no one seems to be
complaining.
   ``I'm convinced that a longer school year is inevitable because
of the need to ... meet the changing work and family patterns of
the nation,'' Boyer said.
   This year, an estimated 475,000 students in 19 states _ less
than 1 percent of the nation's students _ attend year-round
schools, said Charles Ballinger, executive director of the National
Association for Year-Round Schooling.
   But that's twice as many as five years ago, he said.
   Ohio has the longest school year, with 182 days, and Minnesota
has the shortest with 170, according to the Education Commission of
the States. The Missouri Board of Education plans to ask the
Legislature to increase its 174-day year _ the nation's
second-shortest _ to 200 by the year 2000. Thirty-four states use
180-day school years.
   Even if the school year isn't lengthened, many educators say a
year-round schedule makes sense. Some say it improves learning.
Others say it helps ease overcrowding and puts school buildings to
work full time.
   ``The traditional, agricultural calendar has no value to us any
longer,'' said Norman Brekke, superintendent of the K-8 Oxnard
School District in Ventura County, Calif. ``As a matter of fact,
the nine-month calendar and the fact that schools are out for three
months of the year is a costly extravagance, which I don't believe
our society should accept.''
   Brekke said his district saved $16 million _ the cost of two new
schools _ by converting to year-round classes in 1976, and test
scores have improved.
   Supporters of year-round schooling include the Missouri National
Education Association, which recently issued a task force report
recommending that all of the state's schools consider year-round
programs.
   In California, state law requires districts to file a
feasibility study on year-round schools or have a program to be
eligible for some building funds.
   Utah also has provided incentives for consideration of
year-round plans and some inner-city districts must have year-round
schooling by the 1990-91 year.
   However, some educators say that while they like the idea, it's
not always workable.
   In St. Louis, for example, Superintendent Jerome Jones said the
buildings aren't equipped for year-round instruction; most aren't
air-conditioned, and the district already is strapped for money to
pay for paint and plaster.
   ``Personally, I think it's desireable,'' Jones said. ``If it
were possible, I would explore it.''
   Even the Francis Howell district has found it's not workable at
the secondary level. An experiment with a junior high school failed
because of the problems presented by extracurricular activities
like sports.
   Another group that's not exactly thrilled is the summer camp
industry.
   ``People are very concerned about what could happen, but at the
moment, the impact hasn't been significant,'' said Shirley Walch,
who heads the American Camping Association's Southern California
section. ``Some of our camps can accommodate and adapt and then
there are some that could be devastated by it.''
   Administrators at Fairmount say their system is supported by
students, teachers and parents.
   ``It's a system that's worked very effectively,'' said Principal
Larry Smith. ``The burdensome part is developing the schedule,
staffing the building and the movement of students and teachers in
school.''
   Fairmount students are split into four cycles and attend class
for nine weeks, followed by three weeks off. The start of each
cycle is staggered, so that at any given time, three cycles are in
session and one is off. Classrooms are always filled.
   The system is not without some drawbacks, though. Teachers say
the biggest headache is moving.
   ``A classroom teacher rotates with her students, so when you go
off cycle on your three-week break, you move out of your classroom
so another teacher and class can move in,'' said teacher Chris
Guinther. ``So you end up having to pack up your teaching materials
and supplies. Logistically, it's a problem.''
   Ideally, when overcrowding is not a factor, a year-round school
has only one cycle and teachers don't have to move.
   For working parents, the biggest concern is arranging for child
care when their vacations don't coincide with their kids'. Some
children use the time to visit grandparents or enroll in YMCA or
other activities.
   When the schedules do coincide, said Fairmount Assistant
Principal Pat McCoy, ``Then it's an advantage because you can take
your kids to Disneyland in September or October and you don't have
to take them out of school and you miss all the crowds.''

<DATELINE>BOLOBEDU, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Johannes Makoti started out as a
$12-a-week mechanic in this sun-baked village. Today he is a
millionaire, the owner of 13 businesses and one of a handful of
South African blacks who have surmounted countless legal and
financial obstacles to make fortunes.
   He's often on the job at one or more of his businesses, which
include a taxi fleet.
   One recent day, he was found repairing the brakes on one of his
five taxi-vans. He's also worked as the attendant at his gas
station, the waiter at his restaurant and the checkout clerk at his
supermarket.
   He's carried bread across rain-swollen rivers to his bakery
because delivery trucks couldn't travel the washed-out dirt road
that links Bolobedu to the outside world.
   Makoti is at work by 6 a.m. to make sure his Makoti Cafe opens
on time, and he's usually there at 9 p.m. when it closes.
   In between, he and his two wives supervise 87 workers at the
Makoti Garage, the Makoti General Shopping Center, the Makoti
Supermarket, the Makoti Bar Lounge, the Makoti Motel and Restaurant.
   ``I had a dream in 1962 that one day I would become a successful
businessman,'' said the burly, soft-spoken Makoti, now 49.
   ``I told my friend about it and he didn't believe me then. Now
he does.''
   He estimates his businesses are worth more than 7 million rand
(about $2.5 million).
   Others among South Africa's 28 million blacks, long denied
opportunities in the Africa's most prosperous economy, now run
businesses ranging from one-person street stalls to construction
companies.
   An estimated 100,000 black-owned taxi-vans are carrying more
black commuters than white-owned buses and state-owned trains.
About 40,000 blacks operate ``spaza shops,'' small groceries run
from their homes.
   A recent survey of 100 leading black entrepreneurs by Tribute
magazine found more than 40 own businesses worth at least $370,000.
   Many of the legal obstacles confronting black businessmen have
fallen away in recent years, but a lack of experience and
difficulties in raising capital can stifle even ambitious
entrepreneurs.
   In addition, black business progress has been limited almost
exclusively to major cities. In rural areas such as Bolobedu, part
of the tribal homeland of Lebowa, jobs are scarce and wages low.
   Bolobedu consists of several hundred mud and thatch huts on a
patch of barren red earth 30 miles from the nearest tarred road.
Villagers who get jobs on nearby white-owned farms make about $25 a
month.
   Makoti, the son of a laborer, quit high school and left Bolobedu
to work as a mechanic, first in Johannesburg and later in
Phalaborwa, about 55 miles outside his hometown in South Africa's
northeast corner.
   In 1971, he bought a used De Soto and began a taxi service,
transporting his work colleagues between Phalaborwa and Bolobedu on
weekends.
   A year later he had saved enough to buy two used taxi-vans and
hire a driver. He then quit his job and became Bolobedu's first
tycoon.
   He started with a cafe, then added a gas station, supermarket,
liquor store, barber shop, driving school, and he's still building.
   Makoti said he repeatedly has been turned down for bank loans,
so he started his own construction company and built his own
businesses brick by brick.
   ``When I started, there were no businesses here at all,'' said
Makoti. ``I have tried to improve the situation, to create jobs.''
   He has built a health clinic, now run by the homeland
government, and sponsors a soccer club and a troupe of traditional
dancers.
   Makoti and his wives, Elizabeth and Melita, live simply and
seldom leave Bolobedu. He says he's never taken a vacation, unless
one counts a business trip in 1983 to visit factories in Japan,
Hong Kong and Taiwan.
   His only luxury is a 22-room, ranch-style house, which was
heavily damaged by a fire in 1988, a year after it was built.
   Makoti and his wives now live in two small, circular huts while
the house is being restored. Most of their seven daughters and six
sons, ages 5 to 27, are away at schools.
   Even in an area as impoverished as Bolobedu, Makoti's wealth
earns him more respect than resentment, according to several local
residents. One group of young men said they admired Makoti for
helping develop a village that has long been ignored by the
government.
   The vital concerns in such rural areas are jobs and food, rather
than anti-apartheid political activity.
   In the cities, some black activists are hostile toward wealthy
blacks, believing the capitalist economy is as much a part of white
domination as racial segregation laws.
   ``To be a black achiever today is nothing less than choosing a
cozy seat in the ranks of those who keep our people down,'' Sandile
Memela, a black writer, said in Frontline magazine.
   But in a companion article, journalist Kaizer Nyatsumba assailed
the ``odd logic'' that blacks must live in ``abject poverty ... if
they are to be truly relevant in the fight against apartheid.''

   The best way to avoid traffic jams is to keep
out of automobiles _ a luxury more employees will enjoy in the
1990s as they use computers and phones to ``telecommute'' while
working at home.
   ``The communications revolution is going to have a profound
effect on transportation,'' said Montreal futurist Louis D'Amore.
``We're going to be seeing all sorts of people gainfully employed
through telecommuting.''
   Telecommuting is one of the few developments that might have
``significant impact'' in reducing traffic congestion in the 1990s,
and also can stem air pollution, said John Seymour, vice president
of Southern California business sales for Pacific Bell.
   Less than 1,000 of Pacific Bell's 65,000 employees now work on
computers at home, but the number will rise to about 5,000
telecommuters by the mid- to late 1990s, Seymour said.
   Los Angeles County plans to make 2,000 of its employees
telecommuters within two years, and other large employers are
considering the possibility, he added.
   Seymour said telecommuting ``is just plain good business.''
   ``When you get the employee off the freeway, they tend to have
much higher morale, are happier and, frankly, are much more
oriented toward doing their work in a productive way,'' he said.
``If you have a new mother, she is able to do the job and meet the
demands of being a mother.''
   Telecommuting means less office space is needed for employees.
Seymour also said a single manager can supervise more telecommuters
because employees see working at home ``as a real advantage to
themselves, and generally do higher quality work and more work.''
   Seymour said telecommuting that allows people to shop, bank and
trade stock from home ``is just getting started.''
   Lockheed, Boeing and General Dynamics said recently they are
saving $5 million annually on a joint project by having employees
meet via a cross-country computer network.
   Seymour recently used video teleconferencing to meet with
colleagues in San Francisco, allowing him to avoid flying back and
forth from Los Angeles.
   ``I spent two hours for a two-hour meeting instead of seven
hours,'' he said.

<DATELINE>ANDAJES, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Although high in the Andes and far from
anything else, this village of communal farmers has not escaped a
Maoist guerrillas' terror campaign to disupt nationwide municipal
elections Sunday _ and in the long run the presidential election
next year.
   A column of 30 guerrillas of the Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path)
movement entered Andajes one stormy night and seized Mayor Heraclio
Segundo, four other local officials and a sixth man they accused of
cattle rustling. They then dragged them into the village plaza,
where they killed them with single gunshots to the back of the neck.
   As a result, no candidates are running for office Sunday in
Andajes.
   ``All that people think about is that they will come back, that
there will be more killings,'' said Andres Zuniga Bernabe, a young
farmer.
   The wave of assassinations of mayors and other local officials
in Peru has reached levels unprecedented in the Shining Path's
9-year-old insurgency.
   Latest available figures show that 263 mayors' posts around Peru
are unfilled, nearly all of them in small towns and villages with
little or no police protection.
   In Junin department, in the country's mining and farming
heartland 150 miles east of Lima, only 61 of 122 municipalities
have mayors.
   Some 4,500 candidates registered to run in the nation's nearly
2,000 mayoralty races, but an estimated 400 have resigned in fear,
and government officials expect many more to withdraw before
election day.
   So far this year the rebels have slain 45 mayors. They also have
killed 73 local judges, clerks, councilmen and municipal candidates.
   In October, 22 local authorities were slain. A total of 330
people died in armed clashes and political violence, one of the
highest monthly tolls since the Shining Path launched its
insurgency to topple Peru's elected government.
   Shining Path seeks to install a workers' and peasants' state
patterned on the ideas of the late Chairman Mao Tse-tung of China.
   Political analysts and counterinsurgency experts agree that the
rebels' campaign to disrupt the municipal elections is only the
first stage of their strategy to block the presidential election in
April and provoke a military coup.
   Shining Path's strategy then most likely would be to place
itself in the vanguard of a popular front against a military
dictatorship.
   Publicly, the populist government of President Alan Garcia has
guaranteed that municipal elections will take place throughout Peru.
   But privately a close Garcia aide, speaking in Lima on condition
he not be identified, said, ``The truth is we are not in a position
to guarantee the normal course of elections. I wonder how many
people are going to be able to vote.''
   He said Peru would need 300,000 policemen, not the 75,000 it
has, to provide around-the-clock protection to current authorities
and all municipal candidates.
   National election board officials are focusing their efforts on
guaranteeing that voting takes place in a normal fashion in Lima
and other major cities, where most of Peru's population of 21
million is concentrated.
   A third of the national territory is under states of emergency
that suspend constitutional guarantees and give the military broad
powers to fight guerrillas.
   It is in those areas that the elections are most in doubt, but
many critics of government policy say the contested regions cannot
be written off if Peru is going to defend its democratic system.
   Here in Andajes, situated on the dome of an 11,000-foot
mountain, people feel the government has knowingly let them pass
into the Shining Path's domain.
   Andajes is only 90 miles north of Lima in a straight line, but a
six-hour ride over bumpy roads that rise from the mist-shrouded
desert coast and climb the empty western slopes of the Andes.
   With its 2,000 inhabitants, its narrow cobblestone lanes and its
mud-brick houses, Andajes never received much attention in Lima.
But now the villagers feel totally abandoned.
   ``The people live with the fear that Sendero will return,'' said
village elder Ruben Torres.
   The 16-man police detachment sent to Andajes after its officials
were killed withdrew in June to the town of Churin, an hour's drive
away at the foot of the mountain.
   ``Most people did not sleep that firs night,'' said Nancy Jiron,
a government health worker assigned to Andajes. ``They gathered in
small groups and waited for daybreak. They began to realize they
would have to accept being alone again.''

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While other countries are restricting the use of
asbestos in buildings _ in some cases getting rid of it _ Japan
goes on using it and remains the world's largest asbestos consumer.
   ``It would be a catastrophe if a severe earthquake like the one
in San Francisco hit Tokyo and destroyed buildings like ours,''
said Hikosaburo Yoda, a mechanical engineering instructor at Tokyo
University.
   ``And think about how many buildings containing asbestos are
demolished for reconstruction every day. It's even more scary.''
   About 120 buildings are destroyed every day in Tokyo alone, the
local government says.
   Scientists say that inhaling asbestos can cause fatal lung
damage, including asbestosis and cancer.
   At a recent seminar in Tokyo, Dr. Irving Selikoff, a professor
of medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, urged the
Japanese to cut asbestos consumption and promptly tighten safety
measures.
   The mineral fiber is used in some 3,000 common items, including
walls, roof tiles and automobile brakes.
   Japan considers asbestos contamination an occupational problem
and has compensated 65 victims, including 43 lung cancer patients,
said Teruo Arakawa, a Labor Ministry spokesman. He said he had no
figures on how many had died.
   In work places handling the material, Japan allows 10 times as
much asbestos fiber in the air as the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency _ 2 fibers per cubic centimeter for most kinds of asbestos.
   Japan has decided, however, to set a general limit for asbestos
in the air, effective at the end of this year, but the figure has
yet to be announced.
   It banned the spraying of asbestos insulation in 1975, but
government officials say materials containing asbestos are
indispensable for fireproofing.
   Gov. Shunichi Suzuki of Tokyo, who once promised to make Tokyo
asbestos-free, now says the material is safe ``as long as it's not
sprayed.'' Asbestos is being used in a new city hall building.
   Japan has no plan to follow the U.S. move to ban all
asbestos-containing material from public schools by 1996.
   In 1987, however, the Education Ministry ordered 47,000 public
schools throughout Japan to inspect sprayed asbestos in classrooms
and gymnasiums, said Kiyoshi Sawamoto, an Education Ministry
spokesman.
   Only 1,366, or 3 percent, of the inspected schools reported they
had sprayed asbestos, and some 1,000 have removed it, Sawamoto said.
   More than 50 percent of Japan's classrooms and gymnasiums were
built before 1975, when asbestos was widely sprayed, he added.
   Because it is difficult to learn the locations and condition of
asbestos in buildings, even well-planned demolition is never safe
enough, said Sentaro Yamazaki, a representative of Nippon Asbestos
Abatement Industries Association.
   ``Once fibers are released in the environment, they cannot be
retracted,'' he said.
   No law requires contractors to warn neighbors of building
demolition projects, Yamazaki added.
   The government says Japan used 320,000 tons of asbestos _ 80
percent for construction _ in 1988. The amount will surpass 350,000
tons in 1989, said Akinobu Ito of the All Japan Dockworkers' Union.
   Asbestos factories are required to conduct air samplings twice a
year and report the results, but regardless of the outcome, there
are no provisions for penalties or mandatory health checks, said
Jun Sakamoto, spokesman for the Environmental Agency.

<HEAD>Special on Gary Cooper Airs on TNT</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Newsfeatures Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``His name was Gary Cooper. In a time now fast
receding, he was the greatest of all movie stars.''
   That's how ``Gary Cooper: American Life, American Legend,''
begins, as written by Richard Schickel and narrated by Clint
Eastwood. The one-hour TNT special's first showing is Sunday at 8
p.m. EST.
   Maria Cooper Janis, painter and only child of Gary Cooper,
agrees with the statement.
   The idea for the special was hers. She wanted, through film
clips and home movies, to show her late father as a man and an
actor to viewers born since his death at 60 in 1961. ``There was
diversity in roles he was able to portray. It wasn't just the
stereotyped Westerner.''
   And she wanted to show his values. ``He liked to play roles that
pointed up a sense of valor and quality in human behavior. Playing
Sergeant York and Lou Gehrig gave him his pleasure in life. He
liked the ones that pointed up the best that we can be rather than
the lowest that we can fall to.''
   Mrs. Janis adds, ``Heroes are not uncomplicated. They're not
goody goody. Human conflict and struggle goes on.''
   Her father, she said, ``hated stupid dialogue and unreal
situations.''
   Cooper was famous in movies for brevity of speech. Comics used
to get laughs indicating that all he said was ``Yup.''
   In his private life, his daughter says, ``He wasn't a lecturer
or a pontificator. But he chatted about ordinary things. He had a
wry sense of humor.''
   Her father's fame, she says, did not cause her to have a
troubled childhood, Mrs. Janis says. ``All the trappings, the phony
part that can come into that Hollywood way of life, didn't for them
(her parents) and therefore I had a very solid kind of base.''
   Cooper left his family for five or six years after he met
actress Patricia Neal, which is mentioned in the special. ``Facts
are the facts,'' Mrs. Janis says. ``People live their lives and
things happen and they go through difficult periods.''
   When doctors found that Cooper had lung, colon and bone cancer,
his daughter, who had never wanted to act, recalls, ``I thought
maybe I should try _carry on the family name.'' She took three
lessons. It helped her master a stutter but she realized acting
wasn't for her and returned to painting.
   She chose Schickel, film critic for Time, to write the TV
special because of the foreword he wrote for the book ``Legends.''
``I thought it was the only thing I've ever read about my father
that captured him.''
   Her pianist husband, Byron Janis, is battling arthritis in his
hands and increasingly is turning from performing to lecturing
about Chopin, working for the Global Forum on Human Survival and
composing.
   She asked him to write music for the special. One day, he played
two themes for her. She says, ``I cried at both of them. It was
really like my father had walked into the room.'' He wove them into
``Song for a Hero'' which is part of the soundtrack.
   Sometimes Mrs. Janis gives lectures about growing up in
Hollywood. ``I was in Cincinnati and I said that something which
moved Papa tremendously during the war was going to the South
Pacific to visit the troops. He was nervous and said, `I don't sing
or tell jokes. What can I give the guys?' The captain said, `Coop,
all they want you to do is say the Lou Gehrig speech.' He didn't
know if he remembered it. He said it. Everybody was in silence and
tears.
   ``After my talk a woman came up to me. She said, `I was a nurse
and heard your father do it. You cannot imagine what that meant to
those boys.'''

<HEAD>NBC Klan Movie Earnest, Script Awful</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS `Elsewhere in television' section to UPDATE with `Nightline'
to have live interview with former President Jimmy Carter.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On Sunday night and again on Monday, NBC will
air ``Cross of Fire,'' a two-part tale of a particularly evil Ku
Klux Klan leader in Indiana. It's earnest. Badly written, too.
   Let us put it another way. If you heard a character in a work of
serious TV drama say ``there's lawlessness and loose morals right
here in Indiana,'' would you stay tuned?
   NBC's work of serious TV drama tells of the rise in the 1920s of
a young, handsome, rich Indianapolis Klansman who denies he is
bigoted, likewise the Klan. He insists that each only wants
morality, Prohibition and patrotism.
   A gifted recruiter, he swells Klan membership rolls with such
talk. He also is, in his stiff way, crazed with love for a
beautiful state education worker who only wants to help the
children of black migrant workers learn to read.
   With John Heard as the Klansman and Mel Harris as the educator,
the film also is, in theory, a drama about how the Klan, masking
hatred of blacks, Jews and Catholics, once became a strong
political force in America.
   Based on what NBC calls the true story of Klan leader and
political boss D.C. Stephenson and occasionally using old newsreel
clips of Klan parades and seemingly benign deeds, this could have
been a good two-hour movie.
   But that would have required a decision to either concentrate on
the Klan's rise or on Stephenson _ whom this film eventually shows
as a sham, a drunk and a sadist, one who kidnaps the woman he
professes to love and so viciously abuses her after the kidnapping
that she takes poison.
   Instead, NBC's epic, written by Robert Crais, tries on both
fronts. The result is four long hours of cliches, with a plodding
first part that turns vicious near its end, and a concluding
chapter of courtroom melodrama that features Lloyd Bridges as the
crafty old defense lawyer.
   Complete with a crusading Indianapolis newspaper editor (George
Dzundza) who helps an inexperienced young prosecutor (David Morse)
bring Stephenson (Heard) to justice, this ``Cross'' is almost too
much to bear.
   Heard and Harris each are fine actors. But save for moments when
Heard gets to erupt in drunken rages, their characters are so
wooden they could be a termite paradise. One keeps wondering why
they're so attracted to each other.
   Harris' Madge Oberholtzer also seems naive beyond repair. True,
when he tells her the Klan is going to crown him Grand Dragon and
asks if she knows what that means, she playfully inquires: ``You
turn green and grow scales?''
   But when he blabbers his love for her, all she can say is,
``It's all so confusing, Steve.''
   Well, any woman would be confused by a swain who likes to wear a
purple hood and robe, and start a Klan rally by welcoming the
``Imperial Wizard, Grand Goblins, Exalted Cyclops ... and all
citizens of the Invisible Empire.''
   This would be fine comedy were it not for the brutality he
wreaks on her later on. But even those shocking moments are
followed by passages that continue to exhibit author Crais' ear for
memorable dialogue.
   A good example, uttered in Monday's chapter by a young reporter
after reports of violence against the Klan, is this: ``Sounds to me
like the seeds of a full-blown rebellion against the Klan.''
   Sounds to me like you can miss all this.

   HOSTAGES REMEMBERED _ Saturday is the 10th anniversary of the
seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran by Iranian militants.
Tonight's major network news programs will note this, with ``NBC
Nightly News'' concluding its two-part report on the seizure and
its aftermath.
   ABC's ``Nightline,'' which grew out of ABC's late-night coverage
of the Iran hostage crisis, also plans a one-hour then-and-now
edition that includes a live interview with former President Jimmy
Carter, a spokeswoman says.
   ``Nightline,'' anchored by Ted Koppel, began on Nov. 8, 1979, as
``The Iran Crisis: America Held Hostage,'' anchored by the late
Frank Reynolds.

   On the road, on rails, in the air,
transportation systems may take on a new look in the 1990s. But
some things may never change. This is one of a periodic series of
articles, ``The '90s,'' looking ahead to the promise and peril of
the upcoming decade, in the environment, medicine, technology and
society.

   The 1990s will bring new trolleys and
high-speed trains, and efforts to develop hypersonic planes. But
the decade will resemble the '80s for people stuck in clogged
airports and bumper-o-bumper traffic.
   ``If you're looking at the '90s, the automobile will remain the
dominant mode of travel,'' said researcher Lyn Long, of the
Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of
California, Irvine.
   ``Because of increasing auto ownership and two-worker
households, there will be more cars on the road and the system will
never keep pace,'' she said. Urban traffic congestion will be
``status quo or worse.''
   The Federal Highway Administration says 110 million U.S.
commuters now spend 2 billion hours a year in traffic jams. That
will increase to 10 billion hours by 2005.
   As usual, Southern California will be in the forefront of the
traffic troubles. One study predicts average speed on freeways and
highways in this region will drop from 35 mph to 19 mph by 2010.
   Experts say air pollution and possible oil shortages in the
1990s will spur production of cleaner, higher-mileage cars;
increased use of vehicles that run on methanol, natural gas,
electricity or solar power; construction of more trolleys and other
``light rail'' systems; and more vacation travel by trains, planes
and cruise ships.
   With the nation's expressway system almost complete, increased
attention will be paid to ``traffic management'' measures, like
those credited with keeping Los Angeles freeways free-flowing
during the 1984 Olympics, said Peter Gordon, director of the
University of Southern California's Planning Institute.
   Traffic management includes synchronized traffic lights, metered
on-ramps, carpool and bus lanes, quicker towing at accident sites,
adding narrower lanes without widening freeways, more one-way
streets, reversible traffic lanes, staggered work hours, and limits
on times trucks can move goods.
   But these strategies haven't helped much in the past, and seemed
to work during the Olympics because many people ``were so scared
(by gridlock predictions) that they stopped driving,'' said
Langhorne Bond, ex-president of the American Association of State
Highway and Transportation Officials.
   Dashboard navigation systems that give drivers traffic
information to avoid congestion ``will gradually come into
widespread use between now and the year 2000,'' consultant Robert
L. French wrote recently in The Futurist magazine.
   Twenty-five cars are involved in testing such a system on Los
Angeles' Santa Monica Freeway.
   Beyond 2000, radar cruise controls might allow auto convoys to
speed down freeways at 70 mph, spaced only feet apart. A prototype
will be tested soon near San Diego.
   Toll roads will be increasingly common in the 1990s, Long said.
   Traffic jams also may spur ``road pricing,'' in which road
sensors trigger in-car meters so motorists get billed for using
busy routes during rush hours, she said.
   Gordon said city dwellers fleeing to suburbia will confound
``doomsday forecasts'' of urban gridlock.
   ``Suburbanization is the great decongestant because it spreads
things out and takes pressure off downtown,'' Gordon said.
``Industry follows the labor force into the suburbs, so most
commuting is suburb-to-suburb on less congested routes. That's why
the system hasn't gone to hell already.''
   The Institute of Transportation Engineers, however, said more
than 86 percent of U.S. population growth since 1950 has been in
suburbs, causing ``an explosion in the number of suburb-to-suburb
trips'' and significant increases in suburban road congestion.
   Long said many cities already are adopting low-tech ``light
rail.''
   Such systems exist or are under construction in San Jose, San
Diego, Long Beach and Sacramento in California, in Portland, Ore.,
and Buffalo, N.Y.
   Gordon, however, insisted rail ``has been a flop in cities that
have tried it in the last 20 years. It's been hugely expensive.
It's been a disappointment in terms of ridership, and it's had
almost no impact on traffic.''
   Montreal futurist Louis J. D'Amore countered that oil shortages,
air pollution and traffic congestion mean ``a continuing trend
toward mass transit.''
   Trains with speeds up to 150 mph, such as Japan's ``bullet
trains,'' are under consideration for Los Angeles-Las Vegas, Los
Angeles-San Diego, and Houston-Dallas-Fort Worth. Undersea
Eurotunnel rail linking Britain and France is due for completion in
1993.
   By 2000, high-speed trains also may run in the
Vancouver-Seattle, Boston-New York-Washington and Miami-Orlando
corridors, and ``every major city in Europe will be linked by
high-speed rail,'' D'Amore predicted.
   ``Airports are becoming so congested it will make more sense on
trips of 200 to 300 miles to go by train rather than plane,'' he
added.
   Air travelers face higher fares and worse congestion in getting
to and through major airports, and airlines can grow only by making
medium and smaller-sized airports into ``hubs,'' said Bond, who
headed the Federal Aviation Administration during Jimmy Carter's
presidency.
   Bond said increasing air traffic will prod the FAA to limit
arrivals and departures at more airports.
   Air travelers dreaming of fast trips aboard hypersonic jets will
have to wait 15 to 20 years, Bond said.
   The proposed hypersonic X-30 National Aerospace Plane would soar
up to 25 times the speed of sound, or about 17,000 mph, fly
directly into orbit, then return to an airport. Planners also
envision ``Orient Express'' intercontinental jets traveling up to
8,000 mph to reach any destination in two hours.
   The multibillion-dollar cost of developing such planes has drawn
vocal opposition, and significant technological obstacles remain.
   Bond said aircraft manufacturers will be producing jetliners at
maximum capacity during the decade, all of them quieter,
fuel-efficient planes.
   Growing demand means airlines can't retire older noisy,
fuel-gobbling jets, so noise increasingly will stir political
controversies, he said.
   ``The other significant issue is how to keep these old airplanes
flying safely,'' Bond said. ``It's an interesting technical
challenge and will require work, but I don't anticipate worsening
of the safety record.''

<HEAD>In Several States, Ballot Issues Focus on Children</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE MITGANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Voters in Washington state and Michigan may increase education
taxes, quake-weary San Franciscans may finance a new stadium to
keep their pennant-winning baseball team from fleeing, and Texans
may spare politicians from having to swear they didn't bribe their
way into office.
   In all, voters in 10 states will face 56 statewide issues and
dozens of local ballot measures Tuesday.
   Texas voters tackle the heaviest load: 21 statewide
propositions, including a $500 billion bond issue to extend running
water and sewers to disease-ridden border towns, another to finance
a record build-up of the state's prison system, and one to drop a
113-year-old provision requiring state officeholders to publicly
affirm that they gained their jobs honestly.
   Among other key contests, Maine voters will consider a
non-binding measure asking if they want to ban cruise missile
testing within their state and a second asking whether they approve
of an agreement to dispose of Maine's nuclear waste at a facility
in Beatty, Nev.
   Locally, San Franciscans will decide whether to build a new $115
million ballpark to replace aging, windswept Candlestick Park and
keep the baseball Giants from leaving town. The measure is strongly
backed by Mayor Art Agnos, but polls suggest the
multibillion-dollar expenses from the recent earthquake have eroded
support.
   A second San Francisco ballot measure would allow unmarried
couples, including homosexuals, to formally establish their
relationships as ``domestic partners,'' entitling them to the same
funeral and sick leave benefits as married couples.
   A large turnout is expected in nearby Concord, Calif., where an
ordinance banning discrimination in housing, employment and other
areas against AIDS victims was approved by the City Council but
placed on the ballot after protests by outraged residents who
collected 10,000 signatures.
   Seattle residents will decide a measure that would end forced
school busing and promote educational choice.
   In St. Louis, voters will consider a 4-cent property tax
increase to subsidize the St. Louis Symphony. Symphony officials
said the orchestra has gone as far as it can in raising money from
the wealthy and raising ticket prices. But critics in the Missouri
Legislature have called the symphony elitist.
   Voters in New York City, under U.S. Supreme Court order to
replace its legislative system with a more representative one, will
weigh a complicated charter revision that would strengthen the
mayor and the City Council, while scrapping the 89-year-old Board
of Estimate. The measure is expected to pass easily.
   In Texas, there has been little opposition to Proposition 2,
which would authorize $500 million in bonds for basic water and
sewer systems in the substandard border subdivisions called
colonias. An estimated 200,000 people live in colonias, where
sewage runs in irrigation ditches and dysentery, hepatitis and
tuberculosis are common.
   ``It's sometimes very easy for us who have running water to just
open the tap and get it, and we forget about others who don't,''
said Amalia Lerma of Valley Interfaith, one of the groups backing
the bond issue.
   The package also includes $400 million for water supply, water
quality and flood control projects around the state.
   Texans also will decide whether to approve $400 million in
tax-backed bonds for the biggest prison buildup in state history,
along with new mental health institutions, juvenile corrections
facilities and law enforcement.
   Texas Proposition 13 would enshrine a ``victims bill of rights''
in the state constitution, giving victims the ability to confer
with the prosecutor, receive restitution and get information about
an accused's conviction, sentence, imprisonment and release.
   Another Texas measure would eliminate the oath now taken by
elected officials and others who must swear _ often during public
ceremonies in front of family and friends _ that they didn't bribe
anyone to get their jobs.
   The provision was added to the Texas constitution in reaction to
corruption during the Reconstruction Era. But some now feel the
oath is outdated and undignified.
   In Washington state, Initiative 102, called the ``Children's
Initiative,'' would boost the state's 6.5-cent sales tax by nearly
a penny to provide at least $360 million for social and education
programs.
   Big business led by Boeing Co. recently created a stir by
contributing about $50,000 to opponents of the initiative, who
include Republican conservatives. Opponents brand the initiative a
disguised teacher raise.
   Backers, mainly teacher and public employee groups and social
service organizations, say the unmet needs of children are
staggering. They range from more child protective caseworkers to
handle a growing number of kids taken from crack-addicted parents,
to an overwhelmed system for the developmentally disabled, to
overcrowded classrooms as parts of Washington experiences a surge
in growth.
   In Michigan, voters will consider two ballot proposals, each of
which would raise the state sales tax to provide more money for
schools.
   Proposal A, backed by Gov. James Blanchard, teacher
organizations and major corporations, would increase the sales tax
to 4.5 percent from 4 percent to generate $400 million more for
schools.
   Proposal B, with no organized backing and a tiny budget, would
raise the sales tax to 6 percent, cut property taxes some $1.5
billion and put about $350 million more into schools.
   ``Proposal A has money and B doesn't,'' said state Sen. Dan
DeGrow, a Proposal B backer. ``But they both face an uphill fight.''
   Both, or neither, could pass. If both garner majorities, the one
with the larger one would prevail.
   The Michigan State Chamber of Commerce wants voters to reject
both.
   ``The further we get away from the Capitol, the better the
reception,'' said chamber vice president Richard Studley.
   David Rohde, a political science professor at Michigan State
University, said: ``There is indeed a lot of cynicism, at least
about anything that involves spending money and increasing taxes to
spend money. It's not impossible, but any tax increase has a tough
row to hoe.''

   This is a radio station where Arbitron numbers
are arbitrary; everybody HAS to listen. You can't change the dial.
You can't turn it down. You can't turn it off.
   You can, however, leave the store.
   It's Rite Aid Radio, a station created solely for the drug store
chain. Morning drive, afternoon drive, it doesn't matter _ the only
thing its listeners wheel are shopping carts.
   ``I've had people tell me, `I was standing in a Rite Aid and I
thought I heard your voice.' And I tell 'em, `You did,''' says disc
jockey Dan Taylor, a country music DJ who doubles as the voice of
Rite Aid Radio.
   He's just one of several dozen radio personalities contributing
their voices to POP Radio, which allows chain stores from Toys 'R
Us to Rickel's to Shop Rite to air their own radio stations each
day.
   POP is not what the stations play; it's an acronym for Point of
Purchase, a fast-growing phenomenon in which the stores create
their own format for an in-store sound system.
   They don't want shock jocks or Top 40 screamers; you'll never
hear ``Gooooood Morn-innnnnng, A&amp;P!'' while cruising the frozen
food aisle, or catch ``Highway to Hell'' cranking out while you
check the fresh produce.
   ``The music's not Oingo Boingo. It might be Frank Sinatra, jazz,
Earl Klugh. And you have to reflect that,'' said Taylor, who was
among the first DJs to see the possibilities in POP.
   Taylor is also the voice for the Toys 'R Us station and for
People's Drug. Although the company started out in drug stores, it
has since expanded tremendously: advertising revenues, which were
at $350,000 in fiscal 1985-86, hit $17 million in 1988-89, and more
than 13,000 stores play POP Radio.
   The number of DJs have expanded, too. According to POP Radio
co-founder Bob Grey, there are now 75 disc jockeys providing vocals
for his company _ up from a hardy half-dozen when production first
started.
   Among them is Bob Taylor, who came to New York looking for a job
behind the mike in the nation's largest media market. While he
waited, Food Emporium Radio kept him busy.
   And there's Jeff Shade. By day, he works behind the scenes at
all-sports WFAN-AM, assisting the obstreperous Imus in the Morning;
his other job is as the ``warm and friendly, non-offensive'' host
of the Brooks Drugs in-store show.
   ``It's really a very intimate form of radio. You do have a
captive audience,'' said Shade, who was a morning drive jock in
Philadelphia before coming to New York.
   ``We try not to be offensive in any way, and we're conscious of
that, because it's strictly an advertising medium,'' said Shade.
``We not only don't want to offend the sponsors, but anybody else
in the store _ customers, employees, anybody.''
   There are other things which make POP Radio different from the
average station: There's no cancellations over low Arbitron
ratings. The DJs never give the weather, the sports, the news or
anything else that is ``time sensitive,'' and they don't spin
records.
   In some cases, the music and chatter are beamed in via
satellite; in other cases the music alone is transmitted that way,
and the DJs' rap is sent to the stores on tapes, which are then cut
into the tunes.
   The rap goes like this: ``Rite Aid Radio! Hey moms, taking care
of babies is a full-time job. And right here at Rite Aid, we have
lots of ways to help you help yourself. I'll be right back with
more tips after this.''
   An ad will follow, with the DJ returning to pitch more items.
Then it's back to the music _ generally either adult contemporary
tunes or background Muzak, depending on the store. There are 12
minutes of ads each hour.
   ``The stores want you to inflect your own personality, but each
one wants something different,'' said Dan Taylor. ``One wants
bright and happy, one wants laid-back. ... If you're TALKING LIKE
THIS in a Rite Aid, well, that's not what they want.''
   The company has also added features by various personalities;
the best known of the bunch is Dr. Art Ulene, a science-medical
reporter on NBC's ``Today'' show. But Shade recently discovered you
don't have to be famous to become well-known via POP Radio _
indeed, everybody does have to listen.
   ``I was in a Brooks store in New England on vacation, when I
asked the guy behind the counter for an item. And he recognized my
voice,'' said Shade. ``They were quite shocked that their DJ was
shopping in the store.''

<HEAD>Eds: `Staying Together' opens nationwide Nov. 10.</HEAD>

   Lee Grant is more afraid of boredom than
anything else, and that helps explain how she managed to bring
three films she's directed to the marketplace this fall.
   They are: ``Battered,'' a story of domestic violence against
women (HBO); ``Homeless,'' about a family whose house burns down,
starring Christine Lahti and Jeff Daniels (CBS); and ``Staying
Together,'' a theatrical movie about family survival in a small
town (Hemdale).
   Notice that all three deal with social problems. That's only
natural with Grant, an actress-director who has long been
associated with causes, and who spent 12 years on the film
industry's blacklist because of it.
   Grant recently presented ``Staying Together'' at the Montreal
World Film Festival, where it was well received.
   What makes Lee Grant run? Fear of boredom, yes. A social
conscience, of course. But also a creative drive that has won her
two Academy Awards, as supporting actress in ``Shampoo,'' 1976, and
as director of a documentary about the homeless, ``Down and Out in
America,'' 1987.
   ``Staying Together'' centers on three brothers (Dermot Mulroney,
Tim Quill, Sean Astin) who face a crisis when their father (Jim
Haynie) suddenly sells the family chicken restaurant. When the
father dies, the family starts to disintegrate, but the boys'
mother (Melinda Dillon) brings them back together.
   Grant's producer in all her projects is her second husband, Joe
Feury. ``Staying Together'' proved a surprisingly easy sell for
them.
   ``I have pictures I've tried to get on for 10 years,'' she said.
``I was speaking to John Daly of Hemdale about another film, but he
wasn't interested because it dealt with South Africa; he wasn't
sure of the economic viability. I said I had another script, which
was `Staying Together.' He read it, liked it and gave us the
go-ahead. He said we should go either with names or unknowns
because he thought it was strange to mix the two. We decided to go
with unknowns for the three boys.''
   She filmed ``Staying Together'' on a $7 million budget in the
hamlet of Ridgeway, S.C.
   Grant, a New Yorker, admittedly knows nothing about small-town
life. ``But it's like making a documentary: I want to make the
journey, I want to find out what it's all about and I did. The
townspeople accepted us as part of them.''
   She grew up in Manhattan the daughter of indulgent parents who
encouraged her self-expression. At 18 she was touring as Ado Annie
in a road company of ``Oklahoma!'' In 1949, she drew rave notices
as Meg Mundy in Sidney Kingsley's hit play ``Detective Story.'' She
repeated the role in William Wyler's film version, receiving an
Oscar nomination.
   Grant's career was in high gear when she landed on the
blacklist, apparently because her then-husband, writer Arnold
Manoff, was suspected of being a communist.
   ``I had to teach when I was blacklisted,'' she said. ``I wasn't
allowed to act. In starting to teach so early _ I was 19 _ I
started dealing with actors and working on their problems. I know
that experience put me on the road to being a director.
   ``It's ironic that something I thought was death at the time,
because it took all my ingenue years, turned out to be the very
thing that was my strength.''
   Grant finds a curious parallel between her career and that of
her daughter, Dinah Manoff, who appears in ``Staying Together.''
   ``Dinah got the Neil Simon play `I Want to Be in Pictures,' for
which she won a Tony. Then she got the film with Walter Matthau.
And then there was nothing. So she started as a star with great
acclaim and awards, and then nothing,'' Grant said.
   ``Until she got the series, `The Empty Nest,' it was a real
struggle for her, a kind of trial by fire. I think if she had
gotten everything as easily as she did at the start, she would not
be either the person or the actress that she is today. I saw her go
through the pain and the confusion of `Why did they want me so much
one year, and not want me at all the next?'
   ``In going through all that and keeping on studying and finding
the places in herself that she liked, I think she has become one of
the strongest people I know.''
   What happens to the actress Lee Grant when the director becomes
so busy?
   ``She gets lost,'' Grant sighed. ``Every once in a while she
starts to cry. She starts to get funny feelings that are very
uncomfortable, and I hear myself saying: `I don't feel enough.
What's happening to me?'
   ``I don't connect it to the fact that I'm not feeling on the
level that I feel when I act. That's when I do something. This year
I did `The Achille Lauro' and got all my suffering out of my
system. I felt much better and became a person I could live with
again.''

   She was 16 and home for the holidays from
finishing school. He was 17 and an Andover senior decked out in a
tux for the Christmas dance at a Greenwich, Conn., country club.
   It was December 1941. Three weeks earlier, America had gone to
war. George ``Poppy'' Bush already had decided to enlist as soon as
he turned 18.
   But on this evening, his attention was drawn to the tall,
slender girl with wavy, reddish-brown hair, twirling around the
dance floor in a green-and-red holiday dress with one of his tennis
buddies.
   The friend was happy to oblige Bush with an introduction to
Barbara Pierce of nearby Rye, N.Y.
   Before they reached the floor, the band switched from a Glenn
Miller tune to a waltz that was beyond Bush's dancing ability. So
the couple sat down and talked.
   And talked.
   A few nights later, on their first date, Bush borrowed his
folks' big car _ the one with the radio _ to fill the air in case
conversation faltered.
   But, as writer Donnie Radcliffe recounts in a new biography of
Barbara Bush, ``he need not have bothered.''
   ``Years later he would tease that she started talking that night
and hadn't stopped since,'' writes Radcliffe in ``Simply Barbara
Bush: A Portrait of America's Candid First Lady.''
   The book follows the Bushes from their wartime marriage to the
oil fields of Texas to the political career that led them from
Congress to China and now, after 29 moves in 44 years of marriage,
to the White House.
   Radcliffe, who has covered first ladies and the East Wing of the
White House for The Washington Post since 1969, recalls Bush saying
on a campaign flight last fall that if he won, ``there's one
prediction I'll make ... America will fall in love with Barbara
Bush.''
   ``America did,'' adds Radcliffe. ``In no time at all, her white
hair, her wrinkles, her size-14 figure and her fake pearls became
the new standards by which American women could measure themselves
_ and hope to measure up.''
   She clearly cuts a different figure than the petite ex-actress,
Nancy Reagan, who last occupied 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
   As Mrs. Bush quipped at a 1986 charity dinner: ``As you know, we
have a lot in common. ... She fights drugs; I fight illiteracy. She
wears a size three _ so's my leg.''
   Born in New York on June 8, 1925, she was the third of Marvin
and Pauline Pierce's four children.
   He was an engineer who turned to publishing. She was, in
Barbara's memory, an ``absolutely ravishing'' woman with a green
thumb, an inveterate joiner of civic causes and a spendthrift. The
Pierces lived well, but beyond their means, in a five-bedroom brick
home in upscale Rye.
   When Barbara's older sister Martha went off to Smith College,
Vogue immortalized her on its cover as ``College Girl of the Year.''
   Back home, Barbara was a tomboy, 5-foot-8 and 148 pounds at age
12. She recalls looking ``like Porky Pig.''
   At Ashley Hall, the finishing school in Charleston, S.C., she
set school records at speed-knitting, swimming underwater (2{ times
across the pool) and, according to Radcliffe, ``eating the most
hot, buttured biscuits in one meal without being caught.''
   After that holiday dance, the teen-age couple had a whirlwind,
if long distance, romance, with the letters postmarked ``ANDOVER''
turning up almost daily in Barbara's school mailbox. He took her to
his senior prom at the prestigious prep school outside Boston.
   A few weeks later, Bush joined the Navy and began the training
that would make him its youngest pilot.
   After Barbara's graduation in 1943, she spent 17 days with Bush
and his family at their oceanfront home in Maine, where she was a
hit with Dorothy Walker Bush, the clan's tennis-playing matriarch.
   Barbara dropped out of Smith College in 1944 after her freshman
year, planning to marry Bush in December.
   On Sept. 2, 1944, Bush's torpedo bomber, with ``Barbara''
painted on its side, was shot down by Japanese gunners during a
raid on Chichi Jima.
   Bush bailed out after dropping his four 500-pound bombs; the two
crewman with him didn't make it. An American submarine rescued the
flier, who returned home on Christmas Eve, with a Distinguished
Flying Cross and 58 combat missions.
   The wedding took place a few weeks late, on Jan. 6, 1945.
   Bush was mustered out of the Navy in August and enrolled at
Yale. Barbara worked part-time at the Yale Co-op and boasts that
``by the time we moved from Yale, I knew how to wash diapers and
cook dinner.''
   George Walker Bush, the first of their six kids, was born in
July 1946.
   Bush breezed through Yale in three years, making Phi Beta Kappa
as an economics major, captain of the baseball team, president of
Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity and member of Skull and Bones, the
elite, secret student society.
   They headed off to Odessa, Texas, to embark on a career in the
oil fields.
   Pauline Pierce kept sending her daughter Tide until Barbara
convinced her mother the grocery stores in West Texas were bigger
than the ones in Rye. Mrs. Pierce was killed in a car accident in
1949.
   Tragedy struck again in 1953, when doctors told the Bushes their
3-year-old daughter, Robin, was dying of leukemia. They took her to
Sloan-Kettering Memorial Hospital in New York, where Barbara seldom
left her side. The child died 10 weeks before her 4th birthday.
   Her hair began going gray during Robin's illness. For years, at
the suggestion of her mother-in-law, she dyed the gray away, but
abandoned that in 1970, tired of the greenish hue her hair acquired
whenever she swam in a pool.
   Mrs. Bush was always a full-time mother, ferrying the children
to Little League games and myriad other activities, packing them
into the station wagon to drive to Kennebunkport each summer, and
meting out most of the discipline.
   She said earlier this year that when the family nest finally
emptied, ``I went through sort of a ... difficult time really
because suddenly women's lib had made me feel that my life had been
wasted.''
   The blues did not last long. She stepped up her volunteer
activities and discovered a favorite cause: literacy.
   ``I once spent the summer thinking of all the things that
bothered me _ teen pregnancy, drugs, everything _ and I realized
everything would be better if more people could read and write,''
said Mrs. Bush, who also had experienced the difficulties of
helping son Neil overcome dyslexia.
   She is often credited as serving as a goad to her husband's
social conscience.
   At times she has made headlines, including her ``rhymes with
rich'' crack about Geraldine Ferraro in 1984 and support for a ban
on AK-47s after a man killed five children in a Stockton, Calif.,
schoolyard.
   She has since tried to steer clear of public policy statements.
   That ``muzzle'' is nothing new, she told reporters.
   ``I muzzled myself about 1967, when George went into the
Congress,'' she said. ``It's a decision I made many years ago that
when I disagreed with George Bush, I tell him in private.''

   ``For it is incredible how hateful to non-Catholics in all parts
of America is the very name of bishop ...''
   _ The Rev. Ferdinand Farmer, American missionary (1773)
</TEXT>

<TEXT>
   Wearing the bishop's mitre in the Roman Catholic Church in the
United States has never been easy.
   From the day in 1789 when Pope Pius VI established the Diocese
of Baltimore and named John Carroll the first U.S. Catholic bishop,
the church here has had to defend the American way of life before
the Holy See and to calm the fears of non-Catholics that it was
controlled by a foreign power.
   As its bishops meet in Baltimore this week to celebrate the
bicentennial of the Catholic hierarchy in the United States, with a
conservative pope seeking greater central authority and the
abortion battle fueling critics' claims that the church wants to
set moral standards for the nation, the church is still trying to
find its place in the American experiment in democracy.
   ``I think the current leadership of the U.S. Catholic Conference
needs to continue to articulate to the Holy See the unique
characteristics of the United States,'' said Bishop James Malone of
Youngstown, Ohio, past president of the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops. ``The task of Carroll vis-a-vis the Holy See and
the task of the current church leadership vis-a-vis the Holy See is
basically the same.''
   But this time around, the American church is no longer the new
kid on the block.
   The 53 million-member Catholic Church in the United States has
grown from a persecuted minority in an isolated outpost to the
nation's largest religious group and one of the most influential
voices of Catholicism in the world.
   If a pope today tried to correct the errors of ``Americanism''
with a scolding papal encyclical, as Pope Leo XIII did in 1899,
``it just won't be paid attention to,'' said Jay Dolan, a historian
at Notre Dame.
   The United States' revolutionary experiment in democracy made
its mark on the Catholic hierarchy from the start.
   Heeding pleas from 18th century Jesuit missionaries such as
Ferdinand Farmer that appointing a bishop would only antagonize
Americans suspicious of the church's independence from Europe's
Catholic nations, the pope did not appoint Carroll as the first
American bishop until 1789, a century and a half after the church
was established in Maryland.
   One of the first issues the new bishop had to face was
trusteeism. Following the example of Protestant churches around
them, many Catholic churches were run by lay trustees, who even
took upon themselves the role of selecting priests. Carroll trod
lightly on that issue, leaving to his successors the battles to
reestablish the hierarchy's right to appoint priests.
   As American Catholicism grew with waves of immigrants in the
19th century, groups such as the Know-Nothing party and the
American Protestant Association forced the still young and
struggling church to defend itself against charges it was aiming
for ecclesiastical control of the new nation.
   Catholics also experienced more basic persecution. In 1834,
rumors that nuns were murdering illegitimate children in convent
basements prompted rioters to burn the Ursuline Convent in
Charlestown, Mass. Ten years later in Philadelphia, 13 people died
in the torchings of two Catholic churches.
   The challenges confronting the church already had brought its
leaders together in unprecedented fashion as early as 1810.
American bishops gathered, again a highly unusual thing to do in
the church at that time, in Baltimore in 1852, 1866 and 1884.
   At one meeting, the bishops took their first significant social
stand, deciding to defend the Knights of Labor, the first national
union and with a majority Catholic membership, against charges it
was communistic. Cardinal James Gibbons of Baltimore appeared
before the Holy See in 1887 and averted a papal condemnation of the
Knights.
   In the late 1800s, Rome became concerned about the influence on
other nations of such American ideals as religious liberty and
church-state separation, and the ``Americanist'' controversy
erupted.
   Pope Leo XIII's encyclical decrying the idea that the church
should adapt its doctrine to the modern age and that the American
church could be different put a stop to doctrinal ferment for
decades, but U.S. church leaders continued to organize.
   In 1919, the National Catholic Welfare Conference was founded.
The Bishops' Program of Social Reconstruction, which opposed child
labor and urged minimum wage laws and other social reforms, was
published that year. Catholics in other nations didn't begin this
sort of activism until the 1950s.
   ``The church in the United States was very conscious of the way
the U.S. was organized politically,'' said Monsignor Joesph
Gremillion, a scholar-in-residence at Notre Dame. ``The church
(leadership) in the United States felt the need of comparing notes,
consulting with one another, taking positions.''
   The Catholic conference in this country became a model for
national and regional church groups elsewhere. After the 1961-65
Second Vatican Council gave official recognition to national
conferences, the National Conference of Catholic Bishops was formed
in 1966.
   The Vatican, however, may not have been ready for the influence
wielded by the U.S. bishops.
   The papacy, which had assumed that stands on international
issues were its prerogative, ``was somewhat startled'' by the
American bishops' pastoral letters this decade on nuclear war and
the economy, said Gremillion, a former Vatican official.
   The bishops' place in the universal church is still debated
between members of the American hierarchy and the Vatican.
   When John Paul II met with the U.S. bishops in Los Angeles in
1987, he called on them to lift up unpopular Catholic teachings,
saying it is ``a grave error'' to consider dissent from the Holy
See ``totally compatible with being a good Catholic.''
   He was told in turn by Archbishop Rembert G. Weakland of
Milwaukee that ``an authoritarian style is counterproductive, and
such authority for the most part then becomes ignored.'' Archbishop
John R. Quinn of San Francisco said, ``We cannot fulfill our task
simply by an uncritical application of solutions designed in past
ages for problems which have qualitatively changed or which did not
exist in the past.''
   Still, the overall trend is conservative, according to some
church observers. ``We are now in a period of reaction to that
earlier period of the Second Vatican Council,'' said the Rev.
Thomas Reese of the Woodstock Theological Center at Georgetown
University.
   But in the United States, an educated Catholic laity that has
stepped from the pews into the inner sanctum in roles ranging from
parish administrators to eucharistic ministers is not turning back,
some church leaders say.
   ``It amazes me how much people want to do in the church,'' said
Archbishop Daniel E. Pilarczyk of Cincinnati, vice president of the
bishops' conference. ``I think that's wonderful and I could see how
that could be scary. ...
   ``If that gets off the track, it could be a mess. I don't think
it's off the track. American Catholics don't want it to get off the
track.''

   When Marguerite Kirk graduated from law school she got a typical
job for rookie attorneys in 1967, counseling a small number of
clients through the drudgery of personal bankruptcy.
   At that time, the legal profession had bestowed
bottom-of-the-barrel status on personal bankruptcy work because it
was tedious and time-consuming.
   ``We used to meet in the basement of the courthouse,'' Kirk
said, recalling those days when she was an inexperienced lawyer at
a small firm in Augusta, Ga. ``You'd look up and see the pipes
uncovered or dripping. I knew I had to get my feet wet but this was
ridiculous.''
   Today Kirk handles a booming bankruptcy business from an office
in Fort Worth, Texas. She says the stigma once associated with such
cases has diminished, largely because the number of people swamped
in debt has soared and changes in federal laws have made bankruptcy
filing easier.
   More debt-swamped people have been turning to the courts for
relief, ranging from poor dirt farmers to credit-card addicts to
former tycoons such as the Hunt brothers and ex-Texas Gov. John B.
Connally.
   Between 1984 and the fiscal year ended June 30, personal
bankruptcies more than doubled nationwide, to 580,459 from 282,105.
Many attorneys say they expect to see a lot more bankruptcy court
refugees.
   That means more business for lawyers, who are among the first in
line to get paid when a debtor's assets are sold to satisfy bills.
But the personal bankruptcy explosion poses a threat to creditors,
who stand to lose billions when unpaid bills are delayed or
dismissed by bankruptcy courts.
   In response, creditors have been aggressively going after assets
of people whose bankruptcy filings they consider fraudulent or
abusive.
   Visa USA, the nation's largest credit card company, began a
program earlier this year organizing banks to challenge bankruptcy
petitions in court. The project began in Southern California _ an
area of frequent filings _ and has expanded to eight other states.
There's no word yet on its success.
   The American Bankers Association, a trade organization for
commercial banks, recently began a campaign to educate the public
on the use of credit and steps to avoid bankruptcy.
   The association emphasizes that a filing will damage a person's
credit rating for years, which could mean big problems in getting
loans or even another job.
   ``Some people are taking advantage of the system and it's
hurting the industry,'' said Virginia Stafford, an ABA spokeswoman.
   Kenneth R. Crone, head of Visa's Bankruptcy Recovery Program,
said member banks lost $1.5 billion from personal bankruptcy
filings last year, nearly half that from a tiny number of debtors
who ran up bills they never meant to pay.
   Crone said some bankruptcy filers deliberately hide assets or
overstate expenses, while others may have the means to repay debts
but decide to file for bankruptcy anyway, usually at a lawyer's
urging.
   Robert W. Johnson, director of Purdue University's Credit
Research Center, said its most recent survey of 1,200 bankruptcy
filers found half had no hope of repaying debts. But 20 percent
could have repaid all non-mortgage debts within three years, and
three-fifths doubled their net worth after filing.
   ``We're by far the most lenient country in the world. In many
countries your debt is never forgiven,'' said Johnson. ``In fact,
America was settled by people who, in many cases, were fleeing
their creditors in Europe.''
   Many lawyers and financial planners argue that the vast number
of personal bankruptcy filers are up against a financial wall, for
reasons ranging from job loss to medical crisis to divorce.
   They say banks should share blame for the high number of
bankruptcy filings because they are often too lenient in issuing
credit cards.
   ``While consumer spending may drive an economy, it also drives
many onto very thin ice,'' said William Kennedy, a Fort Worth
psychologist, whose clients include personal bankruptcy filers.
``These artificial needs are driven up in us by all the advertising
big business does.''
   Under federal laws, debtors can surrender some assets to repay
part of their debt under a Chapter 7 petition, known as straight
bankruptcy, or keep their assets and repay debt over a three- to
five-year period under Chapter 13.
   Many creditors prefer Chapter 13, but attorneys report that a
far larger number of filings are made under Chapter 7 than 13. In
Kirk's practice the ratio of 7s to 13s is 9-to-1.
   The reason is that the majority who seek bankruptcy court have
experienced a major financial blow and hold little prospect of
making payments.
   Even for those who got into trouble from other reasons, such as
extravagant spending, it's quicker to file under Chapter 7 and the
effect on credit ratings is the same, attorneys claim.
   Some states have laws that prevent non-secured creditors, such
as credit-card companies, from seizing personal assets under
Chapter 7.
   William G., a 44-year-old developer working in southwestern
Florida, found the Chapter 7 petition he recently filed quickly
solved his financial woes. The developer said he wanted to avoid
legal wrangling and millions of dollars in liability over Texas
property holdings that soured.
   He said that by surrendering his interest in an investment
partnership he removed himself from liability but didn't hurt his
credit rating because he kept current on all other debts. The
ability to isolate problem debts is another advantage of filing
under Chapter 7, attorneys say.
   Some creditors, seeking to avoid dealing with personal
bankruptcies, have been relying on bankruptcy-prediction models
provided by major credit-rating bureaus to screen potential
borrowers.
   Creditors also have been referring delinquent debtors to
counseling, says Martin Neilson, a senior vice president at
Seattle-First National Bank and a member of ABA's bankruptcy task
force.
   Donald L. Badders, president of the non-profit National
Foundation for Consumer Credit, said 70 percent of those seeking
help from its 400 counseling offices can be prevented from filing
bankruptcy.
   The counselors act as intermediaries between debtors and
creditors, arranging small monthly repayments. Last year the
foundation recovered $242 million for businesses.
   Scott L. Shires, a Denver money manager, agrees that most
clients with money problems can avoid bankruptcy if they follow a
strict budget. But he says uncooperative creditors can unravel the
best-laid plans.
   That happened to Tom N., 41, who owned a truck-leasing business
in Denver until rapid expansion kept him behind in his bills.
   He said he reduced most of his $500,000 in debts after three
years, but two impatient creditors forced him into bankruptcy
court. He lost his business and his $250,000 home and was estranged
from his family.
   ``I grew too fast,'' he said. ``I didn't think it was greed. I
was grabbing the silver spoon and using other people to do it.''

   Here is a brief look at what to expect after deciding to file
for personal bankruptcy under Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 of federal
bankruptcy law, according to legal experts:
   _You must first fill out and file with a bankruptcy court in
your area a petition and several other forms detailing assets,
liabilities and living expenses. Those filing a Chapter 13 petition
must also include a debt-repayment plan in accordance with their
income and expenses.
   _The filing immediately stops your creditors from trying to
collect what you owe them, thereby temporarily preventing them from
garnishing your wages or seizing assets. But a landlord, for
instance, eventually may receive permission from the courts to
evict you.
   _If you've pledged property as collateral for a loan, you may
have to surrender the designated property to the creditor or make
arrangements to pay for it during or after bankruptcy.
   _Legal control of your financial problems is in the hands of the
bankruptcy court, which appoints a ``bankruptcy trustee,'' usually
an attorney or an accountant. Nothing can be sold or paid without
the court's consent.
   _Bankruptcy has no effect on some debts, including child
support, alimony, most taxes, and recent student loans.
   _Someone who co-signs a loan for you will receive the same
protection as you under a Chapter 13 petition but not under Chapter
7.
   _In Chapter 7 proceedings, a creditors meeting is called, after
which the trustee collects the property that can be taken from you
and sold to pay them. Depending on which state you live in, some of
your property can be exempt, such as household furnishings, jewelry
or clothing. The process takes three to six months to complete and
commonly requires one trip to the courthouse.
   _In Chapter 13, you must begin making payments to the trustee
under your debt-repayment plan within 30 days. Most of your debts
must be paid off in monthly installments within three to five
years, although your trustee could provide a grace period under
certain circumstances.
   _You can change your mind after you file either petition and ask
the court to dismiss your case. Also, if for some reason you can't
finish a Chapter 13 plan and your trustee won't modify your plan,
you can switch to a Chapter 7, provided you haven't completed such
a petition within the previous six years.
   _Your bankruptcy will remain on your credit reports for around
seven years.

   Here is a brief explanation of the five main chapters under
which bankruptcy petitions may be filed under the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code:
   _Chapter 7. Sometimes called ``straight bankruptcy.'' May be
used by businesses or individuals. A portion of the debtor's assets
is liquidated and distributed among creditors by a court-appointed
trustee to satisfy debts. In some cases action can be brought
against a debtor by creditors. Can't be filed more than once in six
years.
   _Chapter 9. Applies exclusively to municipalities. It was
enacted in response to the financial difficulties encountered by
New York City in the 1970s.
   _Chapter 11. Provides businesses or large investors with
protection from creditors while they continue operating and devise
ed by a federal
bankruptcy judge.
   _Chapter 12. Provides family farmers with court protection from
their creditors as they work out ways to repay their debts. These
cases are classified as business bankruptcies.
   _Chapter 13. Sometimes called the ``wage-earner plan.'' Provides
protection from creditors to individuals, including those who are
sole proprietors of a business, while they repay their debts from
current assets and income, usually over three to five years. Can be
filed at any time.

<HEAD>AIDS Brain Disorders, Less Common Than Once Feared, Still a Puzzle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five years after AIDS patients began to complain
of muddled thinking and the AIDS virus was found to be infecting
their brains, the condition known as AIDS dementia remains a puzzle.
   ``We still don't know why it happens,'' said Dr. Richard
Johnson, head of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine neurology
department. Until researchers do understand that, learning to treat
or prevent it will be difficult.
   The anti-AIDS drug AZT has been shown to reverse some of the
symptoms, but doctors have no specific treatment for the dementia
itself. Even the diagnosis can be tricky in the early stages, when
it can resemble depression or other kinds of dementia. As it
worsens, it reveals more characteristic symptoms.
   Some patients notice their handwriting is changing, said Alicia
Boccellari, director of neuropsychology at San Francisco General
Hospital. They complain of leg weakness _ the result of a
malfunction in the brain, not nerves of the leg.
   The AIDS virus attacks the sub-cortical areas of the brain,
which govern behavior and emotions. Apathy, irritability and a lack
of spontaneity result, accompanied in some patients by more
dramatic symptoms. ``These people will have an acute psychotic
state manifested by euphoria and hyperactivity,'' Boccellari said.
``They become very grandiose and delusional.''
   The virus doesn't generally affect the cortex, the seat of
language, however, so patients generally have little trouble with
speech. ``It can be misleading, because they seem so articulate,''
she said.
   As the dementia progresses, patients often complain less about
it. ``In the midstage of the dementia, they don't know they're
having any problems.
   ``This is due to the brain damage. It becomes difficult to
convince them they shouldn't be living independently, they
shouldn't be driving a car.''
   Researchers disagree over how many AIDS patients will develop
dementia and exactly when in the course of AIDS it can strike.
   Dr. Justin McArthur, a Johns Hopkins neurologist and the leader
of a National Institutes of Health study on AIDS dementia estimates
that 20 percent of patients with full-blown AIDS will have the
dementia.
   Dr. Richard Price, a neurologist at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Institute in New York, believes two-thirds of those patients
will have it.
   Both believe serious symptoms of dementia are uncommon early in
the AIDS infection. Some researchers claim, however, to find subtle
signs early.
   In 1987, Igor Grant, J. Hamp Atkinson and colleagues at the
University of California, San Diego, reported minor
neuropsychological problems in 44 percent of a group of generally
healthy homosexual men infected with the AIDS virus.
   The disagreement between Atkinson's group and McArthur's could
reflect differences in the tests they used. Atkinson believes
McArthur's tests weren't sensitive enough; McArthur thinks
Atkinson's were too sensitive.
   Other unsettled questions involve how the AIDS virus gets into
the brain, and precisely what it does when it gets there.
   The virus enters the brain soon after infection, studies show,
but can sit quietly for years before causing problems. It could
enter through the blood, or by way of the cerebrospinal fluid that
bathes the brain and spinal cord.
   The blood notion arose when scientists discovered similarities
between the AIDS virus and visna virus, which causes a
dementia-like illness in sheep and enters sheep brains in white
blood cells called macrophages. In this so-called Trojan Horse
theory, dangerous invaders hide in a harmless-looking blood cell.
   Most of the damage seems to occur in the so-called white matter
of the brain, bundles of nerve cell axons that carry electrical
messages. Infection is centered in certain brain cells called glial
cells, which serve as a ``glue.''
   The damage appears to be temporary, however. Destroyed brain
cells can't grow back, and AZT reverses some symptoms of dementia,
indicating that ``there is not a considerable loss of nerve
cells,'' said Michael B.A. Oldstone of the Scripps Clinic in La
Jolla, California.
   The distinction between damage and destruction is important, but
hasn't helped researchers figure out what's causing the dementia.
   Some scientists believe infected macrophages that enter the
brain spill out some unknown toxin, the result of an AIDS-triggered
malfunction. Another notion is that the virus doesn't damage the
brain directly, but produces proteins that are toxic to the brain.
   A final, intriguing idea has become the most controversial.
   Candace Pert, a former National Institute of Mental Health
pharmacologist who has set up her own AIDS research foundation,
believes that a protein called gp120 in the AIDS virus's outer
membrane, or ``skin,'' is a potent toxin that blocks the action of
a chemical essential for nerve cell growth.
   The growth chemical, vasoactive intestinal peptide, or VIP, is
similar to gp120. The substances share a tiny string of five
building blocks called amino acids. Pert believes that string is
the chemical ``key'' that the virus uses to enter glial cells.
   When VIP binds with glial cells, it triggers the production of a
growth factor that nerve cells need, she said. When gp120 binds
with the glial cells, the cells cannot produce growth factor. The
result is dementia.
   Pert attributes controversy over her theory to its radical
nature. ``It's a breakthrough in the field. It's so revolutionary
it has met with incredulity.''
   ``I think she's on to something,'' said Boccellari.
   ``I think it's a very, very intriguing idea,'' said McArthur,
but ``at this stage it's still that _ an idea.'' What Pert must
show, he said, is that the virus produces a lot of gp120 in the
brain.
   Pert tested her theory by giving patients a synthesized version
of the five amino acids. This drug, ``peptide T,'' was meant to
stick to glial cells in a way that would let them function and keep
gp120 out. Peptide T alleviated some of the dementia, providing
partial confirmation of her theory, she said.
   Her strongest critic is William Haseltine of the Dana Farber
Cancer Institute in Boston, who has studied peptide T and concluded
it has no beneficial effects. The disagreement remains unresolved.
   The importance of AIDS dementia has been so strongly emphasized
that McArthur worries that concerned, overzealous doctors may be
finding it in patients who don't have it. ``Other things can look
like it,'' he said. And some of them, unlike AIDS dementia, may be
curable.
   ``Recently we had a patient who came to us with symptoms of
dementia,'' he said. ``It turned out he was simply taking an
anti-depressant medication, and the levels of the anti-depressant
were too high.'' When the drug was stopped, the dementia
disappeared.
   In cases of true AIDS dementia, researchers don't expect such
easy answers. ``One of the problems is we don't really have animals
to work with that have something similar,'' said Price. ``It's
going to be a slow process. ... I haven't seen any breakthrough.''

<HEAD>Computer Will Let Navy Divers Go Deeper, Stay Down Longer</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL KACZOR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Computers like those in new car
engines will help Navy divers swim deeper and stay down longer
without telltale bubbles.
   Experimental diving gear incorporating a microprocessor is under
development at the Naval Coastal Systems Center and should be ready
for use by early 1993, said Steve Gorin, project manager for what
is dubbed the EX-19.
   A diver using ordinary gear can stay down 100 feet for about a
half-hour. ``With this system ... we can get in excess of six hours
at in excess of 300 feet,'' said Tony Ramey, head of the center's
Diving Systems Branch.
   Just how much in excess the Navy won't say.
   Workers at the center have been told not to disclose specific
uses for the EX-19, although they could say it will be the first
equipment used by all three types of Navy divers: fleet, explosive
ordnance disposal and special warfare.
   With regular scuba gear, known as an open system, a diver
breathes air from a tank and exhales it into the water, creating
the bubbles. Most of the air is wasted as the body consumes only a
small portion of the oxygen in each breath.
   The deeper a diver goes, the more air is wasted and the harder
it is to beathe with an open system because air becomes denser. The
diver has to breathe more air to get the same amount of oxygen and
suck harder to get the dense air.
   The EX-19 is a closed, or rebreather, system that recycles air
instead of letting it escape into the water, Gorin said. It uses
two tanks, one with pure oxygen and the other with ordinary air or
with a helium and oxygen mixture for depths greater than 150 feet.
   A scrubber removes carbon dioxide from the used air and
additional oxygen is injected as needed before it is breathed again
through oversized hoses. The diver breathes as he normally would on
the surface, Gorin said.
   The Navy already uses rebreathers and at least one is available
commercially, but the EX-19 advances the concept by using the
microprocessor to control the recycling operation and handle other
data. The diver wears a liquid crystal display unit on one wrist to
read depth and tank pressure.
   If something goes wrong, ``idiot lights'' like those on the
dashboard of a car flash inside the face mask and an alarm,
attached behind an ear, goes off.
   Members of the development team are civilians but many,
including Bill Gavin _ lead mechanical engineer and a
record-setting cave diver _ and Gorin, have had Navy dive training
that lets them participate in testing.
   ``It's really strange to get into it because it makes no
noise,'' Gorin said.
   Gavin, also a frequent user of open system gear, said he had
developed habits he didn't know he had until he tried out the
EX-19. ``When you get into a rig like this you have to almost
reteach yourself. Your ingrained training says you should breathe a
certain way ... and you don't have to do that.''
   Scuba divers can fill their lungs, increasing their boyancy, to
stop a descent or hover, or can exhale to sink, but those tricks
don't work with a closed system. ``When you inhale you are simply
transferring volume out of this rig and into your lungs and your
net boyancy doesn't change,'' Gavin said.
   Open-system bubbles can scare fish away, but they're less
frightened of the rebreather, Gavin said. For that reason and its
other advantages, rebreathers are used by some research scientists,
but their civilian application is limited by cost. A commercial
unit goes for more than $20,000, and Gorin estimated the production
version of the EX-19 will cost about $30,000.

   She's been called the ``Chicken Feed
Queen'' by schoolmates and doubted by scientists, but Alice Havens
remains undeterred in her quest to help millions of egg-loving
Americans.
   Every day around 5 a.m., the 17-year-old high school student
slips out of bed and into a pair of boots by the kitchen door, then
heads for her backyard, where she feeds 25 hens a special formula
to cut the cholesterol in eggs.
   Cholesterol-lowering research also is going on in laboratories
where researchers with advanced degrees and heavy funding measure
results with fancy instruments. Havens' experiment started out as a
project for the science fair.
   Sitting at the kitchen table, she opens a notebook to the typed
pages that detail her research. She says the charts show that the
special feed has dropped the cholesterol count 22 to 27 percent,
and that it's going down even further.
   Some scientists are skeptical, questioning her testing methods
and results. Dr. Edward Naber, who's been doing egg experiments for
30 years at Ohio State University, doesn't think her numbers are
significant.
   Havens, who has applied for a patent, is pushing on. Her words
get stronger, her pace quicker, when asked to respond to skeptics:
``Well, that's your opinion and I've got mine, and just because of
what you said isn't going to make me stop.''
   The Havens family lives in a big wooden house tucked deep in the
woods in Sherman, with two horses, a collie, two cats and Alice's
25 chickens.
   Science has occupied her since seventh grade, when the
papier-mache volcanoes she made with her best friend, Hannah
Roberts, won a prize at the Science Horizons fair in Danbury. ``We
built all these volcanoes, and we had a backdrop and everything,
with moss and paint, and it was a huge mess.''
   Inspired by her teacher, John Halloran, she kept entering the
fair, studying vision in horses one year, chicken feed in another.
In early tests, she gave her hens different diets, like sunflower
seeds and oyster shells; she started testing for cholesterol when
she entered New Milford High School.
   ``What I did was I tested different things on the hens, things
farmers sometimes fed, to see if the cholesterol level would change
in any way.''
   She hit pay dirt with the third diet, an ingredient she decided
to try _ and won't disclose _ because a friend of her sister had a
lot. Before, the hens laid jumbo eggs with 388 milligrams of
cholesterol; after, it was 340.
   Havens says the level has dropped even more, but she won't
release the figures until the next phase of the experiment is over.
She's also trying to pinpoint exactly what in the feed is working.
   Many researchers have tried to cut eggs' cholesterol but failed
to find a safe, cheap diet, said Naber, a food science professor.
He questioned Havens' figures, and said a large Connecticut egg has
202 milligrams of cholesterol and the national average is 213.
   Havens sticks by her guns, saying she started out with bigger
eggs and hasn't relied on U.S. Department of Agriculture standards
as a benchmark. She's also egged on, so to speak, by the accolades
she's won in the last two years.
   At the kitchen table, she flips through a scrapbook to
certificates and letters from the American Heart Association and
the Nutmeg Institute of Food Technologists, and mementos like an
luggage tag from her trip to Knoxville, Tenn., for the
International Science Fair. Her booty includes an encyclopedia set,
five shares of stock from United Technologies Corp., a leather
briefcase, five trophies on her bedroom dresser, four framed
certificates on the wall above her bed, and enough cash to pay for
the experiment.
   Last summer, Havens went to London for a science symposium with
800 students from around the world. She presented her research,
made friends, toured castles _ and intiated a walkout at one
session when a boy from Ireland made disparaging remarks about Vice
President Dan Quayle. She was reprimanded for taking 400 students
with her when she left in disgust.
   She's also learned to handle the kidding she gets from some
schoolmates. ``When I first started my sophomore year, I got a lot
of ribbing for it,'' but now that she's onto something big, ``it
doesn't bother me anymore.''

   Tiny detectors using off-the-shelf
parts and cheap 9-volt batteries can do a better job of spotting
intruders at military bases than the Vietnam War-era sensors that
weigh 140 pounds use $170 batteries.
   The miniaturized system, using eight seismic detectors the size
of cigarette packs, a portable monitor, two infrared detectors and
a beacon, is already being used by the Army, Air Force and Marine
Corps, said Dori Miller, supervisor of the sensor systems division
at Sandia National Laboratories.
   ``They're not the whole answer, but they do give you a first
alert _ where to look and when to look...,'' Miller said. ``A
Marine gets tired, gets hungry, may have to go to the men's room,
and sensors don't do that.''
   The seismic detectors are buried around a perimeter with only
their antennas above ground and transmit codes to the hand-held
monitor. The infrared detectors can signal a break in an infrared
beam, and the beacon sends a status report on the whole system
every 10 minutes. The system is remote-controlled.
   Depending on the setting, the seismic units can pick out
``anything from personnel to tanks,'' Miller said. The system costs
less than $3,000, compared with the $12,000 to $15,000 for the
older detectors that were used.
   Sandia researchers also are working on a magnetic detector and
one that would be able to detect a warm body, she said.

   Tang's fine, but astronauts may want
something to put on their cereal so researchers are trying to find
a way to store milk in space.
   ``NASA has decided that dairy products are necessary for
long-term space habitation,'' but needed a product that could be
stored without refrigeration, said Paul Savello, an assistant
professor of nutrition and food sciences.
   When the space agency approached Utah State University, its
Center for Dairy Food Technology had an answer:
ultrahigh-temperature sterilization, which shoots steam through
milk or passes milk over a hot plate to kill bacteria.
   UHT milk products can be stored warm on shelves for years,
although they taste better if they're cooled before serving,
Savello said. Researchers also are working on yogurt, custard,
cheesecake and citrus-flavored milk drinks.
   If NASA comes up with a pouch that can withstand the needed
heat, a pouch of milk will be on a December shuttle flight, he said.
   The steam method works instantaneously by shooting steam into
the milk at about 285 degrees, holding it at that temperature for
four seconds, then using vacuum to withdraw the excess moisture
from the steam. Using large, hot metal plates takes longer but
doesn't require the extra step of removing steam.

   Convenience foods' popularity shows no sign of
waning, so the trick is to make them better. A packaging method
developed in France shows promise despite some worries about its
safety.
   Sous-vide, French for ``under vacuum'' and pronounced
``soo'-veed,'' promises delicious and nutritious food for just the
effort of heating water.
   Sous-vide foods are enticing because taste is preserved _ food
is spared the extreme cold of freezing and the extreme heat used in
canning.
   Fresh raw ingredients are sealed in a plastic pouch and the air
removed. The pouch is then cooked and immediately refrigerated. The
consumer has only to reheat and open the pouch. Many chefs say they
cannot taste the difference between fresh-cooked foods and
sous-vide.
   ``In France, it really was quite wonderful. Especially the fish
I remember tasting quite marvelous. All the aromas are kept inside,
and the moisture,'' said Paula Wolfert, a New York cookbook writer.
   But while the process has been successful in Europe, its
advantages are also what raise concerns.
   The Food and Drug Administration recently warned that sous-vide
foods are ``fraught with danger'' because the oxygen-free
atmosphere provides a breeding ground for bacteria that can cause
food poisoning. Freezing and boiling inhibit or kill bacteria, and
refrigerated foods such as dairy products become rancid before they
become dangerous, the FDA said.
   ``Putrid smell is God's early warning system that food has
turned rotten,'' said Tom Schwarz, assistant director for program
development of the FDA's food protection branch.
   The agency said sous-vide cooking can kill microorganisms that
would provide a smelly warning but leave dangerous bacteria
unharmed. To prevent problems, sous-vide foods must be kept
continually refrigerated, leaving open the possibility of problems
during distribution and storage.
   ``It was designed for use in restaurants for people who wanted
to have sauces ready to go. It was not designed for a distribution
system,'' said Theron Downs, a professor of packaging at Michigan
State University.
   ``Sous-vide should not be practiced by anyone other than
registered thermal process establishments, where they know there
are food scientists, not just cooks or somebody in the back room of
a delicatessen.''
   David Shick, executive vice president and co-founder of Culinary
Brands Inc. of Sausalito, Calif., one of the few U.S. companies
specializing in sous-vide, expects it to become common in
supermarkets. ``A real consumer education has to go on, about pouch
products and the goodness and wholesomeness of pouch products,'' he
said.
   Wolfert sees promise in sous-vide to feed schoolchildren and the
poor. ``There's so many things that could be done with sous-vide if
they stop trying to make this gourmet. If we would just make
sous-vide of earthy foods, cheap foods.''
   Culinary Brands ships several dozen dishes _ with a 21-day shelf
life _ to restaurants, hotels and delicatessens. It lets
restaurants that don't have high-priced chefs serve foods like rack

   The House has voted overwhelmingly to raise
the hourly minimum wage from $3.35 to $4.25 by April 1991 and
create a new, lower wage for teen-agers with less than six months
of work experience.
   The 382-37 vote Wednesday on a compromise struck between
President Bush and congressional Democrats sends the measure to the
Senate, where leaders have promised to pass it before Thanksgiving.
   Bush's signature then would trigger the first increase in the
minimum wage since January 1981. The compromise provides a 45-cent
increase to $3.80 next April 1 and another 45-cent jump a year
later.

<HEAD>Consumer Confidence Stable In October, Survey Indicates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer confidence remained stable in October
despite sharp gyrations in the stock market, the Conference Board
reports.
   A monthly survey conducted for the business-financed research
group indicated consumers were positive in their assessments of
business conditions during October and in their expectations for
coming months.
   The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence index registered
116.4 in October, compared with 116.3 in the previous month and
with a 1985 base of 100, the group said Wednesday.
   Among those responding to the survey of 5,000 households, 28.2
percent said business conditions were ``good,'' compared with 27.1
percent in September, while those characterizing business
conditions as ``bad'' was flat at 16.9 percent.
   Some 30.4 percent said jobs were plentiful, unchanged from in
September, while 20.2 percent said jobs were hard to get, compared
with 20.7 percent the month before.
   Expectations about the next six months also were largely
unchanged, the Conference Board said, with 20 percent believing
business conditions would improve compared with 8 percent believing
they would deteriorate.
   Fabian Linden, executive director of the Conference Board's
Consumer Research Center, said the stock market's late October
decline, and the 190-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average
on Oct. 13, apparently had little effect on confidence.
   ``Survey returns received after the drop in the Dow Jones
average were about the same as the views expressed prior to that
event,'' he said.
   Buying plans were mixed. Some 6.7 percent of respondents
indicated they planned to buy automobiles in the next six months,
compared with 8.1 percent in September, while 3.3 percent said they
would buy a home during that time, compared with 3.1 percent in
September.

<HEAD>Treasury To Sell $40 Billion In New Bonds, Notes In Quarterly Auction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Treasury Department said it plans to
borrow $40 billion from the public in the next two weeks in a
series of debt auctions being held to replenish the government's
depleted coffers.
   But officials said Wednesday the auctions are contingent on
passage by Congress of a bill to raise the federal debt limit. The
government's borrowing authority dropped Tuesday midnight to $2.80
trillion from $2.87 trillion.
   The House has voted to raise the debt ceiling to $3.1 trillion
for the current fiscal year, but Senate legislation has been
blocked by a squabble over whether to cut the capital gains tax.
   Michal Basham, deputy assistant Treasury secretary for finance,
told reporters Wednesday they auctions probably would have to be
postponed if the legislation is not approved early next week.
   According to Wednesday's announcement, the auctions for next
week would including:
   _$10 billion in three-year notes in minimum denominations of
$5,000 to be auctioned on Tuesday.
   _$10 billion in 10-year notes in minimum denominations of $1,000
to be auctioned next Wednesday.
   _$10 billion in 30-year bonds in minimum denominations of $1,000
to be auctioned next Thursday.
   These notes and bonds are regularly sold during the large debt
auctions which are held four times a year.
   In addition, for this series of debt auctions the government
said it would sell $10 billion in 36-day cash management bills
which would mature on Dec. 21. These bills will be sold in minimum
denominations of $1 million.

<HEAD>Bush Announces Tariff Reductions for Andean Nations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush has unveiled a package of trade
initiatives to help create ``economic alternatives to drug
trafficking'' for the Andean nations of South America.
   The initiative grew out of a promise Bush made to Colombian
President Virgilio Barco at a Sept. 28 meeting to expand economic
trade as part of the war on drugs.
   The White House said Wednesday the initiatives will include
expanding the list of agricultural and industrial products from the
Andean nations allowed into the United States duty-free. It gave no
specifics.
   The White House said Bush was proposing bilateral and regional
initiatives to bolster trade with Colombia, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador
and Venezuela.
   ``I believe that through increased trade we can make a
contribution to the creation of economic alternatives to drug
trafficking,'' Bush said in a statement. ``Healthy economies are
the only lasting solution for eliminating the drug trade and
substituting legitimate trade.''
   Bush said, ``We are prepared to do all that we can to enhance
the benefits the countries of the region enjoy under our
Generalized System of Preferences,'' including an immediate review
``to consider the addition of new products, both agricultural and
industrial, to the program.''
   Those preferences provide breaks on tariffs for developing
nations.
   Bush said the United States was also prepared to ``explore
possibilities for expanding textiles trade,'' and giving technical
trade assistance to the Andean nations.
   He said the United States is committed to ``build on the
political consensus to negotiate a new International Coffee
Agreement that corrects the fundamental problems with the previous
agreement.''
   Coffee prices have plunged, much to the distress of Colombia and
other major coffee-producers, since the United States quit the last
agreement in July.
   The United States was upset with restrictions on sales of
certain types of coffee favored by American consumers and with
lower prices on coffee charged East bloc nations outside the
agreement.
   He also said the United States will seek to accelerate tariff
negotiations with participants in international trade
liberalization talks now underway in Geneva, and to support
multilateral development banks' efforts ``to promote meaningful
trade policy reforms in the Andean nations.''
   Bush said he also planned to consult with the major U.S. trading
partners, including Canada, Japan and the European Community, on
ways to help the Andean nations.
   ``Our goal must be to help create an environment where
entrepreneurship can flourish and comparative advantages can be
successfully pursued in competitive world markets,'' the president
said.

<HEAD>Fed Survey: Economic Growth Varies from Slow to Moderate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's economic growth continued to vary
from slow to moderate early this fall, the Federal Reserve said in
a survey that did not mention any inflationary problems.
   ``Consumer spending is mixed, with a number of districts
describing retail sales as steady to growing slowly,'' the survey
summary said Wednesday. ``Manufacturing activity is also mixed,
with some districts reporting weakenss in orders and shipments.
   ``Weakness of construction in some markets contrasts with
evidence of some improvement elsewhere. Resource industries,
including the energy sector, appear to be improving, as is
agriculture generally,'' it continued.
   The survey by the 12 district banks is compiled by the Fed every
six weeks to prepare for meetings of the Federal Open Market
Committee, the Fed's monetary policy-setting arm. The next meeting
is Nov. 14.
   Recent economic indicators show sluggish economic growth
following Fed moves to ease inflationary pressures by tightening
credit. As inflation appeared to abate this summer, the central
bank has eased its grip.
   The latest survey was prepared at the Fed's Kansas City bank
based on information obtained before Oct. 10.
   Seven of the 12 districts mentioned prices. They were
``generally stable'' in Boston, while ``moving up but at a
slackening pace'' in Philadelphia.
   Cleveland expects ``very little moderation in inflation''
through the end of the year, while Richmond reports a slower rise
in input prices. Respondents in the Atlanta district ``reported
only modest wage or price pressures.''
   In the Kansas City district, ``retail prices and prices of
manufacturers' inputs have changed little in recent months,'' while
``wage and price increases remain modest'' in the San Francisco
district.
   In the retail area, the srvey found that ``sales of apparel,
basic housewares and other nondurables are described as relatively
strong. Sales are weaker for discretionary, big-ticket items such
as furniture, home appliances and consumer electronics; auto sales
have also been weakening recently.''
   Manufacturing activity was described as slowing in the
Philadelphia, Chicago and Cleveland districts; varied in Richmond
and St. Louis, and improving in Boston, Dallas and San Francisco.
   Signs of weakness in residential construction appeared in St.
Louis, Kansas City and Atlanta. Dallas reported little change,
while Chicago reported receiving mixed reports. Richmond reported
stronger demand for mortgage loans.
   Nonresidential construction was reported to be weak in Atlanta
and St. Louis, holding up well in Chicago and improving in Dallas,
New York and San Francisco.
   The San Francisco district reported that most businesses in its
area ``have resumed operations since the earthquake, but road
closures and property damage are delaying a complete return to
busienss as usual.''
   The Richmond district said many of the usual South Carolina
participants in its survey did not respond because of Hurricane
Hugo. But it said the hurricane had little effect on the industrial
base of either of the Carolinas.
   Hugo, however, ``severely affected the agriculture sectors of
North and South Carolina, bringing extensive damage to crops and
structures as well as considerable destruction of livestock and
poultry. Total damage to the farm sector in both states has been
estimated at nearly $1.2 billion.''

   Consumers have more protection under existing
food pesticide laws than they would under changes proposed last
week by President Bush, a consumer lawyer told a Senate panel.
   ``We're better off with current law if we're going to have to
sacrifice the basic health nature of the statute,'' Janet S.
Hathaway of the Natural Resources Defense Council said Wednesday at
Labor and Human Resources Committee hearing.
   She called the Bush plan a ``cynical effort'' that
``fundamentally erodes the basic health-protective standard in the
food safety law'' by letting the government weigh the benefits of a
hazardous pesticide when deciding whether to cancel or suspend it.
   Her organization was joined by Public Citizen and Consumer's
Union in criticizing the Bush proposal to raise the acceptable
cancer risk level to one in 100,000. Critics say a risk level of
one in 1 million, the standard used last year by the Environmental
Protection Agency, should be applied.
   Although the proposals would result in swifter cancellation and
more suspension of especially dangerous pesticides, critics
questioned whether the EPA would have the political courage to
enforce a law that allows a risk-benefit calculation.
   Further, they said the plan fails to address ``aggregate risks''
_ the total risk when the entire diet of a person is considered,
not just a single pesticide in one food. Also, safety legislation
needs to consider the risk to special populations, such as children
and pregnant woment, they said.
   Legislation by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the
committee, would address those issues.
   Representatives of the agricultural chemical industry and farm
groups criticized both the Bush and Kennedy proposals, although
they backed Bush's risk-benefit formula.
   They said the standard in the Kennedy bill would amount to a
``zero risk'' because of its numerical formula of one in 1 million,
but they said the Bush definition of an ``imminent hazard'' would
be subject to inconsistent applications.
   ``Not only do pesticides help ensure the availability and
affordability of agricultural products, but they are often
necessary to ensure the safety and nutritional value of many
commodities,'' said Marlyn Jorgensen, president of the American
Soybean Association.
   ``The health benefits offered by pesticides to the American
consumer cannot be overlooked,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   President Bush has added Hungary to a list of
nations whose imports can receive duty-free treatment in a further
effort to boost that nation's emerging open-market economy.
   The action Wednesday came a few days after Bush lifted 15 years
of trade sanctions against the Soviet-bloc nation by restoring
most-favored-nation status.
   Hungary recently declared itself a democracy, and Bush praised
it for riding the crest of the way of political reform sweeping
eastern Europe.
   Wednesday's action adds Hungary to countries that are part of
the General System of Preferences. Usually extended to developing
or poorer nations, this system allows a wide array of products to
be imported into the United States duty-free.
   The exact products are to be determined later. In general terms,
imports given such privileged treatment only lose it if they become
direct threats to identical U.S.-manufactured items.

   U.S. savings bonds will earn interest at a
rate of 6.98 percent over the next six months, down from the 7.81
percent rate prevailing over the last six months, the Treasury
Department said.
   However, the department had to suspend new sales indefinitely
Tuesday because of congressional failure to enact legislation
raising the federal debt limit.
   ``Without new legislation to increase the debt limit, the
government lacks authority to issue any new debt obligations,'' the
Treasury said in a statement Wednesday.
   The government's borrowing authority dropped at midnight Tuesday
from $2.87 trillion to $2.80 trillion.
   The House has voted to raise the debt ceiling to $3.1 trillion
for the current fiscal year, but Senate legislation has been
blocked by a squabble over whether to cut the capital gains tax.
   When savings bonds go back on sale, those issued during the
remainder of November will earn interest from the first of the
month, the department said. Payroll savings plans will continue to
operate normally, except that bonds that would have been issued
during the current suspension will be issued when the suspension is
lifted.
   The new savings bond rate ``reflects market activity during the
past six months and keeps savings bonds in the mainstream of
financial products for the coming semiannual rate period,'' said
Jerrold B. Speers, executive director of the Savings Bond Division.
   Savings bonds' interest rates are changed each May 1 and Nov. 1
to reflect open market rates. They are based on 85 percent of the
yield on five-year Treasury securities, which have averaged 8.21
percent over the last six months.
   Savings bond yields at redemption are the average of semiannual
market-based rates during the time held, compounded semiannually,
or a minimum rate, whichever is greater. The current minimum rate
is 6 percent.
   Since market rates for bonds were introduced, the rates have
ranged from a high of 10.94 percent for the six months beginning in
November 1984 to a low of 5.84 percent for the six months beginning
in May 1987.
   In addition to savings bonds, the department suspended the sale
of special securities for state and local governments, the
temporary investment vehicles for money those governments raise in
the bond market.
   If the securities are not available, state and local governments
could be forced to cancel planned bond sales, leading to disruption
of the municipal bond market.

<HEAD>Rear-Seat Belt Requirement Being Extended to Light Trucks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal requirement that cars have rear-seat
shoulder and lap safety belts will be extended to light trucks and
convertibles, Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said.
   Skinner also said Wednesday his department will extend to light
trucks and ``multi-purpose passenger vehicles,'' such as vans and
four-wheel-drive utility vehicles, the existing roof
crush-resistance standards for passenger cars.
   The new requirements will be made final after a 60-day public
comment period.
   ``Light trucks are being used more and more to transport people
instead of property,'' Skinner said in a statement. ``These new
rules will help ensure that occupants are adequately protected,
particularly in rollovers.''
   Spokesmen for the Big Three auto manufactuters said they already
were meeting one or both of the proposed standards or would by the
1992 model year, when the rules are to take effect. They would
apply to cars made after Sept. 1, 1991.
   The department's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
acknowledged in a statement that most light truck manufacturers are
voluntarily meeting the level of roof crush resistance required for
passenger cars. But the agency said extending the standard would
ensure ``total compliance'' by current and future manufacturers.
   Under the proposed roof crush rule, roofs would have to
withstand a force of 1{ times the unloaded weight of the vehicle.
During a test, a vehicle's roof could not be depressed more than
five inches.
   The rule would apply to multi-purpose passenger vehicles and
trucks with a gross vehicle weight rating of 10,000 pounds or less.
   Skinner announced the regulatory changes in a speech to the
National Safety Council in Chicago.

   The Japanese government has urged caution by
companies considering purchases of U.S. corporations and
properties, but the suggestion appears to be having little
influence.
   Mitsubishi Estate's purchase of a majority stake in Rockefeller
Group Inc. _ owner of New York's famed Rockefeller Center _ on the
heels of Sony Corp.'s $3.4 billion buyout of Columbia Pictures
Entertainment Inc. has heightened concern in the United States over
Japanese control of U.S. assets.
   Japanese companies and government officials are acutely aware of
the controversy and public relations officers are working overtime.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe expressed concern this
week about a possible American backlash and suggested that
businesses weighing U.S. investments could ``come up and ask our
opinion.''
   But analysts say government influence over such decisions is
waning.
   ``Clearly there is no grand national coordination. It would be
in the (Japanese) national interest if everyone cooled it for a
while, but who wants to be the first to hold back?'' says Japanese
business expert James Abegglen.
   As individual firms charge ahead, business associations are
working to reduce ``investment friction.''
   The Council for Better Corporate Citizenship, led by Sony
Chairman Akio Morita, disseminates information on how to
participate in community activities and avoid racism and sexism to
smooth relations in overseas subsidiaries.
   Industry analysts say some major real estate firms are avoiding
buying landmark U.S. buildings because of the attention they
attract. Companies in many industries are increasingly sensitive to
public relations. Japanese executives of American subsidiaries of
Mitsui Real Estate Development Co., one of the most aggressive
Japanese developers in the United States, are active in raising
money for the United Way.
   Tokyo analysts were surprised that a conservative company like
Mitsubishi would risk possible negative reaction to a high-profile
deal involving Rockefeller Center, especially so soon after the
Sony-Columbia deal.
   But some suggested the company may believe its conservative
image and prestigious name would reassure critics that it had
Rockefeller Center's best interests at heart.
   It was the Rockefeller Group that was eager to conclude the deal
and wanted Mitsubishi to take a majority stake, even though the
Japanese firm wanted to proceed at a slower pace, said Mitsubishi
spokesman James Rudy.
   The Rockefeller Group also approached Mitsui Real Estate, Nippon
Life Insurance Co. and several other firms about investing before
Mitsubishi concluded the deal, said spokesmen for the Japanese
firms. Although the companies declined to comment on their reasons
for not pursuing the deal, several major newspapers reported they
were concerned about possible backlash.
   The Japanese press gives heavy coverage to American reaction to
Japanese business activities.
   Immediately after the announcement of the Mitsubishi deal,
Japanese camera crews were on the streets of New York interviewing
Americans for their reaction. Japanese news organizations phoned
American correspondents in Tokyo to ask what ``nuance'' they were
giving their stories.
   When the Sony-Columbia deal was featured on the cover of
Newsweek, it was picked up by local media and prompted criticism of
American ``overreaction.''
   ``We cannot help feeling that some (American reactions) are
overly emotional,'' commented the national newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
Outspoken lawmaker Shintaro Ishihara blames American ``racism'' in
part.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Watanabe noted after the Mitsubishi
deal that similar purchases by British and Dutch investors did not
raise the same unease among Americans.
   But at the same time they criticize American reactions, many
Japanese businessmen and government officials are acutely aware of
and even sympathetic to American sentiments about Japanese
investment.
   ``It is important that Japanese corporations act in
consideration of these feelings,'' the Asahi Shimbun said after the
Sony-Columbia deal.
   The paper said one reason for American resentment is that
``while Japanese firms can take over U.S. firms easily, the reverse
is not true.'' It suggested the situation should be changed.
   Some Japanese are surprised there is not stronger reaction
against foreign buyouts. The reaction to Mitsubishi's purchase
among New Yorkers appeared to be largely positive. Mayor Edward
Koch welcomed the deal.
   Japanese national television broadcast comments from New Yorkers
on the street saying, ``It's a good thing _ we need the
investment,'' ``It's a free country,'' and ``It's your money _ you
can do what you want with it.''
   On hearing these comments, one Japanese newscaster shook his
head in disbelief.
   ``Would we say the same thing if a Korean or a Hong Kong
conglomerate came and bought up a piece of Marunouchi (the prime
business district in Tokyo owned by Mitsubishi)?'' he asked.

<HEAD>Purchasing Managers' Survey Indicates Manufacturing Sector Remains
Soft</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA C. MARTINEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. economy continued to slow in the third quarter as the
manufacturing sector weakened for the sixth straight month,
according to new reports from the nation's purchasing managers and
the Commerce Department.
   Analysts said the data provides further evidence that the
economy's growth has softened since an unexpectedly brisk summer
and could remain sluggish in the months ahead.
   The Purchasing Manager's Index, a widely watched economic
barometer, rose to 47.6 percent in October from 46 percent in
September and 45.2 percent in August, the group said Wednesday.
   A reading below 50 percent indicates the manufacturing sector of
the economy is in decline while a reading above 50 percent
indicates growth, according to the association.
   It was the sixth straight decline in manufacturing but the
second consecutive month where the rate of decline was less than in
the previous month, said the National Association of Purchasing
Management.
   A huge increase in defense orders helped boost U.S. factory
orders in September, the government said in a separate report
Wednesday, although without defense contracts such orders actually
declined, while construction spending remained flat during that
month.
   ``This confirms what is essentially a weak economy,'' said
Lawrence A. Veit, an economist with the investment firm Brown
Brothers Harriman &amp; Co.
   A survey by the Federal Reserve of the nation's economic growth
largely reinforced the other data. Results of the six-week survey
concluded that the economy is growing at a slow to moderate pace
with manufacturing and construction weak in some sections of the
country, consumer spending mixed and resource industries, including
energy and agriculture, improving.
   The monthly purchasing managers report is based on a survey of
purchasing executives in more than 250 industrial companies. The
index is a composite of responses regarding six separate
indicators, including new orders, production, vendor deliveries,
inventories, prices and employment.
   The Commerce Department, meanwhile, said orders for durable and
nondurable manufactured goods totaled a seasonally adjusted $236.7
billion. Excluding the jump in defense orders, orders actually
declined 2.1 percent.
   In a separate report, the department said construction spending
was unchanged in September after surging by 1.5 percent in August.
Residential, non-residential and government construction spending
totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $415.6 billion in
September.
   Spending spurted in August because of a strong 5.3 percent
increase in government building and a 2.9 percent gain in
non-residential construction.
   Contributing to the decline in the October purchasing managers
survey was a steep drop in the export orders growth rate. While
export orders remained relatively brisk last month, the index fell
to 55.5 percent from 60.5 percent.
   ``If you keep short-term interest rates high eventually they
will affect exports,'' said Thomas F. Carpenter, an economist with
ASB Capital Management.
   The manufacturing and housing sectors of the economy have been
hit hardest by high interest rates as the Federal Reserve tightened
credit in an effort to slow inflation.
   However, the survey also indicated a sharp turnaround in new
orders growth after a four-month decline. Robert J. Bretz, chairman
of the association's Business Survey Committee, said the reversal
``hints of a possible continued easing in the overall future rate
of decline in the manufacturing economy.''
   New orders is one of six variables considered in the purchasing
managers' survey. The new orders index rose to 51.4 percent from
45.4 percent in September.
   Nevertheless, while U.S. manufacturing is sluggish, some
economists said the purchasing manager's survey has overstated the
weakness.
   ``All this says is that the manufacturing sector is weaker than
the economy as a whole,'' said Giulio Martini, an economist with
Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. Inc.
   ``Fundamentally the manufacturing sector is strong,'' Carpenter
said. ``You just need a drop in interest rates of about a half
percentage point and we wiil start to see a release of the pent-up
demand pressures that have been building.''
   Indexes for vendor deliveries, production, prices and employment
all declined, according to the survey.
   The seasonally adjusted indexes for the six separate indicators
represent the net change between those reporting positive, negative
and similar responses from the previous month.

   For restaurant owner Jesus Tavera, a
higher minumum wage means a higher-priced menu.
   For Shirlee Lora, a single mother of two, getting more than
$3.35 an hour means means more food and clothes for her children.
   For grocery store owner Bill Engelbrecht, a higher minimum wage
wouldn't mean much because he can't get anyone to work for the
current minimum anyway.
   Those were some of the impressions Wednesday in the nation's
heartland after the U.S. House voted 382-37 for an increase in the
minimum wage from $3.35 per hour to $4.25 per hour.
   Under the bill, the minimum would go to $3.80 per hour April 1
and to $4.25 per hour one year later. The measure now goes to the
Senate, where leaders said they hoped to put it on President Bush's
desk before Thanksgiving.
   ``If I have to pay more, I have to raise my prices,'' said
Tavera, who opened Restaurante Guadalajara three months ago in
Kansas City's West Side.
   Tavera said he thought it wasn't a bad idea to raise the
minimum, but it would cause across-the-board inflation.
   ``If I have somebody who cooks for $4.50 an hour and the minimum
(becomes) $4.25, she's going to ask me for $5.50,'' Tavera said.
   Ms. Lora, 26, made $3.35 per hour when she started at a Midtown
Winchell's Donut House. She now makes $4.25 _ the proposed new
minimum _ and she says there's a big difference.
   ``There's more to buy for my two kids. ... You can basically
save more. There's no way you can save on the (current) minimum,''
she said, adding that an increase ``is long overdue.''
   If approved, the minimum-wage hike would be the first since 1981.
   But many employers said the market had already rendered the
$3.35-per-hour rate obsolete.
   Engelbrecht, manager of a large grocery store next to Truman
High School in Independence, said he couldn't hire help for $3.35.
   ``I'm next door to a high school. I mean right next door, and I
can't get help. They walk on by,'' he said.
   He said grocery baggers start at $3.90 per hour now, and by the
time the new minimums would phase in, the sackers likely will be
making more.
   ``It makes the politicians look good, but they haven't done
anybody any favors,'' Engelbrecht said. ``The private sector is
ahead of the government.''
   Richard Diehl, who manages a Burger King near downtown, said he
also couldn't pay minimum wage, although many will work for a few
cents more an hour.
   ``Even in the most depressed areas, it affects their mentalities
to take the minimum wage,'' Diehl said. ``They won't take a
minimum-wage job.''
   He said the $4.25 minimum would cost his restaurant roughly
$8,000 more a year.
   ``That wouldn't devastate us,'' he said, adding that many
employers already were planning on a federally mandated increase.
   Other fast-food managers said only the youngest, least
experienced start at the current minimum. In Johnson County, Kan.,
an affluent suburb west of Kansas City, many youngsters start at
more than $4 per hour now, managers said.
   Manuel Rayes, publisher of the bilingual Dos Mundos newspaper,
said the measure would help Hispanic citizens _ perhaps at the
expense of undocumented workers.
   ``These people are going to come out of their homes and look for
jobs. And maybe they'll take jobs that the illegals would have
had,'' Rayes said.
   ``The illegal ones will come here and work for anything they
can,'' Rayes added. ``It's not that they're taking jobs away. They
are taking jobs that nobody wants.''

<HEAD>House Passage Sends Minimum Wage Compromise to Senate</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also on general news wires.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate leaders are promising to pass the first
raise in the minimum wage in nearly a decade before Thanksgiving
following a lopsided House vote for the compromise increase.
   The House voted 382-37 on Wednesday to raise the minimum wage
from $3.35 _ its level since January 1981 _ to $3.80 next April 1
and $4.25 a year later.
   A vote in the Senate, where the measure has overwhelming
support, has not been scheduled but could come as early as next
week. Senate passage would send the measure to President Bush,
whose compromise with Congress Tuesday ends an eight-year political
fight between congressional Democrats and two Republican
administrations.
   Senate Democratic Leader George Mitchell of Maine called the
compromise ``a victory for working Americans, those at the bottom
of the economic scale, who need a boost and need it as soon as
possible.''
   House Democrats who had failed in years past to raise the
minimum wage said their victory was tempered by an increase smaller
than they had passed earlier this year and by the new subminimum
wage for teen-agers new to the job market.
   ``This vote represents only a partial victory for low-wage
workers,'' Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., said after the House
endorsed the compromise. ``However, something is better than
nothing. ... We should never again allow a decade to elapse with no
action.''
   The lower minimum could be paid to workers from 16 to 19 years
old for their first three months of work experience. It could be
extended for three more months for youths in certified training
programs.
   The lower wage would be 85 percent of the prevailing minimum
wage except for in the first year of the increase, when it would be
barred from being below the current $3.35 an hour minimum. The
subminimum would be $3.61 when the minimum wage rose to $4.25.
   The provision allowing the lower wage expires in April 1993.
   The government says some 4 million Americans work at the minimum
wage. Congressional researchers say two-thirds of them are women
and between 25 percent and 33 percent are heads of households.
   Eleven states have laws mandating minimum wages higher than the
current federal floor; a few of them already are at the $4.25 level.
   Despite the lopsided vote, lawmakers from both parties found
fault with the compromise.
   Democrats complained the increase was too small and the
subminimum created a dangerous two-tiered wage system. Some
conservative Republicans opposed any increase and said Congress was
intruding on business costs.
   But the fierce partisanship that characterized the fight over a
bill Bush vetoed last summer was absent.
   ``We could have let politics override our effort to reach an
agreement on minimum wage,'' said Rep. Thomas Ridge, R-Pa., who had
urged the White House to drop its refusal to compromise. ``That
political debate is behind us.''
   Voting for the compromise were 247 Democrats and 135
Republicans. Two Democrats who support a higher minimum wage, Carl
Perkins of Kentucky and George Miller of California, voted no
because they oppose the subminimum. Thirty-five Republicans voted
against the measure.
   To strike the deal, Democrats agreed to push back the effective
dates of the increases from January to April, accept the subminimum
wage and drop their insistence on a commission to make annual
recommendations on the wage level, a mechanism Republicans said
would have been used to seek annual increases.
   Bush, in what the administration insisted until Friday was his
``first, best and final offer,'' earlier this year offered an
increase to $4.25 and a six-month lower minimum for new workers
regardless of previous experience. He agreed to the increase nine
months earlier than he had proposed and accepted a far more
restrictive subminimum wage.

<TEXT>
   The Los Angeles Herald Examiner, once the
nation's largest afternoon newspaper, published its last edition
today, announcing its bittersweet farewell with the headline ``So
Long, L.A.''
   Virtually every columnist and many of the 86-year-old
newspaper's reporters confessed in print to giving way to tears
while composing the edition.
   ``They tore a part of my heart out yesterday,'' sports columnist
Doug Krikorian declared on a sports page whose headline asserted
``We're outta here!''
   Humor columnist Gordon Dillow found himself without a joke.
   ``Tough, hard-bitten journalists aren't supposed to cry,'' he
lamented. ``And yet ... when the announcement came that this would
be the last edition of this newspaper, dozens of tough, hard-bitten
reporters and editors who have spent years dealing with death and
destruction and calamity on a daily basis stood around with tears
welling up in their eyes.''
   Hearst Corp. attributed the closing to losses of up to $2
million a month and a lack of suitable buyers since the paper was
offered for sale last summer.
   The announcement of the closing, which leaves the nation's
second-largest city with just one daily paper, came Wednesday from
Robert Danzig, general manager of Hearst Newspapers, who spoke from
atop the newsroom's copy desk.
   ``Although operating at a financial deficit for more than two
decades, there was never a deficit in the quality and the vigor of
its editorial commitment to the people of Los Angeles,'' he said.
``It has been a losing business, but a winning newspaper.''
   The paper's 831 employees will receive 60 days' severance pay
and help in looking for work; longtime staffers will get
additional, unspecified benefits.
   Founded by William Randolph Hearst in 1903 as the Los Angeles
Examiner, the newspaper was under intense pressure in recent years
from the Los Angeles Times, the region's dominant daily with five
times the Herald's daily circulation.
   ``It's a sad day for journalism and a sad day for Los Angeles,''
said Shelby Coffey III, editor of the Times.
   The cessation of publication shook many Herald staffers even
though they already were inured by repeated speculation about the
paper's demise.
   ``Of course it's a tragedy,'' said freelance writer Rip Rense, a
Herald Examiner reporter from 1979 to 1983. ``For all the ups and
downs and the flaws of the Herald in the last 10 years it was still
always a very lively read with occasional excellent journalism,
consistently in the sports section.''
   Herald editorial staffers found themselves inundated by
inquiries by other newspapers. The suburban Orange County Register
set up an ad-hoc recruiting table at Corky's, a favorite drinking
spot across the street from the Herald's landmark Spanish-style
building.
   ``We don't want to be ghoulish about it, but there are lots of
good people who work here,'' said John Hollon, a Register assistant
managing editor.
   But even as writers, press operators and drivers contemplated
their future, the staff attempted to fulfill Editor Maxwell
McCrohon's exhortation that everyone ``put out a hell of a last
edition.''
   ``This paper has been more than a job, it's been a cause for a
lot of people, to keep a viable Number 2 in Los Angeles,'' Andy
Furillo, a seven-year employee, said after finishing the main news
story on his employer's passing.
   Although it lacked the salaries, staff and resources of its main
competitor, the Herald earned respect for its coverage of City
Hall, sports and entertainment.
   The Herald's circulation peaked in 1967 at 729,000. For the six
months that ended March 31, its average daily circulation was
238,392 and 183,122 Sunday.
   That compared with the Times' 1,119,840 daily and 1,423,310
Sunday, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations.
   McCrohon also attributed the paper's circulation fall to a long,
bitter strike. On Dec. 15, 1967, members of the Los Angeles
Newspaper Guild launched the sometimes violent 10-year strike,
which was never technically settled.
   The Herald switched to morning publication in 1981. Besides the
Times, the paper had to wrestle with increasingly successful
suburban papers like the Register, based in Santa Ana, and the Los
Angeles Daily News, based in the San Fernando Valley.
   By the time it converted to mornings, ``the game was over,''
said John Morton, a newspaper analyst at the Washington, D.C.,
brokerage firm Lynch, Jones &amp; Ryan.
   ``The Herald Examiner is a classic example of a newspaper that
suffered for many years by being in the afternoon position.''
   Twenty-three newspapers in major U.S. cities have closed since
1950, Morton said.
   Other major daily newspapers that closed during the 1980s
included the Miami News, the Baltimore News American, the Memphis
(Tenn.) Press-Scimitar, the Cleveland Press and the Washington Star.

<HEAD>Fujitsu Tries To Withdraw Another One-Yen Bid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KOZO MIZOGUCHI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Just days after Fujitsu Ltd. failed in its attempt
to escape a contract for which it bid 1 yen, or about 0.7 of a U.S.
cent, the Japanese computer giant said it was trying to withdraw
from another 1-yen deal it says lacks ``common sense.''
   Akira Imagawa, a spokesman at Fujitsu's headquarters in Tokyo,
said Wednesday that company officials in the Nagano prefecture in
central Japan had asked local authorities to cancel a contract the
company won last month with a 1-yen bid.
   Both cases have attracted the attention of Japan's Fair Trade
Commission, whose officials say they are considering an
investigation into whether the unusually low bids constitute unfair
trade under the Anti-Monopoly Law.
   In the Nagano deal, Fujitu and electronics giant NEC Corp. made
identical 1-yen bids for a contract to design software for the
prefectural libary's computer system, local officials said.
   The prefectural government had set aside 16 million yen, or
about $112,000, in its budget for the project, the officials said
on condition of anonymity.
   ``Front-line salesmen desperately wanted to win the contract ...
but lacked common sense,'' Imagawa said.
   In the earlier case, Fujitsu officials said their 1-yen bid to
design software to map the Hiroshima city water supply system
represented a long-term investment. But later they appeared to
change their minds and asked the city to cancel the contract. The
city had budgeted $78,000 for the project.
   City officials refused, although they said their decision would
depend on the outcome of a possible Fair Trade Commission
investigation.
   ``We will continue to seek the city's understanding to retract
the contract,'' Fujitsu's Imagawa said.
   Meanwhile, officials of the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry cautioned Fujitsu on Tuesday about business practices that
were ``beyond common sense,'' said an official of the ministry's
Electronics Policy Division.
   The official, who spoke anonymously, said the ministry also
urged major member companies in the Japan Electronics Industry
Development Associaton, a industrial grouping of computer and
electronics makers, ``not to make discount sales at irrational
prices.''
   Companies competing for both the Hiroshima and the Nagano
contracts reportedly saw the projects as a way to get a head start
on computer systems expected to be linked up throughout the country.
   But Makoto Sakata, a noted commentator, said the cases also
demonstrated that corporate ethics lag behind generally accepted
rules of behavior, with companies emphasizing their relations with
local officials rather than profitability.
   ``Looking at what Japan's leading high-technology companies like
Fujitsu and NEC are doing, It's painfully clear that modernaization
of Japanese corporations is superficial and that they in fact
remain unchanged from the feudal age,'' Sakata said.

<UNK>Germany's Suedzucker AG To Acquire Belgian Sugar Refinery</UNK>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The majority owner of Tiense
Suikerraffinaderij NV said Thursday it will sell the company's
sugar refining operations to the largest sugar refiner in West
Germany for about 39 billion francs, or $1 billion.
   The deal will make Suedzucker AG of Mannheim the largest sugar
producer in Europe, solidifying its position before Europe melds
into one market in 1992. The company, which controls 40 percent of
the West German sugar market, is now the European Community's
third-largest sugar maker behind Italy's Ferruzzi SpA and Tate and
Lyle PLC of Great Britain.
   R.T. Holding SA, which owns 75 percent of the Belgian sugar
concern, said an agreement with Suedzucker was signed on Wednesday
based on a share price of 2,985 francs, or $76.53.
   Tiense Suikerffaffinaderij's shares closed at $70 Tuesday. There
was no trading Wednesday, the All Saints public holiday, and
trading in the Belgian sugar company was suspended Thursday.
   Sugar refining is Tiense Suikerraffinaderij's major business.
The company reported 1988 profits of $69.2 million on revenues of
$641 million.
   Suedzucker reported annual sales of $1.17 billion in 1988. A
cooperative of sugar farmers owns 60 of the concern; Deutsche Bank
has a 20-percent stake.
   R.T. Holding said its Dutch parent, R.T. Holding-Nederland, will
buy the non-refining assets of Tiense Suikerraffinaderij, including
biotechnological research, agro-industry and food processing
companies.
   Negotiations to sell the Belgian sugar refinery to Suedzucker
began in October, but rumors of a deal had been widespread for some
time.
   The company's shares began to rally last spring amid talk that
the Wittouck family, which controls R.T. Holding, was negotiating
to sale.
   Tiense Suikerraffinaderij is based in Tienen, east of Brussels.

<HEAD>Securities Commission Fines Drexel's Spanish Unit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Securities Commission Thursday
recommended the Spanish unit of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. be
fined the maximum amount for fraudulent trading practices.
   The watchdog agency recommended the Economy Ministry fine DBL
Capital Markets Espana SA 65 million pesetas _ or $556,725 _ or
five times the amount of the operation's gross profits, which is
the maximum fine under law.
   The Spanish branch of the U.S. securities firm was liquidated in
June.
   The commission said its investigation ``sufficiently proved''
the trading company had committed ``a very serious infraction''
during the partial privatization of shares of the state-controled
Repsol oil group last May.
   The Spanish investigation, made public last June, was an
embarrassment to Drexel, which earlier this year had pleaded guilty
to six U.S. felonies brought under a U.S. insider trading probe and
agreed to pay more than $650 million to settle criminal securities
charges.
   The commission also said it had turned over evidence to a local
court to determine whether the infraction also constituted criminal
fraud.
   Drexel's Spanish unit allegedly created false clients through
unauthorized use of names of Spaniards in order to secure the
maximum number of shares allowed to brokers for resale. Instead,
Drexel sold the shares to just 17 foreign institutional investors,
the investigation showed.
   Last July, Drexel's chief executive officer said the firm had
ordered its 27-employee Spanish unit closed down after the
announcement of the investigation, which the firm described as
``improper behavior.''
   Under Spanish law, the Spanish unit's parent company is legally
responsible for the fine since the unit has been liquidated.

   The stock market turned downward today as
traders awaited the latest reading on the state of the economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 10.24 to
2,635.66 in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 375 up, 524 down and
524 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 19.56 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The Labor Department is due to report Friday morning on the
employment situation for October.
   Advance estimates call for the figures to show a relatively
modest increase in nonfarm payroll employment, reinforcing recent
evidence of slowing economic growth. That would presumably give the

   American workers made significant productivity
gains in the third quarter, the government said today in a report
that nonetheless underscored the economy's slower growth and
manufacturing's slump.
   Overall productivity in the non-farm sector of the economy rose
at an annual rate of 2.1 percent in the third quarter, nearly
double the revised second-quarter gain of 1.1 percent, the Labor
Department said.
   That overall gain bodes well for the economy at a time of tight
labor markets and a reluctance of some employers to hire new
workers because of concern about future economic growth. Improved
productivity is an important means of keeping U.S. businesses
competitive and offsetting possible inflationary pressures caused
by wage gains.
   But the report also provided fresh evidence that the
manufacturing sector is struggling and faces continued pressures
that hurt its ability to compete abroad.
   The overall improvement came as output rose at an annual,
seasonally adjusted rate of 3.1 percent while hours worked climbed
just 1 percent.
   That third-quarter increase in hours was the lowest in more than
three years, further evidence that the growth rate of the economy
has slowed.
   The slowdown was even more evident in manufacturing, where
productivity rose at an annual rate of just 1.4 percent, down
sharply from the revised second-quarter improvement of 3.7 percent.
   The third-quarter gain in manufacturing was the smallest since
the fourth quarter of 1987. Output in manufacturing increased just
1.3 percent at an annual rate in the last three months _ the
smallest gain since 1986 _ and hours worked in the sector declined
0.1 percent at an annual rate after falling a revised 0.2 percent
in the second quarter.
   The data show that wage gains by workers were smaller in the
third quarter than in the second but that workers actually got more
buying power out of their paychecks in the July-September period
because the wage gains outpaced consumer inflation after trailing
the price increases in the prior three months.
   Overall, hourly compensation rose at an annual rate of 5.3
percent in the non-farm sector, down from the second quarter
annual-rate gain of 5.6 percent. But when inflation is factored in,
the compensation rose at an annual rate of 2.9 percent in the third
quarter, the largest gain in two years, after falling 0.7 percent
in the April-June period.
   Because of the 2.1 percent productivity gain, unit labor costs
increased at an annual rate of 3.2 percent in the third quarter
despite the significant compensation increase. Unit labor costs had
increased at a revised 4.5 percent in the second quarter.
   But in manufacturing, the slump and rising wages caused a
significant increase in unit labor costs.
   The Labor Department said those costs rose at a rapid 4.5
percent annual rate in the third quarter after falling at a revised
annual rate of 1.0 percent in the second quarter. That was the
largest quarterly increase in unit labor costs in the manufacturing
sector since a 9.7 percent annual gain was reported in the first
quarter of 1982 _ during the last recession.
   Continued higher costs to produce goods in manufacturing would
only add to the sector's slump; if U.S. manufacturers are forced to
raise prices it would make it even more difficult for them to
compete in foreign markets.
   Another gauge of productivity that includes agriculture showed
that productivity improved at an annual rate of 1.2 percent in the
third quarter, with output up at an annual rate of 3.0 percent and
hours worked up 1.7 percent. That gain was down from the revised
1.6 percent annual-rate gain in that sector in the second quarter.

   Zenith Data Systems, which has already
supplied many of the personal computers in use at the Defense
Department, has won a five-year contract to provide support
services for those machines.
   Company officials of Zenith Electronics Corp.'s computer
products subsidiary said Wednesday the contract should result in
more than $534 million in revenues over seven years.
   Under the terms of the contract, Zenith Data Systems will supply
advanced peripherals and software, plus training and maintenance
services for the Personal computers the company has supplied to the
Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, Defense Logistics Agency and
other defense organizations.
   The government has the option of receiving maintenance, training
and support services from Zenith for an additional two years beyond
the five-year span of the contract, officials said.
   Zenith announced last month that it is selling its computer
business to Groupe Bull of France, subject to stockholder approval.

<HEAD>Downey Says Problems In Securities Industry Not Pervasive</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The securities industry needs to work harder to
safeguard the marketplace and address program trading and index
arbitrage, strategies accusedc of causing wide swings in the stock
market, the newly nominated chairman of the Securities Industry
Association said today.
   ``Our organization needs to sit down and do something about it.
We need to look at the pros and cons,'' said Robert N. Downey,
partner with Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. and a former member of the
Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board.
   Downey, 53, was named to succeed Hardwick Simmons as 1990
chairman of the trade group, which represents more than 625
securities brokerages and investment banking firms in the United
States and Canada.
   The SIA board will vote on the nomination at its annual meeting
on Nov. 29 in Florida.
   In recent days, several major Wall Street brokerages have said
they will curb program trading that critics claim is dangerously
distorting the stock market and scaring away small investors.
   In program trading, millions of shares of stocks are traded
almost instantaneously by computerized systems used mainly by huge
institutional investors such as banks, mutual funds and pension
funds.
   ``Our policy has to be to address'' controversial strategies,
Downey said.
   However, he said many of the problems facing the industry have
been overstated.
   ``We've had these outside factors and we have insider trading
scandals and things of that nature that maybe involve just a few
people, but they are magnified and thought to be pervasive, but
they're not,'' Downey said.
   Also nominated to the SIA board were John L. Steffens, president
and chief executive of of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith
Inc., as vice chairman; Richard B. Fisher, president of Morgan
Stanley Group Inc. and Addison L. Piper, chairman fo chief
executive of Piper, Jaffray &amp; Hopwood, both renominated as vice
chairmen.
   Simmons, vice chairman of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., will
continue to serve as an officer and director of SIA.

<TEXT>
   The commissioner of the Food and Drug
Administration criticized a new American Heart Association ``seal
of approval'' program as regulation for profit.
   Frank E. Young, commenting Wednesday before an FDA public
hearing on food labeling, joined the U.S. Agriculture Department in
disapproving of the idea.
   The association proposes to issue the seal to companies
beginning in February for a fee of up to $40,000 per product if
they meet low-sodium, low-cholesterol guidelines.
   ``We're deeply concerned about a for-profit regulatory
approach,'' Young said.
   He said that the determination of what can be put on food labels
is a government responsibility and that the plan might lead to
``competing and misleading information.''
   However, heart association spokeswoman Debra Garner said the
program is not for profit.
   The fees, ranging from $10,000 to $40,000, would cover the cost
of advertising the program, distributing brochures in supermarkets
and product testing, she said. The fee would depend on the size of
the company and its market share.
   The USDA sent the association a letter critical of the program
as it pertains to meat or poultry, which the Agriculture Department
oversees. The FDA has jurisdiction over other food products.
   The USDA said the labeling would lead consumers to believe that
foods that don't have the association's seal would be less
desirable.
   Ms. Garner said the plan doesn't need government approval.
   The heart association says the program aims to educate consumers
and help them eat healthier.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Gain In Early Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices rose slightly in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade amid concern
about the Brazilian soybean crop and expectations for new export
business.
   A survey released Wednesday of Brazilian soybean growers showed
just 2 percent of the crop planted compared to an average of 11
percent for the same date in recent years.
   Brazil is the world's second-largest soybean producer after the
United States. Analysts say economic troubles are forcing South
American farmers to reduce their plantings of both soybeans and
corn.
   Indications of new export business supported the soybean and
wheat markets. News of Soviet interest in buying U.S. meat has
spurred speculation that the Soviet Union may increase its imports
of other commodites, too.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 1 cent to 2{ cents higher
with the contract for delivery in December at $3.99 a bushel; corn
futures were } cent to 3 cents higher with December at $2.40{ a
bushel; oats were 1\ cents to 1} cents higher with December at
$1.44} a bushel; soybeans were 1} cents to 5 cents higher with
November at $5.64{ a bushel.
   Pork-belly futures surged in early trading on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, extending a three-day rally linked to Eastern
European demand for U.S. meat. Cattle futures were mostly lower.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .17 cent lower with December at
74.27 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .20 cent lower
with November at 82.92 cents a pound; hogs were .07 cent to .25
cent higher with December at 47.90 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .78 cent to 1.80 cents higher with February at 59
cents a pound.
   Pork futures advanced sharply on Wednesday while cattle futures
retreated.

<TEXT>
   Japanese investors snapped up another piece of
America, joining with a Dallas group to buy a high-rise office
complex in Houston's most expensive real estate deal.
   Taikichiro Mori, one of Japan's most famous developers, said
Wednesday the group he heads will pay about $300 million for 85
percent of the Four Oaks Place Development in partnership with the
Lehndorff USA Group of Cos.
   Interfin Corp. will retain a 15 percent stake in the 18.5-acre
project.
   The four office buildings are in Houston's Galleria area, a
financial and residential high-rise district.
   News of the deal came two days after another Japanese company,
Mitsubishi Estate Co., announced it was buying controlling interest
in Rockefeller Center, a New York landmark, for $846 million.
   ``The people who have been the last to take a long, hard look at
Houston have been the Japanese,'' said Marilee Wood, spokeswoman
for Interfin Corp., developer of Four Oaks.
   Ms. Wood said while other investors have begun returning to the
Houston marketplace in recent months, buying offices, apartments
and industrial buildings, the Japanese have shied away from new
deals in the once-beleaguered oil city.
   She said the deal indicates the city is on the recovery path.
   The last big purchase by Japanese investors in Houston was in
December, when Shintech bought a prime block of downtown real
estate from Campeau Corp. for about $7.3 million. The land was
being used as a parking lot.

   Compaq Computer Corp.'s stock plunged nearly 15
percent today after the company announced fourth-quarter earnings
will be below expectations.
   Shortly before 11 a.m. EST, Compaq was off $15.37{ at $90.62{ in
heavy New York Stock Exchange trading. In the last year, the stock
traded as high as $112.50 a share and dipped as low as $52.
   ``October sales came in about 10 percent below our expectations,
leading us to believe that the results of our fourth quarter would
not meet analysts' expectations,'' Compact Chief Executive Rod
Canion said today. ``Sales for the full fourth quarter, however,
are still expected to grow 15-20 percent over the previous year.
   ``And, as a result of the normal, tightly controlled financial
environment in which the company is managed, we believe our overall
performance will be consistent with the company's long-range
objective of 8-to-10 percent profit after tax.''
   A week ago, Compaq stock tumbled 8 percent after the computer
maker disclosed it uncovered two minor flaws in the i486
microprocessor made by Intel Corp. The chip will be the brains of a
major new computer Compaq is introducing next week.
   Canion blamed lackluster sales on a slowing growth rate in the
American market, limited availability of new products and continued
uncertainty about the new i486 chip.
   Intel, which said the two flaws had been discovered by an
unidentified customer, said it would begin shipping a fixed version
of the chip by the end of this month.
   One flaw involves trigonometric functions and another involves a
feature that detects irregular operations, like attempting to
divide by zero. Both occur only under special conditions and would
not affect most users, the company said.
   Compaq also reported last week its earnings jumped 51 percent in
the third quarter, but part of the increase came from a gain in the
carrying value of its investment in a disk-drive maker Conner
Peripherals Inc. The earnings were at the low end of analysts'
expectations.

   Pacific Telecom Cable Inc. received
final federal approval to install the western end of the first
digital fiber-optic cable that will stretch directly from the
United States to Japan.
   Pacific Telecom Cable, a majority-owned subsidiary of Pacific
Telecom Inc., said Wednesday it received a final license from the
Federal Communications Commission. It had received a conditional
FCC license in April 1987.
   The license will enable the company to link Pacific City, Ore.
and Seward, Alaska with the international fiber-optic cable network
by the target date of December 1990, company President Dennis
Elliott said.
   The cable project is a joint venture between Pacific Telecom
Cable of the United States, International Digital Communications
Inc. of Japan and Cable and Wireless PLC of the United Kingdom.
Pacific Telecom owns the U.S. portion of the project.
   The 5,200-mile project is the largest fiber-optic cable network
authorized for the Pacific Ocean region and the first to provide
direct service between the United States and Japan, the company
said. Currently, telephone services are routed through Hawaii.
   The network will link the U.S. domestic digital network,
trans-Atlantic fiber optic cables, and fiber optic networks serving
Japan, Asia and the Pacific Rim.
   The cable can carry up to 85,000 telephone conversations
simultaneously on 17,010 circuits.
   The increase in capacity will allow users to place calls easier
and the digital fiber-optic materials will make the connections
clearer, said Stephen E. Lovas, Pacific Telecom Cable
vice-president of sales and marketing.
   The system will also provide the first digital fiber-optic link
between Alaska and the rest of the U.S. mainland through an
underwater branching unit 700 miles south of Seward. Currently,
analog satellite systems are used.

<HEAD>October Sales at Big Retailers: Mixed Bag</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The country's big retailers today reported mixed October sales
with results at some general merchandise stores hurt by consumers'
reluctance to spend freely on expensive goods, such as furniture or
home appliances.
   Clothing retailers fared better than major national chains that
depend heavily on sales of ``big-ticket'' durable goods.
   But in some parts of the country, particularly the Northeast,
unseasonably mild weather discouraged shopping for winter apparel.
   ``They were generally modest kinds of sales gains that continued
the basic trend of the past several months,'' said analyst Jeffrey
Feiner of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
   ``The department stores and some of the specialty retailers
outperformed the durable-goods dependent retailers, such as Sears
and K mart,'' Feiner said.
   Sears, Roebuck and Co., the largest U.S. retailer, said its
sales edged up 0.7 percent in the four weeks ended Oct. 28 to $2.53
billion from $2.51 billion a year earlier.
   But sales at Sears stores open at least a year, called
same-store or comparable-store sales, were flat.
   Retailers and analysts regard same-store sales as a better
reflection of a company's performance than tallies that include the
take at newly opened stores.
   Feiner said results for some of the retailers looked slightly
worse than they were because they were being compared with a strong
month last year.
   Analysts said it was difficult to generalize about last month's
retailing business because the results varied so widely. Economists
track retailers' results closely for clues about spending patterns;
consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of total U.S.
economic output.
   ``The numbers were really mixed, more so than we've seen in
previous months,'' said retail analyst Jeffrey Edelman of Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Within the apparel category alone there were variations.
Moderate to higher-priced clothing merchants posted fairly strong
results while apparel sales at discounters lagged, analysts said.
   The figures reported today by major general merchandise chains
and apparel retailers differ from the government's monthly retail
sales figures. The Commerce Department report is more comprehensive
and covers sales at auto dealers, supermarkets, restaurants and
elsewhere.
   Among some of retailers reporting were:
   _K mart Corp., the second-largest retailer, said its October
sales increased 5.3 percent to $2.07 billion from $1.97 billion in
October 1988. Its comparable-store sales were up 2.1 percent.
   _Third-ranked Wal-Mart Stores Inc. reported a 22 percent
increase in October sales to $2.19 billion from $1.79 billion.
Wal-Mart's same-stores sales grew 8 percent.
   _J.C. Penney Co. Inc. reported a 9.6 percent October sales gain
to $1.28 billion from $1.17 billion. Penney's same-store sales rose
8.2 percent.
   _Dayton Hudson Corp. reported October sales went up 16.2 percent
to $969 million from $834 million. Its same-store sales rose 8.5
percent.
   _Limited Inc., a leading specialty apparel retailer, said its
sales rose 9 percent to $334.9 million from $307.7 million. On a
comparable-store basis, Limited's sales were up 6 percent.

<HEAD>Brazil and Argentina Spearhead Drive Toward Latin American Common
Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TODD LEWAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brazil and Argentina, the ailing
giants of South America, are trying to salvage their crumbling
economies by starting a common market modeled after Europe and the
United States.
   The traditional rivals say cooperation is the only way for Latin
America to head off economic disaster.
   ``There aren't many options. Either we work out a joint strategy
in line with our development needs, or we will be the objects of
outside strategies,'' Argentine President Carlos Menem told
Brazil's Congress during a three-day visit in August.
   Burdened by stagnant growth, four-digit inflation and a combined
foreign debt of some $170 billion, Brazil and Argentina have
knocked down some trade barriers and recently agreed to boost trade
and cooperation to unprecedented levels.
   The idea is not new. In the last three decades, an array of
organizations _the Latin American Association of Free Commerce, the
Andean Pact, the Latin American Development Association and, most
recently, the Latin American Economic System _ were devised to
unite Latin American economies.
   All failed, mostly because of excessive protectionism,
nationalism and cultural antagonism.
   But this time around, Latin American leaders say they can lick
the problem by starting small.
   Tiny Uruguay, which borders the two giants, recently joined
Brazil and Argentina in the common market scheme. Now, these three
countries hope to attract other nations to the fold, or at least
set an example for other regional trade blocs.
   ``It's the only way for Latin America to create a common
market,'' said Helio Jaguaribe, director of research at Rio de
Janeiro's Institute of Political and Social Research. ``The
Brazil-Argentina accords have become a spotlight for other
countries to follow.''
   The renewed interest in a Latin common market was sparked by the
growth of trade alliances in Western Europe, between the United
States and Canada, and between Japan and its Asian neighbors,
analysts say.
   ``Integration is fundamental,'' Fernando Collor de Mello,
Brazil's leading presidential candidate, said recently. ``Latin
America cannot be left out of this new world order.''
   Increasingly, the region's leaders are dismantling or selling
off the powerful but often inefficient state-run enterprises and
turning to free market principles.
   The return of civilian regimes in much of Latin America also has
helped foster mutual trust and economic liberalism that was lacking
under military rule, when generals were more concerned with
``national security.''
   ``The old military governments hardly wanted to share their
secrets or strengths with their neighbors,'' said Paulo Rabello de
Castro, a private economic consultant in Rio and managing editor of
the respected financial monthly Conjutora Economica. He said that
mutual suspicion no longer exists.
   Indeed, Menem and Sarney recently signed agreements to swap
military, space and nuclear technology, and increase cultural
exchange programs.
   The growth of Latin American industry also will boost
integration, economists say.
   Nations such as Venezuela, Chile, Brazil and Argentina are no
longer as dependent on foreign technology as they were 30 years
ago. Today, they can trade a wide variety of products and resources
without foreign assistance.
   ``The integration gears are meshing,'' de Castro said. ``By
early next century a common market scheme could be in place
complete with a regional judiciary system.''
   But large hurdles remain.
   The current economic woes of Argentina and Brazil have left
those countries without the funds needed to support and finance a
continent-wide market, said economist Carlos Alberto Primo Braga, a
visiting professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced
International Studies.
   ``It's hard to achieve integration when the region's economies
are in recession,'' said economist Celso Furtado, a former
Brazilian planning minister. ``The last thing fragile, internal
industries will want is competition from other countries.''
   Many analysts say economic growth needed to foster a common
market will only start when the continent's $440 billion foreign
debt becomes less of a burden.
   Argentina is virtually bankrupt and $4.5 billion behind in
payments on its $60 billion foreign debt.
   Even Brazil, which boasts the world's eighth biggest economy and
the third largest trade surplus, spends most of its export earnings
to pay interest on its $110 billion foreign debt, the Third World's
largest.
   To ease the burden, Latin leaders are considering proposals to
swap foreign debt to create a Latin American common market fund,
according to Aloizio Mercadante Oliva, professor of economics at
Sao Paulo's Catholic University.
   Another obstacle is the lack of a strong local currency. The
value of Brazil's new cruzado drops daily, and Argentina's austral
has plummeted more than 97 percent against the U.S. dollar in the
last five months.
   ``We'd have a tough time trading even shoe laces with our funny
money,'' said Rabello de Castro.
   To cope with the ``funny money'' problem, Brazil and Argentina
have a $500 million reciprocal credit agreement under which they
import and export each others' products without the use of currency.
   Large trade imbalances between nations and a reluctance to loan
cash and share technology continue to impede integration, analysts
say.
   Indeed, since South America's two largest trading partners
announced their common market plans in 1985, Brazil has run up a
$500 million trade surplus with Argentina.
   But that too may be changing. Brazil in August agreed to accept
up to $350 million worth of Argentine-financed projects for
transportation, hospital construction and hydroelectric equipment.

<HEAD>Cowles Media to Sell Great Falls, Rapid City Newspapers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cowles Media Co. said Thursday it will sell
the Rapid City (S.D.) Journal and the Great Falls (Mont.) Tribune
and offer to purchase up to 250,000 shares of its own stock.
   David Cox, president and chief executive of Cowles Media, said
the moves would address strategic issues for the company.
   ``The cost of acquiring additional midsize market newspapers has
effectively precluded our growth in regional newspapers to
complement those in Great Falls and Rapid City,'' he said.
   ``In today's competitive environment, owning only two such
papers is not a viable strategic position, so we concluded that
selling them is our best option.''
   The company said it is offering to buy up to 250,000 shares of
its own stock, or about 10 percent of the total shares outstanding,
at a price of $200 a share. The offer, which includes voting and
non-voting shares, will be made to all Cowles Media shareholders
through an offering memorandum being mailed Thursday. The offer
will expire Jan. 5, 1990 unless extended.
   Cox said the company had previously determined that the purchase
of its own stock was a good investment.
   ``As a private company, the market for Cowles Media shares is
limited and, as a result, liquidity is important for some
shareholders. This offer will give all shareholders the opportunity
to sell some of their shares if they so desire.''
   About 60 percent of the voting stock of Cowles Media is held in
a voting trust for the benefit of members of the Cowles family. The
trustees of the voting trust have indicated they do not intend to
tender any shares of the voting stock held in the trust.
   The Rapid City Journal was purchased by Cowles Media in 1964 and
the Great Falls Tribune in 1965. The Journal has a daily
circulation of 34,368 and Sunday circulation of 36,472; the Tribune
has a daily circulation of 34,167 and 40,968 on Sunday.
   Other Cowles Media operating units include the Star Tribune of
Minneapolis; Sentinel Publishing Co. in the Denver area; Scottsdale
Progress in Arizona; Cowles Magazines of Harrisburg, Pa., a
magazine and book-publishing group; and Hanson Publishing Group
Inc., Stamford, Conn.

<HEAD>Ex-Ford Engineer Reaches Plea Agreement in Fraud Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Ford Motor Co. employee who allegedly
received $2.5 million in kickbacks from suppliers to a Ford plant
in suburban Cleveland entered a plea agreement Thursday with
federal prosecutors.
   Ludwig A. Schafer, 61, of Stow, Ohio, is expected to plead
guilty Nov. 14 to two counts of mail fraud before U.S. District
Judge Julian Cook Jr. in Detroit, Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen
Robinson said.
   The agreement called for Schafer to serve up to five years in
prison on the first count, followed by five years' probation on the
second count, Robinson said.
   Schafer also agreed to make a ``good faith effort'' to
compensate Ford for the $2.5 million in kickbacks he allegedly
received between 1976 and March 1989 while employed as a senior
materials handling engineer at the automaker's Walton Hills
Stamping Plant, Robinson said.
   Ludwig allegedly rigged bids from suppliers of racks and other
items used in shipping and materials handling, to ensure that
contracts would be awarded to companies agreeing to pay him
kickbacks.
   ``The `winning' bid was sufficiently inflated to ensure that the
supplier could pay the kickbacks and still make a profit,''
Robinson said. ``In several instances, Schafer agreed with the
owner or an employee of the supplier paying the kickbacks to share
the kickbacks with the owner or employee personally.''
   The two mail-fraud counts charged Schafer with mailing two Ford
checks totaling $98,367 to Empire Wood Products Inc. of Hudson,
Ohio. Empire and other companies accused of paying the kickbacks
remain under investigation, Robinson said.
   Under the plea agreement, Schafer agreed to transfer certain
property to Ford as part of restitution to the automaker. That
property included his Stow residence, a 46-foot power boat, an
Arizona townhouse; five acres of land in Clarion, Pa., and 1,000
shares of Ford stock.

   The stock market lapsed into a steady decline
today as traders awaited the latest reading on the state of the
economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 30.33 to
2,615.57 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 455 up, 996
down and 475 unchanged.
   The Labor Department is due to report Friday morning on the
employment situation for October.
   Advance estimates call for the figures to show a relatively
modest increase in nonfarm payroll employment, reinforcing recent
evidence of slowing economic growth. That would presumably give the
Federal Reserve extra leeway to relax its credit policy soon,
encouraging interest rates to fall.
   But brokers said investors were still worried about unexpectedly
weak earnings reports issued by many companies for the third
quarter.
   A good many Wall Streeters believe profits and dividends may
suffer further this winter, even if the economy is able to achieve
a ``soft landing'' rather than any severe slump.
   Uneasiness on that score was heightened today when Compaq
Computer projected lower fourth-quarter profits. Compaq shares
tumbled 18 to 88.
   Among other leading computer and technology issues, Computer
Associates International dropped ~ to 11|; International Business
Machines 2 to 96}; Hewlett-Packard 2 to 44{, and Microsoft 4| to
77{ in the over-the-counter market.
   UAL dropped 1 to 176 after trading briefly above 180 following
word late Wednesday that Reliance Group sought clearance to
increase its interest in the company to more than 15 percent.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
2.02 to 186.82. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value

<HEAD>Sale Set on Core Business But State Regulators Clamping Down</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Integrated Resources Inc. agreed Thursday to
sell its key businesses for up to $225 million but regulators in
Iowa and Colorado clamped down on two life insurance subsidiaries
in moves that could block the deal.
   The sale to Broad Inc., a Los Angeles-based financial services
company with $7 billion in assets that include the SunAmerica
insurance groups, is subject to price adjustments at the time of
closing. The deal would be worth $170 million if completed Thursday.
   The deal would cap Integrated's months of attempts to sell its
core businesses to raise money to help meet payments on about $1.75
billion in debt and avoid a bankruptcy court filing.
   State insurance officials said Thursday they had placed Des
Moines, Iowa-based Integrated Life Insurance Co. and Denver-based
Capitol Life Insurance Co. under supervision and required prior
approval for any sale.
   Iowa's insurance commissioner has advised Integrated that the
Broad sale does not meet regulators' approval and the state is
considering issuing an order to take over the assets and operations
of Integrated Life next week.
   Integrated said discussions were under way with the state and
Broad to restructure the sale to meet the insurance commissioners'
unspecified demands.
   Colorado's Insurance Division on Wednesday required Capitol Life
to obtain state approval before taking any actions outside the
normal course of business, such as selling assets, merging with
another company or investing funds.
   Chad Collier, the division's chief of financial affairs, said
the state had received calls and letters from Capitol Life
policy-holders concerned about the company's fate.
   ``It's making their policy-holders real nervous and I can
understand why,'' he said. ``We would not want the parent company's
problems solved by taking assets out of its subsidiary. ...We want
to see the company sold to another solid buyer.''
   The planned sale to Broad also includes Integrated Resources
Asset Management Corp., an investment adviser; Integrated Resources
Equity Corp., which recently was transferred to two company
executives and renamed; and Resources Trust Co.
   Under terms of the deal, Broad can call off the sale within 30
days after Integrated provides financial and other information.
Until then, Integrated is free to seek other offers for the
businesses and will pay Broad $3 million if the deal falls through.
   The sale price is far below the $450 million Integrated had
hoped to obtain several months ago for its core financial
businesses.
   In an effort to stanch a sales force exodus, Integrated last
month transfered its main broker-dealer subsidiary to two
executives and changed its name from Integrated Resources Equity
Corp. to Royal Alliance Associates Inc. Integrated in June
defaulted on nearly $1 billion of its roughly $1.75 billion in
total debt. Integrated has not paid any principle or interest to
bondholders since then.
   The company's problems stem from difficulties in diversifying
out of real estate into financial services.
   Broad Inc.'s life insurers are Sun Life of America, Anchor
National and First SunAmerica. The company's financial services
group includes broker-dealers Anchor Financial and SunAmerica
Securities.

<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastman Kodak Co. said Thursday its
earnings declined 25 percent in the third quarter, the third
consecutive decline this year.
   Kodak Chairman and Chief Executive Colby H. Chandler blamed the
continued slide on higher operating costs and no improvement in
productivity, despite record sales for the quarter.
   ``Everything had very sluggish qualities to it, although
individual businesses performed well,'' said financial analyst Mark
Obenzinger of Trinity Trading Co. in New York.
   In another adverse development for Kodak, the International
Union of Electrical Workers has said it is planning a drive at
Kodak, which has long staved off organization attempts by offering
workers generous bonuses and benefits.
   IUE organizers have been working on Kodak for the past four to
six weeks and have distributed thousands of leaflets at the plant
in the past week, said union organizer Edward E. Young.
   The company announced earnings of $329 million, or $1.02 per
share, for the quarter ended Oct. 1, compared to $435 million, or
$1.35 per share, in the same quarter last year. The company
reported record sales of $5.11 billion for the third quarter, up 2
percent from last year's record $5.03 billion.
   Earnings fell 23 percent in the first quarter and then 85
percent in the second quarter, when they were depressed by the
expenses of a streamlining program. Analysts said it is too early
for the effects of the restructuring to show up in the company's
earnings.
   Kodak said its results will be depressed again in the fourth
quarter by costs of a restructuring program announced in August.
The company announced plans for 3,500 job cuts _ about 3 percent of
the company's worldwide employment _ wage freezes, the sale or
consolidation of many of its businesses, and other cost-cutting
measures.
   ``The productivity issue and rates of return on the business are
being addressed aggressively by action under the company's recovery
plan, which is on target,'' Chandler said.
   Net earnings for the first three quarters of 1989 were $589
million, or $1.82 a share, down 46 percent from $1.09 billion, or
$3.35 a share, in the first three quarters of 1988. Those earnings
were reduced by $227 million in restructuring costs recognized in
the second quarter. Sales for the first three quarters of 1989 rose
8 percent to $13.5 billion from $12.5 billion a year earlier.
   The company said operating earnings on overseas sales were
reduced by foreign currency rate changes, but those changes were
offset by marginally higher prices.

<HEAD>Cray Founder Formalizes Split With Founder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cray Research Inc. has formalized its split
with Seymour Cray, the company's founder who is designing the
supercomputers once considered its key hope for the early 1990s.
   Having already pumped $106 million into his Cray-3, Cray
Research said Wednesday its $98.6 million contribution to spinoff
firm Cray Computer Corp. hinges on Seymour Cray's continued
affiliation with the new supercomputer company.
   Gary Smaby, an analyst who follows Cray Research for the
Minneapolis-based Smaby Group, said, ``The most revealing
disclosure is that the deal is off if Seymour leaves the firm or
dies.''
   Cray, 64, is to be chairman and a computer developer for Cray
Computer, a 241-employee firm based in Colorado Springs. The
spinoff is to occur Nov. 15 through a distribution of stock to
existing stockholders of Minneapolis-based Cray Research.
   Like Cray Research, Cray Computer will develop high-speed
scientific computers known as supercomputers. Its machines will
sell for $15 million to $30 million each.
   The disclosure of Seymour Cray's financial importance to Cray
Computer was one of several key points Cray Research revealed
Wednesday in an information statement on the new company.
   In addition to hinging on Seymour Cray's presence, the $98.6
million financial gift from Cray Research depends on no individual
acquiring more than 20 percent ownership in the new firm, Cray
Computer continuing to pursue the Cray-3 project and the avoidance
of bankruptcy by the new firm.
   The split places the hopes for the 1990s of Minneapolis-based
Cray Research squarely on the C-90 supercomputer design under way
in Chippewa Falls, Wis.

<HEAD>EDS: RECASTS throughout to UPDATE with later activity, closing indices;

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices closed modestly lower Thursday after
London's confidence was shaken by unconfirmed rumors of an
insider-trading scandal touching the government and by continued
declines on Wall Street.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index lost 6.0
points, or 0.27 percent, to close at 2,154.1, roughly midway
between its session low of 2,146.3 and high of 2,160.3. The key
index moved around its closing level for much of the afternoon,
although it hit the day's highs on a brief flurry of technical
buying in early afternoon trading.
   Volume was 348.4 million shares, down from 379.9 million on
Wednesday.
   The widely circulated insider-trading rumor was tied to a report
in a Scottish newspaper that a British television network was about
to name at least one senior government official in a report on
insider dealing. The rumor prompted speculation of further
upheavals within the government and sent London shares lower at the
outset.
   The specific focus was on Transport Minister Cecil Parkinson,
who strongly denied the rumors.
   The denial helped ease the market's worries, but dealers said
more wind was taken out of London's sails by a subsequent
announcement that Ford Motor Co. reached an agreed bid of 850 pence
a share, or 1.6 billion pounds, for British automaker Jaguar PLC.
   The news, along with a statement from General Motors Corp.,
ended most of the speculation over a bidding war for the luxury
automaker.
   Wall Street's early declines kept London under pressure for much
of the afternoon, dealers said.
   ``The insider-trading rumors really kept the market at bay,'' a
senior dealer with Kleinwort Benson Securities said. ``It set the
tone. But mostly people were just not too keen to rush and buy it.
And they weren't too keen to sell it, either.''
   The big stock feature of the day, however, was Jaguar at 30
million shares traded.
   The FT 30-share index settled 6.8 points lower at 1,731.3. The
FT 500-share index was down 3.72 at 1,195.09.

   Increases in the prices farmers get for their
crops and livestock have not kept up with the cost of producing
them, Agriculture Department figures show.
   Since 1977, prices paid by farmers for things they need to
produce crops and livestock have risen 78 percent. Prices received
by farmers for those crops and livestock, meanwhile, have gone up
44 percent.
   It doesn't take much expertise in economics to assert that
something is out of whack and that the marketplace has
short-changed farmers by not keeping pace with rising expenses.
That is one reason Congress has provided subsidies for farmers, to
help make up the difference.
   Last week's ``agricultural prices'' report by the department's
National Agricultural Statistics Service included some comparative
figures to show how the expenses of farming have changed in the
last year.
   Prices are not the same as expenditures and do not necessarily
translate into a financial balance sheet for the nation's farmers.
   For example, not every farmer will buy a tractor this year,
which costs more than it did last year. Same for hay balers,
shovels, fencing and other equipment used on the farm.
   Moreover, all farmers do not buy the same things. A vegetable
farmer in California might be upset by a price increase for cartons
used for produce, but an Iowa hog producer would be more interested
in feed prices.
   But if prices of several items keep going up over a long period
of time, it has an impact. Energy costs, for example, are almost
universally important, regardless of a farm's location or
specialty. So are interest rates.
   And if prices paid for crops and livestock remain the same or
decline, there will be trouble at the bank when the loan comes due.
   Not all purchase items are surveyed by USDA every month, but the
report for October included several categories that are looked at
once or twice a year.
   The overall price index of ``prices paid for commodities and
services, interest, taxes and farm wage rates'' was reported at 178
in October, compared to a rating of 100 for 1977, which is used by
the USDA as the base year for comparisons.
   The index just for items used by farmers for production stood at
164 in October. These include prices for feeder livestock, feed,
gasoline, building and fencing materials, machinery, fertilizer,
trucks and other products.
   One of the quirks in the price index is that some basic items
are an expense for farmers who buy them, and income for others who
produce and sell the commodity. Corn and other feed grains are
examples, along with feeder cattle and feeder pigs.
   Feed prices in October had an index reading of 128, the report
said. That was a 3.8 percent drop from July and was 9.2 percent
below October 1988. Prices of feeder livestock were down 1.6
percent from July but were unchanged from a year ago.
   The feeder livestock price index was 196 in October _ nearly
double what it was in the 1977 base year.
   The index for fertilizer was 131 in October, down 7.1 percent
from the previous reading taken in April, and 2.2 percent below a
year ago.
   In the category of fuels and energy, the index stood at 184 in
October, down 2.1 percent from July but 11.5 percent above October
1988.
   For big-ticket items, the index tracking tractors and
self-propelled machinery rose 3.6 percent from last April to 199 in
October _ about double the 1977 price average. It was also a 5.9
percent increase from a year earlier.
   A big, four-wheel-drive tractor in the 170-to 240-horsepower
range cost an average of $79,500 in October, according to the
survey, down $200 from April but up $2,700 from last year.
   Two-wheel-drive tractors in the range of 110 to 129 horsepower
were reported at $44,600 last month, up from $43,200 in April and
$41,200 a year ago.
   A ``large capacity'' self-propelled combine with grain head was
shown at $99,800, against $91,600 in October 1988.
   There are plenty of smaller, less-glamorous items that are
necessary in farming, and many of these have to be replaced or
added to from time to time. Here are a few of those price
comparisons:
   _Rough boards for farm fences and construction, $523 per 1,000
board feet in October, up from $521 in July and $511 a year ago.
   _House paint, exterior latex, $16.60 per gallon, compared with
$16.50 in July and $16.10 a year ago.
   _Baler twine, $22.10 per 40-pound bale, up from $21.80 in April
and $21.20 a year ago.
   _Electric drill, three-eighths inch, variable speed, reversible,
$48.30 in October and $46.60 a year earlier.
   _Pail, 12-quart, metal, heavy galvanized, $6.05, compared with
$5.78 both in April and a year ago.
   _Rear tractor tire, 18.4-38, six-ply, $437 in October, $428 in
April and $425 a year ago.

   The stock market declined broadly today as
traders awaited the latest reading on the state of the economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 22.13 to
2,623.77 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 9 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 510 up, 969 down and
478 unchanged.
   The Labor Department is due to report Friday morning on the
employment situation for October.
   Advance estimates call for the figures to show a relatively
modest increase in nonfarm payroll employment, reinforcing recent
evidence of slowing economic growth. That would presumably give the
Federal Reserve extra leeway to relax its credit policy soon,
encouraging interest rates to fall.
   But brokers said investors were still worried about unexpectedly

suffer further this winter, even if the economy is able to achieve
a ``soft landing'' rather than any severe slump.

<TEXT>
   Futures prices of grain and soybeans posted
moderate gains Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade, supported by
market rumors of pending export sales of U.S. grain to the Soviet
Union and China.
   ``It was mostly a Russian day,'' said trader Victor Lespinasse
of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., referring to talk that the Soviets
were seeking to buy 4 million metric tons of U.S. corn and 200,000
to 500,000 metric tons of U.S. soybean meal.
   The Soviet Union also was rumored to be shopping for wheat and
analysts said the Agriculture Department was expected to announce
it is targeting China for sales of 1 million metric tons of U.S.
wheat at subsidized prices.
   The soybean market also benefitted from a survey showing
Brazilian soybean planting running well behind the normal pace.
   Brazil is the world's second-largest soybean producer after the
United States. Analysts said economic troubles are forcing South
American farmers to reduce their plantings of both soybeans and
corn.
   Wheat futures settled unchanged to 4 cents higher with the
contract for December delivery at $4.02 a bushel; corn was
unchanged to 3 cents higher with December at $2.40{ a bushel; oats

<HEAD>Steinberg Stake Could Be Catalyst For New UAL Bid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investor Saul Steinberg is unlikely to lead a
takeover bid for UAL Corp., but he could play a big supporting role
in the next act of the UAL buyout saga, industry analysts said
Thursday.
   Steinberg, who is said to be a close friend of UAL Chairman
Stephen Wolf, took center stage Wednesday when his Reliance Group
Holdings Inc. filed for federal antitrust clearance to buy more
than 15 percent but less than 25 percent of UAL's stock.
   Such a request often signals that the petitioner seeks an active
role in the target company and usually a measure of control. But
because of his association with Wolf, analysts said Steinberg
probably was positioning himself to help UAL's chairman attempt
another buyout or a corporate restructuring.
   Chicago-based UAL is the parent of United Airlines, the nation's
second-largest carrier and one of its most profitable.
   UAL stock surged in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange
but the rally faded to a gain of only 75 cents a share by midday,
with the stock trading at $177.75.
   The stock had traded as high as $294 a share last month when it
appeared that a $6.75 billion buyout proposal by Wolf, United's
pilots union and British Airways PLC would succeed. The deal soured
three weeks ago when the group said it couldn't get adequate
financing for the $300-a-share bid.
   Steinberg helped lure Wolf to run Tiger International Inc. when
Steinberg was a director and major investor in the air cargo
company. Its subsidiary Flying Tiger, which has since merged with
Federal Express Corp., became profitable under Wolf _ who went on
to join UAL, then called Allegis Corp., in 1987.
   Now Wolf is the one needing help and Steinberg may be looking to
return the favor, said Jack Hunter, an analyst with Howe Barnes
Investments Inc. in Chicago.
   ``He (Steinberg) might be the catalyst to say, `Hey, this
company is a good company, its undervalued, let's get the unions
and everybody together and see if we can all walk forward,'''
Hunter said.
   Support from United's unions, especially the pilots and the
powerful Machinists, is believed to be crucial to any transaction,
whether instigated by UAL's board of directors or an outsider.
   The Machinists union bitterly opposed the proposed
pilot-management buyout, but union officials have recently taken a
conciliatory stance and say they are willing to compromise to
prevent an outside takeover.
   But the Machinists, who represent more than a third of UAL's
workers, expressed wariness Thursday about Steinberg.
   ``It looks like he's looking to run UAL stock up again,'' said
union spokesman James Conley in Washington, D.C. ``We will probably
take a look at everything that comes down the road but ... we're
opposed to running UAL stock up again to the point where we feel
the stock is overpriced.''
   Hunter figured a fair price for UAL stock is $190 to $220 a
share.
   Neither the pilots nor United's flight attendants would comment
on the Steinberg development. The flight attendants joined the
pilot-management group last month after British Airways dropped out.
   Analyst Kevin Murphy of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. in New York said
recent high-volume trading of UAL stock indicated that another
party may have acquired a substantial stake in the company.
   That party's identity might be revealed in the next several
days, he said, through a Securities and Exchange Commission filing
required of investors who make large purchases of a company's stock.
   If a takeover-minded third party does surface, Murphy said, the
employee-management group may feel compelled to make a new buyout
bid at a lower price.
   As for Steinberg, he said, ``I think he's being prepared to
perhaps be allied with his old business friend Steve Wolf in the
event there is a bid.''

<TEXT>
   The president of American City Business
Journals Inc., which operates 21 local weekly business
publications, is stepping down and the company is moving its
headquarters to Charlotte, N.C.
   Michael K. Russell, American City president who founded the
company in 1982 with his longtime business partner William H.
Worley, said Wednesday he was stepping down as president effective
Nov. 30.
   The loss of the publishing headquarters will affect about 20
jobs in Kansas City, although an undetermined number of employees
may be transferred to Charlotte, Russell said. An additional 40
jobs, at the firm's Kansas City Business Journal, will not be
affected, he said.
   Shaw Publishing Inc., a Charlotte-based publishing company, owns
30 percent of American City and has agreed to purchase an
additional 25 percent from the E.W. Scripps Co. in 1990.
   Ray Shaw, the head of Shaw Publishing, became American City's
chairman and chief executive officer in June.
   Russell, 50, said American City's headquarters was being moved
to Charlotte to consolidate administrative operations with Shaw
Publishing. The move was expected to be completed over the next two
months, he said.
   When asked why he was resigning, Russell, a native of Kansas
City, Kan., said, ``I don't want to move to Charlotte.''
   Shaw said in a statement that he would assume Russell's
responsibilities is a successor isn't selected by Nov. 30.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Assets of the nation's 476 money market mutual
funds rose $2.19 billion in the latest week, a fourth straight
record, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   The rise, to a record $359.71 billion in the seven-day period
ended Wednesday, followed a $1.26 billion increase in the funds'
assets the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual
fund trade group.
   The previous record for the funds' assets was $357.52 billion in
the week ended Oct. 25. Last week's total was originally reported
as $357.49 billion.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 236 general purpose funds rose $750 million to $117.66
billion, assets of 97 broker-dealer funds increased $1.45 billion
to $157.24 billion, and assets of 143 institutional funds declined
$6.7 million to $84.82 billion.
   It was the 23rd straight week of increases in both categories of
funds that attract small investors' money: broker-dealer funds and
general-purpose funds.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in
the week ended Tuesday to 8.12 percent from 8.14 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell to 8.19 percent from 8.22 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
41 days, up from 40 days, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan associations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts was 6.40
percent as of Wednesday, unchanged from a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, was unchanged at 5.09 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 8.18
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 8.20 the
previous week. Yields were 8.22 percent on 1-year CDs, down from
8.24 percent; 8.16 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 8.17 percent;
and 8.14 percent on 5-year CDs, down from 8.15 percent.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar finished mixed in light trading
Thursday as dealers awaited the release of fresh data on the
economy.
   The price of gold, spurred by new foreign appetite for the
metal, rose sharply. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold
bullion for current delivery rose $6.20 a troy ounce to close at
$380.40 an ounce. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late
bid for gold of $378.80 an ounce, up $5.90 from Wednesday's late
bid.
   The dollar fluctuated in a narrow range as dealers awaited
Friday's release of U.S. unemployment figures for October.
   Kevin Lawrie, a vice president at Bank of Boston's New York
office, said currency dealers were looking for a slight increase in
unemployment, which would prove bearish for the dollar.
   ``Higher unemployment generally signifies a slowdown in the
economy, possibly moving toward a more recessionary atmosphere''
and pressuring the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, he said.
   Lower interest rates make U.S. securities less attractive to
foreigners and dampen their need for dollars.
   Much of the day's trading centered on other currencies,
particularly the British pound, which took a beating following
rumors that one or possibly two government ministers had resigned
because of insider-trading offenses.
   Despite a denial issued by the prime minister's office, the
pound still lost more than 1.5 cents against the dollar. Traders
said the West German mark and Japanese yen directly benefitted from
the pound's troubles.
   Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 143.75 yen, up from
143.08 yen on Wednesday. In London late Thursday, the dollar ended
lower at 143.65 yen. In New York, the dollar finished at 143.43
yen, down from 143.80 yen late Wednesday.
   In London, one pound cost $1.5660, cheaper for buyers than
Wednesday's late $1.5815. In New York, one pound cost $1.5695, less
expensive than $1.5755 on Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Wednesday's
late rates, included: 1.8424 West German marks, down from 1.8505;
1.6162 Swiss francs, down from 1.6260; 6.2490 French francs, down
from 6.2740; 1,354.75 Italian lire, down from 1.358.75; and 1.1733
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1743.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Wednesday's
late rates, included: 1.8485 West German marks, up from 1.8377;
1.6140 Swiss francs, up from 1.6132; 6.2670 French francs, up from
6.2305; 2.0860 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0790; 1,356.00 Italian
lire, up from 1,348.50; and 1.1725 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1742.
   Trading in gold bullion was light. In London the metal finished
at a bid price of $375.25 a troy ounce, up from Wednesday's late
$374.25. The closing bid price in Zurich, Switzerland, was $375.00,
up from $373.40. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at $373.85 bid,
up from $373.65.
   Silver prices were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery rose to $5.255 a troy ounce from $5.150 on
Wednesday. Silver traded late in London at $5.17 bid a troy ounce,
down from $5.18.

   Oil futures prices finished lower Thursday,
unable to sustain a brief midday technical rally.
   The December contract for West Texas Intermediate, the U.S.
benchmark grade of crude oil, ended at $20.01 a 42-gallon barrel on
the New York Mercantile Exchange, down 6 cents from the previous
session. January crude fell 7 cents to $19.71 a barrel.
   Refined products traded on the exchange also declined. Wholesale

52.20 cents a gallon, while the January contract declined 0.25 cent
to 52.46 cents a gallon.
   December heating oil finished 0.37 cent lower at 59.99 cents a
gallon and the January contract lost 0.30 cent to 59.65 cents.
   Energy brokers said crude oil prices rallied earlier in the day
on technical factors but stopped short of piercing the
$20.40-a-barrel level.
   ``I haven't seen anything that would have caused the rally,''
said Brian Tagler, a trader with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Analysts said the rally fizzled in afternoon trading as
investors began liquidating and taking profits.

   Jaguar PLC said Thursday it was joining the Ford
Motor Co. fleet in a $2.5 billion buyout, a surprising reversal
that saw Ford winning over a venerable luxury car maker that once
labeled it an unwanted suitor.
   The deal, which combines the vast resources of the American
automaker with the high style of the much smaller British firm, is
expected to further the interests of both companies in the growing
international market for luxury cars.
   ``The partnership we are proposing will enable Jaguar to grow
and become increasingly competitive,'' Lindsay Halstead, chairman
of Ford Europe, said at a news conference.
   To win over Jaguar, Ford had to beat back a challenge from its
chief rival, General Motors Corp., which had been negotiating for
months to acquire a stake in Jaguar.
   Soon after the deal was announced, GM, the world's biggest
automaker, said it would not bid against No. 2 Ford for the company.
   Jaguar shareholders must approve the $13.35-a-share takeover
offer by a 75 percent majority. A shareholder meeting is scheduled
for the end of the month.
   Jaguar, which has roots dating to 1922, had been expected to be
the target of a multibillion-dollar bidding war between General
Motors and Ford after the British government announced Tuesday that
it was prepared to waive its ``golden share'' power to veto any
Jaguar takeover.
   Ford owns 13.2 percent of Jaguar and had indicated it would
mount a buyout bid once takeover restrictions were dropped. General
Motors had acquired regulatory approval to buy up to 15 percent of
Jaguar and its friendly talks with the automaker had been expected
to result in a GM stake of possibly 30 percent.
   But General Motors concluded Jaguar was not worth the $13.35 a
share Ford offered to pay.
   ``After an intensive review of Jaguar's products and plants and
in view of the losses currently being sustained by them, together
with Jaguar's significant future cash and other requirements, GM
concluded that the maximum value that could be assigned to all of
the Jaguar shares was very significantly below the 8.50 pounds
($13.35) being offered...'' a GM statement read.
   Jaguar finished at the equivalent of $13.02 a share Thursday on
London's Stock Exchange, down from Wednesday's close of $14.26.
   Analysts said that although Ford was not Jaguar's first choice,
the British carmaker should thrive under its ownership.
   Jaguar saw its pretax profit drop by nearly 6 percent in the
first half of 1989, largely due to slumping U.S. sales. It has been
looking for 18 months for a partner to provide financial and
technological support to expand its narrow product line and compete
better.
   Jaguar Chairman Sir John Egan told a news conference Thursday
that he regretted Jaguar's loss of independence, but he said Ford
offered a good price and made guarantees about operating
independence.
   Jaguar will be run as a separate entity, will retain an
independent board of directors, its production in Britain will
continue and Jaguar's dealer network will be maintained, the
companies said. Egan also will remain for the immediate future.
   ``To put it simply, the board had a very good offer indeed,''
Egan said. ``They were prepared to make satisfactory guarantees
about how Jaguar would be operated in the future.''
   Some Britons immediately regretted the loss of a truly British
institution.
   The opposition Liberal Democrats accused the government of
scuttling Jaguar's negotiations with General Motors by dropping its
veto power. Party member Matthew Taylor accused the government of
``sending the autonomy of the British car industry to the scrap
heap.''
   Ford's Halstead said there was considerable potential to
increase sales volume by expanding Jaguar's product range in
Europe, the United States and elsewhere.
   He said Ford would inject an unspecified amount of funds into
Jaguar to develop the company's existing product range and boost
its research and development. Jaguar also will be able to use
Ford's worldwide engineering, purchasing and manufacturing
technologies.

<HEAD>Gold Hits Three-Month High As Stocks Sink</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The gold futures market drew strength from the stock market's
decline Thursday, hitting three-month highs on New York's Commodity
Exchange amid growing fears of a worsening outlook for equity
investments.
   On other commodity markets, copper futures fell sharply;
stock-index futures sank; pork bellies surged for the fourth
straight day while livestock futures retreated; grains and soybeans
advanced; and oil futures fell.
   Gold settled $6 to $6.20 higher with the contract for delivery
in December at $382.90 a troy ounce, its highest settlement since
July 26. Silver finished 10.2 cents to 10.6 cents higher with
December at $5.29 a troy ounce.
   The gold market's gains more than offset its modest losses in
each of the three previous sessions.
   Analysts said the strength stemmed partly from the stock
market's steep intraday losses, although stock prices rebounded
after the gold futures market closed.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials finished with a 14-point
loss after falling as much as 33 points during the session.
   The stock market's volatile performance in recent weeks has sent
many investors running to the perceived safety of precious metals
and gold stocks, and Thursday's drop in stock prices encouraged the
trend.
   ``This is a thrust and it's intensifying,'' said Bette
Raptopoulos, metals analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
in New York.
   Gold was also supported by the dollar's weakness and the
inflationary implications of generally higher commodity prices on
Thursday.
   August Arace, co-manager of Freedom Gold and Government Trust
Fund, said gold's gains in the past week also reflected new buying
by Russian citizens worried that recent moves to devalue the ruble
could lead to greater inflation in the Soviet Union.
   Copper futures weakened on news that a contract dispute at a
Chilean copper mining complex had been settled.
   Copper settled 90 cents to 3.35 cents lower with the contract
for delivery in December at $1.134 a pound.
   Stock-index futures closed with moderate losses on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. The contract for December delivery of stocks
in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index settled 3.8 cents lower at
339.50. The contract is worth $500 per point.
   Frozen pork-belly futures rose sharply on the Chicago Merc in
anticipation of new demand from Eastern Europe. Yugoslavia recently
bought some U.S. pork bellies, the Soviets are interested in buying
some and the United States was scheduled to sign an agreement
Friday that would lead to the shipment of up to 10,000 metric tons
of bellies to Poland.
   Pork bellies finished .05 cent to 1.12 cents higher with
February at 58.72 cents a pound; live cattle were .20 cent to .60
cent lower with December at 73.75 cents a pound; feeder cattle were
.15 cent to .40 cent lower with November at 82.72 cents a pound;
hogs were .10 cent to .58 cent lower with December at 47.17 cents a
pound.
   Grain and soybean futures posted moderate gains on the Chicago
Board of Trade, supported by market rumors of pending export sales
of U.S. grain to the Soviet Union and China.
   Wheat settled \ cent to 3{ cents higher with December at $4.01{
a bushel; corn was unchanged to 3 cents higher with December at
$2.40{ a bushel; oats were 1} cents to 2 cents higher with December
at $1.45\ a bushel; soybeans were 4} cents to 8{ cents higher with
November at $5.66{ a bushel.
   Oil futures prices finished lower on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, unable to sustain a brief technical rally at midday.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 1 cent to 7 cents
lower with December at $20.01 a barrel; heating oil was .26 cent to
.37 cent lower with December at 59.99 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline waas .05 cent to .69 cent lower with December at 52.20
cents a gallon.

<HEAD>Broadest Money Supply Measure Slightly Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The broadest measure of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended Oct. 23, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M3 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $4,036.8 billion from $4,031.9 billion.
   A somewhat narrower measure known as M2 was unchanged at a
seasonally adjusted $3,179.6 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, was also
unchanged at a seasonally adjusted $789.0 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 4.3 percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The annual growth rate in M3 is 3.8 percent, which is also within
the Fed's target range of 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent. The Fed has
not set a target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,152.2 billion, an 8.2
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,015.1 billion, up 4.2 percent, while M1
rose 3.8 percent to an average of $781.6 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $289 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, down from
$356 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve said net free reserves averaged $844
million in the two weeks ended Wednesday, up from a revised $291
million in the previous two-week period.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $293.8 billion in the two-week period ended
Nov. 1, unchanged from two weeks earlier.

<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   KLM Royal Dutch Airlines on
Thursday announced it was reducing its planned stake in the parent
of Northwest Airlines in compliance with U.S. regulations.
   The Dutch flag carrier, which operates a worldwide network from
its base at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport, will reduce by $300
million its stake in NWA Inc., to $150 million, a KLM spokesman
said.
   KLM, which joined the European airline stampede for U.S.
partners earlier this year, is a participant in a $3.8 billion bid
to take over NWA by a group of U.S. investors led by Los Angeles
financier Alfred Checchi.
   KLM's announcement comes only weeks after British Airways PLC
abandoned its efforts to take a substantial interest in UAL Corp.,
the parent of United Airlines.
   The attempt by Western European carriers to gain a foothold in
the North American market has drawn fierce congressional criticism
in the United States, and the U.S. Department of Transportation has
set strict guidelines governing such moves.

<HEAD>Bush Commends Xerox, Milliken for Business Leadership</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Thursday commended two
companies, Xerox Corp. and the Milliken &amp; Co. textile company, as
examples of firms that are ``leading the resurgence in American
business leadership.''
   Bush presented the 1989 Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award,
named for the late commerce secretary, to the chairmen of the two
companies in a ceremony at the Commerce Department.
   Bush said the two companies responded to the need for
improvement in quality and service by U.S. companies, which are
``national priorities as never before.''
   ``In recent years, Americans have felt the sting of fierce
competition on a global scale. And we've learned to see foreign
competition not as an excuse to close doors and raise barriers, but
as an incentive to renew our own commitment to excellence.''
   The president lauded both Xerox and Milliken for creative
management practices.
   ``They're leading the resurgence in American business
leadership,'' he said. ``Most companies catch hell from the
competition. But these two companies are in the lead because no
competitor gave them a tougher time than they gave themselves.''
   Bush said there was a time when both Xerox and Milliken ``were
being steadily squeezed out by the intense foreign and domestic
competition. In the midst of this crisis, the men and women of
these companies found within themselves the will to make a
painstaking reassessment and the drive to win back that market
share.''
   Xerox, the Stamford, Conn.-based copy-products giant, employs
50,200 people throughout the country and makes more than 250 kinds
of document-processing equipment. Its 1988 U.S. sales topped $6
billion.
   The privately owned Milliken, headquartered in Spartanburg,
S.C., has 28 businesses that produce textile and chemical products
with annual sales of more than $1 billion.
   Milliken's 14,300 employees are called ``associates'' of the
company whose management structure relies heavily on teams, such as
the corrective active teams formed to address manufacturing and
business problems, and Supplier Action Teams that deal with the
firm's relationships with its suppliers.
   The Malcolm Baldrige award honors the memory of the Commerce
secretary and rodeo enthusiast who was killed in a freak accident
in July 1987. He was crushed by a horse that fell on him while he
was cattle roping.

<HEAD>Bush, GOP Concede Defeat on Capital Gains Tax Cut</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 5th graf, `There was ...,' with 3 grafs to UPDATE with
Democratic response. Also moving on general news wires.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush and Senate Republicans offered
Thursday to end their attempts to attach a capital gains tax cut to
crucial debt legislation, all but conceding defeat for the year on
what has been Bush's top legislative priority.
   ``We have tried to work constructively and cooperatively with
the Congress in a true spirit of bipartisanship,'' said a statement
from the president. ``Now the stalemate must be broken.''
   With an increase in the national debt limit needed next week to
stave off a default by the Treasury, Senate Minority Leader Bob
Dole, R-Kan., told Democrats that Republicans would agree to limit
amendments to the debt-ceiling legislation to those repealing a
Medicare tax to finance catastrophic illness coverage and a tax
provision opposed by business.
   ``No capital gains amendment will be offered,'' he said on the
Senate floor minutes after a meeting with top White House officials
including Chief of Staff John Sununu, Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady and budget director Richard Darman.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, who met
Thursday evening with House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., and
other Democratic leaders, said afterwards they were ``heartened by
the statement made by the president.''
   Mitchell said he would make a counter-offer to Dole and ``we're
not rejecting anything.'' He declined to offer details.
   Democratic sources, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said
they found the GOP proposal attractive. They wanted, however, to
make sure the Republicans would end ``back-door'' attempts to win
approval of a capital gains tax cut, such as a pending amendment to
attach it to a bill providing aid to Poland and Hungary.
   A White House statement said Bush's primary interest was in
reducing the federal deficit and preventing Democrats from adding
costly new programs.
   Republicans have been trying for weeks to break a Democratic
blockade of their plan to cut the capital gains tax. Democrats have
called the tax cut a giveaway to the rich and accused Bush and the
Republicans of sacrificing other priorities in their pursuit of the
tax cut.
   ``I deeply regret the tone of partisanship that has entered the
economic policy debate,'' Bush said in the statement. ``I would
very much have preferred a fair and balanced debate _ and vote _ on
the merits. But the congressional process has bogged down.''
   The stalemate has delayed the legislative agenda to the point
where the government is threatened with default next week because
the Treasury's $2.8 trillion debt limit has not been raised.
   By attaching the popular tax repeal measures to the debt-ceiling
bill, Republicans would take away from the Democrats the most
attractive features of a separate tax and entitlement bill now
being negotiated between the House and the Senate. Democrats would
lose leverage for their sometimes costly initiatives in that bill,
including expanding health care benefits for the poor.
   The tax and entitlement bill's underlying purpose is to reduce
the federal deficit selectively and thus cancel $16.1 billion in
spending cuts that took effect Oct. 1 because Congress and the
president had failed to meet the goals of the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law.
   Republicans said that their move was designed to force Democrats
to pass a ``clean'' deficit-reduction bill or face the prospect of
leaving the Gramm-Rudman cuts in place.
   ``If the Congress cannot agree upon a clean (deficit-reduction)
bill that fully meets the test of fiscal responsibility, we are
prepared to manage the government under'' the Gramm-Rudman cuts
``for as long as it takes to reach agreement on a fiscally
responsible bill,'' said the White House statement.
   Before Democrats could consider the offer, Republican Sen. Steve
Symms of Idaho blocked Senate action on a bipartisan plan to raise
the minimum wage for the first time in eight years. Symms refused
to allow debate unless he were given a chance to add amendments on
capital gains and repealing catastrophic illness coverage and the
business tax rule known as Section 89.
   Adopted by Congress last year but not yet put into effect by the
Internal Revenue Service, Section 89 would deny tax breaks to
companies that do not offer the same health benefits to all levels
of employees.
   Democrats on Thursday said Republican suggestions that the
automatic cuts remain in place were ``the irresponsible approach.''
   Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the House Budget
Committee, said the Gramm-Rudman cuts would cancel the planned
increase in fighting illegal drugs, cost one million students their
college grants and hurt the Pentagon, veterans and the homeless.
   ``It is really a coward's approach to deficit reduction,'' he
said.
   Dole said supporters of reducing the capital gains tax would
continue to pursue their goal on other bills by ``redoubling our
efforts.'' Senate rules, however, appeared to reduce their chances
of success.
   Rep. Robert Michel, R-Ill., the House minority leader, said he
was willing to live with the automatic cuts for a while, but he
considered the increase in the debt ceiling crucial.
   ``We can't let the government topple on that (capital gains)
issue, at least the government's ability to pay it's bills, honor
its commitments,'' said Michel, who also attended the meeting.
   The congressional Republicans indicated there was frustration on
the part of the White House.
   ``We have to keep telling the governor (former New Hampshire
Gov. Sununu) from time to time it's not quite like dealing with the
legislature, because the president doesn't have line-item veto
(power) and some other things like that,'' Michel said.

   The last edition of the once-powerful Los
Angeles Herald Examiner hit the streets Thursday, but only briefly
as souvenir seekers cleaned out most newsracks shortly after dawn.
   Entrepreneurs were reportedly getting as much as $20 a copy for
the papers with a bold ``SO LONG, L.A.!'' headline.
   ``Some kid on fraternity row flagged down the Herald truck when
it got here this morning and bought six bundles (of 50 papers
each),'' said Gary Pine at the sports information office at the
University of Southern California.
   ``The last we heard, he'd sold three bundles _ at $20 a copy.''
   At a Herald Examiner building downtown, crowds jammed a lobby to
buy papers. Some, like Robert Fregoso, purchased whole 50-paper
bundles for the normal 25 cents a copy.
   ``I've read the Herald all my life,'' said Fregoso, 43. ``I used
to sell them on the street 35 years ago down on Alameda and 42nd.''
   Fregoso said he was going to give the papers away to his best
customers at Ricky's, a cocktail lounge he runs.
   Morning sales at the spot where Fregoso picked up his papers
were as brisk as 1,000 copies an hour, Herald Examiner employee
Belen Cruz said.
   Scores of buyers lined up on the street to get copies. When the
presses shut down about 4 p.m., more than 370,000 papers had been
distributed, according to production director Ray Willis _ half
again as much as usual.
   The Herald Examiner was born in 1962 when the morning Examiner,
founded by newspaper baron William Randolph Hearst in 1903, was
merged with the evening Herald Express, founded in 1871, and became
the city's sole afternoon paper.
   The Herald Examiner and its predecessors were a huge part of the
city's newspapering lore.
   Thousands of dollars were once kept in a safe in case Hearst
needed quick cash or a reporter had to be bailed out of jail. The
Examiner had scoops on everything from the ``Black Dahlia'' murder
case to the explosion of the first H-bomb.
   But the problems at the Herald Examiner, once the largest
afternoon paper in the country with a circulation of more than
700,000, were longstanding, officials acknowledged in announcing
its closure Wednesday.
   At the same time Hearst merged the two papers into one afternoon
daily in 1962, Times Mirror Corp. merged its Times and Mirror into
the morning-delivery Times. That started a gradual slide in
circulation and advertising away from the Herald Examiner.
   The mortal blow was a bitter 10-year strike beginning in 1967.
Hearst tried to recover by hiring talented editors, broadening
coverage beyond the traditional blue-collar sports-and-crime
emphasis and changing to morning publication.
   Journalists plan a ``wake'' for the Herald Examiner on Sunday
night at the Los Angeles Press Club.
   ``The demise of the Herald Examiner is like the death of an old
friend,'' wrote Daily Variety columnist Army Archerd. ``Especially
for those of us who worked there in the halcyon days of the Hearst
newspaper empire when it was the Herald-Express.''
   John Morton, a newspaper analyst at the Lynch, Jones &amp; Ryan
brokerage firm in Washington, said the Herald had improved
dramatically in recent years.
   But ``once you get as far down in circulation in comparison with
your competitor as they were, you can be the best newspaper in
America and it's not going to add to your advertising revenue,''
Morton said.
   With a daily circulation of 238,000, compared to the Times' 1.1
million, and with losses exceeding $1.5 million per month, Hearst
tried to find a buyer for the Herald, then announced the shutdown
when no one could be found.

   Newspapers scrambled Thursday to capitalize
on the death of the Herald Examiner by adding news racks, snaring
prize comics and courting advertisers.
   But analysts and newspaper officials said most papers in the
area will be little affected, and even if they pick up readers they
will have to wait at least six months before they can pass on the
costs of printing additional papers to advertisers.
   ``I would think there will be some costs before there are some
benefits,'' said newspaper industry analyst John S. Reidy at Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc.
   In addition, many of the Herald's ads are already carried by
other papers.
   ``The surviving newspapers are going to get some additional
readers but are not going to get much incremental advertising,''
said J. Kendrick Noble, who follows the media industry for Paine
Webber Group Inc.
   Papers geared up immediately after Hearst Corp. announced
Wednesday it would close the Herald, which published its last issue
Thursday after years of big losses.
   Thomas J. Wafer Jr., general manager of Copley Los Angeles,
which owns The Outlook in Santa Monica, The Daily Breeze in
Torrance and The News Pilot in San Pedro, said, ``We intend to beef
up all three to pick up as much advertising as we can.''
   The Long Beach Press-Telegram said it will increase the number
of its news racks and may launch an advertising campaign. ``I'm
sure all of us will be vying for a piece of those readers,'' said
Mack Quintana, senior vice president of sales and marketing.
   The Herald Examiner's syndicated features and comics also went
up for grabs, and former competitors quickly moved in.
   ``The Los Angeles Times has agreed to pick up several of our
biggest features, including Beetle Bailey, Hagar the Horrible and
Hi &amp; Lois,'' said Ted Hannah, director of advertising and public
relations for King Features in New York.
   The Times said it would purchase more than 10,000 of the Herald
Examiner's news racks. Officials estimated the paper would pick up
at most 50,000 of the Herald's 238,000 readers.
   ``We hope to convert them to Times readers,'' said Times
publisher David Laventhol.
   But, he added: ``You are dealing with a relatively small pie
here, and it probably won't affect the marketplace. It's sad but
true.''
   David J. Auger, publisher of the San Fernando Valley-based Daily
News, agreed, saying the Herald's circulation was spread over the
entire greater Los Angeles area and was relatively insignificant in
suburban areas like the Valley and Orange County.
   ``The impact is fairly negligible in our area,'' Auger said.

   Mobil Oil Co. announced plans Thursday to spend
$468 million building a North Sea gas pipeline and onshore
processing plant at St. Fergus in northeast Scotland.
   A statement by the company said the project is expected to
create 700 construction jobs. The processing plant will have a

   Mobil said the 210-mile pipeline will carry gas to the plant
from Mobil's Beryl oil field in the oil- and gas-rich North Sea.
Gas is an important secondary product from North Sea oil production.
   The plant will sell 90 percent of the Beryl field's gas output
to British Gas PLC, the formerly state-owned company that has a
near-monopoly in supplying gas to Britain's industries and homes
through its nationwide pipeline system.
   The statement said the remaining 10 percent of the gas will be
sold by Mobil itself directly to industry.
   Mobil said the plant will have an output of 250,000 cubic feet a
day. It said the pipeline and plant will also be able to
accommodate gas from the Brae field in the North Sea.

   Just days after Fujitsu Ltd. failed in its attempt
to escape a contract for which it bid 1 yen, or about 0.7 of a U.S.
cent, the Japanese computer giant said Wednesday it was trying to
withdraw from another 1-yen deal it says lacks ``common sense.''
   Akira Imagawa, a spokesman at Fujitsu's headquarters in Tokyo,
said company officials in the Nagano prefecture in central Japan
had asked Nagano authorities to cancel a contract the company won
last month with a 1-yen bid.
   Both cases have attracted the attention of Japan's Fair Trade
Commission, whose officials say they are considering an
investigation into whether the unusually low bids constitute unfair
trade under the Anti-Monopoly Law.
   In the Nagano deal, Fujitu and electronics giant NEC Corp. made
identical 1-yen bids for a contract to design software for the
prefectural libary's computer system, local officials said.
   The prefectural government had set aside 16 million yen, or
about $112,000, in its budget for the project, the officials said
on condition of anonymity.
   ``Front-line salesmen desperately wanted to win the contract ...
but lacked common sense,'' Imagawa said.
   In the earlier case, Fujitsu officials, having said their 1-yen
bid to design software to map the Hiroshima city water supply
system represented a long-term investment, later appeared to change
their minds and asked the city to cancel the contract. The city had
budgeted 11 million yen, or $78,000, for the project.
   City officials refused, although they said their decision would
depend on the outcome of a possible Fair Trade Commission
investigation.
   ``We will continue to seek the city's understanding to retract
the contract,'' Fujitsu's Imagawa said.
   Meanwhile, officials of the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry cautioned Fujitsu on Tuesday about business practices
``beyond common sense,'' said an official of the ministry's
Electronics Policy Division.
   The official, who spoke anonymously, said the ministry also
urged major member companies in the Japan Electronics Industry
Development Associaton, a industrial grouping of computer and
electronics makers, ``not to make discount sales at irrational
prices.''
   Companies competing for both the Hiroshima and the Nagano
contracts reportedly saw the projects as a way to get a head start
on computer systems expected to be linked up throughout the country.
   But Makoto Sakata, a noted commentator, said the cases also
demonstrated that corporate ethics lag behind generally accepted
rules of behavior, with companies emphasizing their relations with
local officials rather than profitability.
   ``Looking at what Japan's leading high-technology companies like
Fujitsu and NEC are doing, It's painfully clear that modernaization
of Japanese corporations is superficial and that they in fact
remain unchanged from the feudal age,'' Sakata said.

<HEAD>N.E. Electric System Withdraws Bid for PSNH</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New England Electric System announced Wednesday it
has withdrawn its $2 billion bid for the financially troubled
Public Service Company of New Hampshire and its share of the
Seabrook nuclear power plant.
   John Rowe, New England Electric's president and chief executive
officer, said the prices being offered for PSNH by two other
bidders and the rate levels needed to support those prices are too
high.
   PSNH is operating under the protection of federal bankruptcy
laws.
   New England Electric is a public utility holding company based
in Westborough with three subsidiaries that serve customers in
Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New Hampshire.
   PSNH owns the largest single share in the Seabrook nuclear power
plant in New Hampshire, which continues to fight for a generating
license as its price tag continues to climb, standing now at about
$6.3 billion.
   The other bidders for PSNH are United Illuminating Co. of New
Haven, Conn., and Northeast Utilities of Hartford, Conn.
   United Illuminating has offered a bid it values at $2.29
billion, while Northeast Utilities put its bid at $2.25 billion.
   Public Service spokesman Bill Morrissey said the utility expects
the two bidders to raise their bids.
