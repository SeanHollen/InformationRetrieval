   Ousted President Nicolae Ceausescu and
his wife Elena were executed Monday after they were convicted of
genocide and ``grave crimes'' against Romania at a secret military
trial, the provisional government said.
   Ceausescu, 71, the last hard-line Communist leader in the Warsaw
Pact, was chased from power Friday after his dreaded security
forces massacred thousands protesting his repressive 24-year rule
and harsh economic policies.
   He and his wife, who served as a virtual second-in-command, were
executed by firing squad after a trial at an undisclosed location,
according to Bucharest Radio and Romanian television.
   The radio and television, which formerly were controlled by
Ceausescu, are under control of the National Salvation Comittee,
the new provisional government.
   Fighting in central Bucharest, which continued spporadically
late into the night, had driven many people from the streets by the
time the announcement of the executions was made around 8:30 p.m.
(1:30 p.m. EST.) However, cheers rang out from the few people on
the streets and from apartment balconies.
   The broadcasts on both radio and television did not specify
where the executions took place.
   Romanian television early Tuesday showed the Ceausescus before
their execution, being brought to an undisclosed location in an
armored car.
   Ceausecu, dressed in a dark suit and a heavy black overcoat,
looked gaunt and tired but smiled as a man in a white coat checked
his blood pressure. His wife looked forlorn as she sat against a
wall, dressed in a beige fur-lined coat with her head covered
peasant-style in a scarf.
   The footage also included a scene of the couple sitting at a
wooden table, apparently at their trial.
   Romanian staff at the Hotel Intercontinental clustered cheering
around a television set when the film appeared. Some even spat in
the direction of the television in a gesture of contempt.
   The film was the first of Ceausescu to be shown since the new
government announced his capture Saturday.
   Bucharest Radio blamed the Ceausescus for the deaths of more
than 60,000 Romanians and said they plundered the poor country of
more than $1 billion that they deposited in foreign banks. The
report did not make clear whether the deaths occurred during the
11-day uprising that toppled Ceausescu or during his entire tenure.
   ``Oh, what wonderful news!'' an unidentified announcer said.
   ``The anti-Christ died'' on Christmas Day, the announcer said.
   Ceausescu became the first Eastern European leader executed
since Imre Nagy, the leader of Hungary's revolt against Soviet rule
who has hanged in June 1958.
   The radio interrupted patriotic music to make the announcment
that the couple had been executed after being convicted by a
military tribunal of ``particularly grave crimes,'' including
subversion of the state, theft of public assets, destruction of the
national economy and an attempt to escape.
   ``Today, we removed the most hideous tyrant who soiled with
blood the history of Romania,'' an unidentified radio announcer
said. ``Let's be happy in the New Year.''
   The couple built a cult of personality unequaled in Eastern
Europe since the days of Josef Stalin. His party hailed him as
``the Conducator'' and the ``Genius of Carpathians.''
   Just one month ago, the Communist Party gave Ceausescu another
five-year term in a lavish show of support for his rejection of
reforms sweeping Eastern Europe.
   The National Salvation Committee had announced over the weekend
that it would put the Ceausescus on trial and impose severe
punishment. It was not immediately clear why the committee pledging
to restore democracy in Romania chose to put the Ceausescus on
trial in secret and execute them immediately.
   The decision could have stemmed from an attempt to stop the
fierce fighting in Bucharest and other cities between the
pro-Ceausescu security forces and the army, which is supporting the
popular revolt.
   ``We regret the trial did not take place in an open and public
fashion,'' White House spokesman Sean Walsh said in Washington.
``We urge an end to all violence and bloodshed in Romania.''
   Ceausescu came to power in 1965 and built an autocratic
Stalinist regime, but was once courted by the West for his refusal
to slavishly follow the Soviet line. In recent years his regime
became isolated and was criticized for the forced destruction of
ethnic villages and the draconian measures imposed to pay off the
nation's foreign debt.
   Ceausescu and his 72-year-old wife fled the presidential palace
by helicopter Friday.
   Their last public appearance was at a government-orchestrated
rally Thursday in Bucharest at which thousands of angry people
jeered them and demanded their ouster. Ceausescu appeared startled
and halted his speech. His troops later fired on the crowd.
   The Ceausescus' son Nicu and daughter, Zoia-Elena, were paraded
before TV viewers after their arrests on Friday and Sunday.
   On Monday, Ceausescu's die-hard security agents continued to
battle army patrols and snipers fired at civilians venturing onto
Bucharest streets. The fighting followed some of the fiercest
fighting in Europe since World War II.

   Heavy explosions boomed near the Hotel Intercontinental and
volleys of sniper fire were answered immediately with staccato
bursts of automatic weapons.
   There were widely conflicting reports on the number of
casualties claimed by the revolution.
   Hungarian radio named unspecified ``authoritative sources'' as
saying that between 70,000 and 80,000 people had died. Then it
cited Victor Ciobanu, health minister under Ceausescu and now in
opposition to him, as denying that such a large number of people
had died.
   While unable to provide overall casualty figures, he told
reporters 500 people had died in Bucharest alone over the past four
days, and 2,000 were wounded.
   That was on the low end of several estimates offered by
officials and appeared to contradict figures given by doctors
operating on the wounded. There was no way to independently verify
the casualty figures.
   At Bucharest Emergency Hospital, doctors who had not slept in
three days said they had treated 2,000 civilians since Thursday, a
fraction of the city total. By Sunday afternoon, 90 bodies had
arrived at one of several morgues.
   Army troops sealed off wide areas of the battle-scarred capital
in preparation for a building-to-building search of other
Securitate snipers supporting Ceausescu.
   A member of the new National Salvation Committee said his
transitional government was in control of Romania, but acknowledged
that much remained to be done.
   ``Even myself, I spent all night at the emergecy hospital,'' Ion
Grigorescu said, lifting a cuff to show a bandage and producing the
sniper's bullet that caught him in the leg as he went to the radio.
   By Monday, at least 12 nations _ including the United States _
had recognized the new leadership.
   Christmas dominated Bucharest despite the turmoil, with radio
broadcasting Mass and Christmas carols for the first time in
decades, and churches filled to overflowing.
   At the Patriarhie Orthodox cathedral in downtown Bucharest,
worshipers caught an agent of the security police trying to sneak a
hand grenade into Christmas Mass, after a woman started shouting,
``We know this man! He's a terrorist!'' He was led away by soldiers
armed with automatic rifles.
   Weekend reports that foreigners had been fighting alongside
Ceausescu's elite troops appeared to be gaining some credence
Monday.
   Doctors at the Emergency Hospital said they treated two men they
identified only as Arabs, and two more believed to be North Koreans.
   One of the Arabs admitted under sedation to being part of a
400-man elite Ceausescu guard committed to holding out until death
if needed for the defense of Ceausescu, said one of the doctors,
asking that he not be named.
   The crackling of machine-gun fire could be heard from some
Bucharest suburbs, but did not deter crowds from taking to the
streets.
   People clustered around spontaneous soapbox speakers denouncing
communism and generally enjoying their first chance to sound off in
public in four generations.
   The media, under the stern grip of censorship for more than four
decades, also was showing a freer face.
   Spark, the rigidly loyal Communist Party newspaper that was
dominated by pictures and reports of Ceausescu up to his fall,
appeared under the name of The Truth. Monday's edition published an
appeal of the National Salvation Committee _ the interim leadership
of the country _ for all civilians to surrender their arms,
alongside letters from former Ceausescu officials expressing
support for the committee.
   Among the array of new newspapers sprouting up over the weekend
was one called Free Youth, which denounced Ceausescu as the
``world's most atrocious criminal'' _ language unthinkable just 11
days ago.
   ``We have lost an epic of darkness and unthinkable terror on
Earth, we have also lost the fear to go out on the steets and
defend Romania with our hearts,'' a front-page editorial in Free
Youth proclaimed.
   Thousands of Romanians reportedly were massacred by security
officers who opened fire on unarmed anti-government protesters in
the western Romanian city of Timisoara Dec. 17, two days after the
start of demonstrations. The revolt spread across the country and
reached Bucharest Thursday when students defied gunfire to chant
for freedom.

   Billy Martin, the pugnacious five-time
manager of the New York Yankees baseball team who was repeatedly
fired after bouts of drinking and brawling, was killed Monday in an
alcohol-related traffic accident, authorities said. He was 61.
   Martin was riding in a pickup that skidded off a road in the
Town of Fenton, near his suburban home, at 5:45 p.m., when roads
were icy, authorities said. The truck skidded 300 feet down an
embankment and stopped at the foot of Martin's driveway, Port Crane
Fire Chief John Eldrid said.
   The driver, William Reedy, 53, of Detroit, was charged with
driving while intoxicated, Broome County Sheriff Anthony Ruffo said.
   Efforts to revive Martin at Wilson Memorial Hospital failed and
he died there about 7 p.m. of severe internal injuries and possible
head injuries, hospital spokesman Michael Doll said. Reedy, a
long-time friend of Martin's, suffered a broken hip and possible
broken ribs and was listed in serious condition, Doll said.
   An autopsy was scheduled to be performed on Martin Tuesday, Doll
said.
   ``It's like losing part of my own family,'' Yankees owner George
Steinbrenner said in a statement. ``I was just with him last
Wednesday when he came down to entertain 2,000 underprivileged kids
in Tampa. Billy said this meant so much to him because he never had
anything like this when he was a kid.''
   ``Baseball has lost one of its most unique and colorful
personalities and Oakland has lost a friend,'' said a statement
issued by the Haas family, owners of the Oakland Athletics, whom
Martin managed from 1980-82.
   Born Alfred Manuel Martin, he played second base for the Yankees
from 1950-57, including five World Series championship teams.
   He was honored with a plaque in Yankee Stadium's monument park,
a place reserved for the likes of Lou Gehrig, Babe Ruth and Joe
DiMaggio. His plaque proclaims Martin ``A Yankee Forever.''
   ``It was a big loss. He was a dear friend and I will miss him.
He was a great little guy,'' DiMaggio said in San Francisco.
   Martin was first hired to manage the team in 1975. His latest
firing was on June 23, 1988, when he was replaced by Lou Piniella,
the man he replaced at the end of the 1987 season. Steinbrenner
kept Martin on as a consultant.
   Martin brought his combative style to the manager's bench,
arguing with players and umpires and getting his teams to play a
hard-running game dubbed ``Billy ball.''
   But his exploits off the field clouded his later career. He got
into a fight in a topless bar in Texas on May 6, 1988, hours after
being ejected from a game for arguing a call with an umpire. Six
weeks later he was fired by Steinbrenner.
   ``In on-the-field management, he was the best field general I
ever played for. Off the field, he was all of those things and a
lot more,'' said Wayne Gross, who played under Martin in Oakland.
   His first managing stint typified his love-hate relationship
with the Yankees. He guided the team to a World Series title in
1977, a season marked by his shoving match with slugger Reggie
Jackson in the Boston stadium that June.
   The next season, Jackson was suspended for five days on July 18,
1978, after ignoring Martin's instruction to bunt. Five days later,
Martin blasted out at Jackson and Steinbrenner saying, ``One's a
born liar; the other's convicted.'' (Steinbrenner pleaded guilty to
conspiring to violate federal elections laws in a contribution to
Richard Nixon's 1972 campaign. Former President Reagan pardoned him
in January.)
   Martin resigned in tears the next day. Only five days later,
however, Steinbrenner announced he would bring Martin back, a
promise he fulfilled the next year.
   Martin married his fourth wife, the former Jill Guiver, in
January 1988. They had been living on a large farm in Port Crane.
   In an interview in July 1989, Martin said he was enjoying life
out of the spotlight of baseball and the publicity he earned with
numerous barroom altercations.
   ``I have sheep, cattle, ducks, geese and a few horses,'' he
said. ``I like it because we also have an 80-acre lake. I do
everything. I raise pheasants and turn them loose.''
   In his career as a major-league manager, Martin had 1,258
victories and 1,018 losses in 16 seasons. In addition to the
Yankees, he managed the Minnesota, Detroit, Texas and Oakland
teams. He led the Minnesota Twins to an American League West title
in 1969 and the Detroit Tigers to an AL East title in 1970. He led
the Yankees to AL pennants in 1976 and 1977 and the Oakland
Athletics to an AL West title in 1981.
   In 11 major-league seasons as a player, Martin batted .257 with
64 home runs and 333 runs batted in.
   Besides his wife, Martin is survived by a son, Billy Joe, and a
daughter, Kelly, both from previous marriages; two brothers and two
sisters _ Frank Pisani of Vacaville, Calif.; Jack Downey of
Clearlake, Calif.; Patricia Irvine of Berkeley, Calif.; and Joan R.
Holland of Berkeley.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ If New Year's Day seems strangely muted next
week, it may be because an American original is leaving the stage.
David Dinkins becomes New York's first black mayor. But it is
departing Ed Koch who stretched another kind of color line to the
outer limit.

   He goes as he came, possibly the most
effervescent politician of the dying decade.
   To effervesce, Mr. Webster says, is to ``bubble and hiss.'' If
anything, the unretiring retiring mayor of New York now leaves
office after 12 noisy years with more bubble than hiss.
   ``God has been very nice to me,'' Ed Koch concludes, without
suggesting that God ever got a single word in edgewise.
   American leaders cross the bridge from power to private life in
a variety of moods. Ulysses S. Grant worried about money. William
Howard Taft felt like a ``giant locomotive suddenly pulling a toy
train.'' Herbert Hoover and Jimmy Carter felt dejected and rejected.
   Ed Koch was also rejected by the voters but not _ never _ by Ed
Koch. He sounds like the happiest lame duck in the pond.
   He says he no longer feels like Sisyphus of Greek mythology,
trying every day to push a huge boulder up a mountain and every
day, near the top, watching it roll back down.
   ``But now, now I'm crossing over into the promised land!'' he
says, arms akimbo, grinning to his ears, little brown eyes dancing,
bald pate dazzling in the reflected light of a new dawn.
   ``No more decisions. I don't have to alienate anybody. Suddenly
I'm popular again. Maybe it's nostalgia, maybe revisionism is
setting in early. But even the columnists who reviled me unfairly
are saying nice things.
   ``The job of mayor could shorten your life. God extended mine. I
came through that stroke two years ago with no diminution of
faculties. Mother Teresa prayed for my full recovery, and she is a
powerful person.
   ``I am a lucky man. I can sing and dance. I can walk and talk.''
   Encountering no resistance to that last verb, Koch said he was
looking forward to the practice of law, lecturing around the
country, teaching at New York University, writing a column for the
New York Post and doing TV and radio commentary. All in all, he is
expected to avoid the poverty line by about $500,000 a year.
   In a farewell interview with The Associated Press, Koch spoke
warmly of the New York police. During his tenure, he went to 50
police funerals and wept, and as his days in City Hall dwindled
down, he tried to visit every one of the city's police precincts
during shape-up to thank them and say goodbye.
   He told them his plans and offered to help anybody who thought
Koch could be of help as a private citizen. He had pictures taken
with them. Now and then a policeman stepped forward, made a little
sentimental speech and gave the departing mayor a present, like a
sweat shirt.
   Koch leaves a lovely, muted office in a corner of City Hall,
gently decorated with graceful paintings, comfortable furniture and
a restrained number of pictures taken with foreign dignitaries. The
room suggested little connection with the raucous world outside.
Here, the mayor received visitors in shirt sleeves and, usually, in
full gallop.
   The job of mayor of New York is often called the second toughest
in the country. Had this mayor ever thought of going for the
toughest?
   ``No.''
   Not even one teensy passing thought about becoming the first
Jewish president of the United States?
   ``No, no, no. It's never been part of my life's goals. I swear,
it never entered my mind that it was doable. Running for governor
(and losing) was foolish enough.''
   City Hall, he insists, was pinnacle enough, and he leaves ``on a
high,'' proud he was one of only three men to serve three terms,
confident of his place in history, feeling in no way a loser or
ignored. He says Fiorello La Guardia was New York's greatest mayor
but didn't become that in people's minds until years after he
served.
   As for his own record, ``I'm proud of bringing fiscal stability
back to the city, of returning a spirit people had lost when we
felt like beggars under (predecessors) Abe Beame and John Lindsay.
I gave people back a sense of themselves and a sense of humor and a
sense of getting things done.''
   He closes out 25 years of public service as district leader,
city councilman, member of Congress and mayor. Still, he does not
fear decompression leaving power and the march of great events. He
is particularly confident he will not have to fight back tears
leaving reporters.
   He says he took much unfair abuse from the media in the kind of
coverage that keeps good people from running for public office. He
particularly will not miss six columnists he doesn't name who, he
says, wrote with one voice like ``clones of each other.'' He said
they actually took part in political campaigns to defeat him.
   ``Because I'm such a powerful personality, I gave life back to
City Hall, made it relevant again. I exercised the power of an
office that had gone into eclipse. And so I was blamed if a sparrow
fell anywhere in the city.''
   Six large sparrows were convicted of corruption during Koch's
tenure. ``Each was like a dagger in my heart, and I'll never get
over it. In this respect, I think my administration was equal to
the best but we got the worst attacks from the press. In Lindsay's
time, the entire police force was corrupt. One of his commissioners
even sold a reservoir to organized crime.''
   Oh, yes, Koch is doing another book, which reminds him of the
time a Brooklyn rabbi was showing him around. There, the rabbi
pointed, is the biggest library on Jews in the world.
   Koch: Do you have my books?
   Rabbi: Which ones?
   Koch: ``Mayor,'' ``Politics'' and ``His Eminence and Hizzoner''
(written with Cardinal John O'Connor in alternating chapters).
   Rabbi: We'll take the first two.
   Koch: Why not the third?
   Rabbi: You know we can't have his book in our library.
   Koch: You could tell your people to read every other chapter.

   Some advertisers promoting vacation spots
hundreds of miles from Wyoming have the power to move mountains.
   The picturesque Grand Teton and its sister mountains have been
used in ads for Amtrak, which doesn't run through Wyoming; and such
places as a resort in Montana and even a condominium in the heart
of the Rockies in Colorado.
   For the record, the Tetons have been standing firm in
northwestern Wyoming for eons.
   And while imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, the
Jackson Hole Chamber of Commerce isn't happy to see the craggy
peaks plastered on brochures touting destinations that don't have a
view of the range even on a clear day.
   ``The Tetons are one of the most recognizable mountain ranges in
the world and we are more than a little miffed that our competitors
continue to use our assets to promote their areas,'' said Carol
Waller, the chamber's director of marketing. ``We are seriously
considering trademarking the Tetons _ I'm only half-joking.''
   While managers of those out-of-sight resorts responded with
shock or embarrassment when queried about their use of the Tetons,
none offered any apologies. Not even resort managers in Colorado,
which boasts of being home to the greatest skiing in the world.
   Larry Dempsey, general manager of the Crestwood condominium
hotel in Snowmass Village, Colo., just north of Aspen, said he
didn't even realize his magazine advertisement of a skier used the
Tetons as a backdrop.
   No matter, he said, the picture is representative of a winter
ski vacation in the Colorado Rockies _ even if the Tetons are
nearly 400 miles north.
   The ad agency that used the Tetons on the brochure couldn't say
much more than ``oops.''
   ``It was just a case of mistaken identity,'' said Bill Cutting,
of the agency Penna, Powers, Cutting and Haynes of Salt Lake City.
``Believe me, we had no intention of using the Tetons to advertise
a condo project in Aspen.''
   Still, he said, the Tetons do resemble Aspen's Maroon Bells.
   ``When you look at one mountain from 25 different angles, it
would be difficult to tell the difference,'' said Cutting. Besides,
he insisted, no one reading one of the brochures would know the
difference or care much, either.
   Except Waller. She is contacting the resorts to ask them to
retract their advertisements.
   One of those being contacted is the Fairmont Hot Springs Resort
in Gregson, Mont. It uses a brochure with a full view of the nearly
14,000-foot Grand Teton, crown jewel of the Teton range.
``Naturally inviting,'' the cover says.
   Resort Manager Ed Henrich said the Tetons were used when the
marketing company couldn't find any stock photos of Montana's
Pintlar Mountains.
   ``I was totally against it, but we had to get something out on
the market immediately,'' he said. ``No, you cannot see the Tetons
from Montana, but they look an awful lot like the Pintlars.''
   Waller says it's false advertising.
   ``I can't say how much it's hurting us, but we'd rather not
confuse people. They might see the beautiful mountains and wonder
if they are in California, Wyoming, Montana or Colorado. We'd just
like them to know they're in Wyoming,'' she said. ``They're not
portable.''

<HEAD>Humanitarian Aid Arrives in Romania; France Offers to Help Fight</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Romania, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Romania's provisional government thanked those nations who have
sent humanitarian aid to the besieged country and said it would
welcome more.
   The National Salvation Committee, which has set itself up as the
leadership in Romania, said Sunday night that medical assistance,
drugs and food already have arrived from France, the Soviet Union,
Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
   But as offers of aid poured in, East bloc media said few
supplies were able to get through because of the heavy fighting
that continued in the streets.
   In terms of military aid, France's foreign minister offered
Sunday to help put together a ``brigade of volunteers'' to help
Romanians fight security forces loyal to ousted Communist dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu.
   Foreign Minister Roland Dumas said that if the Soviet Union
believed it necessary to intervene in Romania on the side of the
anti-Ceausescu forces, France ``not only would not object to it,
but would support this action.''
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III said the Bush
administration would not object if the Soviets or other Warsaw Pact
nations used their armed forces to assist the anti-Ceausescu forces.
   ``They are attempting to put off the yoke of a very, very
oppressive and repressive dictatorship, so I think that we would be
inclined probably to follow the lead, follow the example of France,
who today has said that if the Warsaw Pact felt it necessary to
intervene on behalf of the opposition that it would support that.''
   Asked directly whether the United States would not object to a
Warsaw Pact military intervention in Romania, where bloody street
fighting has followed the ouster of Ceausescu, Baker said on NBC's
``Meet The Press'': ``That would be my view, yes.''
   There was no indication of imminent military intervention by
Soviet forces. Soviet Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov said Saturday that
sending the Red Army to Romania would be ``impermissible'' and a
repetition of past mistakes.
   Romanian-born playwright Eugene Ionesco, who lives in France,
urged the West ``to provide military aid in arms and ammunition to
the regular Romanian army so it can defend the people against the
agents of the security police.''
   France has sent two planeloads of medical supplies and emergency
medical teams to Romania in a mission led by Bernard Kouchner,
minister for humanitarian action in the Socialist government.
   Romania's Agerpres news agency said the National Salvation
Committee thanked ``all governments that have offered humanitarian
assistance to Romania'' at a time when the people were fighting to
``liquidate the terrorist gangs of the deposed dictator.''
   It added that the provisional government ``welcomes with
gratitude any humanitarian help.''
   Cuba's Radio Reloj reported Sunday night that it had sent blood
plasma and food to Bucharest.
   ``Taking into account the high number of injured people and
victims that have been caused by the recent tragic events in
Romania, the Cuban government has sent humanitarian aid to that
country,'' the report said.

<HEAD>Bush Still Wants to Bring Noriega to Justice</HEAD>

   The hunt for Manuel Antonio Noriega is over,
but President Bush still is searching for ways to bring the
ex-Panamanian dictator to justice even though he is now closeted in
the Vatican ambassador's home, a White House spokesman says.
   Bush learned at Camp David late Sunday afternoon, shortly after
returning from a Pentagon briefing, that Noriega had surfaced
seeking asylum at the residence of the papal nuncio in Panama City
after five days on the run.
   The first reaction from White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
was that Noriega's ``reign of terror is over.''
   But drug-trafficking indictments still hang over Noriega's head,
and U.S. authorities are weighing options for dealing with the
fugitive ex-dictator.
   Under international law, if the Vatican grants Noriega asylum,
U.S. forces cannot legally enter the papal embassy to arrest him.
   ``President Bush is gratified that General Noriega has been
located. ... The president is pleased that `Operation Just Cause'
is on course. The United States will continue to pursue avenues for
bringing General Noriega, now located, to justice,'' Fitzwater said.
   The Italian news agency ANSA quoted the papal nuncio in Panama
City, Monsignor Sebastiano Laboa, as indicating he would not hand
over Noriega to the United States or the new U.S.-backed government
in Panama.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said late Sunday that sources in
Panama told him Noriega ``is seeking to be permitted to leave and
go to one of two or three countries, including Cuba.''
   Sources in Panama familiar with the situation told The
Associated Press that the papal nuncio had mentioned to other
diplomats the possibility of Noriega going to Spain or Cuba.
   Helms said he spoke to White House chief of staff John Sununu,
who ``tells me that they are in strenuous negotiations with the
Vatican, pointing out that he is not there for political reasons.
... I asked him if the prospects look good and he says they don't
look bad, because the church realizes how the people feel in
Panama.''
   Fitzwater said a high-ranking ``Deputies Committee'' led by
deputy national security adviser Robert Gates met Sunday afternoon
and night to discuss the options.
   ``We just can't speculate on any course of action for the
present,'' said Fitzwater. ``We still are pursuing ways to bring
him to justice.''
   Asked if anyone now would get the $1 million reward the United
States had offered for Noriega's capture, Fitzwater said, ``No, I
don't think so.''
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, who traveled to Panama on
Christmas Eve, learned en route that Noriega had sought asylum.
   ``I am delighted that General Noriega has finally been run to
ground,'' he said on arrival at Howard Air Force Base, four miles
west of Panama City.
   ``Now it is up to the lawyers and the diplomats to figure out
what is next,'' Cheney said. ``As far as I'm concerned, the
military has done its job.''
   Earlier, before getting the news, Bush promised stepped up
humanitarian aid for the beleaguered population of Panama City and
praised the performance of the 26,000 U.S. troops there as
``outstanding.''
   Bush had interrupted his own holiday weekend at Camp David, Md.,
to huddle with military chiefs at the Pentagon.
   He also delivered a radio address to U.S. armed forces around
the world, saying Americans possess ``the strength to confront
tyranny when we must. General Noriega is the latest one to learn
that lesson.''
   Bush departed the Pentagon flashing a thumbs-up sign and telling
reporters he sensed ``a real turnaround.''
   Even before Noriega surfaced, Bush and other U.S. officials were
cheered by the return of a semblance of order to Panama City's
streets and the surrender of four of Noriega's top military
commanders.
   Fitzwater said more than 20,000 weapons had been captured and
thousands of other arms turned in by members of the army Noriega
used to lead, the Panama Defense Forces. He said more than 1,000
former PDF soldiers have returned to duty in the country's new
security force. ``Law and order is being successfully restored and
signs of normal commercial life are beginning to emerge,'' said
Fitzwater.
   The shelves of stores across Panama City had been stripped bare
by looters in the lawless days after the Dec. 20 invasion that
toppled Noriega.
   Bush told reporters, ``The emphasis now is on cleaning up the
last parts of resistance, seeing that civilian government takes
over. Tranquility in the city is an important goal.''
   He said American troops are ``now putting a great deal of proper
emphasis on humanitarian concerns,'' including getting food and
medicine to the populace.
   Cheney said earlier Sunday on ABC's ``This Week with David
Brinkley'' that the U.S. forces ``still have a lot of work to do''
to restore order and put down the last resistance in Panama.
   But Noriega's decision to seek asylum removed Bush's biggest
worry: the fear that ``the crafty devil,'' as one U.S. general
called him, might be able to wage a prolonged guerilla war against
U.S. troops and the fledgling government of President Guillermo
Endara.
   Bush was staying at Camp David until Wednesday with his five
children and their families, including 11 grandchildren. He leaves
then for a five-day hunting and fishing trip to Texas and Alabama.
   He also planned to spend part of Sunday, New Year's Eve,
visiting servicemen wounded in Panama at military hospitals in San
Antonio, Texas.
   This Christmas Eve was the 45th anniversary of Bush's own return
home from the Pacific war front as a decorated Navy combat pilot
during World War II.
   Then, as now, he said, there are ``times when America must
sacrifice in the cause of peace.''
   ``In Panama, as in every other such test in our history,
Americans put their lives on the line for the basic values of
liberty and decency on which our nation is founded,'' the president
said.

<TEXT>
   Here, as carried by the Romanian news
agency Agerpres in its own translation, is the text of the
communique issued Sunday by the National Salvation Committee and
read by member Virgil Magureanu:
   The collapse of the hideous dictatorship of the Ceausescu clique
has added the last page to the bloodstained chronicle of the
suffering-filled years the Romanian people had to live. Declasse
and irresponsible elements still loyal to the tyrant have sought to
continue the terrorist practice of the old regime, resorting to
provocations, armed attacks on the civilian population, killing
indiscriminately unarmed people, attacking public institutions,
industrial enterprises, military objectives, trading units,
hospitals and dwellings.
   The Romanian people have once more proved their huge moral
power, released by their liberating will.
   The army have done their duty as have a large part of the staff
of the Ministry of the Interior.
   The revolution has triumphed.
   To the end of bringing the situation back to complete normalcy
and securing our free society, the Council of the Front of National
Salvation has decided to take exceptional measures, imperatively
demanded by the present moment:
   1. Total and immediate cessation of fire throughout the
country's territory. Whoever violates this order is guilty of
crimes against the Romanian people and is liable to be given the
... most merciless punishment. No drop of blood shall be shed any
longer.
   At the same time, any act of vandalism and destruction as well
as personal revenge are illegal and can only impair the nobleness
of our revolution.
   The guilt of the dictator and his former flunkies toward history
and law shall be decided by the court which will pass with all
strictness the punishments deserved for their action of destroying
the country.
   2. The army is the only possessor of weapons, the firm arm
defending the people's interests. All those who in the course of
these days have come into the possession of weapons and ammunition,
irrespective of circumstances, should urgently give them back, the
deadline for this action being Monday, Dec. 25, 5 p.m. All those
failing to comply with this are guilty of serious violation of
legality and shall be punished with utmost harshness.
   3. The units of the Ministry of the Interior shall be integrated
in the Ministry of National Defense which takes over the single
command of all the country's troops and combat means.
   The militia and firemen bodies preserve all their specific
duties which they should exercise with all firmness.
   4. Executives and all working people are called to secure the
protection of economic, commercial, health care, education, science
and cultural units. Romanian society should function normally by
the dedicated contribution of us.
   Likewise, we call on all our country fellows to support the
public order bodies in securing the integrity of the embassy
buildings and the immunity of diplomats.
   5. The bodies of the new structures of democracy should urgently
begin their activity for the country's reconstruction, establishing
themselves with firmness, immediately subordinating themselves to
the council and adopting together with it the political, social,
administrative and economic measures absolutely necessary for the
first stages of reconstruction.
   May the first free New Year bring to Romania, together with the
joy of liberation, the quiet and calm enabling us to assume all
responsibilities of a people asserting its dignity.
   The national consensus, the cooperation of the country's
creative forces, of all the social categories irrespective of
nationality, offer the vital condition and guarantee for the
attainment of the fundamental goals of the revolutionary process in
Romania.

   Two residents and a firefighter were treated for smoke
inhalation at Arlington Memorial Hospital and released.
   ``We feel fortunate there were no other injuries, and the Fire
Department was quick enough to contain the fire,'' said Gary
Anderson, vice president of operations for the nursing home.
   The cause of the fire has not been determined, officials said.

   Third World countries, though struggling with
poverty, violence and debt, have made big strides in schooling
their children and prolonging people's lives in recent years,
according to figures assembled by the World Bank.
   The World Bank is the biggest source of aid loans to the Third
World. It collects data on 185 countries and territories in ``The
World Bank Atlas.'' The 1989 edition was published recently.
   Take Sri Lanka, the island republic off the coast of India, torn
by ethnic conflict among a population with an average income of
only $420 a year.
   Between 1970 and 1988, the country increased life expectancy for
newborn children from 64 to 71 years, not far from this country's
75 years.
   The number of children a Sri Lankan mother could expect to have
dropped to 2.6 in 1988 from 4.3 in 1970. Reducing the size of the
future population is important in a country that crowds more than
16 million people into an area smaller than the state of Maine.
   By 1986, the date of the most recent figures, 84 percent of Sri
Lankan children were in school, up from 71 percent in 1970.
   India too, a country much more populous than Sri Lanka and even
poorer, had built schools for 60 percent of its children in 1986,
compared with 49 percent in 1970. Parents of an Indian baby born
last year could expect it to live until age 55 _ instead of only 48
in 1970.
   Between 1965 and 1986, food supplies went down in some of the
poorest areas _ Ethiopia, Chad, Zaire and Nigeria, Africa's most
populous country. But many of the 42 areas in the bank's ``low
income'' group showed an increase in food supplies, including
Indonesia, Nepal, Laos, Malawi and Tanzania.
   The average Indonesian, for example, had a daily average of only
1,800 calories available in 1965. By 1986, that had risen to 2,579
calories, though the average citizen was earning only $500 a year.
Americans have an average daily supply of 3,645 calories.
   Even Africa has progress to show, though incomes have gone down
in many countries since they emerged from colonial rule in the
1960s. Togo, for example, claimed to have 78 percent of its girls
in elementary school in 1986, up from only 32 percent in 1965. Togo
got its independence from France in 1960. Incomes have been
dropping throughout the 1980s, averaging $370 last year.
   In 1965, Togo had one physician for 23,240 people. Yet by 1984,
the average had improved to one doctor for 8,720 people. That was a
long way from this country's 470 prospective patients per doctor,
but still a considerable improvement.
   Many Latin Americans are especially proud of progress in
education, although otherwise they speak of the 1980s as a ``lost
decade.'' Incomes have declined in many areas, wealthy citizens
have sent much of their wealth abroad and the burden of foreign
debt has increased greatly.
   For instance, a poor country like Bolivia was educating 87
percent of its children in primary school in 1986 _ 93 percent of
the boys and 82 percent of the girls _ compared with 73 percent in
1965. It also increased the number of young people in higher
education, to 19 percent from 5 percent.
   Countries where women traditionally have been at a disadvantage
were giving them more education. The number of girls in secondary
schools rose from 5 percent in 1965 to 27 percent in 1986 in
Morocco, and from 15 percent to 54 percent in Egypt in the same
time span.

   Christmas Eve fires killed at least 46 people in seven states
Sunday, including 12 people at a Tennessee retirement home, six
people at a family reunion in Atlanta, and a mother and four
daughters in a Dallas suburb.
   Five other fires had tragic consequences in Pennsylvania, New
York, New Hampshire and Wisconsin.
   Four members of a Pittsburgh family died and eight others,
including a pregnant woman, were injured. In Little Falls, N.Y., a
man tried in vain to save his wife and three children from a fire
that destroyed their trailer home.
   A mother and her two sons died in an early-morning blaze that
gutted their West Conshohocken, Pa., rowhouse; four people died in
an early morning bungalow fire in Swan Lake, N.Y.; and three
children died and their mother was seriously injured in an
apartment fire in Manchester, N.H.
   A 6-year-old boy died of smoke inhalation in Milwaukee when a
fire broke out in a bedroom in his apartment, and a 45-year-old
schoolteacher died when the torch he was using to thaw water in a
pipe apparently started a fire that destroyed a shed behind house
trailers he owned in Ashland, Wis.
   In Johnson City, Tenn., fire broke out at the 10-story John
Sevier Retirement Center around 5:30 p.m. and firefighters were
still battling it nearly six hours later, officials said.
Authorities said at least 14 people died and more deaths were
expected.
   At least 26 people were injured. About 145 people lived at the
center.
   The Atlanta fire gutted a one-story wood frame home, leaving
relatives who gathered for the reunion stricken, grieving and
homeless.
   ``We were all there for a family Christmas. Now, five of my
relatives are dead, and the others lost everything,'' said family
member Juanita McColumn. ``They ran out with just their night
clothes on, and they have no clothes and nowhere to stay.''
   Ms. McColumn identified the dead as LaVerne Willis, 30, her
sister; Latoya Willis, 6, Ms. Willis' daughter; Xavier Wilson, 4, a
nephew; Ernestine Strozier, 28 and her son, David, 8, both cousins
of the Willises; and Leroy Bain, 37, LaVerne Willis' boyfriend. All
lived in Atlanta.
   The fire lasted about two hours, said Sgt. C.A. Graham of the
Fulton County medical examiner's office. The cause was not known,
Graham said.
   In the Dallas suburb of Garland, a 31-year-old mother and four
daughters, ages 2 to 9, died when a fire that apparently began
around a Christmas tree engulfed their home.
   The woman's husband and two sons escaped the fire, officials
said.
   ``The firefighters were unable to get into the house to locate
anyone, the fire was so intense,'' said Ron Smith of the Garland
Fire Department.
   In Pittsburgh, fire tore through a home at 5:45 a.m., killing
Clarence Blakemore, 60, his 26-year-old daughter, and two
grandchildren, ages 2 and 4.
   Eight other Blakemore relatives were injured. Two were in
critical condition and three were in serious condition, including a
23-year-old woman who was eight months pregnant.
   The fire in Little Falls consumed Robert E. Thomas' trailer home
in a matter of minutes, state police said. Thomas struggled to save
his family through a rear door, but his 27-year-old wife and their
three sons, ages 2 to 6, died.
   ``He thought he kept hearing (son) Robby's voice calling `Daddy'
through the door. He kept yelling `Help me, help me get my babies
out!''' next-door neighbor Theresa Gressler said.
   In Swan Lake, four people died when a propane heater apparently
exploded around 3:30 a.m., destroying their bungalow, state Trooper
Mark Brown said. The four, all Brazilians, could not be identified
immediately, Brown said.
   Another Sunday morning fire in a single-family home in the
Albany, N.Y., suburb of Watervliet claimed one man's life, police
said.
   Fire officials in West Conshohocken, Pa., believe Sevilla Smith,
27, died while trying to save her two children, aged 15 months and
5 years, from a fire in their three-story home shortly after 3:30
a.m.
   In Manchester, N.H., two boys and a girl, ages 2 to 5, were
killed in their apartment in a three-story wood building, said
police Lt. James Stewart. Their mother, Jessica Lunderville, 30,
was hospitalized in critical condition Sunday night. Stewart said
the father and two other children were not home at the time.
   Also in Manchester, firefighters Sunday afternoon rescued 26
elderly nuns from a fire at a convent nursing home. The fire was
caused by an electrical malfunction at the Nativity scene in the
convent's chapel, said Manchester Police Chief Francis Monnelly.
Two nuns suffered smoke inhalation and were hospitalized in
satisfactory condition.

   A top Soviet official rules out military
intervention in Romania, but Secretary of State James A. Baker III
says the Bush administration would not object if Soviet troops
helped revolutionaries battling loyalists to deposed communist
despot Nicolae Ceausescu.
   Romanians are ``attempting to put off the yoke of a very, very
oppressive and repressive dictatorship, so I think that we would be
inclined probably to follow the lead, follow the example of France,
who today has said that if the Warsaw Pact felt it necessary to
intervene on behalf of the opposition, that it would support
that,'' Baker said Sunday on the NBC-TV program ``Meet the Press.''
   Dutch government officials also said they would not oppose
Soviet or Warsaw Pact military intervention if it would ``support
the aspirations of the Romanian people.''
   However, Soviet Premier Nikolai I. Ryshkov said Saturday that
sending the Red Army to Romania would be ``impermissible'' and a
repetition of past mistakes.
   U.S. officials by late Sunday detected no sign of foreign
intervention in Romania, where fierce fighting continued between
Ceausescu backers and the National Salvation Committee, said
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.
   ``It is obviously our hope that the pro-reform forces will win,
but it's still a very hairy situation, a great deal of violence,
and I would think that the outcome is probably still in doubt,''
Cheney said on the ABC-TV program ``This Week With David Brinkley.''
   ``We haven't seen any sign of any outside intervention,'' said
Cheney.
   President Bush, speaking briefly to reporters in Washington,
said the British ambassador to Romania took refuge in the U.S.
Embassy in Bucharest because his embassy was destroyed.
   ``The British Embassy was razed and so the British ambassador is
now our guest, I understand. So that has been a very traumatic
pre-Christmas uprising,'' Bush said after speaking by telephone
with the U.S. ambassador to Bucharest, Alan Green.
   The French offered to send volunteers to fight for Romania's
National Salvation Committee. Baker, asked whether America was
prepared to send U.S. troops into Romania, said any such decision
would rest with Bush.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters later,
``We don't have any indication that there is a chance of the
Soviets' going in, at least not at this time. So we don't expect
that to occur.''
   Asked about Baker's comment, Fitzwater added: ``We could see a
situation that might be severe enough where there'd be a need to
help establish law and order.'' But he said that it ``certainly is
not necessary now and does not appear to be necessary.''
   Baker said U.S. officials were in contact with the
revolutionaries but he declined to give specifics.
   ``We've had some discussions with representatives of the new
group and we've been encouraging in our comments and frankly we
would like to see this be resolved in as peaceful a fashion as
possible, but we think it is important that there be a move toward
freedom and greater political pluralism in Romania,'' Baker said.

   A state of emergency was declared Sunday in Florida because of
the record cold wave, which stranded travelers and overloaded power
plants and gave parts of the South their first white Christmas in
more than a century.
   Snow drifts stood up to 8 feet high in South Carolina, and
Wilmington, N.C., recorded its greatest snowfall ever _ at least 15
inches. The blizzard caused a 600-foot Navy tanker to run aground
on North Carolina's Outer Banks.
   But warmer weather moved eastward with temperatures hitting 40
at Chamberlain, S.D., and Minneapolis warmed into the 20s after
nearly five straight days below zero. Kansas City, Mo., had a
December record of 16 below zero Saturday, but highs in the 30s and
40s were predicted in the region Monday.
   Temperatures also rebounded into the low 50s in Texas, but
temperatures as low as 11 degrees over the weekend devastated the
lower Rio Grande Valley's citrus crop, and forecasters predicted
more freezing weather on Christmas Day.
   ``It's going to take probably weeks and maybe months to
determine how much damage we've had,'' said Richard Hensz, director
of the Texas A&amp;I University Citrus Center in Weslaco. ``But it's
very extensive.''
   At 5 a.m. Sunday, the wind chill at Orlando, Fla., was about 5
below zero compared with 5 above at Minneapolis-St. Paul, the
National Weather Service said.
   At least 83 deaths have been blamed on the weather since Dec. 15
from the Plains to the East Coast.
   Florida Gov. Bob Martinez declared a state of emergency Sunday
as even Miami plunged to 31 degrees. The cold damaged citrus, sugar
cane and strawberries, stranded holiday travelers and forced
utilities to impose rolling blackouts.
   Record lows were recorded Sunday in nearly every major Florida
city, from 11 in Pensacola to 44 at Key West, where the previous
record of 47 had stood since 1906.
   Records were reported in 56 cities in Alabama, Arkansas,
Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine,
Mississippi, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, Tennessee,
Texas, Vermont, Virginia, and West Virginia, the weather service
said.
   Authorities at Plattsburgh, N.Y., spent part of Sunday working
to blast open ice jams on the Saranac River that caused flooding
that forced more than 120 people from their homes at a trailer
park. The city near the Canadian border had a low of 19 below zero.
   Martinez overnight mobilized National Guardsmen and other state
workers to rescue motorists from gridlocked, icy highways. With
many motels packed, emergency shelters were opened in six northern
Florida counties and 5,200 people spent the night in them,
officials said.
   ``There is no one smiling in Florida agriculture today,'' said
Roy Parke of Parkesdale Farms in Plant City, self-proclaimed winter
strawberry capital of the nation.
   The airport for Wilmington, N.C., was shut down by snow Saturday
morning and remained closed Sunday. Snow also closed the airport at
Myrtle Beach, S.C.
   In Florida, the Jacksonville and Gainesville airports remained
closed because of icy runways Sunday. Air service was nearly back
to normal in Tallahassee and Daytona Beach after numerous
cancellations Saturday.
   The North Carolina coast got the most snow Sunday. At least 15
inches fell at Wilmington, eclipsing the city's all-time record of
12{ inches on Feb. 9 and 10, 1973.
   The Hyde County, N.C., sheriff's department reported drifts of 6
to 8 feet. Only large, dual-wheel trucks were able to travel, and
some of them got stuck.
   Wind blowing at 50 to 60 mph on the Outer Banks islands off
North Carolina knocked down power lines as fast as utility crews
could get them back up. Three beach cottages were tossed into the
ocean.
   It'll be the first white Christmas in Wilmington since 1870 and
on the Outer Banks since 1874, the weather service said.
   Early Sunday, the tow line between a tugboat and the Navy tanker
Benjamin Isherwood broke or came off, said Lt. Cmdr. Stephen
Burnett. The vessel drifted until about 4:30 p.m., when it ran
aground, Burnett said.
   Naval officials said the vessel carried no fuel and no injuries
were reported.
   Along the South Carolina coast, the resort town of Myrtle Beach
had 14 inches of snow on the ground Sunday and 8 inches blanketed
streets in Charleston.
   ``I just moved up from Florida in time for (Hurricane) Hugo, and
now this,'' said Rick Hawkins in Charleston. ``Isn't it lovely?
It's a mess.''
   In Florida, Parke of Parkesdale Farms said he expected 40
percent losses. The state's winter strawberry crop is worth some
$162 million.
   ``Significant'' damage was reported to Florida's $3.5 billion
citrus crop and possible damage to the $1.6 billion sugar industry,
Martinez said. The governor's emergency declaration authorized the
state Department of Transportation to loosen weight restrictions on
roads and bridges to help growers move freeze-damaged crops quickly.
   Not everyone complained. ``This is nice. It's not Christmas
without some cold,'' said Louis Dussault of Montreal, strolling
Miami Beach on Sunday with his wife and two children. The city in
Canada had a low of 6 below zero.
   Florida utilities, faced with high demand for electricity,
called for conservation and said there was no excess power to be
bought from frigid Northern states, meaning rotating blackouts
would be imposed for many Floridians through Christmas morning.
   Snow dusted some northern Florida cities, such as Jacksonville,
where icicles hung Sunday morning from rooftops and ice closed
roads and bridges.
   ``It's a winter wonderland in Jacksonville,'' said Mayor Tommy
Hazouri. ``It's a beautiful sight for a city that doesn't get snow
very often, and it's also a dangerous situation for the same
reason.''
   ``They can take it back,'' grumbled resident Randy Dukes. ``I
want a green Christmas.''

   Each month Jim Barclay's robot, Toby,
receives a love letter full of yearning from a mysterious
girlfriend as she travels the country.
   Nobody has seen the girlfriend called Jodi, but her letters
arrive about once a month bearing postmarks from all over.
Sometimes she even takes the robot along.
   Barclay, a practical joker himself, doesn't know who's behind
the elaborate scheme that began with the robot's arrival last
Christmas at the Rea Clinic in this southern Illinois town of 3,000.
   ``I don't want to know whose doing it,'' he said. ``I'm having a
ball out of it.''
   Barclay, a printer and maintenance worker at the clinic, said he
came to work one morning and found the foot-high, gold-toned,
plastic robot in his chair.
   An accompanying note read: ``Jim, maybe Toby can work the second
shift and help catch up. Santa.''
   Barclay said his wife, Margene, and each of the clinic's 50
employees denied any involvement. So began the string of 19 love
letters, gifts and even Toby's temporary disappearance.
   Every month to six weeks, another card comes to the clinic for
Toby, Barclay said.
   ``When we get a card everybody at the clinic gets excited,''
Barclay said recently.
   The letters have come from as far away as Eagle, Colo., and
Tampa, Fla.
   ``That one we got from Florida, it was a tear-jerker. I sat here
and tears came to my eyes. He was standing over there doing
nothing,'' Barclay said, nodding in Toby's direction in mock
disgust.
   Toby walks and plays a programmed message but doesn't do much
else around the shop, Barclay said.
   The postmarks give clues about Jodi's travels, but the gifts and
disappearances have confused him.
   Barclay came to work one morning and Toby was gone, replaced by
a note saying the robot was with Jodi. A week later, Barclay
arrived at work to find Toby back along with a note saying the
robot and Jodi had enjoyed a trip to Wisconsin. Wisconsin cheese in
the refrigerator was for Barclay, the note said.
   The intrigue continued in September when Jodi and Toby took off
to Wausau, Wis., and spent a week at the Marshfield Clinic, a
regional rural health center, Barclay said.
   When Toby reappeared, he was accompanied by a note from a Dr.
Paul Stamer declaring the robot to be in fine health.
   But employees at the health clinic said Stamer doesn't exist,
Barclay said.
   As Christmas approached, the Barclays nearly decided to take
Toby home because of concerns that Jodi would take him away for
good during the holiday weekend. They decided against it.
   ``We don't want to interfere with their love life,'' Barclay
said.
   Their trust was rewarded.
   In a Christmas card with the usual confessions of love from Jodi
and a message for Barclay to look in an old car at his home.
   Inside the car was a plaster elephant painted gold _ Barclay
collects toy elephants _ and a 15-pound ham with a tag wishing the
couple Merry Christmas from Jodi and Toby.

<TEXT>
   President Bush welcomed news that Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega had sought asylum at the Vatican mission in Panama
City, declaring on Christmas Eve that the deposed dictator's
``reign of terror is over.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said top Bush
administration deputies were meeting into the night at the White
House ``considering an appropriate course of action for bringing
him to justice.''
   U.S. military officers, meanwhile, hoped Noriega's action would
``take the spirit to resist'' out of loyalists still fighting in
Panama, said a Pentagon spokesman, Col. Miguel Monteverde. He said
it was not clear whether the development would hasten the
withdrawal of U.S. troops.
   Under international law, diplomatic missions are safe havens for
those seeking asylum and Noriega is not the only prominent figure
to take advantage of this convention. Since June, Chinese dissident
Fang Lizhi has kept Chinese authorities at bay by taking refuge in
the U.S. Embassy in Beijing.
   While Fitzwater said the administration wants to bring Noriega
to justice, he declined to say whether that would involve a U.S.
effort to gain custody of the general, who is under indictment in
the United States on drug trafficking charges.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said White House chief of staff John
Sununu told him ``strenuous negotiations'' with the Vatican were
ongoing.
   U.S. officials are ``pointing out that (Noriega) is not there
for political reasons, he is, as Sununu told me, a common
criminal,'' Helms told The Associated Press.
   ``I asked him if the prospects look good and he says they don't
look bad, because the church realizes how the people feel in
Panama,'' Helms said.
   Helms said ``sources in Panama say that he (Noriega) probably
went in with the escort of a diplomat. He is seeking to be
permitted to leave and go to one of two or three counties,
including Cuba.''
   Earlier, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney had said it was uncertain
whether the United States would seek to try Noriega or whether the
new government in Panama would deal with him.
   The Italian news agency ANSA quoted the papal nuncio in Panama
City, Monsignor Sebastiano Laboa, as indicating he would not hand
over Noriega to the United States or the U.S.-installed government
in Panama.
   Noriega's lawyer in Miami, Raymond Takiff, said Sunday that
Noriega's action surprised him: ``I was sure he'd die in Panama.''
   U.S. inability to capture Noriega had become a sore point for
the administration, which earlier Sunday fended off criticism that
civil order in Panama was being undermined by his continued freedom.
   Bush was at the presidential retreat at Camp David when he got
word Sunday afternoon of Noriega's request for asylum at the
Vatican mission. In Washington, press secretary Marlin Fitzwater
said on behalf of Bush: ``We have been notified by the papal nuncio
in Panama City that General Noriega has turned himself in at their
embassy.''
   ``I am pleased that the general is now under the control of
diplomatic authorities. His reign of terror is over,'' said the
statement. ``As we work to help return law and order to Panama
City, and as the government of President (Guillermo) Endara begins
its work, the demise of General Noriega sends a strong signal that
freedom and democracy in Panama are on the rise.''
   Earlier Sunday, Bush had traveled to the Pentagon for a briefing
on Panama developments, and he dispatched Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney to Panama City just hours before Noriega's asylum bid was
disclosed.
   Archbishop Marcos McGrath of Panama City, asked by CBS-TV why
Noriega went to the Vatican mission, said, ``Apparently he decided
that the moment had come to end his resistance. And he made
contacts by telephone and drove in a private car and walked into
the Papal Nuncio's residence and thereby entered into an area of
diplomatic immunity.''
   ``Apparently he went in alone and he would be out of the area of
arrest either by the Panamanian government authorities or any
action of the U.S. military,'' the Roman Catholic archbishop said.
   Under diplomatic tradition, Noriega is safe from arrest as long
as he remains inside the diplomatic mission, or until agreement is
reached on terms for him to leave the area of immunity.
   At the State Department's Panama Task Force, Richard Sanders
said administration officials had not decided whether to take steps
to bring Noriega to the United States.
   Putting Noriega on trial poses risks to the United States.
Noriega formerly had an association with the Central Intelligence
Agency and might be in a position to disclose embarrassing details
of that relationship. In defending himself for trial, he could seek
to use classified documents in his defense.
   U.S. military officials had anticipated that Noriega might seek
diplomatic sanctuary, and on Thursday troops were sent to ring the
Panama City embassies of Nicaragua and Cuba.
   Top administration officials discussed the Panama invasion on
television interview shows Sunday, acknowledging that the 24,000
U.S. soldiers now there ``still have a lot of work to do'' to
restore order.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Cheney defended the
administration against criticism it had not acted quickly enough to
quell looting in Panama City after U.S. troops invaded early
Wednesday.
   U.S. forces initially concentrated on military targets, but are
now working more with Endara's government to restore order, Cheney
said on ABC's ``This Week with David Brinkley.''
   ``The looting is dying out,'' said Cheney. He acknowledged that
some pro-Noriega paramilitary forces, known as ``Dignity
Battalions,'' were ``running loose in the streets, but the
situation appears to be steadily improving.''
   ``It's not all over yet,'' he said. ``We still have a lot of
work to do, but clearly we are in better shape today than at any
point since the effort started.''
   In a broadcast to U.S. Armed Forces around the world, Bush said
America ``has the strength to confront tyranny when we must. Gen.
Noriega is the latest to learn that lesson.''
   Bush told reporters outside the Pentagon that ``the emphasis now
is on cleaning up the last parts of resistance, seeing that
civilian government take over, (restoring) tranquility in the city
and then moving on food and medicine.''
   Baker, appearing on the NBC-TV program ``Meet the Press,''
reiterated the administration position that the U.S. troops will
remain in Panama ``as long as it takes to get the job done.''
   The Pentagon's casualty figures stood at 24 U.S. servicemen
killed in action, 284 wounded, and two civilian dependents killed.
Earlier, Pentagon officials had said 25 U.S. servicemen died, but
later reported that they had been counting one death twice.
   Casualties for the Panamanian Defense Forces were 154 killed,
113 wounded and 2,969 captured, the Pentagon reported.
Additionally, about 18,000 weapons had been captured.
   Official tallies of Panamanian civilian casualties were
unavailable, but the Air Force said a C-5 cargo plane loaded with
medical supplies was sent from South Carolina to help treat injured
civilians.

<HEAD>Economic Tailspin Forces Budget Cuts in Maine</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Barely a year ago state taxpayers were
cashing pre-holiday rebate checks worth nearly $42 million. But
with the Northeast's economy in a tailspin, Maine officials face
spending cuts of half again that much.
   While the officials say they hope to avoid any serious
disruption in existing services or layoffs of state workers, they
acknowledge it otherwise may be impossible to achieve a $67 million
reduction through mid-1991.
   The targeted amount represents 2 percent of the state's
two-year, $3.2 billion budget, which by law must be balanced.
   ``To assume that we can cut this level of dollars without some
impact on services, I think, is unrealistic,'' state Finance
Commissioner H. Sawin Millett said last week. ``Sooner or later,
you get into programs.''
   Heads of state departments and agencies have until Tuesday to
propose the initial round of cuts for the rest of the fiscal year
that started July 1.
   Gov. John R. McKernan, who also has expanded a partial hiring
freeze and called for cutbacks in state employees' travel as part
of the new austerity policy, is expected to make the final
decisions by mid-January and present a budget-reduction bill to the
Legislature by the end of the month.
   McKernan has ruled out any increase in the state income or sales
taxes.
   State executives said it's too early to specify what cuts would
be proposed.
   ``We're all scrambling,'' said Robert L. Woodbury, chancellor of
the seven-campus University of Maine system.
   ``At this point, nothing is sacred,'' said Human Services
Commissioner H. Rollin Ives, whose department administers most
social-service programs. ``The last thing I want to do is cut
essential, existing services.''
   The pending cuts come in response to a sharp downturn in the
economy that has caused budget problems of varying degrees for
other states throughout the Northeast, following several years of
robust growth in the mid-1980s. That growth generated such a
windfall in Maine's income-tax revenue that lawmakers voted last
fall to return nearly $42 million in an election-year rebate.
   Among the states worst off now is Massachusetts, which faces a
fiscal year 1990 budget deficit that the administration of Gov.
Michael S. Dukakis estimates at more than $800 million. Dukakis has
urged a tax increase by the end of the year, but that prospect
appears unlikely as lawmakers approach the end of this year's
session, and the budget debate is expected to spill over into next
year's Legislature.
   In New Hampshire, Gov. Judd Gregg is forecasting a shortfall of
$30 million to $50 million. Gregg imposed a hiring freeze in
October and is working with lawmakers to pare state spending by
about $18 million for the biennium.
   McKernan's call for spending cuts in Maine resulted from the
second reduction this year in his administration's projections of
sales-tax revenues, following a review of state finances by an
outside accounting firm.
   The consultant concluded that the money generated by the 5
percent state sales tax, which is second only to the individual
income tax in the amount of revenue generated, should continue to
grow in the months ahead but that the increases would be much
smaller than anticipated. Sluggish sales of motor vehicles and
building supplies have been cited as the chief reasons.
   The governor ordered department heads to recommend spending cuts
equal to 5 percent of their discretionary income for the six months
left in this fiscal year and to revise their fiscal 1991 budgets to
eliminate any growth.
   Those proposals are expected to yield about $94 million in
potential cuts, administration officials have said.
   Some agencies are expected to be affected more than others,
because McKernan has pledged to preserve critical services,
particularly those provided through the departments of Mental
Health, Corrections and Human Services, as much as possible.
   The administration's consultant, Washington-based Peat Marwick
Main &amp; Co., has been contracted to help state officials devise a
more reliable economic model to use in forecasting revenues.
   ``Clearly, we'll be in better shape when we build the next
budget,'' said Finance Commissioner Millett.

<HEAD>Vatican Dilemma: What To Do With Noriega</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While it's not the first time a political
figure has sought refuge in a Vatican embassy, Roman Catholic
officials faced a unique dilemma when Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
showed up at the papal nunciate in Panama.
   Helping the strongman flee the country would likely pique the
United States, which invaded Panama last week to try to capture the
strongman and bring him to trial on drug charges.
   At the same time, the Vatican would not be eager to hand him
over to U.S. authorities for fear of appearing to condone the
invasion and take sides in an international dispute.
   ``It's a very complex problem,'' said a senior Vatican official
early today after learning that Noriega took refuge Sunday at the
papal nunciate, or Vatican embassy, in Panama City.
   The official, who works in foreign policy issues and spoke under
the usual ground rule of anonymity, noted that the Vatican has no
tradition or policy of accepting asylum seekers.
   ``The Vatican policy is `we're not open to taking people, we
can't take them back to the Vatican.' The Vatican needs to
negotiate with a third government to take them. This is much more
difficult,'' the official said.
   The official said the Vatican mission could seek to turn Noriega
over to the new Panama government or to arrange for safe passage to
another country.
   ``I don't think they could directly hand Noriega over to the
Americans, who are an invading army,'' the official said. ``They
would be recognizing the Americans as the local authorities.
Instead, they could hand him over to the government there on
condition of a fair trial.''
   The official said Noriega may have chosen to take refuge at the
Vatican embassy because he feels it offers the most guarantees and
is the one mission whose diplomatic immunity the United States
would not want to violate.
   Just two months ago, the Vatican embassy in Panama had sheltered
opposition leader Guillermo Endara after he was beaten by Noriega's
soldiers. Endara was later installed as president after the U.S.
invasion.
   In 1983, four Marxist guerrillas sought refuge at the Vatican
mission in Santiago, Chile, after they were accused by Chilean
authorities in the assassination of retired Army Gen. Carol Urzua,
the governor of metropolitan Santiago.
   The Holy See arranged for their safe conduct out of the country
on grounds they would have faced summary judgment in Chile by an
army war tribunal.
   Another case of political refuge involving the Vatican was that
of the late Hungarian Cardinal Josef Mindszenty, who was convicted
of treason in 1949 in what was widely regarded as a rigged trial.
   Mindszenty was freed from prison by Hungarian revolutionaries in
1956 and took refuge in the U.S. mission in Budapest when Soviet
tanks crushed the uprising. He left his asylum in 1971 under an
agreement with the Vatican and died in Vienna in 1975.
   Pope John Paul II and the local Roman Catholic Church have
expressed concern about the U.S. military intervention in Panama.
On Friday, the pope said ``there have been clashes with innocent
victims and grave discomforts to the population.''

<TEXT>
   A wave of cheers roared through the
streets of the city as Panamanians, facing a grim Christmas,
learned Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega had surfaced and was seeking
political asylum.
   Some found it hard to believe Noriega had gone to the Vatican
mission Sunday afternoon. But when the report was confirmed,
elation ruled in besieged Panama City.
   ``Now we can have Christmas,'' said one man, who grabbed a
friend and hugged him. ``I don't have a turkey in the house, we
don't even have any hamburger. All we have is a can of sardines,
but what the hell.''
   People banged pots, cheered and honked horns as they drove up
and down streets, which were barricaded and still littered and
smoldering after days of looting.
   ``The man has fallen! He is gone!'' exclaimed two young men who
said they heard the report on the radio.
   ``Attention people of Panama. Attention people of Panama,'' said
one excited radio announcer. ``There is a report that Noriega has
turned himself in. If that's true, there is a fat man that is going
to be very happy tonight.''
   He was referring to newly-installed President Guillermo Endara.
   At the Vatican embassy, a throng of people soon amassed and grew
by the minute as the sun went down over the Panama City waterfront.
   For many, the news provided a release for their hate.
   ``Let's go lynch that son of a bitch,'' yelled a group of young
men in a car.
   Another group smashed a pineapple with their shoes and cursed
``pineapple face,'' as the hated dictator was often called because
of his pockmarked face.
   The capital of 1 million had faced a bleak Christmas. Days of
looting stripped stores bare, and there was a shortage of food and
items to buy for presents.
   ``Happy holidays to the people of Panama,'' said a European
ambassador who was visiting the embassy. He asked not to be further
identified.
   ``Mission accomplished,'' said a passing cab driver. ``That
coward.''
   ``Is it true?'' a woman asked people from her balcony. She
squealed with joy when told it was.
   Although there were 26,000 U.S. military personnel in Panama
trying to find the general, an informed military source said
Noriega drove himself or was driven through the city to the embassy
in an upper class shorefront neighborhood and entered the building
alone.
   There were no U.S. troops around the two-story building and
garden that occupy half a city block when Noriega arrived at about
3 p.m.
   Since the U.S. invasion last Wednesday sent Noriega into hiding,
U.S. soldiers have surrounded the Cuban, Libyan and Nicaraguan
embassies in the belief Noriega would seek refuge in one of those
countries.
   After it was reported that Noriega was inside the Vatican
embassy, armored cars and dozens paratroopers ringed the site as a
helicopter hovered overhead. The crowd of several hundred was kept
100 yards from the site.
   Newscasters issued calls on television for people to stay inside
their homes and not take part in demonstrations because they might
get in the way of U.S. troops still looking for Noriega loyalists.
   The broadcasts reminded people that a curfew began at 6 p.m.
Although the curfew has been widely ignored, the crowd began slowly
to disperse after sunset.

   The Romanian faithful today are
celebrating the Christmas miracle that freed them from a Communist
dictator who trampled religious freedoms and even kept Christmas
music off the radio.
   ``There were so many years when I did not come to church for
fear of the government,'' said one worshiper, Victoria Ionita, on
Christmas Eve. ``Now there is shooting in the streets, but I come
because of trust in God.''
   Christmas music rang out Sunday throughout Romania for the first
time since Communists took over in 1947.
   But fighting raged on between soldiers backing the provisional
government and security forces loyal to dictator Nicolae Ceausescu,
who was ousted in a popular uprising Friday and later arrested.
   A few families carried freshly cut Christmas trees through
Bucharest early Sunday, but sniper fire by Ceausescu supporters
quickly cleared the streets.
   For many Romanians, Ceausescu's downfall was a Christmas miracle
from St. Dimitrius, the 12th century holy man whose relics lay in
the gilded and frescoed cathedral the deposed dictator wanted to
destroy.
   ``This was a painful re-enactment of the Bible,'' said Patriarch
Teoctist, the gray-bearded pontiff of Romania's Orthodox Church.
``Ceausescu was a follower of Herod, and when Herod was seeking
Jesus Christ he ordered the killing of many thousands of children.''
   On Oct. 26, the eve of St. Dimitrius Day, churchmen prayed for
the overthrow of Ceausescu. It came, they said, as an answer to
that prayer.
   ``Everybody believes that,'' said Teoctist, with a sly smile.
``Don't forget, we are believers.''
   Outside the cathedral, old couples and young men lighted candles
and bowed. A woman in a green coat, Letitia Patrut, spoke of
students slain during the uprising who would miss Christmas.
   ``These young people, how they sacrificed for us!'' she said.
``We must pray for these poor young people who defended the
people.''
   One woman was so badly shaken she paused long moments between
words. She had fasted since Friday night in sympathy for the
victims. To emphasize her point, she fished from her pockets two
bullets she had dug from her wall.
   Patriarch Teoctist said Romanians have remained a deeply
religious people despite political adversity.
   He said 85 percent to 90 percent of Romanians are Orthodox
Christians and that he was encouraged by how many people came to
church during the dictatorship.
   ``Freedom of religion is indescribably important. Romanians
lived all these years with their church, and now they realize how
they escaped from a nightmare,'' the patriarch said.
   He said Ceausescu wanted to destroy the partriarchal residence
and possibly even the cathedral. ``Every day I feared I would wake
up and someone would tell me the bulldozers were coming.''

   Though the Christmas trees and bright
faces of loved ones may have been missing, the 26,000 U.S. soldiers
occupying Panama on Christmas Day had a lot to be thankful for:
they were alive.
   A few even managed to gloat. ``I was freezing to death on Pope
Air Force Base (in North Carolina) five days ago,'' one said at the
former home of the ousted Panamanian strongman, Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega. ``Now I'm eating off Noriega's china.''
   However, 21-year-old Sgt. Ernie Nieto, said, ``I'm just glad to
see Christmas. The other night (in combat) I just wanted to see
sunup.''
   He spoke at the fire-blackened ruins of Panamanian Defense
Forces headquarters, destroyed in the early hours of the invasion.
   Nieto's tour of duty in Panama was up the day before the United
States invaded Dec. 20, and he had planned on a Christmas at home
in Albuquerque, N.M.
   Instead, he was in a gutted building.
   At the home of Noriega, two squads from the 82nd Airborne
Division munched the modern version of K-rations a few yards from
the deposed dictator's lavish Christmas tree.
   For the men on guard at the gate, there were soft drinks and
cheers from Noriega's neighbors.
   ``Do you need anything? Do you want some ice?'' Ana Julia Real
asked as she handed four quart bottles of Coca-Cola over the high
stone wall.
   ``Merry Christmas!'' a man called as he passed.
   E4 Greg Frye of Daltona, Fla., passed the sodas around to the
rest of his squad, sweating in the tropical heat.
   ``I try not to think about Christmas because that just makes it
harder,'' he said. ``But the moral support of the people has really
helped.''
   Sgt. John Stowe was one of the few who had planned to spend
Christmas in Panama City. But he thought it would be his hometown,
Panama City, Fla.
   Instead of unwrapping Christmas gifts, he was cracking open
boxes of G3 assault rifles at an arms cache.
   He didn't seem to mind. The cache was one of the biggest found
so far.
   At the international airport, which U.S. troops seized the first
night of the invasion, a group of soldiers sat around with their
M-16s singing Christmas carols.
   For some, it was still a family Christmas, even though they were
far from home.
   Sgt. 1st Class William Lucas and his son, Pvt. William Lucas
Jr., both parachuted in with the 82nd Airborne Division from Fort
Bragg, N.C. So did Lt. William Knowlton and his brother, 2nd Lt.
Mark Knowlton, of Fayetteville, N.C.
   Marine Corp. Chris Moeller, 20, managed to get someone to call
his wife, Jamie, and his 2-year-old son, Matthew, with this
message: ``Tell her I love her very much and to have a very merry
Christmas.''
   Mrs. Moeller, in Martin, Tenn., wept when she got the call.
   ``One guy he knows was killed and another was wounded,'' she
said. ``I have been so worried.''
   The corporal's presents are wrapped and waiting for him when he
gets home, she said.

   Teddy Bear made it home for Christmas, a
bit battered but still a happy sight to the dog's owners, who were
almost fleeced out of reward money offered for their pet's return.
   The 4-year-old Chinese Shih Tzu slipped its collar last Monday,
leading Dean and Susan Rider to post reward offers around town and
in the newspaper.
   They got a call from a man who said he and his wife had picked
up the dog and taken him to San Diego. In exchange for wiring of
the $300 reward money, the caller said he would ship Teddy Bear
home.
   But when Dean Rider checked the address the man gave, he learned
it was a residential hotel that doesn't allow pets. And there was
no one registered there under the name given to Rider.
   But after they were the focus of a newspaper story about the
incident, the Riders got another phone call, this one legitimate.
   An employee at the Mission District animal shelter recognized
the dog pictured in the newspaper story as one brought to the
center after being hit by a car. The good Samaritan immediately
called the Riders.
   ``He's got a big fat lip, and a bruised hip, a gash in his paw
and an eye infection, but he was wild with joy when he saw us,''
said Rider about his pet.
   He said the 12-pound dog, with its fluffy, long hair tied in a
knot on his head, will heal eventually.
   Teddy Bear is spending the holiday playing with his sister,
Bitsy, and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals is
$1,000 richer thanks to a donation by the Riders.

   A Texas congressman says he would like to
run against those who are whispering he should retire because of
his age _ in a footrace, not an election.
   Rep. Ralph Hall, 66, said the rumors he will retire after his
fifth term are simply not true. He said he is still in great shape.
   ``I run a mile and a half and do 100 sit-ups a day,'' he said.
``As long as I'm healthy and my wife's healthy, I intend to stay in
Congress.''
   And to those who started the rumors, Hall said: ``I challenge
them to a race, whoever they are.''

   Two police officers trying to deliver a pregnant
woman to a Bronx hospital on Christmas Eve instead delivered a baby
girl in the back seat of their squad car.
   Clarice Ikoli, 25, of the borough of Manhattan was visiting
friends in the Bronx when she went into labor about 2:30 p.m.
Sunday, said Lt. Ray O'Donnell, a police spokesman.
   Officers Thomas Vinton and Kevin O'Keeffe responded to the 911
call, and helped Ms. Ikoli into the back seat of their radio car,
O'Donnell said.
   But they never got away from the curb. Ms. Ikoli promptly gave
birth to a baby girl, assisted by the two officers.
   Mother and daughter, who is to be named Christine, were taken to
Bronx-Lebanon Hospital, where they were doing fine, O'Donnell said.

   Fire swept through a 10-story
retirement home Christmas Eve, killing at least 15 people,
authorities said. At least 26 people were injured.
   Firefighters had the blaze under control early Monday as
rescuers continued to hunt for people who might be trapped in the
John Sevier Retirement Center, city spokeswoman Linda Gordon told a
news conference.
   Fifteen deaths were confirmed late Sunday, and two searches of
the building shortly before midnight failed to turn up any more
bodies, Ms. Gordon said.
   ``Firefighters are still in the building,'' she said early
Monday. ``We'll be searching all night. We've swept the building
completely two times ... The fire chief says we'll go in from top
to bottom at least two more times.''
   A temporary morgue was set up at the Washington County
Courthouse in this eastern Tennessee city in the Appalachian
Mountains, said rescue worker John Charlton.
   Charlton said a few hours after the fire broke out that workers
at the morgue were ``preparing for 50 people at this point. It
could be four more, it could be 40 more. We really don't have a
handle on it.''
   About 145 people were living at the center, but authorities said
they didn't know how many were in the building when the fire broke
out around 5:30 p.m.
   ``But it being Christmas Eve, many residents were out of the
building visiting families and many relatives were visiting at the
center,'' said Ms. Gordon.
   The cause of the fire was not immediately known, but it was
believed to have started on the second floor, officials said.
   The names of the dead were not released pending notification of
relatives.
   Three people were admitted to Northside Hospital, where they
were treated for smoke inhalation, said hospital spokesman Dan
Blevins. At least one person suffered serious burns, he said.
   Two people were admitted to the Veterans Administration hospital
for smoke inhalation, a spokesperson said.
   Twenty-one others were admitted to hospitals for observation,
officials said.
   Firefighters and rescue workers from around the region battled
the blaze in temperatures that only reached the teens.
   ``We've received a tremendous amount of help,'' Charlton said.
   A basement rescue station was set up across the street at Munsey
Memorial United Methodist Church, where medical workers treated
residents initially. The American Red Cross set up an information
center for relatives in the church auditorium.
   The fire is the second at the center within recent weeks. The
earlier fire was contained to one unit, but the building was
evacuated.
   Johnson City is about 100 miles northeast of Knoxville.

<HEAD>Hundreds of Needy People Left Empty-Handed By Theft of Food Packages</HEAD>

   Hundreds of needy people were turned away
empty-handed from a community center after a real-life Grinch stole
thousands of dollars worth of food, toys and clothing collected for
a traditional Christmas Eve giveaway.
   Volunteer workers at the Paul Hall Community Services Center
were distributing whatever food and toys were left by burglars who
broke into a storage shed early Sunday morning, said Willie Hall,
director of the center.
   ``We did distribute about 400 food baskets today, but we had to
turn away about 300-400 people this afternoon,'' Hall said.
   ``People were very distressed, but they did understand the
problems. We assured them we are doing the best we can to try to
get some food to accommodate them.''
   The center also had planned to distribute toys to about 1,000
children Christmas Eve, but there were only enough toys left for
500 children, Hall said.
   Frank Campbell, a spokesman for the center, said the theft
disappointed many of the needy _ some of whom had been waiting in
freezing temperatures as early as 7 a.m. for the afternoon
distribution.
   ``Some Grinch came in and stole Christmas for these kids,''
Campbell said. ``Our main goal was to supply a nice meal for people
who are poor and homeless throughout the city.''
   The thieves also stole train sets, remote-controlled cars and
other toys donated by local businesses, Hall said.
   The burglars must have been prepared for the theft, Campbell
said, because in four hours they stole several hundred 10-pound
turkeys, hams and chickens as well as several hundred toys.
   Campbell said he didn't know the exact value of the items taken
because most were donated, but estimated at least $3,000 worth of
property had been taken.
   As news about the theft spread, hundreds of people came to the
South Side center throughout the afternoon and evening to donate
hams, turkeys and canned goods, Hall said.
   He said organizers planned to distribute food baskets today to
those who were turned away.
   ``The theft did kill the Christmas spirit earlier, but people
have come throughout the day to show the Christmas spirit,'' Hall
said. ``Hundreds of people in the Chicago area have come ... to
help us out in our plight.''
   Police were working to find the culprit or culprits, said
Officer John Crotty.
   ``We're not looking for anything from these (burglars),''
Campbell said. ``What we would like is whoever broke in today to
bring the food back.''
   The community center, originally called the Paul Hall Boys Club,
was founded in the 1960s by the Rev. Paul J. Hall, who gained
national attention for his efforts to help poor youngsters and
their families through such projects as Christmas food giveaways.

   Two police officers were on patrol when a man
who looked like a haggard Santa Claus flagged them down from the
side of the road, saying he had something to give them.
   The white-bearded man, dressed in worn overalls and a thinning
jacket, led officers Michael Leonard and Ed McDaniel to his
makeshift home _ a clapboard hideaway tucked beneath the stairwell
of a warehouse _ and handed them two magnificently handcarved
wooden toys.
   ``I want you to give these to a boy and a girl who would
otherwise not have a good Christmas,'' Wayne Miller, 53, told the
officers.
   ``We were moved to tears,'' Leonard said Friday as he recalled
the recent encounter near the Marine Corps Recruit Depot. ``He had
several other toys in various stages (of completion), and he seemed
very disappointed that those would not be ready for Christmas.''
   Miller revealed little about his personal life to the officers
except that he has been living on the streets by his own choosing
for 12 years. One of the toys, which he began carving last July,
was an auto that could double as a jewelry box because of its
compartments. The other was a tractor-trailor loaded with logs.
   ``He collected the materials to build the toys while digging
through dumpsters for food and aluminum cans,'' Leonard said. ``At
night, he carves the wood in front of his campfire.''
   Leonard delivered the toys to the Department of Social Services
Children's Center, where assistant deputy director Sherry Paul
promised that workers would deliver the gifts to a family by today.
   The officers, meanwhile, started a collection to buy Miller a
sleeping bag or warm jacket, despite Miller's insistence that he's
doing fine.

<HEAD>Captors Wanted CBS Producer To Tell Panamanian Story</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Panamanians who held captive a CBS News producer
and another American had hoped to use them to bargain for the
release of troops captured by U.S. servicemen, the producer said.
   The people who held the men for four days ``cried hysterically''
when freeing them Saturday, 33-year-old Jon Meyersohn told a news
conference Sunday.
   ``Evidently they couldn't find anyone to negotiate with,''
Meyersohn said. ``They didn't really know what to do with us, they
just knew they had a hot property.''
   Meyersohn and Doug Mullen, a GTE executive, were seized
Wednesday at the Marriott hotel in Panama City by paramilitary
forces loyal to deposed strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. They
were released unharmed Saturday.
   At a news conference at CBS in New York, Meyersohn said he and
Mullen were tied up, threatened and psychologically abused but were
not physically harmed during their four-day ordeal.
   He said his captors appeared disorganized and confused before
surrendering to U.S. Embassy officials Saturday afternoon.
   ``Everyone was in tears,'' Meyersohn said.
   Meyersohn said his captors, armed with AK-47 and M16 automatic
rifles as well as hand grenades, told them: ``We just want people
to understand what we're going through. Tell the world we just want
dignity, we don't want to be a colonial nation.''
   At least 24 U.S. servicemen have been killed and about 280
injured since the United States invaded and occupied Panama late
Tuesday and installed the civilian government of President
Guillermo Endara.
   Just hours after Meyersohn's Sunday news conference, U.S.
officials announced Noriega had turned himself in to the Vatican
mission in Panama and requested political asylum.
   Meyersohn and Mullen were abducted at about 9 a.m. Wednesday by
members of Noriega's so-called Dignity Battalions. Meyersohn said
he, Mullen and two others were first driven to a Panamanian Defense
Forces building.
   ``There were guns everywhere, guns in our faces, and we heard
threats like `we're going to kill the gringos,''' Meyersohn said.
   They were marched up six flights of steps, ordered to sit with
their hands on their heads and interrogated, he said.
   Meyersohn said that at one point a captain of the Panamanian
Defense Forces took Mullen and Meyersohn aside and told them in
English, ``We need you as a hostage to bargain for.''
   The two Americans were then tied up with their shoelaces, taken
back to the pickup truck, made to lie beneath a tarpaulin and
driven away. Later they were driven about 30 minutes into the
countryside.
   The Americans were taken to three other locations, including a
jungle clearing, where they were tied up. On Saturday they were
taken to the apartment of a Panamanian friend of Mullen, who
negotiated their release.
   Meyersohn said that while in captivity he thought often of the
15 hostages held in Lebanon, particularly about Terry Anderson, the
chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, who has
been held since 1985.
   ``I'll never look at a hostage situation in the same way
again,'' Meyersohn said.

   The dollar slipped against the Japanese yen today,
while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rebounded sharply
following the Bank of Japan's decision to raise its discount rate
by a half percentage point.
   The dollar closed at 142.72 yen, down 0.95 yen from Friday's
close of 143.67 yen. After opening at 142.72 yen, the currency
never moved higher, changing hands between 141.95-142.72 yen in
mixed trading.
   Currency dealers said the dollar's fall followed its weakness in
the New York market Friday, affected by factors such as the
weakening U.S. economy and expectations of further easing of U.S.
interest rates.
   ``There is a sense in the market that the yen is too weak
despite Japan's trade surplus,'' said a dealer at a major Japanese
bank, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Another dealer with the Bank of Tokyo said there was little
movement on the exchange market in early trading, as many overseas
markets, including those in the United States, were to stay closed
Monday for the Christmas holiday.
   The Bank of Japan, the nation's central bank, said it decided to
raise the discount rate to 4.25 percent from its current level at
3.75 percent. The hike would be put into effect immediately, the
bank said.
   The discount rate is the rate the central bank charges on its
loans to commercial banks.
   The Yomiuri Shimbun, the largest mass-circulation newspaper in
Japan, said the central bank's policy board decided to strike a
pre-emptive blow against inflationary pressures, stemming from
continued high growth in the money supply, upward pressure on land
prices and tightness in the labor market.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which lost 175.11 points Friday, won back 383.25
points, or 0.99 percent, to close at 38,423.62.
   Securities dealers said share prices were moving in a narrow
range during the morning session as investors remained on the
sidelines in response to yet unconfirmed reports of the interest
rate hike.
   But once the discount rate hike was announced in the early
afternoon, investors enthusiastically placed buy orders.
   ``The market welcomed the discount rate hike,'' said a dealer at
Nikko Securities Co., speaking on condition of anonymity.

<TEXT>
   The Carolinas and parts of Georgia had their first white
Christmas in at least a century and Florida utility officials asked
people not to use electric ovens to cook holiday turkeys today as a
stubborn cold wave refused to ease.
   Temperatures in northern Florida were lower than in Anchorage,
Alaska, this morning _ 22 in Jacksonville at 2 a.m. EST, compared
with 31 in Anchorage.
   One visitor to Florida wasn't complaining.
   ``This is nice. It's not Christmas without some cold,'' said
Louis Dussault of Montreal, strolling in Miami Beach with his wife
and two children.
   Florida Gov. Bob Martinez extended a state of emergency to
today, easing weight restrictions on roads and bridges to help
growers move freeze-damaged citrus and strawberry crops quickly.
   ``There is no one smiling in Florida agriculture today,'' said
Roy Parke of Parkesdale Farms in Plant City, self-proclaimed winter
strawberry capital of the nation.
   And though warmer weather creeped slowly eastward, it was too
late to prevent citrus crop devastation in the lower Rio Grande
Valley of Texas, where temperatures plunged to 11 degrees during
the weekend. Temperatures hit the low 50s there Sunday but dipped
below freezing again this morning.
   ``It's going to take probably weeks and maybe months to
determine how much damage we've had,'' said Richard Hensz, director
of the Texas A&amp;I University Citrus Center in Weslaco. ``But it's
very extensive.''
   The arctic blast has left a trail of nearly 300 broken records
from the Canadian border to the Gulf of Mexico since Friday, the
National Weather Service said. It it has been blamed for at least
83 deaths from the Plains to the East Coast since Dec. 15.
   It was a painfully cold Christmas for thousands of homeless. In
New York, despite the efforts of volunteers infused with the
holiday spirit, an estimated 38,000 homeless men, women and
children were expected to be without shelter today, said Peter
Smith, president of Partnership of the Homeless, a private shelter
network. He estimated New York city's homeless population at 82,000.
   Across the nation, Smith estimated, there are 720,000 people
without shelter _ 36 percent of the total 2 million homeless.
   The cold combined with a low-pressure system off the
mid-Atlantic coast Sunday to create blizzards in the Carolinas.
   Drifts stood up to 8 feet high in South Carolina, and
Wilmington, N.C., recorded its greatest snowfall ever, 15 inches,
eclipsing the record of 12{ inches on Feb. 9-10, 1973.
   The last white Christmas in Wilmington was in 1870, and for
North Carolina's Outer Banks it was 1874. Along the Georgia coast,
it was the first since at least 1871, the weather service said.
   The blizzard caused a 600-foot Navy tanker to run aground on the
Outer Banks. No fuel spilled and nobody was injured.
   The cold wave stranded travelers and overloaded power plants in
Florida.
   Transformers and electric cables overloaded despite rotating
blackouts. About 300,000 of the 3 million customers of Florida
Power &amp; Light Co. were without power Sunday, some for more than 10
hours, said Palm Beach district manager Bill Ellis.
   With many businesses and restaurants closed for the holiday,
utilities planned fewer blackouts overnight, but slow-cooking
turkey dinners on Christmas remained a problem, said Rick Janka,
spokesman for Florida Power Co. on the Gulf Coast.
   ``The Christmas tree lights won't be too much of a problem now,
but we still have to conserve higher energy uses like dishwashers
and ovens,'' Janka said.
   Among places recording temperatures in the single digits Sunday
were Ocala, Fla.; Athens, Atlanta and Columbus, Ga.; and Mobile,
Ala.
   Florida's governor mobilized National Guardsmen and other state
workers to rescue motorists from gridlocked, icy highways.
   But warmer weather in the Midwest began moving eastward.
Temperatures rose to 40 at Chamberlain, S.D., and into the 20s in
Minneapolis after nearly five straight days below zero.

   Children across America ripped open Christmas wrappings today,
and gifts and cards poured into military hospitals for GIs wounded
last week in the U.S. invasion of Panama.
   But on the nation's streets, an estimated 720,000 of the
country's 2 million homeless men, women and children spent the
holiday without shelter, said Peter Smith, president of Partnership
of the Homeless, a private shelter network in New York.
   Around the nation, many tried to make the holiday brighter for
the homeless. In Los Angeles, Alex Trebek, host of the TV game show
``Jeopardy,'' waited on tables at a shelter that expected to serve
5,000 meals.
   ``Hey, this isn't much,'' said Trebek. ``We all should be doing
more. We shouldn't have this problem in this rich country.''
   In Atlanta, 5,500 volunteers prepared to set tables and hand out
gifts for 40,000 of the city's less fortunate residents.
   And one Manhattan restaurant served meals to 45 homeless women
and their children, who were also visited by a Santa bearing gifts.
   ``I know we're doing something small but it's our personal
start,'' said Michael Miele, co-owner of the Amsterdam Bar and
Rotisserie.
   Gifts and cards poured into military hospitals for the GIs in
San Antonio, Fort Bragg, N.C., and Fort Lewis, Wash.
   At a supermarket in Clark, N.J., last-minute shoppers greeted
the news of Panama strongman Manuel Noriega taking refuge in the
residence of the Vatican's representative in Panama City. The news
was announced over the store intercom.
   ``That's a nice Christmas present,'' said a checkout clerk.
``Now let's hang him.''
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said it was ironic that Noreiga sought
asylum on Christmas Eve in a church. ``At least we know where the
bum is,'' Helms said late Sunday. ``It is the height of irony that
this man, who has got to be one of the most barbaric terrorists in
history, is now running to the church for sanctuary.''
   In a Cajun celebration more than two centuries old, residents of
St. James Parish, La., upriver from New Orleans light bonfires
shaped like wooden boats, fire trucks and medieval castles and
teepees filled with kindling so Pere Noel _ Father Noel _ won't get
lost in the dark on Christmas Eve.
   In Wichita, Kan., a Vietnamese couple planned to spend Christmas
with their 11-year-old son following a tearful reunion Saturday
with the child they left behind when they fled their homeland 10
years ago.
   When Quang Vu walked off an airplane and into a Wichita airport,
his mother Anh Le clutched him to her chest and burst into tears.
She last saw her son when he was 7 months old, before she and her
husband, Tom Vu, escaped from Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam.
   ``We'll talk, maybe tonight we won't sleep,'' Ms. Vu said. ``We
feel a big relief. We don't have to worry anything about it
anymore. We have more time to concentrate on our future.''
   In East St. Louis, Ill., Santa's helper was a psychologist who
remembers her own Christmases in an orphanage, and has been handing
out toys since 1966.
   Rita Swiener said she expected to give out presents to 1,300
children and adults. She said she had spent $6,000 of her own money
and had gotten many donations.
   ``I keep telling myself next year I'll put a limit on and stick
to it, but I just can't say no to these people,'' she said.

<HEAD>De Klerk Appeals For Reconciliation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President F.W. de Klerk, in a
Christmas message to the nation, urged South Africans to ``show the
world how people of different cultures can work together in
friendship.''
   In his message Sunday, De Klerk also appealed to church leaders
to work with him in trying to create ``a new, just South Africa.''
This contrasted with frequent admonitions of his predecessor, P.W.
Botha, that the clergy should stay out of politics.
   Botha quit the presidency in August after losing a power
struggle with de Klerk, who has made a series of conciliatory moves
aimed at clearing the way for negotiations with black leaders.
   De Klerk has offered to negotiate a new constitution that would
extend political rights to blacks, although he opposes a
one-person, one-vote system that would lead to black majority rule.
   ``We reject confrontation and conflict and seek reconciliation
and cooperation,'' he said in his nationally broadcast message.
``Let us show the world how people of different cultures can work
together in friendship and peace with mutual respect. This cannot
be achived by coercion, only by honest dialogue and negotiation.''
   He urged those who feel wronged by past events to ``put their
bitterness behind them'' and said all South Africans should ``get
to know one other better and understand each other's fears and
aspirations.''
   ``May 1990 be the foundation of a new, just South Africa,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Mrs. Quayle Suggests Use of Morning After Pill for Rape Victims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marilyn Quayle said rape victims should be
allowed to abort a pregnancy, and in such cases she supported use
of a French morning after pill.
   The use of the pill, known as RU486, has been strongly fought in
the United States by anti-abortion groups.
   Mrs. Quayle, wife of Vice President Dan Quayle, made her
comments in an interview Sunday on the use of a pill. Her
statements apparently contradict comments she made on the issue
last week.
   Mrs. Quayle said in a letter Thursday to John C. Willke,
president of the National Right to Life Committee, ``I do not
support any medical procedures or pills other than those that
actually prevent pregnancy.''
   Willke wrote her asking for a clarification of her position on
the issue.
   In the letter, it was not clear whether she was referring to
contraceptive pills or other pills, including RU486.
   ``I think that anyone who is raped should report it absolutely
immediately, and every step should be taken to insure that a
pregnancy has not occurred,'' Mrs. Quayle told the Daily News.
   ``Something like the French morning after pill, if proven
effective, would be very appropriate and would lessen the
psychological trauma of a rape victim,'' she said.
   RU486 is a synthetic chemical that causes an abortion by
inducing the uterus to expel the egg.

<HEAD>Ernest Morial, New Orleans' First Black Mayor, Dies At 60</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA ASHTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ernest Morial, New Orleans' first black mayor
who spent a lifetime breaking down racial barriers, has died from
an apparent heart attack after leaving a Christmas party. He was 60.
   Morial was found slumped over the steering wheel of his car at
11 p.m. Saturday after leaving a party, said Jinx Broussard, a
spokeswoman for Mayor Sidney Barthelemy. Morial apparently had
suffered a heart attack.
   He was taken to Mercy Hospital where efforts to revive him
failed, and was pronounced dead at 1:30 a.m. Sunday, Broussard said.
   The feisty attorney became the city's first black mayor in 1978
at a ceremony loaded with symbols of black-white unity and tough
promises.
   He served two terms, leaving office in 1986 after an
unsuccessful attempt to persuade voters to amend the city charter
to allow him a third consecutive term. He then practiced law.
   Becoming mayor wasn't the only time he achieved a first for
blacks.
   He was the first black graduate from Louisiana State University
law school in 1954. He was the first black assistant U.S. attorney
in Louisiana, serving from 1965 to 1967. He became the first black
Louisiana legislator in modern times, serving in the House from
1967 to 1970, when he was appointed to a juvenile court judgeship.
In 1973, he was the first black elected to the Louisiana 4th
Circuit Court of Appeal.
   He also was a president of the National Conference of Mayors, a
Democratic National Committee member, and an adviser to Democratic
presidential candidate Michael Dukakis in 1988.
   Moon Landrieu, who was mayor from 1970 to 1978, said Sunday that
Morial was a formidable leader who left his mark on city, state and
national politics.
   ``I'm satisfied that when you're the first of anything, you're
long remembered for that. `Dutch' was the first black individual to
achieve high public office in this state. ... That alone I think is
a very significant achievement,'' Landrieu said.
   ``I think he will also be remembered for his tenacity and
pugnaciousness. He was certainly controversial, and I think will be
remembered for that also, and very fondly by some.''
   Morial was born Ernest Nathan Morial on Oct. 9, 1929, a son of a
New Orleans cigar maker. Morial later had his name changed to make
his nickname, Dutch, his second middle name.
   ``He was really an extraordinary individual,'' said Arnold
Hirsch, a professor of history and urban studies at the University
of New Orleans.
   ``If there's one thing that constantly comes to mind about
Morial, it was his dogged refusal to accept any of the barriers
that were laid in his way.''
   Morial's public service career was launched in the 1960s when he
became president of the local chapter of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People.
   ``He had his signature on almost every case that began to
dismantle the edifice of Jim Crow here, brick by brick,'' Hirsch
said.
   At a speech in 1967, Morial said: ``New Orleans won't have the
kind of political climate it takes to elect a Negro mayor for eight
or 10 years.'' He was elected 10 years later.
   As mayor, Morial dealt with floods in 1978, a city police strike
in 1979 that effectively shut down Mardi Gras, and the 1984
Louisiana World Exposition that was a financial disaster.
   When voters rejected a charter change that would have allowed
him to run for a third term, Morial backed Sen. Bill Jefferson to
succeed him. But Jefferson was defeated by Sidney Barthelemy, a
former state legislator and councilman. Barthelemy is up for
re-election in February 1990.
   Morial had been considering running against Barthelemy and
challenger Donald Mintz. But two weeks ago, he said the demands on
his family would be too great.
   Survivors include his wife, Sybil, and five children.
   Morial will lie in state Wednesday at Gallier Hall in New
Orleans. A prayer service is scheduled that evening in Municipal
Auditorium.
   A funeral Mass will be said Thursday at historic St. Louis
Cathedral in the French Quarter. Burial will be in St. Louis
Cemetery No. 1.

<HEAD>2,000 In Noisy March For Political Reform</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 2,000 opposition supporters marched
downtown today in a noisy but peaceful demonstration on
Constitution Day to demand swifter political reform.
   About 2,000 riot policemen backed by water cannon trucks guarded
the National Assembly building from behind barbed-wire barricades.
   Earlier, 11 legislators from the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party scuffled with guards at the National Assembly who
tried to prevent them from carrying protest banners into the
building.
   Three assemblymen said they suffered bruises in the brief
scuffle before they were allowed to take the banners into the
National Assembly where President Lee Teng-hui appealed for greater
tolerance toward dissent.
   ``In a more open society we need to have the magnanimity to
tolerate dissent,'' Lee told the assembly. ``As our society faces a
transition, we need to build a new political culture and strengthen
psychological reconstruction.''
   As Lee and Premier Lee Huan addressed the assembly, Taiwan's
electoral college, the opposition assemblymen unfurled their
banners which demanded ``Aging Assemblymen Step Down,'' ``We Want
Universal Suffrage For The Presidency'' and ``Please Proclaim
Taiwan an Independent State.''
   Both the Nationalist government in Taiwan and the rival
Communist government in Beijing are opposed to independence for
Taiwan, which they say is a Chinese province. Both say they are the
sole legitimate government of all China, and Beijing has indicated
it may use force to prevent Taiwan from gaining independence.
   The 780-member National Assembly, which meets every six years to
elect the president, is dominated by aging members, many in their
70s, who were elected on the Chinese mainland before the
Nationalists fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war to the
Communists.
   Most of the aged assemblymen are Nationalist supporters and they
have been frozen in office to support the Nationalist claim to be
the legitimate government of China.
   The opposition has demanded the retirement of the aged
assemblymen. The government has offered them handsome pensions if
they step down, but has refused to force them to retire.
   ``The old members did not face re-election for 40 years (and
they) cannot represent Taiwanese people,'' said Chou Ching-yu, a
Democratic Progressive Party assemblywoman. ``They don't have the
right to elect our president.''
   Lee, who is expected to be re-elected president in March, told
opposition assemblymen at a meeting last week that political
reforms must be introduced slowly to maintain Taiwan's stability.

   Arctic winds froze Florida early today, dropping temperatures
below the freezing mark from Jacksonville to Miami. Tampa was 28
degrees early Christmas morning, the same temperature as Anchorage,
Alaska.
   But in the Midwest, Christmas brought warmer weather.
Temperatures early today rose to 20s throughout the region _ even
Minneapolis, which had experienced nearly five straight days below
zero.
   On Sunday, the northern Florida town of Crestview reported a low
of 9 degrees. The warmest temperature in the state was 52 degrees
at Key West.
   During the past three days the latest surge of arctic air left a
trail of nearly 300 broken temperature marks from the Canadian
border to the Gulf of Mexico.
   The arctic blast combined with low pressure off the Carolina
coast to bring record snows and blizzard conditions to eastern
North Carolina. Snowfall totals ranged up to 15 inches in Pender
and New Hanover counties, and high winds whipped the snow into
drifts up to 8 feet.
   A snowfall of 15 inches at Wilmington, N.C., was their greatest
since records began in 1871. For parts of the Carolinas, today was
the first white Christmas on record.
   Record lows for the date on Sunday included: Albany, N.Y., minus
15; Allentown, Pa., minus 5; Apalacicola, Fla., 14; Baton Rouge,
La., 10; Brownsville, Texas, 18; Burlington, Vt., minus 18;
Charleston, W.Va., minus 9; Concord, N.H., minus 20; Daytona Beach,
Fla, 20; Fort Lauderdale, Fla, 30; Houston, 11; Key West, Fla., 44;
Lexington, Ky., minus 10.
   Also: Longview, Texas, 9; Meridian, Miss., 6; Miami, 31; Mobile,
Ala., 9; New Orleans, 15; Orlando, Fla., 22; Portland, Maine, minus
13; Syracuse, N.Y., minus 14; and Tallahassee, Fla., 13;
   In the Midwest, southerly winds brought much warmer weather.
Temperatures have been rising almost continuously since Saturday
morning, with Sunday afternoon higs in the 30s and 40s, with 50s
and 60s reported in the southern High Plains.
   A winter storm watch, however, was posted today for parts of
western and central upper Michigan near Lake Superior, where up to
a foot of snow is possible by Christmas evening.
   Southern California, meanwhile, recorded temperatures into the
80s on Sunday, with several cities reporting new record highs for
the date.
   The high for the nation Sunday was 89 degrees at Fallbrook,
Calif.

   A trail through Aptos Canyon has become a
tourist attraction, drawing hundreds of hikers eager to stand at
ground zero of the deadly and devastating October earthquake.
   ``It's awfully crowded ... it's swamped,'' said senior park aide
Barbara Louck on Sunday, adding that the crunch of curious
sightseers were creating problems for parking and access to the
six-mile round-trip trail.
   ``It's an exciting place to be,'' said Bud Getty, superintendent
of Forest of Nisene Marks State Park. ``This was the major quake of
people's lifetimes, and it really captures your imagination to walk
out to the epicenter. You can really see the power of the earth.''
   A sign posted by Ranger Jerry Waggoner marks the spot about 50
miles south of San Francisco that was calculated by latitude and
longitude. The site has 4-foot-diameter redwood trees snapped off
at the ground, and a 150-foot wide landslide nearby. Just beyond
the epicenter, the trail is closed because of danger from new
landslides.
   ``That's enough to convince me,'' said Pat Wagner, 62, of
Burlington, Iowa. ``I've never been in an earthquake _ and I never
want to be.''
   ``Can you imagine what it took to rip these trees out?'' asked
Julie Dawson of Milpitas during a hike to the epicenter last week.
``And can you imagine the sound it made? Snap, crackle and pop!''
   Dawson said she understands why the previously obscure park site
has become so popular since the 7.1-magnitude on Oct. 17 that
killed 67 people and resulted in $10 billion in damage.
   ``I stayed away from San Francisco because I didn't want to be a
rubble necker. I wouldn't want that in my neighborhood,'' she said.
``But there's no one to bother out here.''
   The walk to the site takes about an hour. Most of the trail is
in a deep forest where sunlight rarely penetrates.
   In addition to Nisene Park, other San Francisco Bay area
locations are experiencing renewed interest from temblor tourists.
   At Point Reyes National Seashore, the 0.6-mile Earthquake Trial
leads to the epicenter of the 1906 San Francisco quake and visitors
can see a fence displaced by fault movement of 16 to 20 feet.
   And in Hollister, meeting place of the San Andreas, Calaveras
and Hayward faults, a self-guided earthquake walk wanders past
curbs offset by fault creep and buildings damaged in the Oct. 17
earthquake.

<HEAD>Communist Leadership Meets on Lithuanian Party's Breakaway Move</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Communist Party leadership met today to
deal with the Lithuanian party's unprecedented declaration of
independence from the Kremlin.
   Lithuanian Communists voted Wednesday at a special congress in
Vilnius to form their own party, rejecting appeals for unity from
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other top Soviet officials.
   State-run Radio Moscow reported that the national party's
policy-making Central Committee convened in Moscow ``to consider
the situation in the Lithuanian party branch.''
   The Lithuanians' break is serious because it is without
precedent in the history of the party founded by Vladimir I. Lenin,
who demanded and forged a unitary party across the entire territory
of the Soviet Union. Lithuanian reformers predict local party
organizations in many of the other 14 constituent Soviet republics
may follow suit.
   Algirdas Brazauskas, the Lithuanian party leader, said the
break, which included drafting a separate party program, was
necessary for Lithuanian Communists to compete successfully in
local elections Feb. 24.
   However, Lithuanian Communists who opposed the break formed
their own leadership, and pledged continuing loyalty to Moscow.
   The national party leadership invited both Brazauskas and the
leaders of the anti-separatist faction to Moscow to attend today's
meeting, Radio Moscow said.

   One jet returned to O'Hare International Airport

   The pilot of United Airlines Flight 103, originating in Chicago

emergency vehicles standing by, United spokesman Joe Hopkins said.
Passengers were put on another flight.

   ``There was no major problem,'' said Duncan, adding that the
plane had two backup hydraulic systems.
   Both planes were being examined Sunday.

<HEAD>Fire Tragedy Turns One Town into a Gift-Giving Community</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fire that left two families and six
children homeless has brought this community together in a spirit
of Christmas giving.
   The outpouring of generosity began after police Officer Ruben
Gonzalez saw a little girl crying after her family's home was
destroyed by fire Saturday night. No one was injured in the fire.
   The officer took up a collection at work so the girl and five
other children _ members of two related families sharing the home _
would have presents to unwrap when they awoke Christmas morning.
   Gonzalez said he was amazed as fellow officers dug into their
pockets and pulled out as much as $30 to $50 each.
   ``I didn't realize people would be so giving,'' he said Sunday.
   It didn't stop with the officers. After the 56-officer police
force raised $500, the Monrovia Police Association matched it.
   Word spread across Monrovia, a city of 33,500 residents about 20
miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles.
   Gonzalez, on a lunch break at a coffee shop, was greeted by
people with wads of money.
   ``The waitresses had heard about the situation and all the
employees and some patrons started dropping money on the table,''
he said.
   A bike shop provided a bicycle and a grocery store kicked in
with a turkey dinner and $200 in food certificates, police Sgt.
Donald Lacher said.
   A local Christmas tree lot gave the family a tree and the police
officers stripped the station of all ornaments to decorate it.
   And Gonzalez said a man who was passing the home as it was on
fire left a motor home there for the family to use.
   ``He stopped and tried to help and he asked if anything can be
done,'' Gonzalez said. ``The motor home is still there, he just
left it for them. I sure would like to know who he is.''
   Officers were planning on delivering the gifts today.
   After the tree was delivered Sunday afternoon, 14-year-old
Robert Fuentes said that the Velasquez and Fuentes families
appreciated all the police had done for them.
   ``They've been a big help,'' Fuentes said.
   He said the families were very frightened after the fire, but
were doing better.
   ``Everybody has calmed down right now,'' he said. ``As long as
none of the kids got hurt, we don't care so much about the material
things.''

   Newspapers, radio and television stations
today released morale-boosting messages to eight Americans held
hostage in Lebanon, including two marking a fifth Christimas in
captivity.
   But there was no way to ascertain whether Terry Anderson and
Thomas Sutherland, kidnapped in 1985, or any of the other American
captives who are believed held by Shiite Moslem extremists were
allowed to hear or read the messages.
   ``I can hardly believe that your fifth Christmas season in
captivity is approaching,'' said Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, in a
letter written in advance to coincide with Christmas.
   ``Despite having no valid reason for believing that you might
celebrate this season as a free man, my faith prompts me to pray
very hard for a Christmas miracle,'' she wrote.
   The English text of her letter was published by the newspaper
An-Nahar along with an Arabic translation.
   The conservative Al-Anwar, the pro-Syrian Ash-Sharq and the
Moslem Al-Liwa published the Arabic translation of the letter, and
radio and television stations broadcast the message in English.
   ``We are counting on you to hold yourself together physically,
spiritually and emotionally until your day of freedom comes,'' Mrs.
Say wrote to Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press.
   ``Until then, stay strong and know that neither you nor those
held with you are alone or forgotten. Your daughters are as always,
well and beautiful.''
   Anderson has two daughters, Gabrielle, 13, and Sulome, 4. The
younger daughter was born three months after he was kidnapped on
March 16, 1985.
   Anderson, 42, of Lorain, Ohio, is the longest-held of the 18
Western captives in Lebanon.
   He and Sutherland, 58, of Fort Collins, Colo., are held by
Islamic Jihad, or Holy War, an extremist group seeking the release
of 15 comrades jailed in Kuwait on terrorist charges.
   Sutherland, acting dean of agriculture at the American
University of Beirut, was kidnapped June 9, 1985.
   One newspaper, the leftist As-Safir, published a paid
advertisement in Arabic and English carrying the message to
Sutherland.
   It was signed by his wife, Jean, his daughters Ann, Simone, Kit,
and Joan and the Murray and Sutherland families.
   ``May this find you and bring all the gifts we have of love,
hope, comfort, and spirit,'' the letter said. ``We wait for you _
we exist, we do not live without you.''
   The newspapers also published a letter from the Journalists
Committee to Free Terry Anderson that was addressed to all eight
Americans.
   The six others are Frank Reed, Joseph Cicippio, Edward Austin
Tracy, Alann Steen, Jesse Turner and Robert Polhill.
   ``We had hoped and prayed that this Christmas would be different
from the others and we'd see you all home,'' said the letter signed
by Bill Foley and Cary Vaughan for the committee.
   It concluded: ``Someday, someway, you will come home.''
   The other foreign hostages in Lebanon include four Britons, two
West Germans, two Swiss, an Italian and an Irishman.

<HEAD>Subdued Christmas Celebrations in Bethlehem, Violence in Gaza Strip</HEAD>

   Christians from around the
world today prayed where tradition holds that Jesus was born, but
the subdued Christmas was overshadowed by more violence in the
2-year-old Palestinian uprising.
   Israeli soldiers removed barricades and metal detectors from
Manger Square after Christmas Eve passed quietly in this town in
the occupied West Bank. Many troops also left the plaza during
morning Mass.
   Violent clashes were reported in the Gaza Strip, where soldiers
shot and wounded four Palestinians during stone-throwing protests
in Jebalya refugee camp, Arab reports said.
   In Jerusalem, a firebomb was thrown at parked Israeli cars on a
busy shopping street, causing no injury, and one Arab suspect was
detained near the scene, police said.
   Desmond Tutu, the South African Anglican archbishop, worshiped
at the Anglican St. George's church in Jerusalem's Arab sector. The
1984 Nobel Peace Prize winner has been criticized for repeatedly
voicing sympathy with the Palestinians since his arrival in Israel
Friday.
   Tutu's latest pro-Palestinian remarks came Sunday in a Christmas
Eve sermon at Shepherd's Field near Bethlehem, the site where
Jesus' birth was announced.
   ``We pray that Arabs and Jews will know that they are brother
and sister, that they belong in one family, that they belong in
God's family, that they belong in the human family. We support the
struggle of the Palestinian people for nationhood,'' Tutu said.
   ``But we say also, dear brothers and sisters, the Jews have a
right to their independent state as well,'' he said.
   Tutu's endorsement of a Palestinian state has alienated many
Israelis, and the nation's two chief rabbis refused to meet with
the Anglican human rights activist. Israeli media gave only sparse
coverage to Tutu's visit.
   The Palestinian uprising was also the theme of a Christmas
sermon given by Jerusalem's Roman Catholic patriarch, Michel
Sabbah, at midnight mass in St. Catherine's basilica on Manger
Square.
   ``How can we celebrate Christmas with what we are going through,
with our sons killed or in prison?'' asked Sabbah, the first Arab
appointed to his post. ``Despite all that is happening to you, you
will win, in the end you will win.
   ``To the Jewish people, we say the same thing: love and
forgiveness.''
   Since the uprising began Dec. 8, 1987, at least 639 Palestinians
have been killed and 43 Israelis have died.

   Two foreign journalists have been
killed and five wounded, including two Americans, during fighting
between revolutionaries and forces loyal to deposed President
Nicolae Ceausescu.
   Danny Huwe, 42, a Belgian reporter for the Belgian VTM
television, was shot and killed by snipers late Sunday when he
tried to enter the capital from Sofia, Bulgaria, by car, VTM said
today.
   On Saturday, Jean-Louis Calderon of France's La Cinq TV station
was crushed to death by a tank in Bucharest as he was reporting on
the fighting.
   Emre Aygen, 30, a reporter for the Turkish state television TRT
was seriously wounded early today on the outskirts of Bucharest,
said Hale Tuna, a TRT official in Ankara, Turkey. Tuna said Aygen
was wounded in the head by sniper fire as he traveled with a group
of journalists.
   The four other journalists were wounded in the western city of
Timisoara, and three ambulances sent into Romania from Yugoslavia
to evacuate the journalists today. All four were expected to
survive.
   Three of the journalists _ John Daniszewski of The Associated
Press, John Tagliabue of The New York Times, and an Italian
photographer _ were wounded in separate incidents while driving in
cars.
   A Yugoslav reporter was shot while dashing through the streets
of the western Romanian city, 20 miles east of the Yugoslav border.
   A Yugoslav diplomat was grazed by a bullet.
   A group of uniformed men on Saturday night ordered a car
carrying Daniszewski and a Yugoslav reporter, Ljuba Pajic, to stop,
then opened fire as soon as Daniszewski stepped on the brakes.
   One bullet struck his arm and two others grazed his head, the
Yugoslav Consulate said, quoting Pajic, who was not injured. The
assailants fled after robbing the reporters, the consulate said.
   Daniszewski arrived in Yugoslavia today, where he was
hospitalized in satisfactory condition.
   It was not immediately clear whose side the assailants were on.
   The fighting, in which security forces loyal to Ceausescu are
pitted against anti-Ceausescu civilians and their allies in the
army, has been fierce in Timisoara, the cradle of the insurgency
that toppled the hard-line Communist dictator in a week.
   Louis D. Boccardi, the president and general manager of the AP,
said: ``The AP is doing everything possible to help John
Daniszewski.
   ``The events in Romania graphically show the dangers that
correspondents, AP and others, experience in reporting world news
and the courage and bravery they display in doing their jobs.''
   Tagliabue was wounded in the back by a sniper who fired on a car
carrying him and other reporters, said Bernard Gwertzman, foreign
editor of The New York Times. The exact nature of Tagliabue's
injury was not clear, Gwertzman said in New York, but the reporter
was reported in satisfactory condition at a Timisoara hospital.
Tagliabue is the younger brother of Paul Tagliabue, commissioner of
National Football League and a Washington lawyer.
   The Warsaw-based Daniszewski, 36, left Poland last week to cover
the Timisoara fighting. He has been the AP's Warsaw correspondent
since June 1987, reporting on the political upheaval that climaxed
this year with the installation of a non-Communist leadership in
Poland.
   An Ohio native whose parents live in the Dayton suburb of
Centerville, Daniszewski is a graduate of the University of
Pennsylvania and worked for the AP in Philadelphia, Harrisburg and
New York before joining the news agency's foreign service.

   Pope John Paul II today prayed for Romanians ``celebrating this
Christmas in fear and trembling,'' mourned the thousands killed in
the overthrow of the Communist dictator and praised the wave of
democracy sweeping his native Eastern Europe.
   Romanians lit candles for peace, Panamanians braved gunfire to
celebrate the holiday and Lebanese shopped in sandbagged stores.
   Millions throughout the formerly orthodox Communist states of
Eastern Europe enjoyed their first Christmas in four decades with
the promise of freedom.
   Thousands of joyous West Germans took their first stroll on the
other side of the Berlin Wall on Sunday after East Germany lifted
visa and currency requirements in time for the holidays.
   In the pope's traditional Christmas message, John Paul prayed
for peace worldwide and said Merry Christmas in 53 languages as
tens of thousands of faithful and tourists stood in the sun-dappled
St. Peter's Square.
   ``In particular, bless at this hour, O Lord, the noble land of
Romania, which is celebrating this Christmas in fear and trembling,
with sorrow for the many human lives tragically lost and in the joy
of having taken once more the path of freedom,'' the pope said, his
head bowed in prayer.
   After his words about Romania, in which thousands of people have
been killed in the popular revolution that overthrew Communist
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, the pope paused for a few seconds and
lifted his head.
   He praised the peaceful changes sweeping other Eastern European
countries and asked Europeans to ``open her doors and her heart to
understand and receive the anxieties, the fears and the problems of
the nations which seek her help,'' the pope prayed.
   ``May she respond with the strength and the generosity of her
Christian roots to this very special moment of history... which the
world is now experiencing as if awakened from a nightmare and
opened up to a better hope.''
   In Bucharest, Romania, people lit candles in Romana Square today
for those who died in the struggle to overthrow Ceausescu's rule.
   On Sunday, some families carried freshly cut Christmas trees
during a lull in fighting between a revolutionary government and
forces loyal to Ceausescu, who was ousted Friday. Sniper fire later
cleared the streets.
   Snipers also made streets in Panama City dangerous, and many
families in the city of 1 million had nothing to give their
children.
   ``What am I going to tell my 6-year-old daughter? I cannot tell
her Santa Claus was killed by a bomb,'' one woman in a middle-class
neighborhood said.
   Some resorted to looting. Looters packed boxes and bags from
debris-strewn shops. At one supermarket a man said he arrived too
late for food, but had clothes for his children.
   ``This is their Christmas,'' he said.
   Another toted a case of champagne. ``This is mine,'' he said
grinning.
   Still, Christmas lights twinkled in some homes not wrecked by
shelling and fighting.
   Thousands of U.S. troops who invaded Panama on Wednesday to
drive from power the country's strongman, Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega, spent the holidays without Christmas trees or loved ones.
   But 21-year-old Sgt. Ernie Nieto said he was ``just glad to see
Christmas. The other night (in combat) I just wanted to see sunup.''
   In London, Queen Elizabeth II said ``it would be splendid'' if
all nations united to stop further environmental damage. The
queen's traditional Christmas message urged ``a particular
tenderness towards this earth, which we share as human beings.''
   Lebanese celebrated Christmas with a desperate intensity. Many
tried to blot out the horrors and the hardships brought by 14 years
of civil war.
   ``I want to spend the coming week drinking, dancing and just
living. Who knows if we'll be alive tomorrow?'' said Khalil Accad,
a Christian in east Beirut.
   Streets were choked with traffic as shoppers jammed stores, many
of which had sandbags outside to protect against gun shells.
   Eighteen Western hostages spent another Christmas in captivity
in Lebanon. For American Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, it was his fifth Christmas
as a hostage.
   In Bethlehem on the Israeli-occupied West Bank, soldiers with
rifles stood watch atop the building where the Bible says Jesus was
born, but few tourists gathered for the traditional Christmas Eve
celebrations.
   ``It doesn't feel like Christmas at all,'' complained tourist
Eijah Kivi of Turku, Finland, surveying the sparse gatherings and
the stores closed by Palestinians protesting the Israeli occupation.
   South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu delivered a sermon at the
biblical Shepherds' Field on the West Bank. He prayed that Arabs
and Jews will find peace and endorsed the Palestinian call for an
independent state.
   Thousands of Filipinos lit candles in front of homes, businesses
and military camps in an appeal for peace in their troubled land,
where at least 113 were killed during a coup attempt earlier this
month.

   Santa wore a red stocking cap and a police
badge as he handed out free gifts to the needy, but residents of an
alleged crack house invited him inside anyway.
   As a result, four of the house's residents were spending
Christmas weekend in jail, police said.
   Officer Conrad De Castro had been assigned to get a description
of the house so police could seek a warrant to search it for drugs.
   He approached the house on Saturday in uniform, wearing the
stocking cap and carrying presents. The occupants asked for some of
his gifts, and he told them he would return with others.
   He did, with a few empty boxes all wrapped up, and other
officers waiting outside.
   As the alleged drug dealers unwrapped the boxes, police said De
Castro noticed one gift under their Christmas tree: a plastic bag
that appeared to contain crack cocaine.
   De Castro used his walkie-talkie to alert other officers, who
helped make the arrests, police said.

   Pope John Paul II today prayed that the hope
of Christmas may spread through an Eastern Europe ``awakened from a
nightmare,'' and he sought a special blessing for Romania.
   Emerging at noon on his balcony overlooking St. Peter's Square,
the pope delivered his traditional Christmas message and wished
Merry Christmas in 53 languages before tens of thousands of people
in the sunny square.
   The pope kept his head bowed throughout most of his speech, but
paused and raised his head upward after his comments on Romania,
where thousands of people have died in the revolt that overthrew
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
   ``In particular, bless at this hour, O Lord, the noble land of
Romania, which is celebrating this Christmas in fear and trembling,
with sorrow for the many human lives tragically lost and in the joy
of having taken once more the path of freedom,'' the pope said.
   He also urged Europe ``to open her doors and her heart'' to
Eastern Europeans grappling with new challenges after toppling
hard-line Communists in power for four decades.
   ``May she respond with the strength and the generosity of her
Christian roots to this very special moment of history... which the
world is now experiencing as if awakened from a nightmare and
opened up to a better hope.''
   The pope did not mention Panama, where the Vatican Embassy was
surrounded by U.S. troops after deposed strongman Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega took refuge there and sought political asylum.

   Actor Kevin Costner is ``the man for the

Koppel's talent and fairness make him one of the year's most
watchable people, a women's group said.
   Actors Mel Gibson, Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman, basketball
star Magic Johnson and talk show host Arsenio Hall joined Costner
and Koppel on ManWatchers Inc.'s list of the Ten Most Watchable
People of 1989, announced Sunday.
   Rounding out the group for the first time were three women:
actress Michele Pfeiffer, first lady Barbara Bush and ``Today''
co-host Jane Pauley.
   ``This year we included women in our list of famous people who
are deserving of compliments,'' ManWatchers President Suzy Mallery
said. ``Looks are much less important than they used to be;
accomplishment, creativity, kindness and manners count much more.''
   Still, the group knows a hunk when it sees one. ``You are the
man of the '90s, or what we hope the man of the '90s will be like:
natural, comfortably masculine and sexy,'' it said of Costner.
   As for Nicholson, ``You're not getting older, you're getting
much better.''
   Manwatchers said Pfeiffer represents ``what many of today's
women would like to be: beautiful, bright and successful.'' The
group also said it admired the first lady's ``accomplishments,
warmth and naturalness of appearance.''

<TEXT>
   U.S. troops and armored vehicles
ringed the Vatican Embassy early today after deposed strongman Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega took refuge there and asked for political
asylum.
   American troops captured the town of Santiago southwest of
Panama City, but otherwise fighting died down as Christmas came to
Panama.
   About 40 soldiers kept watch in the pre-dawn darkness as a
helicopter, its running lights turned off, landed several times
across the street from the Vatican Embassy, then took off. The
chopper was not seen picking up or dropping off anyone.
   The Vatican, in its first official statement on the situation,
said today that Noriega took refuge in the embassy Sunday after
expressing ``the will to end the conflict'' between his supporters
and the United States.
   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro said it was too early to say
if Noriega would be handed over to the United States, where he
faces drug charges, or given passage to another country.
   Under international law, embassies are sacrosanct ground and
U.S. troops cannot legally enter the papal embassy to arrest
Noriega.
   Earlier, an official at the Vatican said he doubted the embassy
would immediately turn Noriega over to the United States.
   Panamanians banged pots and pans and cheered when word of
Noriega's surrender spread through the capital, littered with glass
and looted bare after five days of fighting.
   The American invasion, which began at midnight Tuesday, has
killed at least 23 American soldiers and two American civilians,
and nearly 300 Panamanians, according to U.S. figures announced
today. Many Panamanian victims are believed to be civilians.
   Lt. Col. Jerry Murguia told reporters at a Southern Command
briefing today that American troops had captured Santiago, 120
miles southwest of Panama City, taking 188 prisoners and seizing
several hundred small arms.
   ``It was a quiet night. That's the good news,'' he said.
   There was little else to celebrate in this mainly Roman Catholic
country.
   ``What am I going to tell my 6-year-old daughter? I cannot tell
her Santa Claus was killed by a bomb,'' said one woman in a
middle-class neighborhood Christmas Eve.
   Residents roamed their neighborhoods, cleaned glass and trash
off streets and put up Christmas lights.
   Noriega drove himself or was driven to the embassy in a car at
about 3 p.m. Sunday, an informed military source said. None of the
26,000 American troops searching for Noriega in this Central
American country was at the embassy at the time.
   American soldiers had surrounded the Nicaraguan and Cuban
embassies after rumors Noriega might seek refuge there.
   Navarro rejected the idea the Vatican was ``embarrassed'' by
Noriega's decision to seek refuge at its embassy and depicted it as
an opportunity to bring peace to the country.
   ``I can announce with satisfaction that the conflict in Panama
seems to be nearing a solution without further shedding of blood,''
he said in a four-paragraph statement. ``And this is good news for
Christmas Day.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the United States
would continue to seek ways to bring Noriega to the United States.
Asked if anyone would get the $1 million reward the Bush
administration offered for Noriega's capture, Fitzwater said, ``No,
I don't think so.''
   Gen. Maxwell Thurman, chief of the U.S. Southern Command, said
he ordered the Vatican Embassy surrounded after Noriega's surrender
to prevent Noriega supporters from ``blowing into the place. I
would not want them to come with an armored car and blow their way
into the embassy.''
   Noriega surfaced a few hours after three high-ranking members of
his Defense Forces surrendered and another pledged loyalty to the
U.S.-backed government.
   Witnesses said they saw several Noriega officials, including
former acting president Manuel Solis Palma, entering the embassy.
   The Italian news agency ANSA reported from Panama City that 32
people had sought asylum from the Vatican, including high officials
of the Panamanian Defense Forces and political parties of the
Noriega regime.
   Panamanians cheered as word spread that Noriega had turned
himself in. Hundreds congregated at the embassy.
   ``The man has fallen! He is gone!'' some shouted.
   A radio station went on the air with a nationalistic song called
``Patria'' (Fatherland), written and sung by Panamanian Ruben
Blades.
   ``Now we can have Christmas!' said one man in Panama City as he
grabbed a friend and hugged him. ``I don't have a turkey in the
house, we don't even have any hamburger. All we have is a can of
sardines, but what the hell!''
   Food and medical supplies were in short supply, and stores were
ransacked by looters.
   Combat from Noriega loyalists dwindled Sunday, but there was
fighting in the working-class San Miguelito district, one of those
where the pro-Noriega paramilitary Dignity Battalions are strongest.
   Thurman estimated the battalions number about 1,800. They have
been joined by an unknown number of Noriega's original
15,000-member Defense Forces.
   Murguia said today that 23 U.S. soldiers had been killed and 285
wounded since the invasion began. The Pentagon on Sunday said 25
U.S. soldiers were killed. It then changed that figure to 24,
saying one death had been counted twice.
   Murguia, in announcing his figures, said two deaths were counted
twice.
   The latest figures no longer listed a soldier as missing.
   Pentagon officials also said two American civilians had been
killed.
   Murguia said 290 ``enemy'' troops had been killed, 121 wounded
and 3,780 captured. It was not clear whether the figures included
both Defense Forces and Dignity Brigade personnel.
   Dr. Elmer Miranda, director of Santo Tomas Hospital, put the
Panamanian death toll at 260 and said many victims were civilians.

   The provisional government appealed
for a cease-fire today by pro-Ceausescu forces who killed thousands
in vicious weekend street battles. Christmas carols rang out for
the first time in 42 years.
   Scattered fighting was reported in Bucharest and other cities,
but public transit was back in operation in the capital three days
after hard-line Communist President Nicolae Ceausescu was
overthrown.
   There were reports that as many as 80,000 people had died and
300,000 were wounded since the popular revolt began Dec. 15.
Hungary's Budapest Radio and the British Broadcasting Corp.
reported the same figures Sunday night, quoting ``authoritative
sources in Bucharest'' but giving no details.
   The reports, like others on casualties, were impossible to
verify independently. But if accurate, the Romanian uprising would
be the bloodiest anti-Communist revolt ever, its death toll far
eclipsing that of the Hungarian revolution of 1956 in which about
30,000 people are believed to have lost their lives.
   Hungarian radio later quoted Victor Ciobanu, health minister
under Ceausescu and now in opposition to him, as denying that
70,000 or more had died but offering no overall casualty estimate.
   Ceausescu, who sternly ruled for 24 years and rejected the
reforms sweeping Eastern Europe, spent Christmas a prisoner of his
own army, awaiting trial for abuses of power.
   But members of the hated Securitate _ the security force
Ceausescu built to protect himself and his Stalinist regime _
fought for their lives in desperate street battles against the
army. Bodies piled up in Bucharest's morgues and hospitals.
   Four men believed to be Securitate agents were arrested by
Yugoslav police today after they crossed the Danube River that
forms the border between Yugoslavia and Romania, Belgrade radio
reported.
   While downtown Bucharest was generally quiet today, radio and
television reported fighting in the southwest suburb of Drumul
Taberei and around the Ministry of Defense building in the
capital's southeast. The reports gave no details on the clashes.
   Hungarian radio and Yugoslavia's Tanjug news agency also
reported fighting today in Timisoara, the western city where the
uprising began, as Ceausescu loyalists barricaded themselves inside
a militia building. Still, street cars and trolley buses resumed
service in Romania's fourth-largest city.
   Tanjug also reported serious fighting in Arad, near the
Hungarian border, and the central city of Sibiu, without giving
details. Sibiu was the former stronghold of Nicu Ceauescu, the son
of the deposed president.
   The National Salvation Committee, the provisional government,
appealed for a cease-fire, and ordered civilians to turn in their
arms today. It broadcast appeals to let the army fight the security
police, who were shooting from rooftops and apartment windows in
the capital and elsewhere.
   A member of the security police was arrested today outside
Bucharest's Mitropolia cathedral after members of a crowd shouted,
``We know this man, he's a terrorist!'' The man wore a bulletproof
vest and had a hand grenade.
   Radio Bucharest played Christmas songs and carols today, the
first time since the Communist takeover in December 1947, and it
reported on the positive foreign reaction to the uprising.
   In Rome, Pope John Paul II sought a special blessing for Romania
and prayed that the hope of Christmas may find fertile ground in
Eastern Europe, ``awakened from a nightmare.''
   A message from President Bush was read to the people over
Romanian radio and television, ``hoping for a peaceful passage to
democracy'' and deploring ``the tragic and senseless loss of human
lives'' since the revolt began.
   The Bush administration and the French government both said they
would not object if the Soviets or other Warsaw Pact nations use
their military forces to assist the uprising. The Soviets said such
a move was ``impermissible.''
   Thousands reportedly were massacred by security forces when they
opened fire on unarmed anti-government protesters in Timisoara on
Dec. 17. The revolt against Ceaucescu's harsh rule spread across
Romania and reached Bucharest Dec. 21, when student protesters
defied gunfire to chant their wish for freedom.
   Ceausescu, 71, fled his capital on Friday in a helicopter and
was captured Saturday with his wife, Elena, in an underground
bunker _ one of several prepared years earlier under his regime.
   Unlike his son, Nicu, and daughter, Zoia-Elena, who were paraded
before TV viewers after their arrests Friday and Sunday, Ceausescu
has not been seen since Ion Iliescu, a leader of the National
Salvation Committee, announced his arrest Saturday. The elder
Ceausescu was reported to be held at a military base.
   The National Salvation Committee pledged that the courts would
mete out punishments of ``the greatest severity'' to ``the dictator
and his former lackeys.''
   Romanian radio said secret police used scores of safe houses and
vast networks of tunnels in Bucharest and in Timisoara to store
weapons and launch attacks. Ceausescu's downtown palace was
connected to the maze of tunnels and contained a bunker designed to
resist nuclear attack, it said.
   At Bucharest's main Orthodox cathedral, Letitia Patrut mourned
the students who were killed by the security forces.
   ``These young people, how they sacrificed for us!'' she said.
``We must pray for these poor young people who defended the
people.''
   Security men who were driven from Parliament fired toward the
300-year-old Romanian Orthodox cathedral. ``They are devils,'' said
Bishop Nifon of Bucharest.
   A Belgian journalist, Danny Huwe of the commercial TV network
VTM, was killed in Bucharest while reporting on the fighting.
Turkish journalist Emre Aygen, was in grave condition today after
being shot twice shot in the head, VTM reported. A French
journalist was crushed to death by a tank Saturday.
   Associated Press correspondent John Daniszewski, New York Times
correspondent John Tagliabue and two European journalists were
wounded by gunfire in Timisoara late Saturday and early Sunday
before the security forces surrendered to army troops backing the
revolt.
   At Bucharest Emergency Hospital, doctors who have not slept in
three days said they had treated 2,000 civilians since Thursday, a
fraction of the city total.
   Bodies lay on the hospital's floors frozen in grotesque
positions, with identity papers taped to bare chests. Sobbing
people spent Christmas Eve looking for lost sons and brothers.
Victims included a pregnant woman and teen-agers.
   ``It is horrible murder,'' said Dr. Stephan Miliesescu, a
plastic surgeon who was working the emergency ward. He said victims
came in with single shots to the head from well-trained snipers.
   Doctors had to sedate and strap down one swarthy security guard,
who shouted that the revolt had upset Ceausescu's socialist
paradise. He yelled: ``You are criminals, and we will kill you
all!''

   Police on Monday defused a grenade
wrapped as a Christmas gift after the recipient discovered the
detonator ring protruding through the wrapping paper, officials
said.
   The package, wrapped in holiday paper, was delivered on
Christmas Day to the owner of a small hotel and rooming house in
the city's entertainment district, said police Lt. Edilberto
Capacete.
   As the owner was opening the gift, he noticed the grenade
detonator ring and called police, Capacete said. The motive for the
intended attack was unknown.
   Col. Ernesto Diokno, acting commander of the Western Police
District, said the grenade would probably have killed several
people had it exploded.

   Four men believed to be agents of

were arrested Monday in Yugoslavia, Belgrade radio reported.
   The four were part of a group of Romanian defectors who crossed
the Danube into Yugoslavia overnight at Kladovo, about 100 miles
east of Belgrade.
   ``It can be assumed with great certainty that they are members
of the Securitate'' _ the secret police, the broadcast said.
   Several other Romanians agents are believed to be hiding in the
hills around Kladovo, the radio said without elaborating.
   There was no immediate confirmation of the incident by police.

<HEAD>Facing Tough Restrictions, Scandinavian Smokers Fight Back</HEAD>

   Shoved into corners, banned from local
flights and excluded from some hotel floors, smokers in Scandinavia
say they have had enough and are beginning to fight back.
   Smokers have banded together in Sweden, Norway, Finland and
Denmark to combat perceived discrimination, to lobby against new
anti-smoking laws and to share tricks to sneak a smoke against the
rules.
   ``We want to protect smokers' rights. We don't want to encourage
people to smoke, especially not young people,'' said Bengt Oste,
chairman of the Swedish lobby Smokepeace.
   ``Too many smoking bans were coming from all over the place. It
was about time somebody did something about it,'' said Tore Dinesen
of the Danish smokers' organization, Henry.
   In their latest action, the pro-smoke groups published a
pamphlet on how to avoid the smoking bans on local flights by
Finnair and SAS, the Scandinavian Airlines System. The rule was
extended Nov. 1 to any international flight less than 100 minutes
long on these airlines.
   The ``Smokers' Guide To Smokers' Flights in the Nordic Area''
lists flights by other airlines with smoking sections that have
stopovers in the region.
   To get to Copenhagen from Helsinki, the pamphlet says, a
traveler can fly Pan Am to Stockholm and transfer to a Soviet
Aeroflot aircraft to the Danish capital. A heavy smoker might have
time for two cigarettes on each leg.
   Finnair claims it was the first airline to introduce non-smoking
seats more than 20 years ago.
   Smokepeace, which adopted the symbol of an Indian in feathered
headdress puffing a peace pipe, says it just wants a fair deal for
smokers and non-smokers.
   In 10 months it has drawn 1,500 members. Some are non-smokers
offended by discrimination, Oste said, and 53 percent are women.
   ``Smokers have to back down a bit, so as not to harm or irritate
non-smokers,'' said Oste, an anchorman for Swedish TV news who says
he has been a pipe smoker for 45 years.
   At the same time, fair provision should be made for smokers, he
said. ``Too often, company managers and politicians are making
decisions without asking workers,'' Oste said.
   Henry, launched two years ago by a Danish wine and tobacco
merchant, enlisted Denmark's pipe-smoking Foreign Minister Uffe
Ellemann-Jensen in an advertising campaign last spring to plead
that ``tolerance and consideration are the basis of living
together.''
   Although it doesn't release financial figures, Henry reportedly
gets part of its finances from the Danish tobacco industry.
   Norway has enacted some of the world's toughest anti-smoking
laws, which critics say make lighting a cigarette indoors illegal
almost everywhere except at home.
   Sweden's parliament is in the early stage of drafting a new
comprehensive law, which many legislators want to fashion on the
Norwegian model. Steps toward a similar bill in Denmark were
interrupted by an election and have been dropped for now.
   Among Norway's regulations is a ban on smoking in any office
occupied by more than one person, even if everyone in the room is a
smoker.
   Smoking was outlawed in schools, hospitals, theater lobbies and
public transportation. Selling tobacco to youths under 18 is
illegal.
   Many Scandinavian hotels have no-smoking rooms, and some have
barred tobacco from entire floors.
   Most work places have set aside smoking areas. The Stockholm
daily Aftonbladet banned smoking anywhere in its new nine-story
building except in a few glassed-in rooms by the coffee machines on
each floor. They are so poorly ventilated that workers refer to
them as ``the gas chambers.''
   High tobacco taxes also are meant to deter. In Norway cigarettes
cost about $4 a pack, slightly more than in the other countries.
Roll-your-own tobacco is becoming more popular in Denmark, where
pipe tobacco has less tax.
   One dodge from smoking bans is snuff, a plug of tobacco that
many Scandinavians stick under their upper lip.
   The government in Oslo adopted an ambitious and, critics say,
unrealistic target of making Norway smoke-free by the end of the
century.
   The critics note that although tobacco has not been advertised
since 1973, four out of 10 Norwegians smoke and consumption is
rising by 500 tons of tobacco a year.
   The other governments have gone no farther than to endorse the
World Health Organization's goal to reduce smoking by 25 percent in
the next 10 years.

<HEAD>Speeder Gets His $11,000 Ticket Reduced, Still Says System is Fair</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A 41-year-old businessman fought for
four months to get his $11,400 speeding fine reduced to $1,050, but
he still says Finland's traditional system of punishment based on a
person's wealth is fair.
   Police in August nabbed Rainer Rooth for driving his BMW 75 mph
in a 50 mph zone, and tax authorities set the $11,400 fine based on
his 1987 income.
   Penalties for exceeding the speed limit by more than 10 mph are
based on what the offender says is his annual income. The minimum
is $5.
   The principle of paying fines according to earnings has been
around for years, and Finns say the fine is the fairest way to
punish offenders. Even Rooth, who may have received the highest
fine on record, doesn't argue with it.
   ``I think the system is just, but there has to be some kind of
limit,'' said Rooth, who built a tourist attaction based on the
Wild West.
   When ticketed, Rooth told police he was getting no income from
his business, which was heavily in debt.
   The case went to the tax authorities, who ruled that Rooth's
earnings in 1987 was roughly $300,000 and set the fine at $11,400.
Rooth protested, and the case was twice adjourned.
   ``I didn't earn that kind of money when the offense occurred,''
Rooth said in an interview.
   On Wednesday, the court reduced the fine to $1,050. Rooth
estimated he paid at least $3,000 with legal costs included.
   ``I tell you, the taxman was after me, it's as simple as that.
The new fine is still not right, but I can live with it. Another
appeal would probably cost just as much,'' he said.
   Kauko Aromaa, a Justice Minstry researcher, said the system of
fines based on income was a ``just way to punish people.''
   The ``day-fine'' is at most one-third of an offender's daily
income based, on gross annual earnings. The number of day-fines an
offender is given is determined by the severity of the offense.
Rooth was given 27 day-fines for his high-speed driving.
   In 1987, the day-fine system was used in 350,000 cases ranging
from traffic offenses, burglaries, drunken driving, embezzlement
and assault.
   Police admit the system has flaws.
   ``Sure, we know that most of those we stop in a speed trap lie
about their pay, but we can't check them all. But mostly, if they
make it credible enough, we won't doubt it,'' said Antti Kivela,
duty officer at the Helsinki Traffic Police Department.
   ``Obviously, when someone who drives a big BMW says he doesn't
have a source of income we are going to suspect something _ that
guy was asking for it,'' Kivela said of Rooth.
   Kivela said that the average speeding fine around Helsinki is
from $120 to $240, but $1,000 fines were not uncommon.
   In a widely publicized case last year, a northern court rejected
as too low the fine given to Matti Ahde, who was then Parliament
speaker.
   A quick check found that he lied about his income.
   ``Sure there's a loophole in the system. It is almost as if we
are challenging people to give wrong information because it's not a
crime to lie about your income to the police,'' said Aromaa.

<HEAD>Trial Ordered for Colonel Who Ordered Beatings of Palestinians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LOUIS MEIXLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The army Monday ordered the court-martial of an
Israeli colonel accused of telling troops to break the bones of 20
bound and gagged Palestinian prisoners.
   Col. Yehuda Meir will be the highest ranking officer to face
trial during the 2-year-old Palestinian uprising against Israeli
occupation, and the proceedings are expected to touch off debate
over the military's orders concerning the beating of Palestinians.
   In related developments Monday, a pathologist disclosed that a
Palestinian prisoner died while in the custody of the secret
police, and the military said an Israeli coronel would be indicted
for a shooting in which a 15-year-old Palestinian was killed.
   The army announcement to prosecute Meir came one day after the
Supreme Court overturned the military's decision not to press
charges. The announcement gave no date for the trial.
   Meir was reprimanded by Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, the armed forces
chief of staff, for the January 1988 incident and given the choice
of leaving the army or standing trial. Meir, the former military
commander in the occupied West Bank city of Nablus, resigned in
April.
   The army's chief prosecutor, Brig. Gen. Amnon Straschnow, had
argued that Meir's dismissal from the army was adequate punishment
and trying the coronel would be difficult because the army's orders
on the use of force were ``foggy.''
   Testimony in trials of other soldiers showed that at the time
army orders allowed soldiers to beat stone-throwers to deter
further acts. The orders have since been changed to ban such
beatings.
   The independent Maariv newspaper, quoting military sources, said
Straschnow may resign after the Supreme Court rejected his decision
and accepted the appeal by four Palestinians and the Association
for Civil Rights in Israel.
   Justice Yaakov Kadmi wrote that Meir's orders to beat
Palestinian detainees ``stands in complete contradiction to the
basic foundations of the nation of Israel.''
   Meir is accused of ordering troops to beat and break the legs of
20 bound and gagged Palestinians from the nearby towns of Hawara
and Beita.
   Soldiers under his command left beaten and bound Palestinians in
a field until other Arabs arrived and rushed then to a hospital.
   He was also investigated in connection with an incident in which
troops beat two Palestinian teenagers in Nablus. The incident was
filmed by a U.S. television crew.
   The military disclosed Monday that Straschnow decided last week
to indict an unidentified colonel for firing plastic bullets in
violation of army orders and fatally wounding a 15-year-old Gazan
five months ago.
   Also Monday, pathologist Michael Baden said a prisoner from the
occupied Gaza Strip died from internal bleeding caused by blows to
the abdomen.
   Baden, who works for the New York City police department, was
called as an independent investigator by the family of Khaled Kamel
Sheikh Ali. Ali, 27, was found dead Dec. 19 in his prison cell
while in the custody of the Shin Bet secret service.
   Baden questioned five Shin Bet investigators who were involved
in Ali's interrogation, Israel radio said.

<HEAD>Aquino Calls For Unity, Filipinos Light Candles For Peace</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT H. REID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino called on
Filipinos in a Christmas message to join together to help the
country recover from the most recent coup attempt. Thousands of
people lighted candles in a plea for peace.
   ``The candles we will be lighting as one symbolize the longing
of the ordinary citizen for peace and tranquility and his
repudiation of violence as an instrument of power,'' The Manila
Chronicle said in a front-page editorial.
   Mrs. Aquino said the Dec. 1-9 coup attempt tarnished the
country's reputation and stalled efforts to improve the economy
still suffering from 20 years of rule under former President
Ferdinand Marcos.
   ``What we need to do today is to join hands so that we can
regain the momentum that we lost, so that we can heal the wounds
that were inflicted upon us,'' Mrs. Aquino said.
   Marcos was ousted in a February 1986 military-civilian uprising
that propelled Mrs. Aquino to power. Marcos died in September in
exile in Hawaii.
   In another statement Monday, the Central Committee of the banned
Communist Party of the Philippines blamed the December coup attempt
on Mrs. Aquino's failure to solve the country's economic, social
and political problems.
   The party claimed the country was drifting toward a new era of
repression because of the growing influence of the military faction
that has quelled six coup attempts during the Aquino administration.
   The December coup try was the worst, leaving at least 113 people
dead.
   ``The recent upsurge of popular unrest owing to the worsening
political and economic crisis, the military rebellion in December,
and the shameless manner in which the Aquino regime asked for U.S.
succor to quell the rebellion have dramatically ... exposed its
ineptitude to rule,'' the party said in a statement distributed to
news organizations.
   The statement was issued to mark the 21st anniversary of the
Communist Party of the Philippines, founded Dec. 26, 1968.
   Thousands of candles flickered in front of homes, businesses and
military camps across the politically troubled land.
   The nationwide candle-lighting ceremony was organized by
entertainer Danny Javier in a bid to forge national unity in the
wake of the coup and amid insurgencies by Marxist and Moslem rebels.
   People were urged to place one candle in front of their home for
each member of the household as a gesture of peace and national
reconciliation. Hundreds of thousands of Filipinos also crowded
churches in Asia's only predominately Christian country to pray for
peace.
   In his Christmas message, Roman Catholic Cardinal Jaime L. Sin
said violence had drowned out the ``song of peace and good will
that was sung by the heavenly choir over Bethlehem on that first
Christmas.''

<HEAD>Tax Forms Ready For Mailing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Along with late greeting cards and Christmas
bills, more than 107 million American households will get unwelcome
mail from the Internal Revenue Service starting Tuesday _ their
annual tax forms.
   The mass mailing of tax packages, which carries a $26 million
pricetag for printing and postage, is conducted every year
immediately after Christmas.
   Some taxpayers may already have received their forms, because
their local postmaster jumped the gun. The forms have been sitting
in post offices with IRS instructions not to mail them until after
Christmas, but every year some postmasters send them early anyway.
   In an effort to reassure jittery taxpayers, officials are
stressing that the forms contain few changes. But much to the
chagrin of the IRS, one of the changes should not have been made.
   The problem involves the catastrophic health program, which
Congress voted to repeal in November after a revolt among the
elderly who would have had to foot the bill. The wealthiest senior
citizens would have faced an added tax burden of $800.
   The tax liability was abolished along with the decision to scrap
the program. However, the congressional action came too late to
change the tax forms, which were printed up in October with
outdated information about the now obsolete tax.
   The IRS hopes to keep confusion to a minimum with a publicity
campaign. Also, no form exists for taxpayers to compute their
liability under the catastrophic program.
   If some taxpayers still fail to receive the word and include an
amount on the line for the Medicare premium, the IRS says it will
refund the money. IRS official Arthur Altman estimated 12 million
elderly taxpayers could be led astray.
   The IRS said this year's forms, which should be in most homes
before New Year's Day, will offer relatively minor changes.
   Among them:
   _ The personal exemption, the amount you may exempt from
taxation for yourself, your spouse and each dependent, increases to
$2,000 per person, up from $1,950 last year.
   _ The standard deduction, claimed by people who do not itemize,
rises to $3,100 for a single person, up from $3,000 last year,
while the exemption for a couple increases to $5,200, up from
$5,000 last year.
   _ Tax rates remain the same at 15 percent, 28 percent and 33
percent, but the tax brackets have been widened so that more income
will be taxed at a lower rate, thus compensating for the impact of
inflation.
   _ Bowing to the increase in separate last names for husband and
wife, the IRS for the first time will include two lines, instead of
one, so that spouses filing a joint return can enter their names
and Social Security numbers on separate lines.
   _ Taxpayers must show the Social Security number for any
dependent they claim who is age 2 or older. Last year, the cutoff
was age 5.
   _ Families with income as high as $19,340 may qualify for an
earned-income credit, up from a limit of $18,576 last year.
   _ In one of the few changes with an adverse impact, only 20
percent of interest paid on credit card debt, auto loans and other
personal debt will be deductible on 1989 returns, down from 40
percent last year.
   The tax forms must be filed this year by April 16, one day later
than normal because April 15 falls on a Sunday.
   The IRS expects about 111.2 million individual income tax
returns will be filed for the 1989 tax year. The majority of
taxpayers, 65 percent, will end up using the comprehensive Form
1040, designed for taxpayers who itemize or who have incomes above
$50,000 annually.
   The rest who do not itemize and meet other qualifications can
file the more simple Form 1040A or the simplest of all, the
nine-line Form 1040EZ. The form a taxpayer receives in the mail is
based on the form the taxpayer used last year.
   All the tax forms come with a pitch from new IRS Commissioner
Fred T. Goldberg Jr. urging taxpayers to consider filing their
returns electronically.
   Offered this year for the first time nationwide, electronic
filing features the advantage of cutting down the time required to
process refund checks to three weeks, compared to the normal six to
10 weeks.
   In 1988, two-thirds of all taxpayers qualified for a refund with
the average refund totaling $875.
   The IRS hopes that 2 million taxpayers will file their returns
electronically this year and it is providing a toll free telephone
number, 1-800-424-1040, for people to call for a list of tax
preparers in their area who have the capability of filing returns
electronically.

   National drug control policy director William
J. Bennett cited 20 people ``on the true front lines'' of the war
on drugs for their grass roots efforts, proving that ``It is
possible to fight back _ even to win.''
   ``These people are not angels,'' Bennett said in a statement
released Monday. ``They are not saints. They are men and women who
have seen their communities ravaged by drugs and they have decided
to act.
   ``These Americans have figured out what armchair critics have
not. It is possible to fight back _ even to win.''
   Bennett said he met those cited during his travels to some three
dozen cities throughout the country since the drug control strategy
he developed was presented to the nation by President Bush on Sept.
5.
   The 20, with background from the Office of National Drug Control
Policy, are:
   _Robert Armstrong, director of the Omaha Housing Authority, who
``implemented non-nosense eviction policies and went after known
pushers'' whom, he said, ``nobody else wanted to touch. Once we got
'em out, the other residents knew we were serious, and they
appreciated it.''
   _Alvin Brooks, founder of the Ad Hoc Group Against Crime in
Kansas City, Mo., also helped start Black Men Together, which is
intended to offer role models for young blacks. Members of Black
Men Together walk some drug-infested streets, toting bull horns and
warning drug dealers to get off the street.
   _Jack Candelaria, president of the South San Jose Neighborhood
Association in Albuquerque, N.M., who brought members of his group
together with police to win establishment of a police sub-station
in the neighborhood. Today, police and residents work closely
together, and Police Chief Sam Baca said, ``months will go by when
the police don't receive calls about drug pushing in the
neighborhood'' which was once overrun by dealers.
   _The Rev. George Clements, pastor of Holy Angels Church and
School in Chicago, who led a boycott of stores in Chicago's South
Side selling drug paraphernalia after he found that all of his
parishioners had relatives who were either hooked on drugs or had
died because of them. Despite death threats, Clements said, ``We,
the citizens, have to get out there and let people know that we
really mean business. ... There are more of us than there are of
them. Their only weapon is fear. They've conned us into thinking
they're invincible. They're not. They're cowards, and once the
community stands up against them, they tuck their tails between
their legs and run.''
   _Dorothy Davis, organizer of STOP Crime Watch in Dallas, and
Assistant Chief of Police Sam Gonzales. Davis started STOP Crime
Watch after a 12-year-old girl was killed by drug violence in 1988.
The grass roots anti-crime and anti-drug organization has helped
city police and other city agencies in Operation CLEAN, Community
and Law Enforcement Against Narcotics, an effort to root out drug
offenders from targeted residential neighborhoods.
   _Edward Johnson, organizer of the Fairlawn Coalition in
Washington, D.C., which patrols the streets of the tough Anacostia
section. Members wear bright orange baseball caps, carry radios,
video cameras and binoculars and confront drug dealers and users
with stares instead of verbal or physical confrontation. They have
driven the drug buyers out, according to coalition founder James
Foreman. ``This is one program where police and citizens working
together bring people closer to law enforcement and let people see
that police are human,'' Johnson said. ``The police know that the
people here will give them water or coffee and help them to do
their job better.''
   _Ray Leary and Tony Hopson, directors of Self Enhancement, Inc.,
in Portland, Ore., a program designed to provide young people with
alternatives to gang and drug involvement. ``We want to show
children that there is a sense of value to their lives,'' Leary
said.
   _The Rev. Michael Lewis of Faith House, Inc., in Tampa, Fla.,
one of the first black child placement agencies in that state to
deal exclusively with cocaine and AIDS babies. ``We took a crack
house and turned it into a faith house,'' said Lewis, where foster
parents are recruited and trained.

<HEAD>Text of Pope's Christmas Message</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-World Christmas, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Vatican's official English translation
of the annual Christmas Day message ``Urbi et Orbi'' _ ``to the
city and to the world'' _ from Pope John Paul II:
   ``He gave power to become children of God'' (John 1:12). Today
is the Solemnity of Christmas. The eyes of our soul see the Child,
laid in the manger.
   The gaze of our faith rests upon the words of the Prologue of
John: ``To all who received him, he gave the power to become
children of God.''
   We bless you, Son of Man, who are the Eternal Word.
   Glory to the Father who has given You, his Only-Begotten, to us.
Glory to the Spirit, who proceeds from the Father and from You, O
Son of God.
   Glory to the ageless mystery, which embraces all things.
   In this night, that mystery has drawn close to mankind: it has
entered mankind's life and history. It has passed the threshold of
our human existence.
   The child wrapped in swaddling clothes and laid in a manger. The
helpless human child _ and at the same time, the power which
transcends all that man is, all that he can accomplish. For man
cannot become like God through his own efforts _ as history has
made clear, from the beginning.
   And yet, man can become like God through God's own power. This
power is in the Son, the eternal word, who ``became flesh and dwelt
among us'' (John 1:14).
   Today is the first day of his sojourn in our midst.
   ``He was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet
the world knew him not. He came to his own home, but his own people
received him not.
   ``But to all who received him, he gave power to beome children
of God; who were born ... of God'' (John 1:10-13).
   History continues on its way, countless men and women, nations,
peoples, languages, races, cultures, millions upon millions...yet
he is unique: laid now as a child in the manger (``there was no
room ... in the inn'') and later upon the cross. He, and none other.
   And then, risen _ He, and none other.
   How many have received him not? How many still receive him not?
How many know of him? How many do not?
   We would like to measure with human statistics, how far this
power reaches, the power which is in Him. Born, crucified, risen.
   We would like to know, humanly speaking, how many have become,
in him and through him, children of God _ children in the Son.
   But human measurements cannot fathom the mystery of God.
   They cannot fathom the gift of God's birth, present in the
history of mankind, present in the history of the world, at work in
human souls through the power of the spirit, the giver of life.
   ``All the ends of the earth have seen the victory of our God''
(Psalms 98:3).
   Yes. The shepherds of Bethlehem came, and they saw.
   Yes. The Wise Men from the East came, and they saw.
   And the aged Simeon and the prophetess Anna saw, in the Temple
at Jerusalem.
   Just how do the ends of the earth see You, O Word Incarnate?
   Because you are for everyone. The salvation of our God is for
everyone, and it comes through You.
   God ``desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge
of the truth'' (1 Tm 2:4).
   Truth is through you. And grace as well. You are the truth. You
are the Way and the life (cf. John 14:6). And even though your own
people received you not ... even though there was not room for you
at the inn ... in you God has received ... God has received each
one of us.
   In you, God has received us as well, the men and women of the
second millenium, now hastening to its end.
   He has not regarded our contradictions, our infidelities, our
inconsistencies.
   Indeed, he has sent You, his Word, to heal us of them. To tell
us that, by taking the road we are taking, we are racing towards
self-destruction.
   The world longs for peace: yet every day our brothers and
sisters are dying in the present conflicts, in Lebanon, in the Holy
Land, in Central America; they are dying in fratricidal struggles
for supremacy: racial, ideological, economic; they are dying
because of senseless and reckless courses of action.
   The world longs for reconciliation: yet every day thousands of
refugees are abandoned and rejected; ethnic and religious
minorities go neglected in their basic needs; whole groups are kept
on the margins of society in ever-growing isolation.
   The world longs for balance, both within and without: yet every
day the environment becomes more polluted for reasons of
self-interest or from lack of concern.
   The message of truth and grace which comes to us at Christmas
through You must touch each of us. That message is for us, because
You have come for us, You have become one of us. Make us receive
You, O eternal Word of the Father!
   May the world receive You. Awaken in hearts the rejection of all
barriers be they of race, ideology, or intolerance. Guide the
negotiations now under way for arms reduction and control.
   Strengthen all who strive for an end to the hostilities that
have continued for all too long in Africa and in Asia, so that the
peoples involved may regain their freedom and their rights through
frank and trusting dialogue.
   And may this old Europe of ours also receive You, O Word
Incarnate! Deep within her she carries the imprint of your Gospel,
from which she has derived her culture, her art, her concept of the
inviolable dignity of man.
   May this Europe open her doors and her heart to understand and
receive the anxieties, the fears and the problems of the Nations
which seek her help.
   May she respond with the strength and the generosity of her
Christan roots to this very special moment of history _ a true
Kairos of God's Providence _ which the world is now experiencing,
as if awakened from a nightmare and opened up to a better hope.
   In particular, bless at this hour, O Lord, the noble land of
Romania, which is celebrating this Christmas in fear and trembling,
with sorrow for the many human lives tragically lost and in the joy
of having taken once more the path of freedom.
   Brothers and Sisters present here. Brothers and Sisters,
listening to me by radio and television, on every continent.
   Come to the crib of the helpless child, who is the Power of God.
He is born for us. Come ... and you will see ... and you will be
received, for today there have been revealed God's goodness and His
love for mankind.

<TEXT>
   Iran released 50 ailing or disabled Iraqi
prisoners of war Monday to Red Cross representatives as a gesture
of good will, Tehran radio reported.
   It was not clear whether Iraq would reciprocate and release some
of the Iranian POWs it holds. An earlier attempt to arrange a
formal swap collapsed.
   The radio said the prisoners were released in Tehran to the Red
Cross for eventual repatriation.
   Tehran radio, monitored in Cyprus, quoted a Foreign Ministry
statement as saying the 50 were freed on humanitarian grounds and
in response to a request by U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar.
   It did not say when Perez de Cuellar made the appeal. But
Baghdad last week sent a memorandum to the U.N. chief expressing
concern over POWs in Iran after a Red Cross report on Dec. 6 that
22 Iraqis have died in jail.
   The deaths were attributed to ``heart attacks and relevant
diseases,'' but Iraqi media suggested the prisoners might have been
tortured to death.
   The Red Cross has registered 50,000 prisoners held by Iran and
more than 19,200 in Iraqi camps. United Nations officials and
diplomats estimate the two sides hold about 100,000 POWs between
them.
   The Red Cross secured an agreement to repatriate ailing
prisoners immediately after a U.N.-cease-fire halted the war on
Aug.20, 1988. The deal collapsed after the repatriation of only 400
disabled and wounded prisoners, with both sides accusing each other
of falsifying the number of captives seeking asylum.
   Angelo Gnadinger, Middle East chief for the Red Cross, visited
Tehran and Baghdad last week seeking a swap of the remaining 1,000
wounded and disabled POWs held by both sides.
   The mediation collapsed, mainly because Tehran insisted the
exchange be coupled with a withdrawalof Iraqi forces from chunks of
land they occupied in the final weeks of the war.
   U.N.-sponsored peace talks have been deadlocked mainly over the
troop withdrawal issue and Iraq's demand for redrawing the border
to give it full sovereignty over the Shatt-Al-Arab waterway.
   The channel, a confluence of the great Tigris and Euphrates
rivers, is Iraq's sole outlet to the Persian Gulf. Before the war,
the border ran down the middle of Shatt-Al-Arab.

   Firefighters today found a 16th body
after a fire swept through a high-rise retirement home, and 11
residents who had been listed as missing were believed to be all
safe.
   ``All those have been confirmed. They have been found,'' fire
chief Doug Buckles said at a news conference this morning.
   Officials said 10 of those who had been unaccounted-for had been
located spending the holiday with relatives or friends and the
remaining person was believed to be with relatives out of state.
   City safety officials said at the news conference that the cause
of the fire was still unknown, but it was believed to have been
accidental.
   The Christmas Eve fire injured 51 people, including about 25
firefighters, authorities said.
   About 145 people were living at the 11-story John Sevier
Retirement Center.
   ``It was terrible last night. It was a terrible ordeal,'' Samuel
E. Williams, 52, said this morning after Red Cross volunteers
served him breakfast at a motel where he and 16 other survivors
were given temporary shelter.
   Williams said he escaped his third-floor apartment through
billowing smoke.
   ``What really got to me, after we were out on the street and
looking up,'' he said, ``we saw people laying out their windows,
saying, `Help me!' And we couldn't help them.''
   Christmas Eve fires killed at least 32 people in five other
states. Among the dead were six people at a holiday family reunion
in Atlanta; a mother and four daughters in a Dallas suburb; four
members of a Pittsburgh family; and a woman and her three children
in upstate New York.
   Firefighters in Manchester, N.H., wept as they tried to revive
three children who died in an apartment-building fire. Their mother
died later at a hospital. Elsewhere in the state, one man died in a
house fire in Londonderry.
   Also in the New Hampshire city on Sunday, faulty wiring in a
chapel's Nativity scene sparked a fire in a convent nursing home.
Firefighters rescued 26 elderly nuns, two of whom were hospitalized
in satisfactory condition.
   And today, three young boys were killed at Zanesville, Ohio,
when fire destroyed their home. Frozen fire hydrants slowed
firefighters. And a fire believed started when a heater ignited a
Christmas tree killed four young children and seriously burned
their parents in Hammond, La., firefighters said.
   In Johnson City, about 100 miles northeast of Knoxville,
authorities confirmed 15 deaths Sunday night, and a search turned
up a 16th body early this morning, said Police Maj. Ron Street.
   A temporary morgue was set up at the Downtown Centre Courthouse.
   It took more than six hours to bring the fire under control.
   Fire Chief Doug Buckles said the building had a history of false
fire alarms, which may have caused some residents to fail to
evacuate promptly.
   ``We grieve for the families,'' City Manager John Campbell said.
   C.F. Harris, 78, escaped the fiery building, where he lived on
the first floor.
   ``What I'm going to do now? ... My heart medication is in
there,'' Harris said.
   It was the second fire in as many months at the building, which
was renovated about 10 years ago to bring it up to new safety
codes, Campbell said. The first fire was contained to one unit.
   ``The building does not have a sprinkler system, but it does
have a standpipe system at every floor,'' he said.
   ``We've been worried about this facility for some time,'' he
said. ``Not because there is anything wrong with the building, but
when you have that many people in a (high-rise) building, there is
always cause for concern.''
   About 25 firefighters were treated first for smoke inhalation
and later for frostbite, hospital officials said.
   Officials said 26 others were admitted to hospitals, where they
were treated for mostly smoke inhalation. At least one person
suffered serious burns, said Dan Blevins, spokesman for Northside
Hospital.
   In Atlanta, fire gutted a one-story wood frame home, leaving
relatives who gathered for the reunion stricken, grieving and
homeless.
   ``We were all there for a family Christmas. Now, five of my
relatives are dead, and the others lost everything,'' said family
member Juanita McColumn. Another body was found later.
   In Manchester, N.H., about 35 firefighters rushed into a burning
apartment building and found a mother and her two boys and a girl,
ages 2 to 5, dead.
   ``It was a devastating sight,'' said Norman Chaput, district
fire chief. ``The firefighters were carrying the children out, and
they were crying while they were giving them mouth-to-mouth.''
   In other Christmas Eve fires:
   _In the Dallas suburb of Garland, a 31-year-old mother and four
daughters, ages 2 to 9, died when a fire that apparently began
around a Christmas tree engulfed their home.
   _In Pittsburgh, fire tore through a home, killing a 60-year-old
man, his 26-year-old daughter and two grandchildren. Eight other
relatives were injured, two critically and three seriously.
   _In Little Falls, N.Y., Robert E. Thomas struggled to save his
family through a rear door of their burning trailer home, but his
27-year-old wife and their three sons, ages 2 to 6, died.
   ``He thought he kept hearing (son) Robby's voice calling `Daddy'
through the door. He kept yelling `Help me, help me get my babies
out!''' next-door neighbor Theresa Gressler said.
   Fires also killed four people in Swan Lake, N.Y.; one person in
Albany, N.Y., and a woman and her two children in Conshohocken, Pa.

   Back in Washington, the brass was saying
how the landing zone was clear _ not a ``hot L-Z'' at all, thanks
to the proficiency of new Stealth fighter planes. But the GIs on
the ground told a different story.
   Excited from their first taste of combat, the soldiers described
how one paratrooper was shot in the door of his C-130 aircraft as
he prepared to jump; his Ranger comrades had to pull him back to
save his life.
   A little incident among many, demonstrating anew the primary law
of conflict: Even in a little war, the truth is an early casualty.
   The Pentagon said that forces defending this Panamanian army
compound were quickly subdued because U.S. Stealth jets slipped
past radar and bombed a nearby field to provide a distraction. Yet
U.S. paratroopers who took this Panamanian army compound said they
landed amid an intense firefight which claimed several American
lives and more than a dozen U.S. wounded.

   Near Panama City was the ``Witch House,'' a modest residence
where Manuel Noriega was said to have kept his four Brazilian
voodoo witches.
   Soldiers said they apparently just missed getting the witches
themselves when they crashed into the house during Wednesday's
attack. But the evidence of the strange rituals which took place
there remained: a bucket of blood, animal entrails, and a variety
of seemingly random religious artifacts carefully arranged on the
desk.
   Before reporters were allowed in, the military removed what
soldiers said were packets of cocaine wrapped in tropical leaves.
Soldiers who confiscated the stockpile described their haul as
about 50 pounds of cocaine.
   At headquarters and in Washington, the generals said it was 50
kilograms. At 2.2 pounds per kilo, that would better back up the
U.S. claim that Noriega was involved heavily in the drug trade.
   It was possible the generals were referring to cocaine also
recovered elsewhere, but reporters never were able to reconcile the
figures.

   Perhaps the most difficult term to grasp in the war area was the
word ``secure,'' as in, ``the area has been secured.''
   Early Thursday, reporters were told the area around the Marriott
hotel on the east side of Panama City was secured. But within
hours, an attempt to land a helicopter containing a news group at
nearby Patilla airport was waved off because of a firefight.
   The Southern Command headquarters also was supposed to be secure
when, on Thursday afternoon, a new battle erupted there.
   The area that was one of the first attacked and secured
Wednesday was that of the Commandancia, Noriega's downtown
headquarters. But reporters visiting the area Friday were told of
new sniper fire from the charred and shattered high rises.
   Soldiers nervously patrolled the streets while local residents
brazenly looted what was left in the buildings.
   One GI showed reporters a motorized, two-person tricycle with a
machine-gun mount in back. It was operated by Noreiga defenders to
whiz through the streets and fire upon the attacking Americans _
until they came in the crosshairs a U.S. soldier's M-60 machine gun.
   The GI proudly showed the spot a few yards away where the
Panamanian gunner's brains had landed.
   On Avenue A nearby, a young Panamanian man waved at the U.S.
troops trying to get their attention. He failed until he came up
with a grabber: he walked out and placed a live rocket-propelled
grenade round in the middle of the street.
   It seemed there was little security in the term secure.

<HEAD>Cambodians Pray on Christmas, 11 Years After Invasion</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-World Christmas, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ENG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SITE B, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 200 Cambodians prayed for peace on
Christmas Day in their refugee camp in Thailand, exactly 11 years
after Vietnam invaded their homeland and sparked the civil war that
forced them to flee.
   ``I pray to God that I can go back to my country,'' said Sau
Rany, 22, a religion teacher who wants to be a nun.
   Inside a church of bamboo and palm leaves, she and other
refugees paid respect at an altar with a traditional Cambodian
greeting: hands folded before their faces. Besides the altar
drooped a Christmas tree with a cellophane star and plastic
flowers. No Mass was offered since there are no priests among the
refugees, and the foreign priests were away.
   Sau Rany's father and her brother were killed by the Khmer
Rouge, and she fled to the U.N.-aided guerrilla camp in 1984
because of food shortages and other hardships. She said God allows
her suffering ``probably to test my endurance.''
   Vietnamese divisions invaded Cambodia on Dec. 25, 1978, ending
nearly four years of Khmer Rouge rule and installing another
communist government. The U.N. border camps hold more than 300,000
refugees from the conflict.
   The war between the Phnom Penh government and a three-party
guerrilla coalition dominated by the Khmer Rouge has intensified
since Vietnam's troop pullout in late September.
   Almost all those at the church were women and their children.
``Usually we have more men here but today they are carrying weapons
and food at the border,'' Sau Rany explained.
   One soldier, Bith Phonn, 42, made it to church after taking
leave to look after his wife, eight months pregnant with their
ninth child.
   Bith Phonn displayed the scars from bullet wounds in both thighs
and the back of his head. He said he has killed about 10 enemy
soldiers in six years of fighting.
   ``I know it is a sin, but if I don't kill him, he will kill
me,'' he said.
   Relief officials and diplomats say that Prince Norodom
Sihanouk's group, which controls Site B, has stepped up
conscription because the United States and other countries are
supplying aid to the guerrilla armies depending on their size.
   The U.N. Border Relief Operation and the International
commuittee of the Red Cross have told Sihanouk officials they
oppose what appear to be efforts to conscript minors.
   One aid officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a
large group of students, some as young as 14, were taken out of the
camp in August and earlier this month for military help.
   The deputy Sihanouk administrator at Site B, Kun Kim Teng,
claimed Sunday that all those involved were 18 or older. He said
the students went for political, not military, training in August,
and those who left this month were carrying food to civilians in
newly liberated areas near the Thai border.
   All were volunteers, he said.

unprecedented declaration of independence from the Kremlin, a
source said.
   The source, one of the more than 250 members of the party's
policy-making Central Committee, said the committee would resume
its plenary meeting on the question Tuesday.
   ``They decided to think it over and start again,'' said the
high-ranking party official, who spoke on condition he not be
identified.
   Lithuanian Communists voted Wednesday at a special congress in
their capital of Vilnius to form their own party, rejecting appeals
for unity from President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other top Soviet
officials.
   The Lithuanians' break is serious because it is without
precedent in the history of the party founded by Vladimir I. Lenin,
who demanded and forged a unitary party across the Soviet Union.
   Moreover, Lithuanian reformers predict local party organizations
in many of the other 14 constituent Soviet republics will rapidly
follow their example, which would present Gorbachev with a
fractured party as he prepares for a nationwide party congress in
October 1990.
   The Central Committee convened in Moscow on Monday ``to consider
the situation in the Lithuanian party branch,'' state-run Radio
Moscow said. Other official media did not immediately report on the
closed-door session.
   Algirdas Brazauskas, the Lithuanian party leader, said the
break, which included drafting a separate party program, was
necessary for Lithuanian Communists to compete successfully in
local elections Feb. 24.
   However, a group of Lithuanian Communists who opposed the break
countered by forming their own leadership, and pledged continuing
loyalty to Moscow.
   The Central Committee invited both Brazauskas and the leaders of
the anti-separatist faction to Moscow to attend its meeting, Radio
Moscow said.

   The Protestant pastor who sparked
Romania's revolution by inspiring his congregation to defend their
faith is a quiet clergyman eager to resume his parish duties.
   The revolution that toppled President Nicolae Ceausescu began
Dec. 15 in the western city of Timisoara, when several hundred
people formed a human chain around the parish church of Laszlo
Toekes to prevent his arrest.
   That gesture grew into massive protests for freedom that
resulted in a bloodbath as thousands were gunned down by
Ceausescu's forces.
   The brutality of that massacre ignited the hatred and anger of
the country's 23 million people, who had suffered immense hardship
under Ceakusescu's repressive leadership.
   A chant often heard in the nationwide protests that finally
toppled Ceausescu Friday was ``Timisoara! Timisoara!''
   Toakes was named to the National Salvation Committee that was
formed to run the country, but the soft-spoken minister said he
planned to remain in his western village and build up a
congregation there.
   Born in 1952 in the Transylvanian city of Cluj, Toekes, a
Reformed Protestant, resisted stifling oppression to campaign for
religious and ethnic rights.
   Of ethnic Hungarian extraction and the son of a Protestant
minister, Toekes has been suspended from ministering to his
parishes and moved to other areas when the state deemed that his
influence among his congregation had grown too strong.
   In April, he was again suspended by his church superiors from
practicing in Timisoara, where he had been since 1986.
   Toekes refused to comply with the order. His home was repeatedly
attacked, and he received threatening notes.
   Toekes said in October that reforms in Eastern Europe had
``created favorable political circumstances'' for Romania and ``I
am among those who have had enough of silence and being silenced.''
   After masked men reportedly broke into his home in November and
threatened to kill him and his family, he moved into the church
with his pregnant wife and sent their son to stay with grandparents.
   On Saturday, Toekes told two Hungarian visitors that when the
unrest started in Timisoara, he was abducted and beaten by security
guards.
   He said he was interrogated for three days at the parish in the
Transylvanian village of Mineu. On Thursday, he was asked to sign a
document stating he had not been mistreated and the interrogating
officers asked him for forgiveness, the Hungarian MTI news agency
reported, quoting the Hungarians who visited him.
   Toekes' cause has been taken up in Hungary, where the plight of
the estimated 1.7 million ethnic Hungarian minority in Romania has
become a chief concern.
   Relations between the two countries have long been strained over
the territory of Transylvania, which had belonged to Hungary for
centuries before it was awarded to Romania in a 1920 treaty. Except
for a brief period during World War II, it remained with Romania.
   In 1988, Toekes joined 16 people in signing a petition opposing
a plan to move ethnic Hungarians from rural villages to government
housing complexes. Hungary and Western human rights activists said
the plan would destroy village culture and ethnic traditions.
   Since the revolutionaries took over the state TV and radio in
Bucharest Friday, ethnic Hungarians again have been allowed a voice.
   ``I believe that now for the first time in centuries there is a
historical opportunity for the Hungarian and Romanian peoples to
extend a hand to each other in friendship,'' Toekes was quoted by
his Hungarian visitors as saying.

   Many families reunited for the
first time in decades, carolers sang on Prague's old Charles
Bridge, and church bells rang across the nation Monday on
Czechoslovakia's first free Christmas in 41 years.
   ``I feel like this is a miracle,'' said Ivan Martin Jirous, who
was in prison last Christmas serving time for offering unauthorized
lectures on art and publishing an unofficial arts magazine.
   Jirous, 45, was released Nov. 25, about a week after the start
of the peaceful revolution that ousted the hard-line Communist
president, put the government in the hands of reformers and set the
nation on the road to electing a former dissident, Vaclav Havel, as
president before the new year.
   Imprisonment and exile have torn apart families for years.
   Jirous, who spent more than eight years in jail for his
``subversive'' activities, accompanied his two young daughters and
his wife to church Monday to give thanks for his release which he
called ``a present from the mercy of God.''
   On Christmas Eve 1978, Jirous was in Ostrov Nad Ohri prison,
notorious for its brutal guards as well as for the cruelty between
prisoners.
   ``But on Christmas something happened,'' Jirous recalled. ``We
placed a table in the middle of our cells and everybody broght
food, Chrismas sweets, fruit, everything good that they had.''
   ``Together we sat at the long table and there were no
differences, no accounting done on how much we brought or took. We
sang songs, not real Christmas carols because people who are in
Czechoslovak prisons do not know about Christmas, maternal warmth,
the closeness of families, morals or religion. But together we
sang.''
   Jirous said he considered saying a few words about the meaning
of Christmas, the birth of Christ and Christian charity.
   ``But I didn't. The way these people at the bottom of society
were unselfishly and joyously together was the real fulfillment of
Christmas _ without a theological facade. It was my most beautiful
Christmas,'' he said.
   On the 15th century Charles Bridge, groups of young carolers
sang haunting, traditional Christmas melodies in the days leading
up to Christmas. In previous years, police chased carolers from the
broad, cobbled King's Road.
   ``Rejoice, the Christ is born, rejoice!'' the carolers
exuberantly sang Sunday night while joy illuminated the faces of
many listeners.
   ``Everybody is so happy, so cheerful. It is euphoric with
everybody chatting about the future,'' said Dagmar Vogel, 22, home
for Christmas for the first time since she was 15 months old.
   Family conversations are filled with new possiblities: the
chance to study abroad, to write freely, to work without fear, to
be reunited with relatives overseas, she said.
   Miss Vogel's parents emigrated from Czechoslovakia to
Switzerland after the 1968 Soviet invasion crushed the reforms of
the ``Prague Spring.''
   For 21 years they kept in touch by letter, but Miss Vogel said
she did not know many of the family members she has met since
coming home this week.
   ``There are so many aunts, cousins I haven't met. But from the
first moment, I've felt like I belong. It's great to have a family.
It's wonderful to know somebody is there,'' she said, standing
beside the giant fir tree on Old Town Square with a sign reading,
``Freedom Under the Christmas Tree.''
   On Christmas Eve, Miss Vogel, her family and millions of other
Czechoslovaks watched Christmas Mass on an unprecedented live TV
broadcast. The Mass from Prague's 13th century Strahov Monastery
was said by Vaclav Maly, a former dissident priest who was banned
for 11 years for his human rights activities.
   Millions of other believers jammed into churches and Cathedrals
throughout the nation for midnight Mass. On Christmas Day,
90-year-old Cardinal Frantisek Tomasek said Mass at the gothic St.
Vitus Cathedral overlooking the city, delivering a sermon on the
responsiblity that freedom brings.
   In central Prague, on the site where pro-democracy rallies
turned the tide of Czechoslovak history last month, crowds of
students gathered to sing and share the holiday at the statue of
Bohemia's patron saint: good King Wenceslas.

<HEAD>At Last: A White Christmas in Buffalo ... But No Winterfest</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Organizers struggled for three years to
stage a Winterfest of snow sculpting and ice skating in spite of
balmy temperatures that sometimes seemed more suited to New Orleans
than New York.
   So this year they gave up and canceled the festival.
   Then the snow began.
   Buffalonians awoke Monday to their first white Christmas since
1985, in a December that figures to be one of the two coldest on
record. Nearly 3 feet of snow has fallen here so far this season,
and the National Weather Service says there's reason to believe it
will stay around for quite some time.
   Three feet so early in the season isn't unusual. Buffalo is on
the downwind side of Lake Erie and gets ``lake effect'' snow,
increased by moist air over the lake. But it's a far cry from the
kind of weather the city has seen in the last couple of few years.
   But despite the return of wintry weather, the Greater Buffalo
Chamber of Commerce is adamant: There will be no Winterfest this
year.
   The Chamber, which provided the services of 10 staff members and
raised $150,000 from businesses to put on the three-week festival,
won't quite say that the lack of snow was the reason it decided in
September to cancel the 1990 edition.
   But spokeswoman Karen Wodarczak said last week that the Chamber
did not really believe it was getting its money's worth from the
festival.
   City residents have not put up a great outcry to have Winterfest
revived, but the situation has prompted a few jokes.
   ``Someone just called me and said, `Can't you bring it back?
Then we won't have any snow,''' said Dottie Gallagher, spokeswoman
for Buffalo Place, an organization that oversees the downtown
shopping district and helped sponsor the previous festivals.
   ``A lot of people here felt it was kind of ironic,'' said Deputy
Mayor Samuel Iraci. ``All that stuff went into publicizing the fact
that here we are in Buffalo and it gets cold here, yeah, and we get
snow, but so what? And then there's no snow.''
   Last year's Winterfest was held in late January, a month in
which only 5\ inches of snow fell and temperatures reached 59
degrees.
   ``You'd walk around saying, `Is it really winter here?''' said
National Weather Service meteorologist George Skari.
   The year before, when only 56.4 inches fell during the entire
winter _ a little more than half the normal amount _ snow for the
snow-sculpting contest had to be trucked in from Canada and the
hills south of Buffalo.
   This year, however, is the coldest December on record since
1876. Although the long-range forecast is for near normal
temperatures the rest of the winter, Skari said there is reason to
be skeptical about that.
   ``When you have a cold November and December, especially
December like we've had, there's a higher percentage of the next
month being cold,'' he said. ``There's no scientific fact to that _
it's just playing with statistics _ but some of the harshest
winters have followed a cold December.''
   As for snowfall, Skari said, ``Watch this year be just about
banner. We'll have all kinds of snow and there won't be a
Winterfest.''
   A few parts of the show will still go on, including the
snow-sculpting contest sponsored by Buffalo Place in early February.
   Iraci said Buffalo's first First Night celebration, an arts and
music festival on New Year's Eve, also will help pick up the slack.
He said the city will help revive Winterfest if other private
groups want to assume the Chamber's role.
   Wodarczak found a silver lining in the troubles of Winterfest.
   ``One of our goals of Winterfest was to improve Buffalo's
national image,'' Wodarczak said. ``We did get some national
publicity over the fact that there was no snow, so we considered it
a positive.''

<HEAD>West and East Berliners Celebrate Christmas Together</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leonard Bernstein transformed a Christmas
performance of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony into an appeal for
brotherhood as West and East Berliners mingled freely in the
divided city for the first Christmas in 28 years.
   ``I am experiencing a historical moment _ incomparable with
others in my long, long life,'' the American conductor said during
the nationally televised performance Monday.
   Bernstein conducted an international group of musicians in the
Schauspielhaus, capping three days of performances that celebrated
the demise of the Berlin Wall and the struggle for freedom
throughout Eastern Europe.
   The Ninth Symphony was inspired by German writer Friedrich
Schiller's 18th century poem ``Ode to Joy.'' In the concert,
Bernstein substituted the word ``freedom'' for ``joy'' in the
chorus to reflect his personal message.
   The 71-year-old musician conducted the same symphony at the
Philharmonic in West Berlin in a performance timed to end at
midnight Saturday, when West Germans were allowed to travel without
visas into East Germany for the first time.
   More than 1,000 people poured into the Schauspielhaus for the
10:30 a.m. Christmas concert, while hundreds more packed the square
in front of the concert hall to watch the performance on a giant
television monitor.
   The concert was also broadcast live in more than 20 countries by
satellite.
   Bernstein united an international group of musicians from East
and West Germany as well as the United States, Britain, France and
the Soviet Union _ the four victorious World War II allies still
technically responsible for governing Berlin.
   The East German government presented Bernstein the ``Star of
People's Friendship.''
   In the city, hundreds of thousands of Berliners passed freely
through the wall via crossings created in the concrete barrier
after East Germany threw open its borders six weeks ago.
   West Berliners had to wait up to three hours to cross into East
Berlin by car and there were long lines at two new crossings at the
Brandenburg Gate.
   One West Berliner riding a bicycle and dressed up as Santa Claus
failed to persuade border guards to let him through ahead of the
rest of the crowd.
   Berliners packed cafes and restaurants on Unter den Linden, East
Berlin's most elegant boulevard, while in West Berlin, street
vendors did a brisk business selling sausages on a cold, sunny day.
   East German border police reported that 274,500 East Germans had
crossed into West Germany, while 268,000 West Germans went into
East Germany.
   It was busier in Berlin, however, where 220,000 East Berliners
went West and 257,000 West Berliners went East.

   An anonymous benefactor is enriching the
lives of veteran Whitworth College faculty members, providing free
vacations anywhere in the world, exotic food and other gifts.
   ``This person has been a Santa Claus many times over,'' said Ed
Olson, a geology professor who has been given two weeks in New
Zealand with the use of a motor home next month.
   For the past year and a half, 17 faculty members who have been
at the small, private liberal arts college at least 20 years have
benefited from the largesse of a man they know only as ``M.M.'' for
mystery man.
   Professors typically are contacted by Laurel Livingston of the
Bremerton AAA Travel Agency, who offers them and their spouses
two-week vacations, including travel, lodging and sometimes $1,000
to cover miscellaneous expenses.
   After the trips, they get presents like Thanksgiving hams,
imported coffee, exotic foods from distant cities, cameras,
binoculars, calendars and art, many accompanied by notes signed
only ``M.M.''
   One professor got a coffee grinder and, a few months later, a
second coffee grinder with a note explaining the first model was
unreliable.
   The travel agent won't say who the donor is, but faculty members
believe he graduated from Whitworth sometime in the 1960s, went
into business in the Puget Sound area and lives in Seattle.
   ``We honestly can't identify who it is,'' said Howard Gage, a
math professor who took a gift trip to England with his wife last
summer. ``That's part of the fun.''
   ``This is too good to be real,'' said art professor Spike
Grosvenor, who got a trip to England last summer. ``It's the sort
of thing that only happens on Christmas TV specials or in the
Reader's Digest.''
   Recipients since the program began in June 1988 are 14 men and
three women 50 to 87 years old. Six are retired. Two other retired
faculty members were were unable to accept trips for health reasons.
   ``I've never heard of any other faculty group getting this sort
of reward,'' said psychology professor Patricia MacDonald, who has
taught at Whitworth for 35 years and received a trip to Hawaii last
summer. ``It makes us feel special.''
   Chemistry professor Bob Bocksch, the first recipient of a gift
vacation, initially refused a second trip.
   ``I think he felt our first trip didn't cost enough, being just
two weeks in Hawaii, so he suggested we take a second one,'' he
said.
   Bocksch wrote a note through the travel agent suggesting a
donation to a chemistry equipment fund instead.
   The donor sent a $5,000 check to the school, then insisted that
Bocksch take a second vacation. He relented and took a 10-day
Alaskan cruise.
   The first three trips were given to faculty members who were
told that the gifts were in gratitude to teachers who helped the
mystery man when he was a student.
   Later gifts went to ``people he wanted to honor for their
contributions to Whitworth,'' Livingston said.
   Livingston described the donor as a ``very generous, very caring
person'' who travels frequently and likes people. She said he would
not give his reasons for the gifts or say how much he had spent.
   Grosvenor is one of three recipients who have talked with him by
phone.
   ``Certain clues make me think he was a classmate of Howard
(Gage)'s and mine,'' Grosvenor said. ``He knew that I spent one
summer working as a groundskeeper at the college.
   ``Whoever he is, he does his homework. He knew all about my
field of study and that I had never been to Europe. It's amazing
how much he knew.''
   Grosvenor said the donor suggested a trip this fall to England
to study stained glass, the professor's special interest. He said
the resulting trip was ``the most wonderful, perfect vacation I
could have had.''
   Music professor Thomas Tavener was just offered a trip but has
yet to choose a destination. ``It is exciting,'' he said. ``I guess
there are benefits for staying in one place for 31 years.''

<HEAD>East Europe, Third World Debt Seen Rising</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Debts of East European and Third World
countries are due to rise next year despite the plan of Treasury
Secretary Nicholas F. Brady to ease some of the heaviest burdens on
debtor countries.
   ``When you have a vibrant, growing economy -- like Indonesia,
for example -- debt can be a good thing if it doesn't grow too
fast,'' said John M. Underwood of the World Bank.
   ``It's a sign that foreigners have confidence that it's a good
place to put their money.''
   Indonesia's debt rose from $43 billion in 1986 to $52 billion
last year, according to figures the bank issued this week.
Indonesia had to pay out nearly $8.5 billion in principal and
interest to its creditors in 1988.
   Third World leaders complain that such outflows leave them litle
to build the schools and buy the equipment to create jobs for their
growing populations. The bank calculated the total outflow at more
than $51 billion this year.
   Until 1983, new loans to developing countries brought them more
money than they had to pay out on the old ones.
   Despite the cost, Third World governments still seek more loans,
if only to help pay the interest on the old loans.
   Underwood is top economist in the International Economics
Department of the World Bank, the largest source of aid to Third
World countries. The aid is also in the form of loans, over $21
billion in the year that ended June 30.
   The bank plans to provide as much as $1.35 billion to Poland,
which got nothing last year but already owes more than $42 billion.
Its new non-Communist leadership is hoping to borrow an additional
$4 billion or more in the coming year.
   Brady's strategy seeks to ease the burden for 39 debtor
countries, by combining debt and interest reduction with new loans
from banks. So far, plans have been developed for three countries:
Mexico, the Philippines and Costa Rica.
   The World Bank estimated that his strategy could save as much as
$6 billion a year for 19 ``severely indebted middle-income
countries'' like Argentina and the Philippines, which owe much of
their debt to private banks. He made his proposal last March,
before the big changes in eastern European countries which now have
better prospects for getting the new loans they want.
   For the poorest countries, governments are the main creditors
rather than banks. During the 1980s, 10 creditor governments have
forgiven $2.3 billion owed to them. The United States, which was
not among the 10, has promised to forgive another billion. New aid
to these countries, most of them in Africa, is now largely in the
form of grants.
   Two officials of Resources for the Future, a private study group
in Washington, said that the United States has an interest in
easing the debt burden: the heaviest debtors are among the biggest
buyers of U.S. goods. The less they have to pay out to banks, the
more they have left over to buy the products of U.S. farms and
industries, they pointed out.
   ``The net result of easing debt burdens would be more robust
economies that would support more stable political systems and
create stronger markets for U.S. exports,'' wrote Elaine M. Koerner
and George E. Rossmiller in the fall issue of ``Resource for the
Future,'' the organization's quarterly publication.
   The World Bank predicted that the debt of 111 countries will
rise to $1.189 trillion in 1990 from $1.165 trillion this year.
Underwood said that the Institute of International Finance, which
collects figures for major private banks, adds another $188 billion
for 10 countries, including the Soviet Union, that the bank does
not count. The Central Intelligence Agency estimated that the
Soviets owed $42.3 billion to western banks last year.
   That would bring the current total to $1.353 trillion. The
figure could be raised in 1990 by new lending to help East European
governments as they switch to something more like the market
economies of the west.

   Pope John Paul II offered a special prayer
for the people of Romania and expressed hope in his traditional
Christmas message that the spirit of the holiday will reach across
his native Eastern Europe.
   In his gold robes and miter, the pope emerged at noon on his
balcony overlooking sun-dappled St. Peter's Square, where tens of
thousands of faithful and tourists listened to the annual ``Urbi et
Orbi,'' Latin for ``to the city and to the world.''
   ``May the light that came into the world on this blessed day
shine in your hearts and in your homes always,'' the pope said in
English, his head bowed.
   ``The world longs for peace,'' John Paul declared, then listed
conflicts worldwide: Lebanon, the Holy Land, Central America,
Africa and Asia.
   After his words about Eastern Europe and especially Romania, the
pope paused for a few seconds and lifted his head.
   ``May this old Europe of ours also receive you, O Word
Incarnate!'' he said. ``Deep within her she carries the imprint of
your gospel from which she has derived her culture, her art, her
concept of the inviolable dignity of man.''
   ``May this Europe open her doors and her heart to understand and
receive the anxieties, the fears and the problems of the nations
which seek her help,'' the pope said.
   ``May she respond with the strength and the generosity of her
Christian roots to this very special moment of history ... which
the world is now experiencing as if awakened from a nightmare and
opened up to a better hope.''
   Although he did not name the countries, it was clear the pope
was referring to Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Bulgaria, Hungary,
and his native Poland, where Communist regimes this year have seen
their once-absolute power shaken and diluted.
   In Romania, a popular revolt ousted the hard-line Communist
leader, Nicolae Ceausescu, but thousands of people are believed to
have died in fighting between pro- and anti-Ceausescu forces.
   ``In particular, bless at this hour, O Lord, the noble land of
Romania, which is celebrating this Christmas in fear and trembling
with sorrow for the many human lives tragically lost and in the joy
of having taken once more the path of freedom,'' the pope said.
   He paused to bring his folded hands to his face as if deep in
thought, then looked up after a few seconds and finished his speech.
   In keeping with his custom, the pope ended his public appearance
by saying ``Merry Christmas'' in 53 languages, beginning in Italian
and ending in Latin.
   In his message, the pope also prayed for guidance for
negotiators involved in arms control agreements and denounced the
``self-interest'' or ``lack of concern'' that aggravates pollution.
   He also cited the plight of ethnic and religious minorities and
refugees without citing specific nations or groups.
   The pope did not mention Panama, where ousted dictator Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega has sought refuge at the Vatican Embassy to
evade U.S. troops sent in to capture him. More than 200 people have
died as a result of the fighting.

   Jailed black leader Nelson
Mandela, whose 28th Christmas behind bars will almost certainly be
his last in custody, opened presents and had a quiet dinner with
his family Monday.
   Mandela's wife, Winnie, their daughter, Zindzi, and her three
young children spent most of the day at the comfortable
three-bedroom home where Mandela is held at the Victor Verster
Prison outside Cape Town.
   ``He would have loved to spend Christmas at home with us,'' said
Mrs. Mandela, who had tears in her eyes when she spoke to reporters
afterward.
   ``He regrets to advise that he has no new information whatsoever
about his release,'' she added. ``As far as he knows, there have
been no further developments that point to his immediate release.''
   The family brought a cake with icing in the green, gold and
black colors of the African National Congress, the outlawed
guerrilla movement Mandela heads.
   The family gave Mandela shirts from a Johannesburg tailor who
made suits for seven of Mandela's ANC colleagues released from
prison in October.
   Mrs. Mandela said telling the grandchildren, ages 9, 6 and less
than 1 year, that their grandfather could not leave with them was
``particularly painful.''
   The family planned another visit Tuesday before returning to
their home in Soweto, the huge black township outside Johannesburg.
   Mandela, 71, is the country's best-known black leader and the
world's most famous prisoner. He has been jailed since 1962 and is
serving a life sentence for plotting an anti-government sabotage
campaign.
   His release is widely expected within weeks, and there was
speculation he might be freed on or around Christmas. The
government quashed those rumors Friday by saying Mandela would not
be freed this year.
   Mandela has had a steady stream of visitors in recent months,
ranging from anti-apartheid activists to government leaders. He met
Dec. 13 with President F.W. de Klerk at the presidential offices.
   The freeing of the seven ANC leaders was seen a trial run for
Mandela's release. The seven, who have been active in promoting the
ANC since their release, were to have Christmas dinner at the
Johannesburg home of Helen Joseph, an 84-year-old white
anti-apartheid activist.
   Ms. Joseph, one of Mandela's co-defendants at a 1956-61 treason
trial, visited Mandela on Thursday. It was their first meeting in
28 years.
   The Mandelas have another daughter, Zeni, who is married and
studying in the United States.
   Mandela also has a son and a daughter from his first marriage,
which ended in divorce. Another son from that marriage was killed
in a traffic accident.

<HEAD>Texan's Off-The-Record Conversation Sparks Furor In International
Agriculture</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   When Texan John Baize, a vice president for
the American Soybean Association, criticized the United States'
controversial sugar program in an interview with a graduate
student, he thought he was speaking off the record.
   But after copies of an alleged transcript were leaked on Capitol
Hill, Baize found himself out of a job and at the center of an
international intrigue that has touched Minnesota's agriculture
commissioner _ and apparently angered Agriculture Secretary Clayton
Yeutter.
   At a yearend news conference Thursday, Yeutter appealed for
broad support of liberalized trade policies being advocated in
Geneva in ongoing negotiations under the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade.
   Yeutter said he believes there is broad support for the Bush
administration's proposals but noted that ``we have seen some
evidence of undercutting here and there by particular groups,''
which he did not identify.
   Kelly Shipp, his press secretary, later told The Associated
Press that Yeutter referred mostly to Minnesota Agriculture
Commissioner Jim Nichols, a Democrat, and not specifically to any
farm organizations.
   Pressed about Nichols, she said only that Nichols was ``the one
that's on his mind.''
   In an interview Friday, Nichols said the ``Baize incident'' and
Yeutter's complaints are linked, and he is not Yeutter's only
opponent on GATT issues.
   Nichols' farm policy analyst, Mark Ritchie, is responsible for
circulating copies of Baize's interview with the European student
to Minnesota sugar beet growers _ who have a stake in protecting
the government's strict quotas on sugar imports. Those comments
ended up on Capitol Hill and sparked the furor that led to Baize's
resignation on Nov. 10 from the job he had held since 1979.
   As Baize's comments were circulated anonymously on Capitol Hill,
Ritchie also was circulating GATT documents in Congress from the
U.S. Trade Representative, which Nichols contended pitted soybean
farmers against sugar producers.
   Baize believes the student who taped the August interview _
which he thought was to be an academic discussion to help her write
a thesis on agricultural trade _ turned the tape over to an
organization in France.
   Baize said the French group apparently gave the interview to
Ritchie, who acknowledges providing summaries to Minnesota sugar
beet growers.
   Those growers contacted others in the sugar industry and the
transcript was suddenly being ``faxed all over the Hill,'' Baize
said.
   Marlyn Jorgensen, president of the American Soybean Association,
moved to assure Rep. Kika de la Garza, D-Texas, chairman of the
House Agriculture Committee, that the ASA does not oppose the U.S.
sugar program.
   In a letter dated Oct. 25, Jorgensen told de la Garza, whose
district includes Texas' sugar cane growers, that Baize's comments
had been taken out of context and ``it appears that ASA has been
used for purposes that many of us do not know.''
   `I cant' believe John lost his job over this deal,'' Nichols
said. ``John's said it for years.''
   Said Baize: ``I had a frank, academic discussion and I
understood and was told it was to be off the record. I resent
anyone using an off-the-record interview, taking things out of
context, with a malicious intent to injure me. But so be it.''
   Baize, a Gatesville, Texas, native, said his sources say the
student was told before she left Europe to specifically interview
him, and that when she returned, the group asked for only one
interview tape out of 25 or 30 _ his.
   Baize said he may have been singled out because he was the
architect of the Soybean Association's charge that the European
Community's oilseed subsidies were illegal under international
trading rules.
   A dispute settlement panel of GATT ruled ``the U.S. position was
100 percent correct,'' Baize said.
   ``The fact that we filed the case and were very aggressive in
persuing it here and in Europe, angered a lot of people in the
oilseed industry in France and Europe,'' Baize said.
   Ritchie, the farm policy analyst, claims Baize knew the
interview was on the record and that the student's report would be
published in Europe.
   Ritchie, who is on a technical review committee for the
student's thesis, said Baize's comments put his state's $370
million sugar beet industry at risk by giving Europe more
ammunition to fight the U.S. sugar program in GATT.
   Baize, meanwhile, said he has ``other irons in the fire,'' and
is not bitter at his former employer.
   ``I guess I've always been a sucker for these students who come
in and want to learn something,'' Baize said.

   Charles Hunter surprised his teacher and
classmates with the results of a one-in-a-million task. But he had
a little high-tech help from a computer.
   Steve Randak, who teaches a biology class for gifted students at
Lafayette Jefferson High School, told his students he would give an
A for the semester to anyone who wrote out every number from one to
1 million.
   Hunter took up the challenge. Last week he toted in all 1
million numbers printed on about 2,400 pages of paper that weighed
about 50 pounds.
   He didn't qualify for the A because he generated the numbers on
his home computer, but his regular work is earning him an A in the
course anyway.
   ``He's the first one who ever took off and did something
creative with this, and this is typical of Charles,'' said Randak.
   Hunter said he first set out to write each number by hand, but
he lost interest at about 5,000.
   His interest was renewed when he thought of printing the numbers
by computer. He ran the program at least seven hours a day for two
weeks. After 2{ boxes of computer paper and three ink cartridges,
he reached the magic number.
   ``I just thought it would be really neat to show someone could
do it and to prove how large a million is,'' said Hunter.
   Doing the task longhand, even at the brisk pace of one number a
second, would take more than 11{ days straight, working night and
day.

<TEXT>
   In a musty basement storage room of the
Muskegon County Museum, surrounded by mannequin parts and antique
canoes in disrepair, Wilfrid Berg is picking up where he left off
55 years ago.
   The 81-year-old artist is finally getting the chance to paint
the second of two murals commissioned from him in 1934 by the Works
Progress Administration for the children's reading room at the city
library.
   ``I had the sketches done. I was all ready to do it back then,
and then the money ran out,'' said Berg, a slight man with white
hair and sparkling blue eyes.
   The WPA, a New Deal program of President Franklin D. Roosevelt
to help economic recovery from the Depression, notified the Lake
Michigan city it was eligible for mural funds. At the time, artists
were being put to work on murals in public buildings nationwide.
   Berg, then 26, was contacted, and ``the next morning I was
looking for a spot,'' he recalled.
   The children's reading room of the Hackley Public Library was
chosen.
   The WPA commissioned two murals for opposite walls of the room
above oak bookcases. Berg finished one, now mounted on the west
wall. Called ``The World at Your Door,'' it features people of
different nations in native dress.
   He recalls being paid either $100 or $200 for that project
before funds ran out. He worked five more weeks on his own time to
complete it.
   The second mural _ featuring characters from classic children's
literature _ was canceled.
   ``I put the sketches away and forgot about it. But really, it's
something I always wanted to do,'' Berg says as he glances at his
sketches of intermingling characters such as Pinocchio, Robinson
Crusoe, Peter Rabbit, Cinderella and Huck Finn.
   Library officials had been trying to find the sketches for the
29-foot mural for two or three years before they surfaced at the
adjacent Muskegon Museum of Art a couple of years ago, said Dale
Pretzer, the library's director.
   ``It was like looking for a lost manuscript that's a sequel to a
great book,'' Pretzer said.
   Once the sketches were found, there still was the challenge of
finding funds for Berg to take up his task again.
   Along came Muskegon residents Shirley and Daniel Rapoport,
long-time supporters of the library, which is celebrating its
centennial in 1990.
   ``My children loved that library so much as they were growing
up,'' said Mrs. Rapoport, a retired schoolteacher. ``When we found
out about the other mural and that the artist was still alive, I
thought it would be such a lovely gift for the centennial
celebration.''
   She won't say how much she is contributing for the work, calling
it a modest amount.
   Meanwhile, Berg, dressed in blue jeans and a denim shirt, is
working in his makeshift studio seven hours a day, and is expecting
to finish the project in about four months.
   ``I don't move quite as fast as I used to,'' he said with a
smile.
   He is keeping the mural's original design and theme, ``Idle
Hours with Good Books is Time Well Spent.'' The dedication of the
mural is scheduled for July.
   The project has not overwhelmed Berg; he's never retired. The
never-married Muskegon native (``I could never afford a wife,'' he
says) recently completed a mural for the county museum chronicling
the history of the city, and paints Lake Michigan landscapes.
   He recalls taking odd jobs _ truck driving, house painting,
framing _ to support his love of creating art. Although he's been
painting most of his life, recognition has come only in the last
few years.
   In 1988, the art museum featured his varied work _ including
watercolors, oils, lithographs _ even cartoons _ in a one-man show,
``Wilfrid Berg: A Muskegon Treasure.''
   ``Muskegon's not exactly a hotbed of art ... so we're very lucky
to have him,'' said volunteer curator Robert Youngman, who found
the sketches. ``I have a great respect for his talent and I'm
thrilled he's finally getting the recognition he deserves.''

<HEAD>Ceausescu Created Cult of Personality During 24-Year Rule</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Romania, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nicolae Ceausescu, a peasant's son who
rose to rule Romania with an iron grip for 24 years, created a cult
of personality unmatched in Eastern Europe since the days of Soviet
dictator Josef Stalin.
   His wife, Elena, became his virtual second-in-command until
their sudden descent from power.
   The two were reported captured Saturday trying to flee a popular
revolution sparked by a massacre of thousands of people. On Monday,
Bucharest Radio said they were executed after a secret trial found
them guilty of ``grave crimes'' _ among them, the deaths of 60,000
protesters this month and spiriting $1 billion in public funds out
of the country.
   Before he was shouted down at a Bucharest rally he orchestrated
Thursday _ his last public appearance _ the 71-year-old Communist
leader's hold on power was so firm that he could carry out a
foreign policy independent of the Soviet Union and the other East
bloc countries.
   Just one month ago, he was overwhelmingly reaffirmed as supreme
leader by a fiercely obedient Communist Party conference. He was
the last hard-line Communist leader in the Soviet bloc after
democratic reforms swept through Poland, Hungary, East Germany,
Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria this year.
   His party hailed himself as the ``Genius of the Carpathians''
and the ``Conducator.'' His severity earned him the nickname
``Draculescu,'' for Bram Stoker's bloodthirsty count of
Transylvania.
   He imposed austerity on the people yet was building a
presidential palace as a monument to himself. He had lavish
mountain and sea retreats.
   Born Jan. 26, 1918, in Scornicesti, Ceausescu was the third son
of a large peasant family. An elementary school dropout, he was
apprenticed as a shoemaker, took a job in a factory and joined the
illegal Communist Party youth organization at age 15. He became a
party member three years later, in 1936.
   Before and during World War II, his Communist activities landed
him in jail several times. He became a protege of Communist leader
Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, rose quickly in the party, and succeeded
his mentor after his death in 1965.
   He turned the party into a personal instrument, gradually
pushing aside all leaders who opposed his policies and installing
loyalists on the ruling 23-member Politburo, including Elena
Ceausescu, who rose to head the country's scientific community
despite doubts about her background and education.
   Nicu, their youngest son, was regional party chief in central
Romania. Valentin, an adopted son, Zoia-Elena, their daughter, and
Ceausescu brothers held prestigious posts, as did several in-laws.
   Western analysts and knowledgeable Romanians estimate that about
40 members of his family held top jobs in the party and state
hierarchy.
   When he was elected president in March 1974, an official picture
showed him holding a silver scepter as the symbol of authority.
   The personality cult he encouraged took on the trappings of
worship and pervaded practically all aspects of public life. His
portrait lined the streets in Bucharest and other Romanian cities
and bookstores were full of works attributed to him.
   The United States and other Western powers originally cultivated
Ceausescu's relatively independent foreign policy stand within the
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact. Two U.S. presidents visited Bucharest,
Richard Nixon in 1969 and Gerald Ford in 1975, and President Jimmy
Carter threw a state dinner for him in Washington in 1978. Queen
Elizabeth II awared him an honorary knighthood.
   Ceausescu maintained diplomatic relations with Israel even after
other Soviet bloc countries broke them during the 1967 Middle East
War.
   In keeping with his maverick image, he denounced the Soviet-led
invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, refused to participate and
refused to allow any foreign troops in Romania.
   Romania was the only East bloc country to send athletes to the
1984 Olympics in Los Angeles, breaking the Soviet-led boycott.
   In later years, he grew more dogmatic, rejecting the need for
reform adopted by other bloc allies, such as Poland and Hungary.
Earlier this year, he urged his Warsaw Pact allies to invade Poland
to prevent a Solidarity-led government from taking power.
   Romania became increasingly isolated in both East and West,
particularly after 30,000 Romanians, mostly ethnic Hungarians, fled
to Hungary last year.
   The Hungarians complained about alleged discrimination and
denial of their ethnic and cultural rights, but they also sought
refuge in Hungary to escape chronic hardships under Ceausescu.
   Ceausescu viewed the changes in Eastern Europe with alarm and
accused other Warsaw Pact countries of abandoning orthodox
Communism.
   ``The triumph of the revolution requires unity, severe
discipline and a spirit of sacrifice. A firm organization is needed
as well as a tested political leader who knows how to unite and
lead the masses,'' he told a mass meeting in Bucharest earlier this
year.
   He invested billions of dollars in a crash industrialization
program and rigidly followed a policy of domestic austerity to pay
off Romania's $11 billion foreign debt.
   Romania, once known as the breadbasket of the Balkans, became
one of Europe's poorest countries. The longer the food lines and
the more vocal the people's complaints, the more harshly the regime
cracked down on critics.
   Despair spread among the nation's 23 million people as hardships
became more severe throughout the 1980s, and in the end not even
the secret policy or the army could keep them down.
   On Dec. 17, his security forces opened fire on thousands of
demonstrators in Timisoara who demanded freedom and a better life,
beginning the chain of events that brought him down.
   He looked surprised and dismayed as his orchestrated rally
Thursday turned into an anti-Ceausescu rally. Protesters on Friday
burned his portraits and hurled his books into the street.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   She sits at the negotiating table with Mikhail
Gorbachev, advises James A. Baker III, travels on Air Force One
with George Bush and spars daily with the nation's foreign policy
pundits.
   But Margaret DeBardeleben Tutwiler, a Birmingham, Ala.,
debutante with a thick Southern drawl, says it's ``laughable,
ludicrous, embarrassing'' to suggest she's one of the most powerful
women in Washington.
   Others disagree.
   The 39-year-old Tutwiler, a longtime aide to Secretary of State
Baker, wears the twin hats of assistant secretary of state for
public affairs and the State Department's spokeswoman, one of the
most visible jobs in government.
   As spokeswoman _ she's the first woman to be assistant secretary
of state for public affairs _ the workaholic, unmarried Tutwiler
appears almost every day on the klieg-lighted podium to explain
U.S. foreign policy to reporters and television audiences around
the world.
   It's a long way from Finch College, Tricia Nixon's alma mater
and the New York school Tutwiler attended before she transferred to
the University of Alabama.
   While Tutwiler's face has become familiar in the last year, most
Washington insiders say her influence stems more from her access to
Baker than her sessions at the podium or her knowledge of
diplomatic nuance.
   ``Her greatest strength has always been her close relationship
with Jim Baker and her knowledge of what he is doing and
thinking,'' said John McWethy, ABC's State Department correspondent.
   Theodore Wilkinson, president of the American Foreign Service
Association, agreed.
   A career foreign service officer undoubtedly would have a
stronger grasp of policy, but probably wouldn't have Tutwiler's
``great asset'' _ her access to Baker, he said.
   So if access is power _ and in Washington it is _ Tutwiler has
it.
   Amidst the oriental rugs and antiques on the department's
exclusive seventh floor suite, Tutwiler's well-appointed cubbyhole
has a door leading to Baker's office.
   And friends and colleagues say she's not bashful about opening
it to tell her boss of nearly a decade what she thinks on subjects
ranging from sanctions against China to briefing times during the
storm-tossed U.S.-Soviet summit on Malta.
   Behind the Southern belle is a steel magnolia, say those who
have seen Tutwiler cross wires with the likes of Gennady Gerasimov,
Gorbachev's spokesman.
   ``She has good judgment and instincts about the public's
reaction,'' says V. Kim Hoggard, Tutwiler's deputy. ``She judges by
her own reaction ... that's why Baker values her advice.''
   ``Levelheaded'' is the way her childhood friend, Virginia
Scruggs, describes Tutwiler.
   Tutwiler, although reluctant to engage in self-promotion, says
her assets are her loyalty and her forthright manner.
   ``I know he thinks I'm loyal,'' she said of Baker. And in
sessions with the secretary and others in his inner circle, she
said she speaks her mind. ``I'm not playing a game with him, in
other words. Many times I say what I believe.''
   Tutwiler's relationship with Baker was forged in the 1980s when
she was his assistant at the White House, at the Treasury
Department and on the 1988 Bush presidential campaign.
   She came to the White House after working in Bush's unsuccessful
1980 presidential primary campaign. Ronald Reagan captured the GOP
nomination, but named Bush as his running mate. She counts both
Baker and Bush as her friends.
   Although Tutwiler served as an assistant secretary at the
Treasury Department, she preferred to remain behind the scenes,
rarely briefing reporters or talking in public.
   That changed at the State Department.
   ``It was very terrifying and frightening to me to grapple with,
`Can I do this job that the president and secretary of state would
like for me to try to do?,''' she said.
   Besides appearing on television, Tutwiler had to grapple with
the subject matter.
   ``I'll be honest with you. It was absolutely overwhelming,'' she
said. ``To learn all at once the United States' foreign policy in
Cambodia, in Afghanistan, in Nicaragua, in El Salvador, in arms
control ... to learn all our policies about Germany ... to learn
the world, at once.''
   In the daily press briefings, the stylish Tutwiler _ with her
fashionable clothes and streaked blonde hair _ usually reads,
verbatim, statements prepared by diplomats on issues of the day. At
times, she seems stilted, fearful of making a mistake.
   McWethy and others say she's getting better. ``Without question,
her performance at the briefings has improved and she has a better
grasp of the subject matter,'' he said.
   Tutwiler's glamorous career hasn't come without some sacrifice,
mainly her personal life.
   ``I really haven't had one,'' Tutwiler said. ``I always keep
putting my other interests on the back burner and I'm definitely
doing that here.''
   An organized perfectionist, Tutwiler keeps a grueling schedule.
She rises at 5:30 a.m., is at her desk at 6:30 a.m., and rarely
returns to her home in fashionable northwest Washington before 9
p.m. Breakfast and dinner often consist of cheese and crackers at
her desk.
   Then there is the seemingly non-stop travel _ over 126,000 miles
since February to places as far away as Australia.
   In December, she traveled to Malta for the summit, and then
accompanied Baker to London, Berlin and Brussels. Later that month,
she went to St. Martin with Baker. At Christmas, she's going skiing
with her brother and sister and their families.
   But Tutwiler's philosophy is that ``life is a tradeoff, a
compromise,'' and she doesn't know many people who would walk away
from the chance to sit at the table with Gorbachev or see the
Kremlin's inner sanctum.
   ``Money can't buy that,'' she said.
   Tutwiler said there will always be time for her other interests,
of which she has many.
   ``I grow roses, I love entertaining. I love reading. I love
biographies of women. I love histories of the South. I enjoy
cooking. I enjoy flower arranging. I enjoy the study of carpets. I
enjoy personal travel.''
   Despite her consuming job, Scruggs, who has known Tutwiler since
the first grade in Birmingham, said Tutwiler is a family-oriented
person, and a ``doting aunt'' who loves spending time with her
nieces and nephews.
   When Scruggs, the mother of two children, gets together with
Tutwiler, the two talk about how they envy parts of the other's
life.
   But Tutwiler seems happy with the choices she's made.
   ``I'm a very lucky, lucky girl,'' she says.

<HEAD>Coast Guard To Test New Tanker Tracking System</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Coast Guard says it will test
a new system for keeping track of oil tankers in Alaska's Prince
William Sound, site of the nation's worst oil spill.
   The system will utilize satellite signals and long-range aids to
navigation rather than radar, said Mike Sollosi, chief of vessel
traffic services in the Coast Guard's Washington, D.C.,
headquarters.
   ``It is a black box on a ship which takes an accurate position
(of the vessel) and transmits the information to a vessel tracking
system'' such as the vessel traffic center in Valdez, Sollosi said
in a statement issued last week.
   He said a satellite is a tool for tracking ``because it is not
affected by mountains, which is a problem in Alaska.''
   Tanker traffic in Prince William Sound has been monitored by
radar. But when the Exxon Valdez ran aground March 24, the Coast
Guard said the vessel was beyond the area normally scanned by the
Valdez radar. The ruptured tanker spilled 11 million gallons of
crude oil into the sound.
   After the skipper reported the tanker was aground, the Coast
Guard was able to find it on radar, but operators said reliability
of the radar was limited by weather.
   Sollosi said the new system will be evaluated for one year in
the sound and 22 other ports and waterways around the country. He
said vessel owners will be responsible for the cost of installing

   Elena Ceausescu, the textile worker
who rose to virtual second-in-command, was praised by her husband's
regime as ``the best mother of Romania,'' but insiders say she
derided her people as ``worms.''
   During the years of her husband's draconian rule, she also
developed a taste for furs and jewelry, and was honored for
scientific expertise she did not possess. She had bugs planted to
spy on her children.
   Official biographies shaved two years off her age, to make her
one year younger than her husband, Nicolae Ceausescu. Mrs.
Ceausescu actually was 72, a year older than the deposed dictator.
   Bucharest Radio said she and her husband were put on trial
secretly and executed Monday for genocide and other crimes against
the Romanian people.
   Mrs. Ceaucescu was born in Petresti, a village in southern
Romania, in 1917. She married her husband when both were teen-age
revolutionaries and joined the Communist Party in 1937 in Bucharest
where she worked in a textile factory.
   After Ceausescu's takeover in 1965, she rapidly rose in the
party hierarchy. She was named a member of the party executive
committee in 1973, and also was a member of the Politburo and first
vice premier.
   She once was elected ``queen'' of a workers' parade on May 1,
1939, and she lived like one in the last two decades.
   Elena and Nicolae Ceausescu acted much like a royal family,
traveling abroad, conducting well-staged visits to farms and
factories, and making a regal promenade at state receptions.
   Romanian TV on Sunday showed footage from one of the Ceausescus'
residences, displaying some of her jewelry and Western currency
allegedly prepared in a bag for escape.
   One of her many expensive fur coats was found at the Communist
Party headquarters Friday and paraded in front of photographers
after she and her husband fled the capital by helicopter.
   Mrs. Ceausescu was said to be a trained chemist and was praised
as a ``scientist of world fame.'' Her works filled Romanian
bookstores and were translated into foreign languages. But they
were believed to be ghost-written by other scientists.
   As chairman of the national council for science and education,
Mrs. Ceausescu was in charge of all curricula, from elementary
schools to higher education.
   Her celebrated competence in science was less than genuine.
During her time as director of the Central Institute of Chemical
Research, she took the floor at several national conferences and
meetings but spoke on general matters.
   Whenever a specific scientific theme arose, she deferred to a
``Comrade Engineer'' who then had to explain the details.
   Gen. Ion Pacepa, chief of Romanian intelligence operations
abroad until 1978 when he defected to the United States, said in a
book published last year that his duties included collecting
classified technological information to be used in the books by
Mrs. Ceausescu.
   Pacepa said he was also ordered to ensure Mrs. Ceausescu could
shop for jewelry whenever she wanted.
   He said he reported to her once a week with tapes secretly
recorded at the residences of their children _ two sons and a
daughter _ and other high officials, so she could keep tabs on them.
   Sources close to her entourage said she was cynical and paid no
attention to the real needs of the 23 million Romanians, whom she
despised.
   ``The worms never get satisfied, regardless of how much food you
give them,'' she was once overheard saying, referring to their
complaints about food shortages that plague Romania.

   A man armed with a hand grenade was
captured outside Bucharest's main Mitropolia cathedral during
Christmas service Monday after worshipers shouted that he was a
terrorist.
   The patriarch of the Romanian Orthodox Church, Teoctist Arapasu,
was preparing to address hundreds of worshipers who braved sporatic
gunfire to attend the service when the man, who carried an
identification card from the hated Securitate secret police, was
spotted.
   A woman and some other people started shouting, ``We know this
man, he's a terrorist.''
   Two soldiers and a group of civilians who acted as security in
front of the church jumped on the man, opened his raincoat. They
showed he was wearing a bulletproof vest and was armed with a hand
grenade.
   The man, taken away by soldiers armed with automatic rifles, did
not resist. The soldiers took the documents from the man and a
Securitate identification card.
   In the church, Arapasu thanked about 500 worshipers for coming
to the service despite the battles between a new government and
forces loyal to deposed Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
   Ceausescu was reported captured Saturday with his wife, Elena,
as the tried to flee a popular uprising. State radio announced the
Ceausescus were executed Monday after a secret trial at which they
were convicted of genocide and plundering of $1 billion in public
funds.
   The partiarch asked people to pray for ``the brave young people
who have given their lives in the struggle against Ceausescu's
terrorist regime.''
   ``We must thank God, who gave us freedom after 25 years of
terror,'' the patriarch told the congregation. ``Many of our church
services were banned by the terrorist regime. We must not let this
happen again.''
   The patriarch also thanked hundreds of people who brought
presents and food to the church in memory of the dead.
   ``I have been waiting 40 years for this. Now I can openly go to
church,'' said Ion Ganescu, a dissident who spent 10 years in
prison for his opposition to Ceausescu.

<TEXT>
   Romania's revolution against Communism,
unlike others in Eastern Europe, has exploded in volatile emotions
and violence against the repression enforced by the 24-year
dictatorship of Nicolae Ceausescu.
   Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, were reported to be executed on
Monday after a secret trial on charges of particularly grave crimes
against the people.
   No other East European country revolting in the name of
democracy has reacted in this way. But no other East European
country had a Ceausescu, whose unparalleled personality cult
trumpeted his ``golden era'' while imposing more and more hardship.
   As mandated debt repayment and industrialization programs
brought hardship to every Romanian, dissent was largely repressed
by his dreaded Securitate, a massive network of at least 700,000
people.
   Workers who dared to protest disappeared mysteriously.
Intellectuals, with a higher profile in society, faced prison,
mental hospital, internal exile or house arrest.
   Laws mandated the reporting of every unauthorized conversation
with a foreigner, the registration of every typewriter _ potential
weapons in the war of words against Ceausescu's rule _ and
censorship far more draconian than any other in the Soviet bloc.
   Everywhere in Eastern Europe, the existence of the censor lent
weight even to words written with little intention of riling
against the Communist rule despised across half a continent.
   In Romania, this was taken to the extreme. Dissident poet Ana
Blandiana, a member of the National Salvation Committee that is now
trying to run the Balkan country, had a book banned last year
simply for a poem about a ``Scallion.''
   For this ``Scallion,'' she wrote: ``Poems have been written, And
portraits painted.'' The regime assumed she was referring to
Ceausescu.
   Such actions revealed the near-paranoia of the Ceausescu regime,
a government headed by peasants turned revolutionaries then
dictators, whose total control knew none of the limits imposed on
aristocrats or monarchs by generations of breeding and sense of the
possible.
   Thus the Ceausescus and their children, reportedly drank,
gambled and lived the high life at will. Ion Pacepa, former chief
of counterintelligence who defected to the United States in 1978,
wrote in memoirs published last year that Elena Ceausescu listened
every week to tapes made at her children's apartments and the homes
of high officials.
   The Ceausescus regarded every aspect of public life as their
private property. In 1966, Ceausescu decreed that every Romanian
family should have four children _ a norm increased two years ago
to five kids per family.
   Few complied. But women were regularly subjected to
gynecological examinations at work to ensure that they were not
hiding any pregnancy they might try to abort for fear they could
not feed their own children.
   Blandiana once talked of the Romanians as an ``entire people
still unborn, yet condemned to be born ... through women's bodies
... never asked if they consented.''
   Citizens everywhere feared tight surveillance. On a flight out
of Romania in 1987, a Romanian exile living in Sweden talked
non-stop of the privations he had found on his first visit home in
five years, apologizing for burbling because he had been unable to
speak the truth for 10 days.
   The barefaced lies of officials in Romania angered even
Westerners who visited just for a few days. For citizens, it was
much worse.
   A Romanian now living abroad recalls, for instance, that one of
her closest friends once confided in a whisper in a private house
that her husband, a state official, would take her into the
bathroom and run water, speaking in a soft voice if he wanted to
tell her about anything _ however harmless _ at the office.
   Such repression was bound to explode in a cascade of words once
Ceausescu went. This is happening now all over Romania, where
makeshift committees in each town repeatedly denounce the regime.
   But the unparalleled repression, akin only to Josef Stalin's
Soviet Union, and not to any other East European country in 1989,
also bred the violence now seen on the streets of Bucharest.
   The revolt against Ceausescu was bred of that violence, and of
despair. The thousands of anti-government protesters who took to
the streets of Timisoara on Dec. 17, mown down by the gunfire of
security forces, braved death because despair had overcome fear in
their quest for bread and freedom.
   Knowing of the massacre, and the other revolutions that had left
their land the last bastion of Stalinism in the Warsaw Pact,
Romanians in several other cities also revolted.
   More carnage by the security forces convinced the army to come
over to their side early Friday. Then, desperation switched sides.
   Knowing that popular hatred of the dictator they once served
will suffice to kill them or put them behind bars, Ceausescu's
security forces began to draw arms caches and safe houses to shoot,
destroy and kill in a murderous last show of their power.
   It is as if the clock had turned back 44 years to the dying days
of World War II in Europe, when Soviet troops had to fight street
for street to gain control of Berlin from diehard Nazis who knew
they had only death to face if they surrendered.
   The National Salvation Committee is issuing repeated appeals to
the population not to take retribution for the years of privation
they suffered at the hands of Ceausescu and the Securitate.
   But a discussion of the most suitable punishment for the
captured dictator on Bucharest Radio Sunday, before the execution,
reflected the bitter hatred of a population that felt even a death
sentence would not pay them back for what they have endured.
   ``Ceausescu was a bastard,'' said Maria Stoica, a worker in
Bucharest. ``He shouldn't die quickly. He must pay for all the
crimes with which he poisoned us.''
   ``He killed us for 24 years,'' said Dumitru Grunea, a car
worker. ``Let him be tried before the people and executed the way
(18th century prince Constantin) Brincoveanu was killed.''
   Brincoveanu was beheaded by the Turks in Constantinople after
being forced to witness the executions of his own sons.
   Alluding to the meager supplies for which Romanians had to queue
six hours a day, an unidentified woman added, ``Ceausescu should
eat the meatless bones we were given as food.''

<HEAD>Tutu Condemns Israeli Treatment of Palestinians</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa on
Monday compared his country's suppression of blacks to Israel's
treatment of Palestinians in the occupied lands, where Christmas
celebrations were subdued because of the Arab uprising.
   The Nobel Peace Prize laureate came under increased criticism
from Jews and also Christians sympathetic to Israel, who accused
him of taking a one-sided approach to the Middle East conflict
during his five-day trip.
   ``Members of our team have remarked on the similarities between
the situation in the occupied territories and that in South
Africa,'' Tutu told reporters.
   ``In the methods of resistance used by Palestinians, and in the
ways the Israeli government deals with the resistance, we
experienced an extraordinary sense of being at home,'' he said.
   In the West Bank city of Bethlehem, hundreds of Christian
pilgrims marked Christmas with a visit to St. Catherine's basilica
in Manger Square, the legendary site of Jesus' birth.
   Israeli soldiers removed barricades and metal detectors from
Manger Square after Christmas Eve passed without incident. But the
military presence was heavy, and at least 50 paratroopers and
soldiers from the elite Givati brigade patrolled the square.
   ``I don't like it, but I guess it's for security,'' said Sara
Paredes, 20, of Fort Leavenworth, Kan. as she stood outside the
Church of the Nativity.
   Paredes said making a pilgrimage to Bethlehem was a ``dream''
for her, but added that she would like to return in the future when
tensions and security are lessened and ``when I can find a better
Christmas.''
   Twenty Palestinians were wounded after troops opened fire on
stone-throwing demonstrators in the Gaza Strip, Arab reports said.
   The army said it was investigating the reports.
   Tutu drew harsh criticism after he refused to meet with a
delegation of Ethiopian Jews, saying their visit to the St. George
Anglican Church in East Jerusalem was not on his schedule.
   ``He did not have time to sit with us, even for two or three
minutes,'' Yitzhak Rahamim, a spokesman for the Ethiopian
Immigrants Association told a reporter outside the church. ``I
heard he had time to meet with Palestinians, but not with Jews,
even with us from Africa.''
   Tutu met Monday with a group of prominent Palestinian leaders to
discuss the situation in the occupied territories, where
Palestinians began their revolt against Israeli rule in December
1987.
   The Jerusalem-based International Christian Embassy, headed by
Willem van der Hoeven, a Dutch Evangelist cleric, published a
statement denouncing Tutu's repeated expressions of support for
Palestinians.
   In the statement that was also sent to Israeli leaders, Van der
Hoeven wrote: ``we specifically apologize for the remarks made by
the visiting Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu...we bow our heads in
shame.''
   Tutu's endorsement of a Palestinian state has alienated many
Israelis, and Israel's two chief rabbis refused to meet with the
Anglican human rights leader.
   When asked to comment on criticisms of his visit, Tutu replied:
``The bible...speaks about Israel as being an agent of God for
establishing justice and peace, and there is no way I am going to
say the way Israel is treating Palestinians is just. And if they
revile me for that, tough luck.''

<HEAD>Queen Says All Nations Should Learn To Love Their Neighbors</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-World Christmas, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Queen Elizabeth II said in her annual Christmas
broadcast that ``it would be splendid'' if all nations learned to
love their neighbors and united to save the Earth from further
environmental damage.
   The queen also spoke of ``the exciting news'' that barriers
between Eastern and Western Europe were coming down and people on
both sides were beginning to think about their future as neighbors.
   ``It's still hard for us to be sure what is going to happen as a
result of these great events, but it would be splendid to think
that in the last years of the 20th century Christ's message about
loving our neighbors as ourselves might at last be heeded,'' she
said in the 11-minute broadcast.
   She addressed her message particularly to children in the
49-nation Commonwealth of Britain and its former colonies, saying
they brought out the best in grown-ups and ``part of that `best' in
us could be a particular tenderness towards this Earth which we
share as human beings.''
   ``If we can reduce selfishness and jealously, dishonesty and
injustice, the 90s can become a time of peace and tranquillity for
children and grown-ups, and a time for working together for the
benefit of our planet as a whole.''
   The queen broke a tradition of keeping her message secret until
Christmas by delivering part of it to an audience of 6,000 at
London's Royal Albert Hall last Tuesday night.
   Spotlighted in the hall's vast arena, the queen explained that
she wanted to use the presence of 2,000 children at the
fund-raising gala for the Save the Children charity to send a
special message to all children in the Commonwealth.
   A group of youngsters, whose parents work for Commonwealth high
commissions or embassies in London, were allowed to ask the queen
questions during intermission.
   She told them she found her crown ``quite heavy,'' admitted she
was sometimes nervous in front of big crowds and said she liked to
believe in Father Christmas, the English name for Santa Claus.
   One small girl asked, ``Do you like being the queen?'' The queen
replied indirectly, saying, ``It's a very busy life.''
   Another child asked, rather shyly: ``What are you going to buy
Prince William for Christmas?''
   With the 7-year-old prince, son of Prince Charles and Princess
Diana, hovering in the background, the queen neatly sidestepped,
replying: ``I don't think I had better say it too loudly. He might
hear me.''
   In her message, the queen said she received many letters from
people worried about the greenhouse effect caused by warming of the
Earth's atmosphere, crop devastation caused by floods and drought,
and the destruction of forests.
   ``These problems ... make neighboring cooperation throughout the
world a pressing necessity,'' she said. ``... The great thing to
remember is that it is not too late to reduce the damage if we
change our attitudes and behavior.''

   Christmas presents and two television

is with the U.S. invasion force fighting in Panama.
   The home of Sgt. Greg Widberg and his wife, Rachel, was broken
into sometime between 4 p.m. Thursday and 3:20 p.m. Friday,
according to a report by the Cumberland County Sheriff's Department.
   A 25-inch color TV valued at $400 and a 13-inch black-and-white
set valued at $50 were taken, as well as Christmas presents whose
value was not known because they had not been opened, the report
said.
   Mrs. Widberg was reached at a friend's house Monday but said she
did not want to comment on the theft. Her uncle, Samuel George,
said his niece is seven months pregnant and that her husband, a
paratrooper with the 82nd Airborne based at Fort Bragg, is with
U.S. forces in Panama.

   The world remembered Romania on Christmas Day with
candles, prayers, food and medical aid, and Bucharest's new
leadership received growing recognition as the legitimate
government.
   The United States established diplomatic relations with the
provisional government, although it expressed regret that deposed
leader Nicolae Ceausescu had not been tried in public before his
apparent execution.
   Bucharest radio said Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, were
executed after a secret military trial.
   ``The United States government pledges its support to the new
Romanian government as it struggles to achieve its announced
democratic values,'' said a White House statement.
   In Moscow, a top Foreign Ministry official said the Soviet Union
effectively recognizes the revolutionary leadership and is in
permanent contact via its embassy in Bucharest.
   However, Deputy Foreign Minister Ivan P. Aboimov repeated Soviet
disclaimers that military aid to the National Salvation Committee
was or had ever been planned.
   ``The point at issue today is humanitarian, medical and food
assistance,'' Vadim Perfilyev, a ministry spokesman, was quoted as
saying by the Soviet news agency Tass.
   The United States and France said Saturday they would not oppose
Soviet bloc intervention to support Romanians fighting police units
loyal to Ceausescu.
   At least 13 nations have recognized the National Salvation
Committee as the legitimate representative of the Romanian people.
In addition to Moscow and Washington, West Germany, Poland, Japan,
Sweden, Thailand and Yugoslavia added their recognition to a list
which already included France, East Germany, Norway, Belgium, the
Netherlands.
   In at least 27 countries, ambassadors from Romania also declared
their support for the provisional government in Bucharest. Those in
Japan and Baghdad announced their support Sunday.
   At the Vatican, Pope John Paul II prayed that the hope of
Christmas might spread through Eastern Europe, and sought a special
blessing for Romania, ``the noble land ... which is celebrating
this Christmas in fear and trembling, with sorrow for the many
human lives tragically lost and in the joy of having taken once
more the path of freedom.''
   In Britain, Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie lighted a
candle for Romania and led Anglicans around the world in prayers
for the thousands who suffered and died there for freedom.
   A vast revolution had started swiftly in Eastern Europe and was
still growing, he said. ``We thought it was all in the past _ the
suffering and deaths of dissidents who never compromised. In the
blood of Romania, the price is writ large in the present.''
   The Soviet Union was evacuating 280 dependents in Romania by
train after two Soviet citizens were wounded in Bucharest and 10
Soviet motorists were hurt in the Romanian-Yugoslav border region,
Perfilyev said. Several other countries have also evacuated the
families of diplomats.
   Around the world, hundreds of groups raised money for Romania,
and governments announced new financial support. The Irish Republic
said it was contributing $45,000 for medical and relief supplies.
   The French Health Ministry said all 1,200 public hospitals in
France are being mobilized to gather and expedite humanitarian aid
to Romania.
   In a statement, the ministry said people could go to any
hospital to donate money or goods, especially medicine, canned
food, blankets and new sheets.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said a
military plane carrying 25 tons of relief supplies flew from
Cologne to Bucharest on Monday. Foreign Ministry spokesman Hanns
Schumacher said it was still impossible to drive between Bucharest
airport and the city because of shooting on the road.
   Three military cargo planes carrying medical aid and blood from
the Polish Red Cross and the Defense Ministry left Poland for
Bucharest, the official PAP news agency said. Hundreds of Poles
lined up over the holiday weekend to donate blood, and hundreds of
doctors volunteered to travel to Bucharest to organize a Polish
hospital, Polish news media reported.
   Doctors Without Borders said its fifth planeload of doctors and
supplies for Romania took off from Paris on Sunday. Previous
flights landed in neighboring countries and entered by land, but it
was hoped this one could land in Bucharest.
   Britain also has sent planeloads of supplies.
   Dr. Francois Dumaine of Doctors Without Borders, who returned
Sunday from Romania, said in the city of Sibiu people feared the
water had been poisoned by security forces and were drinking only
from water trucks.
   Hungary sent aid consignments by car and truck across the border
and by military plane to Bucharest. The Bulgarian Foreign Ministry
said three ambulances with 12 medical personnel arrived in
Bucharest.
   Japan said it hopes to send emergency aid to Romania as soon as
possible, according to a senior Foreign Ministry official.
   On the diplomatic front, Genscher instructed Bonn's ambassador
to Bucharest, Klaus Terfloth, to inform the National Salvation
Committee that it was being recognized by West Germany, Schumacher
said.
   A Yugoslav government envoy, Assistant Foreign Secretary Ilija
Djukic, arrived in Bucharest on Monday to establish direct contact
with the Committee, the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported.
   The Solidarity-led government in Poland said it considered the
committee to be `the only reliable body representing Romania,''
according to PAP.
   In a dispatch from Beijing, Tanjug quoted unidentified
diplomatic sources as saying the Communist Party Politburo had
discussed ways of presenting the Romanian developments to the
Chinese public without ``rocking the boat.'' It said security
forces in the Chinese capital were put on first-degree alert when
news of the rebellion was finally announced.

of his car with a .32 caliber bullet in his heart, police radio
operator Edson Andrade said by telephone from Vitoria, 310 miles
northeast of Rio.
   Andrade said a bag containing the priest's cassock and his empty
wallet was found about 100 yards from the car.
   Mayra had been in Brazil nine years and worked in Vila Velha
parish eight miles south of Vitoria, he said.
   Andrade said Mayra had received death threats for his support of
an ousted mayor but ``was very well liked by the people here. The
crime had nothing to do with politics. It was a simple holdup.''

   More snow fell Monday on the frozen Deep South, where
Wilmington, N.C., had its most Christmas snow on record, and
Florida utilities asked people to turn off holiday decorations to
save electricity for heat.
   Citrus growers in Florida and southern Texas inspected frost
damage in their groves.
   Frozen rivers and pipes interfered with water supplies in some
southern cities, and the Carolinas dug out after a rare December
blizzard.
   Temperatures turned balmy across much of the Plains in the wake
of last week's surge of Arctic air that broke hundreds of low
temperature records. Nebraska warmed into the 40s and it was the
first time in 10 days that Indiana had no readings at or near zero,
the weather service said. But a new wave of cold began pushing
southward into Minnesota with wind chills of about 40 below zero.
   Sections of Georgia, northern Florida and northern Alabama got a
dusting of snow on Christmas, and light snow even was reported
along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico at Mobile, Ala.
   It was only the sixth time since 1878 that Atlanta got holiday
snow, and the first Christmas snow in Mobile since record-keeping
began in 1871.
   However, temperatures began to ease. At Birmingham, Ala., the
temperature rose to 33 degrees shortly before noon _ the first time
in 92 hours the mercury had been above freezing. Temperatures also
eased in Florida, but the day started with a record of 30 degrees
in Miami.
   The temperature fell to an all-time record low of zero at the
airport for Wilmington, N.C., which was partly paralyzed by the
cold and the record 15 inches of snow that fell Sunday. The
previous all-time low at Wilmington of 5 above had stood since
February 1899.
   Other record lows Monday, all in Florida, were 29 at Fort
Lauderdale, 46 at Key West, and a record-tying 33 at Miami Beach,
the National Weather Service reported, a far cry from last week
when temperatures hit record lows in more than 100 cities a day.
Monday's low for the Lower 48 states was 17 degrees below zero at
Houlton, Maine.
   Elsewhere, the cold prevented the annual re-enactment of George
Washington's famous Revolutionary War crossing of the Delaware
River to capture British troops at Trenton, N.J. ``We couldn't get
our four boats into the river because it was a sheet of ice,'' said
James Gallagher, who has played the role of Washington since 1985.
   Airports remained closed at Wilmington and at Myrtle Beach, S.C.
   Temperatures warmed up a few degrees in South Carolina, but on
the north coast, which received well over a foot of snow in places,
melting snow was expected to re-freeze on roads and make driving
treacherous during the night.
   Residents of Florida contended with rotating brownouts, and in
some instances blackouts, as utilities tried to keep up with demand
for electricity.
   Some people went without power for as long as 12 hours. ``You
can't heat a house, cook a meal or take a shower,'' said Ellen
Kirschner of Pinellas County.
   Mike Mahoney, spokesman for Tampa Electric Co., appealed Monday
to families in a six-county area to forgo Christmas tree lights to
save energy.
   Two of North Carolina's three main natural gas companies asked
consumers to turn down their heat Monday to ease demand on tight
supplies.
   ``We are drawing from all of our emergency supply sources,''
said Charles Zeigler, chairman and president of Public Service Co.
of North Carolina.
   Numerous burst water pipes were reported because of the cold,
and water pressure was low partly from people letting water run to
avoid frozen pipes.
   ``We've got low pressure all over the city because of the broken
lines and people can't conserve,'' said John von Sprecken, head of
the Mobile, Ala., water system.
   ``We probably have thousands of people with busted pipes. We've
shut off literally hundreds,'' Charleston Commissioners of Public
Works Manager Steve Kinard said Monday.
   A water crisis continued at Jackson, Miss., where five days of
cold had frozen the Pearl River, the city's source of water. City
and private crews worked to break ice around the municipal water
plant. The National Guard was called out Sunday to haul water to
the city.
   Water stood up to 2 feet deep in parts of Marshall, N.C., after
ice jammed at a dam, backing up the French Broad River.
   It was the second straight day of cold ravaging Florida's $3.5
billion citrus crop. Wind was light Christmas eve, meaning groves
that escaped unharmed the previous night suffered freeze damage.
Stiffer wind prevents frost from settling on the fruit.
   ``Apparently there is a lot of iced fruit,'' said Dick Whalley,
a spokesman for Florida Citrus Mutual, the state's big grower
cooperative.
   But strawberries fared better, said Roy Parke of Parkesdale
Farms, a berry farmer in Plant City, Fla. A lack of wind allows
irrigation systems to build an even layer of ice on fragile plants
to hold them at 32 degrees. Wind scatters the water from
sprinklers, allowing lower temperatures to get to the plants.
   ``We got good ice cover and I figure I'll be able to save 80
percent,'' Parke said Monday.
   At Harlingen, Texas, citrus grower Joe Kutzenberger said no
fruit that wasn't harvested before Friday and Saturday's cold can
be salvaged.
   ``It appears to me even the canneries wouldn't accept it because
the fruit has been frozen so bad,'' Kutzenberger said.

   Flu struck down Princess Diana, wife of the heir

the weekend, Buckingham Palace said.
   The princess was absent when her husband, Prince Charles,
parents-in-law Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, and other
royals worshiped at the church Sunday on the family's estate in
Norfolk.
   But Diana, 28, did attend a service Christmas Day, accompanied

   Britain has been swept by an unusually severe flu epidemic in

<HEAD>Snow and Record Cold for Christmas in the Southeast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Record lows were confined to the Southeast on Monday as a major
cold wave dwindled, but more cool air began moving into northern
Minnesota and heavy snow fell around Lake Superior.
   Monday's low of zero degrees at Wilmington, N.C., broke the
city's previous all-time record of 5 above, which had stood since
February 1899.
   The low of 33 degrees at Miami Beach, Fla., equalled that city's
record for all of December, established just the day before.
   Other record lows Monday, all in Florida, were 29 at Fort
Lauderdale, 46 at Key West, and 30 at Miami, the National Weather
Service reported, a far cry from last week when temperatures hit
record lows in more than 100 cities a day.
   A cold front nosed into the northern Plains region and the upper
Mississippi Valley during the afternoon, kicking up snow and gusty
wind that sharply reducing visibility in some areas.
   Squalls associated with the cold front produced heavy snow along
the shoreline of Lake Superior, and up to 12 inches of new snow was
possible by Tuesday in parts of western and central Upper Michigan
near the lakeshore, the weather service said.
   A weak storm system brought light snow to the Tennessee Valley
early Monday and snow flurries were reported as far south as the
central Gulf Coast. Mobile, Ala., reported snow on Christmas for
the first time since record-keeping began in 1871.
   Snow showers were scattered from Missouri and Tennessee to the
Great Lakes and western New England.
   Freezing drizzle was reported in northern Illinois during the
morning.
   Temperatures dropped below freezing early Monday across most of
the nation, with sub-zero readings reported across New England and
eastern New York state, and parts of West Virginia and coastal
North Carolina.
   Monday's low for the Lower 48 states was 17 degrees below zero
at Houlton, Maine.
   A warm front crossing the Great Lakes region, middle Mississippi
Valley and southern Plains spread more seasonable temperatures
eastward. Afternoon readings were in the 40s in the central Plains
and in the 50s across the southern Plains.

   Wounded soldiers told of being hit by gunfire
in Panamanian darkness and expressed delight at Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega's surrender as Army Secretary Michael P.W. Stone visited
them Monday.
   ``I feel glad that the beast is in chains,'' Army Staff Sgt.
Terence Merlo said of Noriega, the deposed Panamanian dictator, as
Stone made his way around Wilford Hall Medical Center. Merlo was
wounded in the abdomen.
   So far 250 soldiers, including 15 on Monday, have been brought
to San Antonio after being injured in Panama. Three died en route
and one died after arrival.
   Dozens have been returned to home bases or discharged, leaving
52 at Wilford Hall and 34 at Brooke Army Medical Center on
Christmas Day.
   ``Good luck to you all and thank you very much for everything
you have done,'' Stone said to the soldiers. He handed out Army
medallions as gifts.
   Stone said he and his wife had been in Panama just days before
fighting broke out.
   ``There was really an apprehension that something was going to
happen, and of course it did about a week after we were there,'' he
said.
   Stone later visited wounded Army soldiers at Brooke.
   Family members visiting Merlo, 40, of Jacksonville, Ala., sat
near his bed. He told Stone that he and fellow military police
officer Spec. Robert Cuschleg of Columbus, Ohio, _ who was in the
next hospital bed _ were ambushed by an unseen enemy in the
darkness the first day of the U.S. attack.
   Merlo told reporters he believes that Noriega's surrender to the
Vatican Embassy means it could delay his being brought to justice.
   ``I'm not sure that it was the best place for him to turn
himself in for us to get gratification and achieve our ends,''
Merlo said.
   Pfc. Mike Heyne, 21, of Ashland, Ohio, said he hoped Noriega's
move would allow American troops to come home soon.
   ``I'm glad he did it this early,'' said Heyne, who was injured
by mortar fire.
   A small jar containing some shrapnel doctors removed from his
waist sat next to his bed. Heyne said he planned to keep it as a
souvenir.
   Soldiers read newspapers reporting Noriega's surrender and
displayed Purple Hearts on their pillows or pajamas. Christmas
cards, flowers and gifts were on view throughout the Air Force
hospital.
   Relatives exchanged gifts with the soldiers and some attended
two Christmas Day worship services.
   Among those visiting Staff Sgt. Walter Thompson of Enterprise,
Ala., who was shot in the left arm, were his wife Barbara Thompson,
his mother, some cousins and a friend.
   ``I began to cry, because I knew he was OK,'' Mrs. Thompson
said, her voice choked with emotion, of the moment she first saw
her husband Saturday at Wilford Hall.
   Thompson said he kept going after he was struck, ``I was still
fighting. I didn't stop.''

   _The Rev. C. Jay Matthews and the Rev. Tony Minor, who helped
begin the ``Wings of Hope'' program in Cleveland, a national
church-based anti-drug program that was started earlier this year
in Atlanta by the Rev. Joseph Lowery, president of the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference. The program establishes drug
prevention committees, contacts leaders of public housing units to
recommend ``at-risk'' families for adoption, for care and support
and for training in parental skills, basic needs and spiritual
guidance. Churches are taught community organizing and drug
prevention strategies. Matthews and Minor lead a monthly rally and
``pray-in'' on corners where crack cocaine is sold.
   _Jeffrey Miller, principal of W.R. Thomas Junior High School in
Miami, who implemented an aggressive drug education program and
drug policies for the school once labeled ``Cocaine Alley'' by a
local newspaper. ``Every student knows we have a tough policy, and
they know what the rules are,'' said Miller, whose school has
experienced a 50 percent drop in the number of disruptive incidents
and no drug-related cases.
   _Frank Parks, athletic director of Spingarn High School in
Washington, D.C., which was certified ``drug-free'' by the U.S.
Department of Education last May, just a few years after
``marijuana and PCP were all over the building, and there was a
number of drug dealers in here,'' Parks said. Starting with
athletes ``because one athlete can influence 25 other kids,'' he
enlisted students in his efforts to create a peer counseling group
called SAND, Student Activities, Not Drugs.
   _Erma Scales, chairman of the Acres Homes War on Drugs Committee
in Houston. The community had been overrun with drugs, and Scales
said, ``We decided to stop the madness. We overcame in our
community.'' The neighbors wrote down license plate numbers of
drivers buying drugs, told police of alleged drug dealers, and tore
down abandoned buildings that were used as crack houses. Using
local business donations, the committee also has created an
anti-drug program including education, treatment, neighborhood
patrols and youth activities.
   _Margaret Toomey, manager of the Homes of Oakridge in Des
Moines, Iowa, which a year ago were surrounded by drug dealers. She
organized tenants through community get-togethers and meetings with
police and civic leaders, and she has evicted about 60 families
since 1988 because of drug problems. An ``Up with hope, Down with
Dope'' march attracted more than 1,000 participants, and the
residents have created project HOPE, the Homes of Oakridge
Prevention Effort, to educate young people about the dangers of
drug use and gang behavior. The program also has expanded adult
programs focusing on educational, vocational and career choices.
Toomey calls on residents to ``Stand up and be counted. Do it
cautiously, do it carefully, but do it,'' he urges.
   _Ruth Varnado and Queen Hyler, organizers of Milwaukee's Stop
the Violence Movement, who acted after a 9-year-old boy was killed
while playing in his back yard. With police cooperation, Milwaukee
citizens last July 9 took to the streets to confront the drug
dealers and express their outrage. The movement encourages
residents to report license plate numbers to police and it has
worked to remove drug paraphernalia from local stores. Church
visits to raise neighborhood consciousness often trigger a flood of
calls to the police.
   _Jean Veldwyk and Norm Chamberlain, leaders of the South Seattle
Crime Prevention Council in Seattle, Wash., who were shocked when
crack cocaine invaded their city several years ago. ``We discovered
the community could not simply sit on its hands and expect the
police to do everything,'' Veldwyk said. The council helps
neighborhoods form their own crime prevention programs, runs a
hotline for reports of drug dealing, gang activity and abandoned
cars, directs a graffiti cleanup program, conducts community
support activities, meets with legislators and works with police to
target drug ``hot spots.''

   On Christmas 1776, Washington was able to navigate the
ice-clogged river in darkness and surprise British troops camped at
Trenton, N.J. About 1,000 Hessian mercenaries on the British side
were captured and 100 were wounded or killed. Washington's force
suffered only 10 casualties.
   About 2,500 people braved the 20-degree cold Monday at
Washington Crossing State Park to witness the re-enactment,
cheering when 200 actors in revolutionary garb marched to the river.
   Although unable to cross the river, Gallagher posed in the bow
of a boat, wearing a colonial navy and buff uniform, covered with a
heavy navy cape, and wearing a tricorn hat.

   A private, non-profit corporation working for a
new stadium in Cleveland has no way of repaying $24.2 million in
real estate loans that have come due, but banks aren't upset.
   The obligation came due Saturday, but with planning for a new
stadium stalled, the Greater Cleveland New Stadium Corp. ``does not
have the resources to repay the debt at this time,'' said spokesman
Richard Shatten.
   The New Stadium group borrowed the money to acquire the stadium
site in the old Central Market neighborhood.
   A group of Cleveland banks loaned $18 million and the state
loaned $4 million. Both loans came due in full in June but the
banks and the state approved six-month extensions. Interest owed
amounts to $2.2 million.
   Edward Brandon, representing the group of banks, said Friday the
institutions would not move to collect the debt now.
   ``Officially, whether we extend or let it run past due, it
doesn't matter,'' said Brandon, who also chairs Cleveland-based
National City Corp. ``The only important thing is the banks haven't
gotten their backs up and don't feel they have been betrayed and
won't start legal proceedings.''
   Brandon said the banks supported current stadium development
talks among elected officials and would ``work toward seeing the
proper results come out of those conversations.''
   Joseph Marinucci, state deputy director of business development,
said a formal payment notice for the state's share of the debt
would go to the stadium group this week.
   ``We will ask them to provide to us, in writing, what they're
going to do,'' he said.
   Stadium talks are focusing on bringing local elected officials
to agreement on how to develop a new ballpark for the Cleveland
Indians and-or the Cleveland Browns.

   Manuel Antonio Noriega's decision to seek
asylum at the Vatican's embassy in Panama City forces President
Bush into the thicket of diplomacy and international law in pursuit
of his goal of bringing the deposed dictator to trial on drug
trafficking charges.
   ``Now it's up to the lawyers and the diplomats,'' summed up
Pentagon chief Dick Cheney, whose troops tried but failed to
capture the elusive dictator in more than four days of searching.
   When Noriega drove up to the Vatican embassy in Panama City on
Christmas Eve, Bush accomplished a central goal of the invasion he
ordered last week: removing the indicted drug trafficker from all
power in Panama.
   But how Bush, Panama's U.S.-backed government, the Vatican and
other nations handle the next step could determine not only
Noriega's fate, but the future of the strategically placed isthmus
for years to come.
   U.S. interests appear to be best served by Noriega's speedy
removal from the Papal Nunciature, where he is protected by
diplomatic immunity and by the spotlight of international
attention. As long as he stays, attention could be diverted from
U.S. efforts to restore order to the devastated country.
   In talks with Vatican officials in Rome on Monday, the Bush
administration delivered a forceful message demanding Noriega be
turned over to U.S. custody. The message was delivered ``in
extraordinarily tough terms,'' said one official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   But the Vatican, which has offered haven to Noriega's foes in
recent months, would have to reverse centuries of practice and
diplomatic principle to hand the general to the United States
against his will.
   Asked if a simple turnover were foreseeable, Vatican spokesman
Joaquin Navarro said, ``Well, I don't think so. There isn't an
extradition treaty or anything.''
   Bush, who has held several diplomatic jobs in his career,
presumably understands the complexities well. The United States has
been sheltering Chinese dissident Fang Lizhi in the U.S. Embassy in
Beijing for many months despite Chinese demands to hand him over.
   Bush could ask the government of U.S.-backed President Guillermo
Endara to demand Noriega be handed over by the Vatican. But Endara
has already said his country is forbidden by its constitution to
extradite any Panamanian citizen to the United States.
   Another solution could lie in removing Noriega from Panama to a
third country. The United States set a precedent for such a
scenario when it negotiated with Noriega in 1988 after he was
indicted in Florida, and again as recently as October.
   State Department officials were apparently prepared to drop
their demand for bringing Noriega to the United States if he agreed
to resign his posts. Later, the U.S. upped its ante and demanded
that Noriega leave Panama.
   Spain, Cuba and the Dominican Republic _ where Noriega has a
daughter and some real estate _ have been mentioned as possible
exiles. Until now, Noriega has refused to go.
   But in any deal Noriega works out, he would likely demand a
promise that he not be extradited to the United States.
   That could create a problem with Spain which has a 1970
extradition treaty with the United States.
   Foreign Minister Francisco Fernandez Ordonez said Monday that
Spain would not be a convenient place for Noriega to seek asylum
because he would have to be turned over to U.S. authorities on
drug-related charges.
   An exile closer to home could prove troublesome, if it left
Noriega close enough to foment resistance to the new Panamanian
government among former loyalists of his regime.
   ``Part of the deal would have to be that he promise not to
interfere in Panamanian politics,'' said James Goodby, a professor
of diplomacy at Georgetown University. ``The farther away he goes,
the better.''
   Even if Noriega were brought to this country, other
complications could stand in the way of a trial.
   Raymond Takiff, Noriega's attorney in Miami, said prosecution
would result in sensitive information being divulged about
Noriega's long association with the CIA. Federal prosecutors
familiar with the case say they believe a trial could go forward.
   The nature of the sensitive information could include material
relating to Bush himself.
   According to Kevin Buckley, who is writing a book for Simon and
Schuster about Noriega, the deposed Panamanian leader and Bush
first met in 1976. Bush headed the CIA at the time, and Buckley
said Noriega commanded his country's intelligence services.
   In 1983, Bush visited Noriega in Panama and reportedly hinted
that if the general helped the U.S.-backed Nicaraguan Contra
rebels, the United States would turn a blind eye to his drug profit
laundering, Buckley said. Bush has denied making any such promise.
   Noriega also met in 1985 aboard a yacht with former White House
aide Oliver North to discuss help for the Contras, according to
Buckley.
   ``He (Noriega) knows where a lot of skeletons are buried in
Central America and some of them may be very close to Bush's
office,'' said William Schneider, a senior fellow at the American
Enterprise Institute.

   A strong earthquake struck the Ungava Peninsula
of northern Quebec, Baffin Island and the eastern part of the
Northwest Territories on Christmas morning, but no damage or
injuries were reported.
   The quake, which occurred at 9:24 a.m. EST, measured 6.2 on the
Richter scale, said seismologist Robert North of the Ottawa office
of the Geological Survey of Canada.
   ``An earthquake over 6 points is a serious earthquake and can
cause severe damage in a populated area,'' North said.
   ``But fortunately the quake ... took place in a sparsely
populated area which has no large buildings, so the effects should
not cause any personal damage,'' he said.
   North said his office received a telephone call from the Inuit
village of Igloolik to report the quake. Iqaluit, on Frobisher Bay
in Baffin Island, also felt the temblor.
   Father Paul-Emile Tremblay, director of the Seismological
Observatory at Montreal's Jean de Brebeuf College, said the
epicenter was in the eastern part of the Northwest Territories and
the quake was felt within a 620-mile radius.
   ``We have been noticing low-level tremors in that area for some
time, so we were not surprised by the strong earthquake which
occurred on Christmas morning,'' he said.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph.

   A poet who had described deposed
President Nicolae Ceausescu as ``the most beloved son of the
Romanian people'' tried to take refuge Monday in the U.S. Embassy
to escape a crowd that wanted to lynch him.
   But army soldiers intervened and took Adrian Paunescu away after
embassy personnel would not let him enter, witnesses said.
   Paunescu, in his mid-40s, for years was responsible for running
``Song to Romania,'' a festival of music and poetry eulogizing
Ceausescu and his wife Elena.
   Ceausescu was overthrown Friday and captured a day later by the
army following a popular uprising. The couple was executed Monday,
state radio said, after being tried and found guilty of ``grave
crimes,'' including the deaths of 60,000 protesters and the
plundering of $1 billion in public money.
   Paunescu, who owns a 10-room villa in downtown Bucharest
complete with a swimming pool and sauna, was considered Ceausescu's
court poet for many years until he fell into disfavor in 1985, when
police reportedly found he was involved in orgies at home and had
illegally built an Alpine retreat at Breaza, north of Bucharest.
   Under Ceausescu, Romanians were allowed to own just one home.
   When it became apparent that Ceausescu's demotion would be
imminent, Paunescu tried to address a rally in the palace square in
front of the Communist Party headquarters Friday to criticize the
dictator, but was booed by the crowd.
   In 1973, when bookstores were filled with volumes bearing
Ceausescu's picture entitled ``Homage,'' Paunescu said the book was
issued ``as a rousing evocation of the reverberations produced in
the mind of the Romanian nation by the anniversary of the most
beloved son of the Romanian people _ President Nicolae Ceausescu.''

   Volunteers in two cities hustled on Christmas day to cook up and
serve replacement donations after thieves stole thousands of
dollars worth of food for the needy, and it was the 50th Christmas
for Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.
   ``As far as Christmas goes, this is it, folks,'' Col. John
Richardson told The Charlotte Observer on Sunday from Panama, where
he was leading a task force of troops from Camp Lejeune near
Jacksonville, N.C. ``No sign of Bob Hope.''
   Several dozen pro-choice and AIDS activists demonstrated outside
St. Vibiana's Cathedral in downtown Los Angeles to protest the
Roman Catholic Church's stance against abortion and the use of
condoms. As Archbishop Roger Mahony said a Christmas mass Monday
morning, demonstrators carried signs that said ``Jesus Saves Souls.
Condoms Save Lives.''
   A Chicago center was back in business handing out food Christmas
Day after thieves stole thousands of dollars worth of turkeys,
hams, toys and clothing collected for a traditional Christmas Eve
giveaway to 1,500 needy people.
   ``We've had calls and people coming in from all over the city,''
Frank Campbell, spokesman for the Paul Hall Community Services
Center, said Monday. ``It's really been something to see. ... We'll
be here giving out food until everything runs out.''
   The hungry and homeless sat down at Atlanta's annual Christmas
feast and were served pizza _ because turkeys and a lot of
trimmings were stolen shortly before the meal was to begin.
   ``Luckily, people have answered our radio plea and are bringing
food to us,'' said Elizabeth Williams-Omilami, daughter of the
event's organizer, civil rights leader Hosea Williams. They had
estimated earlier that they could feed up to 40,000 and still
insisted they could feed everyone who showed up.
   U.S. soldiers injured in Panama and recovering at Wilford Hall
Medical Center in San Antonio exchanged presents with relatives in
specially set up rooms, said Staff Sgt. Rey Adame, a hospital
spokesman.
   Area residents volunteered to help sort gifts, cards and letters
sent to the GIs injured in Panama.
   ``You look around, you'll see the Yuletide season all over the
place here,'' Adame said.
   The children of the advertising copywriter who created Rudolph
50 years ago for a Montgomery Ward's promotion booklet said they
are grateful year-round for the residual payments they still get
from the storybook reindeer who guided Santa's sleigh with his
shiny nose.
   The writer's daughter, Elizabeth Decker of Lake Bluff, Ill.,
says that every Christmas season her father, Robert May, used to
look out the window at a statue of the reindeer and say ``Thank
you, Rudolph.''
   In Watsonville, Calif., 1,400 families stood in a line around
the block Christmas Eve waiting for the city's annual toy giveaway.
It took on new meaning this year after an estimated 1,200 homes and
businesses were destroyed in the agricultural town near the
epicenter of the Oct. 17 earthquake.
   George Romano, who has been collecting for victims since shortly
after the quake, delivered 5,000 toys to children living in a
makeshift trailer park.
   In the Los Angeles suburb of Monrovia, police Officer Ruben
Gonzalez said he was touched by the sight of a little girl crying
when her home went up in flames Saturday night.
   Fellow officers came up with $500, an amount matched by the
Monrovia Police Association. The six children of two families that
were ousted by the fire were given gifts to unwrap Christmas
morning in their Red Cross-provided hotel.
   Donations also came from a bike shop, a grocery store, and a
coffee shop Gonzalez stopped at during a break on his graveyard
shift. A tree lot donated a tree that was decorated with ornaments
taken from the police station tree.
   ``I didn't realize people would be so giving,'' Gonzalez said
Christmas Eve.
   Elsewhere in southern California, Christmas was a day for
bare-chested natives to smear on tanning oil and soak up some rays,
or try out Christmas gift surfboards and wetsuits.
   On the same day Miami had a record low of 30, the noon
temperature was 81 degrees in Oxnard, 78 in downtown Los Angeles
and 77 in Santa Barbara, Santa Monica, Oceanside, San Diego and
Palm Springs.
   ``I am really happy to be in L.A. We don't have a lot of
palms,'' said Christina Giourdas, a Lufthansa flight attendant from
West Berlin who visited a Venice beach cafe on Christmas Eve.

   A long way from home on Christmas,
U.S. soldiers in Panama shared food with children, gave rations to
refugees and found themselves surrounded by swarms of residents
pouring out words of gratitude.
   Clad in their familiar camouflage fatigues and helmets, the
troops were warmly greeted by Panamanians during military patrols
Monday.
   Sgt. 1st Class Phillip Baker of Fayetteville, N.C., was one of
dozens on guard duty near the Vatican mission, where Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega sought refuge Sunday.
   As troops ringed the building near Panama Bay, residents left
their homes to jot down names and telephone numbers of dozens of
soldiers so they could call the soldiers' families in the United
States and wish them a merry Christmas.
   ``I can't believe they offered to call home for us,'' Baker
said. ``Some kids came by with Christmas cards they'd made for us.
I'm going to take them home and frame them.''
   At an Army command post near Santo Tomas Hospital, infantrymen
put up a tiny Christmas tree and a sign saying ``Feliz Navidad.''
They were sharing their food with neighborhood children and
families.
   ``Last night, people came over and wished us a Merry Christmas.
It's been a real nice Christmas,'' said Sgt. Clay Carnahan of
Lubbock, Texas. ``It makes you feel real good.''
   In David, 200 miles west of Panama City, troops, helicopters and
warplanes took over an airport and a military outpost that had
housed Noriega loyalists.
   As news of their arrival spread, many residents came out and
cheered the passing soldiers. One resident offered a soldier beer.
   ``No, we want Coca-Cola,'' a resident said a soldier told
passengers in a bus. ``So people came out of the bus and gave them
Coke and soft drinks.''
   In the former Canal Zone city of Balboa, troops passed out
rations to refugees in a soccer stadium and put up large tents.
   The homeless formed orderly lines for Army rations.
   ``We served more than 8,000 meals last night,'' Boston-born Army
Col. William Connolly reported.
   Thousands of Panamanians, escaping the gunfire, bombings and
sniper attacks that began with the American invasion last Tuesday,
were being housed in churches, schools and stadiums throughout the
capital.
   As the fighting waned and Noriega's men surrendered, Panamanians
were grateful for peace on Christmas.
   Panamanian insurance adjuster Bill Heron was one of those taking
down names and U.S. phone numbers of soldiers on neighborhood
patrols.
   ``It's the least we can do,'' he said. ``It's our Christmas gift
to them.''
   Heron said the U.S. troops had made this the best Christmas he'd
had in 21 years, since Noriega's predecessor, the late Gen. Omar
Torrijos, took over in a coup.
   ``God. I don't know how to express it,'' he said. ``But we're so
grateful.''

<TEXT>
   Investigators on Monday slogged through
firefighting foam and charred remains of storage tanks damaged in a
deadly explosion and fire at the nation's second largest
petrochemical refinery.
   The intense blaze at the Exxon refinery burned for 15 hours
before it was extinguished at 5 a.m. Monday, said company spokesman
Dave Gardner.
   One contract worker died Sunday when his pickup caught fire in
the explosion. Crews searched Monday for an Exxon employee missing
following the blast, Gardner said.
   Flames engulfed eight storage tanks holding more than 4 million
gallons of oil and lubricants, and two separator units, which
remove water from oil, officials said.
   It was believed to have been ignited by a gas release, but what
caused the release was under investigation, said plant Manager Ed
Galante.
   ``A maintenance work center, a building that was in the area
that used to be a small office satellite complex, was destroyed,''
Gardner said. ``Luckily there was nobody in there.''
   Production was halted at the refinery, which has a capacity of
455,000 barrels _ more than 19 million gallons _ of crude oil a
day. Exxon spokesman Ron Embry said he did not know whether that
would worsen any shortages of home heating oil during the nation's
record-setting cold snap.
   ``Generally, the limit to fuel oil seems to be due to
transportation problems in bad weather, and not supplies,'' Embry
said.
   Two investigative teams have been assembled, one to determine
the cause of the accident and another to assess the damage and
decide what's necessary to get the plant back in operation, Gardner
said.
   ``It will take some time and some effort. At this point, it's
almost impossible to say how much,'' he said.
   The worker killed in the blast was identified as mechanic Harold
Guillory, 31, of Irwinville, an employee for contractor Vernon
McKenny Enterprise, Gardner said.
   Guillory died when his pickup truck caught fire 100 to 200 feet
from the explosion, Gardner said.
   The missing Exxon worker was not identified and no other
information about his disappearance was released. His family has
been notified, Gardner said.
   Three Exxon employees and four contract workers were treated for
injuries at Baton Rouge hospitals and released Sunday, Gardner said.
   ``Numerous employees had cuts and bruises but didn't go to
hospitals,'' Galante said.
   A skeleton crew was on duty because of the Christmas holiday, he
said.
   The blast shattered windows up to six miles away and was felt up
to 15 miles away. The fire sent a plume of thick, black smoke 500
feet into the air.
   Gov. Buddy Roemer called out 50 National Guardsmen overnight to
prevent looting of stores where plate-glass windows were blown out.
Initial reports said looters hit some stores, but police Lt. Willie
Stevens said Monday that there had been no arrests.
   The refinery, on the Mississippi River in North Baton Rouge, has
been on the site since 1909.
   Petroleum inspectors David Abshire and Wiley Aymond said they
were 300 feet from the tanks when they exploded.
   ``The explosion caved in the whole side of the building,''
Abshire said. ``We would have been worse off if we were inside
because of the all the flying glass.
   ``When I looked up, I saw the sky full of stuff, pieces of wood,
insulation, just a sky full of stuff,'' he said. ``I was in a daze
and was just running in circles, looking for some place to get away
from it all, and there was no place to go.''
   The blast temporarily knocked out electricity and telephone
service in the area and forced the closure of a section of nearby
Interstate 110 for the night.
   State Department of Environmental Quality workers monitored air
outside the plant, but Roemer said the burning chemicals were all
non-toxic hydrocarbons: propane, ethane and diesel fuels. An area
around the area was closed to incoming traffic for a time, but no
evacuations were ordered.

<TEXT>
   The government said Monday it
foiled an attempted coup against the 2-year-old government of
President Blaise Compaore, but denied reports that it executed
seven of those arrested.
   Justice Minister Antoine Komi Sambo told a news conference
``foreign mercenaries'' were among those arrested, but he refused
to provide any details.
   He said those arrested would be brought before the courts of
this landlocked West African former French colony, once known as
Upper Volta.
   Burkina Faso, with a population of more than 8.5 million, gained
independence in 1960.
   In Paris, the Burkinabe League of Human Rights issued a
statement protesting the arrests and what it called repression by
the country's ``military dictatorship.''
   ``As of Dec. 25, more than 50 people have been arrested, and
their number is likely to double in the days to come, according to
disquieting information coming from Burkina Faso,'' it said.
   Earlier Monday, the French news agency Agence France-Presse
quoted what it called well-informed sources in Ouagadougou as
saying seven people were executed Sunday night and Monday morning,
and about 30 others, mostly soldiers, were arrested.
   Compaore took power Oct. 15, 1987, in a military coup that left
President Thomas Sankara among those slain. Officials reported
another aborted coup last September and said four alleged plotters
were executed summarily, including the men who were No. 2 and No. 3
in Compaore's government.
   The justice minister did not disclose on Monday when any of the
latest events took place, nor did he disclose any details of the
coup attempt.
   The League of Human Rights, a Paris-based group of Burkina Faso
exiles, said it had no further specifics on the attempt.

   The U.S. Army said Monday it found
idols, potions and other evidence that Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
practiced a form of occult worship.
   At a house at Fort Amador on the edge of the capital,
specialists with the Army Civilian Investigation Command showed
reporters items indicating that Noriega practiced ``santeria.''
   Noriega, meanwhile, was waiting in the Vatican mission for word
on his plea for asylum after U.S. troops invaded Panama last week
and drove him from power. He fled to the mission Christmas Eve.
   Army agent James Dibble, a specialist in the occult, defined
santeria as a worship of saints usually used as appeasement of God,
but which can be used for malevolent purposes as well.
   Various potions and colored ribbons contained names, pictures
and documents belonging to Noriega's political enemies, including
President Bush, former President Ronald Reagan and the new
Panamanian president, Guillermo Endara.
   Endara's photo was found in a ball of what appeared to be corn
dough wrapped in colored ribbons.
   A tray of unidentified red slime contained the government
identification card and original birth registration of Roberto
Eisenmann, co-founder of the opposition newspaper La Prensa.
   The items included a maggot-infested cow's tongue that had nails
driven through it. It was in a bowl covered with corn and rotten
eggs and wrapped in a cloth. The name of the person, written on a
slip of paper, was not legible.
   Dibble said the ribbons and potions represent specific saints.
   Army specialists said they think Noriega brought in a prominent
santeria practitioner from Brazil.
   Spirit cults, which originated in Africa, are popular throughout
the Caribbean, Brazil and much of South America. Among cult
followers are people from all social and economic classes.

   Rival Shiite Moslem militias fought in
south Lebanon Monday for a third day with grenades and mortars. Six
people died and 42 were wounded, police said.
   The casualties brought the three-day toll to 38 killed, 150
wounded, police said.
   Police said the Syrian-armed Amal and its rival, Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God, poured tank fire, mortar shells and
rockets on each other's strongholds all afternoon in Ein Kama and
Kfar Kila villages in the al-Tuffah region.
   Each accused the other of starting the fighting in the villages
about five miles northeast of Sidon, south Lebanon's provincial
capital.
   The latest round of fighting began before dawn Saturday when
Hezbollah overran four Amal-held villages. Amal rushed in
reinforcements Sunday and recaptured two villages.
   The two factions have fought for 2{ years for supremacy over
Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites, the country's largest sect.
   Since May 1987, such fighting has killed 609 people and wounded
1,719.

   Millions of Eastern Europeans celebrated their first free
Christmas in four decades: political prisoners rejoined their
families, East Germans and Czechoslovaks watched Mass on TV, and
Romanians listened to carols long-banned on state radio.
   Pope John Paul II prayed for Romanians ``celebrating this
Christmas in fear and trembling,'' mourned the thousands killed
overthrowing their Communist leaders, and praised the democratic
reforms remaking his native Eastern Europe.
   The Soviet Union's Baltic republics enjoyed the first official
Christmas holiday allowed by the Communists.
   Panamanians and U.S. soldiers spent Christmas on the lookout for
snipers.
   Church bells pealed across Czechoslovakia to mark the new
freedoms won in a pro-democracy movement that toppled Communist
leaders, created a free press and brought promises of free
elections.
   ``I feel like this is a miracle,'' said Ivan Martin Jirous, who
was reunited with his family after being released from prison one
month ago. Jirous, 45, was imprisoned more than eight years for
``subversive'' acts such as unauthorized lecturing and publishing.
   ``Everybody is so happy, so cheerful. It is euphoric with
everybody chatting about the future,'' said Dagmar Vogel, 22, home
for Christmas for the first time since her family fled their
homeland when she was 15 months old.
   On Prague's 15th century Charles Bridge, young carolers sang
haunting, traditional Christmas melodies. In previous years, police
chased carolers from the broad, cobbled King's Road.
   Millions attended Mass or watched an unprecedented live TV
broadcast of one in Prague's 13th century Strahov Monastery. It was
said by Vaclav Maly, a dissident priest who was banned for 11 years
for his human rights activities.
   In Berlin, people from both sides of the divided city mingled
freely, attending joint church services for the first time since
the Berlin Wall was built 28 years ago. East Germany on Sunday
began allowing visa-free travel by West Germans and thousands used
the opportunity to cross to East Berlin to join relatives for a
Christmas service.
   East Germans also watched their first Mass on television, as the
pope delivered his traditional Christmas message in 53 languages
from St. Peter's Square in Rome. Many of his remarks were aimed at
Eastern Europe.
   ``May this Europe open her doors and her heart to understand and
receive the anxieties, the fears and the problems of the nations
which seek her help,'' he prayed.
   ``May she respond with the strength and the generosity of her
Christian roots to this very special moment of history ... which
the world is now experiencing as if awakened from a nightmare and
opened up to a better hope.''
   ``In particular, bless at this hour, O Lord, the noble land of
Romania, which is celebrating this Christmas in fear and trembling,
with sorrow for the many human lives tragically lost and in the joy
of having taken once more the path of freedom,'' the pope said.
   Amid the sounds of gunfire on the streets of Bucharest were the
sounds of Christmas songs and carols, broadcast by Radio Bucharest
for the first time since the Communist takeover in December 1947.
   Yugoslav and Finnish journalists brought Christmas presents for
children in the western Romanian town of Timisoara, provided by a
Yugoslav candy company, the state news agency Tanjug reported.
   Also for the first time in four decades, Bulgarian radio and TV
broadcast the speech of Christmas and New Year by the head of the
Bulgarian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Maxim.
   It was a working day in Bulgaria, ``but people are wishing merry
Christmas to each other, maybe for the first time without fear that
they would be accused of being `religious,''' the state news agency
BTA reported.
   In the Baltics, which have large populations of Roman Catholics
and Protestants, all offices were closed for the first official
Dec. 25 holiday in the four decades of Soviet rule there.
   In Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, Roman Catholic activist
Antanas Terleskas said many people attended church on Christmas
Eve. But he said people were not especially happy, because ``the
freedom of expressing religious beliefs is just an illusion we are
permitted to toy with.''
   Estonians watched religious programs with Christmas carols on
TV, as well as the pope's Mass. It also was seen in Latvia, where
all TV and radio programs were religious oriented.
   Christmas in most of the vast Soviet Union will be celebrated
Jan. 7, according to the Russian Orthodox calendar.
   In London, Queen Elizabeth II spoke in her annual Christmas
broadcast about ``the exciting news'' that the barriers were coming
down in Europe and people in the East and West were beginning to
think about their future as neighbors.
   ``It would be splendid to think that in the last years of the
20th century Christ's message about loving our neighbors as
ourselves might at last be heeded,'' she said.
   In Bethlehem, Christians from around the world prayed at the
site of Jesus' birth, but it was a subdued Christmas overshadowed
by the Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
   In Lebanon, newspapers, radio and TV stations released
morale-boosting messages to eight American hostages, but there was
no way of knowing if the messages reached them. Terry Anderson,
chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press, and
educator Thomas Sutherland marked their fifth Christmas in
captivity.
   The Americans are among 18 foreign hostages in Lebanon, most
believed held by Shiite Moslem extremists. Anderson was abducted
March 16, 1985.
   South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu worshiped at the Anglican
St. George's church in Jerusalem's Arab sector. He was criticized
by Christian and Jewish leaders for supporting the creation of a
Palestinian state.
   ``But we say also, dear brothers and sisters, the Jews have a
right to their independent state as well,'' Tutu said.
   Philippine President Corazon Aquino urged her countrymen to
``regain the momentum'' lost in the recent coup attempt, as
thousands of candles flickered in front of homes, businesses and
military camps in a Christmas Day plea for peace.
   About 200 Cambodian refugees prayed for peace in their village
of exile in Thailand, Site B, exactly 11 years after Vietnam
invaded their homeland and started the continuing civil war.
   ``I pray to God that I can go back to my country,'' said Sau
Rany, 22, a religion teacher who wants to be a nun.

   A Panamanian officer indicted along with
deposed dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega on drug-related charges was
escorted to Miami on Monday by U.S. drug enforcement agents, the
Justice Department announced.
   Lt. Col. Luis del Cid, a Noriega loyalist who commanded a Panama
Defense Forces unit in the province of Chiriqui, gave himself up to
U.S. forces in Panama, said spokeswoman Deborah Burstion-Wade.
   Del Cid was one of 15 Noriega associates indicted in February
1988 by a federal grand jury in Miami. He is wanted on four counts
related to cocaine possession and laundering drug profits, the
spokeswoman said.
   After turning himself in, del Cid was arrested by agents of the
Drug Enforcement Administration in Panama, she said.
   DEA agents escorted him to Miami. ``Normally he would have been
flown in by U.S. marshals, but this was not an ordinary case,'' she
said.
   Ms. Burstion-Wade said Monday night that del Cid had been taken
to the Metro Correctional Institute, a federal facility in Miami.
His initial court appearance was scheduled for Tuesday afternoon,
and U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtenin is to handle the matter for the
government, she said.
   Del Cid surrendered on Saturday and declared loyalty to the new
government of Guillermo Endara, installed as president last week
after U.S. troops invaded Panama to remove Noriega from power.
   The Miami indictment unsealed Feb. 5, 1988 against Noriega, del
Cid and others alleges that the ousted strongman accepted a $4.6
million bribe from Colombia's Medellin cartel to protect shipments
of cocaine, launder money, supply drug laboratories and shield drug
traffickers from the law.
   A separate federal grand jury in Tampa, Fla., indicted Noriega
several days later on charges of taking another $5.4 million bribe
from the Colombia drug cartel.
   The Justice Department has said that if Noriega is brought to
the United States, he would be tried first in Miami because the
prosecutors' case there was stronger than in Tampa.

   U.S. troops kept a vigil Monday on
the Vatican mission where Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega sought asylum
as U.S. officials demanded the former strongman be turned over for
trial in the United States.
   Fighting was reported Monday night in downtown Panama City, and
diplomats reached at the Spanish Embassy said the nearby Chamber of
Commerce was on fire. U.S. troops in the area said they were taking
sniper fire about two hours after a 6 p.m. curfew.
   Dozens of U.S. soldiers, armored vehicles and helicopters ringed
the Vatican mission, where Noriega turned himself in Sunday five
days after the U.S. invasion overthrew his government, blasted his
headquarters and drove him into hiding.
   In Washington, the administration demanded ``in extraordinarily
tough terms'' that Vatican authorities turn Noriega over, a State
Department source said.
   Negotiations have brought ``a Mexican standoff,'' the official
said, with church authorities rebuffing the request and trying _
unsuccessfuly so far _ to find a country to take Noriega.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, who arrived in Panama City to be
with U.S. troops Christmas Eve, said at a news briefing Monday that
Noriega had been ``very skillful'' in eluding capture and moving
every night.
   Cheney called the U.S. invasion ``the most surgical operation of
its size ever carried out, not only by our forces but by anybody
else's forces.''
   After congratulating U.S. soldiers on their mission and touring
Noriega's battered headquarters, Cheney met with leaders of the new
U.S.-backed government. He reiterated Washington's desire to have
Noriega brought for trial in the United States.
   The area of Monday night's fighting includes the Cuban Embassy,
which is surrounded by U.S. troops, as well as the Foreign
Ministry, where the government of new President Guillermo Endara
has set up shop.
   The secretary of the Spanish Embassy, Javier Herrera, said his
embassy's personnel lay on the floor during the firing, which
slackened after 45 minutes. He said Spanish Ambassador Tomas Lozano
called a U.S. colonel in charge of operations in the area and the
colonel said, ``I'm on the ground, too.''
   With the manhunt for Noriega over, Panamanians living in refugee
camps and Americans on patrol found something to celebrate. Near
Santo Tomas Hospital, infantrymen put up a tiny Christmas tree at
their post and a sign saying ``Feliz Navidad.'' They shared their
food with people from the neighborhood.
   ``Last night, people came over and wished us a Merry Christmas.
It's been a real nice Christmas,'' said Sgt. Clay Carnahan of
Lubbock, Texas. ``It makes you feel real good.''
   Garbage trucks moved through downtown. Workers shoveled
mountains of trash, the debris of frenzied looting, into the
vehicles as U.S. military police patrolled the streets and armored
vehicles stood guard.
   Endara, the U.S.-backed leader who took power minutes after the
U.S. invasion, visited refugees during a Christmas Mass at a camp
in a soccer stadium. He refused to comment on Noriega's status,
saying, ``It is a very delicate diplomatic matter with the papal
state.''
   The Vatican said Noriega took refuge in the embassy Sunday after
``expressing the will to end the conflict'' between U.S. soldiers
and his supporters.
   Vatican, Panamanian and U.S. officials could not say if Noriega
would be handed over to the United States, where he faces drug
charges, or be given asylum in another country. The Vatican has no
extradition treaty with the United States.
   Sources in Panama familiar with the situation told The
Associated Press the papal nuncio mentioned the possibility of
Noriega going to Spain or Cuba.
   Gen. Maxwell Thurman, chief of the U.S. Southern Command, said
he ordered the embassy surrounded to prevent supporters from
``blowing into the place.''
   U.S. soldiers had surrounded the Cuban, Libyan and Nicaraguan
embassies to prevent Noriega from seeking refuge there, but no U.S.
troops were around the Vatican building when Noriega drove in
Sunday afternoon.
   Asked why, Cheney said at the briefing: ``We had our hands full
carrying out our basic mission. ... We could not come in and
surround literally every embassy in Panama in the hopes that you
could head off Mr. Noriega.''
   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro said Monday the ``concerned
parties'' would examine Noriega's case. Asked if a ``simple''
turnover of Noriega to the United States was foreseeable, Navarro
replied, ``Well, I don't think so. There isn't an extradition
treaty or anything.''
   The Vatican depicted the situation as an opportunity to bring
peace to Panama, and indicated it knew of Noriega's position before
he showed up Sunday afternoon.
   ``I can announce with satisfaction that the conflict in Panama
seems to be nearing a solution without further shedding of blood,''
a statement issued in Vatican City said.

   Most in the capital of 1 million faced a miserable Christmas due
to the shortage of food, medicine and other goods caused by the
looting. But news Noriega turned himself in brought hundreds of
elated people into the streets.
   ``Now we can have Christmas!' said one celebrant.
   On Monday, editors of the opposition newspaper La Prensa entered
their building for the first time since Noriega shut it down Feb.
25, 1988. Much of the equipment was destroyed and they were
uncertain when they could publish.
   Also Monday in Washington, the Justice Department announced a
Panamanian officer who was indicted along with Noriega on drug
charges was flown to Miami by agents of the Drug Enforcement
Administration. Lt. Col. Luis del Cid, a loyalist who commanded a
unit in western Chiriqui province, surrendered Saturday.
   U.S. troops also arrested Mario Rognoni, a commercial minister
under Noriega, according to witnesses who saw him being taken from
his house. It was not known why he was apprehended. Earlier,
Rognoni's name appeared on a communique from a pro-Noriega party
declaring itself ``in democratic and peaceful opposition to the
government imposed by the invading forces.''
   U.S. military officials said most members of Noriega's
15,000-member Defense Forces are surrendering and the resistance of
his loyalists has died. U.S. troops arrived in David, 200 miles
west of Panama City and took the airport and a Panamanian military
headquarters.
   Helicopters dropped tens of thousands of ``safe conduct passes''
in resistance areas for Noriega loyalists who want to turn
themselves in to U.S. military headquarters.
   Lt. Col. Jerry Murguia told a Southern Command briefing in the
capital on Monday that U.S. troops captured Santiago, 120 miles
southwest of Panama City, taking 188 prisoners and seizing hundreds
of small arms.
   In the soccer stadium at Balboa next to the Panama Canal, U.S.
troops fed and assisted up to 10,000 Panamanian refugees who had
the fighting. Panama's archbishop celebrated a Christmas Mass.
   In his homily, Archbishop Marcos McGrath called for ``a new
Panama without revenge or hate'' and urged looters to return stolen
goods.
   The fighting that broke out after the U.S. invasion, launched
early Wednesday, left much of Panama City in chaos.
   The Pentagon issued new casualty figures. The death toll of U.S.
troops stood at 23, revised downward by one from Sunday because one
victim was counted by two different units. There were 303 U.S.
wounded, none missing and two dependents killed.
   It said Noriega's routed Panamanian Defense Forces suffered 290
dead, 121 wounded, and 3,780 captured or detained. Panamanian
doctors said more than 100 civilians were killed and hundreds more
injured.
   ``One single person is guilty of all this. So much death because
of one man, and that man's name is Manuel Antonio Noriega,'' said
goldsmith Ruben Camargo, whose home in the Chorrillo neighborhood
next to Noriega's headquarters was destroyed.

   A Christmas Eve fire that killed 16
and injured dozens at a high-rise retirement home might have been
worse if so many people hadn't been away for the holiday,
authorities said Monday.
   Officials accounted for 10 of 11 residents who had been listed
as missing after the blaze at the 11-story John Sevier Retirement
Center. The 11th person is also believed to have been away at the
time, they said.
   ``I can't think of a worse time, on Christmas Eve,'' said P.C.
Snapp, mayor of this town of 40,000. ``On the other hand, it could
have been a good time because a number of people had gone to visit
relatives.''
   The blaze surged through the lower floors of the brick building,
sending thick smoke to the floors above. Residents of upper floors
waved flashlights and screamed for help from the windows of their
smoke-filled apartments.
   About 50 people were injured, including about 15 firefighters,
some of whom also suffered frostbite. Most were treated for smoke
inhalation and released. At least one person was seriously burned,
said Dan Blevins, spokesman for Northside Hospital.
   The cause of the fire was under investigation.
   ``My personal feelings are, it was an accidental fire,'' said
Lt. George Leonard, city fire marshal.
   The building, a former hotel renovated in 1977 and turned into
an apartments for retirees, didn't have sprinklers but had water
hoses on each floor.
   The fire marshal said the building complied with fire codes at
the time of its renovation. If the building were renovated today it
would be required to have sprinklers. ``Basically, it was not an
unsafe building,'' Leonard said.
   The John Sevier Partnership, which owns the building, had
planned to have a $100,000 sprinkler system installed in the
spring, said Grant Trivett of M&amp;M Properties, which manages the
building.
   ``We didn't feel uncomfortable with the safety of the building.
We just had seen fires, basically on TV and other places. The
comment was made that the sprinkler system would have been a
benefit ...,'' Trivett said Monday night.
   ``If it's renovated, it will be renovated to today's codes. You
know, it would be a shame to not utilize the building in the
future,'' Trivett said.
   In October, a resident died in a fire in the building when a
kerosene heater, apparently mistakenly filled with gasoline,
ignited his apartment.
   Two of the victims Sunday were people who had been visiting
residents when the fire alarms sounded at 5:11 p.m. In all, nearly
150 people lived in the building.
   As many as 250 firefighters fought the fire, which was brought
under control by midnight.
   Fire Chief Doug Buckles said the fire was believed to have begun
on the first or second story, but the deaths occurred on the higher
floors, probably because of the smoke.
   ``We began hearing fire alarms go off, but they were not loud
enough that we realized what it was,'' said Ben Peterson, who was
visiting his grandmother on the fourth floor. ``By the time we
finally realized what it was and went into the hall, it was full of
smoke.''
   ``It was terrible last night. It was a terrible ordeal,'' said
Samuel E. Williams, 52.
   ``I'm like other people, I'd like to know what caused that fire
because it was so fast. It was just like that,'' Williams said,
snapping his fingers. He said he escaped from his third-floor
apartment through billowing smoke.
   ``What really got to me, after we were out on the street and
looking up,'' he said, ``we saw people laying out their windows,
saying, `Help me!' And we couldn't help them.''

<HEAD>Bush Using `Tough Terms' in Negotiations with Vatican About Noriega</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 2nd graf with 1 graf to include definition of `Mexican
standoff'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

   The Bush administration demanded ``in
extraordinarily tough terms'' Monday that Vatican authorities turn
deposed Panamanian dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega over to U.S.
custody, a State Department source said.
   Negotiations have brought ``a Mexican standoff'' _ a
confrontation that neither side can win _ the official said, with
church authorities rebuffing the request and trying, thus far
unsuccessfully, to find a country to take Noriega from his
sanctuary in the Vatican Embassy in Panama City.
   While the negotiations went on, President Bush summoned National
Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft to his mountain retreat Christmas
Day to discuss diplomatic options for dislodging Noriega to bring
him to trial on drug charges in the United States.
   And speaking in Panama, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said he
would like to bring U.S. troops home ``as soon as possible'' but
added, ``They will stay as long as they are needed. We don't want
to leave too soon before the task is accomplished.''
   Roughly 26,000 U.S. troops are in Panama, more than double the
12,000 normally based there.
   The State Department source, speaking only on condition he not
be named, said the U.S. demand for custody of Noriega has been
delivered to the Vatican ``in extraordinarily tough terms.''
   But he said the Vatican has been contacting a number of Latin
American and European countries hoping that one will agree to
accept Noriega. The officials didn't mention names but countries
that have surfaced as possible refuges include Spain, Cuba and the
Dominican Republic.
   ``He has no place to go yet,'' the official said. ``Nobody wants
him.''
   The official said most of the discussions have been carried out
between the State Department and church officials at the Vatican.
   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro said in Rome it was too early
to say whether he would be handed over to the United States or the
new U.S.-backed government in Panama or given passage to another
country.
   Scowcroft was asked to come to Camp David in the Catoctin
Mountains of Maryland where the president was spending a holiday
weekend with his wife, five children and 11 grandchildren. The
White House said Secretary of State James A. Baker III was keeping
in touch by telephone from Houston where he spent the holiday.
   Meanwhile, a Panamanian officer and Noriega loyalist who had
been indicted with Noriega on drug-related charges in Florida, was
escorted to Miami on Monday by U.S. drug enforcement agents, the
Justice Department said. Lt. Col. Luis del Cid, surrendered to U.S.
forces in Panama on Saturday.
   Noriega entered the Vatican Embassy on Sunday after eluding
capture by American troops in the four days since their invasion,
despite a $1 million bounty offered by the United States.
   That relieved U.S. forces in Panama from their intensive and
frustrating task of locating him, but it also set in motion a
diplomatic and legal ballet. ``Now it's up to the lawyers and the
diplomats,'' said Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, in Panama for a
brief on-site inspection.
   Sanctuary in embassies usually is granted for people seeking
political asylum, not protection from criminal prosecution.
   ``We want him in the United States to face the indictments,''
said a member of the State Department's Task Force on Panama. ``We
are exploring avenues by which this might be done,'' said the
official, who insisted on anonymity.
   Reports from Panama mentioned the possibility that Noriega wants
to go to Spain or Cuba. When U.S. officials were negotiating with
the Panamanian strongman after his indictment in this country last
year, he reportedly expressed a willingness to go into exile in
either country, but in the end did not.
   Miguel Gil, a spokesman for the Spanish government, said no
official overtures had been made by Noriega. And Foreign Minister
Francisco Fernandez Ordonez said the case was a matter to be
decided between the United States and the Vatican. Spain's national
news agency, EFE, later reported him as saying, ``Spain is not the
ideal country to accept Noriega because of its extradition
agreement with the United States, which includes drug trafficking
(cases).''
   In Vatican City, spokesman Joaquin Navarro said ``the concerned
parties'' would examine the case as soon as possible and that
Noriega's legal status was still being determined.
   Navarro was asked in a television interview if a ``simple''
turnover of Noriega to the United States was foreseeable.
   ``Well, I don't think so,'' said Navarro. ``There isn't an
extradition treaty or anything.''
   The Pentagon issued new casualty figures in Panama. The death
toll of U.S. troops stood at 23, revised downward by one from
Sunday because one victim was counted by two different units.
   There were 303 U.S. wounded, none missing and two dependents
killed, Lundquist said.
   He said Noriega's routed Panamanian Defense Forces suffered 290
dead, 121 wounded, and 3,780 captured or detained.

   Disgraced former President Chun
Doo-hwan will testify before parliament on corruption, human rights
abuses and misconduct during his 7-year rule before the year ends,
the governing party said Tuesday.
   South Korean politics have been dogged by public demands to
clear the legacies of Chun's authoritarian rule so the way could be
cleared for a more open government and more democratic reforms.
   The Democratic Justice Party said Chun received a summons to
testify in the National Assembly Dec. 31, along with a 123-page
document listing questions the legislators wanted answered.
   Details of the procedure were still being discussed, a party
spokesman said.
   Chun left office in February 1988 after turning over power to
his former associate Roh Tae-woo, named president in national
voting two months earlier.
   Chun's predecessor, Choi Kyu-hah, also was expected to testify
before the assembly.
   Choi served briefly as a figurehead president in late 1979. He
was succeeded by Chun, who seized power in an internal army coup.
   Roh and the three main opposition leaders agreed on Dec. 15 on
resolving disputes over Chun's administration.
   Such compromise is rare in Korean politics, but political
leaders have been under mounting public pressure to agree on the
Chun-related issues in a bid to make a new start in 1990.
   Forty-eight people, including about a dozen Chun relatives, have
been convicted of corruption and power abuse.
   Chun went into rural exile in November 1988 after apologizing to
the nation for misrule and misconduct and surrendering $24 million
in unused political funds.
   Amopng the questions Chun was expected to answer were those
about his alleged role in using the military to quell a civil
uprising in Kwangju in 1980. By official count 200 people were
killed and more than 1,500 injured in the uprising.
   Radicals and dissidents have staged violent protests to demand
that Chun be arrested and punished. The main opposition parties
have publicly promised not to raise more Chun-related issues once
their demands are met. Dissidents have denounced the agreement as a
sellout.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran's former president, Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, said
Monday he believes Iranian secret service agents are holding
British hostage Terry Waite, either in Lebanon or Iran.
   Bani-Sadr, who was the Islamic Republic's first president but
has lived in exile in France since 1981, said in an interview that
friends in Iran told him Waite had been ``in a safe place, in
security for several months in the hands of the Iranian secret
services.''
   He said he believed this could be a sign that negotiations for
release of Waite and other Western hostages seized in Lebanon could
be making progress.
   Waite, 50, the special envoy of Archbishop of Canterbury Robert
Runcie, disappeared in Beirut on Jan. 20, 1987, while on a mission
to try to free Western hostages.
   No group has claimed to hold him, but he is widely believed to
be held by Islamic Jihad.
   Waite is one of 18 Western hostages in Lebanon. Longest held is
American Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press, who was abducted March 16, 1985.

   U.S. troops and armored vehicles
ringed the Vatican Embassy early today after deposed strongman Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega escaped a massive search, took refuge and
asked for asylum.
   About 40 soldiers kept watch in the pre-dawn darkness as a
Blackhawk helicopter, its running lights turned off, landed several
times across the street from the embassy, then took off.
   A reporter said he did not see the chopper pick up or discharge
anyone.
   An official at the Vatican said the nunciature could try to turn
Noriega over to the new government or arrange for safe passage to
another country but not put him in the hands of the United States,
where he faces drug trafficking charges.

   The hunt for Manuel Antonio Noriega is over,
but President Bush still is searching for ways to bring the
ex-Panamanian dictator to justice even though he is now closeted in
the Vatican ambassador's home, a White House spokesman says.
   Bush learned at Camp David late Sunday afternoon, shortly after
returning from a Pentagon briefing, that Noriega had surfaced
seeking asylum at the residence of the papal nuncio in Panama City
after five days on the run.
   The first reaction from White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
was that Noriega's ``reign of terror is over.''
   But drug-trafficking indictments still hang over Noriega's head,
and U.S. authorities are weighing options for dealing with the
fugitive ex-dictator.

   The provisional government appealed
for a cease-fire by pro-Ceausescu forces who killed thousands in
vicious weekend street battles, and Christmas carols rang out for
the first time in 42 years.
   There were reports that as many as 80,000 people died and
300,000 were wounded since the popular revolt that ousted Communist
President Nicolae Ceausescu began Dec. 15.
   Hungary's Budapest Radio and the British Broadcasting Corp.
reported the same figures Sunday night, quoting ``authoritative
sources in Bucharest,'' but giving no details.
   The reports, like others on casualties, was impossible to verify
independently. But if accurate, the Romanian uprising would be the
bloodiest anti-Communist revolt ever, its death toll far eclipsing
that of the Hungarian revolution of 1956, in which about 30,000
people are believed to have lost their lives.

and searched for 11 people missing from a fire that swept through a
high-rise retirement home.
   The Christmas Eve fire injured 51 people, including about 25
firefighters, authorities said.
   About 145 people were living at the John Sevier Retirement

   A huge fire continued today at the
nation's second largest petrochemical refinery after an explosion
ignited storage tanks holding millions of gallons of oil and
lubricants, killing one worker.
   A 4-square-mile area around the refinery, including a section of
Interstate 110, remained closed today.
   The blast shattered windows up to six miles away and was felt up
to 15 miles away. The fire sent a plume of thick, black smoke 500
feet into the air. Flames engulfed eight storage tanks holding more
than 4 million gallons of oil and lubricants, and two separator
units, which remove water from oil, officials said.
   It was believed ignited by a gas release, but what caused the
release was under investigation, said plant Manager Ed Galante.

   Ousted President Nicolae Ceausescu and
his wife were executed Monday after a secret military trial that
found them guilty of genocide and ``grave crimes'' against Romania,
Bucharest Radio reported.
   Ceausescu, the last hard-line Communist leader in the Warsaw
Pact, was chased from power Friday after his dreaded security
forces massacred thousands protesting his repressive 24-year rule
and harsh economic policies.
   The radio also blamed the Ceausescus for the deaths of more than
60,000 Romanians and said they plundered the poor country of more
than $1 billion that they deposited in foreign banks. The report
did not make clear whether the deaths occurred during the 11-day
uprising that toppled Ceausescu or during his entire tenure.
   Ceausescu, 71, and his wife, Elena, who served as a virtual
second-in-command, were executed after a trial at an undisclosed
location. Executions usually are carried out by firing squad in
Romania.
   ``Oh, what wonderful news!'' an unidentified announcer said on
the radio, which is controlled by the provisional government, the
National Salvation Committee.

   Romania's revolution against Communism,
unlike others in Eastern Europe, has exploded in volatile emotions
and violence against the repression enforced by the 24-year
dictatorship of Nicolae Ceausescu.
   Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, were reported to be executed on
Monday after a secret trial on charges of particularly grave crimes
against the people.
   No other East European country revolting in the name of
democracy has reacted in this way. But no other East European
country had a Ceausescu, whose unparalleled personality cult
trumpeted his ``golden era'' while imposing more and more hardship.
   As mandated debt repayment and industrialization programs
brought hardship to every Romanian, dissent was largely repressed
by his dreaded Securitate, a massive network of at least 700,000
people.
   Workers who dared to protest disappeared mysteriously.
Intellectuals, with a higher profile in society, faced prison,
mental hospital, internal exile or house arrest.

   U.S. troops kept a vigil on the
Vatican Embassy where Gen. Antonio Manuel Noriega sought asylum as
officials debated what to do with the man who once ran this country.
   Dozens of U.S. soldiers, armored vehicles and helicopters
encircled the embassy after Noriega turned himself in Sunday, five
days after the U.S. invasion overthrew his government, blasted his
headquarters and drove him into hiding.
   Panamanians living in refugee camps and Americans on patrol
found something to celebrate. Near Santo Tomas Hospital,
infantrymen put up a tiny Christmas tree at their post and a sign
saying ``Feliz Navidad,'' merry Christmas. They shared their food
with people from the neighborhood.
   President Guillermo Endara, the U.S.-backed leader who took
power minutes after the U.S. invasion, visited refugees during a
Christmas Mass at a camp in a soccer stadium. Endara refused to
comment on Noriega's status, saying, ``It is a very delicate
diplomatic matter with the papal state.''

   Manuel Antonio Noriega's decision to seek
asylum at the Vatican's embassy in Panama City forces President
Bush into the thicket of diplomacy and international law in pursuit
of his goal of bringing the deposed dictator to trial on drug
trafficking charges.
   ``Now it's up to the lawyers and the diplomats,'' summed up
Pentagon chief Dick Cheney, whose troops tried but failed to
capture the elusive dictator in more than four days of searching.
   When Noriega drove up to the Vatican embassy in Panama City on
Christmas Eve, Bush accomplished a central goal of the invasion he
ordered last week: removing the indicted drug trafficker from all
power in Panama.
   But how Bush, Panama's U.S.-backed government, the Vatican and
other nations handle the next step could determine not only
Noriega's fate, but the future of the strategically placed isthmus
for years to come.
   U.S. interests appear to be best served by Noriega's speedy
removal from the Papal Nunciature, where he is protected by
diplomatic immunity and by the spotlight of international
attention. As long as he stays, attention could be diverted from
U.S. efforts to restore order to the devastated country.
   The White House said Sunday it still hopes to bring Noriega to
justice. He was indicted in Florida on federal charges in 1988.

   Manuel Blanco rummaged through the
ashes that had been his home and salvaged a balpeen hammer with a
charred handle and a blackened pair of pliers.
   The two tools and the clothes on his back are what remains of
his earthly possessions. Even so, the 70-year-old retired auto
mechanic says he is glad U.S. forces invaded Panama and overthrew
the dictatorship of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   ``It hurts that I've lost everything, but what are you going to
do? The gringos had to do it like they did. I only wish they would
have done it long ago,'' he said.
   He stood on blackened sheets of corrugated zinc that had been
the roof of the two-story wooden apartment building, where he lived
with his wife and their granddaughter. The only remnants of the
building are two masonry columns that supported the communal
bathrooms.
   Blanco and his neighbors had the misfortune to live a block from
the headquarters of the Panamanian Defense Forces, Noriega's
command center.

   Millions of Eastern Europeans celebrated their first free
Christmas in four decades: Political prisoners rejoined their
families, East Germans and Czechoslovaks watched Mass on TV, and
Romanians listened to carols long-banned on state radio.
   Pope John Paul II prayed for Romanians ``celebrating this
Christmas in fear and trembling,'' mourned the thousands killed
overthrowing their Communist leaders, and praised the democratic
reforms remaking his native Eastern Europe.
   The Soviet Union's Baltic republics enjoyed the first official
Christmas holiday allowed by the Communists.
   Panamanians and U.S. soldiers spent Christmas on the lookout for
snipers.
   Church bells pealed across Czechoslovakia to mark the new
freedoms won in a pro-democracy movement that toppled Communist
leaders, created a free press and brought promises of free
elections.
   ``I feel like this is a miracle,'' said Ivan Martin Jirous, who
was reunited with his family after being released from prison one
month ago.
   On Prague's 15th century Charles Bridge, young carolers sang
haunting, traditional Christmas melodies. In previous years, police
chased carolers from the broad, cobbled King's Road.

   To effervesce, Mr. Webster says, is to ``bubble and hiss.'' If

   There's still doubt whether
President F.W. de Klerk will personally oversee the end of
apartheid, but his performance since his inauguration has raised
hopes higher than ever for peaceful change.
   Even the white-run government's most militant opponents
acknowledge a dramatic shift in mood since P.W. Botha quit the
presidency. They say de Klerk's conciliatory moves resulted from
pressure rather than conviction, but many anti-apartheid leaders
now believe _ for the first time _ that the government sincerely
wants to negotiate with them.
   ``Exit a president named P.W., to be replaced by one named F.W.
Remarkable what a difference that one letter made,'' wrote The
Weekly Mail, an anti-apartheid newspaper, in its year-end issue.
   ``Suddenly the logjam seemed to break. Good intentions twinkled
around the country. ... For the first time, people of widely
differing views agreed: there is hope in our land.''

   A Christmas Eve fire that killed 16
and injured dozens at a high-rise retirement home might have been
worse if so many people hadn't been away for the holiday,
authorities said Monday.
   Officials accounted for 10 of 11 residents who had been listed
as missing after the blaze at the 11-story John Sevier Retirement
Center. The 11th person is also believed to have been away at the
time, they said.
   ``I can't think of a worse time, on Christmas Eve,'' said P.C.
Snapp, mayor of this town of 40,000. ``On the other hand, it could
have been a good time because a number of people had gone to visit
relatives.''
   The blaze surged through the lower floors of the brick building,
sending thick smoke to the floors above. Residents of upper floors
waved flashlights and screamed for help from the windows of their
smoke-filled apartments.
   About 50 people were injured, including about 15 firefighters,
some of whom also suffered frostbite. Most were treated for smoke
inhalation and released. At least one person was seriously burned,
said Dan Blevins, spokesman for Northside Hospital.

   Some advertisers promoting vacation spots
hundreds of miles from Wyoming have the power to move mountains.
   The picturesque Grand Teton and its sister mountains have been
used in ads for Amtrak, which doesn't run through Wyoming; and such
places as a resort in Montana and even a condominium in the heart
of the Rockies in Colorado.
   For the record, the Tetons have been standing firm in
northwestern Wyoming for eons.
   And while imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, the
Jackson Hole Chamber of Commerce isn't happy to see the craggy
peaks plastered on brochures touting destinations that don't have a
view of the range even on a clear day.
   ``The Tetons are one of the most recognizable mountain ranges in
the world and we are more than a little miffed that our competitors
continue to use our assets to promote their areas,'' said Carol
Waller, the chamber's director of marketing. ``We are seriously
considering trademarking the Tetons _ I'm only half-joking.''
   While managers of those out-of-sight resorts responded with
shock or embarrassment when queried about their use of the Tetons,
none offered any apologies. Not even resort managers in Colorado,
which boasts of being home to the greatest skiing in the world.

<HEAD>Credibility Gap Looms Due to Bush Administration Gestures Toward
China</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>

   The ingredients of a credibility gap are
showing in the tortuous White House explanations of administration
missions and gestures toward China, a private easing of publicly
declared sanctions. It is an account heavy with fine print and fine
distinctions as President Bush and his spokesmen argue that
Americans were not misled by secret diplomacy.
   Administrations that offered hairsplitting definitions in
defense of their actions have had trouble before. Lyndon B.
Johnson's credibility problems began when he shaded meanings to
create impressions that would build support for his policies.
   The controversy over the Bush administration's secret and
secretive China overtures is not ended, only on hold because of
U.S. intervention in Panama. It will be revived, with an effort to
override a Bush veto of a bill extending visas for Chinese students
due soon after Congress reconvenes Jan. 23.
   The administration's sanctions were imposed June 20, after the
massacre in Tiananmen Square that began China's repression of
democracy demonstrators. Bush was said to have suspended ``all
high-level exchanges of government officials'' while halting
military exchanges and postponing international loans to Beijing.
   But within two weeks of that decree, Bush secretly sent two top
officials to Beijing on a mission disclosed Dec. 18 after it had
been reported by Cable News Network. The same two men, Brent
Scowcroft, the national security adviser, and Lawrence S.
Eagleburger, the deputy secretary of state, went to China on Dec. 2
and 3; that trip was announced at 2 o'clock on a Saturday morning,
after they had arrived. Bush's spokesman said the Chinese wanted it
done that way.
   The second trip had stirred sharp criticism from congressional
Democrats who said the Chinese hadn't done anything to warrant an
easing of the sanctions, which some critics had said were too tame
in the first place.
   Bush said he ordered those contacts with China because improved
relations serve U.S. interests, and because a nation of more than 1
billion people should not be isolated.
   The initial, secret trip came to light a day after the
administration sent Eagleburger to brief a top congressional
Democrat on the December mission to Beijing _ while withholding
word of the one in July. Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine, said he was astonished to learn of the July mission. The
White House said Bush sent Scowcroft on that one to tell the
Chinese of his shock and concern at the Tiananmen killings.
   Bush by then had ordered the sanctions. He and Scowcroft had
confronted the Chinese ambassador with the same message at a White
House meeting.
   Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Scowcroft was sent to
Beijing ``to make sure that the Chinese did not think this was just
a public statement.''
   He said Bush considered it important that the July contact be
kept secret from Congress as well as from the public. To the
suggestion that the Scowcroft message might have been reinforced
had Congress been advised and joined in the reproof, Fitzwater
replied:
   ``It might carry more weight in the American way of thinking,
but not in the China way of thinking.''
   And Bush on Thursday said people should pay close attention to
the words he uses, insisting that he never precluded high-level
contacts with the Chinese. ``I said `no high-level exchanges,''' he
clarified. ``So please look at it carefully.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III wasn't careful enough _ he
said in a Dec. 10 television interview that the latest
Scowcroft-Eagleburger visit was ``the first time we've had
high-level U.S. officials go to the People's Republic of China''
since the sanctions. After the secret trip was disclosed, the State
Department said Baker ``regrets that he may have misled'' some
people.
   There was a further easing of the sanctions Dec. 19, when Bush
lifted a ban on loans that promote U.S. business in China, and
approved the export of three communications satellites that are to
be launched into orbit by the Chinese.
   Bush insisted Thursday that his policies were the right ones.
``I know how China works,'' he said, ``see what we can do, make a
representation of how strongly we feel against human rights abuse,
but see what it's going to take to go forward.''
   He also has said that reciprocal Chinese actions would silence
some of his critics. ``I notice now that some of the critics who
were so opposed, using this fantastically, diabolically anti-me
language, they come up now and say well, if you get A, B and C,
then it would be all right.''
   That may be so. But the Chinese haven't offered any of the above.
   On Thursday, Beijing condemned the U.S. move into Panama as a
shocking violation of international law and demanded immediate
withdrawal.
