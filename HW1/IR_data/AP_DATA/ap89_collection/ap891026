   South Africa has test-fired an
intermediate-range ballistic missile that couldcarry nuclear
warheads and was built with help from Israel, a U.S. official said
Thursday.
   Israel and South Africa are also cooperating in the development
of a long-range missile that could be used to launch reconnaissance
satellites into space, said the official, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity.
   Responding to reports about the nuclear cooperation, the State
Department urged Israel to sign the international Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty, which it has refused to do for fear of
opening its facilities to international inspection.
   ``We have repeatedly urged Israel and other non-signatories'' to
join in the pact, said a statement issued late Thursday. ``We
reiterate that call.''
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir denied Thursday that his
government had provided South Africa with the technology for a
nuclear-capable missile. South Africa's foreign minister, Pik
Botha, said, ``I bear no knowledge whatsoever of such cooperation.''
   Israel's Defense Ministry spokesman, Eitan Haber, said his
country is adhering to a 1987 decision that no new defense
contracts between Israel and South Africa be signed. But Israel
also has said existing contracts would be honored.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We don't
have any direct knowledge that we can comment on at this time ...
We are looking into it.''
   The State Department and the Pentagon refused to discuss the
matter. ``We do not comment on intelligence matters. The U.S.
policy of opposition to the proliferation of missiles and nuclear
weapons is well known,'' said State Department spokeswoman Margaret
Tutwiler.
   ``Our ambassador in Israel has discussed similar reports in the
overall question of proliferation on a number of occasions with
Israel's Ministry of Defense,'' she said.
   The U.S. official said intelligence reports said South Africa
last summer tested a modified version of the Israeli-made Jericho
II medium-range missile at Armaston, on the Indian Ocean coast near
Capetown.
   The Washington Post, citing unidentified ``informed official,''
said in Friday editions the U.S. ambassador was ``stiffed'' and
told ``it was none of our business'' when he raised the missile
issue in January.
   NBC-TV, citing unidentified intelligence sources and a CIA
document, reported Wednesday that South Africa was providing
Israel, in return, with enriched uranium for its own nuclear
warheads. Neither country has admitted to having nuclear weapons.
   The South African missile, test-fired over the Indian Ocean,
flew 900 miles, its maximum range, said the official.
   Israel test-fired its own Jericho II missile about 500 miles
over the Mediterranean last year, he said.
   A long-range version of the Jericho, known as the Shavit _
Hebrew for comet _ was used to launch an Israeli
photo-reconnaissance satellite earlier this year from a site in the
Negev Desert, the official said. Press reports at the time
described the rocket as a multi-stage missile having a 2,000-mile
range.
   NBC identified South Africa's long-range test site as Overberg,
saying Israeli experts would be given a chance to monitor testing
at that site.

   A bomb Thursday destroyed a bus full of
police officers in Medellin, killing at least five policemen and
injuring 15, authorities said.
   The radio station RCN without identifying its sources said 66
pounds of dynamite exploded beneath the bus as it crossed a street
in the Bello Horizonte suburb of Medellin, hub for the major drug
cartel in Colombia. The report said the bus, which struck a taxi
after the bomb went off, was reduced to rubble.
   Police said the bus was carrying police officers to various
sites of the city to help in the government's war against drug
traffickers. Police and official sources said five were killed
instantly and that most of the injured were in serious condition at
local clinics.
   The mayor of Medellin, Juan Gomez Martinez, said earlier
Thursday that he opposed a government dialogue with drug
traffickers, which some hope will restore peace to the country.
Since mid-August, there have been 225 bombings and bomb attempts,
leaving 31 dead and 218 injured.
   The latest injury was late Thursday, when a bomb tossed from a
passing car went off at the central telephone exchange in southern
Bogota, injuring one person, police said.
   Earlier Thursday, unidentified assailants in a taxi opened fire
and killed two police officers assigned to guard the Ecuadoran
consulate in Medellin, authorities said.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for either
incident but a series of bombings and assassinations that have
swept this country since the government declared war on traffickers
nearly 10 weeks ago have been blamed on hitmen hired by the drug
barons.
   The attacks came a day after the country suffered its worst
rebel violence in two years, with guerrillas storming two
northeastern towns and slaying at least six people, according to
army reports.
   The army blamed Wednesday's attacks on the National Liberation
Army, a shadowy pro-Cuban organization.
   There were no known links between the attacks Wednesday and
Thursday and the government's war with drug traffickers. However,
the army has claimed for years, without producing proof, that some
leftist guerrillas and drug traffickers work in tandem.
   In the attack on the guards in Medellin, assailants traveling in
a taxi opened fire on the police in front of the consulate
downtown, a Medellin police spokesman told The Associated Press by
telephone.
   One guard was immediately killed while the other died later at a
nearby clinic, the spokesman said.
   The spokesman said authorities were investigating whether the
killings were carried out by terrorists.
   The national radio network Caracol quoted witnesses as saying
the two guards were attacked when they went to the aid of another
policeman attempting to make an arrest.
   Medellin, a city of 2 million residents, is the most well-known
city of those making up Colombia's cartels. Others include cartels
in Cali, on the north coast of Colombia and in Bogota.
   The government pressed ahead with the drug war Wednesday,
notifying an purported member of the Medellin cocaine cartel he was
being extradited to the United States.
   According to TV Hoy, the government told Jose Rafael Abello
Silva, 34, that he would be extradited.
   Police have said Abello is the fourth most important figure in
the cartel, in charge of its activities on Colombia's Atlantic
coast.
   Abello, also known by his nickname ``The Monkey,'' was arrested
Oct. 10 in Bogota and faces a charge by an Oklahoma federal court
of conspiracy to distribute cocaine.
   Under President Virgilio Barco's extradition decree, Abello has
five days to appeal the extradition.
   The government has extradited four suspected drug traffickers to
the United States since it launched its crackdown on Aug. 19 after
the assassination of opposition presidential candidate Sen. Luis
Carlos Galan.
   Suspected traffickers have responded to the crackdown with a
series of bombings and assassinations.
   In Wednesday's rebel raids, about 100 guerrillas invaded Cachira
and La Vega, towns in the state of Norte de Santander, the army's
2nd division reported.
   The heaviest attack, by about 60 men and women, was in Cachira,
a town of 15,000 people about 250 miles northeast of Bogota. The
guerrillas destroyed a police station with mortar shells and fired
on police officers with automatic weapons.
   Two policemen were killed and seven injured during five hours of
fighting, an army communique said.
   An hour after that assault began, 40 rebels invaded La Vega, 15
miles away, and tried to overrun the police station there. Two
policemen were wounded in the seven-hour battle, the reports said.
   One guerrilla died as the attackers fled the town of 5,000
people into the mountains, the army communique said.
   Guerrillas also ambushed police sent in as reinforcements. Three
officers died in an attack along a dirt road outside town.
   The rebel attacks were the bloodiest since 1987, when more than
50 people were killed during one month of fighting.
   Caracol said two other leftist groups, the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia and the People's Liberation Army, also
participated in Wednesday's attacks. The army could not confirm the
report.

<HEAD>`Today' Co-host Jane Pauley Set to Announce Departure Friday</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   NBC ``Today'' show co-host Jane Pauley planned
to announce on the air Friday morning that she's leaving the show,
ending more than a month of speculation, network sources said
Thursday night.
   Pauley, whose job with co-host Bryant Gumbel will be taken by
Deborah Norville, will leave at the end of the year and anchor a
prime-time news series some time next year, a source close to the
program said.
   Norville was made news anchor of the two-hour, top-rated morning
program on Sept. 5. Norville's successor as news anchor at the
earlier ``NBC News at Sunrise'' has yet to be selected, the source
said.
   For Pauley, 39, the move will end a 13-year run of the show that
began in 1975 when she came here from NBC-owned WMAQ-TV in Chicago
to succeed Barbara Walters, when Walter left to join ABC News.
   Pauley was reportedly unhappy about changes that have been made
on the show, including the shift of former ``Today'' news anchor
John Palmer to Norville's previous job. Pauley has refused
previously to comment about her impending move.
   She has said, however, that she would be staying at NBC News,
where her contract still has two years to run.
   Her plans to leave were confirmed in an interview Wednesday with
``Today'' weatherman Willard Scott.
   NBC planned to announce when she'd leave last Friday, a source
close to the situation said, but postponed that when ``Today'' was
hurriedly sent to San Francisco Tuesday night to help cover the
killer earthquake there.
   Pauley's reported discontent over changes in the show focused in
part on the addition of two layers of new management by the end of
the year.
   NBC Sports President Dick Ebersol this summer was given a second
job as NBC News vice president for ``Today.'' Starting next year, a
newly created position of senior executive producer is to be filled
by David Nuell, now executive producer of the syndicated
``Entertainment Tonight'' series.
   The future status of the current ``Today'' executive producer,
Marty Ryan, is not yet known.

<TEXT>
   Aftershocks usually happen within months
after a main earthquake and on the same section of fault, but they
can occur a century later and on nearby faults, an expert said
Wednesday.
   ``Earthquakes cluster into sequences. By definition, we call the
biggest one the main shock. Any that happen before the biggest one
are foreshocks, and any that come after the biggest one are
aftershocks,'' said seismologist Lucile Jones of the U.S.
Geological Survey in Pasadena.
   By Wednesday morning, more than 4,000 aftershocks rattled the
same 30-mile-long section of the San Andreas Fault that caused the
magnitude-7.1 major earthquake that rocked the San Francisco Bay
Area on Oct. 17, according to the USGS in Menlo Park.
   Aftershocks generally become less powerful and less frequent
over time, the agency said.
   Based on statistical studies of past California quakes by Jones
and Paul Reasenberg, the USGS on Tuesday said that within two
months, there is about a 10 percent chance of a strong aftershock
measuring 6 or larger on the Richter scale.
   During the same period, there is a 45 percent chance of an
aftershock of magnitude 5.0 or larger, the agency said.
   When a fault breaks to cause an earthquake, there is a change in
underground stress patterns, resulting in aftershocks that tend to
occur along the same segment of fault, Jones said. But the stress
changes mean aftershocks also can occur on the fault slightly
beyond the segment that first broke, or on other, nearby faults,
she added.
   Aftershocks from a major quake like the Oct. 17 jolt ``could be
over in a year, or it could take 10 years,'' she said.
   And a great quake, estimated at magnitude 8, rocked Japan in
1890 ``and we are still having aftershocks from that earthquake''
almost 100 years later, Jones said.
   The quakes are considered aftershocks because ``there are still
more earthquakes there than before that mainshock happened. It's
still more than the background rate,'' she explained.
   Aside from aftershocks, quakes sometimes can trigger other
quakes on adjacent segments of the same fault ``like zipper action
up a fault,'' she said.
   In its Tuesday statement, the USGS said there is a ``very small,
but not zero'' chance that the Oct. 17 quake could be followed by
an even larger jolt on the segment of the San Andreas just north of
the segment that already broke.

   Be it ever so humble or earthquake-rumpled,
there's no place like home for Lucille Penn and hundreds of other
displaced senior citizens.
   Ms. Penn, 70, slept two nights in her car and three nights in a
Red Cross shelter before one of the city's swankiest hotels gave
her a free home this week. But her heart is still at her home.
   ``I don't want to be a guest somewhere. Your home is your
identity,'' said Ms. Penn. ``When you're up in years, anything else
looks like too much effort at this point in the game. What else do
you care about?''
   Ms. Penn, who lives alone, is staying in one of 25 rooms donated
to the Red Cross by the Stanford Court Hotel, which threw in
complimentary breakfast and dinner and free local phone calls for
their shaken guests. Rooms normally cost $180 to $300.
   Ms. Penn is unsure how long repairs will take to her apartment
in the hard-hit Marina district, which overlooks San Francisco Bay.
   ``You take it one day at a time. No, you take it one hour at a
time,'' said Ms. Penn, who for five days wore a T-shirt that said:
``(Crap) happens ... and so do miracles.''
   Providing for the special needs of the elderly is one of the
city's most demanding tasks in the recovery from a killer
earthquake last week.
   About 1,300 residents of the Marina are senior citizens, and
some have adamantly refused to budge, even if their homes are
unsafe or without gas and electricity.
   Off-duty firefighters and other volunteers in vans have handed
out bottled water, hot meals and cold sandwiches. They also deliver
mail and presciption medicine, or ferry residents to locations
where they can take a shower.
   ``They'll survive this. They just don't want to survive it
outside their homes. It's a lifetime of memories,'' said Kevin
Shelley, who is coordinating city programs for the elderly from a
shelter.
   Retired school teacher Myrna Croce, 80, elected to stick it out
at home with her sister. Their home wasn't damaged, but they had no
utilities for days and are still without electricity.
   ``They'd have to drag us out of here. Maybe we're nuts. Maybe
we're peculiar,'' Mrs. Croce said. ``We're just two old ladies with
dirty feet, dirty hair, dirty teeth.''
   ``Where are we going to go? I've been in my house 39 years. Our
lives are here,'' said neighbor Barbara Osario, 60.
   Across the street, Frederick Giorgone, 74, said he stayed
because he was afraid of looters. With no power to cook, he lived
on bottled water, fruit and cold coffee.
   ``It's my home. If it falls down with another earthquake, I'm
going with it. I'll go down with the ship,'' Giorgone said. ``We
fought tooth and nail to stay here. They would have to take me out
in handcuffs.''
   A few of the elderly hid in their homes without knowing if the
buildings were safe. An 89-year-old woman, who was found huddled
behind her door, was one of several people removed by inspectors
checking buildings for stability.
   ``The firemen heard a creak and kicked down the door and found
her,'' Shelley said.

   Yves Saint Laurent threw caution to the wind and
brought out the sexiest clothes in Paris in his ready-to-wear for
summer show.
   Thus ended a week of revealing, curvy, feminine clothes.
   Saint Laurent on Wednesday left fashion-watchers panting in the
steamy tent with the hot cuts and colors.
   The king of chic looked more at ease than in many a season. He
took a bow after the show, surrounded by his models wearing draped,
thigh-split skirts, bodices revealing bosoms, and flirtatious
Carmen Miranda dresses that left no doubt that sex is in, and even
chic.
   After a tentative beginning of laced khaki poplin safari
miniskirts and bush jackets worn with thigh boots and towering
turban wraps, Saint Laurent took off in a show that combined
elegance and daring.
   It was both subtle and versatile. For those with a figure
problem, he brought out some loose smock dresses in hot-weather
cottons, most original with flowered appliques on the huge puff
sleeves and yokes.
   Those who looked beyond the sexy clothes could find old favorite
classics: good sailors' blousons, a superb tomato red jersey shift,
swingy ochre short coats or trenches with dark, lean skirts and
belted tunics.
   But the come-hither message was clear. Even trouser suits had
daringly low-cut jackets, the bosom more evident than the shapely
shoulders, jacket lapels often cut way down in this softly sexy
collection to make way for the prominent female curves.
   A flowered, fitted white pique jacket with a sweetheart neckline
topping cropped wide pants was as gay as a spring morning.
   For extra flower power, he plastered big red poppies diagonally
on bodices and skirts of fitted short suits.
   The dark silk and linen suits with mother-of-pearl pastille
buttons up sleeves and jackets were cut curvily with tulip-shaped
long jackets, and beautifully draped skirts were often
asymmetrically wrapped to give an even more titillating leg show.
   Saint Laurent went to town with the polka-dotted flounced Carmen
Miranda minis and flamenco dresses, short in front, dipped in back.
   There's no doubt that when Saint Laurent goes overboard, he does
it with class. The gaucho girls in leather outfits overloaded with
multicolored cabochon-glass decor and sequins on boleros had a
certain cachet, though the costumes would be hard to wear anywhere
except to a psychedelic Dallas barbecue.
   For torso emphasis, Saint Laurent would wrap the body in tight
taffeta draping, with a tiny shocking pink leather bolero on top, a
lean violet shiny leather skirt below.
   Temperatures went down somewhat as Saint Laurent relaxed to show
some modest draped crepe dinner dresses, and just one classic
satin-lapelled black dinner suit.
   But the dinner suit turned into a black crepe and satin harem
tuxedo, the midriff bare to below the navel, the skirt and tiny
bodice cut to show every curve. It was quite pretty with an organza
coat flung over it like a transparent cloud.

   When the first rains fell in April,
Debre Medhiro Wolde-Mariam planted sorghum on his patch of sandy
land and hoped for plentiful rain and a repeat of last year's good
harvest.
   He got neither.
   All Debre, 76, had in October were dry stalks, not even suitable
to feed his bullock.
   And he wasn't alone. Eritrea, Ethiopia's northernmost province,
is dotted with patches of scorched crops, and relief workers say
the crop failure could threaten nearly 1.7 million people with
famine next year.
   ``In severity, the situation is as bad as it was in 1984-85,''
says David Morton, operations director at the U.N. World Food
Program. The 1984-85 drought and famine killed as many as 1 million
people, most of them in northern Ethiopia, despite one of Africa's
largest-ever relief operation.
   To stave off famine deaths, the agency has appealed to
international donors for 241,000 tons of emergency food to feed an
estimated 1.5 million Eritreans and 200,000 refugees from its
southern neighbor, Tigre.
   Those figures, however, do not take into account foodless
peasants living in areas now under rebel control.
   Tigre and Eritrea are home to insurgencies that have waged 15
and 28 years of war respectively against Ethiopia's government. The
Eritrean rebels are talking with President Mengistu Haile Mariam's
Marxist government and have remained quiescent behind battle lines
forged last year.
   However, the Tigrean rebels have intensfied their fight. Having
won control of their homeland, they are engaged in a successful
campaign that has brought them into the heart of Tigre's southern
neighbor, Wollo province.
   On Oct. 15, the Eritrean rebels appealed for 270,000 tons of
emergency food it said would be needed for 1.4 million people in
areas it controlled. It urged nations to send the food into the
guerrilla-held areas from across the border in Sudan, a route used
successfully in the past to feed Eritrea's hungry.
   Taken together, the rebel and and U.N. figures would indicate
nearly the whole of Eritrea's population of some 3.2 million is
threatened with famine.
   In Eritrea's capital, Asmara, 15 miles north of Adieradom,
officials say the traditional drought indicators are beginning to
appear: child malnutrition is on the rise, water is being rationed
and peasants are beginning to sell at very low prices livestock
they can't feed.
   Isaak Tsegay, the province's deputy administrator, said peasants
already were seeking relief food ``when they should be harvesting.''
   Relief officials say they have little food to distribute, with
only 10,000 tons of emergency food in stock and that is tabbed for
161,477 people displaced by the civil war and currently in need.
   The only additional supplies expected are 27,000 tons of wheat
promised by the United States, Britain and the 12-member European
Economic Community which is due before the end of the year.
   ``If we don't get more supplies by March, we will be in serious
trouble,'' Morton said.
   Farming is risky in Eritrea, a 48,000-square-mile pile of sand
and stones adjoining the Red Sea. Centuries of wind, downpours and
peasants chopping down trees for firewood have eroded the land,
leaving craggy mountains and sandy valleys.
   When the rains are adequate _ an average of 80 inches annually _
peasants survive, growing sorghum, wheat, barley, corn and other
crops in the valleys and on terraces.
   The rains were adequate last year, the first time in a decade,
Isaak says. Ironically, that's the reason Eritrea is threatened
with famine next year.
   Morton says no emergency food was needed this year because of
last year's harvest. The result is the lowest food stocks since
1985. Added to that, only about 40 inches of rain fell this year.
   Relief officials hope the world community will respond quickly
with donations.
   ``They have in the past,'' said Afwork Behane, Asmara's mayor.
``But in the long-run, the people will have to be self-sufficient
in food production.''
   That goes for the whole of Ethiopia.
   Drought strikes the Horn of Africa nation with a tragic monotony
and Ethiopia regularly has to hold out the begging bowl. Ethiopia
is one of the world's poorest nations.
   Western donors say that due to unproductive agricultural
policies, shifting weather, and a population growth of 2.9 percent
that outstrips food production, Ethiopia will suffer a yearly food
deficit of about 3 million tons for the foreseeable future.
   To try to reduce effects of drought-induced famine, the
government is expected to announce soon a disaster preparedness
program to stockpile food, improve distribution, and upgrade the
country's system of forecasting crop failures.
   Other aims are establishing seed banks and cattle camps with
fodder and water to enable peasants to plant again and to build up
herds after a drought.
   In the meantime, smallholders like Debre will continue to rely
on the good will of others during drought.
   ``I am hoping some kind person, it doesn't matter who, will
provide some food,'' said the withered peasant, standing in the
middle of his worthless crop.

<HEAD>Port of Oakland Juggles Ships After Quake</HEAD>

   Robert Middleton stood by a pavement
crack left by the earthquake along the wharf on the Port of
Oakland's Seventh Street Public Container Terminal and took a line
from a watch commercial.
   ``The Port of Oakland,'' Middleton, a port spokesman, said
Wednesday. ``It takes a licking, but keeps on ticking.''
   Officials are still toting up the damage from last week's
earthquake, but it appears the port _ the nation's fourth-largest
and the biggest in the Bay area _ suffered about $70 million worth
of damage, said James J. O'Brien, executive director of
transportation services for the port.
   Most of that can be accounted for at the Seventh Street
terminal, which also accounted for about 7 percent of the 14.7
million revenue tons of cargo that moved through the port last year.
   The terminal's three huge container cranes can't run up and down
the wharf because their tracks were knocked off level by the quake.
There is no good idea when they will be ready to go again.
   However, nine other terminals remain in operation, and port
officials have been berthing ships normally handled at Seventh
Street at other terminals so they won't have to be turned away.
   ``At the moment, we have the capacity to accommodate all our
present customers with a lot of cooperation,'' O'Brien said. ``We
are not out to bring in any new users at this point until we get
the Seventh Street facility back on line.''
   With news of the earthquake flashed around the world, the port
is working to maintain the confidence of its shippers through
representatives in Rotterdam, Hong Kong, Taipai, Tokyo, and Seoul.
   Reports of heavy congestion around Los Angeles during the 1984
Olympics caused some shippers to divert cargo to Oakland and now
Oakland hopes to escape having the tables turned, Middleton said.
   The Port of Oakland serves about 1,500 ships a year and 88
percent of the cargoes come in containers. Oakland handles 90
percent of the container cargo moving through the Golden Gate.
   Cargos headed out tend to be raw materials, agricultural goods
and partially finished goods. Cargoes coming in tend to be consumer
goods. About 90 percent of the shipping is on the Pacific Rim,
though some comes from Europe and South America.
   The same seismic forces that swayed the Bay Bridge so much that
a section of the upper deck fell also hit the 2-decade-old Seventh
Street Terminal, heaving up a big crack where the wharf, supported
by concrete pilings driven down the bedrock, meets the yard, which
rests on fill.
   The jolt shook the wharf, sheering off the row of batter piles
at the top, he said. The batter piles are a set of two diagonal
concrete pilings that come together like an A-frame. Forming a row
farthest from the water side of the wharf, they were designed to
protect the wharf from the sideways shake of an earthquake.
   When they failed, the wharf tilted, lowering the crane tracks on
the water side several inches _ enough to put the cranes out of
commission.
   The wharf will likely have to be replaced, and there is no
telling how long that will take, said Steve Kappler, civil engineer
for the port.
   But it offers a lesson to engineers on how to build a wharf to
withstand an earthquake.
   The wharf stood up at the Howard Terminal, which was built in
1980 with the benefit of more advanced understanding of earthquake
engineering, though a container crane was knocked off its tracks.

<HEAD>Hippies Culture Still Big Part of Santa Cruz</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF WILSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SANTA CRUZ, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There are still prophets of the hippie
culture sprinkled in the Santa Cruz Mountains, and the
quarter-century-old values of that communal counterculture have
emerged from quake rubble.
   This fertile region 60 miles south of San Francisco was next to
the epicenter of the Oct. 17 quake that rocked Northern California,
killing dozens, injuring thousands and causing damage that will
exceed $7.1 billion.
   Many of the mountains around the city are inaccessible because
of land and rockslides triggered by the quake. But in the city
limits, there are signs of a revitalization of the ``dropout''
philosophy of the 1960s.
   The pre-quake homeless population, estimated at 1,000, was
joined Oct. 17 by hundreds displaced by the disaster.
   On Wednesday, donations of food and clothing were being
distributed to all comers, and many quake refugees were still in
shelters.
   ``There is an awareness of self, an intelligencia. It's not a me
generation, it's a we generation,'' said Chris Watkins, who sells
handmade leather goods.
   ``People in Santa Cruz have always pulled together. They are
really in tune with each other. It is the land time forgot,''
Watkins added.
   Like the counterculture of old, there is a sizeable segment here
who resent war, racism, poverty, materialism and automation. For
the most part, though, malcontents have mellowed.
   But the wacky image persists and not entirely without
foundation. Meditative vegetarians resting on futon furniture,
soaking in hot tubs and tending organic herb gardens do exist.
   Health food stores, proponents of New Age religions,
merchandisers of healing crystals and even ``five-star'' psychic
Susie Stevens Jarvis have a foothold here. Longhairs still drive
tattered Volkswagen buses through the streets.
   ``There wasthe commune movement and the counterculture movement
in the 60s, and Santa Cruz was in the vanguard of this,'' said
local historian Page Smith, who was a founding provost at the
University of California, Santa Cruz. It is interesting to note the
UCSC nickname is the Banana Slugs.
   ``The counterculture was very evident when I came here (from Los
Angeles in 1964). The mountains were already sprinkled with
prophets of the counterculture. There certainly are more arts and
crafts people per capita here than anywhere else in the country,''
Smith said.
   ``The image of Santa Cruz as a flaky, drug-using place was not
too far off the mark,'' Smith said.
   University regional historian Randall Jarrell said the communal
life in the mountains of Santa Cruz has evolved considerably, but
adds, ``There are certainly a few relics and remnants of the
hippies. A lot have matured and I would not say we are a hippie
community as such.
   ``I would say we are progressive-minded. There is certainly an
arts and crafts population. But there aren't that many candlemakers
anymore.''
   Ms. Jarrell said Santa Cruz has a history of communal living
dating to the early 1900s when Italians pooled money and resources
in their wharf fishing endeavors.
   ``This kind of communal coming together is deep in the culture
here,'' she said. ``There is a basic feeling of tolerance here.''
   Longtime resident Joan Ward said the hippie community in Santa
Cruz has always represented only a small faction of the population.
``The old rag for 25 years has always been old hippies strumming
guitars and that sort of thing. That is totally wrong. We are
wonderfully diverse,'' Ms. Ward said.
   The diversity is obvious. After all, the seaside city of 45,000
recently held a ninth annual Brussels Sprout Festival on its famous
boardwalk. There was sprout-tossing, sprout-cutting and
sprout-cooking. The annual Cold Water Surf Classic is next on the
social agenda.

<HEAD>Lebanon Accord Opens Door to Peace, But Move Remains Fragile</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The peace accord worked out by in Taif,
Saudi Arabia, is the most serious Arab attempt to end Lebanon's 14
years of sectarian civil war, but making it work is another matter.
   Lebanese legislators and Arab League mediators, who met in the
Saudi resort for three weeks, achieved what was unthinkable a few
weeks ago in a country that has had rival Christian and Moslem
governments since September 1988.
   The plan is the first to provide a framework for political
reforms designed to share power equally between the traditionally
dominant Christians and Moslems, now an estimated 55 percent of
Lebanon's 4 million people.
   It is a fragile structure, however, because it does not resolve
the political frustrations of militia leaders on both sides, who
were not represented at Taif. The accord also lacks a concrete plan
for withdrawal of Syria's 40,000 soldiers stationed in Lebanon,
which Christians demand.
   Vagueness about withdrawal clearly leaves Syria with a role in
Lebanon, where it is the main power broker. The agreement notes,
somewhat disingenuously given Syrian control of 70 percent of the
country, that Syria ``will not permit any act that threatens
Lebanon's security, independence or sovereignty.''
   Arab and foreign pressure may force militia leaders to accept
the accord, which Lebanon's war-weary people hope will end a war
that taken more than 150,000 lives and displaced one-fourth of the
population, but there are many pitfalls.
   Deeply embedded distrust on both sides and rivalries of Syria,
Israel, Iraq, Iran and Libya played out in Lebanon could wreck the
plan as they did peace efforts in 1983, 1984 and 1985.
   ``Reaching agreement in Taif is likely to be child's play in
comparison to putting that agreement into effect in Lebanon,''
analyst Charles Snow wrote in the respected Middle East Economic
Survey.
   The Taif accord reduces the dominant role of Maronite Catholics,
the main Christian sect, in the government and Parliament and gives
Moslems more power than they have had since independence from
France in 1943.
   It envisages a government of national reconcilitiation that will
restore central authority and election of a president acceptable to
all sides.
   Nabih Berri, leader of the Shiite Moslem militia Amal, says the
agreement does not give the 1.2 million Shiites, the largest sect
in Lebanon, a share of power commensurate with their numbers.
   Walid Jumblatt, the Druse Moslem chieftain, voiced grudging
acceptance to support his Syrian allies, but clearly is far from
happy with it. The Druse, a mystical offshoot of Islam long hostile
to the Christians, form only 6 percent of the population and fear
for their survival.
   For Maronites led the army commander, Gen. Michel Aoun, the
major flaw in the agreement is its failure to be specific about
Syrian withdrawal.
   Aoun considers Syria an occupying power. Ironically, the Syrians
moved into Lebanon in April 1976 to help save the Christians from
being overwhelmed by an alliance of leftists, Moslems and
Palestinians.
   Syria feared the leftists and Palestinians would control a
radical state on its vulnerable western flank and precipitate an
Israeli invasion, which came to pass in 1982.
   Later in 1976, the Arab League conferred some legality on the
Syrian action by giving it a peacekeeping mandate.
   In the kaledeiscope of changing alliances in Lebanon, the
Syrians soon found themselves fighting the Christians. Aoun says
Syria has violated the Arab League mandate by openly siding with
the Moslems.
   In March, he began a ``war of liberation'' against the Syrians
that involved some of the most ferocious artillery battles of the
war. More than 900 people were killed and nearly 3,000 wounded,
nearly all of them civilians.
   Outgunned and outnumbered, he gambled that outside powers would
compel Syria to withdraw, but Western powers were wary of the
Lebanese quagmire and stayed aloof. Aoun was left isolated, with
little choice but to accept an Arab League cease-fire on Sept. 22.
   George Saadeh, leader of the right-wing Phalange Party, and
other Maronite legislators defied Aoun's demand that they refuse
concessions at Taif until they had guarantees of Syrian withdrawal.
   ``Aoun sees himself as a national savior, a man with a
mission,'' a Lebanese analyst said privately. ``That makes him
dangerous. He's taking on everyone in sight, but he can't stand
alone against the whole Arab world and the international
community.''
   Samir Geagea, leader of the main Christian militia, and Maronite
Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir have endorsed the Taif agreement, causing
speculation about Aoun's continued control of the Christian
government and army.
   Syria, as in the past, has linked its departure to Israeli
withdrawal from the ``security zone'' it maintains just inside
south Lebanon. Israel cites the presence of guerrillas in the area
as a security threat and shows no signs of leaving.

<HEAD>Spot Believed to be Shakespeare's Theater Open to Public</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the next two weeks William Shakespeare
devotees will be able to visit the site archaeologists believe once
held the bard's legendary Globe Theater.
   Owner Hanson PLC said Wednesday it has arranged for a
scaffolding viewing platform over the site near Southwark Bridge,
less than a mile east of the National Theater on the south bank of
the Thames.
   It will be open daily until Nov. 8.
   ``It isn't terribly exciting for anyone who doesn't know what
they are looking at. Notes will be handed out explaining what can
be seen,'' a Hanson spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   Three chalk-and-brick foundation walls that archaeologists say
were part of the back of the 17th century theater are visible in
the excavation.
   The first performances of Shakespeare's great tragedies
``Hamlet,'' ``Othello,'' ``King Lear'' and ``Macbeth'' were staged
at the Globe Theater, built in 1599 and rebuilt after a fire 14
years later.
   Most of the site later was covered by brewery buildings. The
spot believed to be that of the theater is a former brewery parking
lot.
   Hanson, a British conglomerate, acquired the site three years
ago as part of its takeover of the Imperial group, which included
the former Courage brewery company.
   Hanson has asked Environment Secretary Christopher Patten to
declare the site an ancient monument.
   Harvey Sheldon, head of the Museum of London's archaeological
unit for the capital, said he believed the remains are part of the
Globe because they are in the ``O'' shape described by Shakespeare,
and because of the discovery of large quantities of hazelnut
shells, which were the Elizabethan equivalent of popcorn.

   Police Cmdr. Gilbert Hill, who appeared as Eddie
Murphy's foul-mouthed, short-tempered boss in the ``Beverly Hills
Cop'' movies, pauses to sign autographs while he stumps for a City
Council seat.
   ``Absolutely it's helped, and I don't apologize for it,'' Hill
said of the name recognition. ``But behind the name, my community
record stands up to anybody's. I'm a longtime resident and a police
officer for 32 years.''
   He finished fourth in September's primary _ highest among
non-incumbents. Recent polls show him second among the 18
candidates for nine council seats. The top vote-getter in the Nov.
7 election will automatically be council president.
   Hill's appearances in ``Beverly Hills Cop'' stalled his police
career. In February 1986, he was moved from the Homicide Section,
which he had headed for five years, to run the department's
lesser-known Patrol Support Division. A week after the transfer, he
took a leave for ``Beverly Hills Cop II.''
   ``I'm going to retire from the police department when I win,''
Hill said Wednesday.
   Hill said he sensed jealously from people in Detroit after his
face appeared on the big screen.
   ``I never got caught up in the fame,'' he said. ``Anyone who
knows me knows I didn't change. The only change is that I spent
more time giving of myself.''
   Hill said Mayor Coleman Young and Police Chief William Hart
encouraged him to run for City Council but cautioned him against
campaigning during work hours.
   ``I only campaign after 4 p.m. and Saturdays and Sundays,'' said
Hill.
   He said he doesn't have a fiery temper and sharp tongue like his
character in both ``Beverly Hills Cop'' movies.
   ``You can't do that in real life,'' Hill said. ``These guys have
real guns. You have to be extremely careful.''
   Hill won't give up his acting career. He's awaiting an
announcement for a third ``Beverly Hills Cop'' movie.
   ``I pray for it everyday,'' he said.

   In an attempt to prove that anything can become a
pop hit, two Englishmen have released a dance version of Baa Baa
Black Sheep sung _ or rather bleated _ by Betsy the sheep.
   Five hundred copies of the single by Mark Richards and Ian
Fletcher have been on sale since Monday for about $2 in central
England record stores.
   Aileen Cameron, the secretary at Image Television where Richards
and Fletcher work, described the office as chaotic with requests
for records, photos of Betsy and interviews.
   Richards, who works as a scriptwriter when not acting as Betsy's
manager, said three radio stations have added the song to their
playlists. He said he and Fletcher would also welcome bids to
produce a music video.
   The sounds of the new Baa Baa Black Sheep song filled the Oasis
record store in Derby, 135 miles north of London, which has been
playing it regularly. Sales clerk Tricia Nicholls said Wednesday a
few party disc jockeys had expressed interest but so far, only one
of six copies has been sold.
   The producers said they were surprised by the amount of interest
in their song, which started out as a joke to poke fun at the music
industry's increasing use of electronic mixing.
   ``The Betsy Boogie starts out on hands and knees and then you
chew some grass like a sheep would do,'' Richards explained in an
interview.
   Fletcher told Sky Television: ``It's got certain influences of
some of the songs that are on the charts at the moment. I think we
wanted to prove just how little effort needs to go into making
something to get it into the charts nowadays.''
   Betsy's next hit, Richards said, will be a re-mix of the Beach
Boys' song, Baa Baa Barbara Ann.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Energy Department laboratory in Tennessee
lost a significant amount of radioactive tritium in a test shipment
between lab buildings, raising the possibility of foul play,
government records show.
   Ironically, the secret test was done as part of an internal
investigation into troubling discrepancies in the amount of tritium
shipped from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory at Oak Ridge, Tenn.,
to commercial buyers in recent years.
   Tritium supplies are classified by the government. The material
is produced in Energy Department reactors in South Carolina for use
in nuclear warheads, although small amounts are sold to domestic
and foreign companies. Commercial uses include the manufacture of
luminous lights and biological and energy research.
   No acceptable explanation could be found for the tritium lost in
the test shipment last year, according to an Oak Ridge report
released Wednesday by the Energy Department in response to a
Freedom of Information Act request by The Associated Press.
   The report, dated July 20, raised the possibility of theft but
said this could not be substantiated.
   Jim Alexander, an Oak Ridge spokesman, said Wednesday he did not
know whether the tritium in the test shipment has been recovered.
He said efforts to resolve the discrepancies in commercial
shipments dating back to 1985 were continuing.
   Based on information in the Oak Ridge investigation report, it
appeared about 2 grams of tritium were lost in the shipment between
lab buildings. That is about half the amount used in a single
nuclear warhead, according to private analysts.
   The lab is operated by Martin Marietta Energy Systems Inc. under
an Energy Department contract.
   Commercial shipments from Oak Ridge were suspended in July while
a joint team of experts from the Energy Department and the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission conducted an investigation. This group
reported on July 28 that it could not explain the discrepancies in
the commercial shipments, which amounted to about 5 grams.
   In August the department said it was resuming most shipments and
that it was reasonably sure the missing tritium had not been
diverted to making illicit nuclear weapons.
   The 2 grams of tritium lost in the test shipments was in
addition to the 5 grams missing from commercial sales.
   An internal Martin Marietta memorandum dated Jan. 16, 1989,
indicated that efforts to find the lost 2 grams of tritium were
delayed because one of the buildings involved in the test shipment
was shut down due to an ``unusual occurrence report.''
   The memo was released as an attachment to the Oak Ridge study.
It did not elaborate on the ``unusual occurrence'' but said
``corrective actions'' were under way.
   The tritium mystery began Aug. 11, 1988, when, as part of Oak
Ridge's attempt to find explanations for a series of commercial
shipment discrepancies, the lab loaded 28,615 curies of tritium _ a
little over 2.5 grams _ into a shipping container at one building
and sent it to another. The idea was to prove tritium could be
loaded and removed in a pure form.
   A curie is a standard measure of radioactivity.
   Some of the tritium was unloaded at the second building to take
samples, as planned. It was then reloaded and the entire container
sent back to the first building. This was done over a three-month
period. When the container was unloaded at its final destination
Nov. 14, 1988, only 6,364 curies of tritium were left, the report
said.
   This meant that about three-quarters of the original shipment _
or 2 grams of tritium _ was gone.
   The investigators said they could not find a solid explanation
for the disappearance. They found no evidence that the tritium was
released into a ventilation stack at either of the buildings, nor
that an incorrect amount of tritium was loaded into the container.
   They also dismissed the possibility that the container leaked.
   Another possible explanation was that another container loaded
with a smaller amount was inadvertently switched with the test
container. Investigators said this was unlikely, but that the
possibility would be checked further.

<TEXT>
   Former top officials and military
officers known for their refusal to work with the Soviet-backed
government have formed what they call ``a third force'' to promote
peace in Afghanistan.
   The 15 men, many of whom were educated in the West, seek to
bridge the gap between the Moscow-style government and the
U.S.-backed mujahedeen guerrillas who have been at war for a decade.
   Calling themselves the National Salvation Society, they issued a
manifesto this month calling for an end to both Soviet and American
interference in Afghanistan.
   The society's members, most of whom served former King Zahir
Shah, say they want to unite Afghanistan and start repairing the
damage.
   According to their estimates, which are slightly higher than
information available to the United Nations, 2 million Afghans have
been killed and 7 million have fled the country since the 1978
Marxist revolution. Of the 15 million Afghans inside and outside
the country, 95 percent are illiterate and 70 percent of the arable
land has been abandoned, they say.
   ``We are the group who stayed in Afghanistan during the last 10
years,'' said Mohammad Asghar, the society's chairman and a former
justice minister. ``The destruction has got to such a point that we
felt we would be committing a grave sin if we didn't work for
peace.''
   Other members of the group include former agriculture and
finance ministers, a former national police chief and an
ex-governor of the central bank.
   Foreign diplomats say the group has great popular support.
Speaking on condition of anonymity, diplomats and an Afghan
observer said the group could develop into a potent political force
if it can stay independent of both the government and the
mujahedeen, whose name means Islamic holy warriors.
   ``But their risks are tremendous,'' one diplomat added.
``History has never been kind to moderates.''
   The society's manifesto was carried by the government-run press
and radio station on Oct. 7, but the group insists it is
independent of government control.
   ``We are a third force,'' said Asghar, who studied philosophy
and education at Columbia University in New York. ``Alien powers
have changed our free country into an exercise board of their
politics as well as a theater of international confrontation.
Giving fatal arms and boundless financial support to the warring
sides, they add, at every moment, fuel to the flames of war.''
   The group's manifesto was significant in that it did not
distinguish between the United States and the Soviet Union. It also
pointedly criticized the Kabul government's centralized economic
policies and urged the establishment of a free market economy.
   Abdul Qudoos Majid, the society's secretary and former deputy
minister of mines and industries, said it took 16 days to get the
government to agree to publish the manifesto.
   ``Where else could we have gone to get our message across?''
asked Majid, a graduate of the Colorado School of Mines. ``We also
went to them because we wanted to test the government's sincerity.''
   President Najib has repeatedly asserted that he wants a policy
of national reconciliation. He has escalated his call since the
Soviet Union withdrew its combat troops in February and ended a
decade of direct military intervention in Afghanistan.
   All 15 members of the society served in top government posts
during the reign of Zahir Shah, whose four decades on the throne
ended in 1973 when he was overthrown by his cousin, Mohammad Daoud.
Daoud was assassinated in 1978 when the People's Democratic Party
of Afghanistan seized power.
   Majid, at 60, is the youngest member of the society, whose
average age is 66.
   Several have been jailed, including the deputy chairman, former
Gen. Abdul Hakim Katawazi, whose fingernails were pulled out during
torture sessions by Daoud's regime.
   A government source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the government recently asked Katawazi to become minister of
defense but he refused.
   Afghan observers said the government apparently does not oppose
the group because it might help lure the 74-year-old Zahir Shah
home from exile in Italy. The king is still a popular figure in
Afghanistan, and his return might lend Najib the air of legitimacy
he seeks at home and abroad.
   The mujahedeen refuse to negotiate with Najib's government,
denouncing it as a Soviet puppet.
   The king's return might also fatally fracture the squabbling
mujahedeen alliance, a government source noted. The leaders of the
seven Pakistan-based mujahedeen groups range from bitter
anti-monarchists to former palace advisers who have said they would
not oppose the king's return.
   However, Asghar denied the National Salvation Society was set up
simply to encourage the king's return.
   ``My main problem with the government has always been
ideological,'' the 73-year-old scholar and avowed anti-Marxist
said. ``This whole fight started with the imposition of an alien
system on Afghanistan which was rejected by our people. We want a
system that is based on our own culture.
   ``We also want one that is based on freedom.''

<HEAD>Court Awards $1.3 Million to Victims of Attica Prison Uprising</HEAD>

   More than $800,000 has been awarded to the
widows of two men slain in the bloody police assault on Attica
state prison, but their lawyer says vindication is the sweetest
product of the 18-year-old case.
   Judge Donald Corbett on Wednesday awarded $1.3 million in
damages to seven former Attica inmates or their survivors, saying
the men ``neither participated in the uprising nor resisted in the
retaking'' of the prison by state police.
   The police assault on the prison on Sept. 13, 1971, was
described by an investigating commission as the ``bloodiest
encounter between Americans since the Civil War.''
   Brenda West of Buffalo and Sara Gray of Rochester, whose
husbands were shot to death in the assault, were awarded $475,000
and $385,000, respectively.
   ``They have felt for many years that their husbands had to be
vindicated in some way,'' said their attorney, James Hagerty. ``The
money is very nice, of course, but they feel very good about the
vindication.''
   Hagerty said he would seek interest accruing over 18 years that
would bring the awards for both women to more than $1 million.
   Mrs. West declined to be interviewed on Wednesday, and Mrs. Gray
couldn't be reached for comment.
   More than 1,200 inmates took control of the maximum-security
prison near Buffalo for four days, holding guards and civilians
hostage. The police assault left 39 inmates and employees dead and
80 injured. Four people had died earlier during the prison takeover.
   Three of the seven inmates covered in the lawsuit were killed in
the 10 minutes of police gunfire on inmates. Two others have since
died of unrelated causes and two are still alive.
   Corbett said the state was liable for damages for injuries
``resulting from the intentional use of excessive force.''
   The state will appeal, said James Flateau, spokesman for the
state Criminal Justice director.
   The awards ranged from $35,000 to $475,000, depending on the
inmates' pain and suffering, their families' loss of money based on
their future employment prospects and disfigurement, Corbett said.
   In talks with state authorities during and after the uprising,
inmates objected to what they called degrading conditions at
Attica. They said they'd been locked in their cells 13 hours a day,
were allowed only one shower a week and never knew how their mail
would be censored or if it would be withheld entirely.

<HEAD>Davidson Quitting in 1991 as Kennedy Center Chairman</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing
Arts is looking for a successor to Chairman Ralph P. Davidson, who
plans to quit in early 1991 over unspecified differences with the
center's board of trustees.
   Davidson's announcement Wednesday followed recurring reports
that a majority of the 45-member Kennedy Center board was
dissatisfied with the former Time Inc. executive's management style
and personality clashes.
   At a meeting Wednesday, the board accepted Davidson's advance
notice that he will resign when his three-year contract expires in
February 1991. The trustees issued a statement praising his
``dedication to the center and his many management and programming
initiatives.''
   Trustee James Evans will lead a search committee to find a
successor to Davidson, 62, who has been the $125,000-a-year
chairman and chief executive of the national arts center since
February 1988. Davidson succeeded Broadway producer Roger L.
Stevens, the center's founding chairman.
   Another trustee, former Defense Secretary Melvin Laird, will
chair a transition committee. Davidson said he hoped a successor
could be named by mid-1990.
   ``I arrived at my decision after several discussions with the
board and the realization that we had different priorities and
different expectations of each other,'' Davidson said in a separate
statement.
   ``These differences happen in institutions of all kinds and, as
regrettable as they may be, I fully understand the need for a
change for the sake of the institution,'' said Davidson, who did
not elaborate.
   Reports of growing tensions between Davidson and the trustees
surfaced after the board's last meeting in July.
   The trustees were reported to have criticized Davidson privately
for his aloof management style, arbitrary treatment of the Kennedy
Center staff and failure to attend important social functions.
   Concerns also were raised privately about financing the National
Symphony Orchestra's planned tour of the Soviet Union next
February, and about a breakdown in negotiations for bringing
British producer Duncan Weldon's staging of Shakespeare's ``Richard
II'' and ``Richard III'' to the Kennedy Center.
   There were some complaints that Davidson had failed to meet
fund-raising expectations. But the board's statement Wednesday
praised Davidson's ``efforts to create a satisfactory endowment for
the center and its affiliate, the National Symphony Orchestra.''
   The Kennedy Center receives no federal support, except for
housekeeping services by the National Park Service and occasional
programming grants from the National Endowment for the Arts. Most
of the center's $57 million annual budget is financed by ticket
sales and private contributions.
   Davidson receives $125,000 annually as chief administrator of
the Kennedy Center, the white marble cultural center alongside the
Potomac River which opened in September 1971 as the only official
memorial to President Kennedy.
   Stevens, who supervised construction of the center, served as
its first chairman without salary.

   State Treasurer Robert Bowman got
hooked on fast food as a youthful burger flipper, and he dreams of
the day when doctors will say ``salt is good for you'' and push
saturated fat to prevent heart attacks.
   Bowman quit his job at McDonald's in 1973, but he told about 750
McDonald's assistant managers at a convention Wednesday that Big
Mac sauce will always be in his veins.
   ``I am always proud to be an `alum' of McDonald's,'' Bowman said.
   During seminars at the convention, employees were quizzed on
such matters as ``In what order should a Big Mac, fries and a soda
be presented to a customer?'' and ``What is the proper temperature
setting for cleaning the biscuit oven?''
   Winners got a variety of prizes including McDonald's stock.
   ``I'm an unabashed Number 1 frequenter of McDonald's in this
state, bar none,'' Bowman said. ``I have this dream doctors will
come back in five years and say salt is good for you, saturated fat
is the best thing to prevent a heart attack, and if you eat red
meat three times a day you're going to live to be 120.''
   Bowman was 16 when he got his first job at a McDonald's in
Brookfield, Wis., in 1971. He stayed there two years.
   ``One out of every 15 Americans get their first job at a
McDonald's,'' Bowman said. ``For people to belittle the fast-food
industry is an insult. ... No economy can be based on lawyers and
doctors.''

<HEAD>House Fails to Override Veto on Abortion Funding</HEAD>

   Abortion rights advocates in Congress say
they're not giving up their bid to allow Medicaid abortions for
rape and incest victims, despite falling far short of overriding
President Bush's veto.
   The House sustained Bush's veto Wednesday in a 231-191 vote, 51
fewer than the two-thirds majority needed to overturn a veto.
   Rep. Chris Smith R-N.J., called the vote ``a decisive victory
for the pro-life movement'' and evidence the political ground has
not shifted on the abortion issue, as abortion rights advocates say.
   But Democrats and Republicans who back the more liberal
restrictions argued that public sentiment is on their side and that
the vote will yield far-reaching political damage for Bush among
younger voters.
   ``I am amazed,'' said Rep. Les AuCoin, D-Ore., ``to see the
Republican White House hand over to the Democratic Party a
political generation that's out there and awakening to this issue.''
   ``President Bush may well have stumbled on the one issue that
could cost him re-election,'' said a Republican, Rep. Bill Green of
New York.
   The vote followed Bush's veto on Saturday of the provision,
which is but a paragraph in a $156.7 billion appropriations bill
for health, education and labor programs for the 1990 fiscal year
that began Oct. 1.
   The provision would loosen an eight-year ban on federal
financing of abortions for poor women except in cases where the
woman's life is endangered by her pregnancy. It would have
permitted Medicaid abortions for poor women who are victims of rape
or incest and who ``reported promptly'' to authorities.
   Although it was designed to cover a relatively narrow group of
women, the issue took on symbolic importance in the growing
political struggle over abortion. Its approval by the House two
weeks ago on a 216-206 vote marked the first time that body had
voted the more liberal abortion language, although the Senate has
repeatedly backed it.
   With the agencies continuing to operate under a stopgap spending
measure, the spending bill and vetoed abortion language were sent
back to the House Appropriations Committee for revision.
   Rep. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., and other abortion rights leaders
vowed to offer similar language on other bills and repeatedly put
Bush and anti-abortion House members on the spot.
   ``We will keep on coming back,'' Boxer said.
   House Democratic Whip Bill Gray, D-Pa., said he did not think
Democrats would attempt to add similar abortion language to the
same appropriations bill. Boxer and her allies, however, held out
that possibility.
   Bush, meanwhile, has threatened to veto an appropriations bill
for the District of Columbia because it would allow Washington D.C.
to spend local tax money on Medicaid abortions for victims of rape
and incest.
   Smith and other abortion opponents said Wednesday's vote
demonstrated they can overcome future efforts to weaken the
prohibition on most Medicaid abortions.
   ``They made the mistake of thinking this was a one-round
fight,'' said Rep. Vin Weber, R-Minn. ``Some members who were
panicked by pro-abortion propaganda in the last few weeks are going
to be surprised. ... We're now beginning to see some victories on
our side of the issue.''
   Smith did not rule out the chance a compromise could be reached
if it was ``very, very tight.''
   Fifty-nine Democrats and 132 Republicans voted to sustain the
veto; 42 Republicans joined 189 Democrats in voting to override.
   Abortion-rights supporters picked up a net 15 votes on the
override vote from their vote two weeks ago. But some of those who
switched positions said they did so for other reasons.
   Smith, the anti-abortion leader, attributed most of the switches
to other issues but said there were ``a few marginal members who
have capitulated.''
   Eleven members did not vote, including Rep. James Courter, a
Republican running for governor of New Jersey who has been accused
of waffling on the abortion issue. His opponent, Democratic Rep.
James Florio, voted to override and said Courter ``chose to say
this was not an issue of enough importance to adjust his schedule
to be here.''

   Suspected Maoist rebels set off bombs near the
Soviet and Chinese embassies, causing some damage but no injuries,
police said.
   A spokesman for the police bomb squad said a car bomb exploded
late Wednesday in front of the Chinese Embassy but caused no damage
to the building.
   At the same time, explosions at the Soviet Embassy damaged
windows and part of the structure, police said. Spokesman Lt. Tello
Ramirez said it was not clear whether the damage was caused by a
car bomb or by explosives thrown at the building.
   Both embassies are in the wealthy suburb of San Isidro, three
miles from the downtown area.
   Radio reports said another car bomb exploded near a government
building in downtown Lima. There were no reports of damage. Police
also deactivated a car bomb near a church in the suburb of
Miraflores.
   No group claimed responsibility for the blasts, but Maoist
Shining Path rebels have attacked the embassies in the past.
   In July 1986, Shining Path rebels attacked the Soviet Embassy
with submachine guns and dynamite. One attacker died after
penetrating the embassy grounds when a bomb exploded in his hands.
   The Shining Path views the current governments in China and the
Soviet Union as traitors to true Marxism, and considers Soviets
enemies for supplying arms to Peru's government.
   The Shining Path has been fighting Peru's elected government
since 1980, when it launched its insurgency near the highland city
of Ayacucho, 235 miles southeast of Lima.
   The government says more than 15,000 people have died in the
violence, including police, soldiers, rebels, government officials
and civilians.

   ``Today'' show weatherman Willard Scott says
he's staying, but he's sure friend and colleague Jane Pauley will
be leaving the NBC-TV show on which she's been co-host for 13 years.
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Scott said he talked
with Pauley after Wednesday's broadcast. She didn't specifically
say she was leaving, but left the impression of ```I'm so glad and
the decision is made,''' Scott said.
   Pauley, who turns 39 on Tuesday, reportedly has been unhappy
with changes on the program, including the Sept. 5 move of Deborah
Norville from ``NBC News at Sunrise'' to ``Today.''
   Some speculation has it that Norville eventually will succeed
Pauley as co-host of ``Today'' with Bryant Gumbel.
   Despite heavy publicity about Pauley's reported unhappiness,
Scott said, ``I would have bet the family farm that she never was
going to leave. But from what I saw today, I don't think there's
any question'' that she will.
   Pauley, whose reported discontent also includes concern that two
new layers of management will oversee the show, did not reply to a
request for comment. She previously has declined to discuss when
and if she'll leave ``Today.''

   Having Ruth Westheimer address an education
conference on sex is like inviting Timothy Leary to speak on drugs,
a state senator says.
   Republican state Sen. James Donovan said Wednesday he's
boycotting the annual conference of the state School Boards
Association because the noted sex therapist is speaking there.
   ``I think her whole message is one that's immoral,'' the Utica
legislator said. ``There's no promotion of high moral standards.
It's `whatever feels good, do it,' notwithstanding your parents'
instruction or generally how you feel about sex outside of
marriage.''
   Westheimer laughed when reached at her New York City office for
a reaction to Donovan's statements.
   ``If issues of sexuality enter politics, that would make me very
sad,'' Westheimer said. ``I'm not a politician and I'm not a
theologian. I don't judge other people's morals. What I am is an
educator.''

   Kelsey Grammer, who plays a psychiatrist on
NBC's ``Cheers,'' will enter a drug abuse education program to
avoid a possible prison term for cocaine possession.
   He told a Municipal Court judge Wednesday he missed a court
appearance the previous day because of confusion over dates. Judge
Aviva Bobb had withheld issuing an order for his arrest until today.
   Grammer, 34, who plays Frasier Crane on the popular sitcom, was
accused of one felony count of cocaine possession. If he
successfully completes the court-sponsored program, Grammer could
have the case dismissed and his record would be cleared. He had no
previous record.
   Police say Grammer was stopped while driving April 14 for having
an expired license plate. Officers learned he did not have a
driver's license, only a learner's permit. A computer check showed
an outstanding speeding ticket, authorities said.
   En route to the police station, he allegedly dropped a small
packet containing about a quarter-gram of cocaine on the seat of
the police car, prosecutors said.

   Indicted Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi won a
brief reprieve from his court-ordered confinement to his Manhattan
penthouse, gaining a judge's permission to spend two weeks in
Southern California.
   Khashoggi's trip, scheduled to begin Friday, is an exception to
travel restrictions attached to his release on $10 million bail
while he awaits a March trial on charges he helped Imelda and
Ferdinand Marcos defraud the Philippine treasury.
   While in California, Khashoggi's movements will continue to be
monitored by an electronic ankle bracelet, as ordered by U.S.
District Judge John Keenan.
   His attorney, Robert Morvillo, said Wednesday that Khashoggi's
stay in Los Angeles could be characterized as ``part business, part

   Jimmy ``The Greek'' Synder, who used to share
his football forecasts with TV viewers, now wants to make sure he's
paid for his picks, a lawyer for the oddsmaker says.
   The Baltimore Bulletin Inc., known as the Mike Warren Sports and
Jimmy ``The Greek'' Sports Service, filed suit in U.S. District
Court against a Reno sports information service accused of selling
Snyder's and Warren's football picks without permission.
   Their attorney, Robert Schulman, said Consensus Sports Service
is somehow getting their football picks and is serving as a
middleman to make thousands of dollars by selling the predictions
to customers.
   ``They are pirating the picks from Jimmy `The Greek' and Warren,
but we're not sure how,'' Schulman said Wednesday in a telephone
interview from his Baltimore office.
   Dave Strout, manager of the Consensus office, said the company
had no immediate comment on the suit filed Tuesday. He said Gerrard
Byrnes, founder, owner and operator of the sports information
service, was out of town and couldn't be reached for comment.
   The lawsuit seeks $100,000 in damages plus other costs.

   The Canton Trade Fair, once China's only
export showcase, has a renewed importance this fall as Chinese
officials use the event to lure back overseas traders after the
bloody crackdown on dissent.
   But foreign traders say attendance is down from previous years.
   In addition, a Hong Kong textile trader claims, some Chinese
exporters from state-run enterprises are protesting the crackdown
by dragging their feet on soliciting new business.
   ``They are angry about the government, but they cannot criticize
it. So they hold back the goods,'' he said.
   The autumn edition of the biannual fair, running Oct. 15-31,
``is the first one to be held after the suppression of the
counterrevolutionary rebellion,'' says Wang Pingqing, vice minister
at the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade.
   ``It is a window showing China's determination to carry on its
open-door policy,'' he says. ``Counterrevolutionary rebellion'' is
what the Communist government calls last spring's pro-democracy
demonstrations.
   Hundreds, perhaps thousands of people, were killed when the
Chinese military crushed the Beijing protests in early June. The
crackdown prompted many foreign businessmen to flee the country.
   The significance of this autumn's fair may thus be more
political than economic.
   ``China just wants to show that it is safe to do business
here,'' said the Hong Kong textile trader, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   The 156,000-square-yard glass exhibition complex for the fair is
now under tight security, with armed military police guarding the
grounds in this southern city on the Pearl River, about 90 miles
northwest of Hong Kong.
   Inside the five-story building, products ranging from clothing
to AK-47 machine guns are on display.
   At a medical equipment center, a few people crowded around a
``portable hospital'' that takes readings on heartbeat and
breathing. In the toy section, business negotiations took place in
rooms lined with dolls and puppets.
   The fair's propaganda office claimed 21,000 guests visited
during the first five days, a 10 percent drop from the spring
exhibition. China's official Xinhua News Agency reported Tuesday
that the number of foreign businessmen was greater than the
previous fair without providing statistics.
   However, foreign businessmen who attended previous fairs say
crowds are thinner.
   ``In the past, it was hard to move around. This year, there are
fewer people, especially foreigners,'' the Hong Kong textile trader
said.
   Also, the number of Chinese exporters appears to have dropped as
some companies that traditionally exhibit have stayed away as part
of the country's economic austerity program that began last year.
   Fair officials claim that transactions in the first five days
were $800 million, up 14.6 percent from the same period of the
spring gathering. However, it is not clear whether all of those
were negotiated after the June crackdown.
   A Hong Kong garment merchant claimed that ``the entire fair is
just a show. Deals are negotiated beforehand. They (traders) just
go there to sign the contract so that the Chinese side can have a
figure to give to the government.''
   The Canton Trade Fair began in 1957, when Communist China had
frosty relations with the Western world. It was the only event
organized by China for Western businessmen to shop for Chinese
goods.
   In the past decade, China has opened its doors to the West under
leader Deng Xiaoping's modernization program. Western businessmen
have been allowed to negotiate directly with Chinese enterprises
and to set up offices in China, diminishing the importance of the
fair.
   Some of the foreign merchants at the fair said business must go
on despite the crackdown on dissent.
   ``Trade is trade. The government can do anything. It is not my
business,'' said Japanese businessman Zigumi Onodera, who has
traded with China for 13 years.
   Although his sales of chemical materials to China have declined
30 percent compared to a year ago because of the country's foreign
exchange shortage, Onodera said he planned to attend the fair every
day.
   ``China is the world's biggest market,'' he said.

   Thousands of illegal aliens who fled civil
strife in El Salvador, Nicaragua and China could be given haven in
the United States for three years under an immigration package
approved by the House.
   The measure designed to protect as many as 750,000 exiles from
deportation was approved 258-162 on Wednesday and goes to the
Senate.
   ``These are people who need our help and we are in a position to
help them,'' Rep. Joe Moakley, D-Mass., said in urging support.
   The bill would suspend for three years deportation of illegal
aliens who fled El Salvador, Nicaragua and China if they were in
the United States when the measure went into effect and if they
registered within nine months.
   It also would establish a system for extending temporary status
to citizens of additional countries beset by armed conflict and
natural disaster.
   Approval came despite warnings from opponents that it would
encourage job-hungry Central Americans to come north in the guise
of political exiles.
   ``It isn't right to say to American workers that we are going to
take your job away from you and give it to people who came here to
take your job away from you in the first place,'' said Rep. Bob
Walker, R-Pa.
   Moakley noted that the measure has support from the AFL-CIO and
a number of large labor unions.
   Proponents said 70,000 Salvadorans and 30,000 Nicaraguan
civilians have been killed by civil war over the last decade and
that 10,000 democracy demonstrators have been jailed in China.
   ``I think its in our interest to have Nicaraguans and
Salvadorans living in the open rather than maintaining an
underground existence,'' Rep. Hamilton Fish, R-N.Y., told the House.
   However, Rep. Helen Bentley, R-Md., cited estimates that the
price of operating the program could reach $260 million over two
years.
   ``I can tell you that my constituents will not abide by it,''
she said.

<HEAD>Government Says American Wine Sales Boom in France</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People in France, the classic home of fine
wines, are developing a taste for American vintages, the Department
of Agriculture says.
   This country shipped 72,400 gallons of wine to France last year,
five times as much as in 1985. One reason for the increase is the
fall in the price of the dollar, which makes American wines cheaper
in France than they used to be.
   There are other reasons, too, according to Holly S. Higgins, who
recently finished an assignment as U.S. agricultural attache in
Paris.
   ``Press articles and tastings featuring U.S. wines are
popular,'' she wrote in the October issue of the department's
monthly ``AgExporter.''
   ``The food and drink press has focused on quality, the high
level of technology used in producing U.S. wines and the fact that
the United States has an excellent selection of regional wine such
as California, Washington, New York, Virginia and Texas.''
   Despite the enthusiasm of French consumers, the French
government still worries about U.S. wineries using such traditional
French names as Chablis, Champagne and Burgundy, she said. The
French consider that these geographical names belong to them.
   The U.S. government has agreed not to export wines with such
labels to France or the other 11 countries in the European Economic
Community, but the ban does not extend to American shipments to
other markets, such as Latin America or the Far East.
   Steve Burns, international marketing manager for the Wine
Institute, said he saw no difficulty about the ban.
   ``We'd rather label our wines by the variety of grape:
chardonnay or cabernet or pinot noir,'' he said in an interview.
   ``It's easier for people in a hurry. They don't have to worry
about whether the Burgundy they're looking at is the right year to
go with the kind of meal they're having. There's enough mystery in
wine already. We're trying to make it more of an everyday affair.''
   He said sales in France from California, where most American
wine is produced, were up 185 percent last year.
   According to Ms. Higgins' figures, the French favor American
reds and what the French call rose or pink wines _ now sometimes
called ``blush'' wines in this country. There was a drop last year
in sales to France of American white wines, which many Americans
favor over reds.
   The total value of U.S. wine sales to France is still small:
$1.2 million last year. France bought $182 million worth from Italy
and $95 million worth from Portugal, much of it to mix with French
wines under French labels. But in 1985 the total value of U.S. wine
sales to France was only $155,000.
   ``Prospects for greater U.S. sales in the French market are
bright,'' Ms. Higgins wrote. ``U.S. exporters can expect the French
market to expand in the future as U.S. wines gain acceptance and
find their niche in the marketplace.''

<HEAD>Most FAA Flight Inspectors Not Qualified to Fly, GAO Study Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most federal inspectors who check airline
pilots aren't qualified to fly and many who monitor airliner safety
are undertrained, a congressional study found.
   Airlines may be fined or denied certificates to fly if their
pilots fail to update their training, but the Federal Aviation
Administration often waives the training requirements for its own
inspectors, the General Accounting Office report said.
   The study released Wednesday by the congressional investigative
agency said only 291 of 786, or 37 percent, of FAA inspectors who
made pilot flight checks in the last half of 1988 had up-to-date
flying credentials.
   Federal rules require that both pilots and flight inspectors
undergo semiannual flight training to operate airliners.
   The report, requested by the House Committee on Public Works and
Transportation's aviation subcommittee, said FAA airworthiness
inspectors took only about half the training classes for which they
were scheduled in fiscal 1988 because so many were canceled.
   Inspectors accompany pilots on flights to determine their
ability to operate assigned aircraft, while airworthiness
inspectors check airliners to see if they are fit to fly.
   ``FAA inspectors are not receiving the training that FAA's
managers say they need to effectively perform their assigned
jobs,'' the report said. ``Although FAA has several initiatives
under way, further improvements are needed in the aviation safety
inspector training program.''
   The study praised a program in the FAA's Southwest Region to
reassign flight inspectors so that training needs were reduced, and
said it should be adopted agency-wide.
   Many inspectors are trained for planes they rarely see while
others are assigned to planes they aren't qualified to fly, the
report said, recommending the FAA order a re-evaluation of the
roles and responsibilities of flight inspectors.
   The report said FAA officials contacted for the study generally
agreed with its findings and recommendations.
   The study said that although student enrollment at the
government's academy for airworthiness inspectors had increased
from 2,968 in 1984 to 4,322 in 1988, the number of instructors had
fallen from 82 to 77.
   That has resulted in several classes being canceled and the
inability to develop classes to detail new aviation technology, it
said.

<HEAD>Two Members of Congress Plan Lebanon Trip Despite Ban</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two members of Congress want to visit Lebanon
to win support for a proposal to end the country's 14-year civil
war, but the State Department is worried about their safety.
   Reps. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio, and Nick Rahall, D-W.Va., want to
meet with Gen. Michel Aoun, the leader of Lebanon's predominantly
Christian army who has rejected the peace plan, according to
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   However, the State Department has banned most travel by
Americans to Lebanon because the situation ``is so dangerous that
no U.S. citizen can be considered safe from terrorist acts.''
   Eight Americans are being held hostage by pro-Iranian radicals.
   Rahall's office said it could ``neither confirm nor deny it, for
security reasons.'' A spokesman for Ms. Oakar, Jim Belles, said he
could not obtain information about her plans.
   Ms. Oakar, who like Rahall is of Lebanese descent, tried to
visit Lebanon in August, but sources said the State Department
advised her to cancel the trip.
   U.S. passports are invalid for travel to Lebanon unless special
permission is obtained. Violation of the ban can be punishable by
imprisonment or a fine.
   The U.S. embassy was evacuated last month after Aoun made veiled
threats to take American hostages to draw attention to his fight
for expulsion of 40,000 Syrian troops.
   ``We don't oppose their talking to him (Aoun), but we can't
offer any support or help if they get in trouble,'' said one
official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Meanwhile, the White House ruled out pressuring Aoun to accept
the plan.
   ``That's ... an internal matter for Lebanon and the various
factions there to deal with,'' said presidential spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater.
   The plan adopted by Christian and Moslem legislators in
closed-door meetings in Saudi Arabia would shift political control
from the Christian minority to the Moslem majority.
   Aoun called on Lebanese lawmakers to reject the plan when it
comes up for a vote next month.

<HEAD>Gingrich Faces New Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House ethics committee is being asked once
more to investigate allegations against Republican Whip Newt
Gingrich.
   Rep. Bill Alexander, D-Ark., filed additional ethics charges
Wednesday alleging the Georgia congressman violated campaign
finance and financial disclosure statutes.
   Alexander said his new charges, with 670 pages of supporting
documents, should motivate the panel to open an official
preliminary investigation.
   An independent law firm hired by the committee to look into
earlier charges against Gingrich reported last week that it had
found no reason to proceed with such an inquiry, suggesting that
the panel might be ready to drop the ethics case.
   The committee is tentatively scheduled to meet Tuesday.
   But some on the committee, formally called the Committee on
Standards of Official Conduct, say they are bothered by that
recommendation and believe an easier standard is being applied to
Gingrich than was applied to House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas.
   Wright resigned May 31 after a long ethics probe that began when
Gingrich filed a complaint.
   Rich Galen, a Gingrich spokesman, called the new charges part of
``a personal vendetta'' by Alexander.
   Among Alexander's new charges:
   _Gingrich funneled $12,000 worth of advertising and $20,000 in
contributions to the 1986 re-election campaign of Sen. Mack
Mattingly, R-Ga., but failed to report the gifts as required by
federal election law.
   _A commercial travel agency in Florida, Marathon Travel, used
letters from Gingrich on official congressional letterhead to
solicit business. Use of a lawmaker's official position to promote
commercial ventures is against House rules.
   _Gingrich sought to influence federal agencies to help a Georgia
businessman who was a member of a partnership formed in 1977 to
underwrite a Gingrich book-writing effort. The businessman, Chester
Roush Jr., reportedly received $12 million in federal subsidies
since Gingrich was elected in 1978.
   _Gingrich failed to report the purchase of a house with his
daughter, as required on annual financial disclosure forms. The
house was bought from a longtime political supporter of Gingrich,
Alexander said.
   _A political action committee Gingrich chairs, Conservatives for
Hope and Opportunity, raised more than $217,000 to support
conservative candidates but donated only $900 to campaigns. The
rest was spent on Gingrich's travel and expenses, the complaint
charged, making the solicitation for money a ``prohibited scheme''
under the law.

   If the vote had been left only to its women
members, the House would have had the two-thirds majority to
override President Bush's veto of expanded Medicaid abortion
coverage to cases of rape and incest.
   Eighteen of the 27 women members voted to override, eight voted
to sustain and one didn't vote.
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., a pro-choice advocate, said
she thinks women better understand the problem.
   ``This is a crime that only impacts on women,'' she said after
the 231-191 vote that failed to achieve the two-thirds majority
needed to override the veto.
   Bush said he vetoed the massive bill that sets the budget for
the departments of labor, education and health and human services
because he opposes spending federal funds on abortions for women
who have been raped or are the victims of incest.
   ``They don't get it. For the men, it's all hypothetical,''
Schroeder said, although she conceded that many men are sympathetic
to the problem.
   Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., implored members to override the
veto in an impassioned speech describing the affects of rape and
incest on women and girls.
   ``The issue has clearly been drawn that this is about the rights
of women,'' Miller said.
   Tamar Raphael of the Feminist Majority noted the bipartisan
nature of the women's vote in favor of overriding.
   ``The first thing this says to us is that we need more women
casting votes,'' said Raphael, whose organization is devoted to
increasing the number of women in politics and all aspects of
professional life. Women make up 6 percent of the House membership.
   Eight of the 12 Republican women members, or 66.6 percent, voted
against Bush's veto, as did 10 of the 14 Democratic women present,
or 71 percent.
   Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, didn't vote because she was attending
an out-of-town funeral.
   Raphael said abortion would not be an issue if Congress were 50
percent women.
   ``The reason we were so successful in Florida was because women
were chairing the committees,'' Raphael said.
   The Florida Legislature recently refused to accept greater
restrictions on abortion as proposed by the governor. The proposals
were blocked in committee and never reached the floor.
   Raphael said the Pennsylvania Legislature, which tightened
abortion restrictions this week, has fewer women members than all
but five other states.

<HEAD>Easing of Restrictions on Farm Aid Approved by Senate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers who planted crops to replace those
damaged or destroyed by drought this year would get increased
federal disaster aid under legislation approved by the Senate.
   The bill represents a boon to farmers who say Agriculture
Department restrictions are too stringent and fail to take into
account the expense involved in producing replacement crops this
year.
   It goes to the House after winning Senate approval on a voice
vote Wednesday.
   The Agriculture Department imposed the restrictions with an eye
to preventing farmers from collecting disaster payments for crop
damage and then keeping the entire amount while producing a new
crop on the same acreage in the same growing season.
   The idea is that the disaster payments are designed to offset
losses and should not go to farmers whose losses were reduced or
even erased through production of a second crop.
   But the Senate has been more sympathetic to growers, who say the
department's restrictions were unrealistically tight-fisted.
   ``This should more accurately reflect the expenses and income of
the farmer,'' Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said in a statement.
   ``In addition, it will protect the many farmers who are making
little if any profit on that second crop from losing the disaster
payments which they were expecting on the first crop.''
   The bill earlier was one of many provisions for special
interests included in a major deficit-reduction measure. But it
became a casualty when lawmakers removed all such features from the
deficit reduction plan.
   The Agriculture Department has been planning to deduct 75
percent of the gross value of any replacement crop from such a
farmer's disaster aid check.
   The bill would modify the system considerably.
   In figuring the value of the replacement crop, the department
would first deduct 50 percent of the county average yield for the
second crop.
   The initial plan would require even farmers who had replanted
only a few acres to wait until harvesting their second crop before
obtaining disaster benefits for damage to the first crop.
   That would be canceled under the legislation.
   Meanwhile, the Senate also approved on a voice vote and sent to
the House a bill that would allow the Agriculture Department to
allow oat producers to plant their entire base acreage and still
remain in the farm program.
   The department requires them as a condition of being in the
program to refrain from planting on a portion of the historical
acreage base they use for oats.
   The provision was contained in a bill with features designed to
aid an array of farm interests.
   The measure also would earmark $14 million this fiscal year,
$9.3 million next year and $4.6 million the year after to boost
U.S. beef exports. The payments would be in cash or commodities
under the Export Enhancement Program, a major sources of subsidies
to stimulate overseas shipments over the last five years.
   The measure also contained technical changes in programs
operated by the department for egg producers, peanut growers and
research into new commercial products derived from plant materials.

   Debbie Newhall's address has not changed
but the location of her mountain home has. And the killer
earthquake to blame may have even more fury to unleash.
   Landslides that already have consumed 100 homes and damaged more
than 300 now threaten hundreds more in the Santa Cruz Mountains,
just a few miles from the epicenter of the Oct. 17 quake.
   ``I'm afraid this whole area is going to go,'' said Mrs.
Newhall, whose damaged home sits on the edge of a hill. The house
moved a couple of inches during the quake, cracking its foundation
posts, separating floors from walls and destroying the fireplace.
   ``I sit here at night and listen to rain pouring down. You hear
things falling from the trees. A big stick will come down and hit
the roof. You're wondering if that'll be the straw that pushes the
house down the hill,'' she said.
   The aftershocks _ more than 4,000 _ carry a different kind of
worry. ``We sleep with one kid under one arm and one under another,
so we can jump up and run out the door,'' she said.
   Geologists worry that heavy winter rains falling into huge gaps
in the Earth created by the quake could cause landslides.
   ``The big concern is if it's going to rain, how much and how
fast?'' said Gary Griggs, a University of California, Santa Cruz,
geologist.
   ``If we have a wet winter, there's a potential for a lot of
slides,'' Wilson Scaling, chief of the federal Soil Conservation
Service, said Wednesday after touring the area by helicopter.
   ``I feel very sorry for these folks. They're kind of sitting on
a powder keg. The potential is there for something else, but
hopefully that won't occur.''
   But earthquakes and the threat of landslides won't drive some
people away from the forests of redwood, oak and pine that rest
high above the scenic coastal section.
   ``If you want the beauty of California, you have to suffer
earthquakes,'' said Kieran Reid as he replaced damaged beams under
his house. ``People in the flatland, they got the shock, too.''
   Others have surrendered. ``I want to get to lower ground,'' said
renter Carol McCabe.
   Mrs. McCabe said she's still jittery from the quake. ``I can't
spend 15 minutes in the house. It's a wonderful place to be, but I
just can't go back.''
   Seventeen-year resident Beverly Bires, the victim of a house
fire a year ago, said she's packing up and leaving for Oregon.
   ``What part of me the fire didn't scare off the earthquake did.
You stay and stay and stay. After Tuesday, I said it's over.''

<HEAD>House Boosts FHA Loan Cap, Retains 41 Pet Projects</HEAD>

   Larger home loans backed by the Federal
Housing Administration would be available in many of the nation's
most expensive housing markets under legislation passed by the
House.
   By voice vote Wednesday, lawmakers agreed to raise the $101,250
limit on the size of mortgages the FHA can insure to $124,875.
   Supporters said the higher ceiling would help people buy
costlier homes, while opponents argued it would expose the
government to steeper losses if the borrowers default.
   The median price of homes already exceeds $101,250 in 18 states
and Washington, D.C., the National Association of Home Builders
says.
   Jane DeMarines, spokeswoman for the Mortgage Bankers
Association, estimated 100,000 new home loans could be made in 76
cities under the bill.
   The $67 billion housing, development, veterans and space program
bill containing the loan cap returns to the Senate, which approved
the FHA language last month and is expected to do so again.
   The legislation also contains money to finance a New Jersey arts
center, a Michigan library and 39 other pet projects that lawmakers
voted to retain despite opponents' arguments that the distribution
of the money smacks of favoritism.
   Opponents complained that the projects, worth $28.4 million,
were largely spread among the congressional districts of members of
the House Appropriations Committee, which produced the legislation.
   They said that none had been approved by the Department of
Housing and Urban Development, from whose coffers the money would
come. But opponents lost an attempt to strip the projects from a
housing and development bill on a 250-170 vote.
   The money for the 41 pet projects would come from a fund the
secretary of housing uses to distribute money at his discretion for
community development programs. Included in the legislation was
$1.2 million for a Newark, N.J., performing arts center, $180,000
for a bridge in Leake County, Miss., and $390,000 for a library and
recreation center in Mackinac Island, Mich.
   Opponents compared the method of the projects' selection to
former HUD officials accused of awarding funds to proposals backed
by political cronies.
   ``The only thing the projects have in common is they either have
someone on the committee, or someone to ask for it,'' said Rep.
Steve Bartlett, R-Texas, who led the effort to strip the funds.
   Supporters said Congress had as much right as administration
officials to decide how funds are spent, accusing opponents of sour
grapes.
   ``I guess what this proves is if a project is in your district,
it's a vitally needed project,'' said Rep. William Green, R-N.Y.
``If it's in a neighbor's district, it's pork.''
   The overall bill, a compromise between previous House and Senate
versions, was approved 363-53 Tuesday in the first day of debate on
the measure. Under special rules, disputed provisions were
considered after the rest of the legislation was approved.
   The bill provides $12.4 billion for NASA, including $1.8 billion
for the planned space station. It also makes available $5.6 billion
for the Environmental Protection Agency, $11.4 billion for
veterans' medical care, and $15.1 billion for housing programs.

<HEAD>Transportation Officials Watching Plans for Private Toll Road</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN HAYWOOD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LEESBURG, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Transportation officials at home and abroad
are watching plans for a 15-mile stretch of road in congested
northern Virginia that the builder says will be the first private
U.S. toll road in 30 years.
   ``I love a traffic jam,'' said Ralph L. Stanley, former chief of
the federal Urban Mass Transportation Administration and president
of the Toll Road Corp. of Virginia. ``They're all customers to me.''
   The $155 million road would extend the existing Dulles Toll
Road, adding a third east-west route from the Leesburg area to the
nation's capital, Stanley said.
   ``This idea needs a tire-kicking example,'' said Stanley.
``Virginia to me is a case study of what is happening in a lot of
other states. It's happening all over the world. It's just a matter
of time.''
   As proposed, the toll would be 8 to 10 cents a mile or about
$1.50 for commuters who travel the entire route. It would be
eliminated once they had paid for the road, he said. ``That's the
advantage to it,'' he said. ``The toll would be temporary.''
   The State Corporation Commission must approve the plan. Stanley
said he hoped to hear by Nov. 30.
   Stanley said the road could be finished by the end of 1991, 15
months sooner than the state has said it could complete the route.
That's because as a private company, Toll Road Corp. would not have
to hold bond referendums or open work to competitive bidding.
   Another advantage to construction handled by a private company
as opposed to the state is ease in acquiring land, Stanley said.
Most of the land needed is being donated by property owners who see
the need for such a road, he said.
   Supporters say allowing a private company to build the road also
would mean the state could spend its money on other needed projects.
   ``People don't care who builds it,'' Stanley said. ``The
Virginia Department of Transportation doesn't build roads. They
hire the same guys we're hiring to build roads.''
   State transportation officials acknowledged that the company
could build the road faster and at a lower initial cost, but said
the road would cost more in the long run because the company must
pay higher interest rates than the state.
   Ray Pethtel, the department's commissioner, said overwhelming
public support for the private road outweighed such concerns.
   The Virginia General Assembly passed legislation in 1988
allowing private companies to finance and build roads.
   Great Britain and Mexico have passed similar laws, as has
California, which is now faced with rebuilding roads damaged from
last week's earthquake. A bill also has passed in the Illinois
Senate. Louisiana and Florida also are considering such bills,
Stanley said.
   ``We just don't have the transportation dollars to meet the
transportation needs in the state,'' said Tracey Weatherby,
spokeswoman for the California Department of Transportation
   Transportation planners aren't the only ones keeping an eye on
the proposal.
   ``We needed it yesterday,'' said Brian Carroll, who commutes 42
miles from Leesburg to Washington every day.
   Even though Carroll is in a van pool, it takes him 90 minutes
during rush hour.
   ``It's pretty much a nightmare,'' he said. ``It takes a long
time for that many miles. The roads have not kept up with the
growth in that area.''
   Stanley said he has been approached by officials in other states
to build private roads, but for now he is looking for more projects
in Virginia such as repairing some of the 2,500 bridges identified
by the Department of Transportation as structurally deficient.
   ``You can postpone a new road,'' he said. ``You can't postpone a
defective bridge.''
   Stanley anticipates no problems with tolls. ``I personally
believe people will pay tolls if it's a direct user fee,'' said
Stanley.

<TEXT>
   President Bush's ``unwillingness to take a
strong lead'' in developing a U.S. high-definition television
industry is hurting America's ability to compete overseas, HDTV
proponents say.
   More than 100 business leaders, members of Congress and
technical experts wrote to Bush on Wednesday to say they were
``deeply disturbed that the United States is failing to match
Japanese and European efforts on HDTV,'' according to the
Congressional HDTV Caucus.
   The caucus said that among those signing the letter were John
Mitchell, chairman of Motorola Corp.; Robert Noyce, head of the
Sematech computer-chip consortium; Jerry Pearlman, chief executive
officer of Zenith Corp., which has proposed a U.S. HDTV
transmission system; and Mitchell Kertzman, chairman of the
American Electronics Association, which has urged the government to
commit $1.35 billion in matching funds over five years to spur HDTV
development.
   More than 25 members of Congress signed the letter, the caucus
said.
   HDTV proponents say the new technology, which promises motion
picture-sharp images and compact disc-quality sound, could be the
``technology driver'' that could revitalize the U.S. electronics
industry and have important applications in medicine, defense and
other industries.
   But a Congressional Budget Office report in August said HDTV
claims were ``very optimistic'' and that even under the rosiest of
scenarios, HDTV sales will be small relative to other electronic
equipment markets.
   The House has appropriated $50 million development money for
next year, and the Defense Advanced Projects Agency is providing
$30 million in seed money for defense-related HDTV equipment.
   But the Bush administration otherwise has shown little
inclination to push HDTV development.
   Rep. Mel Levine, D-Calif., co-chair of the caucus, said
Wednesday that ``the Bush administration's unwillingness to take a
strong lead on HDTV seriously handicaps this nation's ability to
compete internationally.''
   ``While the Japanese and Europeans outpace our technology
efforts daily, the administration sits on the sidelines waiting for
an economic miracle to revitalize our industrial base,'' he said.
``We need an HDTV initiative today, not promises of a broader
technology program tomorrow.''
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher told Congress earlier this
year that developing a policy on HDTV was among the
administration's highest priorities, although the government didn't
plan to play ``uncle sugar'' to American industry.
   But Commerce officials last month said that outlook had changed
and the administration now was looking at HDTV only as part of a
broad-based effort to boost U.S. technological competitiveness.
   Congressional sources said then that Mosbacher was slapped down
by the White House for making statements that smacked of the
``industrial policy'' that had been advocated by Bush's Democratic
opponent, Michael Dukakis, in the 1988 presidential campaign.

   In an effort to regain public acceptance,
the government is disbanding units of the widely despised secret
police, reducing eavesdropping and focusing police resources on
fighting crime, commanders say.
   Many of the opposition activists the secret police had long made
a practice of watching and harassing under one-party Communist rule
became lawmakers and Cabinet ministers this year.
   Six undercover departments are being disbanded, there will be
less bugging and units that inspected foreign mail and monitored
foreign radio broadcasts will be dissolved, police officials told a
news conference.
   ``The Interior Ministry is going to strive for public acceptance
and prestige,'' said Wojciech Garstka, spokesman for the Interior
Ministry, which is in charge of the police.
   Garstka was joined by the deputy chiefs of the regular and
secret police for the unusual news conference Wednesday.
   He characterized the changes being made in the country's police
as ``perhaps the deepest in postwar history.''
   Despite Solidarity's leading role in the new government, the
Interior Ministry is still run by the Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak, a
long-time Communist and confidant of President Wojciech Jaruzelski.
   Jerzy Karpacz, deputy chief of the secret police, said the
officers ``not only fully accept these changes, but are aware that
the changes are irreversible. If any are found with a different
view, they will have to leave the force.''
   The secret police long symbolized Communist control by fear.
They are bitterly remembered as the executors of Stalinist purges,
as infiltrators of opposition groups and as thugs who roughed up
activists.
   Three rogue officers and their commander from the so-called
``fourth department,'' which spied on the church, were convicted of
the 1984 kidnapping and murder of Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko, a
charismatic Solidarity priest.
   The fourth department and five other units, including those
responsible for surveillance of citizens' loyalty and protection of
the agricultural, manufacturing and arms industries have been
liquidated, Garstka announced.
   Despite the changes, three new secret police units will be
formed, he said. One will guard against political extremists and
terrorists who ``do not want to become legal'' under new freedoms,
another will safeguard the economy against espionage and
disruption, and a third will analyze security information and
develop new methods, especially for crime prevention, he said.
   Also, counter-intelligence efforts will be strengthened, he said.
   More emphasis will be put on protecting public safety and
property, Garstka said, and some secret police officers will be
transferred to help combat what he said was an alarming rise in
thefts and burglaries.
   There are now about 1,250 crimes per 100,000 people annually,
which Garstka said is relatively low by Western standards. But more
car break-ins and other crimes are being reported as the economic
situation worsens and the gap between rich and poor widens.
   There are many vacancies in the police because of low pay and
low prestige, said Zbigniew Nowicki, deputy commander of the
regular police force. He said that in some Warsaw precincts, 59
percent of the positions are vacant.
   The 12,500-strong ZOMO riot police, disbanded in a highly
symbolic move Sept. 29, will be replaced by ``prevention squads''
of 5,177 officers in 22 of the 49 provinces, Garstka said. They
will be supplemented by 13,000 men serving in the police as an
alternative to mandatory military duty.
   Karpacz denied there was a special police unit to monitor
foreign journalists. But he would not answer directly whether
Western reporters' offices and homes were bugged.
   Garstka said the Interior Ministry is prepared to provide all
materials requested by a special parliament commission
investigating accusations that security forces are responsible for
more than 90 deaths.
   However, he said an internal investigation did not find ``any
role of the security service in these deaths.''

<HEAD>Calif. Consumers Don't Notice Warnings, But Like Information</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER KERR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   They're everywhere in California:
ominous signs warning consumers of some dangerous chemical that
could spread the plagues of cancer or birth defects.
   ``WARNING: Detectable amounts of chemicals known to the state to
cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm may be found
in and around this facility.''
   These ubiquitous warnings were required by Proposition 65, the
environmentalist-backed ballot initiative approved three years ago.
   Industry groups say because the signs are so widespread, they
become meaningless or can create ignorant ``chemophobia.''
   But environmentalists counter that people have the right to know
what is in the products they buy, around their neighborhoods and on
their job site.
   Consumers, randomly approached while shopping, generally say
that although they don't always pay attention to the signs, they're
glad the information is there.
   ``I think it's a good idea,'' said Charles Perry, shopping
recently in a downtown Fresno drugstore. ``A lot of people buy
things just because people tell them it's good without reading
what's in it. It's best you read for yourself and see what's in a
product.''
   Proposition 65 required the governor to issue a list of
chemicals that cause cancer or reproductive harm. One year after a
chemical goes on the list, businesses must give anyone exposed to
the chemical ``clear and reasonable warning.''
   The list now has 307 chemicals and compounds. The state is
required to add chemicals to the list as new information arises.
Gov. George Deukmejian created an advisory panel to review
chemicals and recommend them for the list at least annually.
   Because the initiative did not specify how companies should warn
people, the state Health and Welfare Agency issued regulations in
February 1988 that said warnings could consist of labels on
products, signs in stores or menus of restaurants. It also called
for ``a system of signs, public advertising identifying the system
and toll-free information services.''
   The regulations exempt food, drug, cosmetic and medical-device
products regulated under state and federal safety laws.
   Consequently, consumers have not found warning labels on the
thousands of individual products in grocery stores, hardward stores
and other businesses. Instead, most stores have a general warning
near the door covering their entire products.
   Grocery Manufacturers Association spokesman Jeffrey Nedelman
said the warnings have little if any effect on consumers. He said
warnings on alcohol have not stopped people from drinking.
   His organization released a report a year ago by the Hudson
Institute, a policy research firm in Indianapolis, that concluded
the Proposition 65 warnings ``will not provide consumers with
relevant or usable information about carcinogens and reproductive
toxins.''
   The report said if food products are labeled individually,
``consumers' confusion may well undermine confidence in the federal
regulatory process and create havoc in the marketplace.''
   Scientists for the Toxics Awareness Project of the California
Business Roundtable say Proposition 65 had contributed to emotional
talk about toxics that isn't always scientifically based.
   ``People are scared, frightened, mainly because they do not
understand what makes chemicals harmful,'' said Alice Ottoboni, a
retired toxicologist for the state and a member of the project.
``Most people think if a chemical is toxic in a small amount, it is
toxic in every amount.''
   ``Labeling without informed labeling, I don't think informs the
public,'' says Allen Verstuyft of Chevron Research Co. ``Just to
tell somebody a chemical is there without education is
meaningless.''
   Paul Van Dyke of Campaign California, one of the environmental
groups backing Proposition 65, said some people won't read
anything, no matter how it's presented. But others are information
seekers, he said.
   ``These are people who need information and have a right to
it,'' he said. ``We've never seen a proliferation of warnings as
being particularly dangerous. We would rather see that left to the
individual and not have regulators censor information.''
   Pedro Mayor of Los Angeles, shopping recently at a supermarket
in Glendale, said his buying habits have changed since Proposition
65. ``If I buy grapes or apples now I make sure they are clean,
that they don't have pesticides,'' he said.
   Mayor said he has also noticed benefits from Proposition 65 at
Hughes Aircraft, where he works. ``They have a lot of warnings.
They post them all over. We use a lot of chemical coatings in
aerospace,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Most American homes have smoke detectors, but
as many as half of them are useless because the batteries are old,
missing or have been ripped out by residents who can't stand the
noise, fire officials say.
   The number of homes in the United States that have detectors has
increased during the last decade from 22 percent to 80 percent.
   ``The problem is, we also estimate ... that probably as much as
50 percent of those detectors don't work,'' said Jim Estepp,
president of the International Association of Fire Chiefs.
   ``Sometimes it gets very discouraging. We have the worst fire
loss record of any country in the industrialized world.''
   The organization is pushing a national fire safety awareness
campaign called ``Change Your Clock, Change Your Battery,'' asking
people to make a habit of changing smoke detector batteries when
they change clocks from daylight-saving time each year.
   Daylight-saving time ends at 2 a.m. Sunday.
   ``The simple act of changing the batteries in smoke detectors is
the single most easy and accessible way of making a difference in
the number of deaths and injuries caused by fire,'' said Estepp,
who is also chief of the Prince George's County, Md., fire
department.
   About 1,500 departments across the country will join in the
battery-changing campaign this weekend.
   According to figures compiled by the organization, more than
500,000 residential fires occur in the United States each year,
killing nearly 6,000 people and causing serious injuries for
130,000.
   Estepp said the number of fire-related deaths went down as smoke
detectors took hold in the United States in the early 1980s. But in
recent years, the number of deaths leveled off and actually
increased in 1988.
   Fire officials attribute the trend in large part to smoke alarm
neglect.
   Estepp recalled a house fire in his own jurisdiction this year
in which a 16-year-old boy died in a fire that started when his
twin brother fell asleep after putting grease on the stove to cook
French fries.
   ``They had taken the smoke detectors down to replace the
batteries and never put them back up,'' Estepp said. ``You can
repeat that scenario just about every day.''
   This week, after a St. Louis woman and her son died in a house
fire, relatives told authorities she had disconnected the smoke
alarm because of the chirping noise it made as the batteries wore
down.

   Members of Congress are calling on Americans

of hostage Terry Anderson's fifth birthday in captivity.
   ``They will not and should not be forgotten,'' Senate Republican
leader Bob Dole said. ``We're asking ... that we take action to

   President Bush has signed a congressional resolution proclaiming
Friday, Anderson's 42nd birthday, as National Hostage Awareness Day.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, was seized March 16, 1985. He is the longest-held hostage.
   Other American hostages are Thomas Sutherland, Frank H. Reed,
Joseph J. Cicippio, Edwin A. Tracy, Jesse J. Turner, Alann B. Steen
and Robert B. Polhill.
   Former hostages and relatives of those still held will

<NOTE>D'Amato Mentioned Cases to Giuliani Out of `Concern'</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato says he was merely
passing on his ``concern'' for the prosecutor's office when he
approached U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani in 1984 and 1985 on
behalf of people representing two organized crime figures.
   ``I didn't intercede, I never interceded,'' D'Amato, R-N.Y.,
said in a telephone interview Wednesday. ``I just passed on a
concern. ... I never asked Giuliani to do anything as it related to
any matter. Never. And he says that.''
   D'Amato was responding to a report in the Village Voice that he
had called Giuliani in 1984 to support a sentence reduction for
jailed mobster Mario Gigante.
   Months later, the Voice said, D'Amato asked Giuliani to review
minor charges against Paul Castellano, an alleged Gambino crime
family boss who was later murdered.
   But D'Amato said he never mentioned a specific case in the
latter conversation, and that he was was only passing on the remark
of a lawyer who said he had information that might be
``embarrassing'' to Giuliani's office.
   Asked who the lawyer was, D'Amato said, ``I believe, I believe
it was Roy Cohn.''
   Cohn, who died in 1986, won notoriety in the 1950s as the grand
inquisitor of Sen. Joseph McCarthy's communist-hunting committee.
Later, in private practice, Cohn represented a number of organized
crime figures, including Castellano.
   Giuliani, who resigned as U.S. Attorney to run for mayor in New
York City, said Wednesday that Castellano's name never came up in
the conversation with D'Amato.
   ``Nobody was ever identified,'' he said. ``(D'Amato) talked
about murder counts ... being that a lawyer was concerned that the
U.S. attorney's office would lose the case because although the
person was guilty of the other things the murder counts would not
be substantiated.''
   Giuliani told the New York Daily News he had concluded D'Amato
was referring to the Castellano case. He also said he told D'Amato
``this was not the way to communicate information to me.''

<HEAD>Israel: Arafat Still Involved in Terror Attacks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICOLAS B. TATRO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel, at odds with Washington over a PLO role
in peace talks, has issued a report claiming Yasser Arafat's
faction ordered 12 attacks on Israeli civilians since the PLO chief
disavowed terrorism in December.
   Groups affiliated with the Palestine Liberation Organization
carried out 18 infiltrations or rocket attacks across Israel's
borders in the same period, the report said.
   Yigal Carmon, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's anti-terror
adviser, prepared the report and provided a copy to The Associated
Press on Wednesday.
   In his report, Carmon said the attacks ``are a violation of the
commitment Arafat gave to the United States and shows he can't be
trusted and that you can't do business with him.''
   He urged the United States to ``suspend the dialogue temporarily
until Arafat keeps his commitments.''
   The report comes as Israel and the United States haggle over
peace moves, especially the possible involvement of the PLO in
talks.
   Israel defines the PLO as a terrorist organization and refuses
to deal with it. It has strongly objected to the U.S. dialogue with
the PLO, which began 10 months ago when Arafat renounced terrorism
and said he recognized Israel.
   The Israeli report noted that Thomas Pickering, then the U.S.
ambassador, gave Israel a pledge a day after the U.S.-PLO talks
began Dec. 15 in Tunis that ``no American administration can
sustain the dialogue if terrorism continues by the PLO or any of
its factions.''
   Washington told Israel it expected the PLO to condemn any act of
terror and to discipline the guerrillas responsible, Carmon's
report said, and added:
   ``Not only has the PLO failed to fulfill these requirements, but
Arafat's own Fatah organization in particular has itself engaged in
terrorist acts ... and it has, furthermore, encouraged and lauded
these attacks even in the midst of these talks.''
   Carmon's report said security agents uncovered a 10-member cell
in April based near Jenin in the West Bank whose members were
recruited by the Force 17 unit of Fatah, Arafat's guerrilla wing,
in Amman, Jordan in 1987-88 and ordered to carry out attacks in
Israel.
   It blamed the cell for firebombings of two cars in northern
Israel and a hand grenade attack on a commuter bus in February and
March 1989, none of which caused casualties.
   The report said a second group linked to Force 17, an elite unit
led by Mahmoud Al Natur _ an Arafat aide known as Abu Tayyib _ was
blamed for seven bombings in the Tel Aviv-Petah Tikva area from
March through June. Another explosion in the West Bank wounded a
bomber.
   Two other bombings were attributed to an operation called
Western Sector, which the report said was under Arafat's personal
command. One wounded a Jewish cemetery worker.
   Sources said one reason U.S. officials remain unconvinced by
Israeli claims of Fatah involvement is that they are based on
interrogations. The credibility of such information was diminished
after a 1987 investigation revealed the use of torture by the Shin
Bet security service.
   Carmon said PLO factions under Arafat's umbrella were
responsible for nine attacks across the border in the past 10
months, many aimed at settlements near Lebanon, in which no
civilian casualties were reported. He said the other raids were by
pro-Syrian groups opposed to Arafat.
   Between Dec. 15 and Oct. 1, the report said, 99 alleged Arab
collaborators were killed by strike committees directed by the
PLO's ``unified command'' in the occupied lands.
   Israeli security sources said Wednesday they had found a
two-page, handwritten letter from a Fatah official ordering a Gaza
Strip activist to carry out assassinations. It was dated Aug. 18
and signed ``Halim,'' a code name used by a Force 17 official in
Amman, they said.
   The activist, identified as Hamdi Sheik Khalil, was arrested
Sept. 19. His lawyer said no formal charges had been filed.
   According to the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
the letter ordered the killings to be done in the name of the
Revolutionary Eagles in order to disguise PLO involvement. The
group has claimed responsibility for killing Kamal Wahidi, a senior
Gaza City official suspected of collaborating with Israel.

   The dollar edged up against the Japanese yen
Thursday, while the key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose
moderately.
   The dollar ended at 141.90 yen, up 0.35 yen from the previous
day's 141.55-yen finish. The currency started trading at 141.60
yen, and moved between 141.50 yen and 141.90 yen.
   The 250-issue Nikkei Stock Average bounced back and rose by
236.09 points, or 0.67 percent, to end at 35,678.49. It had lost
84.15 points Wednesday.
   The dollar moved little in Tokyo before the release of the U.S.
gross national product figures for the third quarter, due out later
Thursday, traders said.
   Traders expected the figure to be about 2.5 percent, the figure
registered in the second quarter, according to a Bank of Tokyo
trader, who spoke anonymously.
   If the figure stays about the same, the market environment would
not change much, another trader with a major commercial bank said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   On the stock exchange, dealers attributed the Nikkei index's
rebound to the yen's stability on the foreign exchange market.
   ``Japanese investors regained their buying incentives after the
last two days of falls, and picked up issues whose prices had
fallen,'' said Yoshio Shimoyama, a senior dealer with Nikko
Securities.
   He said participation by some major financial institutions also
reassured other investors and helped the index recover.

<HEAD>Man Kills Brother in Argument Over Care for Dying Mother</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man who had traveled more than 2,000
miles to help comfort his dying mother was shot to death by his
brother after they argued about how to care for her, police said.
   The battle began when Charles Barber and his wife arrived from
Las Vegas two weeks ago, police said. It ended Wednesday when Larry
Barber gunned his brother down in their mother's laundry room,
according to authorities.
   ``It was just a constant argument,'' Police Sgt. Sam Leffingwell
said. ``Charles was caring for the mother and had to get up every
four hours to tend to her.''
   Police said Larry Barber had a drinking problem and did little
to help.
   The shooting occurred about 5:30 a.m. after Charles Barber told
his brother he was tired of arguing and would return to Nevada,
police said.
   Charles was in the laundry room preparing to pack his bags when
his brother entered with a shotgun and fired, Leffingwell said.
   Larry Barber, 53, called police to report the shooting and
surrendered when officers arrived. His 51-year-old brother was dead
at the scene.
   Their mother, Maude P. Barber, suffers with cancer and lapses in
and out of comas. She was unaware of the shooting, Leffingwell said.
   Barber pleaded innocent to first-degree murder, and was ordered
held without bond. He asked for a court-appointed attorney.
   Wednesday's argument began about 2:30 a.m. The brothers stopped
for a short period but resumed the argument, which escalated to the
shooting, Leffingwell said.
   ``Charles said he and his wife were going to leave and get out
of this mess. Larry went upstairs, got a 12-gauge shotgun and shot
Charles in the front lower part of the chest,'' said Leffingwell.
   Leffingwell said officers interviewed Charles Barber's wife and
11-year-old son, who witnessed the shooting.

<TEXT>
   Critic and novelist Mary McCarthy, whose ``ice
clear'' observations of politics and literature placed her among
America's literary giants, has died. She was 77.
   Miss McCarthy died of cancer Wednesday at New York Hospital,
said Dixie Sheridan, spokeswoman for the author's alma mater,
Vassar College in Poughkeepsie.
   Called ``our first lady of letters'' by Norman Mailer, Miss
McCarthy first made her mark among the brawling New York
intellectuals of the 1930s, writing scathing literary and
theatrical reviews for ``The Nation'' and ``Partisan Review.''
   She reached a wider audience in 1963 with her spicy best-selling
novel ``The Group,'' chronicling the lives of eight women who
graduated from college in the 1930s.
   Her numerous awards including membership in the American Academy
of Arts and Letters and the National Institute of Arts and Letters,
two Guggenheim Fellowships, the National Medal for Literature, and
the Horizon Prize.
   She was the owner of a ``wholly destructive critical mind,''
possessed of an ``unerring ability to spot the hidden weakness or
inconsistency in any literary effort and every person,'' said
writer Alfred Kazin.
   ``There was a dedication to the art of living as well as to the
art of writing,'' said essayist Elizabeth Hardwick, a close friend.
``I loved her not only as a writer but as a person. She was into
all the things that go into good living _ making homes and cooking
and being enormously hospitable and having friendships that lasted
for decades.''
   She also was capable of devastating acerbity. She provoked a
celebrated literary feud with Lillian Hellman by declaring, on
national television, ``Everything she writes is a lie, including
`and' and `the.'''
   Miss Hellman sued for libel, but died in 1984 before the suit
reached a trial, which Miss McCarthy eagerly had sought.
   To the late poet Robert Lowell, Miss McCarthy was ``rash to
awkwardness,'' blurting ``ice clear'' sentences above the ``mundane
gossip and still more mundane virtue of her colleagues.''
   With her keen eye for detail, ruthless wit and deep insight,
Miss McCarthy for decades was regarded the ultimate highbrow of New
York radical and intellectual circles.
   She wrote about sexual freedom in the 1930s, radicalism in the
'40s and '50s, Vietnam and social and moral upheaval in the '60s,
Watergate and terrorism in the '70s. She was among the first
leftists to denounce Stalinism in the 1940s, and reported on the
Vietnam War from Saigon and Hanoi for the New York Review of Books.
   Miss McCarthy was born in Seattle in 1912 to Roy and Therese
McCarthy, who died within a day of each other during the 1918 flu
epidemic.
   Mary and three younger brothers were entrusted to an aunt and
uncle in Minneapolis. She later wrote that they dressed them like
paupers, fed them a diet of root vegetables, forbade reading and
taped their mouths shut at night ``to prevent mouth breathing.''
   She recounted her sordid childhood in the 1957 ``Memories of a
Catholic Girlhood,'' considered a landmark in autobiographical
writing.
   ``How I Grew,'' published in 1987 as a sequel, described her
rescue at age 11 by grandparents who took her to Tacoma, Wash.
   She married her first husband, Harold Johnsrud, one week after
graduating from Vassar in 1933. The marriage was brief and in 1938,
Miss McCarthy married her professor, the eminent critic Edmund
Wilson. They had one son, Reuel, before a bitter divorce in which
each accused the other of battery. Her third husband was Bowden
Broadwater.
   She is survived by her fourth husband, James West, and her son.
   Her drama reviews for the ``Partisan Review'' set ``the kind of
standards for the theater that you would apply to T.S. Eliot and
James Joyce,'' said Steven Marcus, associate editor of the magazine
and English professor at Columbia University. ``She really treated
the theater as literature. A lousy Broadway play, she would call a
lousy Broadway play.''
   She was among the last of the ``Partisan Review'' literati of
the 1930s and '40s, a group that included Wilson, Lowell, Hannah
Arendt, and poet Elizabeth Bishop, all of whom she survived.
   Marcus said that while her novels ``were not great works of
fiction,'' her non-fiction works were brilliant.
   ``They seemed shocking at the time, but that wears off and what
remains in fact is plain honesty, genuine honesty,'' he said.
   ``Mary McCarthy believed in the facts,'' said Thomas Mallon,
professor of English at Vassar. ``Even her fiction was accurate
right down to the labels on people's clothes as well as the
ideology in their heads.''
   ``Sometimes we winced for her because she did things in a way
that she wouldn't cut any corners,'' said poet James Merrill.
   Miss McCarthy moved to Paris in 1962 and divided her time
between there and a home in Castine, Maine. A private funeral was
planned in Castine for next week.

<HEAD>Rebel Offensive Leaves Six Dead, Another Extradition Ordered</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leftist guerrillas stormed two
northeastern towns then abandoned them, leaving at least six people
dead in Colombia's worst rebel violence in two years.
   The attacks Wednesday by the National Liberation Army, a
pro-Cuban guerilla group, apparently were unrelated to the
government's war against drug traffickers, now entering its 10th
week.
   The army has claimed for seven years, without producing proof,
that some leftist guerrillas and drug traffickers work in tandem.
   The government pressed ahead with the drug war Wednesday,
notifying an alleged member of the Medellin cocaine cartel that he
was being extradited to the United States and taking steps to
protect presidential candidates from violence by traffickers.
   According to TV Hoy, the government notified Jose Rafael Abello
Silva, 34, of his impending extradition. Police have said Abello is
the fourth most important figure in the Medellin cartel, in charge
of its activities on Colombia's Atlantic coast.
   Abello, also known by his alias, ``The Monkey,'' was arrested
Oct. 10 in Bogota and faces a charge by an Oklahoma federal court
of conspiracy to distribute cocaine.
   According to President Virgilio Barco's extradition decree,
Abello has five days to appeal the extradition.
   The Barco government has extradited four accused drug
traffickers to the United States since it launched the crackdown in
mid-August after the assassination of leading presidential
candidate Luis Carlos Galan.
   Suspected traffickers have responded to the crackdown with a
wave of bombings and assassinations.
   Defense Minister Oscar Botero announced Wednesday that the
discharge of more than 18,000 soldiers was being delayed so they
could provide security for presidential candidates. The soldiers'
service had been scheduled to end this month. About 80,000
Colombians are enlisted in the army.
   The soldiers will be used in operations before, during and after
the presidential elections next May, Botero told reporters. His
comments were broadcast by TV Hoy.
   The plan reportedly will cost the government more than $7
million.
   About 100 guerrillas invaded the towns of Cachira and La Vega in
the state of Norte de Santander early Wednesday, the army's 2nd
division reported.
   The heaviest attack, by about 60 men and women, was at 1 a.m. in
Cachira, a town of 15,000 people about 250 miles northeast of
Bogota. The guerrillas destroyed a police station with mortar
shells and opened fire on police officers with automatic weapons.
   Two policemen were killed and another seven injured during five
hours of fighting in the town, an army communique said.
   An hour after the assault on Cachira began, another group of 40
rebels invaded La Vega, 15 miles away, and tried to overrun the
police station there. Two policemen were wounded in the seven-hour
battle.
   One guerrilla died as the attackers fled the town of 5,000
people into the mountains, the army communique said.
   Guerrillas also ambushed police sent to reinforce the
beleaguered battalion in La Vega. Three officers died in an attack
along a dirt road outside town.
   The rebel attacks were the bloodiest since 1987, when guerrillas
raided an average of one town a week and more than 50 people were
killed during one month of fighting.
   The national radio chain, Caracol, said two other leftist
groups, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia and the People's
Liberation Army also participated in Wednesday's attacks. The army
could not confirm the report.
   The National Liberation Army, believed to have 2,000 combatants,
was organized in 1960 and bases its doctrine on the teachings of
Cuban President Fidel Castro.
   Headed by a defrocked Catholic priest, Manuel Perez, the group
is the most active of Colombia's six guerrilla organizations. It
swore recently it would never negotiate with the government.

   Television projects based on San Francisco's
killer earthquake are already in the works, but some producers say
a TV show about the devastation would be exploitive.
   ABC and CBS said Wednesday they are considering television shows
about the Oct. 17 catastrophe. The death toll Wednesday stood at
63, and damage estimates have reached $10 billion.
   ``We are in the earliest stages of development'' of an
earthquake-related production, ABC spokesman Bob Wright said.
Another ABC spokesman said the network had already commissioned the
project with a producer.
   Craig Hoffman, a CBS spokesman, said: ``People have been
contacting us to determine the network's interest in doing a
project but no decision has been made either way.''
   NBC spokeswoman Sue Binford said she was unaware of any San
Francisco earthquake-inspired movie in the works at her network.
   TV producer David Wolper has had some ``serious discussions''
about making a quake show, said Auriel Sanderson, an assistant to
Wolper. Wolper was out of town and could not be reached for
comment, she said.
   Irwin Allen, producer of several disaster-related movies, said
he is thinking about developing a quake project.
   ``We're considering it, but we just completed a script for CBS
on Hurricane Hugo,'' Allen said. ``The (earthquake) is on the desk,
and we're surely thinking of it, but the hurricane comes first.''
   Some producers said such a program would not be a good idea.
   ``We are not doing anything on it,'' said Lindy DeKoben, vice
president of creative affairs for the Lansburg Co., which
specializes in ``fact-based'' movies such as ``Quiet Victory: The
Charlie Wedemeyer Story'' and ``The Ryan White Story.''
   ``We don't find anything redeeming in the story and a movie
would only exploit the misfortunes of others,'' DeKoben said.
   Marcy Gross, co-owner of Gross Weston Productions, makers of ``I
Love You Perfect'' and ``The Billionaire Boys Club,'' doubted that
a television movie based on the earthquake could serve a purpose.
   ``It's too soon and too painful,'' Gross said. ``I wouldn't want
to intrude on anybody's tragedy. ... As much as we love to sell
shows and we like to do anything that's current, I think we'd be
intruding on people's pain.''
   Such a program likely would include the story Julio Berumen, the
6-year-old whose right leg was amputated above the knee when he was
rescued from the wreckage of Interstate 880 in Oakland. Rescuers
had to cut through his mother's body to reach him.
   Another likely subject would be Buck Helm, who survived for 90
hours in the I-880 rubble, or a firefighter such as Gerry Shannon,
who grabbed a woman pinned in her blazing Marina district apartment
as a gas leak threatened to set off an explosion.

<HEAD>American U.N. Adviser Says Nicaragua's Campaign Fair</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   U.N. poll watcher Elliot Richardson says
Nicaragua is headed for ``a free, fair and honest election,''
despite the State Department's stated fear that the leftist
Sandinista government will rig the vote.
   Richardson, a former U.S. attorney general, is Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar's personal representative for monitoring
the campaign for Nicaragua's Feb. 25 presidential and national
assembly elections.
   He briefed reporters Wednesday before reporting to Perez de
Cuellar on his weekend talks in Nicaragua with President Daniel
Ortega and members of the Supreme Electoral Council, which
interprets the election laws.
   ``The council has been performing in a conscientious, fair and
impartial manner,'' Richardson said.
   ``It is certainly my impression, and I think that I speak for
all of us representing the United Nations in Nicaragua, that the
goal of a free, fair and honest election is being taken seriously
by all those concerned, in the government, in the parties, and
among the people,'' he said.
   On Monday, U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering said the State
Department fears the ruling Sandinistas are trying to rig
Nicaragua's election and cited ``the reported presence of armed
soldiers at Nicaraguan voter registration centers.''
   Richardson's U.N. team had observers at many polling places
during the four Sundays in October on which voters registered and
he said ``I cannot tell you that they did not see any'' soldiers or
guards.
   However, he said, no one complained to him about intimidation:
``This is not a matter that has been brought to my attention.''
   The Sandinista government reported several attacks on polling
places over the weekend that it blamed on U.S.-backed Contra rebels.
   It accused the rebels, to whom Washington now provides only
non-lethal aid, of trying to disrupt the voting process.
   Richardson served as attorney general under President Richard
Nixon, and is remembered for his refusal to fire Watergate special
prosecutor Archibald Cox on the orders of the White House on Oct.
10, 1973.
   He resigned rather than carry out the order.

<TEXT>
   A day after being sentenced to 72 hours in
jail, Zsa Zsa Gabor ridiculed the judge as needing ``a blood
transfusion'' and derided the prosecutor as enjoying the trial's
circuslike atmosphere more than she did.
   During an appearance Wednesday night on Fox TV's ``A Current
Affair,'' the actress was asked if she were at all repentant for
slapping Beverly Hills Police Officer Paul Kramer on June 14.
   ``For what?'' she replied. ``That I was beaten half to death by
a 6-foot-4, macho policeman because my driver's license had
expired? I was defending myself. I think all of Beverly Hills owes
me an apology. I tried to fight for the battered woman.''
   A jury convicted Miss Gabor on Sept. 29 of misdemeanor charges
of battery on a police officer, driving without a valid driver's
license and having an open container of alcohol in her car.
   The former Hungarian beauty queen, believed to be at least in
her mid-60s, was acquitted of failing to obey an officer.
   On Tuesday, Municipal Court Judge Charles Rubin ordered her to
serve the jail time by Dec. 29, but gave her the option of
reporting to any jail in Los Angeles County.
   During her confinement, the star of such B-movies as ``Picture
Mommy Dead'' and ``Queen of Outer Space'' will have to trade in her
designer gowns for a jail-issued cotton shift or pantsuit and will
forsake her luxurious home for an 8-by-10-foot concrete cell with a
bed, sink and toilet.
   Although authorities promised no special privileges, Miss
Gabor's celebrity will allow her to be segregated from other
prisoners.
   ``Anytime we have an inmate who is recognizable, we separate
them from the general population for their own safety,'' said
sheriff's Lt. Joe Surgent, head of operations for Sybil Brand
Institute, the county's main jail for women. ``People with that
kind of notoriety can be preyed upon. I imagine there are some
people who don't like Zsa Zsa Gabor.''
   The judge also ordered Miss Gabor to pay $12,937.50 in fines and
restitution and perform 120 hours of community service in a women's
homeless shelter.
   She also was ordered to be interviewed by a psychiatrist and
refrain from driving until she gets her real age on her driver's
license. Court documents said she was 66. During the trial, Miss
Gabor claimed the license was stolen and altered by someone else.
   ``Maybe I should have my head examined,'' she said on ``A
Current Affair.'' ``He's right. If I tried to fight City Hall and
the Beverly Hills police, a woman should have her head examined.''
   Miss Gabor seemed unaffected by Rubin chastising her for
comments made to reporters during the trial. About Rubin, she said:
``After he got through with the sentencing, he looked like he
needed a blood transfusion.''
   As for District Attorney Ira Reiner, she said: ``He's not on my
hit list. He's not good enough for my hit list. ... This man is not
equal to me.''
   She said both men ``loved'' the publicity surrounding the case.
   ``They milked it. I don't need it,'' she said. ``I'm a rich
woman. I don't need these people, they needed me.''

<HEAD>Study Finds 1980s School Reform Produced Only ``Modest'' Gains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE MITGANG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   States have made only modest gains toward school
reform this decade, and few are heeding calls to shift more power
and responsibility to local schools, a report says.
   The report, ``The Progress of Reform: An Appraisal of State
Education Initiatives,'' found that only a few states such as
Washington, Arkansas, Maine and Massachusetts have programs to
encourage local districts to find creative ways of improving
classroom instruction.
   The study, released Wednesday, concluded that state efforts
since 1983, when the federal report ``A Nation at Risk'' heralded
the school reform movement, generally have lacked coherence.
   It suggested that future items on the reform agenda such as more
equitable distribution of school funds to poorer districts and
giving teachers and parents more authority in school governance
will be dauntingly difficult.
   ``If we're going to get those kinds of things, people are going
to have to be willing to stay at it for a long time,'' said William
A. Firestone, associate professor of education at Rutgers
University and co-author of the report.
   The study was produced by the Center for Policy Research in
Education, a consortium of the Eagleton Institute of Politics at
Rutgers, Michigan State University school of education, the
Stanford University school of education, and the University of
Wisconsin-Madison Center for Education Research.
   ``High school curricula are more academically oriented,
standards for entering the teaching profession are more selective,
teachers' salaries are higher and state and local governments have
boosted educational funding,'' the report said.
   But ``there are still doubts about the rigor and challenge of
some of the new courses in academic subjects, the impact of reform
on at-risk students, the quality of teachers and teaching and the
equitable funding of schools.''
   Educators have said lately that the current reform movement
passed through a ``first wave'' from 1982-86 during which states
tightened teacher certification standards, boosted graduation
requirements, and required students to pass more tests and
demonstrate competency.
   Since then, reformers have spoken of a ``second wave'' of
educational improvements, often called ``restructuring,'' during
which schools themselves are being given more freedom to innovate
and teachers and parents are being made more equal partners with
administrators in school governance.
   President Bush endorsed many of those ``second wave'' ideas at
last month's ``education summit'' with the nation's governors.
   But this latest study suggests that those principles remains
wishful thinking in most states.
   While a few pioneering districts such as Rochester, N.Y.,
Cincinnati, and Dade County, Fla., have local restructuring
strategies, ``states are still enacting policies more
characteristic of the first wave of reform,'' according to the
report.
   ``States are exhibiting no clear shift in direction from the
first wave of reform to the second,'' the report said.
   Its other authors were Susan H. Furhrman, professor of policy at
Eagleton, and Michael W. Kirst, an education professor at Stanford.

<HEAD>Dollar, Stocks Up In Tokyo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar edged up against the Japanese yen today,
while the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index bounced back moderately.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues regained 236.09
points, or 0.67 percent, to 35,678.49. It had lost 84.15 points
Wednesday.
   The dollar closed at 141.90 yen, up 0.35 yen from Wednesday's
close of 141.55 yen. It started trading at 141.60 yen and rose
while moving between 141.50 yen and 141.90 yen.
   ``The currency market had little movement today,'' said a Bank
of Tokyo trader, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Traders bought the yen against the dollar during earlier
trading, which kept the dollar at around its opening rate, but the
dollar rose back later as investors sold West German marks and
bought the U.S. unit for technical adjustments, he said.
   The U.S. currency rose further shortly before the end of trading
as market players tried to increase their dollar holdings for their
position adjustments, the trader added.
   Despite ups and downs in the dollar-yen rate, the dollar has
become less attractive to investors due to the U.S. monetary policy
of keeping its interest rate moderately low, traders said.
   On the stock exchange, the index rose steadily as the yen's
stability reassured market players and encouraged their buying
incentives, stock dealers said.
   The Nikkei lost more than 140 points in the last two days.
   Core industry issues such as railways and construction were
among the recent winners, which have become leading issues of the
market.
   Trading was fairly active today, with first section volume
estimated at 850 million shares, down, however, from Wednesday's 1
billion.
   Meanwhile, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. shares fell
further to 1.35 million yen, yet another low.

   Anchor Tom Brokaw apologized _ sort of _ to New
Yorkers for a remark he made last week on the ``NBC Nightly News.''
   Brokaw had complimented San Francisco motorists on Oct. 18, the
day after the earthquake, for their courtesy to one another despite
the malfunction of traffic lights.
   But he said that would never happen in the city where he himself
lives and works.
   ``In New York City, not a chance,'' Brokaw said.
   Mayor Edward I. Koch let Brokaw know of his disapproval about
the remark, said the New York Post in today's editions.
   So in a ``personal note'' on Wednesday night's broadcast, Brokaw
reminded viewers about his remark, and added:
   ``Well, that angered a lot of my fellow New Yorkers, who
reminded me of how smoothly traffic moved in this city during the
big power blackouts. And they were right. I was wrong.
   ``Traffic does move a lot better here when the traffic lights
don't work,'' Brokaw said.

<TEXT>
   The dollar rose in early European trading today,
and currency dealers attributed it to Wednesday's remarks by U.S.
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan.
   Gold prices were mixed.
   The dollar's rise began in New York late Wednesday following
Greenspan's statements indicating the Fed remains concerned about
inflation in the United States. The remarks reinforced market
perceptions that the Fed won't ease monetary policy in the near
future, dealers said.
   They said the market was, however, waiting for U.S. third
quarter gross national product preliminary figures to be released
last Thursday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 0.35 yen to a closing 141.90 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 141.71 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Wednesday:
   --1.8448 West German marks, up from 1.8410
   --1.6155 Swiss francs, up from 1.6129
   --6.2638 French francs, up from 6.2520
   --2.0825 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0740
   --1,352.00 Italian lire, up from 1,350.00
   --$1.1750 Canadian, up from $1.1745
   In London, it cost $1.6067 to buy one pound, slightly cheaper
for buyers than $1.6090 late Wednesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $367.50 a troy ounce,
compared with late Wednesday's $368.25. At mid-morning, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $368.45.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $368.40 compared with $368.70 late
Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 11 cents to close at a bid
$368.74.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.11 a troy
ounce, unchanged from late Wednesday.

<HEAD>Eds: To ADD that verse on the cross among that which circulated at
prison, SUB graf 23, `Still more ... through Sluzew.' Picks up 24th, `Maj
says ...' ^An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tablet on a plain narrow cross tucked
away, almost hidden, in a corner of a cemetery on Warsaw's southern
outskirts bears chilling witness to Poland's torment during the
Stalinist years:
   ``In Mokotowski Prison, there was a shot in the back of the
head, and then a little horse brought us to Sluzew.''
   The unsigned verse and cross in Walbrzyska Street Cemetery mark
where an estimated 500 to 3,000 political prisoners were buried
after being executed or tortured to death at Mokotowski Prison
during the late 1940s and early 1950s.
   The prison is about three miles away from the Sluzew burial
ground.
   On a golden autumn day children play and men wash cars only a
few steps away from the cross in a parking lot where some of the
victims are thought to lie. Drab modern housing blocks stretch
along a small adjacent stream.
   Only a few curious visitors find their way to the cross, to lay
a flower or say a prayer.
   But now, four decades later, people are beginning to talk openly
about the midnight burials 40 years ago when Sluzew _ then a tiny
hamlet _ seemed a safe place to hide a shameful deed.
   And for the first time Saturday, the still unidentified victims
will have a funeral Mass said for them at nearby St. Catherine's
Church.
   The parish priest, the Rev. Jozef Maj, is leading the struggle
to lay bare the history of the executions and help families whose
loved ones may lie here.
   ``The victims were from the leading circles of Poland, the ones
who might have created centers of social support, who might have
formed an alternative leadership,'' he says of those killed by the
Kremlin-imposed Communist regime as it waged class war and
consolidated power in Poland after World War II.
   If the new Solidarity-led coalition government led by Prime
Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki is to establish its credibility, the
priest said, it can start by helping to find out the truth about
the killings.
   Indeed, the Mazowiecki government has shown great interest in
examining the dark post-war years in Poland, when the political
persecution Stalin practiced at home also found favor among the men
ruling eastern European countries under Soviet influence.
   Justice Minister Aleksander Bentkowski this month issued an
appeal for evidence of Stalinist-era crimes for his ministry to
investigate.
   A long-banned movie about the period, ``The Interrogation,'' is
now being released in state-owned cinemas. And state television
news this week broadcast Maj's story of the Walbrzyska Street
cemetery.
   The cemetery stands as a ``symbol of the martyrdom of Poles
during the Communist terror,'' says Malgorzata Shejnert, of the
Church-Social Committee for Homage to the Victims of the Terror of
the Authorities in the Years 1945-56.
   ``It also symbolizes the indestructability of memory.''
   The memory of the burials was kept alive by a few older
residents of the area.
   They say victims were brought by night in horse-drawn wagons and
buried just outside the new cemetery of St. Catherine's on
Walbrzyska Street. Maj said most of the burials took place between
1945 abnd 1951, but he has heard of one as late as autumn 1956.
   According to the local accounts, lime was poured on the bodies
and the ground was afterward leveled.
   ``After two years, there was no sign of a grave, of a body or
bones. That was the point of this method,'' Maj said.
   Further evidence of the burials came last year, when St.
Catherine's, one of the area's oldest churches, was cleaning out
its archives preparing for its 750th anniversary as a parish next
year.
   The archive keeper found letters from Maj's predecessor, Canon
Adam Wyrebowski, who had written to both the Ministry of Public
Security and the Rakowiecka Street prison about the burials in
unhallowed ground.
   Still more proof comes from poetry _ such as the verse on the
narrow cross in Sluzew _ that circulated among prisoners at
Mokotowski Prison.
   Maj says it is believed bodies were buried in what is now the
back section of the church's cemetery, expanded in 1959, in a
meadow leading down to the stream where the apartment blocks now
stand and around the city horserace track a few miles away.
   Already `people are coming to me, bringing their reports and
whatever different documents they possess,'' he said.
   Maj said he has also heard of such burial sites in Rawicz and
Wroclaw provinces, and there may be others.
   Maybe the number of victims' and some of their names will be
established said Mrs. Szejnert said on state TV. ``But even then,
the families will not find any remains, and the place where the
relatives rest will only be known inexactly.''

<HEAD>Quake Drill Canceled After Real Thing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Officials of the International Society for
Traumatic Stress Studies say a disaster drill planned here for
today has been canceled.
   Last week's earthquake prompted some 500 visiting psychiatrists
and experts to call off their long-planned ``experiential program
where people will be asked to act as victims.''
   Instead, a panel of psychiatric and disaster relief experts will
be host of an open discussion on the real-life emotional
aftershocks from the Oct. 17 quake.
   Yael Danieli, an Israeli psychologist and president of the
society, said Northern California is handling the quake in a
``typically American'' manner _ pushing ahead and not allowing it
to get in the the way of things like the World Series.
   ``It's wonderful how America keeps going, but there's a danger
in just forgetting about the quake,'' said Danieli, who has done
extensive research with Holocaust survivors. ``It's like people
gave themselves a week to deal with it, but never had a chance to
cry, to scream. Maybe they can blow off some steam at the World
Series.''

<TEXT>
   A tanker carrying more than 14 million
gallons of crude oil was anchored in Cook Inlet after it being
turned away from a refinery dock because it lacked a state-approved
oil spill contingency plan.
   The Unocal vessel, the SanSinena II, was bound for the
Tesoro-Alaska Petroleum Co. refinery when the state Department of
Environmental Conservation denied it permission to dock on Tuesday.
   Larry Dietrick, the department's environmental quality director,
said Unocal had been denied a variance that would allow the tanker
to load or unload in Cook Inlet.
   Cook Inlet and Prince William Sound have been the focus of state
Department of Environmental Conservation review since the March 24
grounding of the tanker Exxon Valdez. It caused the nation's
largest oil spill, with nearly 11 million gallons coating 1,000
miles of shoreline.
   Unocal had planned for the vessel to unload its cargo at the
refinery and then pick up Cook Inlet crude oil before returning to
California, said Joe Sautner, an environmental field officer for
the state.
   State law requires spill contingency plans for any vessel
carrying more than 420,000 gallons of oil, and the plans must be
for specific areas, Sautner said.
   Unocal submitted a plan for the tanker late Wednesday, but it
had not been reviewed, he said. State officials have up to 65 days
to review such plans. Although Unocal referred to plans submitted
in 1978 and 1984, those could not be found and would have expired
in three years, Sautner said.
   ``That plan will probably not get reviewed in time to solve this
situation in the immediate future,'' he said. ``The reason that we
can't do it really quickly is that we don't want to put ourselves
in a position of doing a quick review.''
   Unocal officials in Kenai and Anchorage could not be reached for
comment late Wednesday.
   Last week, department Commissioner Dennis Kelso announced that
all tanker owners, operators and charterers in Prince William Sound
would need to have state-approved spill response plans by Nov. 13.
   Following the Valdez grounding, the state announced that the
Cook Inlet tanker traffic would be re-examined. The department said
it would turn away tankers lacking appropriate spill contingency
plans.

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl today called
East Germany's new Communist leader, Egon Krenz, for a 20-minute
talk on the need to improve inter-German relations, officials
announced.
   ``The conversation took place in a businesslike and constructive
atmosphere,'' Hans Klein, federal information minister and Kohl's
chief spokesman, told reporters after the early morning call.
   Klein said the two German leaders ``underscored their interest
in a further development of inter-German relations and advancement
of practical cooperation.''
   It was agreed during the talk, the first-ever contact between
the two men leading the separate German states, that Kohl's chief
of staff, Rudolf Seiters, would travel to East Berlin soon to meet
with senior East German officials.
   Kohl on Tuesday said he had no objections to a summit meeting
with Krenz, as soon as both sides considered it advantageous.
   Krenz responded Wednesday by telling reporters in East Berlin
that he, too, was open to a summit, but that pressing domestic
problems had to be dealt with first.
   Krenz, 52, was named Communist Party chief on Oct. 18 to succeed
his ousted mentor, Erich Honecker.
   East Germany's state-run media have since embarked on a more
open course, and the Communist country's leaders now say they are
willing to discuss reform with groups including opposition
activists they have previously shunned.

<TEXT>
   Teachers, administrators and staffers in two
school districts called dial-a-porn, called information and called
collect to the tune of thousands of dollars in telephone misuse,
investigators were told.
   ``It's absolutely disgusting, people spending their time making
porn calls and baseball trivia calls,'' declared James F. Gill,
chairman of a commission investigating political patronage hiring
and other abuses in New York City schools.
   Misuse or waste amounted to 13 cents of every dollar spent on
telephone service in the two largely poor districts in East Harlem
and the Bronx, the commission said.
   Their personnel made at least $18,000 worth of calls on school
phones to dial-a-porn, sports, horoscope and gab lines, Amyjane
Rettew, a counsel for the commission, testified Wednesday.
   Records showed hundreds of calls, at 50 cents to $35 each, to
telephone lines like ``Erotic Fantasies,'' ``Dirty Joke,'' and
``Smut,'' she said.
   Rettew said irregularities ``leaped off the pages'' when
investigators _ who weren't particularly looking for telephone
misuse _ saw the telephone bills of the local boards.
   About $35,000 went down the drain because school personnel
called information instead of using a telephone directory and
$30,000 more was lost in penalties for late payment of telephone
bills, she said.
   An additional $6,500 was billed as collect or third-party-charge
calls, categories frowned upon or forbidden in Board of Education
policies.
   In a statement issued later in the day, schools acting
Chancellor Bernard Mecklowitz said he has directed the board's
business office to arrange for electronic blocks to prevent school
telephones from dialing the exchanges and area codes of chat lines.

   More Indian summer weather dawned today on much of the eastern
and central United States while snow fell in the Rockies.
   Sunny skies and strong southerly winds produced record highs
throughout much of the central United States on Wednesday, with
temperatures into the upper 70s as far north as the Canadian border.
   Afternoon highs of 77 degrees at Alpena, Mich., and 81 degrees
at St. Cloud, Minn., were the warmest on record so late in the
season for those two spots.
   Sunny skies also prevailed in the eastern states where afternoon
highs were mostly in the 70s.
   Wintry weather continued over parts of the West, with snow
spreading across Nevada into Utah, Colorado and Wyoming.
   Advisories for snow and blowing snow were posted for early today
for the mountains and valleys of Colorado and Utah.
   High winds swept the Southwest. On Wednesday, wind gusts reached
63 mph in the Mojave, Calif., 45 mph at Las Vegas and 43 mph at
Kingman, Ariz.
   Showers extended from southern and central California into Utah
and northern Arizona. A few showers and thunderstorms were
scattered across Florida, southern Texas, upper Michigan, New
Mexico and the northern Pacific Coast.

   The search for a gunman who killed a pregnant
woman and shot her husband ``narrowed down to a chosen few'' after
police got a description from the critically injured husband.
   Meanwhile, the couple's baby _ delivered by Caesarean section
several hours after the shooting and eight weeks premature _
struggled for life today.
   The city's attention has been riveted on the story of Charles
and Carol Stuart since the suburban couple was attacked Monday
night by a man who commandeered their car as they left a childbirth
class at an inner-city hospital.
   He demanded money and got keys and jewelry, but then opened fire
after demanding Stuart's wallet, police said.
   He shot Mrs. Stuart, 33, of Reading, in the head. She died
shortly after her son, Christopher, was delivered. The boy was
alive at Brigham and Women's Hospital, but officials refused to
further describe his condition.
   Stuart, 29, general manager in a fur store, spoke to police
Wednesday night though he was in critical condition with a gunshot
wound to the abdomen. In addition to filling in details of the
attack, he gave an excellent description of his attacker, said
police Superintendent Joseph V. Saia Jr.
   ``The list of suspects has been narrowed down to a chosen few,''
Saia said. ``As soon as his condition improves, we will go in with
our artists and come up with a composite drawing.''
   Also Wednesday, more than 400 people attended a memorial Mass
for Mrs. Stuart at Mission Church in the Mission Hill neighborhood
where the couple was shot.
   The Rev. Joseph Krastel said he didn't believe any of the
Stuarts' relatives attended the mass.
   ``We hope our prayers can console them,'' Krastel said, adding
that members of his congregation are increasingly troubled by
violenece in the area. ``Every week people in this neighborhood are
stabbed or shot. There's been a tremendous escalation of violence
here,'' he said.
   After the attack, Stuart called for help on a car telephone that
his wife, a lawyer, had installed after she got pregnant so she
could stay in close touch with her husband.
   Police originally thought the gunman shot the couple because he
spotted the mobile phone and thought that indicated they were
undercover police officers.
   After a 90-minute hospital interview with Stuart, detectives
changed the theory, The Boston Globe reported today, citing
unidentified sources. The husband told police the gunman said
``Five-O,'' street slang for police, after Stuart said he didn't
have a wallet.
   Investigators believe the gunman thought Stuart was refusing to
hand over his wallet because it contained a police badge, the Globe
said.
   As media attention focused on Mission Hill, some residents
suggested the interest was because the victims were white
professionals.
   ``There have been other people who've been murdered in this
neighborhood. People that I knew and that I cared about,'' said
Mission Hill resident Paul Everly. ``But not one of them has
brought out the police and you reporters like this one. What makes
this one demand so much attention?''
   ``It shows there is a double standard when violence reaches
beyond the urban area and beyond minorities,'' said Louis Elisa of
the Boston chapter of the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People.

<HEAD>Hormone Stimulates Blood Donations Before Surgery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A genetically engineered protein that stimulates
the body to make more blood may help people avoid transfusions by
allowing them to store several pints of their own blood before
planned surgery, according to a study.
   People make donations before surgery so they can use their own
blood if transfusions are needed. However, people frequently cannot
produce enough extra blood ahead of time to replace all that is
lost during the operation.
   The research shows that the hormone erythropoietin can stimulate
the body to make more red blood cells so people can make larger
donations for themselves.
   ``We have previously shown that if you ask people to store
significant amounts of blood for themselves over a short period of
time, about 40 percent are unable to do that. As you draw blood
out, they become anemic,'' said Dr. Lawrence T. Goodnough of Case
Western Reserve University in Cleveland.
   His research, published in today's New England Journal of
Medicine, found that people getting erythropoietin increased their
blood donations by 41 percent.
   The new treatment is a product of genetic engineering. The human
gene that oversees production of erythropoietin is inserted into
hamster tissue, which produces the human hormone in large
quantities.
   The protein was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration in June specifically for people suffering anemia
caused by kidney failure. However, doctors can also prescribe it
for other conditions.
   In the study, 47 patients at 12 hospitals were asked to try to
give up to 6 pints of blood during three weeks before elective
orthopedic surgery. They were randomly assigned to take
erythropoietin or placebos.
   Only one of 23 patients getting erythropoietin could give less
than 4 pints, compared with seven of 24 in the controlled group.
   Goodnough said the treatment before surgery may be especially
suitable for people who are small and have less blood to give and
for women, who are more prone than men to have anemia.
   Doctors frequently recommend self-donations so people can avoid
using blood from other people. While ordinary transfusions are
reasonably safe, recipients do run added risk of hepatitis or other
viruses as well as suffering adverse reactions to other people's
blood.

   ``Today'' show weatherman Willard Scott said he
has no doubt that co-host Jane Pauley will leave the show, but NBC
would only say an announcement is expected shortly.
   Scott said Wednesday he spoke with Pauley after her broadcast
and that she didn't specifically say she was leaving the show. She
left the impression, however, that, ``I'm so glad and the decision
is made,'' he said.
   Scott said Pauley told him that she'll be doing prime-time
specials for NBC News in the future.
   Pauley, who this month celebrated her 13th year on the morning
program, reportedly has been unhappy with recent changes made on
the program, including a Sept. 5 switch of newscasters in which
Deborah Norville took over John Palmer's job.
   ``I would have bet the family farm that she never was going to
leave,'' Scott said. ``But from what I saw today, I don't think
there's any question.''
   An NBC executive who requested anonymity confirmed that Pauley
will be doing prime-time news specials, but said she probably will
remain on ``Today'' until the end of the year.
   Pauley did not reply to a request for comment. She previously
has declined to discuss when and if she'll leave ``Today,'' saying
only that she will remain at NBC News, where her contract has two
years remaining.
   Pauley's agent, Ralph Mann, and Dick Ebersol, NBC News' vice
president for ``Today,'' did not return calls.

   Adnan Khashoggi, the indicted Saudi financier
who was confined to his apartment on $10 million bail, has been
granted a visit to California that his lawyer calls ``part
business, part pleasure.''
   While in California, Khashoggi's movements will continue to be
monitored by an electronic ankle bracelet as ordered by U.S.
District Judge John Keenan.
   The trip is an exception to travel restrictions attached to his
release on bail while he awaits a March trial on charges he helped
the late leader of the Philippines, Ferdinand Marcos, and his wife,
Imelda, defraud their national treasury.
   Khashoggi's itinerary includes eight nights, starting Friday, at
the exclusive Century Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles and five nights at
the home of his brother, Essam Khashoggi, in Santa Barbara.
   His attorney, Robert Morvillo, said in an Oct. 12 letter to
Keenan that Khashoggi's hotel room will be equipped with a personal
phone line to accommodate the monitoring device.
   Keenan granted permission for the trip in September.
   Morvillo said in an interview Wednesday that Khashoggi's stay in
Los Angeles will be ``part business, part pleasure.''
   He said Khashoggi would meet with one of his other attorneys to
discuss the status of civil lawsuits in which he is involved.
   Khashoggi was a fugitive after the indictment was brought in
October 1988. He was apprehended in April by Swiss authorities and
jailed in Switzerland until his extradition to New York in July.

<DATELINE>LANSING, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anti-abortion activists were bolstered
after the Michigan Senate approved a bill that would require
parental consent before girls 17 or younger could obtain abortions.
   The bill goes to the House for consideration, possibly next
week, after senators passed it Wednesday on a vote of 29-8.
   Backers of the bill feel they have the votes in the House,
although it's uncertain whether the House would vote to override an
expected veto by Democratic Gov. James Blanchard.
   ``We expect a very favorable vote in the House,'' said Barbara
Listing, president of the anti-abortion group Michigan Right to
Life. ``With such wide public support for a parental rights
measure, we fully expect our representatives to reflect the will of
the citizens of Michigan.''
   Howard Simon, executive director of the American Civil Liberties
Union in Michigan, criticized the measure.
   ``I hope the public isn't suckered into thinking that this is a
family rights bill,'' he said. ``The issue is forcing unwanted
pregnancies to term.''
   About 30 states have parental consent laws on abortion, and most
are tied up in court and not enforced. Both sides of the abortion
issue are watching progress of the Michigan legislation because it
is among the first anti-abortion bills acted upon since the U.S.
Supreme Court on July 3 gave states more power to restrict
abortions.
   Among several amendments the Senate rejected was one that would
have waived parental consent if a girl was the victim of rape or
incest.
   Democratic Sen. John Cherry said it was ``unbelievable'' that a
victim of incest or rape might be required to ask her attacker for
permission to abort his child. ``This bill is deficient,'' he said.
``It's shocking.''
   The legislation would require a girl age 17 or less to get one
parent's written consent to obtain an abortion. If consent were
refused or the girl couldn't discuss the matter with a parent, she
would be able to seek a juvenile court order allowing the abortion.
   The court would be required to grant a waiver of parental
consent if it determined the girl was mature enough to make the
decision or found ``the abortion would be in the best interests of
the minor.''
   Parental consent wouldn't be required in an emergency, where the
continued pregnancy would endanger the girl.

   A youth counselor died when he ran back into a
burning group home, apparently trying to rescue a boy he thought
was trapped, and police charged a former resident with murder and
arson in the fire.
   Peter Steiniger, 19, who left the home earlier this month when
he was charged with assaulting a different counselor, was arrested
after the fire Wednesday, police said.
   He was charged with murder, attempted murder and arson, said a
police spokesman, Officer Fred Weiner.
   The fire was started with a flammable liquid on the ground floor
of the Brooklyn group home, police said. Steiniger was seen at the
fire, said police and fire officials, and officials of the city's
Human Resources Administration, which ran the foster home for
abused and neglected youth.
   Witnesses told police they saw a young man break a window of the
home, pour a liquid inside and light a match. A two-gallon gasoline
can and a knife were found at the scene.
   Three counselors and six children living at the home escaped,
but 27-year-old counselor Terrance McGee ran back inside,
apparently under the mistaken impression that one boy was trapped.
   The front door slammed and locked in McGee, the Daily News said
in today's editions.
   ``We heard him screaming,'' said a 19-year-old resident, Bruce
Edwards, who helped others try to force open the door, but failed,
the News said.
   McGee was pronounced dead at Kings County Hospital of smoke
inhalation and burns.
   Steiniger had been arrested Oct. 12 for assaulting another youth
counselor at the home, said police Deputy Chief Joseph DeMartino.
   ``We believe he was angry at being evicted,'' DeMartino told
reporters.

<HEAD>Bhutto Government No-Confidence Motion to Open Nov. 1</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Assembly speaker
announced today that Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto will face a
no-confidence motion next week at the request of conservatives
opposed to Ms. Bhutto's left-leaning party.
   Flag-waving government supporters waited outside the assembly
for the announcement. They were watched by dozens of helmeted riot
police.
   There was no unrest, but Speaker Meraj Khalid warned noisy
lawmakers. ``You should avoid a scene which could, God forbid,
present a bad example before the nation,'' he said.
   The Islamic Democratic Alliance, a group of nine mainly
conservative and Islamic fundamentalist parties, called Monday for
the no-confidence motion against the government of Ms. Bhutto's
left-leaning Pakistan People's Party.
   About 105 of 237 assembly members have announced they will vote
against Ms. Bhutto's 10-month-old Cabinet.
   The governing party has 116 seats in the legislature following
the defection of one member on Wednesday. But with the help of
independent lawmakers, it appeared likely to get the necessary 119
votes to stave off a challenge.
   Khalid said debate on the motion will begin Nov. 1.
   Ms. Bhutto predicted the opposition won't be able to muster more
than 90 votes.
   ``The opposition will be totally exposed when the vote takes
place as its members continue to desert its ranks,'' she told
reporters at the assembly building.
   Ms. Bhutto's party won by far the largest bloc of seats in the
National Assembly in November's elections, the first free elections
in more than a decade.
   But her rivals gained control of Punjab province, where 60
percent of Pakistan's 109 million people live.
   Since Ms. Bhutto became prime minister on Dec. 2, 1988, both
sides have vowed to unseat each other.
   Ms. Bhutto's government has been plagued by ethnic violence,
particularly in the country's largest city, Karachi.
   The southern port is in Ms. Bhutto's home province of Sindh,
where hundreds of people have died and thousands more have been
hurt in ethnic turmoil over the past three years.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People who catch the AIDS virus while young have a
far better chance than adults of remaining healthy with the
infection for many years, a study published today shows.
   The research, conducted on people who caught the human
immunodeficiency virus through blood products, is the largest of
several recent studies to show that the older people are, the
faster their infection progresses to AIDS.
   ``The popular notion is that AIDS is inevitable if one is
infected with HIV, and in fact there is no study that shows that,''
said Dr. James J. Goedert. ``The opportunity to provide long-term
health for an HIV-infected child is relatively good, especially
with AZT and other treatments coming along.''
   The drug AZT is often recommended for people infected with HIV
as a way of forestalling the start of AIDS symptoms.
   Goedert's research, conducted at the National Cancer Institute,
was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. It was based
on 319 people who got the AIDS virus through treatment for
hemophilia.
   Because of an inherited defect, hemophiliacs require regular
treatment with a protein called factor VIII that makes their blood
form clots. The factor is made from blood obtained from thousands
of donors. During the early 1980s, the treatment was often
unknowingly contaminated with HIV.
   Manufacturers began heating factor VIII to kill the virus in
1984. But by then, an estimated 60 percent of hemophiliacs in the
United States were already infected.
   As the epidemic progressed, doctors noticed that infected
hemophiliacs seemed to do better than male homosexuals and drug
abusers, the other main risk groups. However, the latest research
suggests this is simply because the hemophiliacs are frequently
younger.
   The study found that 13 percent of those who caught the AIDS
virus before age 18 had gone on to develop AIDS after eight years
of infection. By comparison, AIDS had occured in 27 percent of
those infected between ages 18 and 34 and in 44 percent of people
who got the virus after age 34.
   Goedert said young people might resist the virus longer because
they have more of the blood cells that are primary target of the
virus. Another explanation is that they have never been exposed to
the otherwise harmless microbes that can cause fatal illnesses in
people whose immune defenses are destroyed by HIV.
   ``Possibly there is some unmeasured co-factor associated with
aging,'' he said. ``The cells themselves may respond better in a
young person and control the virus better for a longer period of
time. If that could be demonstrated to be true, that might have
some implications for vaccine research, because a vaccine could be
targeted to enhance that factor.''
   An editorial in the journal by Dr. Harold R. Roberts of the
University of North Carolina said those who treat hemophiliacs can
take little comfort in the latest findings. While the work may
eventually lead to improved therapy, ``it is unlikely that this
will happen within the anticipated life span of currently infected
patients.''
   A separate study in the journal, conducted by German
researchers, found no AIDS infections among 155 hemophiliacs who
were treated with purified factor VIII during the early 1980s.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev met today with the
leading businessmen of this prosperous country to hear ideas for
capitalist projects for the troubled Soviet economy, and he
couldn't believe his ears.
   Gorbachev reviewed Finnish developments in a range of industries
from forestry to clothing for seamen on icebreakers, and he was
clearly astounded when he had a conversation on a mobile telephone.
   ``Is this a joke or is this for real?'' he asked the chairman of
the Nokia electronics company, Simo Vuorilehto, when handed the
receiver. He had a short phone conversation in Russian, but it was
not known with whom.
   The meeting at the Confederation of Finnish Industries came on
the second day of a three-day state visit focusing on how to get
Western know-how and business acumen to bolster Gorbachev's
economic reform.
   Many of the companies represented already have joint projects
with Soviet firms, but Gorbachev told the industrialists there
should be many more. ``We should have dozens and dozens,'' he said.
   One new venture could be forthcoming. The Finnish company OY
Warsila Ab announced today that the Soviet Union and a group of
Finnish and Norwegian companies will launch a feasibility study on
exploiting a natural gas field under the Barents Sea and will set
up a joint venture if it is deemed profitable.
   Gorbachev showed particular interest in the environmental
controls in such industries as mining and metal technology, asking
the cost of such controls.
   Finnish officials have complained that Soviet factories are
responsible for much of their country's air pollution, and the
sides prepared an agreement aimed at curbing transboundary
pollution.
   The chairman of the business confederation, Casimir Ehrenrooth,
told Gorbachev the Finns agreed to a Soviet request to train
industry leaders in Western business management and practices.
   More than 30 other agreements are to be signed for joint
businesses, development projects and political issues.
   Earlier, Gorbachev had a breakfast meeting with Prime Minister
Harri Holkeri to explore state-to-state projects.
   The meetings came as Finnish newspapers lauded Gorbachev's
unequivocal recognition of Finnish neutrality, which in previous
Soviet statements had been couched in qualifications.
   In a dinner speech Wednesday, the Soviet president said, ``I
want to greet a neutral Finland.''
   The issue of neutrality strikes a sensitive chord in Finland,
which often has been derided as being under Moscow's thumb and
adopting subservient policies in exchange for being allowed to
remain independent following military defeats at the hands of the
Soviets.
   ``Gorbachev's dinner speech was marked by new thinking from
beginning to end,'' said an editorial in Helsingi Sanomat.
   On Wednesday, thousands of Finns chanted ``Gorba, Gorba'' and
waited in damp weather as Gorbachev visited a room where Lenin,
founder of the Soviet state, once hid from Czarist forces before
the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. The room is in the house of the
police commissioner of the time in downtown Helsinki.
   The 58-year-old Kremlin chief shook hands and chatted with the
surging crowd. Some held up placards with slogans like,``Welcome
Gorbachev, Welcome New Thinking.''
   But Gorbachev also was dogged by a few protesters, who demanded
negotiations for the return of parts of the eastern Karelia region.
Finland ceded the region after fighting two bitter wars with the
Soviets in 1939 and 1944.
   ``Give us back Karelia,'' some demonstrators shouted from the
back of the crowd. Gorbachev showed no sign he heard.

<HEAD>Fighting Intensifies in Cambodian Provinces</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fighting intensified in four provinces
of Cambodia this month as guerrillas attacked key routes and other
areas held by the pro-Vietnamese government, the Thai army
spokesman said today.
   Lt. Gen. Naruedol Dejpradiyuth said that before peace talks
resume, the two sides ``will try to control more areas and to
attain the upper hand to increase their bargaining power.''
   He reported increased fighting in the western provinces of
Battambang, Banteay Meanchey and Siem Reap and the central province
of Kompong Thom. He said that in frequently fierce combat, the
guerrillas focused attacks on key routes 68 and 69 in the northwest
and on Highway 6, which runs from the northwestern town of Sisophon
to the capital, Phnom Penh.
   Naruedol spoke at a regular news briefing at which Maj. Gen.
Anusorn Krisanasereni, the army's secretary-general, also appeared.
   Anusorn said the guerrillas ``have been able to successfully
launch offensives in many areas while the (pro-Vietnamese forces)
are trying to maintain important strategic positions.''
   He said the guerrillas ``use the method of launching an
offensive, seizing certain areas, and pulling back their forces,
probably because they do not have enough forces to control the
areas.''
   Fighting is expected to intensify in the dry season starting
next month as the pro-Vietnamese army tries to recapture lost
areas, Anusorn said.
   The most important guerrilla victory this month was the Khmer
Rouge seizure of the gem-rich town of Pailin on Sunday. The Khmer
Rouge said that opened the way for an assault on the provincial
capital of Battambang, Cambodian's largest city after the capital,
Phnom Penh.
   The Khmer Rouge army radio said Wednesday the guerrilla group
has set up a military committee to defend Pailin and to allow
guerrilla forces to continue their advance.
   The radio said the guerrillas had ``set up a provisional
military committee to defend and keep Pailin town. This is being
arranged to allow our bigger forces to move ahead freely.''
   It said that once a political settlement to the war is reached,
Pailin and other areas ``liberated'' by the Khmer Rouge will be
placed under the provisional government that will organize an
election.
   The Khmer Rouge killed hundreds of thousands of Cambodians
during the 1970s before it was ousted by Vietnam's invasion in late
1978. It is the largest member of the three-party guerrilla
coalition fighting the government installed by Vietnam.
   The two other groups, the non-communist Khmer People's National
Liberation Front and the army of Prince Norodom Sihanouk, also have
scored significant victories recently.
   Vietnam claimed to have pulled the last of its troops from
Cambodia last month, raising fears the Cambodian government would
not be able to defend itself alone. The guerrillas claim Vietnamese
soldiers remain in the country.
   Talks aimed at reaching a political settlement to the war have
broken down over the government's refusal to give the Khmer Rouge a
role in a future government.

   Researchers said today that the world's oceans
and seas did not show significant warming from 1982 to mid-1988, a
finding that contradicts a recent report.
   The new work, which used data gathered from ships and buoys, is
at odds with an analysis of satellite data published in April.
   A major reason for the difference was that airborne particles
from a Mexican volcano skewed satellite readings during 1982 and
1983, making water temperatures appear cooler than they really
were, researchers said.
   Scientists are interested in ocean temperatures because they may
reflect the greenhouse effect, a predicted global warming due to
buildup of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere.
   The 1982-88 period itself, however, is too brief to draw any
conclusions about the greenhouse effect, researchers said.
   The new study, by Richard Reynolds, research oceanographer at
the federal Climate Analysis Center in Washington, D.C., and two
British scientists appears in today's issue of the British journal
Nature.
   They took issue with a study by A.E. Strong, a research
oceanographer with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration and a visiting scientist at the U.S. Naval Academy
in Annapolis, Md.
   In April, Strong reported that satellite observations show the
world's oceans and seas were warming at the surface by about
one-fifth of a degree Fahrenheit a year between January 1982 and
mid-1988.
   The new work considered some satellite data as well as readings
from ships and buoys. Reynolds, in a telephone interview, said the
volcanic particles were the main problem with the original study.
   He also said calculating a temperature trend over the analyzed
period is difficult because the period is brief, and because it
included two unusual warmings of the eastern equatorial Pacific
Ocean, events called El Ninos.
   Strong, who wrote the April paper, said Wednesday he is working
with the other researchers to study the discrepancies.
   He said that when satellite readings affected by the volcanic
particles were replaced with data from ships and buoys, the
strength of the overall calculated warming trend decreased by about
30 percent.

   Former President Reagan and his wife, Nancy,
thanked the Japanese people today for helping Californians to
recover from last week's devastating earthquake.
   Reagan met briefly with a group of 13 Japanese college students
who volunteered to help Californians clean up and rebuild their
homes in the San Francisco Bay area.
   ``I have just met with one of the most inspiring groups of young
people I have ever encountered,'' Reagan said. ``Their trip to San
Francisco is a most eloquent statement about the special friendship
between the people of Japan and the people of the United States.''
   Both the Reagans and their Japanese hosts, the Fujisankei
Communications Group, have emphasized the positive aspects of ties
between the two nations during the visit, while minimizing thorny
economic differences.
   Mrs. Reagan, meanwhile, was interviewed about her post-White
House life and anti-drug abuse program on the Fuji Television
network, owned by Fujisankei, which reportedly is paying the
Reagans $2 million for the visit.
   ``We're very grateful to the Japanese people for what they've
done, for the assistance they've given'' to the earthquake victims,
Mrs. Reagan said.
   Japanese companies and individuals reportedly have pledged more
than $7 million in earthquake aid, and several groups of Japanese
volunteers have left for California to help in the recovery efforts.
   After meeting with Reagan today, one short-cropped volunteer
smiled and said, ``He pointed at my head and commented that we had
similar haircuts.''
   Reagan's hair has been short since he underwent surgery Sept. 8
to drain fluid from his brain, an injury caused by a horseback
riding accident in July.
   ``Everyone tells him that he looks much younger _ that he looks
about 16 years old,'' Mrs. Reagan said of her husband's hair style.
``But I'm having a little bit of a hard time getting used to it.''

<HEAD>Murder Defendant Has Courtroom Outburst</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The defendant in the rape and murder of a
pregnant doctor in her hospital office swore at a prosecutor who
was questioning a witness about his sanity, then turned another
outburst on the judge.
   ``I'm leaving, man! I'm leaving, (expletive)! You in trouble!''
Steven Smith screamed as prosecutor James Kindler cross-examined a
defense psychiatrist who testified the suspect was too deranged to
be prosecuted.
   Several jurors stared in surprise at Smith, who was standing at
the defense table. The defendant then said softly, ``There's
nothing I can do about it, man.''
   The turmoil Wednesday was sparked when Kindler asked Dr. Daniel
Schwartz if Smith could be faking insanity to receive lenient
treatment.
   State Supreme Court Justice James Leff, the trial judge, then
cleared the jury from the room and told Smith he would tolerate no
further outbursts, which prompted another explosion from the
defendant.
   ``You want me to stop it? I can't control it! Listen to me, man,
I'm not normal, man, at all, at all,'' said Smith. ``That's what
got me into trouble here now. ... I'm here to get help, brother.''
   Smith was then cuffed and led from the courtroom. Leff brought
the jury back and cross-examination of Schwartz continued.
   Smith, 23, is on trial for the rape and killing Jan. 9 of Dr.
Kathryn Hinnant, 33, at Bellevue Hospital. She was five months
pregnant.
   Schwartz, chief of forensic psychiatry at Brooklyn's Kings
County Hospital, said Smith appears to have a psychosis related to
schizophrenia.
   Schwartz said Smith has complained of hearing voices,
hallucinating and being unable to control his actions since he was
14. Smith, he said, apparently tried to commit suicide three times.
   He has been in and out of mental hospitals for the past decade.
   Contributing to Smith's insanity, Schwartz testified, is his
belief that his mother tried to abort him and wanted him dead.
   Smith's mother, Marian, who is in court every day, denied her
son's comments to psychiatrists. ``As far as not getting love and
care from me _ that's a lie,'' she said outside the courtroom. ``As
far as wanting him dead _ that's a lie.''
   Smith has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to the murder
charge. If convicted, he could be sentenced to 25 years to life.
   The jury is expected to begin deliberations Monday.

   Israeli security forces shot and killed an
18-year-old Palestinian today after he ran his car into a policeman
at a West Bank roadblock, the army said. Troops killed a second
Palestinian in the Gaza Strip.
   The man fatally shot by soldiers in Gaza's Jabaliya refugee camp
was wearing a mask and ignored orders to halt and warning shots in
the air, the army said. He was identified as Adel Abu Salem, 19.
   Arab reporters said the soldiers surprised masked youths
painting anti-Israeli slogans by arriving in a civilian Mercedes
car and out of uniform. The army announcement made no mention of
the soldiers being in civilian dress.
   At least four people also were wounded in Jabaliya when police
fired plastic bullets and rubber-coated steel balls to quell a
stone-throwing protest that erupted after the masked man's
shooting, Arab hospital officials said.
   In separate clashes with soldiers, a 12-year-old Palestinian boy
was shot in the thigh in the Gaza Strip village of Beit Hanoun and
a 26-year-old man was wounded in the West Bank's Faraa refugee
camp, hospital officials said.
   In the West Bank, security forces chased a car driven by a
Palestinian through the streets of Bethlehem after the driver
intentionally ran into a policeman at a roadblock, an army
announcement said.
   Security forces shot and killed the driver when he failed to
halt, the announcment said. It said the policeman was hospitalized
with minor injuries.
   The Palestinian, identified as Naeem Karim Daamseh, 18, died at
a hospital in nearby Beit Jala. Hospital officials said he was shot
in the neck.
   The deaths raised to 605 the number of Palestinians killed by
Israeli soldiers and civilians in the 22-month uprising against
Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Forty Israelis also have been slain in the violence, and 135
Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs as alleged
collaborators with Israeli authorities
   Also in the Gaza Strip, the army destroyed two houses whose
residents were accused of attacking suspected collaborators, the
army said. Nineteen people lived in the homes in the villages of
Abassan and Beni Suhaillah, Arab reporters said.
   Army figures show soldiers have torn down more than 220
Palestinian houses during the uprising. Human rights groups say the
figure is higher.

<HEAD>Doctor's Device to End Terminal Illnesses Sparks Controversy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROYAL OAK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pathologist says a device he invented
that allows terminally ill patients to kill themselves is humane
and painless, but some authorities say making it available could
result in criminal charges.
   The apparatus developed by Dr. Jack Kevorkian injects a lethal
drug. He says death would occur in three to four minutes.
   The device can be hooked up by a doctor but is then controlled
by the patient. When the patient presses a button, a harmless
intravenous injection of saline solution is shut off and the drug
thiopental is injected. The drug induces a coma and potassium
chloride is injected automatically to stop the patient's heart, the
Royal Oak private researcher said.
   Oakland County Assistant Prosecutor Gerald Poisson said someone
providing such a device could be charged with murder, but the chief
of the Wayne County prosecutor's appellate division, Jim Baughman,
disagreed.
   ``If you actually take part in the act, that's criminal,''
Baughman said. ``If you provide the means to do it, that's not.''
   Doctors said the device presents an ethical dilemma.
   ``We do not actively intervene to end life,'' said Dr. Myron
LaBan, president of the Oakland County Medical Society. ``He's
providing this instrument. It's no different whether you give the
patient a gun or a knife.''
   Kevorkian said he doesn't fear criminal or ethical violations.
   ``It's dignified, humane and painless, and the patient can do it
in the comfort of their own home at any time they want,'' he said.
``I'm here to help anybody who's in distress, or thinks he is. I
couldn't let dogs suffer like that, how can I let a human?''
   The American Medical Association opposes the instrument. The
organization will accept cutting a patient's life-support system in
some cases, but has said it doesn't believe a doctor should provide
the means of death.

<HEAD>Palestinian Pasta Entangles Manufacturer in Legal Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLYN FISHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of Israeli merchants have asked police
to probe whether an Arab noodle maker is wrapping its pasta in the
Palestinian flag.
   A spokesman for the Israeli Manufacturers' Association said
today that the group has filed a police complaint against the firm
for using the four colors of the outlawed Palestinian flag on its
spaghetti packages.
   ``We asked police to investigate why they are allowed to
distribute the flag in this way. It should be considered against
the law,'' said Danny Leish, a spokesman for the Israeli industrial
group.
   The police complaint is the latest battle in a war of symbols
that is part the Palestinian uprising against Israeli control of
the occupied territories. The complaint also reflects the anger of
Jewish industrialists with an economic slump partly caused by the
22-month rebellion.
   The Palestinian flag, which Israel considers a ``PLO flag,'' is
outlawed by Israel, as is the PLO, which the Jewish state considers
a terrorist organization.
   The spaghetti in question is produced by the Al Ghazel Macaroni
Co. in the West Bank city of Bethlehem. It is marketed in a package
decorated with green, black, red and white stripes.
   The company's owner, Wadi Abu Eta, could not be reached for
comment because phone lines were cut to the Bethlehem area.
   Ruth Shlesinger, a spokeswoman for national police in Jerusalem,
declined to comment on the complaint, which was filed two weeks ago.
   Leish denied the complaint was aimed at harming an Arab
competitor, but acknowledged Israeli food manufacturers were among
the hardest hit in the recession touched off by the rebellion in
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Unemployment currently
exceeds 9.5 percent in Israel.
   Food manufacturers have lost about $100 million during the
22-month-old uprising and had to cut about 1,000 jobs, Leish said.
He blamed much of the damage on an uprising boycott of Israeli
products by the occupied territories' 1.7 million Arabs.
   Leish complained that the problem is compounded by Arab
competitors marketing their products within Israel, adding the
Manufacturers' Association already has asked the army to insist
Palestinian products be clearly identified as such.
   The spaghetti dispute is the latest of a string of Israeli steps
against symbols of Palestinian nationhood. Forcing Arab youths to
pull down Palestinian flags is a regular occurrence in the disputed
lands.
   Sometimes names also are considered symbols. The Hadashot daily
reported that an Israeli hospital refused this week to register a
Bedouin Arab baby girl given the popular uprising name ``Tahrir,''
Arabic for ``liberation.''
   Speaking of symbols, Israeli reports noted the Al Ghazal
spaghetti package also bears a Kosher stamp, showing it meets with
Jewish dietary laws.

<HEAD>Cheney Warns of Increasing Hi-Tech Exports to East Bloc</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JESSICA BALDWIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MILDENHALL, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said
today that despite changes in the East bloc, the West must remain
``very cautious'' about selling it high-technology equipment.
   Answering questions during a visit to a U.S. air base in eastern
England, Cheney said it was necessary to maintain the COCOM regime
_ the organization of industrial democracies that regulates trade
in items to Soviet bloc nations. COCOM stands for Coordinating
Committee for Multilateral Export Controls.
   Cheney arrived here Wednesday from a NATO meeting in Portugal
and had talks with British Defense Secretary Tom King. His next
stop was West Germany.
   The export committee's 17 member states _ the United States, 14
of its NATO allies, Australia and Japan _ are meeting at a secret
venue in Paris.
   Cheney welcomed the changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe but said the West needs to remain ``very cautious about the
kinds of technology we allow to be transferred to the eastern
bloc.''
   He said the Soviet Union still has ``a huge arsenal of
intercontinental ballistic weapons and other strategic systems''
targeted against the United States and other NATO members.
   ``They are the only nation in the world capable of destroying
us. I think it is in our interests, under those circumstances, to
continue the COCOM regime,'' Cheney said.
   The United States' COCOM allies are pressing for an easing of
trade restrictions, leaving Washington all but isolated, according
to a U.S. source who spoke on condition of anonymity before the
meeting began Wednesday.
   European members accuse the United States of failing to adapt to
the changes in the East bloc and of using COCOM to protect U.S.
manufacturers from foreign competition.
   At the NATO meeting in Portugal, Cheney expressed concern about
a Kremlin push to upgrade its strategic, or long-range, nuclear
weapons.
   ``The Soviet Union still possesses enormous military
capability,'' he said. ``The Soviets continue with an aggressive
modernization program of their own strategic (nuclear) systems.''
   He said their ``strategic capability is more robust today than
it was when Mr. Gorbachev came to power.''
   In their final statement, Cheney and the other NATO officials
called on the Soviet Union to make unilateral cuts in its
short-range nuclear missile systems to current NATO levels.
   According to Western estimates, the Soviet Union has 1,450
short-range nuclear missile launchers in Europe. NATO has 88 Lance
launchers, most based in West Germany.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has promised to pull out
500 short-range nuclear weapons from Europe this year.

   A high-ranking Communist Party official met today
with leaders of East Germany's largest pro-democracy group and
discussed reform efforts, the latest government gesture to the
growing protest movement.
   It was the first time a member of the ruling Communist Party
Politburo had met with opponents of the East German political
system. The activists later called the talks an encouraging step
toward reform.
   Earlier today, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl called new
East German leader Egon Krenz to talk about ways to improve
relations.
   East Berlin Communist Party chief and Politburo member Guenter
Schabowski met for two hours with Jens Reich, an East Berlin
biology professor and founding member of the pro-reform group New
Forum. Another New Forum founder, Sebastian Pflugbeil, also
attended the meeting.
   ``We presented New Forum's concepts and ideas,'' Reich told
reporters after the meeting at the party Central Committee
building. The talks were ``open and constructive.''
   Asked why they were invited to meet with Schabowski, Reich said:
``He told us he wanted to begin a new political course and wanted
to learn about the whole political spectrum here.''
   Reich said Schabowski assured him the government's newfound
interest in dialogue to solve the nation's problems ``was a real
change and not a tactical move.'' Schabowski also said the
government would consider changes in election procedures.
   The government in the past has refused to deal with opposition
activists, ignoring or persecuting them. Activists have campaigned
for a more democratic electoral system and the right to travel to
the West.
   Asked if he believed a genuine dialogue could develop between
pro-democracy groups and the government, Reich said: ``We will see.
I can say cautiously that I have a positive impression.''
   Schabowski told West Germany television on Wednesday, ``We are
ready for a dialogue with all levels of society.''
   Communist authorities banned New Forum in September, but it has
been tolerated since then. Schabowski was asked about official
recognition of the opposition group, but he said it was ``out of
his capacity,'' Reich said.
   Krenz on Wednesday hinted that opposition groups could be
included in talks about possible reform, but reiterated that the
nation's communist system is not a matter for debate.
   Hans Klein, Kohl's spokesman, said Kohl and Krenz talked for 20
minutes ``in a businesslike and constructive atmosphere.'' It was
the first contact between the leaders since Krenz replaced Erich
Honecker last week as the government struggled with ways to quell
growing public unrest.
   Krenz, although considered an orthodox socialist like Honecker,
has been trying to keep an unruly citizenry in check by offering to
open dialogue with groups advocating economic and social reform.
   Krenz made clear that East Germany will remain a socialist
state, though reforms will be considered, and reiterated a call on
Bonn to recognize East German citizenship, the East German
state-run news agency ADN reported.
   West Germany gives immediate citizenship to any immigrant of
German origin, which has played a role in the flight of more than
60,000 East Germans to the West over the past few months.
   East Berlin Mayor Erhard Krack called today for a town hall
debate on reform, another sign of the government's recent
willingness to consider public views. The Communist Party's
Berliner Zeitung newspaper said the meeting would be held Sunday
under the motto, ``Open doors, open words.''
   Pro-democracy protests continued Wednesday in various parts of
the country. Thousands marched in the cities of Neubrandenburg and
Jena and about 2,000 people joined in a church vigil on East
Berlin's Alexanderplatz, ADN reported.
   ADN said 20,000 people joined in what it called a ``march of
hope'' in Neubrandenburg, north of Berlin.
   The marchers called for a dialogue with authorities and the
city's mayor, Heinz Hahn, promised talks with citizens, ADN said.
   In Jena, 5,000 people marched peacefully to the city hall and
delivered a petition to Mayor Hans Spahn, ADN said. No details of
the petition were given, but ADN said Spahn urged the crowd to
refrain from further demonstrations and promised that the city hall
was ``open to every citizen.''
   Opposition activists are demanding free elections and speech and
many say they do not object to socialism as long as it is truly
democratic.
   Krenz has promised new laws shortly that would give East Germans
greater freedom to travel, but made clear the Berlin Wall will not
come down.
   Strict curbs on foreign travel have been a prime source of
complaint by East Germans. Tens of thousands of young, skilled
workers disillusioned with their homeland have fled to West Germany
in recent months.

<HEAD>AZT Will Soon be Available to More Children With AIDS</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: Inserts graf 8, In the past, with Sullivan quote to conference.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government will allow wider
distribution to children of AZT, the only government-approved
anti-AIDS drug, Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan
announced today.
   The action marks the first time any AIDS drug has been approved,
even conditionally, for use in children under 13.
   The drug will be available under what the Food and Drug
Administration calls a ``Treatment IND,'' which allows widespread
distribution of a drug that appears to be promising on the basis of
clinical trials.
   ``Today's action is a significant advance in extending AIDS
therapy to children. It will give many sick children availability
to a drug that offers promise for improving or even extending their
lives,'' Sullivan said in a statement announcing the program.
   ``We still need more data to be absolutely sure about the full
range of effects from AZT,'' Sullivan said on ABC-TV's ``Good
Morning America'' program. ``But we have enough preliminary
evidence that the drug is effective and seems to be safe under the
conditions of usage.
   Sullivan said studies on AZT in children will continue.
   ``This is indeed an interim process before the drug is finally
approved for use in children,'' the secretary said.
   ``In the past, many physicians have been reluctant to use AZT
for children because it is not labeled for this use, and because of
concerns that the drug's side effects might be even more severe in
children,'' Sullivan said in a speech to an AIDS conference. ``But
clinical data now indicates that children receiving AZT experience
the same degree of side effects that occur in adults.''
   Children ages 3 months to 12 years who have symptoms of advanced
infection with the AIDS virus will be eligible to receive it free
under the program sponsored by the maker of AZT, Burroughs Wellcome
Co., based in Research Triangle Park, N.C.
   According to the latest count by the national Centers for
Disease Control in Atlanta, 1,859 children under 13 have AIDS. They
constitute about 2 percent of all AIDS cases.
   Mathilde Krim of the American Foundation for AIDS Research said
the announcement was ``a good step'' but was overdue.
   Sullivan defended against such criticism, saying, ``We really
have a very careful balancing act that we have to undertake. First
of all, we want to be sure that the drugs we approve are effective
for what they are intended to do. But at the same time, we need to
be sure that they do not have adverse side effects that might
override the beneficial effects of the drug.''
   Krim also said she is worried about future access to the drug.
   ``What worries me is, once this is marketed how available will
it be to children'' when it is no longer distributed free, she said.
   She said 75 percent of children with AIDS are from poor and
modest-income families, often minorities, where the mother and
father also have AIDS but may not qualify for Medicaid. ``They
won't have the means to buy the treatment for themselves or their
kids,'' she said. A year's course of AZT now costs between $2,700
and $6,500, depending on the dose.
   AZT is now available in the form of a new strawberry-flavored
syrup that is easier for children to swallow than capsules are. It
also allows dosages to be adjusted for body size.
   Zidovudine, commonly called AZT and which attacks the AIDS
virus, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for
teen-agers and adults with advanced symptoms of AIDS in March 1987.
   Recently completed studies have shown the drug extends the lives
of adults with AIDS and delays the development of symptoms in those
who are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, but
are not yet sick.
   Though the drug is not labeled for use in children, physicians
still could prescribe it for this age group. However, many have
been reluctant because of fears that the side effects of the highly
toxic drug may be more severe in children than in adults, the
sources said.
   But research studies that involved more than 200 children have
indicated that AZT may prolong their survival without raising the
risk of side effects.
   ``It seems the drug is as effective in kids as in adults and the
toxicity risks are about the same,'' one source said.
   In September, researchers reported that the most extensive study
of AZT in children, part of a National Institutes of Health
project, showed the drug is safe, helps children gain weight and
avoid life-threatening infections, and improves their well-being.
   Studies will continue to evaluate the effects on children of AZT
in combination with other drugs and the benefits of the drug when
used in children in earlier stages of the disease.
   Physicians who want to enroll child patients in the AZT program
can call Burroughs Wellcome's toll-free number, 1-800-829-7337 from
8 a.m. to 7 p.m. EDT.

<HEAD>Nuclear Plant Fire Sparks Worries, Controversy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VANDELLOS, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fire at a nuclear power plant here has
renewed nearby residents' worries about evacuation plans and has
energized opponents facing the ruling Socialist Party in a general
election on Sunday.
   The Oct. 19 fire damaged one of the two turbine generators
powering the plant's cooling systtem, but never affected its
graphite core, said Fausto Sanchez Cascado, spokesman at the
17-year-old Vandellos I nuclear plant.
   ``Everything happened in the exterior (electrical) part of the
plant. It never affected the reactor,'' Sanchez Cascado said in a
telephone interview today.
   There was no radiation released and the fire caused no injuries,
Sanchez Cascado said. The fire did reduce the plant's cooling
capacity by half, but it still had double that needed to cool the
nuclear core.
   Authorities have shut down the Spanish-built plant indefinitely
and Spain's Nuclear Safety Commission is investigating the
accident. Industry Minister Claudio Aranzadi said it was too early
to decide whether to close the plant permanently.
   The accident sparked major media coverage, some of it erroneous,
and calls for a nuclear power moratorium by campaigning opposition
leaders a week before general elections.
   ``All of the political parties are trying to take advantage,''
Industry and Energy Minister Undersecretary Victor Perez Pita said.
   Recent newspapers polls indicate voters are expected to give the
Socialists their third-straight parliamentary majority.
   ``The incident could have been serious,'' said Carlos Barcelo,
mayor of Vandellos, a small town about six miles from the plant.
``But it has been capitalized on by politicians and the public has
not received good information.''
   Spain's leading daily El Pais, which published five front-page
articles on the fire in six days, erroneously reported Wednesday
that the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency had
described the accident as the worst since the April 1986 Chernobyl
disaster in the Soviet Union.
   In today's edition, El Pais said the judgment it attributed to
the agency had come from the agency's press clipping service in
which El Pais and other Spanish dailies had been mentioned.
   ``El Pais cited itself attributing its own views to the (atomic
energy agency),'' according to an agency statement issued today by
spokesman Hans Friedrich Meyer.
   Meanwhile, Barcelo and three other area mayors threatened to
pull out of the government's nuclear emergency evacuation plan,
after claiming that civil defense officials failed to notify them
about the fire for 30 minutes.
   The fire highlighted inadequate civil defense measures, Barcelo
said. The town's city administration has decided to take the
National Civil Defense Agency to court if it fails to better equip
local officials for an emergency.
   Vandellos I is Spain's third-oldest nuclear power plant. It was
built using French technology, went into service in 1972 and is to
remain operating until 2003.
   A consortium formed by the French utility Electricite de France
and several Spanish electric companies own the plant, a cold-gas
reactor that uses natural uranium as opposed to the enriched
uranium used by pressurized water reactors.
   These types of plants are set to be phased out of operation in
France in the next five years.

   Jim Bakker seems to be adapting to a
lifestyle much different from the one he lived as the leader of a
multimillion-dollar religious empire.
   Instead of silk, the PTL founder wears an orange jumpsuit, and
he changed more luxurious quarters for a cell shared with another
inmate.
   Still, ``he was in good spirits this morning when I met with
him,'' said Brian Ross, a spokesman at the medium-security
Talladega Federal Correctional Institution where Bakker on
Wednesday served the first full day of his 45-year sentence.
   The minister's mother said her son was wrongly imprisoned.
   ``They treated Jim like he was a dog,'' said Bakker's mother,
Furnia, in a telephone interview today from her home on the grounds
of Heritage USA at Fort Mill, S.C. ``We've been through a lot, but
this is the worst.''
   She said she cannot stop thinking of her son. ``I can't believe
my son is in prison,'' Mrs. Bakker said.
   ``My husband (Raleigh Bakker) just went to the doctor,'' she
said. ``This is awfully hard on both of us. We're both 83 and this
is hard to take.''
   Bakker arrived at the facility Tuesday night in handcuffs and
shackles after a six-hour drive from Charlotte, N.C., where a
federal judge banished him immediately to prison after imposing the
sentence and a $500,000 fine.
   Bakker was convicted Oct. 5 of defrauding thousands of followers
of his television ministry.
   ``He's settling in,'' Ross said. ``He's adjusting and becoming
familiar with his surroundings. He's doing fine.''
   Two former Bakker aides are being held at another federal prison
in Alabama. Brothers James and David Taggart reported Wednesday to
a Montgomery lockup to begin serving more than 17 years for tax
evasion.
   Bakker was assigned to a two-man cell. Prison officials would
not reveal his cellmate's identity.
   Ross said Bakker made some telephone calls Wednesday morning and
exercised. He would not disclose if Bakker had spoken with his
wife, Tammy Faye Bakker, or other family members.
   The Bakkers' new television ministry in Orlando, Fla., has been
suspended, but the storefront church they had been running in a
shopping mall remains open. Mrs. Bakker and guest ministers were
expected to conduct Sunday services.
   Mrs. Bakker, who did not attend Tuesday's sentencing, was
staying with friends in the Orlando area and did not make herself
available to reporters.
   Ross said he met with Bakker Wednesday morning to relay numerous
media requests for interviews, which Bakker referred to his
attorney in North Carolina.
   Bakker's lawyer, Harold Bender, said prejudicial pretrial
publicity will be the key issue on appeal, which he filed Tuesday.
   Moreover, he said, Bakker's sentence is excessive. ``We believe
because of his celebrity status that the sentence was in the range
that it was,'' he told CBS News Wednesday.
   Ross said no additional security measures were planned during
Bakker's stay at the prison, which often is the first stop for
prisoners in the Southeast. He is expected to stay there no more
than two weeks before he is transferred to another federal prison,
which officials declined to reveal.
   Ross said Bakker's family and attorneys can visit the defrocked
TV evangelist for three evenings during the week and all day on
weekends. Bakker also will be able to attend religious services on
Sunday.

   ``Zerograd,'' a satire about life after glasnost
in the Soviet Union by Soviet director Karen Chakhnazarov, has won
the Gold Hugo, the top award in the Chicago International Film
Festival.
   ``Birth,'' a study of a father's search for his missing son
directed by India's Shaji Karun, and ``Death of a Teamaster,'' a
drama set in 17th century Japan directed by Kei Kumai, both earned
Silver Hugos.
   The awards were voted by a nine-member jury of film

   Hong Kong director Alex Law's ``Painted Faces'' won a Silver
Hugo for best first feature.
   Silver Hugos for acting were awarded to Grazyna Szapolowska for
her role in Krzysztof Kieslowski's Polish feature, ``A Short Film
About Love,'' and to Jorg Gudzuhn for his performance in the East
German ``Fallada _ The Last Chapter.''
   Gold Plaques for acting were awarded to Caterina Sylos Labini
for the Italian comedy ``The Icicle Thief,'' and to Richard
Anconina for the French film ``Itinerary of a Spoiled Child.''
   The jury awarded special citations to Ivan Nichev's ``Ivan and
Alexandra'' from Bulgaria, Hungarian director Ferenc Teglasy's
``Never, Nowhere, to No One,'' and Idrissa Ouedraogo's ``Yaaba''
from Burkina Faso in West Africa.
   The festival continues through Nov. 2.

   President Bush today signed a record $3.45
billion disaster relief package intended primarily for
earthquake-stricken Northern California, saying the aid signals
that ``all of us care very much about this.''
   Bush, flanked by members of the California congressional
delegation in the Oval Office, said the package that was rushed
through the House and Senate this week will provide $2.8 billion in
aid to quake victims.
   Asked by reporters whether the aid would be enough in the face
of mounting damage estimates, the president replied: ``I've pledged
to do what we need to do ... and we got this done.''
   ``We are hopeful that this action, taken in great speed and
compassion by the Congress, will send a signal that all of us,
crossing party lines, care very much about this,'' he said.
   Bush also said that the government action ``cannot exceed the
action of private citizens who are pitching in to help neighbors
and friends out there.''
   The legislation also contains assistance for victims of
Hurricane Hugo and other natural disasters.
   Besides providing earthquake recovery aid, the measure averted a
federal government shutdown today and keeps the government
operating through Nov. 15 while Congress and the White House
complete some late spending bills.
   ``This bill is an unprecedented federal response to a disaster
of unprecedented dimension,'' Rep. Glenn Anderson, D-Calif., said
Wednesday.
   But the Californians predicted they'd be back for more.
   ``We have done a little better than a down payment,'' said Rep.
Vic Fazio, D-Calif. He predicted a request for more aid in the
spring, but said the current bill would help provide ``some
sustenance, some security, and some comfort in their hour of need.''
   The bill was given final congressional approval Wednesday night
when the House accepted, by a 303-107 vote, a Senate amendment that
added to a $2.85 billion relief plan the House passed Tuesday.
   The Senate beefed up the package, which it passed 97-1, by
waiving federal rules that would have slowed the flow of money to
the state and blocked federal aid in some cases, including repair
of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge.
   In addition to the $2.85 billion in federal spending passed by
the House, the Senate voted to allow earthquake victims, as well as
those rebuilding from Hurricane Hugo, to take more out of a Small
Business Administration disaster fund. That could bring an extra
$600 million more to California, sponsors said.
   The legislation dwarfed the previous largest disaster bill, a
$1.1 billion package passed only a few weeks ago in response to
Hugo.
   Many expect the San Francisco-area quake to rank as the
costliest natural disaster in U.S. history, with estimates running
above $7 billion.
   The emergency legislation includes $1.1 billion for the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, $1 billion for highway repair and a
$250 million fund for the president to spend on earthquake efforts
at his discretion.
   The legislation adds $500 million to the existing SBA disaster
fund and includes a provision designed to let the agency make
available up to $1.8 billion from that fund this year, with an
estimated $1.1 billion of that going to California earthquake
victims seeking to rebuild their homes or businesses.
   California lawmakers said they would try to persuade Bush to
lift a $100,000 cap on what the SBA can loan to any individual
homeowner.
   The state won approval of provisions that would waive several
rules designed to control federal highway spending in any single
emergency.
   Those include a $100 million aid limit per state on highway
funds, and extending from 90 days to 180 days the time period
during which California can receive 100 percent federal
reimbursement for emergency road repairs.
   The Bay bridge normally would not be repaired at federal expense
because it is a toll road.
   Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn., complained that while the area was
surely in need, the Congress was embarking on ``excessive and
largely unknown disbursements.''
   Lawmakers of both parties expressed concern that relief agencies
carry out the job with speed and efficiency.
   A House Democratic organization released a report pointing out
that all eight top management positions at FEMA remain unfilled by
Bush, with a nomination pending for only one of those slots.
   ``The Bush administration's attempt to manage without managers
is likely to prove costly before all the bills are paid,'' said the
report by the Democratic Study Group, which recited complaints
about FEMA's slow response to Hugo.

   A freighter carrying thousands of gallons of diesel
fuel ran aground on a coral reef in the Key Largo National Marine
Sanctuary and ripped its hull, but no leaks were reported, the
Coast Guard said today.
   The 155-foot freighter Alec Owen Maitland, hauling no cargo but
carrying 8,000 to 10,000 gallons of diesel fuel for its own
engines, ran aground Wednesday afternoon about five miles off Key
Largo, Coast Guard Petty Officer Keith Richter said.
   The hull was gashed and the ship took on water in its forward
ballast tank.
   ``The forward tank has about 5 feet of water in it, but she's
not spilling any oil,'' Richter said.
   Two commercial tugs weren't strong enough to move the ship at
high tide this morning and a stronger tug was sent from Miami,
sanctuary Officer Harry Jackson said. Conditions were ideal with
1-foot seas, light wind and a sunny sky.
   There are no designated shipping lanes along the reef around the
Florida Keys, Jackson said. The Coast Guard said the freighter
draws 12 to 14 feet, and charts for the area show depths as shallow
at 2 to 4 feet.
   The ship, owned by Maitland Bros. Co. of Littlestown, Pa., ran
aground while traveling from Miami to Mobile, Ala., the Coast Guard
said.
   The ship's mate on duty when the ship ran aground was given a
breath test for alcohol, but the results were not yet available,
said Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Paul Von Protz. No one was injured among
the crew of five.

   The Bush administation today signaled the
Soviet Union that it is willing to discuss an offer by Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze to curtail its military bases in
Europe.
   ``We support that aim and are willing to work with them to
preserve their security through political rather than military
means,'' the State Department said.
   A statement issued by the press office said similar Soviet
proposals in the past appeared to be aimed at the elimination of
U.S. bases on foreign soil. ``We cannot accept such an outcome,''
the statement said. ``We maintain bases as part of a successful
system of collective defense which has assured our security and
that of our friends and allies.''
   However, the State Department said, the proposal Tuesday by
Shevardnadze in a Moscow speech could mean the Soviets now are
searching for ways to disengage from some of their foreign military
commitments, particularly in Europe.
   Initially, the White House brushed off Shevardnadze's proposal,
which vied for attention with his acknowledgement that the Soviet
invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 was a mistake and that the radar
installation at Krasnoyarsk violated the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty with the United States.
   But the statement from the State Department, which apparently
was cleared by high-ranking officials, signaled a U.S. willingness
to talk to the Soviets about the proposal.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III is expected to go to the
Soviet Union this winter for a meeting with Shevardnadze that
probably will concentrate on preparations for a superpower summit
between Presidents Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said in Europe that ``we're always
looking at base structure, especially in a time of tight budgets.''
And he noted that U.S. operations at Torrejon in Spain were based
phased out. At the request of the Spanish government the F-15 jet
fighters stationed there are being moved to Italy.
   Meanwhile, U.S. intelligence sources disclosed the Soviets were
deploying two new kinds of advanced nuclear-tipped missiles around
Moscow as part of a vastly upgraded defense of the capital.
   A sophisticated new radar system also is being deployed, the
sources said Wednesday night.
   When completed, the three-part upgrading program, legal under
the 1972 treaty with the United States, would defend Moscow with
100 new launchers, most of them underground.
   The complex network would also protect the Soviet high command,
sources told The Associated Press. The Soviets already have a
labyrinthian system designed to speed Soviet leaders to safety in
the event of a nuclear war.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
Soviets had been working on an improved missile defense since 1980,
but only last spring were found to have begun making the system
operational.
   New long-range missile interceptors, designed to take the place
of an earlier, less sophisticated version of the weapon known in
western military circles as ``Galosh,'' have the mission of
stopping incoming ballistic missiles above the atmosphere.
   A shorter-range, extremely fast missile known as ``Gazelle'' is
being deployed as a complementary defensive missile designed to
catch missile warheads in the atmosphere that might have gotten by
the ``Galosh.''
   Gazelle is supposed to be able to discriminate between decoys
and the real thing.
   The new radar at Pushkino, about 25 miles northeast of Moscow,
was described as ``considerably advanced'' and able to track
targets anywhere in its 360-degree field of vision.
   First word of the new Soviet deployments came in a report on the
Cable News Network.
   The 1972 treaty limits U.S. and Soviet defenses on the basis of
the then-dominant theory that a potential attacker might be
deterred from striking if massive retaliation was the likely
response. A defense against retaliation might lead the possessor of
such a defense to the conclusion that he could strike in safety,
according to that theory.
   However, the treaty was amended to permit the two countries to
protect their capitals and one other target, and then was amended
again to permit the defense of one place in each country.
   The Soviets chose to shield Moscow while the United States
installed a ``Safeguard'' system to protect Minuteman missiles near
Grand Forks, N.D. The North Dakota system was dismantled shortly
after it was finished in 1975 and none has been built since.

   Rebuilding went ahead from mountain
landslide areas to the earthquake-scrambled Port of Oakland, but
there were new signs of a return to normal as even traffic officers
resumed issuing tickets after a week's unplanned moratorium.
   Tolls on bridges went back into effect today. Children returned
to school in the hard-hit Marina district.
   Congress on Wednesday approved a $3.45 billion package of
federal aid to areas ravaged by the Oct. 17 quake, and President
Bush signed it today.
   Asked if it would be enough, Bush said, ``I've pledged to do
what we need to do ... and we got this done.''
   ``We are hopeful that this action, taken in great speed and
compassion by the Congress, will send a signal that all of us,
crossing party lines, care very much about this,'' he said.
   In the agricultural community of Watsonville, south of San
Francisco, officials fearing health and safety dangers from
unrefrigerated food and open cooking fires urged residents of tent
cities to move to shelters.
   ``Our plan is not to physically move people but to convince them
that their options are better at other places,'' Fire Chief Gary
Smith said at a news conference Wednesday in a park where about 160
people have set up camp.
   Some of those camping in parks and lots were driven from their
homes because of damage, while others said they would feel unsafe
returning to their homes even though inspectors have certified them
sound.
   Others wished they could return home. Landslides in the Santa
Cruz Mountains have claimed 100 houses and severely damaged three
times that many, officials said Wednesday.
   In Lompico Canyon on Wednesday, Kieran Reid worked to shore up
his landslide-damaged house. Though it sustained cracks and lost
its chimney, he said he felt lucky.
   Not far away, one house could be seen literally cracked in half,
its furniture spilled on the ground. Others had plastic covering
gaps in the roof.
   ``It's like a tornado. Some people have lost everything and
others haven't,'' said Wilson Scaling, head of the federal Soil
Conservation Service after a helicopter tour of the landslide area.
   ``If we have a wet winter, there's a potential for a lot of
slides,'' he said. ``I feel very sorry for these folks. They're
kind of sitting on a powder keg. The potential is there for
something else, but hopefully that won't occur.''
   Scaling said his agency is turning over $400,000 for emergency
work, including surveys to assess damage to streams, channels and
dams in a 10-county area.
   Gov. George Deukmejian praised Congress' quick action on the
relief bill. ``Not only did they approve the emergency funding, but
they also passed several significant changes in the law that ...
will assist the massive cleanup effort,'' he said.
   A survey in the San Francisco Chronicle on Wednesday did not
give federal officials such high marks. Thirty-six percent of Bay
area residents polled found the federal response the the quake fair
or poor.
   Forty-nine percent found it excellent or good, compared with 72
percent who felt that way about the local government response and a
59 percent positive rating for the state.
   Damage estimates have been set at $7.1 billion.
   Police said six people remained unaccounted for, and the death
toll remained at 63, including 39 from the collapse of
double-decked Interstate 880 in Oakland. Nearly 14,000 people were
reported homeless.
   ``I'm taking it one day at a time right now,'' said Lynn
Carrere, who was being sheltered by the Red Cross at the Marina
Middle School after her apartment was heavily damaged. ``The
aftershocks are really getting on my nerves.''
   Some students were upset to find 175 displaced people still in
their school when it reopened.
   ``It's sort of weird,'' said one girl. ``We can't get to the
gym. The yard is split in half for the Red Cross.'' A boy said some
students felt they had sacrified enough.
   Administrators said they were happy to help.
   ``These are people who need the help,'' said Assistant Principal
Norm Sui. ``Things are going fine.''
   In Oakland, crews continued to dismantle a section of I-880. The
search for more bodies was delayed because the road was too shaky.
Demolition along the entire 1\-mile crippled stretch won't be
complete until December, officials said.
   Buck Helm, the I-880 survivor, remained in serious but stable
condition. ``He's doing well,'' said Phyllis Brown, a spokeswoman
for Highland General Hospital in Oakland.
   Also improving were 6-year-old Julio Berumen and his sister,
Cathy, 8, who lost their mother in the I-880 collapse. Some 500
letters to the children and more than $25,000 in checks have
flooded a fund set up for them.
   Meanwhile, cleanup and rebuilding continued throughout the Bay
area.
   At the Port of Oakland, where an estimated $75 million in damage
included two derailed container cranes, nine of 10 marine terminals
were back in operation Wednesday.
   ``It's not pretty, but it's working,'' said Robert Middleton, a
port spokesman.
   Cracks and other damage at one end of the main runway at
Oakland's airport were also being repaired. Passenger travel has
not been affected, Middleton said, but air freight carriers have
been told to lighten loads until the full length of the 10,000-foot
runway is usable again.
   Deukmejian on Wednesday ordered the immediate release of $122
million in emergency state funds to hard-hit localities to help
prevent ``cash-flow difficulties.''
   In San Francisco, parking officers went back to giving tickets
Wednesday. Some illegally parked cars were even towed, though Nancy
Lynch of the traffic department said, ``We're using plenty of
discretion.''

   An attorney who has handled more than 100
toxic shock syndrome lawsuits says two lawyers for a tampon maker
offered to pay him if he would stop taking such cases.
   Playtex Family Products Inc. signed a $500,000 consulting
agreement with another plaintiffs' lawyer who has stopped pressing
toxic shock cases, said the attorney, Mark B. Hutton.
   Hutton and a partner in his Wichita law practice won an $11.2
million civil award for the family of a woman who died of toxic
shock syndrome. It is one of hundreds of lawsuits around the
country seeking damages from makers of high-absorbency tampons,
which were linked to the rare and sometimes fatal infection by the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control in 1980.
   Hutton said he first was approached by Playtex attorney Charles
McCaghey in 1985 or 1986, when McCaghey's New York law firm was
coordinating the company's defense against the lawsuits.
   Hutton alleged that McCaghey offered him money in addition to
any settlement he might get for clients if he would refuse to take
future toxic shock cases.
   McCaghey, however, denied offering to pay Hutton to back off
toxic shock litigation.
   ``It's false, to my knowledge,'' McCaghey said Wednesday. ``I
never offered him anything to buy him off.''
   Hutton said he dismissed that approach and others later from
William H. Robinson of Richmond, Va., another lawyer for Playtex.
   ``I thought it was just cocktail talk,'' Hutton said. ``Lawyers
do a lot of jousting among themselves and teasing,'' Hutton said.
``I never took it seriously.''
   But he thought otherwise after learning another plaintiff's
attorney, J. Michael Liles of Fort Worth, Texas, accepted a
$500,000 five-year consulting deal with Playtex.
   Robinson said today he was unable to comment. ``I would like
very much to be able to respond, but because of pending litigation
I cannot.''
   ``Playtex never attempted to do anything unethical or buy
anyone's silence,'' said Playtex spokesman Martin Petersen today in
a statement issued from his Paramus, N.J., office.
   ``These allegations are being litigated in court and we are
confident that it will be proved the charges are baseless. Since
the matter is in litigation, we are unable to comment further.''
   Playtex and other manufacturers have stopped making the kind of
high-absorbency tampons linked to toxic shock syndrome, but
typically don't admit the tampons are to blame in settling damage
lawsuits.
   Liles said in a telephone interview Wednesday he hasn't done any
toxic shock syndrome consulting work yet for Playtex, some 10
months after he signed the agreement with the company. The
consulting contract doesn't have anything to do with toxic shock
cases, he said, refusing to discuss the terms of the agreement.
   ``This is a matter where people have brought my ethics into
issue and I haven't done anything unethical,'' Liles said Wednesday.
   Playtex said in a court brief in an Orange County, Calif., toxic
shock case that it is paying Liles ``for being available to consult
with it regarding toxic shock syndrome litigation.''
   One of Playtex's insurance companies, St. Paul Surplus Lines
Insurance Co., refused to pay Liles' $500,000 consulting for the
company. In a Dec. 28 letter to Playtex, the company said its
coverage didn't encompass such an agreement.
   ``In addition, we are concerned by the ethical considerations
and the long-term ramifications of an agreement of this nature,''
said the letter, which is part of the court file in a Delaware
Superior Court case involving a dispute among Playtex, Columbia
Casualty Co. and other insurance carriers.
   Hutton said he and the attorneys for Playtex never discussed how
much he might be paid.
   ``They didn't get specific with me because I didn't express an
interest,'' he said.
   Hutton said Liles had found a smoking gun Playtex didn't want
revealed. Before he settled a Texas case against Playtex, withdrew
from others and accepted the consulting arrangement, Liles
telephoned Hutton and said he had found a memo showing Playtex had
been planning to remove its super-absorbent tampons from the market
since 1983, Hutton said.
   That memo is part of the Delaware case record. In that action,
the insurance carriers claim Playtex fraudulently obtained recall
coverage and other policies by concealing vital information,
including long-standing plans to recall the product.

<TEXT>
   The desperate search for a 9-year-old boy
missing since Sunday with his pony in the rugged canyons of central
Oregon resumed at daybreak today but already poor weather worsened.
   Heavy snow was falling and the temperature was 20 degrees, said
Klamath County search and rescue spokeswoman Betty Lucht. Despite
the weather, around 300 searchers planned to continue looking for
Nathan Madsden on horseback and on foot, she said.
   Nathan was dressed in a slicker and chaps, and his mother, Sarah
Madsen, said earlier that she was confident he could take care of
himself.
   Nathan disappeared Sunday while herding cattle with his family
during an annual roundup. Relatives said the boy and his
10-year-old sorrel, Tony, surely stayed together.
   This week's snow, sleet and rain have erased any tracks the boy
and his horse may have left. Overnight temperatures have been
freezing four nights in a row.
   ``If he can stay with the horse and huddle with it, he's got a
chance. If he's a tough little cowboy, he may still be alive,''
said Klamath County Sheriff Carl Burkhart.
   Two helicopters and a C-130 transport plane were sent Wednesday
by the Air Force Reserve 304th Aerospace Rescue &amp; Recovery Squadron
based in Portland. They joined a Civil Air Patrol plane that began
searching Wednesday after being grounded all week because of
inclement weather.
   Sheriff's spokeswoman Becky Collins said today's poor weather
would keep the helicopters grounded.
   The search party grew to about 350 Wednesday from 70 on Monday
and volunteers continued to call from as far away as Richland,
Wash., Collins said.
   Searchers on foot and horseback covered 60 square miles
Wednesday, expanding beyond the 13-square-mile canyon searched
previously.
   Several searchers walked through an area called the ``bogs,''
filled with treacherous mud pits. One man sank to his waist Tuesday.
   ``Only a nearby log saved the guy from going all the way in over
his head,'' said Russ Herbison of the Lane County Sheriff's Posse.
``For obvious reasons, we want to be sure there are no signs of
Nathan having been in there.
   ``No one's giving up hope, and no one's going home,'' Herbison
said. ``We're going to find him.''

   The Chinese Foreign Ministry announced today that
former President Richard Nixon will arrive this weekend as a guest
of the government.
   The Chinese have regarded Nixon as a friend since he re-opened
bilateral relations by visiting as president in 1972.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing announced that Nixon
would arrive on Saturday but did not give any details of the
agenda. Nixon likely will see all the top Chinese leaders,
including senior leader Deng Xiaoping.
   Nixon's spokesman, John H. Taylor, said Monday in the United
States that Nixon would report to President Bush on his return
home. The White House said Bush looked forward to the report, but
stressed that Nixon was traveling as a private citizen.
   Bush banned high-level contacts with China after the Chinese
army attacked pro-democracy demonstrators in June, killing hundreds
and perhaps thousands.
   Nixon has visited China four times since his historic 1972 trip.

   Sudan's police commissioner and 51 senior
police officers were fired Thursday, according to Radio Omdurman
and informed sources.
   Police officers recently submitted a memorandum to the military
government, protesting interference of the army in police affairs
and demanding improvement in working conditions, the sources said.
   It was not immediately known if the firings were in response to
the memo.
   State-owned radio Omdurman reported that police commissioner,
Gen. Osman al-Shafei, had been promoted to major general and
relieved of his duties. The report gave no reason.
   Informed sources said 51 senior police officers also had been
fired. The government has not confirmed or denied this.
   The military government of Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan el-Bashir came
to power June 30 after overthrowing the civilian regime of Prime
Minister Sadek el-Mahdi. A mainly civilian cabinet has been formed
but the decision-making is controlled by el-Bashir and his 15-man
military council.
   A curfew and a state of emergency remain in effect.

   Hundreds of inmates ended a fiery
seven-hour uprising after the warden agreed to meet with a small
group about their complaints. Forty-four people were hurt during
the siege and the prison was heavily damaged.
   Eight guards were held hostage Wednesday in the state's second
prison rampage in two days.
   Corrections Department spokesman Ken Robinson said inmates would
remain locked in their cells until further notice and routine
prison operations were suspended.
   Robert M. Freeman, superintendent of the medium-security State
Correctional Institution at Camp Hill, said 1,200 of the prison's
2,600 inmates joined the riot at various stages.
   He planned to talk with five inmates today.
   A new rule barring inmates' families from bringing in homemade
food may have sparked the outbreak, said Freeman, who explained
that the rule was established to prevent contraband from slipping
into the prison.
   About 300 police officers and firefighters were sent to the
52-acre complex after the riot began Wednesday afternoon when an
inmate beat a prison staffer.
   Smoke permeated the air as police struggled to secure the prison
so firefighters could extinguish four blazes.
   Inmates demanded a press conference, changes in medical and
family visitation rules, and amnesty.
   John Palakovich, assistant to the superintendent, said the
uprising spread quickly to six cellblocks. Fires were started at
the prison furniture factory, a commissary, another food service
area and a gatehouse, he said.
   No damage estimate was immediately available.
   Officials said 35 injuries were confirmed among staff and
guards, including nine who were admitted to local hospitals, with
one of them in intensive care. Nine inmates were injured, with two
admitted to hospitals in fair condition.
   Using homemade weapons, inmates took the hostages but released
them within six hours.
   The prison in Camp Hill, 3 miles west of Harrisburg, is about 45
percent above capacity. Freeman said overcrowding was not mentioned
by inmates, but he added it might have been a factor in the riot.
   On Monday night, a three-hour rampage at the Huntingdon state
prison injured 29 staff members and 19 prisoners. Inmates took over
a cellblock and broke windows and furniture and set small fires,
authorities said. Huntingdon is about 100 miles west of Camp Hill.
   Freeman doubted a link existed between the two prison upheavals.
   ``But, sometimes you have a domino effect,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Exxon Corp. will move its headquarters from New
York City to Dallas next fall, the world's largest oil company
announced today.
   Chairman Lawrence Rawl said the company had considered moving
its headquarters for some time and had evaluated several locations.
   ``We concluded that, on balance, the Dallas area offered the
best combination of factors from the standpoint of our employees'
personal and professional lives and from an overall business
standpoint,'' he said.
   At least 300 headquarters employees will be affected by the
relocation.
   Exxon is the biggest energy company in the world and the
third-largest U.S. industrial company, with sales of more than
$87.5 billion in 1988.
   Its departure from New York reflects a trend of large companies
relocating in areas that are more affordable.
   Other leading U.S. companies historically based in New York also
have been leaving or expressed their intention to, partly because
of high costs. J.C. Penney &amp; Co. moved its headquarters from New
York to the Dallas area in 1987, saving about $60 million a year in
office and administration expenses.
   The Dallas-Fort Worth area is considered one of the most
attractive areas for corporate relocations. Fortune Magazine ranked
it as No. 1 for business in its Oct. 23 issue, calling it ``the
most diverse and dynamic economic base in the U.S.''
   Rawl did not specify how much money Exxon might save by the
relocation from New York, where it occupies leased space in a
54-story skyscraper in the heart of midtown Manhattan, one of the
most expensive pieces of real estate in the world.
   Exxon and Rockefeller Group Inc. sold the building in 1986 to a
large Japanese insurance conglomerate, Mitsui &amp; Co. for $610
million. At the time it was the largest single real estate
transaction in the city's history.
   Rawl said the company told employees ``the decision to relocate
the office was not taken lightly.''
   It was unclear why Exxon decided to move its headquarters at
this time, but the company has faced enormous cleanup costs
stemming from the March 24 oil spill in Alaska by a company tanker.
Exxon said recently that the cost would probably exceed $1.2
billion, with less than a third covered by insurance.
   Rawl said the company would be leasing temporary office space in
Dallas prior to moving into permanent offices to be constructed
about a mile from the Las Colinas complex, a large office
development in the Dallas suburb of Irving, close to the
Dallas-Fort Worth airport.

<HEAD>Judge Refuses To Delay Sentence So Woman Can Have Abortion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW PORT RICHEY, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has refused to postpone a
woman's 60-day jail sentence to allow her to get an abortion before
she is locked up.
   ``Do you want a continuance so you can murder your baby, is that
it?'' Pasco County Judge Dan C. Rasmussen asked Pamela Forney
before sending her to jail.
   Both defense and prosecution lawyers agreed Forney, who says she
begins her third month of pregnancy today, could postpone her
sentence by 10 days before serving her term for violaing probation
on a 1987 charge of driving under the influence.
   Ms. Forney, 26, asked for the additional time because she was
afraid it might be too late for a safe abortion when she got out of
jail.
   Ms. Forney pleaded with the judge, saying she is financially
unable to care for a baby. Rasmussen, however, suggested Monday
that she carry it full term and then give it up for adoption.
   ``I thought it was my choice,'' Ms. Forney said in a jail
interview Tuesday. ``He's telling me I don't have a choice. It's
not right that he can choose for me.''
   Ms. Forney, a part-time bartender who is not married, said she
doubts she'll have a job when she gets out of jail.
   Lee Cannon, attorney for the Pasco County Sheriff's Office, said
officials will have to have Ms. Forney medically evaluated and will
discuss their options at that time.
   ``We may go before the judge to seek an order to get the
procedure for her. We don't know yet,'' he said.

<HEAD>Number of Students Sent Abroad Unchanged For Now</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China is sending as many government-sponsored
students abroad this year as in past years but will make changes in
their criteria and where they are sent, an official said Thursday.
   The official did not comment on privately funded students. The
government is expected to enact new regulations that will sharply
limit their numbers.
   For all of 1989, 5,000 students are being sent abroad with
central government funds, the official Xinhua News Agency quoted
the unidentified official of the Overseas Students Service Center
as saying.
   It said this is the same number as were sent in each of the past
two years. In other recent statements, the government put the
number being sent annual at 3,000. The discrepancy could not
immediately be resolved.
   Xinhua noted the figure did not include students sent by local
governments or work units. It also does not include students who
find private sponsors or win scholarships from overseas colleges.
   ``Rational readjustment will be carried out this year in respect
to the percentage of students sent to various countries and the
composition of students,'' the official said.
   ``Improvement is needed in the selection of students. The
tendency to stress foreign language only while neglecting
comprehensive quality should be put right.''
   He did not elaborate, but education officials have said students
should show they are ideologically sound as well as academically
qualified. The government also has said it will send fewer students
for long-term degree programs, and more short-term visiting
scholars.
   China is concerned that many students sent overseas have failed
to return, and many of those who do return are filled with Western
economic and political ideas, such as democracy.
   The impact of this new policy has yet to be felt because many
students going abroad this year made arrangements well in advance.
There have been individual cases of students or older scholars who
planned to go overseas but have not been permitted to because of
suspected involvement in the crushed spring democracy movement.
   The State Education Commission has drafted new regulations that
would sharply cut the number of overseas students by requiring
college graduates to first work at least five years in China,
according to sources in the commission and at universities.
   The requirement would apply to students who find their own
financial sponsors or win scholarships from foreign schools. They
are estimated to number several thousand each year.
   The sources say the draft regulations are still being discussed
but likely will be approved next year.
   More than half of China's approximately 80,000 students abroad
are in the United States, and the rest are concentrated in Japan,
Australia and Canada.
   English is the second language studied by most college students.

<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
today announced a major plan to reduce nuclear weapons in the
Baltic Sea that will include the scrapping of Moscow's
nuclear-armed submarines there.
   In a goodwill gesture to northern Europe, the Kremlin chief said
the Soviet Union has removed all tactical nuclear missiles that
could strike the region and will take certain types of sea-launched
nuclear weapons out of the Baltic Sea.
   He made these announcements in remarks prepared for delivery to
1,500 Finnish politicians, businessmen and other invited guests.
   Gorbachev said the eventual goal was to rid the Baltic of
nuclear weapons.
   ``We are prepared to come to agreement with all the nuclear
powers and the Baltic states on effective guarantees for the
nuclear-free status of the Baltic Sea,'' he said.
   Gorbachev said the steps were being taken unilaterally and were
a follow-up to a speech he gave two years ago in the Soviet
northern port of Murmansk. Many of his proposals in that speech _
including a call for a nuclear-free zone in northern Europe _ were
dismissed by NATO.
   In Washington, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater
said, ``We do not believe nuclear-free zones contribute to security
in Europe.
   ``Most of these proposals have been designed to affect NATO
deterrence capability while leaving Soviet nuclear weapons
intact,'' Fitzwater said. ``On the other hand, we do appreciate the
intent of this and if it can develop into something concrete, why,
that might be a hopeful sign.''
   Gorbachev said the Soviet Union already has taken two of its
Golf-class submarines out of operation from the Baltic, and he
pledged to destroy the remaining four by the end of next year. The
nuclear missiles aboard the subs will also be destroyed and not
replaced, he said.
   Gorbachev did not specify which types of sea-launched nuclear
weapons the Soviets would remove from the Baltic Sea.
   The United States has expressed concern that removal of the
sea-launched missiles cannot be verified, and it has balked at
their inclusion in a superpower arms pact now being negotiated.
   In another announcement, Gorbachev said the Kremlin has agreed
to Norway's proposal to negotiate an agreement providing for mutual
notification of accidents involving ships, including
nuclear-powered submarines.
   Three Soviet nuclear-powered submarines have been involved in
accidents since April in the Barents and the Norwegian seas.
   Gorbachev's announcements came on the second day of a three-day
visit to Finland.

   Tokyu Department Store is negotiating to buy New
York's famed Bloomingdale's department store chain, news reports
said today.
   The Tokyo-based chain will likely buy Bloomingdale's for $1.3
billion from its current owner, Campeau Corp., a Canadian real
estate company, the economic newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun
reported.
   Tokyu officials were not available for comment today due to a
company holiday.
   Campeau spokeswoman Carol Sanger today declined to comment on
the Japanese news reports. She said Campeau has received
``expressions of interest'' in buying Bloomingdale's but she would
not say whether any formal bids had been made.
   An investment group formed and headed by Tokyu, which ranked
seventh in earnings last year among Japanese department stores, and
other investors will invest approximately $400 million in the
buyout, and the remaining $900 million will be covered by loans
from financial institutions, the newspaper said.
   Kyodo News Service reported that Campeau, which bought
Bloomingdale's last spring, later announced its intention to sell
the upscale department store chain due to its difficulties in
obtaining capital.
   But the real estate company had not yet reached agreement with
Tokyu on many details of the purchase, including price and the
manner in which the buyout would be completed.
   Owned by Campeau, which is reportedly in financial trouble,
Bloomingdale's presents a negative image to some banks and
investors, said the Nihon Keizai Shimbun report.
   Bloomingdale's, a popular American department store chain, has
17 stores mainly on the East coast of the United States, including
New York and Washington. Kyodo reported Bloomingdale's has annual
sales of about $1.2 billion.
   However, Kyodo quoted department store sources as saying the
deal was seen as involving risks for Tokyu, and said they
questioned Bloomingdale's past performance and profitability. It
did not elaborate.

   Coal miners in the northern Vorkuta region
returned to work today after a 24-hour strike demanding promised
benefits and political reforms, a spokesman said. Miners in the
Ukraine met to consider a walkout.
   Miners in Vorkuta, 950 miles northeast of Moscow, walked off the
job at midnight Wednesday in violation of a new law banning strikes
in such vital areas as energy, defense and transportation.
   ``Due to pressure from the local media and management's taking
the case to court, the regional strike committee made a decision to
end the strike at midnight'' today, Sergei Masolovich, a member of
the regional strike committee, said by telephone. He said hearings
on the strike had begun in regional court.
   The area's largest coalfield remained on strike, but the other
strikes were called off, Masolovich said. He said a total of 18,000
miners in nine of the region's 13 mines took part.
   In the Ukraine, miner representatives were meeting to consider
resumption of the massive strike that last summer paralyzed the
Donetsk coal basin, the country's largest coal producing region.
   Top Soviet officials have openly voiced concern that the miners'
actions, by cutting the nation's coal supplies, could force a
rationing of heat and light as the brutal winter begins.
   The miners were demanding delivery of benefits promised by the
government during a massive strike last summer, said Anatoly
Litvinenko, another strike committee member.
   First Deputy Premier Lev Voronin warned earlier this month that
power stations and public utilities have 4.5 million fewer tons of
coal on hand now than at this time last year due to the strikes.
   Miners in virtually every major Soviet coal field walked off the
job during the summer, demanding better consumer goods and working
conditions and more financial independence.
   Litvinenko said the miners now also are demanding political
changes, including elimination of Article 6 of the constitution,
which makes the Communist Party the ``leading and guiding force of
Soviet society,'' and barring the party's general secretary from
holding the job of president.
   Litvinenko said the miners want their demands to be debated by
the Supreme Soviet legislature and be put on the agenda of the next
Congress of People's Deputies, scheduled to be held before the end
of the year.
   He said the political demands were not aimed specifically at
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev but at constititional changes for
the future.
   The miners are calling for their demands to be debated by the
Supreme Soviet legislature and put on the agenda of the next
Congress of People's Deputies, scheduled to be held before the end
of the year.
   Alexei Bokharev, chairman of the Donetsk strike committee in the
Ukraine, said in a telephone interview the government was playing
bureaucratic games. They said that only three paragraphs in the
46-paragraph agreement reached over the summer had been fulfilled.
   ``The miners want exact dates when all (promises) will be
fulfilled,'' Bokharev said.
   He said miners will decide Friday on a course of action.
``Either the strike will be resumed or a conciliation commission
will be appointed,'' Bokharev said.
   On Monday, about 20,000 miners in the western Siberian mining
town of Mezhdurechensk staged a two-hour warning strike, declaring
that the government had failed to come through on some of the
promised benefits from the summer strikes.
   Local officials in Mezhdurechensk said the miners had shown
disrespect for the new law, but they took no other action.

   President Bush came under attack today from
environmentalists who said he isn't taking an aggressive leadership
role in worldwide efforts to combat global warming.
   Eleven environmental groups accused Bush of failing to live up
to election promises to confront the so-called ``greenhouse''
problem early in his presidency.
   ``We have great rhetoric but no leadership,'' Dan Becker of the
Sierra Club, declared at a news conference.
   He and the other environmentalists noted that during his
election campaign, Bush promised to tackle early in his presidency
the concerns of expected rising world temperatures because of
man-made pollution.
   ``In fact, the president has not even made clear who within the
government should be in charge of developing a national climate
policy,'' said Brooks Yeager, vice president for government affairs
at the Audubon Society.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We don't
believe progress has been slowed. The president has made whatever
decisions are necessary ... We feel that progress has been made.
   ``These are difficult issues that have long-term ramifications
in terms of costs and regulatory intrusion and those issues have to
be considered,'' Fitzwater said.
   The latest round of criticism was set off by reports of discord
within the administration over whether William K. Reilly,
administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, should attend
a meeting in the Netherlands on the problem of global warming.
   Reilly told reporters Wednesday he would head the U.S.
delegation to the conference attended by environmental ministers
from 68 nations, but that the United States wouldn't make any
specific commitment to curb ``greenhouse'' pollutants, chiefly
carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels.
   Administration sources confirmed, however, that Reilly's
attendance at the conference Nov. 6-7 was uncertain until just a
few days ago and that key White House advisers had suggested no
delegation be sent.
   Christopher Flavin, an expert on global warming issues for
Worldwatch Institute, said the flap was seen by many European
officials as further indication that the United States isn't
prepared to lead the effort to deal with global warming.
   ``This is a major meeting,'' Flavin said in an interview. ``It's
been in the planning stage for better part of a year. The United
States just doesn't have its act together.''
   The United States accounts for about one-fifth of the pollutants
linked to global warming.
   The environmental groups, including the Sierra Club, Audubon
Society, Natural Resources Defense Council, Friends of the Earth
and the Environmental Defense Fund, called on Bush to commit the
United States to a reduction of carbon dioxide emissions by 20
percent by the year 2000.
   Carbon dioxide is the chief pollutant causing global warming.
Sharp reductions _ or even stabilization _ would require
significant energy conservation including development of more fuel
efficient automobiles and appliances as well as other conservation
measures.
   Reilly declined Wednesday to discuss reports of discord within
the administration on the global warming issue.
   ``The president has made it very clear. We recognize the global
warming problem,'' he said.
   But Reilly said it would be premature to present a detailed
commitment for the reduction of greenhouse pollutants until after
``a whole range of questions'' are resolved, including the role of
developing nations.
   The Dutch government was expected to propose that nations, in
2000, freeze carbon dioxide emissions at current levels.
   Presidential advisers failed Friday to reach agreement on how to
respond to the Dutch proposal, prompting some members attending the
White House Domestic Policy Council meeting to suggest that Reilly
skip the conference, sources said.
   Reilly, the sources said, suggested at the meeting that the
United States might be the host of a conference next year to begin
negotiating an international convention on global warming. That
idea was met with strong opposition, the sources said.
   Bush on several occasions has expressed concern about the
greenhouse effect, and during his presidential campaign promised to
convene an international conference during his first year in the
White House.
   While Reilly has advocated an aggressive response to global
warming, other administration officials _ including the president's
science adviser, D. Allan Bromley, and Chief of Staff John Sununu _
have cautioned against moving too quickly.
   They argue a clear scientific consensus on the impact of the
greenhouse effect on global temperatures hasn't emerged.
   Furthermore, they maintain, the economic costs of dealing with
the problem _ primarily curbs on the use of fossil fuels _ may be
so significant that no action is warranted until the actual danger
is better known.

   Chippewa Indians rejected a $35.6
million offer to give up traditional spearfishing practices that
anger sport fishermen, prompting one tribal leader to remark, ``The
Great Spirit won.''
   The Indians of the Lac du Flambeau Reservation voted 439-366
Wednesday night against a state of Wisconsin proposal to settle a
dispute over a 19th century treaty that gives the tribe rights to
fish, hunt and cut timber off their reservation.
   The settlement would have paid each member of the Lac du
Flambeau band $1,800 cash this year and $1,200 in each of the next
10 years. The $35.6 million, 10-year settlement offer included $15
million in state and federal aid for Indian programs.
   ``I feel great,'' said tribe member Scott Smith, who joined the
drum-pounding, cheering opponents of the treaty outside the center
where the votes were counted. ``They saved our rights.''
   The Chippewas' annual spearfishing forays, during the spring run
of walleye pike, have become the focus of protest by non-Indian
sport anglers. They say Indians spearing fish in shallow water have
an unfair advantage over others, who must use rod and reel.
   The battle heated up this year after the state announced it
would reduce walleye pike catch limits for sport anglers. The cut
followed a federal court ruling the Chippewa could catch up to 100
percent of the number of the pike which biologists determine can be
safely taken from the lakes.
   Demonstrations against spearfishing erupted last spring, and 200
were arrested.
   Gov. Tommy Thompson called the rejected settlement, which would
have required the approval of the Legislature, the best hope of
ending friction in northern Wisconsin.
   ``It's done, it's dead,'' Thompson said. ``It had to be ratified
by the tribe or it's done. ... We're going to have to review all of
our options.''
   Lac du Flambeau Chairman Mike Allen said before the vote that
the band wouldn't resume negotiations with the state if the tribe
defeated the referendum.
   ``That's the end of the trail here for us. It's over right now.
The people made their choice,'' Allen said today.
   He predicted that one consequence of the vote will be more
violent protests next spring when tribe members leave the
reservation to spearfish again.
   ``I believe it's going to get worse,'' he said. ``It's been
getting worse every year and we anticipate it for this (next)
year.''
   Tribal attorney James Jannetta announced he was resigning
because defeat of the settlement he negotiated was a clear message
his services were no longer wanted.
   ``The Great Spirit won over tonight,'' said Thomas Maulson, a
former tribal judge and leading opponent of the settlement.
   Federal courts have ruled since 1983 that the state's six
Chippewa bands retain the hunting, fishing and gathering rights
under 19th century treaties that ceded northern Wisconsin to the
federal government.
   The Lac du Flambeau, with about 2,500 members, is traditionally
the most active Chippewa band in spearfishing.
   So far, the state has failed to reach treaty rights settlements
with any of the Chippewa bands. The Mole Lake band rejected a
proposed settlement in January.
   Tribal council member Dave Vetterneck said after the vote: ``The
people spoke for what they wanted. As far as I'm concerned, there
will be no more negotiations.''
   Opponents of the agreement demonstrated outside the tribe
center, and security was tight as votes were cast, but there were
no disturbances.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir today denied
reports that Israel provided technology for a nuclear-capable
missile that reportedly was test-fired in South Africa in July.
   Shamir told Israel Radio there was ``no truth'' to the NBC
television news report, which said Israel has been engaged in a
partnership with South Africa to develop nuclear missile capability.
   ``We totally deny this story,'' said Shamir's media adviser, Avi
Pazner. ``There is no nuclear link or cooperation between Israel
and South Africa.''
   South Africa's foreign minister, Pik Botha, said: ``I bear no
knowledge whatsoever of such cooperation.''
   In Washington, however, a U.S. official said today that South
Africa has test-fired an intermediate-range ballistic missile that
could carry nuclear warheads and was built with help from Israel.
   Israel and South Africa are also cooperating in development of a
long-range missile that can be used to launch reconnaissance
satellites into space, said the official, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The U.S. official said intelligence reports showed South Africa
had tested a modified version of the Israeli-made Jericho II
medium-range missile at Armaston, on the Indian Ocean coast near
Capetown last summer.
   Israel's Defense Ministry spokesman, Eitan Haber, said his
country is adhering to a March 18, 1987, Cabinet decision that no
new defense contracts between Israel and South Africa be signed.
   NBC cited unidentified intelligence sources and a CIA document
in its report.
   It said Israel provides missile technology to South Africa in
return for a continuous supply of enriched uranium for its own
nuclear warheads and the use of the Overberg long-range test site
in South Africa.
   The network said the Overberg site and a missile assembly
building there were built for both countries and that Israeli
engineers have worked there for several years.
   The first test resulting from the joint project took place July
5 when a missile flew 900 miles southeast from the test site, NBC
quoted the CIA paper as saying.
   The document identified the South African state arms maker
Armscor as the builder of the missile and said Israeli technology
was provided through Urdan Industries Ltd., based outside Tel Aviv,
NBC reported.
   Reached by telephone, a secretary at Urdan said the company's
director general, Yaacov Ben Bassat, was out of the country and
could not be reached for comment.
   The British newspaper The Guardian published a report in June
that South Africa was preparing to test a medium-range nuclear
missile developed in cooperation with Israel.
   Trade and Industry Minister Ariel Sharon defended the principle
of Israeli cooperation with South Africa, recalling South Africa's
help when Israel was facing Arab-inspired boycotts.
   ``But on this matter, we have a government decision and we are
acting in accordance,'' he said.

<HEAD>Spokesman Says Martial Law to be Lifted Soon in Beijing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Martial law, entering its sixth month in Beijing,
will be lifted soon, the People's Daily newspaper reported Thursday.
   ``I cannot offer a timetable,'' government spokesman Yuan Mu
told the newspaper. ``(Martial law) is for a limited time and it
seems that it will be lifted before very long.''
   He said the government already had reduced the scope of martial
law ``and will continue to do so'' as the capital becomes more
stable.
   Yuan spoke Wednesday with journalists from the Nihon Keizai
Shimbun, Japan's leading economic newspaper.
   He noted that many foreigners have urged martial law be lifted
in order to increase confidence in the government.
   ``We understand their feelings and will consider their
suggestion,'' he said, but added that China would not yield to
sanctions or other pressures. Although Western countries have never
listed conditions, diplomats say privately that they are unlikely
to resume normal relations with China until martial law is lifted.
   Premier Li Peng declared martial law in most of Beijing on May
20, when tens of thousands of college students occupied Tiananmen
Square in the city center and demanded democratic reform. However,
it was enforced only after June 3-4, when the army shot its way
into the city, killing hundreds and perhaps thousands of people.
   Under martial law, the army banned marches, strikes, class
boycotts, giving speeches, distributing pamphlets, spreading rumors
and ``other destructive actions.''
   It also banned foreign reporters from conducting interviews or
making tapes or shooting videotape on the streets or at government
offices, schools and factories. Enforcement of the ban has relaxed
since midsummer, but all interviews still must be approved by
martial law headquarters.
   Martial law has helped keep tourists away even though soldiers
are visible at only a few key places. They still guard Tiananmen
Square, and still occupy the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,
many of whose researchers were active in the protests.
   An undetermined number remain camped in several courtyards of
the former imperial palace, now a musuem. Soldiers also are posted
prominently in the university district.
   Squads of nearly 100 soldiers, four abreast, periodically jog
down Beijing's main street, their automatic weapons slung over
their shoulders.
   Gunfire still rings out at night, but there is never official
explanation. Residents claim at least some of the shots have been
civilian attacks on soldiers.
   Yuan also welcomed a recent statement by the French foreign
minister that France does not allow people on its territory to
conduct political activities against countries that France
recognizes.
   ``We hope France is as good as its word,'' Yuan said. However,
France has made similar statements in the past without strictly
enforcing the policy.
   China repeatedly has condemned France for giving haven to many
dissidents who fled China after the June crackdown.
   Yuan refused to comment on movement in Hungary and Poland away
from communism, but said socialist reform aims to improve and
develop the sociaist system, and ``cannot deviate from the track of
socialism.''
   On Monday, Li told the vice president of Yugoslavia's federal
Executive Council, Zivko Pregl, that China was greatly concerned
about events in some East European countries. But he said each
country must decide how to follow the socialist path.
   In internal debates, some Chinese theorists have begun referring
to Hungary and Poland as revisionist, meaning backsliders in the
socialist cause. But the word has not been used publicly.

<HEAD>Community Colleges Failing to Help Students Transfer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Community colleges ``salvage hope'' for poor
and minority students, but are failing to motivate them to go
beyond the two-year programs, according to a study released
Thursday.
   ``The transfer function of community colleges is in crisis,''
said the Academy for Educational Development report, which was
funded by the Ford Foundation and published by the College Board.
   Researchers Fred Pincus and Elayne Archer said two-year colleges
are a critical part of the educational system and have an important
role to play because they have taken ``on the awesome task of
working to salvage hope for so many who have been given up on by
others.''
   But the researchers said it is equally important that community
colleges work to ``provide paths of upward mobility'' by helping
students transfer to four-year colleges.
   Community or junior colleges usually are two-year institutions
established to serve a certain community and often emphasize
career, rather than academic programs. A large percentage of the
students are low-income or minorities, as well as students seeking
to upgrade skills with a few remedial or specialized courses.
   The report agreed with the American Association of Community and
Junior Colleges that those who attend a community college tend to
be economically better off than those who attend no college.
   But they pointed to a recent government report that showed the
average annual income of individuals with bachelor's degrees is
almost $6,000 higher than those with associate degrees and $7,464
higher than those with vocational certificates.
   The report, ``Bridges to Opportunity,'' said a small percentage
of community college students transfer to four-year schools and
fewer yet actually get bachelor's degrees. It said the transfer
rates are smaller for black, Hispanic, and Indian students than for
white and Asian-American students.
   Pincus said studies show that one-third to one-half of students
say they enrolled in a community college to prepare for transfer to
a four-year school.
   But he said the current transfer rate is 15 to 25 percent of all
community college students and 20 to 30 percent of those students
who say they want to transfer. Only 10 to 15 percent of all
community college students ever receive a bachelor's degree, he
said.
   To increase community college transfers, the report recommended
that:
   _Community colleges promote transfers by emphasizing both the
intellectual and economic benefits of attaining the bachelor's
degree.
   _Community colleges might consider requiring that at least 25
percent of a student's grade in any course carrying transfer credit
be based upon writing assignments involving some degree of critical
thinking.
   _Students who complete approved associate degree programs should
be guaranteed admission with junior status to any public four-year
institution in their state and not be required to repeat courses
taken in the community college.
   _States should develop financial incentives to reward community
colleges that have successful transfer programs and federally
funded scholarship programs should be created for low-income
students who transfer to four-year colleges.

   Crews clearing tons of wreckage left by a
huge plastics plant explosion found three bodies, bringing the
number of confirmed dead to five, and continued to search today for
17 people believed killed.
   Elsewhere, two industrial plant explosions in Wyoming and
Connecticut killed one man and injured 12.
   Investigators in Texas have not determined the cause of the
series of explosions Monday at the Phillips Petroleum Co. plant,
which produced 4.5 million pounds of plastic a day.
   At midday today, safety crews discovered a reactor leaking
hydrocarbon gas. Several reporters and television crews were asked
to move a few hundred yards back from the cleanup area.
   ``We asked the press to move back as non-members of the search
team,'' Phillips spokesman Scott Carlberg said. ``We are taking an
extremely conservative safety measure. But we see no danger of
explosion.''
   Even experts were surprised at the extent of the destruction,
apparently touched off somehow in leaking ethylene and isobutane
gas.
   ``It's total devastation,'' said Assistant U.S. Labor Secretary
John Scannell, who heads the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration.
   ``In 30 years of experience in the chemical industry, I've never
seen such massive equipment twisted and strung about,'' said
Scannell, who toured the plant on the Houston Ship Channel on
Wednesday.
   Fifteen OSHA investigators joined Phillips workers cleaning up
the plant and searching for the cause of the explosion.
   The clean-up continued around the clock, with big floodlights
illuminating the scene at night as workers used hydraulic shears,
cranes and other heavy equipment to cut through a tangle of metal
beams and pipes.
   Of the three bodies found Wednesday, two were near a storage
area for polyethylene pellets manufactured at the plant, said
company spokesman Bill Wicker. The third was in a maintenance area.
Two others were found Monday and Tuesday.
   An official of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers union said
plant employees had complained that staff shortages, long hours and
an abundance of workers from outside contractors could have caused
lapses in safety procedures.
   The official, Bob Wages, vice president of the OCAW's oil
section, didn't have specific safety complaints about the plant.
   ``It's symptomatic of what's going on in this industry,'' Wages
said of the complaints. ``I think companies are concerned about
safety, but I think they have competing interests: profit and
production.''
   A natural gas explosion in August killed a worker at the plant.
Union officials said the accident was an example of poorly trained
contract labor possibly endangering Phillips workers.
   Plant manager Robert Benz discounted any possible connection
between the use of contract workers and the two explosions. He said
contract workers get safety seminars twice a month.
   Scannell said the recovery of victims could take weeks. Part of
the problem is that when one piece of wreckage is moved, it sets
off a chain reaction of falling debris, he said.
   Outside Evanston, Wyo., a natural gas blast at an Amoco
Production Co. gas processing plant blew out a wall and threw
workers out of the building. One man was killed and 11 injured,
including five in serious condition today with burns, authorities
said.
   Investigators were trying to determine what caused natural gas
to leak from a compressor building, said Amoco spokesman Dick
Brewster.
   In New Haven, Conn., an explosion at a chemical and insulation
plant left one man with serious burns. The fire that followed the
blast at the Acme Division of the Allied Products Corp. was quickly
put out with dry chemicals stored inside the plant, said Fire Chief
John Riordan, who said the cause was under investigation.

   President Bush says he is ``not uptight''
about attending a multinational meeting with Daniel Ortega but
would be ``very firm'' if he encounters the Marxist president of
Nicaragua.
   The administration is renewing a trade embargo against Nicaragua
and complaining to the Soviets that Ortega is exporting revolution.
   ``I have no agenda with Mr. Ortega'' but ``we're not going down
there to have some battle with Mr. Ortega,'' Bush said in an
interview with Latin American journalists Wednesday, the transcript
of which was released today. ``I'm not uptight about his being
there.''
   Bush said ``what we don't want to do is inject a lot of regional
tensions into their meeting. But I'm going to be polite, charming _
if I did have an encounter (with Ortega), it would be very firm
because I don't see why that one Sandinista regime is swimming
against the tide'' of democracy.
   ``And everybody knows we have a tense relationship, so I don't
want to act like we're waltzing around there in great harmony,
because we're not,'' Bush said.
   Plans were abandoned for a group communique from the summit
participants on general themes of democracy and the environment,
which had been proposed by the host government for the meeting
Friday and Saturday of hemispheric leaders.
   ``The U.S. objected to signing any statement with Daniel
Ortega,'' said one senior administration official, adding that
other countries also had raised concerns about the document's
contents.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater acknowledged today
that ``that attitude was generally conveyed'' to the Costa Ricans
regarding Ortega. But he said, ``The Ortega aspect of this is being
totally overblown, at least in terms of our planning.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III on Wednesday criticized
Nicaragua in the face of claims by conservatives that Bush will be
giving a stamp of legitimacy to the leftist Sandinista regime by
attending the meeting with Ortega in Costa Rica.
   Baker, who also will attend the meeting in Costa Rica,
castigated the preparations for Nicaragua's Feb. 25 elections as
unfair to the Sandinistas' opposition, saying the opponents did not
have adequate access to the country's media.
   But Elliot Richardson, United Nations Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar's representative for monitoring the campaign, told
reporters Wednesday the Supreme Electoral Council ``has been
performing in a conscientious, fair and impartial manner.''
   ``It is certainly my impression, and I think that I speak for
all of us representing the United Nations in Nicaragua, that the
goal of a free, fair and honest election is being taken seriously
by all those concerned, in the government, in the parties, and
among the people,'' Richardson said.
   Baker also said Nicaragua is still shipping Soviet-bloc arms to
Marxist rebels in neighboring El Salvador, and called that a
``major problem'' despite repeated Soviet and Nicaraguan denials.
   The administration contacted the Soviets on Wednesday, Baker
said, to complain about the activity in light of Soviet assurances
that Moscow would urge a stop to such shipments.''
   Also Wednesday, Bush extended for another six months a U.S.
trade embargo against Nicaragua that was imposed by President
Reagan in mid-1985.
   He did it because Nicaragua poses ``an unusual and extraordinary
threat to national security and foreign policy of the United
States,'' Bush said in a statement to Congress.
   Bush must report to Congress twice a year on the status of the
embargo and on U.S.-Nicaraguan relations.
   Bush will be one of 18 heads of state attending the two-day
celebration of 100 years of democracy in Costa Rica. Participants
will all be seated around a common table for lunch, dinner and a
lengthy working session Friday.
   Administration officials say the president will not go out of
his way to be discourteous to Ortega but will not hold private
talks with him.
   ``I doubt he would refuse to speak if spoken to, but he's not
going to meet with him and he's not going to be extending any
particular courtesies in that direction,'' Baker told reporters at
the White House.
   Nicaragua has unsuccessfully sought talks with the United
States. The administration is trying to bolster opposition efforts
to win next year's elections.
   Bush and Ortega exchanged greetings and shook hands in 1986 at
the Guatemalan inauguration of President Vinicio Cerezo, when Bush
headed the U.S. delegation. They did not converse.
   Bush also will meet in Costa Rica with Ortega's election
opponent, Violeta Chamorro, at a breakfast for political leaders.

   A China Airlines' Boeing 737 carrying 54
people crashed into a mountain and burned today just after taking
off from the eastern city of Hualien, and all aboard were feared
dead, officials said.
   All on board were Taiwanese except for a passenger identified as
a businessman from California. The airline gave his name as J.
Wayne Phillips, 46, a vice president of Universal Paint Corp. in
City of Industry, outside Los Angeles. A company secretary said
Phillips was in Taiwan on business.
   The jet was en route from Hualien to Taipei, 93 miles away.
Witnesses on a nearby highway said they could see the flames from
the wreckage.
   Hualien police said about 130 rescuers rushed to the crash site
near Chia Min, a village of about 2,000 people. The site was
accessible only by foot. It was expected to take them hours to
reach the plane, and they were slowed by rain and darkness.
   The jet left Hualien at 6:54 p.m. and crashed five minutes
later, according to officials of the airline, Taiwan's national
flag carrier. It said there were 47 passengers and seven crew
members. Airline spokesman Lodge Lo said all were believed killed.
   Airline officials had earlier said that there were 49 passenger
aboard the aircraft.
   It was raining when the plane took off, but the cause of the
crash was not known.
   The airline quoted Hualien control tower officials as saying
they instructed the plane to turn right and fly over the sea, but
the jet turned left over land instead. No explanation was given.
   A witness, who identified himself Li Yi-chang, told radio
reporters he saw the plane hit the mountain and explode.
   In Seattle, where Boeing is based, Boeing Commercial Airplanes
spokesman Tom Cole identified the aircraft as a 737-200 delivered
to China Airlines in December 1986. He had no other details.
   ``We still cannot figure out why the accident happened. The
plane is only two years old and it was in good condition,'' Lo said.
   Taiwan's worst air disaster was in 1981, when 110 people died in
the crash of a Far Eastern Air Transport Boeing 737.

<HEAD>Mitchell Says Aid Will Be Delayed By Decision to Inject Capital Gains</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Top 8 grafs new to include White House reaction. Picks up 7th

<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Aid to Poland and Hungary will be delayed and
perhaps killed by a Republican attempt to inject capital gains tax
reductions into the aid debate, Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell said today.
   ``Obviously the capital gains issue has nothing to do with aid
to Eastern Europe,'' the Maine Democrat told the Senate.
``Obviously the only effect can be to delay and perhaps kill aid to
Poland and Hungary.''
   He called the GOP's decision to inject capital gains into the
aid debate one of a series of ``unwise and almost baffling'' steps
that President Bush and the Republicans have taken.
   But Republican leader Bob Dole accused Democrats of injecting
partisan politics into the debate over the size of the aid package
and said Republicans had no choice but to seek action on capital
gains on every possible bill.
   ``Options on this side for at least a look at capital gains are
shrinking daily,'' the Kansas Republican said. ``It finally
occurred to us that if we didn't act on this bill we would be shut
out entirely.''
   Sen. Robert Packwood, R-Ore., introduced the capital gains tax
reduction bill as an amendment to the aid package during debate
Wednesday night.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater offered a
less-than-enthusiastic endorsement of Packwood's strategy, saying
the administration was ``generally supportive'' of his proposal.
``We're willing to go along with it.''
   Fitzwater said the decision to link capital gains with aid to
Poland and Hungary was made on Capitol Hill, and that the
administration did not have much advance warning about it.
Stressing that the administration wants a vote on a capital gains
tax cut, Fitzwater said, ``We're certainly willing to see what
happens.''
   Dole contended that while Republicans will ``stand our ground''
on the capital gains issue, the delay will not affect aid to Poland
and Hungary over the long run.
   But it will have the beneficial effect of further focusing
attention on the wisdom of adopting a costly Democratic plan to
provide nearly $1 billion in aid to Poland and Hungary over three
years, the GOP leader said.
   Dole asserted that the less costly Republican approach has more
safeguards against funneling the money to ``failed socialist
enterprises.''
   ``We are not reducing our sympathy to Poland or to the
Solidarity movement,'' Dole said. ``We are not denying anything to
Poland,''
   But Mitchell said leaders of Poland's non-communist government
``have stressed the importance of prompt action as much as the
nature and level of the assistance itself.''
   Noting that winter is coming on, that food shortages persist and
that inflation is skyrocketing, Mitchel said: ``This is one of
those cases where assistance provided too late will be of no
assistance at all.''
   ``The administration has made clear that it believes the capital
gains reduction is more important than aid to Poland and Hungary,''
Mitchell said.
   ``Surely the brave leaders of Solidarity who have struggled so
hard to restore democracy to Poland know that this assistance is
needed in a timely fashion,'' he said.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont and other Democrats said the
president has offered Eastern Europe encouragement but no real or
solid commitment as it begins to move away from communism and
toward democracy and free enterprise.
   ``Why is this administration so willing to commit billions for
war but only small change for peace?'' Leahy asked.
   Republicans contended no solution will be found to Poland's
serious economic problems by ``throwing money'' at them, and that
the GOP's less costly approach is the more responsible, practical
and prudent course.
   Dole accused Democrats of an ill-advised and risky attempt to
flood Eastern Europe with U.S. taxpayer dollars.
   ``We have to be very careful and pragmatic about what we propose
to do,'' Dole said. ``There should not be a contest about how much
money we can drag out of the U.S. Treasury.''
   But even some Republicans endorsed the costlier Democratic aid
measure as an essential step.
   ``Events are changing quickly, and we must change our policies
with equal speed,'' said Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H. ``We must
grasp this opportunity before it slips away. I say let's go for it
and go for it aggressively.''
   The Republican version of the three-year authorization would
provide a total $585 million, more than $100 million over the $451
million assistance proposed by Bush.
   The Democrats, however, seek approval for $989 million in aid
over the three-year period, nearly $150 million more than the $840
million approved by the House last week.
   Their measure includes $125 million in food aid, $200 million in
currency stabilization loans, $200 million in trade credit
insurance guarantees, $40 million in environmental aid and $320
million for Poland and $80 million for Hungary to promote
development of private enterprise.

<HEAD>Tagliabue Named NFL Commissioner</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyer Paul Tagliabue was elected commissioner
of the National Football League today to replace Pete Rozelle, who
said seven months ago that he wanted to retire.
   Owners of the 28 NFL franchises broke a deadlock over the
selection by appointing a five-man committee Wednesday night to
recommend a choice. Dan Rooney of the Pittsburgh Steelers, chairman
of the committee, said it unanimously recommended Tagliabue for a
five-year term.
   Tagliabue, 48, is an NFL counsel and has been a league insider
for 20 years.
   An early favorite for the job, New Orleans Saints president Jim
Finks, issued a statement congratulating Tagliabue.
   ``He will be an oustanding commissioner, and should serve the
NFL for many years to come,'' Finks said.
   Art Modell of the Cleveland Browns, a Finks supporter, said
Finks turned down an offer to be president of the NFL in charge of
football operations.
   ``The intention was to bring both Paul Tagliabue and Jim Finks
into leadership roles,'' Modell said.
   Gene Upshaw, executive director of the NFL Players Association,
said players were glad to see the selection process completed. He
described Tagliabue as a problem solver.
   ``We've met in the antitrust arena and on issues including drug
testing,'' Upshaw said in Washington. ``I find him to be very
straightforward and he wants to solve problems. He understands
things have to be done and has never been opposed to taking action
to solve problems.''
   Tagliabue has left his Washington office for Cleveland when the
selection was announced and could not be reached for comment today.

<HEAD>Few Happy With Education Minister's Decision on Moslem Scarf</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>
<UNK>Associated Press Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The education minister fired another shot in the
Scarf War by deciding Moslem girls can wear Islamic head coverings
to school, and a newspaper said Thursday he was trying to
``reconcile the irreconcilable.''
   At issue is the law barring religion from French public schools,
and to some extent the situation of immigrants.
   Education Minister Lionel Jospin appeared bent on satisfying
everyone in his comments to Parliament on Wednesday and in a
magazine interview published Thursday, but in the end seems to have
satisfied hardly anyone.
   Roman Catholic, Moslem and Jewish leaders in France generally
see no harm in the wearing of religious symbols to class, but in
political circles the secularity of schools is nearly a religion in
itself.
   The controversy began this month when three girls in a town
north of Paris decided to wear ``hijab'' scarves covering hair,
ears and neck to their junior high classes. The principal said they
could not, that doing so amounted to proselytizing in school, which
is illegal.
   Jospin told Parliament that school authorities should try to
persuade the students and their families to ``respect the
secularity of the school,'' but if that failed, ``the school must
accept and welcome them.''
   He also stressed, however, ``the firm and absolute refusal that
must be applied to all proselytism.''
   Teachers' unions were particularly unhappy and some members of
Jospin's own Socialist Party were clearly discomfited.
   In an interview with Le Nouvel Observateur, published Thursday,
the minister said: ``There is no threat to the French Republic by
fundamentalist Islam. If this republic doesn't know how to respond
in a humanitarian way to a handful of young girls wearing scarves,
I would be worried.''
   Liberation, a leftist daily, described Jospin as ``a minister of
education, alone in the tempest, abandoned even by part of his own
(party), who is trying to reconcile the irreconcilable.''
   It said the conservative opposition was tempted to take up the
issue, ``but doesn't quite know how to grab it.''
   Le Quotidien de Paris, a conservative paper, said Jospin's
decision ``is both against tradition and against the law.''
   Church and state were officially separated in this largely
Catholic country in 1905. Public schools are required to be
completely neutral about religion.
   ``This business is going to have many consequences because we
have begun a process of confrontation with Islam of which we are
seeing only the first symptoms,'' said Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of
the extreme-right National Front party, which opposes immigration.
   ``I say that the right to wear a religious symbol must be total
on the condition that it is discreet,'' he said, ``but the chador
is more than that; it is a provocative proclamation, and that we
cannot accept.''
   In the debate, many people use the terms veil, chador and scarf
interchangeably. The item in question is a simple scarf covering
only the hair, while the chador is an ankle-length cloak.
   Yannick Simpron, head of the National Education Federation, the
largest teachers' unions and a pillar of Socialist Party support,
said he was waiting for written instructions from the Education
Ministry.
   ``Lionel Jospin proposes to negotiate in cases of wearing the
Islamic veil, but, says the minister, if at the end of the
discussions the families do not agree to give up this religious
symbol, the child must be accepted,'' Simpron declared. ``Where is
the margin for negotiation when the outcome is known?``
   Some see the wearing of scarves as an attempt to slow the
emancipation of Moslem women, not just a religious custom.
   In Parliament, Jospin said: ``For these young Moslem girls,
school is their only chance to emancipate themselves. They have no
other alternative.''
   Among those welcoming his decisino was radical lawyer Jacques
Verges, who represents several Moslem families.
   ``We won,'' he said in an interview. ``Secularity means the
neutrality of teachers, not the neutrality of students. The law
calls for the prohibition of all proselytism. It does not talk
about living a faith.''

<HEAD>Study Finds Climate Warming in Tibet</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The chilly climate of Tibet has been warmer
over the past half-century than at any time in thousands of years,
a team of scientists sponsored by the National Science Foundation
reported Thursday.
   The analysis of ice collected in remote north-central Tibet
revealed what the scientists termed a ``striking'' warming in that
region since the 1940s.
   Their report, in the journal Science, is based on the different
types of oxygen that collect in ice at different temperatures. It
does not include estimates of actual temperature changes in Tibet.
   The study was conducted by researchers from the Byrd Polar
Research Center at Ohio State University, the Chinese Institute of
Glaciology and Geocryology and the University of Copenhagen,
Denmark.
   They compared the various isotopes of oxygen in accumulated ice
to analyse temperature changes in Tibet over the past 6,000 to
8,000 years, and concluded that the readings suggest recent
temperatures are the warmest.
   A connection with any ``greenhouse effect'' global warming has
not been established, the researchers said.
   The term ``greenhouse'' warming refers to a possibility of
rising temperatures worldwide that has many researchers concerned
about disruptive changes in world climate.
   Another report on that topic appeared Thursday in the British
Journal Nature, where researchers concluded that the world's oceans
and seas did not show significant warming from 1982 to mid-1988,
contradicting earlier reports.
   The reports of warming in Tibet but none in the oceans could be
consistent with one another, however.
   James E. Hansen of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, a leading spokesman on the global warming issue,
has estimated that if greenhouse warming is taking place the large
land masses would be affected sooner and more strongly than the
oceans.
   Thus, an area such as Tibet, landlocked in the largest
continent, could be expected to record a warming before any of the
world's oceans, which absorb heat and change temperature much more
slowly than does the land.
   The greenhouse warming, according to scientists, could result
from the gradual increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere due
to industrial processes. The fear is that this gas would trap heat
somewhat like a greenhouse, causing temperatures to rise.
   However, other scientists question this theory and urge more
research before taking any actions to halt the threatened climate
change.

<TEXT>
   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees,
Jean-Pierre Hocke, resigned today amid an investigation focusing on
his use of U.N. money for first-class air travel.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar accepted Hocke's
resignation effective Nov. 1, said U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani.
   Hocke, a Swiss, was in New York as his resignation was
announced. His letter to Perez de Cuellar, read by Giuliani, said
in part:
   ``At a time when you have decided ... to prolong and intensify
an investigation which you initiated, I do not wish my presence at
the head of HCR to complicate in any way the ongoing
investigation.''
   The high commissioner serves a three year term. Hocke won the
post in 1986 as the favored candidate of the U.S. State Department
and won reinstatement in January.
   The commissioner is officially responsible for at least 12
million refugees worldwide, though there are many more than that.
   Hocke's four-year tenure was plagued by allegations of
mismanagement and favoritism to the major donor nations, which
include the United States.
   His latest problem erupted in September, when Swiss television
reported he used a special ``educational fund'' set up by Sweden
and Denmark to upgrade his air travel to first-class.
   Hocke admitted he had flown first-class, a right reserved only
for Perez de Cuellar under stringent U.N. austerity measures, but
he denied impropriety.
   The commission is struggling with a shortfall of at least $40
million in its budget this year.
   The Swiss television report said internal documents showed Hocke
had drawn $300,000 dollars since 1987 from the special
``educational account'' to upgrade his flights from business to
first-class.
   Hocke said in late September that he had flown first-class on
some long intercontinental flights when he had a busy work schedule.
   The fund was established in the late 1960s, and is replenished
by Sweden and Denmark.
   On Tuesday, Danish Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen said
that Hocke told officials that the UNHCR's fund-raising director,
Ole Volfing, told him Danish authorities had approved the fund for
travel costs.
   In recent years, Hocke has been criticized by his staff and
private refugee relief groups for not challenging the increasingly
restrictive asylum policies of the United States, West Germany, and
other major donors to the refugee commission.
   In January 1988, Hocke ordered the burning of all 138,000 copies
of the agency's official monthly magazine ``Refugees'' because it
contained an article critical of West Germany's refugee policy.
   Hocke said the article was out of date and West Germany's
policies were improving, but the ``book burning'' image engendered
by the move greatly embarrassed Bonn.

<DATELINE>BUTZBACH, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on
Thursday welcomed political reforms in the Soviet Union but said
the Cold War can't be declared over because of the Kremlin's
military might.
   Cheney toured the U.S. Army's infantry training site in the
central West German town of Butzbach, at the start of a three-day
visit to West Germany.
   ``I look at the developments in the East with, I think, a kind
of hope and optimism that we may in fact be at the beginning of a
new era, if you will, in international relations,'' Cheney said.
   ``But I think it's far too soon for us to declare that the Cold
War has ended or that peace is at hand,'' he said.
   The Soviets' strategic nuclear capability is ``more robust
today'' than when Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to power in March 1985,
Cheney said. He said he has to deal with the ``reality of military
power.''
   ``That reality today is that the Soviet Union is still the only
nation in the world that has the power to destroy the United
States,'' he said.
   Cheney arrived by helicopter at a huge, open range covered with
dust and tread marks.
   There he received a briefing on the defensive strategy of a
platoon of four Bradley fighting vehicles, tank-like weapons
capable of firing missiles and outfitted with a 20mm gun.
   The Bradley had been plagued by criticism that it was unable to
operate in water as designed. However, Army officials say those
problems have been fixed.
   Cheney received a briefing from 2nd Lt. Curt Carney, 24, of
Boise, Idaho, of the 1st Brigade of the 3rd Armored Division.
   Carney described his platoon's strategy and explained how he
works with Army heavy equipment operators who dig huge holes with a
ramp-like exit that let the Bradley hide most of its bulk
underground.
   At one point, Cheney climbed onto the Bradley to shake hands
with the young crew members.
   Standing before the combat-ready crew, Cheney praised U.S.
military personnel as being ``some of the most talented and
dedicated men and women we've ever had in uniform.''
   ``We welcome the effort of Mr. Gorbachev to seek to reform the
Soviet Union. Hopefully, he will be successful,'' Cheney said.
``Hopefully, that success will result in a Soviet Union that is
less hostile, less threatening to the West than has been true for
the last 40 years.''
   He said there were signs of reductions in Soviet conventional
naval forces, but said he would speculate that ``the new units
coming in will be more capable than the old ones going out, which
is, after all, the way we operate as well.''
   ``We're pleased with the announcement by the Soviets of an
intention to reduce conventional armaments unilaterally in the
East,'' he noted.
   Cheney was asked about disclosures from U.S. intelligence
sources that the Soviets were deploying two new kinds of advanced
nuclear-tipped missiles around Moscow as part of a vastly upgraded
defense of the capital.
   Cheney said he was not aware of any specific developments, but
said such a system was already in place and is allowed under terms
of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
   Cheney also responded to a Soviet offer to curtail foreign
bases, saying the United States also was ``looking at base
structure, especially in a time of tight budgets.'' He noted that
U.S. military operations at Torrejon in Spain were based phased
out, at the request of the Spanish government.

<HEAD>Outgoing Civil Rights Chairman Says Bush Needs to Speak Up</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The chairman of the U.S. Civil Rights
Commission said Thursday he resigned as head of the panel to give
President Bush an opportunity to set the administration's civil
rights agenda and name a new chairman.
   ``It is time for the new administration which has been too
reticent to give forth, to speak to the question and make clear
what it has to contribute to the debate on civil rights,'' William
B. Allen told a news conference at the National Press Club.
   Allen, whose tenure at the agency has been marked by
controversy, said he could not speak for the administration because
``I have not had a single conversation with President Bush'' since
his election last year.
   ``President Bush alone can tell the country where he stands and
what he has to contribute,'' he added.
   By naming a new chairman, Bush could ``give a particular signal
of the mark with which he chooses to stamp the agency,'' Allen said.
   The White House revealed last week that Bush had accepted
Allen's resignation from the commission. Asked to comment Thursday,
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said only, ``We accept
his resignation.''
   Allen had said last March the president would have to ask him
personally to resign his post after reports that Bush had planned
to replace him with Arthur A. Fletcher, a moderate Republican and
one of Bush's early black political supporters.
   Allen distributed copies of the letter of resignation he had
sent to the White House, dated Sept. 9.
   Attached was a terse one-sentence letter from Bush, dated Oct.
16, saying only: ``I accept your resignation as chairman of the
United States Commission on Civil Rights, effective immediately.''
   In his letter, Allen, who is black, challenged Bush to reduce
civil rights litigation and ``to turn our country around, away from
its conscious discouragement of American blacks in particular from
relying upon and profiting from the justice of our courts of law.''
   Allen said Bush should work to simplify civil right law, ``which
now probably stands second only to our tax code for ambiguities,
complexities, and internal contradictions.''
   Allen's tenure as chairman of the panel has been marked by
confrontation with other commissioners and public incidents such as
his arrest at gunpoint when he intervened in a custody battle over
an Indian girl.
   Allen, a professor of government at Harvey Mudd College in
Claremont, Calif., was appointed chairman of the commission in June
1988, after the death of Clarence Pendleton.
   Allen came under fire from fellow commissioners recently for a
speech titled ``Blacks? Animals? Homosexuals? What is a Minority?''
he delivered earlier this month before a conservative coalition.
   In a 6-1 vote, the commission branded the speech ``thoughtless,
disgusting and unnecessarily inflammatory.''
   ``I do not believe in coddling people,'' said Allen in defending
his leadership style.
   ``My predecessor in the office, I'm afraid, wore himself out
holding the hands of his colleagues and trying to patch together a
consensus, which really existed as nothing more than a paper
consensus.''
   Saying he felt a ``moral obligation as the only conservative''
on the panel, Allen said he would continue to serve on the
commission. His six-year term expires Dec. 1, 1992.
   Commission Vice Chairman Murray Friedman will act as the head of
the agency until Bush appoints a new chairman.

<HEAD>Reagan Thanks Japanese for Aid to California Quake Victims</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ronald Reagan met Thursday with 13 university
students who have volunteered to help Californians clean up after
the earthquake, and said they were among the ``most inspiring''
young people he had ever met.
   The former president had no official appearances scheduled for
Thursday. His wife, Nancy, was interviewed on a television network
owned by the Fujisankei Communications Group, which engaged the
Reagans for the nine-day visit and is reported to be paying them $2
million.
   Fujisankei, Japan's largest media conglomerate, has not
confirmed the fee, but company officials have said the visit is
costing about $7 million.
   The Reagans and their Japanese hosts have used the opportunity
to praise the close ties between the two nations, and have avoided
mentioning thorny trade problems.
   Of his encounter with the Chuo University students, Reagan said:
   ``I have just met with one of the most inspiring groups of young
people I have ever encountered. Their trip to San Francisco is a
most eloquent statement about the special friendship between the
people of Japan and the people of the United States.''
   In her TV interview, Mrs. Reagan said: ``We're very grateful to
the Japanese people for what they've done, for the assistance
they've given'' since the earthquake struck last week.
   Japanese companies and individuals are reported to have pledged
$7 million in aid. Several groups of Japanese, like the Chuo
students, have volunteered to help repair the damage.
   After the meeting with Reagan, a student with short hair smiled
and said: ``He pointed at my head and commented that we had similar
haircuts.''
   Reagan's head was shaved when he underwent surgery Sept. 8 to
drain fluid from his brain because of an injury suffered while
riding horseback in July.
   ``Everyone tells him that he looks much younger, that he looks
about 16 years old,'' Mrs. Reagan said of her husband's hair style.
``But I'm having a little bit of a hard time getting used to it.''
   Reagan used two days of the visit to meet with current and
former Japanese government officials, but devotes most of his time
to appearances arranged by Fujisankei.

<HEAD>West German Ambassador to Poland Resigns, Citing Exhaustion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Germany's ambassador to Poland
has resigned because of stress from the recent East German refugee
exodus and the upcoming visit of Chancellor Helmut Kohl to Warsaw,
officials said Thursday.
   Franz Joachim Schoeller has been granted early retirement after
complaining of exhaustion, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Juergen
Chrobog.
   Chrobog denied rumors in Warsaw that Schoeller, 63, was
pressured into resigning. ``That is absolutely untrue,'' said
Chrobog.
   But the West German visit to Poland _ the first by a federal
chancellor in more than a decade _ and the moves toward
reconciliation of the former World War II enemies has been an
emotionally and politically charged issue for the Bonn leadership.
   Chrobog said Schoeller cited ``the stress of recent times'' in
asking to be allowed to go on pension on medical grounds.
   Schoeller said he and the embassy staff had been overtaxed by
preparations for Kohl's Nov. 9-14 visit, and by the arrival of
several thousand East German refugees at the embassy.
   At least 3,000 East Germans who escaped to Poland or refused to
return from authorized trips appealed to the West German Embassy in
Warsaw for help in emigrating, and were sheltered there and at
other buildings at the disposal of the diplomats. About 2,000
refugees remain in Warsaw awaiting the Bonn government's help in
getting to West Germany.
   Chrobog declined to say who would replace Schoeller, but said
the Polish government has agreed to a speedy succession because of
the pending summit and the extra workload caused by the refugees.
Well-informed sources in the Bonn government, who asked not to be
identified, said Schoeller would be replaced by the current
ambassador to Chile, Guenter Knackstedt.
   Schoeller, a career diplomat, had been ambassador to Poland for
two years.
   His resignation was effective immediately.
   Under the government's pension system, officials can take early
retirement for health reasons after age 62.
   Kohl's trip to Poland had been put off repeatedly because of
differences between the two governments and the change in
leadership in Poland this summer.
   There had also been broad differences of opinion within the Bonn
leadership coalition about the lengths to which West Germany should
go to reconcilewith Poland, whose invasion by Nazi Germany on Sept.
1, 1939, touched off World War II. West Germany and Poland have
never signed a peace treaty.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, a member of the liberal
Free Democratic Party that is the junior partner in the Bonn
coalition, reportedly favored more generous offers of West German
aid during the early stages of negotiations between the two nations.
   Kohl, leader of the conservative Christian Democrats, put his
senior foreign affairs adviser, Horst Teltschik, in charge of the
reconciliation talks, rather than leaving them to Genscher's
diplomatic staff.
   The talks stalled several times early this year and were
suspended during the leadership transition in Poland over the
summer.
   A broad agreement resolving all outstanding problems between
Poland and West Germany was reached on Oct. 3, clearing the way for
Kohl's visit.

<HEAD>Building Supplies Arrive, Officials Concerned More Needed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three railroad boxcars of plywood from
the Pacific Northwest arrived Thursday in what officials called the
largest single donation of building materials since Hurricane Hugo
struck.
   But as shipments of relief supplies begin to taper off five
weeks after the storm, Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. said he is
concerned about meeting the needs of a rebuilding effort that could
take as long as two years.
   ``The city is coming back but the great problem is housing,''
Riley said. ``We're going to be rebuilding homes in the aftermath
of Hugo for a couple of years. We need money and building supplies
in tremendous quantities.''
   The storm destroyed 3,437 homes and caused major damage to
13,757 in the Charleston area, said Howard Chapman, who is
coordinating the city's relief effort.
   Local homebuilders could build only about 8,000 new homes in the
Charleston area in a year, Chapman said.
   ``That gives you an idea of the magnitude of how long it's going
to take,'' he said.
   ``It's going to take a long, long, time,'' Riley agreed.
   The donated plywood will be used to repair homes both in
Charleston and outlying areas hard-hit by Hugo, which smashed into
the state with 135 mph winds on Sept. 21.
   The materials will be used in part by Charleston's Heartline
program and Charleston County's Raise the Roof Program in which
volunteers help make repairs to damaged homes for those who can't
afford such repairs.
   ``The classic example would be the poor family which has no
insurance _ they don't have insurance because they don't have a lot
of things. In some instances, insurance was hard to get because
they were in a rural area that didn't have a fire department,'' the
mayor said.
   Some people may be eligible for money from the Federal Emergency
Management Agency and in those cases ``what we're trying to do is
fill the gaps,'' Riley said.
   The boxcars of plywood were shipped by a group known as the
Oregon Lands Coalition, which represents 10 organizations in both
Washington and Oregon, said Rita Kaley of Hood River, Ore.
   ``We really want it to go to the people in need, but of course
everyone is in need right now,'' she said.
   Part of the shipment was donated by Stevenson Co-Ply Inc. of
Stevenson, Wash., and one of the boards was autographed by workers
at the plant.
   Above the signatures was a message which read: ``Our thoughts go
with you in your crisis.''

   The talk will be of butter knives and dessert
forks _ not slam dunks and full-court presses _ when the University
of Georgia basketball team goes to etiquette school this weekend.
   Sunday's two-hour class will be taught by Debra Lassiter, a
Georgia graduate who owns an Athens business called Perfectly
Polished. She said she was inspired to teach the Bulldogs some
manners after watching a swimming team from another school eat at a
local restaurant.
   ``Their eating skills were atrocious. I thought, `These people
are representing their university. Do we send out athletes like
this?''' she said.
   Coach Hugh Durham said he is excited about his players and
coaches taking the class.
   ``How many people actually are comfortable when they go to a
banquet or a sit-down, full-course dinner? How many people actually
know what they are supposed to do?'' he said. ``If you don't feel
comfortable, you can't enjoy it.''
   On Nov. 5, the Bulldogs will have a formal dinner at the Georgia
Center for Continuing Education to practice their new manners.

   Ed Schwieder might not go to any lengths
to get his name in the funny papers, but his kids will.
   The Pogo cartoon strip in Thursday's newspapers proves it. The
cartoon culminates an effort begun 34 years ago by four of
Schwieder's children.
   His oldest daughter, Sandy Hampe, who at the time was 15, wrote
in 1955 to Pogo creator Walt Kelly to see if Kelly would put her
father's name on the familiar swamp dweller's skiff in the strip.
   Kelly, now dead, wrote back at the time that the request would
be placed on a ``long, long list.'' The family renewed its request
when it stumbled on Kelly's letter last summer, and one of the
cartoon's creators, Larry Doyle, replied in the affirmative.
   Thursday's cartoon strip featured a skiff with ``S.S.
Schwieder'' emblazoned on its port side and ``Honest Ed'' astern.
   ``I'm tickled to death,'' said Schwieder, a semi-retired
automobile dealer who now has nine granchildren. ``I got my name on
the Okefenokee swamp boat. Next I'm going for a battleship.''

   Florists, nurseries and even supermarkets in South
Florida are selling the same leaves that folks up north are raking
up and trying to get rid of.
   ``It brings back that northern atmosphere,'' said Pam Halliday,
a manager at Frank's Nursery in Tamarac, where a bag of six to
eight leaves costs $3.99 to $4.99.
   ``People come in bunches to buy them. We're sold out.''
   ``When I was a kid I used to hate them because I had to rake
them all the time,'' said Ohio native John Tsugranes, whose two
Palm Beach County floral shops sell bags of leaves ranging in price
from $1 to $12. ``But after 18 years here without fall, I sort of
miss them.''
   Most of the leaves are brought in from the Carolinas, though
some come from as far away as Oregon and Canada. Florists, who
douse them with preservatives to maintain their color, say oak and
maple leaves are best.
   At Publix supermarkets, the leaves go for 99 cents a branch.
``They're very popular,'' said spokesman Bill Schroter. ``I'm at a
loss to explain why.''

<HEAD>Unpublished Stevenson Story to Appear in Georgia Review</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An unpublished and nearly forgotten story by
Robert Louis Stevenson will appear in the fall issue of the Georgia
Review, the University of Georgia's literary magazine.
   The story, ``The Enchantress,'' was handwritten in pencil by
Stevenson, probably in 1889 on a ship en route from Hawaii to
Samoa, according to an announcement Thursday from the university.
The ailing author, who wrote ``Treasure Island'' and other
classics, spent the last five years of his life on Samoa.
   The 27-page manuscript was held by private collectors until it
was acquired recently by Yale University, the announcement said.
Yale had not yet cataloged the story.
   David Mann, a professor at Miami University of Ohio, found it at
Yale while doing research on another project and recognized it.
Scholars had known of its existence and believe it is the last of
Stevenson's unaccounted-for completed manuscripts.
   In an introduction in the Georgia Review, Mann speculates that
Stevenson's heirs declined to publish the story because it was too
biographical. One of its characters closely resembled Stevenson's
wife, who had divorced someone else to marry the author.
   The story apparently was written as part of an agreement that
each passenger on the cruise would write a story to be read to the
others, Mann said.
   ``We're delighted that Professor Mann and Yale chose to offer
the story to us first,'' said Stanley Lindberg, editor of the
Georgia Review and a professor of English at the University of
Georgia.
   ``It has value both as a story worth reading today and as a
piece of literary history.''

<HEAD>Fourth Body Found in Search of Farm</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A fourth body has been found after 2{
weeks of digging and searching near the farm of an elderly couple
charged with conspiracy to steal cattle.
   The body of an unidentified man was found Wednesday evening in a
shallow grave in a barn about three miles northeast of Ludlow, in
northwestern Missouri. Three unidentified men were found 10 days
earlier buried at a farm several miles away.
   The digging started Oct. 9 after Ray Copeland, 75, and his wife,
Faye Copeland, 68, were arrested in the alleged cattle swindle.
   No charges have been filed in the four deaths. Authorities have
not named the Copelands as murder suspects but have said they are
searching for a number of transients who may have stayed with the
Copelands.
   Joe Ray Adams, 62, owner of the 860-acre farm where the body was
found Wednesday, said Copeland had worked for the previous owner as
the farm manager. Adams said the body, clad in boots and a heavy
coat, was wrapped in plastic and buried in a shallow grave under
bales of hay in a metal barn. He said the body was found under
small square bales of hay that had been stacked in the barn while
Copeland still worked at the farm and some large round bales that
Adams had added since he purchased the farm.
   An examination Wednesday night in Chillicothe did not determine
a cause of death, and the remains were being sent to Columbia for
further study, said Greg Coon, spokesman for the North Central
Missouri Major Case Squad.
   The decomposed bodies of three men were found Oct. 16 in shallow
graves in a barn on a farm near Ludlow where Copeland had done odd
jobs. Authorities said the men, between the ages of 20 and 32, had
been shot in the head.
   Earlier digging and searches by bloodhounds and officers
uncovered no bodies on the Copelands' 40-acre farm about 12 miles
north of where the three bodies were found, or about 90 miles
northeast of Kansas City.
   The Copelands were jailed on $25,000 bond each on charges that
they bought cattle with a check that bounced, then failed to make
good on the check.

<TEXT>
   A U.S. magistrate today ordered that a man who
slugged Sen. John Glenn be held without bond and sent to a federal
prison hospital for psychiatric evaluation.
   Michael Breen, 31, of Washington, identified by prosecutors as
an engineer with Martin Marietta Corp., is to undergo testing for
30 days at a federal prison hospital in Butner, N.C., Magistrate
Deborah Robinson ordered.
   He appeared before Ms. Robinson on a felony charge of assaulting
a member of Congress a day after he slugged Glenn on the jaw as the
Ohio Democrat was being interviewed by a television reporter in
front of the National Air and Space Museum.
   The charge carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a
$10,000 fine.
   Breen was muttering about earthquakes and the Pope, said Gary
Nurenberg, who was interviewing Glenn when the incident occurred.
   Breen's attorney, Barry Stiller, declined to discuss the case
but told reporters his client is ``just a very nice young man who I
think is a little confused.''
   Glenn, a former Marine officer, rubbed his jaw and said ``I
haven't been hit like that in 30 years,'' said Nurenberg.
   Glenn's jaw was red and sore but he did not see a doctor and
kept to his schedule, aides said.
   U.S. Capitol Police and the Secret Service identified Breen as
the man detained for about two hours Tuesday after he broke through
a police line outside the Capitol and tried to approach Quayle's
motorcade.
   ``He was just trying to pass a letter,'' U.S. Capitol Police
Officer Dan Nichols said. Breen was stopped before he got to the
cars and was not arrested, Nichols and Secret Service spokeswoman
Jane Vezeris said.
   Glenn was knocked a bit off balance by the sideways, closed-fist
slug but quickly immobilized his assailant by grabbing his arms,
witnesses said.
   ``This guy starts muttering, `The earthquakes are starting, the
earthquakes are starting,' comes up and socks Glenn on the jaw,''
said Rebecca Bell, Glenn's press secretary.
   ``The senator, with both hands on the man's arms, pushed him
toward the security guard,'' said Nurenberg, a correspondent with
Gillett News Bureau. ``The senator at 68 had bette reflexes than
anybody else there.''
   Before District of Columbia police took Breen into custody,
Nurenberg said Breen said he believed the California earthquake was
a harbinger of imminent catastrophe in which two-thirds of the
world's population would be wiped out.
   ``He talked about the children of Fatima. He said the Pope is
withholding information,'' the correspondent said.
   Nurenberg described the man as well-dressed, wearing a coat, tie
and suspenders. ``He looked to be a professional, yuppie type,'' he
said.
   The assailant told Nurenberg he slugged Glenn ``to get
attention,'' the correspondent said.

<HEAD>Kabul Mayor Criticizes Soviet Intervention</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet military intervention in
Afghanistan was immoral, unnecessary and partly to blame for the
country's current plight, a top government official said Thursday.
   The remarks of Karim Masiq, the mayor of Kabul and member of the
Central Committee of the ruling People's Democratic Party, were the
first time a government official has openly criticized Moscow's
decision to send troops to Afghanistan.
   Masiq, in a wide-ranging interview with Western reporters, also
said his party, which for years has adhered to Marxist economic
policies, now wants the private sector to expand and help save
Afghanistan's people from starvation.
   Even private merchants selling stolen goods will not be
prosecuted, he said, ``because they are still involved in bringing
necessary goods to the market.''
   Masiq, a former political prisoner and short-story writer, was
appointed Wednesday to the Central Committee as the ruling party
held its first plenum since Soviet troops withdrew in February.
Unlike last year's meeting, when security forces rounded up
hundreds of members of opposing political factions, this year's
plenum exuded an atmosphere of intra-party unity, diplomats said.
   On Monday, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said
Moscow's invasion of Afghanistan was illegal and violated ``cvil
norms and ethics.'' Masiq agreed with that and called the incursion
immoral.
   ``It is very clear that it was unnecessary,'' Masiq said. ``And
it is only natural that the Afghanistan people would defend against
the Soviet force.''
   Significantly, Masiq did not criticize the United States or
other countries for aiding the Moslem guerrillas, known as the
mujahedeen, or ``holy warriors,'' during the Soviet involvement.
But he said they were wrong to continue supporting the rebels after
the Soviets left Afghanistan.
   ``There are no mujahedeen now,'' Masiq said. ``We are the
mujahedeen.''
   He said that although many factors have hurt Afghanistan, the
Soviet military presence had added to the problems in this poor
country.
   Although Masiq is the first government official to openly
criticize the Soviet incursion, other public figures have done so
recently. Tuesday night, a leading religious figure told state-run
TV he thought the intervention was wrong. A group of former
officials who served under the deposed King Zahir Shah have made
similar statements.
   The campaign appears to be part of President Najib's attempts to
broaden the base of his government among a people who strongly
opposed the Soviet military presence and have little love for
Moscow.
   Masiq is a member of the Khalq, or masses, faction of the ruling
party. In 1979, he was on the Central Committee and the
policy-making Politburo when the Soviet troops entered Afghanistan.
   Khalq forces, who came to power in 1978 in a military-backed
communist coup, opposed the Soviet incursion. Many faction members,
including Masiq, were jailed.
   Since the Soviet withdrawal, the government of Najib, who leads
the Parcham, or flag, faction, has rehabilitated leading Khalq
members in an attempt to heal the party rift and improve relations
with the military.
   Khalq has traditionally held sway among the armed forces while
Parcham is strong among intellectuals.
   Masiq was recently released from house arrest and appoined mayor
of Kabul. His appointment to the Central Committee was another move
at at peace-making.
   In the interview, Masiq said the government would welcome all
former rebels and help them get settled. He said even mercenaries
who became rich by selling weapons and using the money to buy land
would be helped.
   ``The state supports all these poeple because they are tired of
war,'' he said. ``It is better than rockets.''

<HEAD>`Pooh Pooh Choo Choo' Headed Back To Baltimore, Officials Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAPOLEONVILLE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Local officials raised a stink about
it, so a waste disposal company decided against accepting a train
loaded with smelly sewage sludge from Baltimore and sent it back.
   ``They took the `pooh pooh choo-choo' where it belongs. They
took it out of this parish,'' said Jim Simmons, president of the
Police Jury, the governing body of Assumption Parish.
   GSX Land Treatment Inc. had subcontracted with an engineering
firm to take the nonhazardous sewer sludge from a failed Baltimore
composting firm that bought the 12,000 tons of sludge from the city
of Baltimore. That city is under a state order to dispose of
200,000 tons of sludge by the end of November.
   GSX had intended to dispose of the sludge at its ``land farm''
in nearby White Castle, La. _ essentially a landfill where
non-hazardous waste is plowed into the ground. Some cities process
sewer sludge and sell it as fertilizer or soil conditioner.
   But residents of Assumption Parish complained vehemently about
the stench of the train, which also had passed through
Donaldsonville in Ascension Parish.
   The company moved its unloading operation to a less populated
site near Labadieville after Donaldsonville city attorney Sidney
Marchand filed a motion in court to stop the operation.
   After District Attorney Donald Carmouche threatened to do the
same thing on behalf of the Assumption Parish Police Jury, GSX
agreed to keep its unloading operation out of the area.
   Although GSX did accept 27 cars full of the sludge, it sent 63
others cars back and agreed it wouldn't take an additional 110 cars
not yet shipped to Louisiana.
   Carmouche said the waste train pulled out of the area Wednesday
and was headed back to Maryland, although there was no confirmation
of its destination from Baltimore officials or GSX.
   ``For the first time, Baltimore waste is going where it belongs
_ Baltimore,'' Carmouche told the Police Jury.
   Disposing of sewer waste isn't illegal in Louisiana, but
officials said they objected to taking out-of-state waste _
especially out-of-state waste that smelled so bad.
   GSX facility manager Dan Martin said the company was spending
more than anticipated trying to keep the sludge from smelling.
   Joseph Harrison, manager and vice president of Supreme Sugar in
Assumption Parish, said he's glad the controversy is over and that
the smells from the waste train aren't mixing with the strong odors
from his company's refinery.
   ``Pooh pooh and sugar don't go together,'' he told the Police
Jury.
   Earlier this month, five smelly railroad cars full of rotting
household trash were sent back to Philadelphia after Indiana
officials won a court order blocking a plan to dump the garbage in
their state. That garbage was headed for a landfill near Brazil,
Ind., but the state said the four companies involved in carting the
trash lacked a permit allowing it to be transferred from railroad
cars to dump trucks.
   That wasn't Philadelphia's first problem with long-distance
disposal. A freighter sailed the seas for two years searching for a
place to dump 14,000 tons of ash from city incinerators. The load
was rejected by 11 countries before the ship turned up empty in
Singapore late in 1988, after changing names and owners.
   Before that, a barge loaded with trash from New York's Long
Island was rejected by states down the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and
Central American nations before it was sent back.

   Deaths from colon and rectal cancer, diseases
that kill about 55,000 Americans a year, are highest along an
unexplained line from Maine to Iowa, U.S. cancer specialists said
Thursday.
   The national Centers for Disease Control reported that the
highest mortality rates from colorectal cancer occurred in the
Northeast and the eastern north-central states _ from Maine, with a
death rate of 25.8 per 100,000 people in 1986; south to Maryland,
with 27.2; across to Iowa, with 24.8; and in virtually every state
in between.
   The District of Columbia had the nation's highest mortality rate
at 32.1.
   Nationwide, the mortality rate from colorectal cancer has been
declining and is now 23.1 per 100,000; 55,811 Americans died of the
disease in 1986, the CDC said.
   In the Northeast, only Connecticut at 24.5, Delaware at 23.8,
and Vermont at 22.4 had colorectal cancer death rates below 25 per
100,000. Other high rates were New Hampshire, 26.1; Massachusetts,
26.3; New York, 27.3; New Jersey, 27.1; Rhode Island, 28.7;
Pennsylvania, 26.6; Ohio, 26.4; Indiana, 25.9; and Illinois, 25.6.
   No other state exceeded a rate of 24.
   Wyoming had the lowest rate at 16.2, the Atlanta-based CDC
reported.
   The pattern _ more cancer deaths in the Northeast, fewer in the
West _ resembles one researchers have already seen in heart
disease, but they don't know why, said Dr. Robert A. Hahn, a CDC
cancer researcher.
   ``We don't know enough about the risk factors or their
distribution to say why that region is one with the highest
rates,'' Hahn said. ``We doubt it's just a matter of physical
environment, but we just don't know.''
   While few risk factors for colorectal cancer ``have been firmly
established,'' evidence points to high-fat diets as risky and
suggests that fruits and vegetables may help protect against the
disease, the CDC said.
   Obesity and a high-calorie lifestyle also may increase the risk,
while exercise may lower it, the CDC added.
   Approximately 145,000 colorectal cancer cases are diagnosed in
the United States each year, Hahn estimated.
   Colorectal cancer accounted for 12 percent of all cancer deaths
in the United States in 1986. Incidence of the disease has risen in
recent years, from a rate of 49.3 cases per 100,000 Americans in
1979 to 50.5 in 1986, Hahn said.
   But the mortality rate has dropped, from 24.8 deaths per 100,000
in 1979 to 23.1 in 1986.
   ``Detection of disease at an earlier stage might account for
some of the increase in survival,'' the CDC said. ``Stool blood
screening ..., (a) non-invasive and relatively inexpensive
technique, appears to detect a higher proportion of colorectal
cancers at earlier stages.''
   The CDC also noted that ``colorectal cancer is primarily a
cancer of the older population.'' The median age of diagnosis from
1982-86 was 71 years for cancer of the colon and 69 for rectal
cancer.
   Only three in 100,000 30-to-34-year-olds developed colorectal
cancer, compared to 532 in 100,000 in the 85-and-older category.
   The case rate in 1986 was 61 per 100,000 for men, compared with
43 per 100,000 for women.

<HEAD>Mitchell Says Capital Gains Move Will Delay Aid to Poland</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Republicans' new move to cut the capital
gains tax could delay or even kill Congress' unrelated effort to
provide aid to Poland and Hungary, Senate Democratic Leader George
Mitchell said Thursday.
   Republicans, meanwhile, said they were determined to force the
capital gains issue to an up-or-down vote to redeem one of
President Bush's principal campaign promises.
   The White House showed little enthusiasm for the GOP move,
merely expressing a willingness ``to go along.''
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, accusing Democrats
of ``pure politics'' and ``crying wolf,'' said the GOP might also
use the capital-gains issue as a bargaining chip in negotiations to
reduce the cost of the $989 million Democratic aid package for
Eastern Europe. The Republicans want a $585 million total.
   Sen. Robert Packwood, R-Ore, introduced the tax-cut proposal _
fiercely opposed by the Senate's Democratic leadership _ as an
amendment to the aid bill. The move late Wednesday halted all
action on the measure.
   Packwood said on Thursday that a majority of senators, including
several Democrats, favor a cut. But he acknowledged he does not
have the 60 votes needed to shut off a filibuster.
   Mitchell, D-Maine, told the Senate, ``Obviously the capital
gains issue has nothing to do with aid to Eastern Europe. Obviously
the only effect can be to delay and perhaps kill aid to Poland and
Hungary.''
   Mitchell, who later said the delay in passage of the
authorization bill could stall action for a week, called the GOP's
move ``unwise and almost baffling.''
   The leaders of Poland's non-communist government ``have stressed
the importance of prompt action as much as the nature and level of
the assistance itself,'' the majority leader said.
   Noting that winter is approaching, and that inflation is
skyrocketing, Mitchell said: ``This is one of those cases where
assistance provided too late will be of no assistance at all.''
   ``The administration has made clear that it believes the capital
gains reduction is more important than aid to Poland and Hungary,''
Mitchell said.
   But Dole, noting that food aid already is on the way to Poland,
said delaying the bill will have no negative impact, especially
since it is an authorization and does not actually appropriate any
money for the two countries.
   ``All of this wringing of hands is pure politics,'' Dole said.
``It's the old Democratic game of crying wolf.''
   Although Dole insisted he would force the matter to a
conclusion, the White House appeared only mildly enthusiastic.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the
administration was ``generally supportive'' of the Packwood-Dole
strategy and was ``willing to go along with it.''
   Fitzwater said the decision to link capital gains with aid to
Poland and Hungary was made on Capitol Hill, and that the
administration did not have much advance warning. Stressing that
the administration does want a vote on a capital gains tax cut,
Fitzwater said, ``We're certainly willing to see what happens.''

   Cable TV mogul Ted Turner proclaimed himself
``news king'' Thursday, declared the Ten Commandments obsolete and
said he'd pay cold, hard cash for a happy way to end the world.
   Turner _ chairman of the Turner Broadcasting System, which
includes WTBS, creator of Cable News Network and owner of two
Atlanta sports teams _ told members of the National Newspaper
Association that the biblical Ten Commandments do not relate to
current global problems, such as overpopulation and the arms race.
   ``We're living with outmoded rules,'' Turner said. ``The rules
we're living under is the Ten Commandments, and I bet nobody here
even pays much attention to 'em, because they are too old.
   ``When Moses went up on the mountain, there were no nuclear
weapons, there was no poverty. Today, the commandments wouldn't go
over. Nobody around likes to be commanded. Commandments are out.''
   So Turner listed 10 rules of his own.
   He called them ``the Ten Voluntary Initiatives'' and said they
would have people vowing, among other things, to help the
downtrodden, ``love and respect Planet Earth'' and limit their
families to two children.
   ``We are in deep, deep trouble as a species on this planet,'' he
said. ``The tremendous challenge is: are we going to survive? Or
are we going to collapse?''
   Turner also said he wants somebody to come up with a positive
way for the world to end and has been thinking about holding a
contest someday that would pay $500,000 to whoever writes the best
ending.
   ``What we've been taught in church and in school is that the
world is going to end in disaster anyway,'' he said. ``The world's
gonna be destroyed by fire; not everybody in the world believes
that.''
   Turner, who started TBS with a family-owned outdoor advertising
company and a local independent television station, told the
newspaper group that he ventured into broadcasting almost on a lark.
   ``I did all this mainly as an adventure, just for the pure old
hell of it,'' Turner said. ``That's the main reason I did it. And I
was amazed when it worked, if you want to know the truth.
   ``I said I'm going to get this news thing down. Someday I'm
going to be the news king. Then CNN came along and now I am the
news king.''

   Former HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce informed a
House subcommittee today he will again refuse to answer its
questions about mismanagement and political favoritism at the
department he led for eight years.
   Because he plans to invoke his constitutional right against
self-incrimination, Pierce, through his attorneys, asked the panel
to cancel a hearing Friday and another session next week at which
he has been subpoenaed to testify.
   Pierce, who headed the Department of Housing and Urban
Development throughout the Reagan administration, said that forcing
him to appear would subject him to unnecessary adverse publicity
and be ``punitive.''
   It was not immediately clear whether the subcommittee would
grant the request, but a congressional aide said there were no
plans to cancel Friday's hearing.
   Pierce's attorneys, in a letter to the House Government Affairs
subcommittee on employment and housing:
   ``Upon the advice of counsel, Mr. Pierce will again invoke his
rights under the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution. Mr. Pierce is
concerned that there continues to be an atmosphere wherein he
remains a target of the subcommittee hearings.''
   The attorneys, Paul L. Perito and Robert Plotkin, asked the
subpoenas be vacated.
   The stalemate between Pierce and the subcommittee has brought
the investigation to a crossroads. The former secretary and three
of his deputies have refused to cooperate with the panel and some
members say it should move past the investigative phase and work on
reform initiatives.
   But its chairman, Rep. Thomas Lantos, D-Calif., has raised the
possibility of granting immunity to two former Pierce deputies who
also have refused to testify in hopes their accounts would shed
light on Pierce's role in fraud, mismanagement and
influence-peddling at HUD.
   After Pierce refused to testify last month, several subcommittee
members questioned whether he had waived his constitutional
protections when he appeared before the panel voluntarily in May.
   Pierce's attorneys disputed such interpretations of the law and
House rules and Lantos said he would rule on the question. He
informed Pierce's attorneys of his finding today, but they declined
to discuss it.
   A congressional source, however, indicated that Lantos had
concluded he could compel Pierce to testify but was inclined not to
do so.
   Pierce's latest move comes as his attorneys stepped up their
effort to defend him by challenging the sworn account of a former
HUD official, Shirley Wiseman, who said Pierce personally ordered
her to fund a North Carolina project over the objections of several
department officials.
   Prior to her testimony Pierce, in his initial appearance before
the subcommittee, said he took no direct role in funding decisions.
Lawmakers who have accused the former secretary of misleading them
and possibly commiting perjury often refer to Wiseman's account.
   In 1985, when HUD's inspector general questioned Wiseman about
the project, she said Pierce's top aide spoke to her about
approving it but never mentioned a conversation with Pierce,
according to the notes of the investigator who interviewed her and
a memo he prepared for Pierce's lawyers.
   Perito said Pierce acknowledges supporting the development, the
conversion of a hosiery mill into housing, but cannot recall the
conversation she told Congress took place.
   ``If she didn't mention the call from the secretary months after
the project was funded, it seems strange that she can remember it
so clearly years later,'' Perito said. He said the subcommittee
staff had access to the same documents before it questioned Wiseman
but never asked her about the seeming inconsistency.
   Although Congress may never get to question Pierce again about
his role at HUD, it appears likely he will issue a written rebuttal
of allegations raised in congressional hearings and media accounts
of fraud, mismanagement and influence peddling during his
eight-year tenure.
   ``My client certainly has a story to tell and wants to tell his
story but needs to decide the how and when and where of doing so,''
said Perito.

   Major environmental groups accused the Bush
administration Thursday of having ``no plans, no action and no one
in charge'' to deal with global warming, which many scientists say
could cause severe problems by the middle of the next century.
   The criticism came amid reports that top advisers to President
Bush were divided on how aggressively the United States should push
for specific commitments on reducing so-called ``greenhouse''
pollutants.
   Eleven environmental groups at a news confernce accused the
president of reneging on a campaign promise to tackle the global
warming issue early in his presidency. Bush said during the
campaign that he would host an international conference on global
warming and other environmental issues during his first year in
office.
   ``The other industrial countries are looking at the United
States for leadership ... (but) we have silence from the president
and total disarray within the administration,'' said Brooks Yeager,
governmental affairs director for the Audubon Society.
   ``We have great rhetoric but no leadership,'' declared Dan
Becker of the Sierra Club. ``There are no plans, no action, no one
in charge.''
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said ``we feel
progress has been made'' in confronting concerns about expected
rising world temperatures because of the enormous man-made
pollutants allowed into the air.
   But Fitzwater said pollution curbs should not be proposed
unilaterally and the administration must consider the long-term
economic impacts of any actions aimed at dealing with global
warming.
   ``There are economic aspects of this that cannot be ignored just
blindly in the search for global warming,'' said Fitzwater.
   The latest round of criticism was prompted by reports of
disagreement within the administration on whether to send a
delegation to an upcoming conference of environmental ministers in
the Netherlands.
   William K. Reilly, administrator of the Environmental Protection
Agency, said on Wednesday that he would head a delegation to the
conference Nov. 6-7, but that the United States was not prepared to
endorse a proposed commitment for a freeze by the year 2000 on
greenhouse gases at current levels.
   The Dutch government has said it plans to propose such a freeze
at the conference and environmentalists have argued even a freeze
is inadequte, calling for at least a 20 percent reduction by the
end of the century.
   Administration sources, speaking on the condition they not be
named, acknowleged that until recent days it was not even certain
that Reilly would attend the conference.
   Reilly declined to discuss reports of discord within the
administration on the global warming issue. ``The president has
made it very clear. We recognize the global warming problem,'' he
said, but he added ``a whole range of questions'' remain to be
resolved.
   Environmentalists said uncertainty within the administration has
sent a signal to European leaders that the Bush administration is
not prepared to lead the effort to curb global warming pollutants,
although the United States accounts for one-fifth of the world's
greenhouse gases.
   ``This is a major meeting,'' said Christopher Flavin, a global
warming expert at the Worldwatch Institute. ``It's been in the
planning stage for the better part of a year. The United States
just doesn't have its act together.''
   The environmental groups called for the United States to endorse
a 20 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by the year
2000. Such cuts would require sharp increases in automobile fuel
efficiency and other energy conservation measures. Many scientists
say unless these pollutants are curbed the world will see
significant increases in world temperatures by the middle of the
next century.
   Other major environmental groups critical of the Bush
administration included the Natural Resources Defense Council,
Friends of the Earth and the Environmental Defense Fund.

<TEXT>
   Israeli manufacturers have filed a police
complaint against an Arab pasta-maker whose packages of spaghetti
are red, white, green and black _ the colors of the outlawed
Palestinian flag.
   A spokesman for the Israeli Manufacturers' Association said
Thursday the group has asked police to investigate the Al Ghazel
Macaroni Co. in the occupied West Bank city of Bethlehem.
   ``We asked police to investigate why they are allowed to
distribute the flag in this way. It should be considered against
the law,'' said Danny Leish, the spokesman for the group, Israel's
largest industrial association.
   The Palestinian flag is illegal in Israel and the occupied
territories. Israel considers it the flag of the Palestine
Liberation Organization, which the government defines as a
terrorist organization.
   The spaghetti dispute is the latest in a long string of battles
over the flag during the 22-month-old Palestinian uprising. It also
reflects Israeli anger over at economic slump, blamed partly on the
revolt, which has sent unemployment to a record 9.5 percent.
   Wadi Abu Eta, the owner of Al Ghazel, could not be reached for
comment. His factory is on the edge of Beit Sahour, a village that
the army has declared a closed area since it has boycotted Israeli
taxes during the uprising. Telephone lines to the area also are cut.
   Ruth Shlesinger, a spokeswoman for national police in Jerusalem,
declined comment on the complaint, filed two weeks ago.
   Leish denied the complaint was aimed at harming an Arab
competitor, but acknowledged Israeli food manufacturers were among
the hardest hit by Israel's recession.
   Israeli food companies have lost $100 million in the last 22
months and had to cut about 1,000 jobs, Leish said.
   He blamed much of the damage on a boycott of Israeli products by
the 1.7 million Arabs of the West Bank and Gaza Strip as part of
the uprising against occupation.
   The problem is compounded, Leish said, by Arab competitors who
market products within Israel in package that have Hebrew but not
Arabic letters.
   He noted Al Ghazel's spaghetti has only Hebrew letters on its
package with red, white, green and black strips and added the
manufacturers' group has asked the army to insist Arab products be
clearly identified.
   Palestinian manufacturers also have complained that Israeli
products sold in the occupied lands often are not tagged with their
place of origin.
   Packaging and lettering are only some of the symbols that are
fought over in the Palestinian uprising. Soldiers and police
regularly force Arab youths to pull down Palestinian flags and
sometimes order them to remove shirts in the flag's colors.
   Earlier this week, the Hadashot daily reported, an Israeli
hospital refused to register a Bedouin Arab baby girl given the
popular uprising name ``Tahrir,'' Arabic for ``liberation.''
   Israeli reports on Al Ghazal spaghetti noted the package also
bears a Kosher stamp showing it conforms with Jewish dietary laws.

   The Bush administration notified the Soviet
Union on Thursday that it is willing to discuss an offer by Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze to curtail military bases in Europe.
   ``We support that aim and are willing to work with them to
preserve their security through political rather than military
means,'' the State Department said.
   The administration gave a quick brushoff, however, to another
Soviet arms control initiative _ an offer by President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev to make the Baltics a nuclear free zone coupled with an
announcement he would withdraw four nuclear submarines from the
area.
   ``It seems rather curious to me,'' Assistant Secretary of State
Raymond Seitz said. ``I am not aware there are nuclear weapons in
the Baltic republics, although there may be.''
   Secondly, Seitz told reporters at a Washington journalism
seminar, ``he is making a declaration about moving nuclear weapons
from what he regards as national territory. So in terms of the
internationalism of it, it doesn't make much sense to me.''
   Seitz, who runs the European Affairs bureau, added: ``At first
blush I would find it troubling because it seems to be kind of
sleight-of-hand.''
   The White House also dismissed the initiative. But the State
Department warmed to Shevardnadze's proposal on European bases,
which also got short shrift from the White House earlier in the
week.
   A statement issued by the department's press office said similar
Soviet proposals in the past appeared to be aimed at the
elimination of U.S. bases on foreign soil. ``We cannot accept such
an outcome,'' the statement said. ``We maintain bases as part of a
successful system of collective defense which has assured our
security and that of our friends and allies.''
   However, the State Department said, the proposal Tuesday by
Shevardnadze in a Moscow speech could mean the Soviets now are
searching for ways to disengage from some of their foreign military
commitments, particularly in Europe.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said in Europe, meanwhile, that
``we're always looking at base structure, especially in a time of
tight budgets.'' And he noted that U.S. operations at Torrejon in
Spain were based phased out. At the request of the Spanish
government the F-15 jet fighters stationed there are being moved to
Italy.
   Gorbachev, in a speech in Helsinki, Finland, said the Soviet
Union had removed all tactical nuclear missiles that could strike
the Baltic region and would take certain types of sea-launched
nuclear weapons out of the Baltic Sea.
   The Soviet leader said the eventual goal was to rid the Baltic
of nuclear weapons.
   ``We are prepared to come to agreement with all the nuclear
powers and the Baltic states on effective guarantees for the
nuclear-free status of the Baltic Sea,'' he said.
   Gorbachev said the steps were being taken unilaterally and were
a follow-up to a speech he gave two years ago in the Soviet
northern port of Murmansk. Many of his proposals in that speech _
including a call for a nuclear-free zone in northern Europe _ were
dismissed by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   Initially, Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said,
``We do not believe nuclear-free zones contribute to security in
Europe. Most of these proposals have been designed to affect NATO
deterrence capability while leaving Soviet nuclear weapons intact.
On the other hand, we do appreciate the intent of this and if it
can develop into something concrete, why, that might be a hopeful
sign.''
   A few hours later, Fitzwater returned with a colder assessment.
   A ``notice to the press'' said: ``The United States remains
opposed to the concept of nuclear weapons free zones in Europe, or
in waters surrounding Europe, because we think such zones do not
make a real contribution to preserving European security and
stability.''
   Also, a Bush administration official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, called the proposal ``another step in marching toward
their goal of getting nuclear weapons out of Europe _ primarily
ours.''

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
said Thursday that Moscow will cut its nuclear forces in the Baltic
Sea and will destroy four aging submarines and the nuclear missiles
they carry.
   Gorbachev also said the Soviet Union has removed all tactical
nuclear missiles that could strike the northern European region and
will take certain types of sea-launched nuclear weapons out of the
Baltic Sea.
   In a 45-minute speech to Finnish business leaders, politicians
and other guests on the second day of a three-day visit to Finland,
Gorbachev repeated his hope to eliminate nuclear weapons from the
148,600-square-mile Baltic Sea.
   ``We are prepared to come to agreement with all the nuclear
powers and the Baltic states on effective guarantees for the
nuclear-free status of the Baltic Sea,'' he said in a nationally
broadcast speech in Helsinki's Finlandia Hall.
   Gorbachev said the Soviet Union was taking the steps
unilaterally, dropping previous conditions that Western countries
first agree to a nuclear-free zone.
   In Washington, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater
said, ``We do not believe nuclear-free zones contribute to security
in Europe.
   ``Most of these proposals have been designed to affect NATO
deterrence capability while leaving Soviet nuclear weapons
intact,'' Fitzwater said. ``On the other hand, we do appreciate the
intent of this and if it can develop into something concrete, why,
that might be a hopeful sign.''
   Later, Fitzwater revised his remarks, saying, ``In fact we do
not consider this a hopeful sign.''
   Gorbachev said the steps were a follow-up to a speech he gave
two years ago in the Soviet Union's northern port of Murmansk, in
which he first proposed a nuclear-free zone in northern Europe. Two
NATO countries in the region, Norway and Denmark, do not permit
nuclear weapons in their territory in peacetime.
   Gorbachev said the Soviet Union already has taken two of its six
Golf-class submarines out of operation from the Baltic Sea and
pledged to destroy the remaining four by the end of next year.
   In his Murmansk speech, Gorbachev had offered to remove
nuclear-armed subs from the Baltic Sea and Soviet officials offered
to withdraw the remaining four only if countries of the region
agreed ``on a non-nuclear North.''
   On Thursday, he dropped that requirement.
   ``The Soviet Union started by removing from operational status
two Golf-class submarines and before the end of 1990 it will
destroy the four remaining submarines of the same class. We will
also destroy their standard nuclear missile payloads and we have no
plans for their replacement,'' he said.
   Six Golf II subs, 321 feet long with a displacement of 2,950
tons, have been deployed in the Baltic Sea since 1976, according to
the British reference book Jane's Fighting Ships. The Soviets have
said the subs carried 18 ballistic missiles.
   The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute has
described the Golf II as obsolete and predicted they would be
removed from service because they are of limited value.
   Gorbachev did not specify which types of sea-launched nuclear
weapons the Soviets would remove from the sea.
   The United States has expressed concern that removal of the
sea-launched missiles cannot be verified, and it has balked at
their inclusion in a superpower arms pact being negotiated in
Geneva.
   Finnish officials welcomed Gorbachev's announcements, and they
also are likely to please grassroots political groups in the Baltic
republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania that have urged the
Kremlin to remove nuclear weapons from the region.
   In another announcement, Gorbachev said the Kremlin has agreed
to Norway's proposal to negotiate mutual notification of accidents
involving ships, including nuclear-powered submarines.
   Three Soviet nuclear-powered submarines have been involved in
accidents since April in the Barents and Norwegian seas.
   In other comments, Gorbachev:
   _ Reversed decades of ``Finlandization'' _ pressure on Finland
to toe the Kremlin line _ by saying to applause, ``The Soviet Union
unreservedly recognizes Finland's neutral status.''
   _ Proposed that the next follow-up meeting to the 1975 Helsinki
Accords, which outlined East-West security measures, cooperation in
economic and scientific and human rights affairs, be held in 1992
in Helsinki and be attended by leaders of the 35 states involved.
   _ Paved the way for direct contacts between legislators in the
Soviet Baltic republics and Scandinavian countries grouped in the
Nordic Council.
   Gorbachev, seeking Finnish help in modernizing the Soviet
economy, met with industrialists and reviewed Finnish developments
in a range of industries from forestry to clothing for seamen on
icebreakers or arctic construction workers. Many of the companies
represented at the meeting already have joint projects with the
Soviets, but Gorbachev said there should be more.
   He showed special interest in pollution-monitoring equipment for
mining and metallurgy and asked how much they would add to costs.
He made clear he had in mind Soviet industries in the Kola
Peninsula bordering Finland.
   ``I've been there. I've seen it with my own eyes,'' he said of
the pollution. ``The target should be higher.''

   Home improvement guru Bob Vila, who advised
millions of viewers on the nuts and bolts of nuts and bolts on
``This Old House,'' will return to television in a nationally
syndicated show.
   The weekly half-hour program, tentatively titled ``Home Again
with Bob Vila,'' is scheduled to air next spring and will focus on
affordable do-it-yourself remodeling jobs.
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. announced Wednesday it will co-sponsor
and syndicate the show. Vila has also been signed as exclusive
spokesman for Sears home improvement products.
   Vila was host of the Emmy Award-winning ``This Old House'' on
the Public Broadcasting System from 1979 until last spring, when
his contract was not renewed.
   Daphne Noyes, publicist for ``This Old House,'' said Vila had
been doing commercials for a competitor of a major local
underwriter of the show.
   ``He had agreed to give up some of his commercial activities, if
we could indemnify him for the loss of income,'' she said. But the
producing station, WGBH-TV in Boston, chose not to do so, and
decided not to renew his contract.
   Vila's agent Rob Feiner said the bitterness Vila felt after
being forced to leave PBS has disappeared.
   ``He's looking to the future now,'' Feiner said.

   Series television and a regular schedule fit
Jamie Lee Curtis' new lifestyle perfectly.
   Curtis, who stars in ``Anything But Love'' on ABC and whose
movies include ``Trading Places'' and ``A Fish Called Wanda,''
adopted a baby girl three years ago with her husband, actor and
writer Christopher Guest.
   ``I was hoping to do a series,'' Curtis said in the Oct. 29
issue of Parade magazine. ``I wanted stability. I'm a wife and
mother now, and I want to dedicate as much time to my family as to
my work.''
   Curtis, unable to have children of her own, says, ``A woman who
can't have a child is handicapped. You're unable to do something
that you want. But that doesn't mean you have to give up.''
   She has already told her daughter Annie she is adopted.
   ``I've told her that another woman had her but was unable to
take care of her,'' she says. ``I'm taking care of her, and I'm her
mom. I think the more you tell a child she's adopted, the more
she'll feel comfortable with it.''

   Singer Stevie Nicks says she's glad to be back in
her native Phoenix after her ``skateboard'' ride on the San
Francisco earthquake.
   Nicks said she was underground in an amphitheater in Concord,
Calif., about 20 miles northeast of San Francisco, preparing for a
show when the quake hit Oct 17.
   ``The ground actually started to move back and forth under my
feet like a skateboard. A few minutes later, our tour manager came
in and yelled, `Everybody out!,''' Nicks recalled. ``He grabbed me
and we and about 30 people went running up two flights of stairs.''
   Nicks said the concert, part of her first solo tour in three
years, was cancelled for fear of aftershocks.
   ``It got me pretty shook up. It makes you stop and take stock of
your life,'' said the 41-year-old Nicks.
   ``That's why I couldn't wait to get back to Phoenix. I need to
be home, to be in my beautiful desert.''

   The wife of New York Giants linebacker
Lawrence Taylor has filed for divorce after eight years of
marriage, her attorney said Thursday.
   ``She is seeking a divorce on the basis of cruelty which began
in 1983 and has been continuing recently,'' Michael K. Diamond said.
   In the divorce complaint, Deborah Belinda Taylor said Taylor
once appeared at a family function with another woman, and was
drunk and made a scene at the hospital when she was in labor with
their third child.
   The complaint said Taylor's much publicized cocaine problem,
which Taylor had claimed he kicked by playing golf, was no longer a
factor.
   ``Drugs were once a problem but that is a thing of the past,''
said Diamond.
   Steve Rosner, Taylor's business manager, said, ``It's a personal
matter, and as far as Lawrence and I are concerned, it will stay a
personal matter.''

<TEXT>
   The Roman Catholic Church entered the
world of Polish prime-time television Thursday with the first
broadcast of a regular weekly religious show, believed to be the
first such program in Eastern Europe.
   The church, which claims more than 90 percent of Poles as
believers, has long sought access to television.
   But while coverage of such major religious events as papal
visits to Poland and Polish-born Pope John Paul II's Christmas Mass
had been permitted in recent years, the former Communist rulers
long balked at allowing regular religious programming.
   Finally, in connection with a new law establishing the legal
basis for the church's activities in Poland, an agreement allowing
the church television and radio programs was concluded in June with
the previous communist government.
   The Rev. Andrzej Koprowski, the host of the new show, said
before the broadcast that it answers the needs of the
overwhelmingly Catholic society which had listed a demand for
broadcast Masses in the labor upheaval that gave rise to Solidarity
in August 1980.
   Koprowski said the church wants ``to present the forms of its
presence in the world of culture, in social problems and on a world
scale.''
   On the show itself Koprowski, dressed in his black cassock,
welcomed Cardinal Jozef Glemp, the highest Roman Catholic authority
in Poland, who in turn blessed the program. The segment had been
recorded earlier in the day.
   ``I welcome television with great joy and hope, a television
which will broadcast programs of faith, programs of the church and
of believers,'' said Glemp, who wore a large silver cross around
his neck.
   ``I attach great hopes to this service. ... Today, technology,
especially in the mass media, helps us a lot and we would like to
be able to pass on a richness of spirit.''
   The program is being produced by a newly formed Religious
Programs Desk within the Episcopate, the administrative arm of
Poland's bishops.
   State TV said the programs are produced on church premises and
its only responsiblity is to broadcast the shows it receives from
the Episcopate.
   The 20-minute church programs are to be appear each Thursday at
6:25 p.m. on Polish Channel 1. In addition, Channel 2 will
broadcast a 20-minute ``evening prayer'' on Tuesdays at 6:30 p.m.
   Two months ago, the church began broadcasting weekly radio
programs.
   This has been a year of major achievements for the church with
the signing in May of a bill by parliament guaranteeing the right
of the church to operate legally.
   In addition to Glemp's blessing, the new show carried an
interview with Jerzy Turowicz, editor of the influential Catholic
weekly Tygodnik Powszechny, who battled with communist authorities
for years to keep publishing the paper he founded after World War
II.
   ``Television is a very powerful means of influencing people and
public opinion. It is a very valuable thing that the church in
Poland obtained the possibility to use this means. And it's very
important to take full advantage of this big chance,'' he said.
   Turowicz said he believed the program should not focus on church
liturgy and holiday celebrations, but that it should educate
society.
   It should be about ``problems that the church is living with,
which the church must face, about difficult problems which must be
solved and should give Catholics something to think about,''
Turowicz said.

<TEXT>
   President Bush extended most-favored-nation
trade status to Hungary on Thursday, ending 15 years of U.S.
economic sanctions.
   Bush's action, at a Rose Garden ceremony, made Hungary the first
nation to be freed from trade restrictions imposed under the
so-called Jackson-Vanik amendment, which links human rights to
trade policy.
   The sanctions have been the centerpiece of U.S. trade policy
toward the communist world and remain largely in place against the
Soviet Union and most nations in Eastern Europe.
   But Bush praised Hungary, which declared itself a democracy
three days ago, for riding ``at the crest' of ``the historic tide
of freedom'' sweeping Eastern Europe.
   ``Hungary fulfilled its part of the bargain. And I'm here to
fulfill our part of the bargain,'' Bush said.
   He noted that he had promised Hungary such trade treatment
during his trip to Budapest in July if the Hungarian government
took steps to liberalize its emigration policy.
   The action gives Hungary full access to U.S. markets and the
lowest possible tariff rates, putting it on an equal footing with
major U.S. trading partners.
   The Jackson-Vanik amendment to the Trade Act of 1974 denies
trade benefits to nations that restrict emigration. It is named
after its congressional sponsors, the late Sen. Henry M. Jackson,
D-Wash., and former Rep. Charles Vanik, R-Ohio.
   Bush said that Hungary, under legislation approved by its
Parliament on Sept. 26, now meets all the free-emigration
requirements of U.S. law.
   ``Today's action ... signals the recognition that a quiet
revolution is taking place in thousands of shops and farms and
factories,'' Bush said at a ceremony signing documents exempting
Hungary from the Jackson-Vanik sanctions. ``It signals the rebirth
of Hungary as an entrepreneurial nation.''
   ``The people of America are exchanging more than blue jeans and
fine wines; we're exchanging ideas and ideals that can only be the
shared province of free people,'' he added.
   The Jackson-Vanik law requires an annual report to Congress on
the emigration policies of each nation covered under the
restriction, and an assessment of whether there has been progress
toward unrestricted emigration.
   Bush signed a report to Congress asserting that Hungary does not
``deny its citizens the right or opportunity to emigrate.''
   ``There are no known cases of government refusal to allow
emigration from Hungary, whether to join a close family member in
the United States, or for any other reason,'' the report said.
   On Capitol Hill, meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell said that U.S. aid to Poland and Hungary will be delayed
and perhaps killed by a Republican attempt to inject capital gains
tax reductions into the aid debate.
   But Republican leader Bob Dole accused Democrats of injecting
partisan politics into the debate over the size of the aid package
and said Republicans had no choice but to seek action on capital
gains on every possible bill.

   Deputies set out on horseback Thursday
to intensify the search of brown, dry fields near the spot where an
11-year-old boy was abducted by a masked man with a gun.
   Hundreds of people have volunteered to help search for Jacob
Wetterling. Some 600 people attended a prayer vigil Wednesday.
   ``This is an area of the country where tornadoes occur. We have
blizzards. People get lost in them and die. But how do you protect
yourself against ... the stranger who steps out of the dark and
snatches your child?'' said Anthony Sorem, who teaches psychology
at two private schools in the area.
   Sunday night was the first time Jacob had been allowed to ride
his bicycle after dark to go to a convenience store, when he
planned to rent a videotape, said his father, Jerry Wetterling.
Jacob was accompanied by his 10-year-old brother, Trevor, and an
11-year-old friend.
   On the way back to the Wetterlings house outside this central
Minnesota town of 2,200, they were accosted by a man who had what
appeared to be panty hose pulled over his head to distort his
facial features.
   The two boys who escaped told police the man pulled a gun and
asked them their ages, then ordered them to run away and threatened
to shoot them. Not until they were a distance down the road did
they realize Jacob wasn't with them.
   Stearns County Sheriff's Lt. Charlie Brigham said 43 special
deputies from at least five central Minnesota counties formed a
volunteer posse Thursday, hoping to find clues that searchers on
foot and all-terrain vehicles might have missed in a 15-square-mile
area around the abduction point.
   He said riding on horseback expands the searchers' field of
vision. ``It's unbelievable what you can do with these things,''
Brigham said.
   Charlie Grafft, the Stearns County sheriff, said the group was
looking for any clues, especially clothing that may have been left
behind.
   Wetterling said he and his wife Patty, 39, a substitute school
teacher, had warned their four children to be wary of strangers.
   ``My advice would be to take time to sit down and instruct
children that there are sick people in the world,'' said
Wetterling, 41, a chiropractor and president of the St. Cloud
chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People.
   They described Jacob as an all-around student who loved to study
math and play goalie on a youth-league hockey team.
   Ms. Wetterling said she expects Jacob is trying to befriend his
captor in an effort to escape. ``He's incredibly patient,'' she
said. She added that the boy hopes to be a veterinarian.
   ``Jacob's at an age where the world is full of possibilities,''
Ms. Wetterling said.
   Wetterling said they had received no ransom demands and doubts
his civil rights activism is a factor in the abduction. ``It's an
abnormal situation,'' he said.
   The kidnapping shook this quiet town, which is the home the
College of St. Benedict and is near the Collegeville campus of St.
John's University, the two schools where Sorem is associate
professor of psychology. Pictures of Jacob have been posted in
store windows throughout the area.
   Mark Bina, who lives near the Wetterlings, said he ordered his
children to stay home at night. ``When it's dark, they're in.
They're throwing a fit about it,'' Bina said.
   Sandy Larson, whose daughter goes to school with the Wetterling
children, said she is taking her kids elsewhere to trick-or-treat
on Halloween.
   ``We're new in the area. I'm taking them to our old
neighborhood,'' she said.
   FBI spokesman Byron Giglerd said 20 agents have been assigned to
the case.
   The FBI released a personality profile of the type of person
likely to have kidnapped Jacob. According to the profile, the
kidnapper is probably a sex offender, a white male 25 to 35 years
old, with some type of physical deformity, and is likely to work at
some type of unskilled job.

<HEAD>Justice Minister Orders Extradition of Reputed California Serial
Killer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The justice minister on Thursday ordered Charles
Ng extradited to the United States to face murder charges in a
string of sex-torture slayings.
   Ng still could appeal the ruling and continue his four-year
fight against extradition to California, where he is accused of
murdering 12 people.
   In a letter to defense lawyer Don MacLeod, Lewis rejected
defense arguments that he should refuse extradition unless
California agrees to refrain from imposing the death penalty on Ng.
   MacLeod had argued that the death penalty is cruel and inhumane
and that there is evidence it is applied in a racially biased
manner. He also raised questions about the jury selection process
and the independence of California judges.
   But Lewis concluded that the U.S. Constitution and criminal law
protect the rights of the accused.
   ``Canada accepts and has confidence in the body of criminal law
and the manner in which it is administered in the United States,''
said the minister.
   The fact that the death penalty has been abolished in Canada
does not make extradition impossible under the Canadian charter, he
said.
   If criminals knew that by fleeing to Canada they could escape a
death sentence elsewhere, ``Canada would become a safe haven for
such criminals. In my view, such a prospect is simply
unacceptable,'' he said.
   Ng, a native of Hong Kong who was educated in Britain and served
in the U.S. Marines, is charged with murder, kidnapping and
burglary in the deaths of 12 men, women and children.
   Eleven deaths involved sex slayings at a cabin 120 miles east of
San Francisco. The 12th involved the slaying of a San Francisco
disc jockey.
   Ng, 28, is serving a 4{-year sentence for shooting a security
guard in the hand in a bungled shoplifting attempt in Calgary in
1985. He has been fighting to avoid extradition upon completion of
his sentence.
   The Supreme Court of Canada, in a ruling delivered in August,
upheld lower court rulings in favor of extradition.
   Under the Canada-U.S. extradition treaty, the final decision
rests with the federal justice minister, who has the option of
refusing to extradite any prisoner unless American authorities
agree not to impose the death penalty.
   Now that Lewis has ruled in the case, his decision could in turn
be challenged in the courts in a second round of appeals.
   Ng came to Canada after his alleged accomplice in the
sex-and-torture slayings, Leonard Lake, was arrested for
shoplifting in San Francisco and subsequently committed suicide.
   Lake later was linked to the grisly killings and disappearances
of several people, and the investigation led to the charges against
Ng.

<HEAD>Ruble Devaluation Silence Leaves Experts Confused</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union's failure to communicate clearly
the limits on a drastic devaluation of the ruble left confused
experts, businessmen and travelers scrambling for clarification
Thursday.
   Wednesday's announcement that the ruble would fall from $1.59 to
16 cents, but only for certain transactions, was of enormous
importance in international trade. But where most governments are
careful to speak quickly and precisely on such issues to avoid
upsetting markets, the Soviet bureaucracy dribbled out confusing,
conflicting tidbits of information.
   The original Tass announcement on Wednesday raised more
questions than it answered. It was only an Izvestia newspaper
article hours later that said the lower rate would apply to
foreigners and those Soviets going abroad, but not to commercial
transactions. Still, there were gaping holes left, and on Thursday,
officials offered contradictory clarifications.
   ``It doesn't seem to show a lot of coordination,'' one Western
diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``Here we all
are, stumbling around trying to figure out what it means.''
   Several Westerners said they were told by highly placed Soviet
officials that foreign businessmen and diplomats living in Moscow
would enjoy the new, more favorable exchange rate.
   But Vladislav Lashinsky of the State Bank's protocol department
said the lower rate would apply only to foreign tourists, not to
foreign residents.
   Foreign businessmen were left to speculate whether they could
finance operations at the lower rate by bringing in tourists from
the home office once a month carrying cash. One diplomat wondered
if he would be able to buy a round-trip ticket from Moscow to New
York on Aeroflot for $150.
   Lashinsky also said the lower rate will affect only the
conversion of cash and traveler's checks, not purchases made by
credit card.
   Neither the government tourist agency Intourist nor the network
of state hard-currency stores were able to say how the new exchange
rate would affect their sales, which are priced in rubles but paid
in dollars or other hard currency.
   The change will help sop up some of the estimated 400 billion
rubles of unspendable savings that is contributing to the country's
severe shortages.
   Izvestia said the devaluation was designed to restrict a serious
drain on the national treasury's foreign currency reserves by
Soviet tourists flooding out to sample the once-forbidden fruits of
the West. Though each has been allowed to convert a mere 200 rubles
to foreign currency on leaving the country, they have been paid at
the official, lop-sided rate _ terrible for foreigners but great
for Soviets.
   ``When, thanks to new thinking and a new policy in the area of
human rights, thousands and hundreds of thousands of our citizens
have received the possibility of free exit, even the sale of a
limited sum of hard currency at a symbolic price in rubles presents
a serious financial problem,'' Izvestia said.
   The devaluation could be disastrous for Soviet tourists, who
instead of setting off overseas with $318 in their pockets will
have only $31.95 _ unless the government raises the 200-ruble limit
on how much they can exchange. The change is scheduled to take
effect Nov. 1.
   Even if the limit is altered, Soviets would have to pay 1,252
rubles _ or more than five months' average salary _ instead of 200
rubles to receive that same $318 in spending money.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on Thursday
defended plans to send thousands of Vietnamese back to their
Communist homeland and said it is no different than the United
States' deportation of illegal aliens.
   Having already made clear its refusal to take in Hong Kong
Chinese when the colony reverts to Chinese rule, the government is
facing additional public disapproval with its stance on the boat
people.
   Most of the 56,000 Vietnamese in Hong Kong are being held in
crowded, prison-like detention centers, where violence, rioting and
infectious diseases have broken out.
   Britain maintains the majority have not fled political or
religious persecution but are simply seeking a better standard of
living than that available in Vietnam.
   Each is being screened in accordance with standards set by the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and Mrs. Thatcher
told the House of Commons that only 13,000 have been declared
genuine refugees.
   The Foreign Office said Britain and Vietnam have been discussing
for several weeks how to handle the repatriation of those refused
permission to stay in Hong Kong.
   It would not say when a decision is expected or how many people
would be affected. Newspaper reports put the figure as high as
40,000 and said Britain is considering chartering aircraft to take
them back.
   Foreign Secretary John Major said Wednesday the influx of
Vietnamese into densely populated Hong Kong ``cannot be borne much
longer.''
   ``We are seeking to cajole and persuade the Vietnamese boat
people to return, but I now have to recognize that the problem in
Hong Kong is acute and getting worse,'' he said.
   Britain's opposition Labor Party opposes forcible repatriation.
When lawmakers confronted Mrs. Thatcher with the issue Thursday,
one of them reminded her of the outrage in Britain over the 1972
mass expulsion of Asians from Uganda.
   Mrs. Thatcher retorted: ``Most countries repatriate illegal
immigrants... That is to say, we also put back over the Chinese
border some 35,000 illegal immigrants from China into Hong Kong
each year. The United States repatriates people to Mexico and
Haiti. There's nothing unusual about deporting to repatriate.''
   Britain is expected to pay some compensation to the boat people
it sends back so they can buy tools and seeds on their return. A
Foreign Office spokesman said it would likely be comparable to the
$600 paid to boat people who go home voluntarily.
   So far, 386 have returned voluntarily to Vietnam and another 600
to 700 have agreed to, he said.
   An international conference in Geneva in June concluded that
non-refugees must go back to Vietnam, but it could not agree on
when or how this should be done.
   Japan also has had an influx of Vietnamese boat people. So far,
3,372 boat people supposedly from Vietnam have arrived in Japan
this year, compared with 219 in all of 1988. But immigration
officials have found at least 1,642 Chinese nationals trying to
enter Japan by posing as Vietnamese refugees.
   A small wooden vessel believed to be carrying about 100 boat
people was sighted Thursday in the East China Sea off southwestern
Japan, the Maritime Safety Agency reported.
   A coast guard plane confirmed sighting the boat, flying a
Vietnamese flag and a white flag marked SOS.

   Four state agents, including an arson
expert, began an investigation Thursday of an explosion at an Amoco
gas processing plant that killed one man and injured 11.
   ``The prime thing is to find out what happened and to see also
if there were any violations of OSHA rules,'' said Steve Foster,
assistant administrator for the state Occupational Health and
Safety Commission. That agency sent three investigators and the
fourth came from the State Fire Marshal's office.
   A malfunctioning valve in a compressor building at Amoco's
Anschutz Ranch East Gas Processing Plant may have caused the leak
that led to Wednesday's explosion, but ``we're not absolutely
certain,'' Amoco spokesman Dick Brewster said Thursday.
   He said static electricity could have ignited the gas, but
emphasized that was just a possibility.
   ``Had it not been for some unusual event, the gas might have
simply escaped and been vented outside of the building,'' Brewster
said. ``This is one of those tragic things where there shouldn't
have been ignition and there was.''
   David Phipps, plant operations center foreman, said workers had
little warning before the blast. They heard the hiss of gas
escaping just a few seconds before it ignited, he said.
   ``When it was realized there was gas escaping, they shut down
the compressor immediately and they were on their way out of the
building,'' Brewster said. ``Some were outside and some were just
inside.''
   He said there were 15 workers in the gas compressor building,
about one-quarter mile from the plant's main building in
southwestern Wyoming.
   The dead man was struck by one wall of the steel building that
was blown out by the blast.
   ``It appears as if he had just gotten out the door'' when the
explosion occurred, Brewster said.
   Brewster said a short fire followed the explosion.
   ``Once the explosion occurred the fire was over'' because the
supply of gas to the building was cut off as soon as the leak was
detected, he said.
   Brewster said the plant had a good safety record. Before
Wednesday's explosion, no workers had lost time on the job because
of an injury in seven years.

<HEAD>US: Gadhafi Still Supports Terrorism Despite Denials</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department said Thursday that Libyan
leader Moammar Gadhafi was not telling the truth when he asserted
that he has halted support for international terrorist activities.
   Spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Libya is still supplying
funds, weapons, safe havens and training facilities to such groups
as the Japanese Red Army, the Provisional Irish Republican Army,
the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command
and other terrorist groups.
   In addition, she said the ``notorious Abu Nidal organization,''
a Palestinian group otherwise known as the Fatah Revolutionary
Council, is still headquartered in Tripoli.
   Gadhafi acknowledged to an interviewer during a visit to Egypt
that Libya once supported terrorist groups, but he said he halted
the aid once ``we discovered that these groups were causing more
harm than benefit to the Arab cause.''
   He said that hijacking planes and killing civilians are acts of
murder that have nothing to do with combat. Libya, he added,
``should not be called to account for any of these acts because we
have withdrawn our support of such groups,'' he said.
   But Ms. Tutwiler said Libya is ``still trying to acquire
chemical weapons capability and is engaged in destabilizing efforts
around the world.
   ``We want to see irrevocable actions, not pronouncements or
short term adjustments that can be reversed.''
   The U.S. government, she said, ``is interested in actions, not
words.''
   In the interview, Gadhafi said he would welcome a dialogue with
the United States on the possibility of establishing friendlier
relations.
   ``We do not believe that conflict with the United States is
necessary,'' he said.

   The State Department expressed regret Thursday
over Turkey's decision to suspend certain U.S. military activities
in that country.
   The Turkish action followed approval by the Senate Judiciary
Committee of a resolution honoring Armenians alleged to have been
killed by Turks between 1915 and 1923.
   ``We regret Turkey's action and urge its suspension,'' State
Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said.
   The Turkish measures included a halt to U.S. port visits,
suspension of meetings on military cooperation, restrictions on
modernization projects at U.S. military facilities in Turkey and a
halt to U.S. use of training facilities at a military site at Kona.

   The weather turned against volunteers
Thursday as they resumed the search for a 9-year-old boy missing
with his pony for more than three days in rugged south-central
Oregon.
   As the search began again at daybreak, heavy snow was falling
and the temperature was 20 degrees, said Klamath County search and
rescue spokeswoman Betty Lucht.
   The snow continued through the morning as about 130 people
looked for the boy, about a third of them on horseback, said
sheriff's spokesman Dexter Patmon.
   Nathan Madsen, who lives in rural Veneta, disappeared Sunday
afternoon while herding cattle with his family during an annual
roundup. Family members said the boy and his 10-year-old sorrel,
Tony, were inseparable and would have stayed together.
   The number of searchers Thursday was down from a high of about
350 the day before, but Patmon said that was not necessarily bad,
since more searchers might obscure signs of the boy and his horse,
confusing the situation.
   Lucht said a U.S. Forest Service crew of smokejumpers brought in
to search through the night determined that a set of hoofprints
found Wednesday did not belong to the missing boy's pony. Klamath
County Sheriff Carl Burkhart had called the hoofprints ``the first
good news'' since the search began, but Lucht said they turned out
to be prints left by a searcher's horse.
   Contingency plans were in place to airlift the child to a
hospital in Bend if he is found, said Maj. Pat Kelly of the U.S.
Air Force Reserve's 304th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron.
The unit sent two helicopters and a military transport airplane to
the area Wednesday to help in the search.
   The poor weather kept the helicopters grounded Thursday morning,
however, said sheriff's dispatcher Becky Collins.
   The temperature was below freezing for the fourth straight
night, but the sheriff said authorities were optimistic about the
boy's chances.
   The boy was dressed in a slicker and chaps, and his mother,
Sarah Madsen, said earlier that she was confident her son could
take care of himself until he is found.

<HEAD>Warsaw Pact Foreign Ministers Meet in Warsaw</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The seven Warsaw Pact foreign ministers
assessed the revolutionary changes taking place in the East bloc
Thursday at the military alliance's first meeting since Solidarity
took over the leadership in Poland.
   Non-communist Foreign Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski of Poland
welcomed the Warsaw Pact's foreign affairs committee as well as the
ministers for foreign trade from each country also invited to
attend the two days of talks.
   Skubiszewski stressed that despite the government change, Poland
wants to ``maintain friendly, mutually advantageous ties'' with its
Warsaw Pact partners, and ``strict respect of mutual interests on
the principle of equal rights.''
   Although not officially on the agenda, changes sweeping the
region were expected to be the main topic in informal moments of
the meeting.
   Since the foreign ministers last met a year ago, the once-banned
Solidarity movement has taken the reins of government in Poland,
Hungary's communist party has dissolved itself and become a
democratic leftist party and the aging hardline leader of East
Germany, Erich Honecker, has been replaced by a younger man
promising reform and dialogue with the opposition.
   Meanwhile, the Soviet Union continues to press ahead with change
in its fourth year under the leadership of Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
Only Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and particularly Romania have
resisted the trend toward reform.
   Illustrating the gulf of attitudes the pervade the alliance,
Romania as recently as August tried to rally its Warsaw Pact allies
to intervene to halt the formation of a Solidarity-led government
as a threat to socialism, according to documents leaked in Poland.
The proposal found no support.
   ``It is not customary for the committee of foreign ministers to
discuss internal affairs of any country,'' said Foreign Ministry
spokesman Stefan Staniszewski of Poland. ``Nevertheless, I think
the ministers taking part in the meeting will find an opportunity
to share news and opinions concerning their countries.''
   He also said that ``certain problems concerning the future and
evolution of the pact will be discussed.''
   Skubiszewski told his fellow foreign ministers that he hoped the
session would contribute ``to the construction of a lasting
foundation of one, indivisible Europe.''
   Developments in East Germany, shaken by protests and the exodus
this year of 100,000 of its citizens, have renewed discussion on
German reunification and even brought into question the future of
two rival military alliances that have formed the basic
geopolitical structure of Europe since the late 1940s.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said in Moscow on
Monday that the Soviet Union would be interested in negotiating the
dissolution of both NATO and the Warsaw Pact by the year 2000.
   ``For the time being though, the two alliances do exist and one
should aim for their gradually being transformed into
political-military organizations through developing civilian trends
of their activity with a simultaneous reduction of all military
elements,'' Shevardnadze told PAP in Warsaw.
   In addition to the broader issues, Warsaw Pact foreign trade
ministers were also invited to the meeting to discuss ground rules
for reforming economic cooperation within the pact.
   ``Reformist tendencies in Eastern Europe, which are gaining new
territory apart from the traditional centers of ferment in Warsaw
and Budapest, cause questions about the future of the Warsaw
Pact,'' said a commentary Thursday in the daily Zycie Warszawy.
   The article, titled ``Ties, Chains or Alliance,'' said greater
flexibility should be allowed among the pact countries, while
respecting the strategic interests of the dominant partner, the
Soviet Union.
   ``All the reforms which no one could have imagined a few years
ago will be accepted in Moscow, unless they lead to the questioning
of membership in the Warsaw Pact,'' the commentary said.
   ``Efforts aimed at renovating the Warsaw Pact are gaining new
force, which will speed up the final results,'' the article said.
   The Warsaw Pact, the East bloc military alliance founded in
Warsaw in 1955 after the formation of NATO by the United States and
Western Europe, consists of the Soviet Union, Poland, East Germany,
Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria.

   President Carlos Menem said
Thursday he will not give in to wage demands by unions, depite
widespread strikes and growing opposition to his 4-month-old
government.
   ``Let them protest,'' Menem said of the strikes, which have
involved teachers, subway workers, metal workers, court staff and
employees at public ministries. ``Nobody is restraining their
constitutional right and freedom to express their thought and
sentiments.''
   Menem made his statement to journalists after attending a
celebration honoring the federal police.
   The government has offered public employees an across-the-board
raise of 12,000 australs, or about $16 a month, through March 1990.
It told businesses their wage increases above 15 percent for that
period may not be added to prices.
   Higher salary increases would fuel inflation, which has been
reduced through devaluation and wage and price guidelines to about
7 percent this month. In July, it was 197 percent.
   The 350,000-member metalworkers union has demanded an 82 percent
pay raise, which it claims is necessary to make up for cuts in real
wages during recent months.
   Postal workers are seeking a 100 percent pay raise, and bus
drivers, subway employees, teachers, airline personnel and others
have demanded increases of up to 110 percent.
   On Wednesday, unions representing employees at public ministries
listened for five minutes to Labor Ministry undersecretary Roberto
Digon, then stormed out of the collective bargaining session.
   ``We listened as the 12,000 austral payment was made official,
but walked out because the offer cannot be modified and leaves no
room for a counterproposal,'' said Andres Rodriguez, a delegate of
the National Civil Personnel Union.
   The increase would bring monthly wages for most members of his
union to about $78, Rodriguez said.
   The wage issue is a key test of the government's commitment to
quell inflation, which has ranged between 100 percent and 1,000
percent for years. The cost of living soared by 3,826.4 percent
during the first nine months of this year.
   The government also has introduced controversial legislation to
privatize state industries, attract foreign capital and revamp tax
collections to narrow the perennial fiscal deficit.
   Governors of Menem's Peronist Party have spoken out against cuts
in federal subsidies to businesses, banks and payrolls in their
provinces.
   Economy Minister Nestor Rapanelli has quarreled with top Menem
advisers over which must take precedence: quelling inflation or
restarting an economy in recession, even if that means inflation in
1990 is slightly higher than the government target of 15 percent.
   The value of the austral has slipped in relation to the dollar.
Argentina's national currency officially is worth 655 per dollar.
In black market trading Thursday, people who wanted to buy dollars
with australs paid about 735 per dollar.
   Prices of goods in supermarkets and clothing stores edged upward
by 10 percent to 20 percent in the past two weeks, newspapers
reported.

   The government is settling a lawsuit filed by
the widow of a Communist Party leader who was ostracized by his
colleagues after the bureau planted a forged document falsely
suggesting the man was an informant.
   The $177,000 settlement which will go to the widow of William
Albertson of New York City is the largest ever made in connection
with abuses by the FBI's COINTELPRO operation, the American Civil
Liberties Union said Thursday.
   Under COINTELPRO, which stands for counter-intelligence program,
the FBI used a variety of tactics to disrupt anti-war groups, civil
rights advocates and radical organizations in the United States.
The program ended in 1971.
   Albertson was a national committee member of the Communist Party
in 1964 when the FBI created a phony report in which Albertson
appeared to be asking his FBI handler for more money, according to
internal bureau documents released as part of a lawsuit filed by
Albertson's wife, Lillie.
   The FBI slipped the hand-written document signed ``Bill'' into a
car in which Albertson rode to party meetings.
   Party members found the note, confronted Albertson, didn't
believe his denials that the document, which appeared to be in his
handwriting, was forged and kicked him out of the party.
   He was stripped of his job running a party-owned bookstore, his
wife and mother were expelled from the party and his children bore
the stigma of having an informer for a father.
   The FBI agents who set up the operation were recommended for
incentive awards, according to a July 7, 1964 FBI headquarters memo
released as part of the Albertson case.
   In a message to the field, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover said
headquarters ``is extremely pleased'' with the ``sophisticated and
imaginative counterintelligence action'' against Albertson.
   Albertson spent the next eight years trying to clear his name
with party officials and became increasingly depressed because he
was having difficulty finding work, his wife said.
   ``It was really the destruction of a human being,'' Mrs.
Albertson told a news conference at ACLU offices. ``It's just not
something the government should be doing.
   ``He was committeed to socialism, the Community Party, the labor
movement. His mother said it would have been better had they killed
him.''
   She said some of her husband's old party colleagues have told
her recently that they never really believed he was an informer,
but she said some of those same people denounced him at the time.
   The settlement ends a dispute over information the Justice
Department says would endanger national security if it were
publicly disclosed in the course of the lawsuit.
   The department invoked the state-secret privilege to protect the
information but a federal appeals court ruled 2-1 this year that
Albertson could proceed with the case.
   In a dissent, appeals court Judge Douglas Ginsburg said the
government had a ``legitimate and compelling interest in preventing
disclosure of exceedingly senstive national security information.''
   Disclosure of evidence would ``pose a serious risk to the
personal safety'' of government informants, Assistant FBI director
James Geer said in an affidavit.
   Under the settlement, the ACLU agreed to move jointly with the
government to vacate the appeals court opinion. This would mean the
apeallate court decision would not have any legal significance as a
precedent.
   As part of the settlement, the Justice Department will withdraw
a petition for Supreme Court review of the case.
   Both sides stipulated that the settlement was not ``an admission
of liability or fault'' by the U.S. government.

<TEXT>
   The Justice Department charged Thursday that a
Pittsburgh suburb is violating federal civil rights law by
restricting the number of group homes for disabled people.
   The department's civil rights division sought to join a private
lawsuit against Moon Township, Pa., by three mentally retarded
persons who are trying to prevent their eviction from a group home.
   The lawsuit challenges a township zoning ordinance stating that
group homes cannot be located within a mile of one another, a
restriction the Justice Department contended discriminates against
residents of such facilities.
   Moon Township Manager Greg Smith said the suburb has 14 or 15
group homes and didn't object to others moving in, but enacted the
ordinance because township officials wanted the handicapped
residents to have a normal neighborhood setting rather than be
concentrated in a few areas.
   The issue came to a head when four or five group homes opened in
one apartment complex, he said.
   ``We didn't want to have one home after another in a row. We
wanted a normal situation,'' Smith said. ``Our basis was, spread
them out so that one neighborhood wouldn't be inundated.''
   The zoning code ``makes dwellings unavailable to persons on
account of handicap in violation'' of the Fair Housing Act, the
Justice Department said. It sought an injunction to prevent the
township from enforcing the provision.
   The Justice Department's action marks the first time the federal
government has sought under the newly amended Fair Housing Act to
set aside a zoning ordinance on the ground it is discriminatory,
said spokesman David Runkel.
   The fair-housing amendments, which took effect last spring,
prohibit housing discrimination on the basis of a handicap. The law
allows the department to intervene in private discrimination
lawsuits.
   ``The Justice Department intends to use all of the new
enforcement tools at our disposal under the amended Fair Housing
Act to redress housing discrimination,'' James P. Turner, acting
head of the civil rights division, said in a statement.
   In June, the department filed a suit charging that Chicago
Heights, Ill., had violated the Fair Housing Act by denying a
special-use permit for the construction of a group home for 15
mentally retarded adults. That case is still pending in federal
court in Chicago.

   A $1 million donation on Thursday by a
British corporation that makes hot tubs was the latest in more than
$8 million worth of foreign aid that has poured into Northern
California since last week's quake.
   Governments and foreign corporations that have ties to the
region have sent money. Costa Rican president Oscar Arias sent
2,500 pounds of coffee Thursday.
   The largest contributors have been the Japanese, who have
pledged more than $7 million in earthquake aid, prompting
expressions of thanks Thursday from former President Ronald Reagan
during his tour of Japan.
   All of the aid is designed to assist residents stunned by the
Oct. 17 quake that caused an estimated $7.1 billion worth of damage
to the region.
   Hanson Industries of Great Britain sent a $1 million check to
the Red Cross disaster relief fund to be used to help victims of
the San Francisco quake and Hurricane Hugo, the Red Cross announced.
   The company owns Jacuzzi Whirlpool Bath and Spa, Inc., of nearby
Walnut Grove, Calif., as well as Faberware cookware, Kaiser Cement
and other businesses, Sir James Murray, advisor to chairman Sir
Gordon White, said in a telephone interview from New York.
   Murray, a former British consul general in San Francisco, said
the company has 60,000 employees in the U.S., and White wanted to
help the nation recover from Hurricane Hugo and the earthquake.
   ``Whether it's famine in Biafra or the earthquake in Armenia,
Americans always are in the lead,'' Murray said. ``When they have a
natural disaster of the proportion of the West Coast quake or
Hurricane Hugo it's only right their friends should help.''
   Other major foreign donations to the fund include $570,000 from
Sony, $500,000 from Sanywa Bank, $200,000 from Toshiba, and
$200,000 from American Honda.
   The money will go towards the $20 million goal the Red Cross has
announced for earthquake victims and the $42 million they want to
raise for victims of Hurricane Hugo, said Barb Lohman of the Red
Cross.
   The Costa Rican coffee was slated for relief workers and shelter
residents in hard-hit Los Gatos, Santa Cruz, Watsonville and
Hollister, said Callie Gregory, a spokeswoman for San Jose, Calif.
   ``From San Jose, Costa Rica, to our sister city San Jose,
California,'' say the sacks of coffee.
   The government of Taiwan has donated $250,000 to the state of
California and another $250,000 to the city of San Francisco. A
Taiwanese province that is a sister state to California added
$100,000, according to the Taiwan consulate in San Francisco.
   The city of San Francisco has received about $1 million in small
donations, most from other countries, said Eileen Maloney, press
secretary to Mayor Art Agnos. That includes money from companies
and from Japanese schoolchildren, she said.
   In addition, 12 Japanese students who traveled to San Jose to
help victims brought $25,000 with them, said Bev Cubbage of the
Salvation Army.
   Foreign banks have also chipped in. The Bank of California-The
Mitsubishi Bank, Ltd. of Tokyo donated $300,000 and the Banque
National de Paris contributed $100,000 to a special relief campaign
set up by a local television station.
   Peggy McGinley of the Red Cross said other Japanese
contributions include: Bank of the West, $100,000; Industrial Bank
of Japan, $100,000; Duty Free Shoppers Group, $50,000; Hitachi,
$100,000; Union Bank, $100,000; Bank of Tokyo, $100,000;
Kanematsu-Gosho (USA) $20,000; C.Itoh and Co., $50,000; Nissho Iwai
American Corp. $50,000; Kyowa Bank, $50,000; Kikoman Soy Sauce,
$100,000; and Sumitomo Corp., $100,000.

<HEAD>UN High Commissioner for Refugees Resigns Amid Scandal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN ^Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.N. high commissioner for refugees
resigned Thursday amid allegations of financial impropriety,
mismanagement and favoritism to Western donor nations.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar accepted Jean-Pierre
Hocke's resignation effective Wednesday, said U.N. spokesman
Francois Giuliani.
   On Tuesday, Denmark called for an investigation of Hocke's use
of Danish refugee funds for first-class air travel.
   Hocke's letter to Perez de Cuellar, read out by Giuliani, said:
   ``At a time when you have decided, based on a first evaluation
which has just been presented to you, to prolong and intensify an
investigation which you initiated, I do not wish my presence at the
head of HCR to complicate in any way the ongoing investigation.''
   Perez de Cuellar has received a report by U.N. auditors on
Hocke's use of funds, but its conclusions have not been disclosed.
   Hocke became high commissioner for refugees in 1986 as the
favored candidate of the U.S. State Department.
   The commissioner is officially responsible for at least 12
million refugees worldwide, although there are many more than that.
A separate U.N. agency helps Palestinian refugees.
   Officials of private relief agencies had expressed concern that
Hocke was bending to the restrictive national polices of major
donor nations rather than speaking out as the protector of refugees
worldwide.
   Western nations are adopting more restrictive refugee policies,
accepting only those who can prove they are politically persecuted
and excluding economic refugees.
   ``We do think that Hocke was ... protective of the more
restrictive actions taken by some developed governments, including
the United States,'' said Roger Winter, director of the U.S.
Committee of Refugees, an umbrella group for refugee agencies.
   Hocke's latest problems began in September, when Swiss
Television reported that internal documents showed he had drawn
$300,000 since 1987 from a special ``educational fund'' set up by
Sweden and Denmark to fly first class instead of business class.
   Hocke admitted he had flown first class, a right reserved only
for Perez de Cuellar under stringent U.N. austerity measures, but
denied any impropriety. He said he had flown first class on some
long intercontinental flights when he had a busy work schedule.
   Hocke's agency is struggling with a budget shortfall of $40
million.
   Part of the criticism that he did not challenge the refugee
policies of major donor nations came in January 1988 when he
ordered the burning of all 138,000 copies of the agency's monthly
magazine, ``Refugees,'' because it contained an article critical of
West Germany's policy.
   Hocke said the article was dated and that West Germany's
policies were improving. The act greatly embarrassed Bonn, however.
   A year ago, an internal report by the U.N. Panel on
Discrimination and other Grievances criticized Hocke's management
practices.
   The report condemned the ``personalization and centralization of
authority around the high commissioner'' as being part of the cause
of ``the rapidly growing management crisis'' at the refugee agency.
   Hocke's staff was so demoralized that they began leaking
documents to undermine him, U.N. officials have said. Among the
documents were the air travel expense reports.
   Gerald Hinteregger, an Austrian who heads the Geneva-based U.N.
Economic Commission for Europe, will serve as interim commissioner
until Perez de Cuellar selects a replacement, Giuliani said.
   The refugee agency spends about $500 million in aid money
annually. It has a staff of 2,300 people, including 800 in Geneva,
and the rest as field specialists.
   The United States, Japan, and West Germany are the leading
contributors, in that order.
   Hocke was a former director of operations of the International
Committee of the Red Cross.

<HEAD>Coleman Young Looks Like a Winner for Fifth Term</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Call it a walkaway, a shoo-in, a breeze or a
coronation, but a mayor by any other name than Coleman A. Young
doesn't look likely this election year despite the incumbent's 71
years, four terms in office and a well-known paternity suit.
   Two of his rivals in the primary have fallen in behind him, the
Rev. Jesse Jackson has come into the fold after a long-standing
coolness, and Young has refused to debate his opponent saying there
is nothing to talk about since the man has no record to discuss.
   The man who wants to stop Young from winning an unprecedented
fifth term on Nov. 7 is accountant Tom Barrow, 40, who has never
held office and who lost to Young in 1985 by 39 percent to 61
percent.
   Barrow entered this year's general election campaign with the
momentum of his non-partisan primary victory on Sept. 12 over
13-term Congressman John Conyers and City Council President Erma
Henderson.
   Conyers and another mayoral also-ran, paint store owner Charles
Costa, endorsed Young at the same news conference last week at
which Jackson announced his support. Henderson has held out, even
though she appeared at the press conference and despite Young's
suggestion two weeks ago that the city council name a park in her
honor.
   Results of a poll conducted for WJBK-TV and the Wayne State
University Center for Urban Studies released Wednesday showed Young
with 46 percent to Barrow's 29 percent with 17 percent undecided
and 8 percent refusing to answer. The poll of 310 registered voters
had a margin of error of plus or minus 5.5 percent.
   A poll conducted earlier this month for the Detroit Free Press
showed Young with 51 percent to 35 percent for Barrow with 14
percent undecided.
   Jackson's endorsement seemed like the final blow. Young had
incurred Jackson's wrath by supporting Michael Dukakis in the 1988
Democratic presidential primary, and by frequently criticizing
Jackson's credentials to run for president. Jackson supported
Conyers in the primary.
   ``People who might have decided to support Barrow just aren't
going to take a chance on him now,'' Wilbur Rich, a political
science professor at Wayne State University and the author of a
Young biography, said Thursday.
   Even the paternity lawsuit earlier this year was settled
amicably. Young set up a trust fund for his 7-year-old son, Joel
Loving, and will provide for the boy through his 25th birthday.
   Young has campaigned steadily, appearing at groundbreakings,
anniversaries and ribbon-cuttings, as well as at dozens of the
city's black churches.
   He started the campaign with a fund of nearly $5 million. Actor
James Earl Jones did the voice-overs for some of his early
television ads. Barrow's total fund is said to be less than
$250,000.
   Rich said Barrow's lack of political experience has hindered him
from getting support from other politicians. ``He hasn't paid his
dues, and he's indicating that he isn't going to pay them,'' Rich
said.
   Barrow's campaign strategy generally has been one of attacking
Young's leadership.
   He has said this may be his last run for mayor, even though
Young has indicated he will step aside in 1993 after two decades in
office.
   ``I don't think I have another shot,'' Barrow said. ``I think
this is it.''

<HEAD>Sponsors of Failed Abortion Amendment Say They'll Try Again</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sponsor of a failed proposal to allow
Medicaid abortions for rape and incest victims said Thursday that
pressure will build on President Bush to change his mind while she
and allies look for a new opportunity to press the issue in
Congress.
   Rep. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., sent a letter to Bush on Thursday
_ signed by 74 members of Congress _ asserting that a congressional
majority favors the expansion of federally financed abortion.
   They urged him not to again veto bills to which Congress may add
similar language, a move that could put the abortion issue at the
center of an impasse between the White Hosue and Congress.
   ``We urge you to accept the will of the majority and not hold
any more bills hostage in order to exert a minority view,'' the
letter said.
   The House sustained Bush's veto Wednesday on a 231-191 vote, 51
fewer than the two-thirds majority needed to overturn a veto. Two
weeks earlier the House for the first time in this decade voted to
relax the restrictions on Medicaid abortions.
   The vote followed Bush's veto on Saturday of the provision,
which is but a paragraph in a $156.7 billion appropriations bill
for health, education and labor programs for the 1990 fiscal year
that began Oct. 1.
   Boxer, in an interview, said she and her allies have not decided
whether to try to attach the same, vetoed provision to the same
bill, which has now been sent back to the House Appropriations
Committee.
   House Speaker Tom Foley said the Democratic leadership in the
House has not decided on how to handle the spending bill but said
he expected further efforts to push the more liberal abortion
provisions in an effort to force Bush to relent.
   ``I wasn't surprised by the outcome, but it's not going to be
the last, I think, we'll hear on this issue this year,'' Foley said.
   House Republican Leader Robert Michel of Illinois told reporters
that ``maybe some adjustments will have to be made'' in the current
Medicaid prohibitions because of the changing House sentiment.
Michel voted with Bush on the issue but said he has always favored
permitting abortion in cases of rape or incest.
   Claiming that the vote was a victory because it showed there is
now a majority in the House and Senate in support of broader
abortion rights, Boxer said her side was content to ``let the issue
percolate'' while it decided where next to push it.
   ``We're going to win it eventually,'' she said. ``Just keep
building pressure on the president. ... We're going to let people
contemplate what's happened and how times are changing on this
issue.''
   In their letter, the members of Congress said that in past years
they had gone along with the more restrictive abortion provisions
in passing the full spending bill even though they objected to the
abortion restrictions, known as the ``Hyde amendment.''
   ``The majority of the House has a new opinion on this, and it
should be respected, just as those of us who disagreed with the
restrictive Hyde amendment accepted it as the will of the House and
voted for the ... bill,'' the letter said.

   President Bush on Thursday signed a record
$3.45 billion disaster relief package, the bulk of the money bound
for California, and said ``our hearts go out to the victims'' of
the San Francisco Bay area earthquake.
   The president signed the legislation _ part of a short-term
spending bill _ at daybreak, after it won final congressional
approval the night before.
   Later, at a picture-taking session in the Oval Office with
members of the California delegation, Bush praised Congress for its
``great speed and compassion'' in enacting the measure so quickly.
   The package would provide $2.85 billion in new disaster relief
while freeing up another $600 million from other programs.
   The bulk of the money will go to California, but some of the
disaster funds also will be used to continue the process of
assisting East Coast victims of Hurricane Hugo.
   ``Our hearts go out to the victims and we are hopeful that this
action ... will send a signal that all of us, crossing party lines,
care very much about this,'' Bush said.
   The package is the largest federal relief effort ever for a
natural disaster. The quake, which measured 7.1 on the Richter
scale, struck the San Francisco Bay area on Oct. 17.
   The $2.85 billion in new funds includes $1.1 billon for the
Federal Emergency Management Agency for general disaster relief, $1
billion for the Federal Highway Administration for road and bridge
repair and $500 million for Small Business Administration disaster
loans.
   The rest is to be held in a disaster relief contingency fund to
be used by Bush as he sees fit.

   Carol L. Levy, a special agent in the
Agriculture Department, was recognized Thursday as the outstanding
woman in federal law enforcement.
   Levy, a native of suburban Chicago, Ill., was awarded the 1989
Julie Y. Cross Award by the Interagency Committee on Women in
Federal Law Enforcement. The award is named in honor of a U.S.
Secret Service agent killed in the line of duty.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said Levy, who works for
the department's Office of Inspector General in Hyattsville, Md.,
has ``exhibited great resourcefulness, demonstrated strong
leadership qualities and sound decison-making'' in her career.
   Levy, 35, was born in Evergreen Park, Ill., and began with the
agency in 1976 as an investigator in the Chicago regional office
after graduating from the University of Illinois at Chicago with a
degree in criminal justice and psychology.
   In 1987, she became the department's first female assistant
regional inspector general for investigations.

   President Bush says he won't confer with
Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega at a hemispheric meeting Friday,
but will use ``every chance I get'' to complain about Soviet-bloc
arms shipments to Nicaragua's Marxist government.
   ``We're not going down there to have some battle with Mr.
Ortega,'' Bush said before flying to Costa Rica for a two-day
celebration of that Central-American country's 100 years of
democracy. Ortega will be among the 18 heads of state engaging in
informal discussions at the meeting.
   Bush said he hoped the summit's focus on democratic government
``doesn't get cluttered up'' by members of the news media ``wanting
to see a picture of me and Ortega together.''
   Bush spoke in a White House interview with Latin-American
journalists on Wednesday. The transcript of his remarks was
released Thursday.
   The president said it was ``somewhat ironic that Mr. Ortega is
there to salute democracy, but nevertheless, so be it. That's
good.''
   If he does encounter Ortega at the summit, he said, ``it would
be very firm because I don't see why that one Sandinista regime is
swimming against the tide'' of democracy.
   Bush criticized Nicaragua's preparations for scheduled
presidential elections on Feb. 25 as unfair to opposition
candidates, and he denounced Soviet-bloc shipments of weapons and
ammunition to Ortega's Sandinista government.
   The Soviet Union has denied shipping arms to Nicaragua, but the
Bush administration nevertheless contends that Nicaragua is still
shipping Soviet-bloc weapons to Marxist rebels fighting the
U.S.-backed government of El Salvador.
   Asked if he would bring up that problem at the Costa Rica
meeting, Bush replied, ``I'll bring it up every chance I get.''
   The president said he also will ``continue to work with the
Soviet Union,'' which had promised to use its influence with
Nicaragua to halt arms exports.
   ``We will make clear every chance we get to the Soviets that
that is not in their interests, and certainly we view it against
the security interests of the United States and we view it against
the tide in terms of democracy,'' Bush said.
   The United States complained to Moscow on Wednesday about a arms
cache that was intercepted last week along the Nicaragua-Honduras
border and found to contain several Soviet-produced weapons. U.S.
officials said the shipment was headed for Salvadoran rebels.
   Referring to the Ortega government, the president asked, ``Why
should that military clique, who at one point were espousing their
own Marxist beliefs, deny, through having a military force far
bigger than is required and bigger than any of its neighbors, the
will of the people?''
   As he heads for Costa Rica, Bush said, ``I have no agenda with
Mr. Ortega. And as he takes a step that might lead to democracy,
great, I'm for that. But we're not going to solve any problems
there in Costa Rica. I'm there as a guest of the country.''
   Bush extended a 1985 trade embargo against Nicaragua on
Wednesday for another six months, and let the Costa Ricans know he
would refuse to sign any joint communique produced by the summit if
it bore Ortega's signature. The plan for such a statement was
scrapped after objections from other summit nations.

<HEAD>Bush Calls for Pesticide Rule Changes; Environmentalists Object</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush called for legislation Thursday
that would allow dangerous pesticides to be taken off the market
more quickly, saying the government's ability to ensure a safe food
supply was being called into question.
   But his proposed changes in how pesticides and other chemicals
on foods are regulated were criticized immediately by
environmentalists and some members of Congress who said provisions
of the president's plan could instead make foods less safe.
   While Bush's proposal to streamline regulation was praised,
critics said other provisions of his plan would ease the risk
levels used to determine if a pesticide is to be banned and also
would have the government preempt state pesticide-control laws that
often are stronger than federal rules.
   The president, in announcing the proposed legislation, alluded
to widespread publicity earlier this year over the use of Alar on
apples and the government's inability to remove the cancer-causing
chemical from the market swiftly.
   ``These stories have fueled the public concern about cancer
risks, and more important for us, have called into question the
government's ability to ensure a safe supply of food for our
citizens,'' said Bush in brief remarks at a White House photo
session with administration officials and members of Congress
involved in food safety issues.
   Bush said he was convinced the country has ``the safest food
supply in the world'' but that there also are ``valid concerns
about the government's slow and cumbersome process for removing
pesticides from the market.''
   The proposed food safety package, which administration officials
said would be sent to Congress within weeks, includes:
   _ Redefining the criteria to be used for temporarily removing,
or suspending, from use a pesticide that poses a possible health
hazard, making it easier to get the chemical off the market even
though formal proceedings might still be under way.
   _ Streamlining the procedures under which a dangerous pesticide
may be permanently removed from the market. Officials said the new
process would reduce by at least half the four-to-eight years it
often takes for a chemical to be banned.
   _ Providing tougher enforcement against misuse of pesticides,
including a proposal to increase penalties from $5,000 per day to
$25,000 per day for violations.
   Environmentalists welcomed those moves.
   However, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said, ``The administration
is taking one step forward and two steps back when it weakens
important food safety protection in exchange for some procedural
improvements in pesticide regulations.''
   Leahy, chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, said the
proposed shift in determining negligible risks from pesticides
would ``make the safety standards ten times weaker'' for chemicals
on some food products and could weaken them even more in some cases
where economic considerations are weighed heavily.
   Under the president's proposal, the Environmental Protection
Agency may not have to take action against a pesticide even with a
cancer risk as high as one in 100,000. Currently the standard is
one cancer case in 1 million people exposed to a substance.
   ``There is no justification for giving in to the pesticide
industry and weakening the health and safety standard,'' said Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.
   Kennedy, whose Labor Committee has been considering pesticide
regulations, said the provision in the president's plan that would
raise the risk levels at which action would be taken against a
chemical would ``weaken current federal health and safety
standards.''
   Environmental groups also denounced the changing of the risk
standard and the federal-state preemption provision.
   ``We're talking about the erosion of the concept of negligible
risks,'' said Janet Hathaway, an attorney for the Natural Resources
Defense Council, which has been a strong critic of current
government efforts to safeguard foods from high levels of
pesticides.
   She said that states ``have always had a central role in health
and safety'' and often prod the federal government to take action
against certain pesticide uses.
   William K. Reilly, administrator of the Environmental Protection
Agency, said the EPA needs risk standards that are flexible.
   While conceding the proposal calls for uniform federal standards
that would supersede state laws, Reilly said the EPA would consider
approval of stronger state provisions on a case-by-case basis.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter, said uniform pesticide
standards are needed for international trade purposes. ``State
governments should not have a standard that is different from those
of the federal government,'' he said.
   Dean Kleckner, president of the American Farm Bureau Federation,
said Bush's plan was ``a workable approach'' that would ``make the
world's safest food supply even safer.''
   ``Those who favor `zero tolerance' and farmers disarming
themselves and surrendering to all pests probably won't be happy
with this,'' Kleckner said. ``But they wouldn't be happy with the
disruptions in the food supply and distribution system that would
result from such policies, either.''

<HEAD>Jailed PTL Founder's Latest Church-Studio Losing Its Home</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The foundering new television ministry founded by Jim and Tammy
Bakker will have to move out of its shopping mall storefront after
Sunday's service, less than a week after Bakker began a 45-year
federal prison term for fraud.
   Bakker began serving his sentence at a federal prison in
Talladega, Ala., on Tuesday, the same day he was sentenced for
defrauding members of the defunct PTL Club and ministry of $3.7
million.
   ``They treated Jim like he was a dog. We've been through a lot,
but this is the worst,'' Bakker's mother, Furnia Bakker, said
Thursday from the home she and her husband have on the grounds of
Heritage USA, the now-padlocked retreat Bakker built at Fort Mill,
S.C., through his bankrupt PTL television ministry.
   The Bakkers have been operating the New Covenant Church and TV
ministry out of Orlando for the past five months.
   Bakker's oldest brother, Norm, who has been operations chief for
the combination church and television studio, said Wednesday that
the ministry's rental contract at Shoppers World mall extended to
the end of October.
   That is up Tuesday and the owner of the mall, Stewart Gilman,
said the ministry will have to move out. He already has signed a
lease with a new tenant who plans to use a major portion of the
plaza, in a tourist area between downtown Orlando and Walt Disney
World.
   A volunteer answering the ministry's telephone Thursday
identified himself only as ``Ed'' and said he had ``no comment and
no statements'' and said there was no activity at the studio.
   Norm Bakker said Wednesday that Sunday's service for local
supporters is planned to feature the Rev. Gene Kennett of Erie,
Pa.. who has substituted for Bakker in the past.
   Neither Tammy Bakker nor Norm Bakker could be reached Thursday
for further comment on their plans.
   Gilman said he did not ask the ministry to leave because of
Bakker's conviction and sentence, but because of the ministry's
actions.
   In the past few weeks, ministry volunteers have moved much of
their property into a smaller section of the plaza in hopes of
paying less rent. But Gilman said there had not been any change in
the rental contract.
   He said he would not interfere with Sunday's service.
   ``From my point of view, they should be out of there as soon as
it is possible or convenient for them to do so,'' he said.
   At last report, the new TV ministry had only five stations as
subscribers.
   Bakker's mother said Thursday she couldn't believe her son is in
prison.
   ``My husband just went to the doctor,'' Mrs. Bakker said. ``This
is awfully hard on both of us. We're both 83 and this is hard to
take. I was just trying to relax.''
   Mrs. Bakker and her husband, Raleigh, are among about 800 people
who have homes at Heritage USA, where a large sign at the front
entrance reads: ``Closed Until Further Notice.''
   ``We're not letting any cars in _ only residents and staff,''
said guard Mickey Rhymer.
   Bakker, 49, was taken immediately after sentencing taken to the
medium security Federal Correctional Institution at Talladega.
   Depending on the outcome of an appeal, he will serve at least 10
years before being eligible for parole.
   Prison officials said Thursday that Bakker appeared to be doing
well, but they declined to say much more about him. ``As far as I
know, he's adjusting well,'' said spokeswoman Dana Newell.
   She said the prison had received numerous requests from
reporters for interviews with Bakker and was referring those to his
lawyer.
   Baker is expected to stay at Talladega no more than two weeks
before he is transferred to another federal prison, which officials
declined to reveal.

Secretary James D. Watkins has recommended a further delay of at
least two years in starting operation of a defense nuclear waste
dump in New Mexico, a panel member said Thursday.
   The suggestion, if accepted, would mean the department would
have to arrange temporary storage of nuclear wastes for much longer
than currently planned, said Leonard Slosky, a member of the
advisory panel.
   The site, known as the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant and situated
just north of the Texas border near Carlsbad, N.M. is designed to
store drums of plutonium waste from nuclear weapons manufacture for
thousands of years in caves of bedded rock salt.
   Watkins had told Congress earlier this month that he expected to
have to persuade seven states to accept some excess waste starting
next April until about September 1992, when operational testing of
the permanent repository would start. Governors of the seven states
have told Watkins they won't take the waste.
   The seven states are Washington, Idaho, Colorado, New Mexico,
Nevada, Tennessee and South Carolina.
   The $800 million Carlsbad installation was supposed to have
opened a year ago, and as recently as June Watkins was saying it
would open in September of this year. In early October Watkins said
he hoped to accept experimental shipments next July but could not
say when full-scale operation should start.
   Four of the five advisory panel members told Watkins in a
private meeting Tuesday that the operational testing should be put
off at least an additional two years to 1994, Slosky said, in part
because the results of some scientific experiments won't be known
before then.
   The four also said they believed that the first phase of
experiments would take longer than the department has planned, and
that the tests should be broadened.
   Slosky said only Robert Bishop, representing an industry group,
disagreed with the recommendation to put off the operational
testing _ essentially an effort to show that the waste can be
safely loaded, shipped, unloaded, deposited in the dump and, if
necessary, retrieved.
   The panel wrote no joint report but instead the members
presented individual recommendations in separate papers for Watkins
on Tuesday, Slosky said.
   Department officials familiar with the reports declined to
return a telephone call Thursday. The department has not published
the papers.
   An environmental group said in response to the advisory panel's
recommendations that Watkins faced further delays and political
fights over the dump.
   ``For political and technical reasons, it's not going to open
anytime soon,'' said Elizabeth Kassen, a senior attorney for the
Environmental Defense Fund.
   The panel members also told Watkins they saw serious management
problems that should be corrected before the dump is opened.
   Slosky, an environmental consultant based in Denver, said in a
telephone interview that the panel members agreed that the site is
a good one and ``We have not uncovered anything that we think is a
fatal flaw.''

   Dr. Andrew Wiznia wrote his first AZT
prescription Thursday for a pediatric AIDS case: an 18-month-old
baby who weighs only 17 pounds and is unable to lift her head or
sit up.
   ``Even if the drug doesn't cure or at least improve (her
condition), hopefully it will stop at least some of the
deterioration,'' said Wiznia, the director of the pediatric AIDS
unit at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital.
   Until Thursday, doctors were not permitted to prescribe AZT, the
only government-approved anti-AIDS drug, for anyone under the age
of 13.
   But Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan lifted
the restriction, saying preliminary evidence indicated that the
drug is effective and seems to be safe.
   Children ages 3 months to 12 years who have symptoms of advanced
infection with the AIDS virus will be eligible to receive AZT free
under the program sponsored by the maker, Burroughs Wellcome Co. It
was previously only available to children enrolled in clinical
trials.
   Almost 1,900 children under 13 have AIDS, about 2 percent of all
AIDS cases, according to the national Centers for Disease Control.
   Pediatric AIDS specialists generally welcomed Thursday's news,
but cautioned that AZT was no more a cure-all in children than in
adults.
   Research studies that involved more than 200 children have
indicated that AZT may prolong their survival without raising the
risk of side effects.
   Anecdotal evidence has been mixed.
   Dr. Ayre Rubinstein, who has worked on pediatric AIDS for a
decade at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, has
used AZT for some time in symptomatic patients.
   One was a 6-year-old girl who lost the use of her legs from
progressive encephalopathy, a brain disease, he said. After
receiving AZT, ``there was a marked improvement.''
   Yet the same treatment had no effect when it was tried on
another patient.
   ``The same syndrome, about the same age,'' he said. ``So you can
see from that it's very hard to predict the outcome of the AZT on
brain disease.''
   Dr. Ed Connor, who runs the pediatric AZT trials at Children's
Hospital in Newark, N.J., said initial evidence indicates that
``the majority overall have benefited.''
   He mentioned one girl who has been receiving AZT by prescription
because she's over 13.
   ``She was losing weight and really not doing very well in
school,'' Connor said. ``She improved significantly and now
religiously takes her AZT because she's really seen the benefits.''
   AZT, also called zidovudine, was approved by the Food and Drug
Administration for teen-agers and adults with advanced symptoms of
AIDS in March 1987.
   Doctors Thursday praised the new form of AZT _ a
strawberry-flavored syrup that is easier for children to swallow
than capsules are. It also allows dosages to be adjusted for body
size.
   But all warn that there is still much to be learned about the
drug, which is highly toxic and can cause serious side effects such
as anemia and low white blood cell counts.
   Studies will continue to evaluate the effects on children of AZT
in combination with other drugs and the benefits of the drug when
used in children in earlier stages of the disease.
   ``The number of small children treated with AZT in this country
has been so small that I don't think you can make a statement as to
whether it's going to work,'' Wiznia said.
   Rubinstein said he will not use AZT as a prophylactic in his
pediatric clinic _ the largest in the country _ until more research
is done on the proper dosage.
   ``There are some people who say, `We are ready to take the
risks. It's a fatal disease. We'll prescribe it.'
   ``I don't think that's the right attitude,'' Rubinstein said.
   Physicians who want to enroll child patients in the AZT program
can call Burroughs Wellcome's toll-free number, 1-800-829-7337 from
8 a.m. to 7 p.m. EDT.

   Five national guardsmen on
patrol along the border with Colombia were killed Thursday when a
bomb exploded under their truck, military spokesmen said.
   No one claimed responsibility for the attack, but speculation
centered on the Colombian leftist guerrillas who operate along the
border.
   The truck carrying the five was on its way early Thursday from
El Nula to Cutufi, two towns several miles apart in Apure state
about 400 miles southwest of Caracas, said Gen. Rafael Caballero,
national guard commander in the region.
   A charge of dynamite was set off, killing all five aboard, he
said.
   Venezuelan and Colombian military authorities say leftist
Colombian guerrillas operate on both sides of the border.
Venezuelan forces have been beefed up in recent months following
the Colombian government's mid-August crackdown on suspected drug
traffickers.

   Bulgarian police Thursday detained at
least 25 environmental activists, beating and kicking some of them,
while they were campaigning against a government hydroelectric
project, Western sources in Sofia said.
   The sources, interviewed by telephone, said activists of the
independent Eco-Glasnost group were collecting signatures for
petitions opposing a plant in the Rila Mountains, about 75 miles
southwest of the Bulgarian capital. They were campaigning near an
international conference on Europe's environment.
   Twenty-five to 30 people were detained, including five members
of the group's governing body, the sources said, speaking on
condition of anonymity. The five were identified as group chairman
Petar Slabakov, Dejan Kiuranov, Alexander Karakachanov, Dimitrina
Petrova and Krasimir Kurnev.
   Kiuranov, Karakachanov and Mrs. Petrova were later released, the
sources said. However, the fate of the others detained was unknown.
   For 10 days, the activists have been permitted to campaign
publicly against plans to build a government-backed hydroelectric
plant in the Rila Mountains, about 75 miles southwest of Sofia.
   The petition drive coincided with the Oct. 16 opening of a
35-nation conference on the environment in Europe. The activists
were detained near Sofia's House of Culture, where the
international meetings were being held, the sources said.
   On Thursday, police told the group of about 25 activists to
board buses for another park on the outskirts of the city to
continue their signature camapign there, the sources said.
   The group refused and continued toward the central park. A small
van drove up, and about 10 plainclothes police jumped out and
forced six to nine people into the van, the sources said.
   They said the officers beat and dragged away those who resisted
by sitting down or refusing to move.
   The rest of the group, joined by a few more activists, reached
the park, but they were met there by uniformed police, the sources
said.
   The remaining activists were then herded into two more buses,
the sources said.
   They said at least 10 diplomats and delegates to the conference
witnessed the scene.
   Eco-Glasnost says it has collected 7,000 signatures from
opponents of the project.

<HEAD>Administration Willing To Compromise On Obscure Liquor Tax</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration said Thursday it would
not object if Congress forgives interest and penalties on an
obscure, 123-year-old liquor tax that has stirred up tavern owners,
grocers and fraternal groups.
   The administration stopped short of endorsing a waiver of
overdue taxes themselves.
   Protests over the tax have grown since a Pennsylvania Elks lodge
got a $9,776 bill last year for 50 years of non-payment, and a
California pizza shop owner got a $2,911 bill four weeks ago. Both
establishments said they never had heard of the so-called ``special
occupational tax'' on liquor retailers.
   About 600,000 beer, wine and distilled spirits dealers that sell
directly to the public must pay the annual tax, which was increased
in January 1988 from $54 to $250 per retailer. Accompanying the
increase has been a vigorous enforcement effort by the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
   The administration recognizes that the tax has created special
problems, Kenneth W. Gideon, assistant treasury secretary for tax
policy, said at a House Ways and Means subcommittee hearing.
   ``Although we continue to believe that taxpayer amnesty programs
are generally inappropriate, this case involves a tax that for
years before 1987 was insignificant and not well publicized,''
Gideon told the Subcommittee on Select Revenue Measures in a
prepared statement.
   ``It appears that noncompliance in years before 1987 was due to
the fact that many taxpayers were simply not aware of the tax,''
Gideon said. ``There is no evidence that dealers were attempting to
avoid the tax.''
   Before 1987, only about 40 percent of retailers were paying up,
Gideon said. He said the compliance rate is 80 percent now.
   A recent proposal by Rep. Ed Jenkins, D-Ga., to the Ways and
Means panel would forgive interest and penalties on the tax
accruing before last July.
   Rep. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., told the subcommittee Thursday that
it should also move to forgive tax debts on the books before 1985,
not just interest and penalties.
   That approach was backed by the National Restaurant Association.
   ``The great protest over this tax that you have heard recently
from constituents in the restaurant business grows from a feeling
that the federal government is unfair in penalizing honest
entrepreneurs for failure to pay a so-called `user fee' that the
IRS has never publicized or made any serious effort to collect in
the past 30 years,'' the lobbying group said.
   Gideon said the administration would balk at any proposal that
``resulted in the forgiveness of significant amounts of tax.''

   More than 1,200 Salvadorans who
fled their war-ravaged nation for camps in Honduras in the early
1980s returned home Thursday, U.N. officials said.
   The refugees crossed the border at El Poy, 45 miles north of San
Salvador, in a caravan of 34 buses and 148 trucks that carried
their belongings, said Werner Blatter, regional director for the
U.N. High Commission for Refugees.
   He said the refugees, who numbered 1,200 to 1,300, will resettle
in three northern towns that have been virtually abandoned since
the early 1980s because of civil war.
   The 10-year-old war is still being fought between a rightist
government and leftist guerrillas.
   However, the refugees, who had been living at Mesa Grande camp,
decided to try to rebuild their lives at home despite the conflict.
   About 12,000 Salvadorans remain in four camps in Honduras. Most
say they want to go home.
   Several more repatriation caravans of 1,000 to 1,500 people each
are planned for the coming months.
   With Thursday's group, more than 8,000 refugees have returned
since the program began in October 1987.

   A factory worker was executed Thursday for tax
evasion and black marketeering, bringing to more than 70 the number
of death sentences announced since mid-August.
   The convicts' crimes ranged from embezzlement to murder, and the
official press has not confirmed in all cases that the executions
have been carried out. However, death sentences are rarely
overturned on appeal.
   A count of cases publicized in national newspapers found 74
since Aug. 15, when the government began a new anti-corruption
campaign. Many more cases are reported only in local newspapers and
some are never reported, so the actual total may be much higher.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said the factory worker, Jian
Jianguo, 30, was sentenced and immediately executed in Beijing. It
said he evaded customs tariffs of more than $251,480 by forging
documents and official seals together with customs officers.
   He also made $148,090 in illegal profit by selling goods he
bought illegally in duty-free shops, Xinhua said.
   A second man who was convicted of embezzling $106,355 was
sentenced to death but then given a two-year reprieve, with the
chance for commutation to life in jail, because he confessed.
   The two cases clearly were publicized to encourage more people
to turn themselves in for economic crimes in the last five days of
a 10-week leniency period.
   The government said Aug. 15 that anyone turning himself in
before Oct. 31 for embezzlement, bribery and other economic crimes
would be treated less severely, while those _ like Jian _ who did
not would be sentenced harshly.
   By mid-October, more than 13,600 people nationwide had taken up
the offer. Many cities, including Beijing, have held public
meetings to parade the offenders.
   Not all of the 74 death sentences publicized since Aug. 15 were
for economic crimes.
   Five men were sentenced for holding up train passengers at
knife-point; two men for trafficking in the skins of rare giant
pandas; two men for abducting and selling mentally retarded women
as wives; and several for murder or theft.
   Chinese law gives judges wide discretion in sentencing, and the
death sentence can be given for almost any crime if the
circumstances are judged serious. The Supreme Court occasionally
hands down instructions to judges nationwide to treat certain
classes of criminals harshly, as in the Aug. 15 ultimatum and in a
June notice calling for severity in sentencing participants in the
spring democracy movement.
   There have been no new announcements of executions of
protesters. Twelve such cases were announced in the first weeks
after the army crushed the protests in June.
   Executions in China occur with a bullet to the back of the head.

   A top Soviet parliament member delivered a
letter Thursday to President Bush from Soviet President Mikail S.
Gorbachev offering an upbeat assessment of relations between
Washington and Moscow.
   Yevgeniy Primakov presented the three-page document, typewritten
in Russian, to Bush during a brief meeting in the Oval Office.
   Primakov, the top ranking official in the Supreme Soviet, is
leading a parliamentary delegation invited to the United States by
congressional leaders.
   Talking with reporters after the meeting, Primakov said Bush
``was quite warm when speaking about the changes that take place in
my country.''
   He said that Bush said that ``realistically-thinking politicians
understand full well that it is not only the Soviet Union but the
other countries, as well, need the success of perestroika (the
process of economic restructuring).''
   He declined to discuss Gorbachev's letter in detail but said it
``very positively evaluates the road that we have covered in the
improvement of our relations'' and suggests steps for further
improvements.
   ``That letter can cause the feelings of optimism,'' he said.

<HEAD>Bush May Not Meet With Israeli Prime Minister During U.S. Trip</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House raised the possibility
Thursday that President Bush might not meet next month with Israeli
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, even though Shamir requested such a
meeting.
   Shamir planned to visit the United States in mid-November.
   The administration was in the process of weighing
Israeli-suggested changes in Secretary of State James A. Baker
III's proposal for direct Israeli-Palestinian talks.
   But presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said there was
no link between this review and the question whether a Bush-Shamir
meeting would take place.
   Asked if the administration were trying to prod Israel by
hinting such a meeting might not take place, Fitzwater said: ``I
don't think so. I don't think a meeting is the kind of thing that's
going to influence Israel's position on these matters.''
   He told reporters that a meeting between the two leaders was
``probably likely.''
   But, later in the day his office issued a terse two-sentence
statement that said Shamir would be in the United States ``for a
private visit.''
   ``No decisions have been made concerning a possible meeting with
the president,'' it continued.
   It would be unusual for a U.S. president not to meet with an
Israeli prime minister visiting this country.
   ``We have asked for a meeting with President Bush and we're
still waiting for an answer,'' said Israel Embassy spokeswoman.
Ruth Yaron.
   Both U.S. and Israeli officials privately suggested that
scheduling problems were uppermost _ plus some confusion on the
exact dates of Shamir's visit.
   He was to speak to the General Assembly of the Zionist
Federation in Cincinnati on Nov. 16, but Israeli Embassy officials
said it was still not clear exactly when Shamir would arrive in the
country or how long he would stay.
   Shamir's government notified Baker on Monday night that it
accepted his proposal talks with Palestinians but only if two
conditions were met _ exclusion of the Palestine Liberation
Organization and limiting the meeting to making arrangments for an
election on the West Bank and in Gaza.
   Baker, in a White House news conference on Wednesday, said he
would review Israel's request that he revise his five-point
proposal. But he said he could not overhaul it because that would
touch off a long process of bargaining with both sides, delaying
the onset of the talks.

   Coal miners in the Soviet Far North defied the law
and struck Thursday but then returned to work. Miners, however,
threatened new walkouts in the Ukraine.
   A total of 18,000 workers in nine mines in the northern Vorkuta
region struck to demand the Kremlin make good on promised benefits,
a spokesman said.
   They decided to return to work at all but one mine after
hearings on the illegal strike began in regional court, said strike
committee member Sergei Masolovich.
   He said the walkout would continue at the Vorkuta region's
biggest coalfield, but that workers would return to the job Friday
at other mines.
   ``Due to pressure from the local media and management's taking
the case to court, the regional strike committee made a decision to
end the strike at midnight,'' Masolovich said by telephone.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in Finland on an official
visit, said Thursday that ``strong administrative measures through
the prosecutor and the court'' might be taken against the strikers
to promote stability.
   In the Ukraine's Donetsk coal basin, the country's largest
coal-producing area, miner representatives voted against
immediately resuming the strike that paralyzed the region this
summer, Soviet television reported.
   But they decided to hold a referendum to gauge miners' support
for a renewed walkout, the nightly news program ``Vremya'' said.
   In the western Ukrainian city of Lvov, about 5,000 people massed
Thursday evening and supported calls for a one-day general walkout
Friday in solidarity with miners and to push political demands, a
Ukrainian activist said.
   Top Soviet officials have voiced concern that strikes, by
cutting the nation's coal supplies, could force a rationing of heat
and light as the traditionally brutal Russian winter begins.
   The walkouts violated a law passed earlier this month by the
Soviet legislature that sets arbitration procedures for would-be
strikers and bans walkouts in such vital areas as energy, defense
and transportation.
   Strikes this summer in virtually all the Soviet Union's major
coalfields, from the Central Asia in the South to Vorkuta,
paralyzed much of the country's coal industry.
   The miners went back to work after the government promised to
meet their demands for better working conditions, improved supplies
of consumer goods and more financial independence.
   But Ukrainian miners' representatives claimed Thursday the
promises have not been kept.
   Alexei Bokharev, chairman of the Donetsk strike committee, said
in a telephone interview that the miners will decide Friday on a
course of action. ``Either the strike will be resumed or a
conciliation commission will be appointed,'' he said.
   Coal industry minister Mikhail Shchadov said in an interview
with Soviet television that the ministry is fulfilling all promises
to the miners.
   But Vremya also said conditions at many mines remain worse than
ever, and that they are producing far below capacity because of the
lack of needed spare parts and new technology.

<BYLINE>Insurers Don't See An Eruption in Quake Rates ^By STEVE WILSTEIN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Since sunrise the day after the big
earthquake, Fireman's Fund Insurance Co. has had claims adjusters
on the streets handing out checks for collapsed or burned homes.
   It was just like old times for the Novato, Calif.-based company.
   ``We made our reputation in the quake of 1906 when every other
San Francisco-based insurer went under,'' says spokesman John
Kozero. ``Our headquarters was destroyed and we had no records. But
we paid everyone, half cash and half stock, which in a few years
was worth more.''
   There's no problem for insurers in coming up with cash to pay
for the destruction of the Oct. 17 quake, and this time none are
expected to succumb to claims that could cost the industry $2
billion to $3 billion.
   Most insurers are scrambling to keep clients and win new ones by
responding quickly to claims, taking out ads in newspapers and
broadcasting commercials on radio.
   State Farm Insurance Co. flew in 250 claim handlers from around
the country to join 600 others working out of eight offices and
eight trailers.
   Despite more expensive costs and a year of calamities from coast
to coast, the insurers said Thursday they're not expecting soaring
rates as anticipated by Wall Street investors who bid up their
stocks after the big earthquake and Hurricane Hugo.
   Instead, the insurance companies said home owner rates and
earthquake riders in some damage-prone areas might go up a little
next year, others might go down and overall there won't be any
major changes.
   ``There should be no impact on personal home owners and
earthquake insurance,'' Kozero said. ``The rates were based on a
pattern of what happened in the past, and the quake was part of
what was expected.''
   If there is a rate hike, the companies said, it will more likely
affect commercial policies, which have benefited from a price war.
   Much of the estimated $4 billion for Hurrican Hugo and the
billions for the quake will be collected back from dozens of
reinsurers in Europe, Asia and the United States who assume part of
the liability of primary insurers.
   The quake is not going to bankrupt any insurance company, said
Gloria Vogel, industry analyst for Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. in New York.
``The industry does have the capital to pay out these enormous
losses and the risk is spread around the world.''
   The insurance companies also were buffered by 10 to 15 percent
deductibles on the expensive earthquake riders that make up for the
exclusion of quakes from home owners' policies. Because of that,
only about 20 percent of home owners carry earthquake insurance,
which by law must be offered in California.
   Insurers say there has been a small increase demand for
earthquake insurance since last week, just as there was after a
quake in Southern California a few years ago. But interest
typically dies down as memories of quakes fade.
   State Farm, the largest home and auto insurer in California and
the country, has $14 billion of home owners and earthquake policies
in force in the San Francisco Bay area and expects to pay out about
$300 million in quake claims.
   Unlike most insurers, State Farm will not collect much from
reinsurers.
   ``Because of our size, there's not enough reinsurance available
to make a significant impact on the amount of exposure we have,''
said Jim Stahly, spokesman for the Bloomington, Ill.-based company.
   State Farm, suffering its worst year in catastrophe claim
payments that include $500 million for Hurricane Hugo, will likely
have an underwriting loss for the year, Stahly said.
   So far, State Farm's adjusters and agents have processed about
7,500 quake claims _ about one-third of what it expects to handle.
   Fireman's Fund says its payout will be about $200 million, but
after reinsurance collection and taxes, the impact on its fourth
quarter will be no more than $50 million.
   The burden of at least half of Fireman's Fund's payouts will be
shared by 13 other insurance companies around the world, mostly in
London, West Germany, Switzerland, Italy and Japan.
   ``Often the reinsurers will reinsure again,'' said Kozero.
   Hurricane Hugo and the quake triggered a scramble among
insurance companies in London to make sure their reinsurance
protection was in place for the rest of the year.
   That increase in demand boosted reinsurance rates and eventually
could lead to higher primary rates, unless the primary companies
absorb the extra costs for competitive reasons.
   ``In the past two years many policies have been written under
cost because insurers are trying to win market share,'' said Kozero.
   ``Psychologically, this quake has a big effect on pricing,''
said Vogel. ``But it will be at least late 1990 before we see the
full effects of any price increases _ if they come.''
   Insurance stocks were attractive to investors before the quake
because of the perception interest rates may be coming down, she
said, but the rise in the past week ``may have been a little
overdone ... and we may see them backing off a little bit.''
   Insurance companies, especially those who handled reinsurance,
were the most popular plays on Wall Street after the quake. General
Re Corp. rose $2.75 to $86.50 the day after the quake and has
continue to climb this week week. Nac Re Corp., American
International Group and Cigna Corp. also were higher.
   ``The companies are not sounding as optimistic as investors are
that things are going to turn,'' Vogel said. ``But then again the
companies were the last ones to see price-cutting, too.''

<HEAD>Judge Refuses to Delay Woman's Sentence So She Can Have Abortion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW PORT RICHEY, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pregnant woman who asked to have
her 60-day jail sentence delayed so she could get an abortion was
refused by a judge who retorted, ``So you can murder your baby _ is
that it?''
   Pamela Forney, who began her third month of pregnancy this week,
asked for a 10-day delay before the start of her sentence for
violating probation on a 1987 conviction of driving under the
influence.
   She said she needed the time because she was scared that when
she got out of jail, it might be too late for a safe abortion.
   Even though attorneys for both prosecution and defense agreed,
Pasco County Judge Dan C. Rasmussen would have no part of it.
   ``Being pregnant is not going to keep you from doing this jail
time,'' the judge said Monday before sending the woman directly to
the West Pasco Detention Center.``You want a continuance so you can
murder your baby _ is that it?''
   A sobbing Ms. Forney pleaded with the judge, saying she is
financially unable to care for a baby. Rasmussen suggested she
carry it full term and then give it up for adoption.
   ``I thought it was my choice,'' Ms. Forney said in a jail
interview Tuesday. ``He's telling me I don't have a choice. It's
not right that he can choose for me.''
   The decision provoked criticism from the American Civil
Liberties Union, which moved Thursday to take over Ms. Forney's
defense.
   ``It's an outrage,'' said ACLU attorney Charlene Carres in
Tallahassee. ``Since when is the penalty for violating probation
for DUI a sentence of mandatory motherhood?''
   Ms. Forney, a 26-year-old, part-time bartender, doubts that
she'll have a job when she gets out of jail. She said she someday
wants children, but only when she can afford them.
   ``I don't want to have to go on welfare, and I would have to if
I have a baby,'' she said. ``I knew when you went to jail you gave
up some rights, but the rights over your own body?''
   In a statement, the judge said his personal views on abortion
had nothing to do with the sentence imposed.
   ``It was only after the sentence was approved by the court that
the defendant advised her attorney and the court of her
condition,'' Rasmussen said. He declined to comment further.
   ACLU attorneys were considering whether to file an action
contesting the sentence as cruel and unusual punishment, Ms. Carres
said.
   Ms. Forney was arrested in December 1987 on a DUI charge. In
1988, she was placed on probation, fined $250 and told to pay $100
in court costs and $175 in public defender fees. She also was to
perform 50 hours of community service.
   She just recently finished the community service, but paid only
$100 in her fines, court records show. Her probation violation
charge stemmed from her failure to pay.
   At Monday's hearing, the judge asked Ms. Forney why she had not
already had an abortion. She said she did not yet have the money.
Later, she said she had been saving money and this week's paycheck
would have given her enough.
   ``He could have given me two or three days,'' she said. ``It
doesn't take long. But now I may have to have a baby because the
judge doesn't believe in abortion.''

<HEAD>Federal Emphasis Switching to Fighting Child-Porn, Figures Suggest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal child pornography indictments are
soaring while obscenity charges for material involving adults are
declining, according to federal statistics that suggest the Justice
Department is focusing its anti-smut attack on material using
children.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh pledged to a religious audience
Thursday that the department will continue to fight pornography on
all fronts.
   However, he said in regard to material involving children,
``Pornography to me is degrading to human dignity in every form,
but it is most degrading to the human dignity of those who are
innocent and defenseless and who are preyed upon by criminal
actors.''
   The number of indictments for federal obscenity violations
dropped from 66 in 1987 to 37 last year, according to figures of
cases compiled by the Justice Department's National Obscenity
Enforcement Unit.
   The figures are incomplete because U.S. attorneys are not
required to report obscenity prosecutions to the Justice
Department, said Joseph Krovisky, a department spokesman.
   But during the same period, the number of federal
child-pornography prosecutions increased from 281 in 1987 to 406
last year, according to the unit's figures.
   FBI figures also reflect a decline in prosecutions involving
hard-core adult pornography. The number of ``open matters'' dropped
from 355 in 1987 to 302 in 1988 to 194 in the first nine months of
the 1989 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30.
   Thornburgh said the statistics don't reflect the length of
investigations, and he said the department would not ``abandon any
part of our across-the-board effort.''
   He also stressed that law enforcement officials considering
obscenity charges must be mindful of First Amendment protections
against censorship.
   ``We must be attentive to the preservation of First Amendment
rights just as we are attentive to the enforcement of laws that
attack those practices that lie outside the area of First Amendment
protection,'' the attorney general said.
   Critics of the obscenity unit, which was set up in 1987 by
Thornburgh's predecessor, Edwin Meese III, have charged that
prosecutions for obscenity violations trampled on constitutional
rights.
   Obscenity prosecutions involving adult pornography often involve
sensitive First Amendment questions that law enforcement officials
are not often eager to confront.
   In his speech to the Religious Alliance Against Pornography,
Thornburgh noted the difficulties making obscenity charges stick.
Eight obscenity counts against a Los Angeles pornographer were
dismissed by a judge who couldn't define a prevailing community
standard for obscenity, Thornburgh said.
   But the defendant, Rubin Gottesman, was convicted of a
child-pornography violation because the star of many of his videos
was a minor. Last week Gottesman was sentenced to a year in prison
and fined $100,000.
   Before Meese set up the obscenity unit, in response to
recommendations made by a commission he appointed to study
pornography, there were very few federal obscenity prosecutions,
said John Weston, a Los Angeles attorney who defends distributors
of X-rated material.
   Thornburgh said the department had virtually stamped out
mailings of sexually oriented advertising for X-rated videos and
other pornography. The department has obtained convictions of 11
individuals and 17 corporations since the so-called PostPorn
investigation began last year, he said.
   ``I'm sure you've noticed, as we have at Justice, a dramatic
decline in complaints,'' Thornburgh said. ``In most regions of the
country, those mailings simply don't go out anymore.''

<HEAD>Pardoned Labor Leaders Return Home to Santiago</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two leading labor activists Thursday
returned home to Santiago after 403 days of internal exile and
pledged to support the opposition candidate for president and to
fight for democracy.
   The union leaders, Manuel Bustos and Arturo Martinez, came back
to the capital after they were pardoned Monday by right-wing
military President Augusto Pinochet.
   ``We were punished for demanding justice, fair salaries for the
workers, and for defending the right to strike,'' Bustos said,
speaking to about 2,000 people who gathered at a Santiago suburb to
welcome them.
   ``It's the worker's right to strike which we have fought for,''
Martinez said.
   Bustos is president of the United Workers Central, and Martinez
is vice president of the group. They were sentenced to 541 days'
internal exile in provincial cities for calling a strike against
the government in 1987.
   The union officials said they will now actively support the
campaign of opposition presidential candidate Patricio Aylwin
because he has vowed to restore democracy to Chile after 16 years
of authoritarian military rule.
   Pinochet's pardon came the same week that Lech Walesa, leader of
Poland's Solidarity labor movement, was due to arrive in Chile to
visit both dissident leaders.
   Walesa canceled visits planned to Parral, 210 miles south of
Santiago, to see Bustos and to Chanaral, 595 miles north of the
capital, to see Martinez after hearing of the pardons.
   Pinochet was forced to call the presidential election, scheduled
for Dec. 14, after losing a public referendum last year on a
proposal to extend his rule to 1997.

   Congressional negotiators neared completion of
a $305 billion defense bill Thursday with lawmakers considering a
$1.1 billion cut in President Bush's Strategic Defense Initiative
and one less B-2 bomber in fiscal 1990.
   After nearly seven weeks of wrangling, House and Senate
conferees cited pressure from congressional leadership to adjourn
by Thanksgiving and the planned start on a defense spending bill by
the appropriations committees next week as the reasons for the push
to finish.
   ``It's coming together,'' said Rep. John Rowland, R-Conn., a
member of the House Armed Services Committee.
   Late Thursday, House and Senate conferees on procurement and
research and development met separately to mull over the latest
proposals, including the following:
   _Approximately $255 million for research and development of the
Marine Corps' V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft, but no procurement
money. The future of the program would be tied to commercial use of
the V-22, said lawmakers and congressional sources, who requested
anonymity.
   _A plan to purchase 18 of the Navy's F-14D Tomcat jet fighters
in fiscal 1990 but none in fiscal 1991.
   Bush has proposed canceling the two conventional programs,
decisions that met with strong opposition on Capitol Hill.
   _About $950 million for the National Guard and reserves. The
House bill had earmarked $1.2 billion for the guard and reserves.
   Lawmakers ruled out a final agreement on the defense bill by
week's end, but said a resolution was possible sometime next week.
   Among the other compromises still being considered between the
two widely divergent House and Senate blueprints for the fiscal
year that began Oct. 1:
   _A Pentagon total of $3.55 billion for SDI, popularly known as
Star Wars, according to Rep. William Dickinson of Alabama, ranking
Republican on the House Armed Services panel.
   The total represents a $1.1 billion cut in Bush's request and is
about $200 million less than the amount spent in fiscal 1989. The
compromise is a split between the $2.8 billion approved by the
House and $4.3 billion the Senate adopted, but does not include
about $250 million in Department of Energy money and military
construction dollars.
   ``This is the first time it will take a real hit,'' said
Rowland, who indicated that strategic programs are suffering at the
hands of conventional programs that translate into jobs in
lawmakers' home districts.
   _Approximately $1.2 billion for the MX multiple-warhead,
rail-based missile and the Midgetman single-warhead, truck-based
missile, which is equivalent to the $1.1 billion Bush proposed for
the MX and $100 million for the Midgetman, Dickinson said.
   However, the proposal requires Cheney to cut $100 million from
the $1.2 billion and gives him the discretion on how to spend the
amount remaining. Cheney had favored funding only the MX missile,
but Bush opted for the two land-based nuclear missiles.
   The proposal also includes House language imposing a 50-missile
cap on the MX, the total number of the missiles currently in fixed
silos.
   Lawmakers and congressional sources who spoke on condition of
anonymity said the other proposals being consider include money to
buy two stealth bombers in fiscal 1990 and parts for five in fiscal
1991.
   The Bush administration had sought funds to buy three of the
bat-winged aircraft in fiscal 1990 and components for five in
fiscal 1991.

<HEAD>House Seeks Compromise on Minimum Wage Increase</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Republicans and conservative Democrats
who sustained President Bush's veto in June of a minimum wage
increase struggled Thursday to find a compromise that would avoid
another showdown next week.
   But the White House, in a meeting with leaders of the two
parties, refused to budge on Bush's demand for a six-month
subminimum training wage and labor leaders balked at accepting
anything less than a $4.25 minimum wage by January 1991.
   Whether a compromise is reached or not, Democratic leaders plan
to bring to the House floor next Wednesday a scaled-back $4.25
version of the bill that Bush vetoed, which would have set a
$4.55-an-hour minimum wage with a 60-day subminimum training wage.
   Key players in both parties and lobbyists for business and labor
groups said the White House has been sending signals since late
last week that Bush wanted to avoid a showdown and was open to
negotiating a deal.
   ``There is a lot of nervousness on the part of the White House
that they could look like a mean old ogre here fighting day and
night to get a capital gains tax break while also fighting equally
hard against raising the minimum wage,'' said Rep. Timothy J.
Penny, D-Minn.
   ``They want to come in at the last minute and make a deal but
there's no firm decision on what they want,'' said Penny, one of 28
Democrats who voted last summer to sustain Bush's veto.
   Despite pleas from Democrats like Penny and several Republicans,
White House Chief of Staff John Sununu told House Speaker Thomas S.
Foley, D-Wash., and GOP leader Robert H. Michel of Illinois that
Bush would not yield.
   ``We didn't reach agreement on anything,'' Foley told reporters
after the White House meeting.
   Bush, in what he called a ``best and only offer,'' promised
shortly after taking office to veto any bill that would raise the
minimum wage above $4.25 an hour or that reached that level before
Jan. 1, 1992.
   Coupled with any increase, he said, must be a six-month
subminimum training wage that would maintain the current wage floor
of $3.35 an hour for newly hired workers, regardless of their
experience.
   Sununu, according to congressional sources and lobbyists,
``floated'' as a possible compromise gradually increasing the wage
floor to $4.25 an hour by July 1991 _ six months earlier than Bush
wanted _ with a three-month subminimum for new hires.
   But that offer was not put forth Thursday, Foley and Michel said.
   ``The president will have to bend a little bit'' to avoid a veto
fight, Michel said, ``and there may be room for some bending. I
don't think the president would enjoy vetoing a second minimum wage
bill.''
   Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., said supporters still lack a
two-thirds, veto-proof majority for a new bill that would raise the
wage floor to $3.80 this January and to $4.25 by January 1991 with
a 60-day training wage only for first-time workers.
   ``But we're gaining ground,'' he said. ``Our whip count from
Republicans and conservative Democrats is much better than it was
the last vote.''
   Democrats want to have a bill approved by both the House and
Senate and on Bush's desk before the Nov. 13 arrival in Washington
of Polish Solidarity union leader Lech Walesa, believing the
occasion will make a veto more difficult politically.
   ``We want to get it to him and give him an opportunity to think
about it,'' said Bonior. ``The priorities of this administration in
terms of economic justice for people are nowhere near reality.''
   Robert McGlotten, the AFL-CIO's chief lobbyist, expressed a
willingness to negotiate the training wage issue as long as there
are assurances that employers cannot use it to rotate workers in
and out of entry-level jobs so that they never rise above the
subminimum level.
   ``They keep talking like they want to make some movement,'' he
said of the administration, ``but when we sit down with them, we
get nowhere. They're floundering all over the place.''
   McGlotten said ``there's no give'' by unions on the issue of
achieving a 90-cent increase to $4.25 an hour by January 1991.

   Authorities found a man's body buried in
a shallow grave in a barn under tons of hay, the fourth such
discovery in a 2{-week-old search for missing drifters who worked
with a farmer.
   The body, wrapped in plastic and clad in boots and a heavy coat,
was found Wednesday evening, officials and another farmer said.
Authorities continued to move large bales of hay and dig in the
barn Thursday.
   ``We're about half done,'' said Greg Coon of the nine-county
North Central Missouri Major Case Squad.
   The search began Oct. 9, when Ray Copeland, 75, and his
68-year-old wife, Faye, were arrested in an alleged cattle swindle.
They are being held in the Livingston County Jail here on $25,000
bond each on charges of conspiracy to steal.
   Law enforcement officials, using backhoes, shovels and
bloodhounds, first searched Copeland's farm near Mooresville about
10 miles southwest of here, then moved to other farms where
Copeland had worked in the Chillicothe area, about 90 miles
northeast of Kansas City.
   The fourth body, which has not been identified, was found on Joe
Roy Adams' farm 12 miles south of Copeland's farm and three miles
northeast of Neil Bryan's farm, where the other three bodies were
found Oct. 16.
   The three found at Bran's farm had been shot in the head and
buried in shallow graves in a barn. They have not been identified,
but appeared to be 20 to 32 years old. The cause of the fourth
man's death has not been determined.
   No one has been charged in the four men's deaths and the
Copelands have not been named as suspects. But authorities have
said they are looking for less than a dozen transients who may have
stayed with the Copelands.
   Adams, owner for 3{ years of the farm where the body was found
Wednesday, said Copeland had managed the farm for previous owner
Ted Lock. Adams said Copeland kept some of his hay in the barn for
about a year after the sale, and occasionally traveled there.
   ``He worked here for about 10 years,'' said Adams, 62. ``He was
in and out all the time. ... Copeland never worked for me at all.
He wanted to, but I didn't hire him.''
   ``We just thought he was a good, hard-working man trying to make
ends meet,'' recalled Lock's wife, Charlotte.
   Adams said the body was under small, square bales of hay that
had been stacked in the barn while Copeland still worked at the
farm and some large, round bales that Adams had added.
   There were about 800 of the large bales and more than 1,000 of
the smaller ones in the barn before officers began moving them.

<HEAD>Christian Leaders Condemn Tax Raids; Troops Kill Two Palestinians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN ALT POWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leaders of four major Christian
denominations in Jerusalem Thursday condemned Israeli tax raids on
a nearby Christian-Arab town and pledged food donations and prayers.
   Israeli security forces shot and killed two Palestinian youths
in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, and masked Arabs stabbed
to death a Palestinian nurse suspected of collaborating with
Israeli authorities.
   The latest deaths raised to 605 the number of Palestinians
killed by Israelis in the 22-month-old uprising against Israeli
rule of the occupied lands. Another 136 Palestinians have been
killed by fellow Arabs, most on suspicion of collaborating with
Israel. Forty Israelis also have died.
   The army announced Thursday that security forces uncovered two
``terrorist cells'' in the West Bank connected to Yasser Arafat's
Fatah faction of the PLO, including one that injured two Israeli
soldiers in firebomb attacks in Nablus.
   An army spokesman said those captured confessed to belonging to
Fatah during interrogation, but he refused to give further
information.
   The church leaders said in a statement that five weeks of tax
raids on the West Bank town of Beit Sahour were ``causing undue
suffering to the population.''
   The town of about 10,000 has been a hotbed of anti-Israeli
resistance during the Palestinian uprising and many there have
participated in the tax boycott called by uprising leaders.
   The statement on Beit Sahour was issued by the Greek Orthodox,
Roman Catholic and Armenian patriarchs and by the Franciscan
``custodian of the Holy Land.''
   They called for special prayer services Sunday and said they
would send food supplies and ``follow up the situation with all
appropriate means.'' They did not elaborate.
   A Palestinian-run human rights group charged that the tax raids
were aimed at intimidating Beit Sahour residents and often resulted
in the illegal seizure of property.
   Al Haq-Law in the Service of Man provided five case studies,
including alleged army confiscation of furniture from a family that
owed no taxes and the ransacking of a grocery store. Al Haq is
affiliated with the International Commission of Jurists in Geneva.
   Israeli newspapers have estimated more than $1 million worth of
furniture, machinery and merchandise has been confiscated in raids
in Beit Sahour since Sept. 20. Israeli officials say the property
will be sold to recover revenue.
   Olivier Rafowicz, spokesman for the military government in the
West Bank, said he could not comment on specific cases raised by Al
Haq because he had not seen the report.
   But he said that ``from the beginning it was a totally legally
based operation.'' He said residents who felt they were wronged
could appeal to the Israeli Supreme Court, but that no one in Beit
Sahour has done so.
   In violence related to the uprising, Israeli security forces
shot and killed two Palestinian youths, including 18-year-old Naeem
Karim Daamseh of the West Bank town of Bethlehem.
   The army said troops fired on Daamseh's car after he ran a
military roadblock and intentionally ran into a policeman. It said
the officer was hospitalized with minor injuries.
   In the Gaza Strip's Jabaliya refugee camp, 19-year-old Adel Abu
Salem was fatally shot by soldiers who fired on masked youths who
ignored calls to halt, the army said.
   Arab reporters said the soldiers suprised youths painting
anti-Israeli slogans by arriving in a civilian Mercedes car and out
of uniform. The army statement did not mention soldiers being in
civilian dress.
   In the Gaza Strip, five masked Palestinians entered Nasser
Hospital in the town of Khan Yunis and fatally stabbed a nurse,
Arab reports said. She was identified as Sawsan Al-Hussein, 25.
   The attackers scrawled on a hospital wall that she was
collaborating with Israel. The army confirmed the death and said
police were investigating.

<HEAD>Bush Questions Constitutionality of New Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said Thursday he has ``serious
doubts'' about the constitutionality of a law that takes effect
Saturday to outlaw the desecration of the American flag.
   In a written statement, Bush reiterated his belief that a
constitutional amendment is the only way to ensure that the flag is
protected.
   The law, which will take effect at one minute after midnight
Friday, provides a prison term of up to a year for anyone who
``knowingly mutilates, defaces, physically defiles, burns,
maintains on the floor or ground or tramples upon'' any U.S. flag.
   ``While I commend the intentions of those who voted for this
bill, I have serious doubts that it can withstand Supreme Court
review,'' Bush said.
   He said the Supreme Court has held ``that the government's
interest in preserving the flag as a symbol can never be compelling
enough to justify prohibiting flag desecration that is intended to

bill's prohibition, I suspect that any subsequent court challenge
will reach a similar conclusion.''

   Rain and snow fell Thursday in the Pacific Northwest, while much
of the East Coast basked in the sun.
   Showers produced three-quarters of an inch of rain at Astoria,
Ore., and snow fell over some of the higher elevations of
Washington and Oregon.
   A snow advisory was posted for Thursday night in the mountains
of southeastern Idaho.
   Sunny skies prevailed across most of the rest of the eastern
half of the nation.
   Snow and blowing snow advisories continued in effect for the
northern and central mountains of Colorado and Wyoming. High wind
watches also were posted, and up to 8 inches of snow were expected
overnight.
   A cold front crossing the central United States was beginning to
produce showers and thunderstorms in the northern and central
Plains. Strong thunderstorms were developing across parts of
Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska and the Dakotas.
   Showers and thunderstorms were again over south-central Texas
and along the southern Atlantic coast.
   Sunny skies prevailed across most of the rest of the eastern
half of the nation after an early-morning fog descended on parts of
New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan.
   Afternoon temperatures climbed into the 70s east of the Rockies,
in northern Minnesota and the upper Great Lakes, while highs in the
80s were reported in southern Texas and southern Florida.
   Readings were only in the 30s and 40s in Montana, Wyoming and
Colorado.

<HEAD>Brady Calls for SEC Market-Halting Power; SEC Chairman Resists</HEAD>

   Treasury Secretary Nicholas S. Brady said
Thursday that the Securities and Exchange Commission should have
the power to halt stock trading in market emergencies.
   Brady noted that SEC Chairman Richard C. Breeden said just a day
earlier that he doesn't want such authority.
   But the treasury secretary said the Bush administration backs
bills in Congress to strengthen the SEC in the belief that
government's initial response to market emergencies should come
``from a regulator with expertise and proximity to the markets.''
   Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee in support of the
legislation, Brady, who headed a government commission that
investigated Wall Street's 1987 crash, said the 190-point slide in
the Dow Jones industrial average on Oct. 13 had not altered his
belief in the soundness of the U.S. economy.
   But he said the ``tailspin'' did point up the need for changes
in market regulation.
   He supported legislation introduced by Sens. Christopher Dodd,
D-Conn., and John Heinz, R-Pa., to give the SEC emergency powers to
restrict or halt trading, a power vested now only in the president.
   Brady, in a letter accompanying his testimony, noted that the
legislation would give the president power to terminate SEC
emergency actions and would require presidential approval for any
trading halt lasting longer than 24 hours.
   He said the administration supports other provisions of the
legislation to:
   _Give the SEC authority to request reports on large securities
and options trades.
   _Set rules for regulators to use in assessing the financial
soundness of the parent holding companies of brokerage houses.
   _Provide for improved coordination in the clearing and settling
of market transactions.
   Legislation making the same changes, but with minor variations,
is also before the House.
   On Wednesday, Breeden told a House panel he supports the
legislation except for the provision giving the SEC the power to
halt trading in emergencies.
   Breeden said that safety mechanisms called circuit-breakers _
temporary automatic trading halts in times of market volatility _
have eliminated much of the need for officials to order trading
stopped.
   The SEC chairman said he also believes the possibility of
arbitrary halts could cause uncertainty and volatility in the
markets.
   Late in the day, Breeden said through a spokeswoman that he
would have no comment on Brady's testimony.
   The Brady commission, in a January 1988 report on the stock
market crash of the previous October, recommended that ``one agency
should coordinate'' all the financial markets. The recommendation
was not acted upon by the Reagan administration.
   But the treasury secretary said Thursday that, given the nature
of the various market regulators _ the SEC, the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission and the Federal Reserve Board _ ``I don't
believe that's a practical possibility.''
   ``Maybe that was something written naively by somebody outside
the government,'' Brady conceded. Noting that the report was issued
``some 60 days'' after the crash, he said, ``Perhaps we overreacted
to some extent.''
   Brady was non-committal about program trading, in which millions
of shares of stocks are traded almost instantaneously by
computerized systems used mainly by huge indstitutional investors
such as banks, mutual funds and pension funds.
   ``I don't have a view as to whether we ought to do anything
about program trading,'' Brady told Sen. Timothy E. Wirth, D-Colo..

<TEXT>
   The Senate voted Thursday 65-35 to approve
legislation that would create a commission to investigate the
Eastern Airlines strike, after debate in which Democrats challenged
President Bush's lack of efforts to settle the 8-month-old dispute.
   Thursday's vote followed a narrow Democratic vote earlier this
month to close debate on the bill.
   Fifty-five Democrats voted for the measure and none against. Ten
Republicans also supported it.
   The House already has passed a similar legislation and the House
and Senate will have to work out differences in the bills.
   Republicans had been delaying since shortly after the strike
began March 4. President Bush has refused to appoint an emergency
board, under provisions of the Railway Labor Act, to investigate
the strike.
   That refusal led to Democratic criticism Thursday of Bush's
handling of the strike. Some 30,000 machinists, flight attendants
and pilots have been out of work as a result.
   ``Mr. President, nobody is asking you to come down on the side
of the workers, the strikers,'' said Sen. Howard Metzenbaum,
D-Ohio. ``Nobody is asking you to come down on the side of
management.''
   Metzenbaum cited 34 previous occasions under which Democratic
and Republican presidents have appointed emergency boards, causing
settlement of 26 strikes without a work stoppage.
   ``But for some reason that I don't understand, this president is
reluctant to provide some leadership in bringing about a settlement
of the case,'' Metzenbaum said.
   Bush has said management and employees should resolve the
problem.
   Under the bill, a Democrat and a Republican from the House and
one each from the Senate would be appointed by their respective
leaders in Congress to the commission.
   The panel would make recommendations on how to settle the strike
and make further recommendations on maintaining competiveness in
the airline industry. The panel also would make recommendations on
how to protect employee collective bargaining rights in bankruptcy
proceedings involving air carriers.
   The report will be due in 45 days after enactment.
   Five days after the Eastern strike began, the company filed for
protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Act. Eastern has been
continuing efforts to reorganize in bankruptcy court and the
airline has said it plans to emerge as a carrier two-thirds its
former size.
   Eastern was purchased by Frank Lorenzo in 1986, and he has been
accused by strikers and Senate Democrats of siphoning away
Eastern's cash and assets. He has been criticized for allegedly
draining the assets of other airlines as well.
   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland said: ``We are delighted that
the Senate has approved this labor-supported proposal, which
provides a process that should lead to a fair and equitable
settlement of the Eastern Air Line strike. We urge the House accept
the Senate bill and the president to quickly sign it into law.''

   Charles J. Pedersen, co-winner of the 1987
Nobel Prize in chemistry for his discovery of molecules that enable
scientists to create complex organic compounds, died Thursday
following a lengthy illness. He was 85.
   Pedersen, who lived alone, died around 9:30 a.m. in his Salem
home, said Justin Carisio, a spokesman for Pedersen's former
employer, E.I. Du Pont Nemours and Co. He had suffered from a form
of blood cancer and Parkinson's disease, Carisio said.
   His body was discovered by his housekeeper, Carisio said.
   Pedersen was awarded the Nobel prize in October 1987, sharing
the $360,000 award with California researcher Donald J. Cram and
French scientist Jean-Marie Lehn for their work in the syntheses of
crown ether molecules.
   Pedersen was cited for his pioneering work nearly 25 years
previously in discovering crown ethers, molecules that make it
possible to synthesize numerous complex organic compounds that
imitate the behavior of natural proteins.
   Scientists have said crown ethers could lead to the development
of radioactivity antidotes, new pharmaceutical delivery systems and
extractors of gold and uranium from the sea.
   ``He was a brilliant chemist and an extraordinary gentleman,''
Du Pont Chairman Edgar S. Woolard Jr. said in a statment. ``After
winning the prize, he inspired everyone else with his dignity, his
humility and his personal charm.''
   In an interview after receiving the prize, Pedersen said, ``I
was very excited. That's all I can remember about how I felt.''
   Pedersen was one of the few Nobel winners in the sciences who
had never earned a doctorate or a professorship. His highest
academic degree was a masters from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
   A self-described ``hands-on'' industrial chemist, Pedersen spent
his 42-year career at Du Pont in New Jersey and Delaware, where his
research yielded 65 patents, mostly in petrochemicals.
   Early in his career, he contributed to the development of
Neoprene, the first commercially successful synthetic rubber.
   ``He was a real example of a complete professional, a
well-rounded man who had a wide variety of interests,'' said
Raymond Fitz, president of the University of Dayton. Pedersen was a
1926 graduate of the University of Dayton.
   ``Not only was he a great scientist, but he also loved poetry
and the outdoors,'' Fitz said. ``We're deeply saddened by his
death.''
   Pedersen was born in Korea of a Norwegian father and a Japanese
mother. He moved to the United States when he was 17.
   He began working in the Du Pont laboratories in Deepwater in
1927 and transferred to the company's laboratory in Wilmington,
Del., where he remained until his retirement in 1969.
   Pedersen is survived by two daughters, Shirley Evans of Salem,
N.J., and Barbara Cleaveland of Alexandria, Va.; four
grandchildren; and three great grandchildren.

<HEAD>Americans, Soviets to Open Chemical Weapons Talks Next Week</HEAD>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet and American officials said
Thursday they will meet next week to negotiate cuts in chemical
arms, and the Soviets challenged Washington's decision to make
shells for some of those weapons.
   It will be the first round of talks between the two nations
since President Bush and Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
unveiled competing proposals to reduce chemical weapons last month
in U.N. General Assembly speeches.
   The U.S.-Soviet talks are intended to lead to a superpower
treaty banning all poison gas and to spur a 40-nation conference in
Geneva to ban all chemical weapons.
   Seven days of talks will begin Monday in New York, said U.S. and
Soviet officials. Max Friedersdorf will lead the U.S. delegation.
   In his U.N. speech, Bush offered to cut U.S. chemical weapon
stockpiles by 80 percent if the Soviets reduce their arsenal by the
same amount.
   A day later, Shevardnadze said the superpowers should go still
further. He challenged Washington to agree to stop making all
poison gas, including so-called binary weapons.
   Such weapons are activated by combining two chemicals.
   Congress has approved funds to continue production of binary
poison gas bombs and shells. Bush administration officials have
confirmed they intend to continue producing shells even after a
treaty is signed.
   The Soviets said they would raise that point on Monday.
   The chief Soviet delegate to the talks, Sergei Batsanov, said:
``From a practical point of view, it could be called nonsense if
you start destroying your chemical weapons under an agreement and
at the same time you start producing new chemical weapons.''
   Washington contends Moscow has far greater stockpiles of poison
gas than the United States. The Soviets say they have 50,000 tons,
compared with an estimated 30,000 tons for the United States.
   Bush proposed a U.S.-Soviet agreement to begin cuts at once
while an international treaty is worked out in which the United
States would destroy 98 percent of its chemical weapons over eight
years.
   The remaining 2 percent would be destroyed within 10 years if
all nations capable of building such weapons agreed to a total ban.
   The U.S. and Soviet negotiators will be working on the basis of
a memorandum of understanding signed by Secretary of State James A.
Baker III and Shevardnadze during September talks in Wyoming.
   The memorandum calls for inspections and even surprise visits by
each side to verify agreements.

<HEAD>Plant Fire Most Serious Spanish Nuclear Accident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A power plant fire a week ago was Spain's
worst nuclear accident since it introduced nuclear power in 1968,
but no radiation was leaked, the national Nuclear Safety Commission
said Thursday.
   A preliminary report by the commission said the fire at the
Vandellos I plant on the Mediterranean coast probably began when
excessive shaft vibration caused failure of a mount holding one of
the two turbine generators.
   No radiation was leaked during or after the accident and there
was no radiation risk to firemen, plant personnel or the public,
the report said.
   The plant, one of seven in Spain, went into service in 1972 at
Vandellos, a coastal town in Tarragona Province 90 miles south of
Barcelona, Spain's second-largest city.
   Although the accident caused no injuries, it prompted local and
national concern about plant safety and evacuation plans. The
commission said preliminary results of its investigation indicated
plant personnel acted correctly.
   Its report said vibration of the turbine shaft created a leak of
lubrication oil and damaged an attached electric generator, which
leaked hydrogen used to cool the generator.
   Contact between the hydrogen and oxygen in the air started the
fire, which fed on the leaking oil and spread through the
electrical production area below the turbines and next to the
concrete structure housing the nuclear reactor, the report said.
The reactor is a gas-cooled unit of French design.
   According to the commission, the fire began at 9:39 p.m Oct. 19
and was brought under control by plant and area firemen at 1:30
a.m. Oct. 20, but was not extinguished entirely until 3 a.m.
   The vibration also ruptured a pipeline carrying sea water to the
condenser in the turbine area, the commission reported. It said
water washed across the floor below the turbines and eventually
leaked into the basement area of the steel-and-concrete containment
structure around the reactor, affecting ``numerous plant systems.''
   It said the fire and flooding shut down two of the four
water-cooled pumps that propel cooling gas to the reactor, but said
the two remaining were enough to cool the reactor.
   ``The actions taken permitted the overcoming of the critical
situation provoked by the precariousness of the plant following the
fire and flooding,'' the report said.
   ``At this time any statement on the future of the plant would be
premature,'' the report said. The commission said it was preparing
a technical report on the circumstances and consequences of the
accident for the government.
   A consortium of the French utility Electricite de France and
several Spanish companies owns the plant, which has a cold-gas
reactor using natural uranium.

   Two gunmen killed a British
soldier and his 6-month-old daughter near a Royal Air Force base
Thursday, officials said.
   British military authorities said the soldier's wife was driving
the family car at the time of the attack and was taken to a local
hospital in shock.
   ``As far as we know she was not otherwise hurt,'' a British Army
of the Rhine spokeswoman said in a telephone interview from
Moenchengladbach.
   Local police had said earlier the woman had been injured in the
attack near the Royal Air Force base at Wildenrath, close to the
border with The Netherlands.
   Hans-Juergen Foerster, spokesman for the federal prosecutor's
office in Karlsruhe, said authorities were ``pretty certain that
the attackers belong to the Irish Republican Army.''
   No one claimed responsibility, but the IRA has made similar
attacks on British soldiers in recent months.
   The British spokeswoman, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
identified the slain soldier as Royal Air Force Cpl. Maheshkumar
Islania, 34, whose parents live in London.
   The British army spokeswoman said the assailants opened fire
with automatic weapons as the family drove away from a gasoline
station that also has a fast-food bar.
   Foerster said the gunmen drove off in a van toward the Dutch
border.
   Tom King, the British defense secretary, expressed shock at
``this vicious murder.'' He said British military officials were
working closely with West German authorities on the investigation.
   Wildenrath is one of Britain's main air bases in West Germany.
   The Irish Republic Army, outlawed in Britain and Ireland,
claimed responsibility for the killing a British soldier's wife
Sept. 7 outside Dortmund. It said the woman, a West German, was
shot in the mistaken belief she was a British soldier.
   Since June, two car bombs have exploded in British military
housing areas in West Germany and one soldier was killed in an
attack in Hanover. A third bomb planted in a soldier's car was
found Aug. 28 and defused.
   The IRA, which seeks to drive the British from Northern Ireland
and unite the province with the Irish Republic, claimed
responsibility for the fatal attack and police suspect it in the
others.
   More than 66,000 British soldiers and their dependents are in
West Germany.

   Drug agents staged dozens of raids nationwide
Thursday, arresting 119 people on charges of growing marijuana
indoors or selling equipment for it and seizing 65 indoor groves,
the Drug Enforcement Administration said.
   In addition, the agents raided 22 stores that sell the equipment
for the indoor marijuana growing, seizing and boarding up seven or
eight of them, said DEA spokesman Frank Shults, who provided the
figures as of early evening for the raids in Operation Green
Merchant.
   The DEA planned to raid a total of 65 commercial businesses in
22 states as well as more than 100 indoor cultivation locations in
46 states on Thursday. The raids continued into the night.
   A marijuana legalization advocate said the raids were just ``a
publicity stunt.''
   A law enforcement source, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said earlier in the day that federal agents had expected to make
only 100 arrests Thursday. In the previous month, 112 people had
been arrested in connection with the same investigation.
   The stores raided ``range from mom-and-pop to something
equivalent to a K-mart,'' said the source.
   ``We have established through the advertising and other means
that these stores do sell the indoor cultivation apparatus and give
advice about its use for the cultivation of marijuana,'' Shults
said. ``They openly do it.''
   The DEA used undercover agents in every store to determine
whether the owners knew the equipment _ such as lighting,
irrigation and ventilation apparatus _ was being used for indoor
marijuana cultivation, the source said.
   The stores were located in Alaska, Arizona, California,
Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan,
Minnesota, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma,
Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, Washington
and Wisconsin.
   The only four states where no raids were planned on indoor
cultivation sites were Hawaii, Nebraska, North Dakota and West
Virginia.
   Doug McVay of the National Organization for the Reform of
Marijuana Laws, said the raids on stores were ``a publicity stunt,
a largely ineffective one,'' and ``silly, really silly.''
   ``I can understand the DEA's frustration,'' McVay said. ``It's
true, some of this equipment is being used for (indoor marijuana)
cultivation. On the other hand, dirt is used for indoor
cultivation. I don't think we're going to stop people from selling
dirt.''
   An increasing number of U.S. marijuana growers have been moving
their plants indoors because of extensive aerial surveillance that
enables officials to spot drugs grown outside.
   In the past month, 112 people have been arrested on charges of
cultivating marijuana at 94 indoor growing locations containing
17,000 sinsemilla marijuana plants, according to Shults.
   ``We are trying to send the message to all those people in the
United States who have been cultivating marijuana that they are
violating the law, they will be caught, they will be prosecuted
and, if found guilty, they will serve time,'' said Shults.
   The raided stores ``specialize in the sale of these otherwise
legitimate products with the knowledge that they will be used to
cultivate marijuana,'' he said.
   A DEA statement said the agency has obtained ``the names and
addresses of thousands of individuals who are suspected of being
involved in the indoor cultivation of marijuana.''
   Steve Hager, editor of High Times magazine, said he believed
federal drug agents had subpoenaed the United Parcel Service
shipping records of the publication's advertisers ``and have been
using that information to build a conspiracy case of some kind.''
   ``I've been told that by people who have been visited by the
DEA,'' Hager said. ``They were told they (the agents) got their
names from UPS.''
   However, UPS spokesman Al Winnik said, ``There's no word here of
any subpoenas by DEA ... or any agency of that type.''
   The DEA would not comment except to say there was still an
``ongoing investigation.''
   McVay noted that legitimate manufacturers sell such items as
lights used for growing plants indoors and kits of indoor gardening
equipment, and that they can be bought at hardware stores.
   Shults said such companies were not targeted by the DEA, which
carried out the raids in coordination with state and local
officials.
   Domestic suppliers produce about 25 percent of the marijuana
consumed in the United States, while Colombia produces about 40
percent, Mexico 25 percent and other countries 10 percent,
according to government estimates.
   The DEA estimated that domestic production increased from 2,100
tons in 1986 to 4,350 to 4,850 tons in 1988. The National Drug
Control Strategy announced by President Bush in September called
for increasing federal funds for domestic marijuana eradication
from $8 million in fiscal 1989 to $16 million in the 1990 fiscal
year.
   A pound of sinsemilla _ the highly potent form of marijuana that
accounted for about 53 percent of the domestically eradicated
cannibis in 1988 _ costs $2,000 to $4,000, McVay said.

<TEXT>
   President Bush's ``honeymoon'' with Congress
ended a long time ago, his spokesman suggested Thursday.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush still
hopes to reach bipartisan agreements with the Democratic-controlled
House and Senate, even though relations have been frayed lately.
   At his daily news briefing, Fitzwater was asked whether Bush's
honeymoon with Congress was over _ given recent bitter battles with
Democrats on abortion financing, the capital gains tax and other
issues.
   ``Oh, I think the honeymoon's been over a long time,'' Fitzwater
said. ``But I don't think it means that we abandon or even diminish
our plea for bipartisanship.''
   For one thing, Fitzwater said, ``We are still the minority
party. We still believe we have to work with the leadership and
with the Congress to get legislation passed.''
   ``There are going to be battles and we are going to enjoin
them,'' he said.

   The government Thursday ordered the
local office of United Press International closed and gave its
foreign correspondents 72 hours to leave the country.
   An order from the government and Justice Ministry delivered to
the UPI office said the U.S. news agency ``has systematically
violated journalistic ethics by the publication of false news with
the evident intention of discrediting the authorities of the
Republic of Panama and damaging the image of its leaders.''
   ``Despite (having this) called to its attention frequently,
United Press International (UPI) has not varied its conduct, and on
the contrary has accentuated its hostility to the national cause of
the people and government of Panama,'' the order said.
   Milt Capps, senior UPI vice president for corporate affairs,
said in Washington: ``The Panamanian government has in a written
communique to us today indicated they expect one of our staffers to
leave the country in the near future. We right now are pursuing
every avenue to contact government officials to attempt to resolve
this matter.
   ``We're confident that we will be able to continue to report
from Panama objectively and fully.''
   The government order canceled the registration of UPI
correspondents in Panama and gave its foreign personnel 72 hours to
leave the country.
   Chief correspondent Tomas Cupas, a Panamanian who has been with
the agency 27 years, was in Puerto Rico on Thursday. The other
correspondent, Elizabeth F. Lordan, an American citizen, has been
based in Panama for a year.
   UPI, formerly United Press, has had an office in Panama since
the 1930s.
   According to the Justice Ministry, the order was placed on the
door of the UPI office, which is in Cupas' home, as formal
notification, and the agency has two days from the time of the
posting to appeal.
   Luis Romero Villalobos, government director of communications
media, who signed the order, told The Associated Press the decision
was based on ``several cases'' of false information.
   ``It may be that the correspondent is not to blame as they say,
but that the editing desk changed the story,'' he said.
   The Government Ministry fined Lordan $1,500 in August for a
dispatch it said contained false information, and UPI executives
met with Panamanian authorities at the time. Villalobos said UPI
had not paid the fine because the ministry had not yet decided to
collect it.
   Lordan said that she was cited again for another story they said
was false. In both cases, the UPI central editing desk had included
statements made in the United States, not in Panama, she said.
   Government and Justice Minister Renato Pereira told reporters
UPI ``systematically has taken it upon itself to denigrate the
government of Panama and its national leadership. We require of
news agencies objectivity and respect for Panamanian legislation.''
   Asked whether the action was a warning to other news media,
Pereira said: ``It is not a warning, it is a reiteration of a
civilized policy of the Panamanian state, which, as any other
country, requires that its personality be respected, that it not be
denigrated, that what happens in its territory not be crudely
falsified.''
   The government has expelled three foreign correspondents since
1987, but this is the first time it has closed a news agency office.

<HEAD>Malaria Researcher Indicted For Lying On Grant Proposal</HEAD>

   The former chief of the Agency for
International Development's worldwide malaria research program was
indicted Thursday for allegedly lying about a grant proposal.
   Dr. James M. Erickson was accused of falsely stating in a
written report that a proposal by KT&amp;R Laboratories Inc. of St.
Paul, Minn., to devise a simple test for the disease had been
approved by a panel of outside experts.
   The indictment, returned by a federal grand jury in Alexandria,
Va., charged that Erickson, who was also chief of AID's
communicable disease division, knew that the proposal had not been
approved by the review panel.
   If convicted, Erickson could be sentenced to five years in
prison and fined up to $10,000
   The indictment sought by Justice Department prosecutors was
returned a week after the General Accounting Office found financial
irregularities and serious management problems in the malaria
program, which has an annual budget of $9 million.
   The GAO study of the project's operation between 1982 and 1987
found ``waste, fraud and abuse'' as well as ``questionable contract
and grant awards'' and ``inadequate financial management.''
   Without identifying him by name, the GAO report said that as
project manager Erickson ``had more influence than any other
individual over the direction and day-to-day management of the
malaria vaccine research project, and he initiated many of the
questionable actions.''
   The indictment did not specifically describe the KT&amp;R grant at
issue in the criminal case. But it appeared to refer to grant
referred to in the GAO report.
   The GAO report said that AID terminated a $736,801 grant KT&amp;R
after the agency ``found major deficiencies and unreasonably high
expenditures given the subproject's limited accomplishements.''
   In that case, Erickson falsely reported to superiors that the
grant proposal had received favorable reviews from an evaluation
panel. The GAO report also noted that Erickson had made similarly
false statements about an evaluation of a proposal by the
University of Illinois.
   The university received a $2.38 million contract for the
proposed research.
   Both cases were investigated by the inspector general's office
of AID, which referred the information to the Justice Department,
the GAO report said.
   In September, a prominent malaria researcher at the University
of Hawaii, Wasim Siddiqui, and his administrative assistant, Susan
Lofton, were charged by Hawaii authorities with stealing more than
$130,000 in AID research grants to the university.
   They were accused of diverting the money from the university to
help finance an international malaria conference held in Honolulu
in 1985.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir on Thursday
dismissed as ``pure lies'' a news report that Israel traded
ballistic missile technology to South Africa for uranium.
   However, a U.S. official in Washington said South Africa has
test-fired an intermediate-range ballistic missile built with
Israeli technology. The official said the missile could carry
nuclear missiles.
   In South Africa, Foreign Minister Pik Botha said he had no
knowledge of nuclear cooperation between the two countries.
   The Israeli Defense Ministry issued a statement saying, ``There
is no truth whatsoever ... on alleged links between Israel and
South Africa in the nuclear field.''
   The denials came in response to a Wednesday report on NBC-TV
News, which cited unidentified intelligence sources and a CIA
document. NBC's report said Israel provided missile technology to
South Africa in return for a continuous supply of uranium and use
of the Overberg long-range test site in South Africa.
   ``It's pure lies,'' Shamir told reporters at a political rally
in a Tel Aviv suburb. ``All this is baseless.''
   The official in Washington also said, however, that Israel and
South Africa are cooperating in the development of a long-range
missile that could be used to launch satellites.
   Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official said
intelligence reports showed South Africa had tested a modified
version of the Israeli-made Jericho II medium-range missile at
Armaston on the Indian Ocean coast last summer.
   The State Department and Pentagon refused to make formal
statements, but State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
said: ``Our ambassador in Israel has discussed similar reports in
the overall question of proliferation on a number of occasions with
Israel's Ministry of Defense.''
   Shimon Schiffer, a reporter for the Israeli daily Yediot
Ahronot, told Israel television there were reports from Washington
that the report was based on a leak intended to pressure the
government into accepting a U.S.-backed Middle East peace plan.
   Yair Tsaban, a left-wing legislator, demanded that the issue of
Israel's defense ties with South Africa be brought before
Parliament.

   A civilian court on Thursday sentenced two
former army officers to seven years in prison for involvement in a
May 9 coup attempt against President Vinicio Cerezo.
   Both defendants had served prison sentences for their roles in
an earlier failed coup.
   The attempted overthrow this year of Cerezo's 3-year-old
civilian administration was headed by 21 army officers with support
from 300 troops.
   Former Col. Gustavo Adolfo Padilla Morales and former Maj.
Gustavo Adolfo Diaz Lopez were tried in civilian court because they
had been discharged from the armed forces after a May 11, 1988,
coup attempt.
   They were released from prison under a 1988 amnesty, which also
freed civilians accused of taking part in the failed coup earlier
that year.
   The defense lawyer, Edgar Arnoldo Lopez Straub, said his clients
will appeal the sentence of Judge Napoleon Gutierrez Vargas. They
were convicted Wednesday.

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's treasury chief,
Nigel Lawson, and her personal economic adviser both resigned
Thursday in a dramatic government upheaval during difficult
economic times.
   Lawson quit his Cabinet post as chancellor of the exchequer
saying he could not work for Mrs. Thatcher unless she dropped her
adviser, Sir Alan Walters.
   Walters, who was visiting the United States, resigned shortly
afterward.
   Mrs. Thatcher expressed ``the most profound regret'' after
Lawson's resignation but moved quickly to demonstrate stability by
replacing him with her foreign secretary, John Major. Home
Secretary Douglas Hurd became foreign secretary.
   No replacement was announced for Walters, and no other details
on the shakeup were immediately available.
   The financial markets were shaken by the news and the pound fell
3 cents against the dollar.
   Lawson, 57, had held the job since 1983, engineering tax cuts
and an economic recovery that won him Mrs. Thatcher's praise as one
of Britain's greatest chancellors.
   It was the first time since the 1986 resignation of Defense
Secretary Michael Heseltine that Mrs. Thatcher has had a senior
Cabinet official quit on her.
   Lawson and Thatcher appeared to be in close harmony as long as
the economic boom lasted, but when it began to falter 18 months
ago, reports of discord surfaced.
   They were said to disagree over the pound, with Lawson
advocating a managed exchange rate and Mrs. Thatcher insisting it
be controlled by market forces.
   Lawson also was thought to favor Britain joining the European
Monetary System, a mechanism for stabilizing exchange rates. Mrs.
Thatcher favors joining only after Britain's inflation rate moves
down and capital flows freely in Europe.
   Walters bluntly opposed joining the EMS, and has criticized
Lawson's policies.
   In his letter of resignation, Lawson wrote: ``The successful
conduct of economic policy is possible only if there is _ and is
seen to be _ full agreement between the prime minister and the
chancellor of the exchequer.
   ``Recent events have confirmed that this essential requirement
cannot be satisfied so long as Alan Walters remains your personal
economic adviser.''
   Mrs. Thatcher replied: ``You have been responsible for possibly
the most far-reaching reform of our tax structure this century, as
well as for a period of unprecedented growth and prosperity. It is
a matter of particular regret that you should decide to leave
before your task is complete.''
   She said: ``There is no difference in our basic economic
beliefs, and Britain's economy is vastly stronger.''
   Lawson, a former financial journalist, is a member of Parliament
whose career highlight was his 1988 budget, which slashed taxes for
the top income bracket from 60 percent to 40 percent.
   Plump and darkly handsome, he has a boyish, fun-loving manner
and is known to have complained that his government salary is too
low and that he would like to go into business. In July, he lost
his official country residence in what was seen as an unseemly
byproduct of a Cabinet reshuffle.
   Walters, a Johns Hopkins economist, is Mrs. Thatcher's appointee
and is sometimes referred to as her economic guru, one of the group
of free-market apostles who shaped Mrs. Thatcher's thinking in the
1970s.
   He was her adviser from 1981 to 1983, went back to Johns
Hopkins, and returned to a Downing Street post earlier this year in
what was seen as a slight to Lawson.
   On Tuesday night, Lawson publicly rebuked him, telling a TV
interviewer: ``I think it is right that advisers do not talk or
write in public.''
   Opposition Labor Party members, elated at the apparent disarray
in Conservative Party ranks, said Lawson must have made his
decision when Mrs. Thatcher failed to use a regular appearance in
Parliament to express absolute confidence in her chancellor.
   Labor leader Neil Kinnock said: ``When the prime minister failed
to give real support to Nigel Lawson this afternoon, he really
could not stay and it is entirely the prime minister's fault.''
   Mrs. Thatcher gave the job to Major just three months after she
lifted him out of political obscurity and made him foreign
secretary at the age of 46.
   Major is a former senior Treasury official. Born into a
blue-collar family with a father who was for a time a circus
trapeze artist, he represents the new breed of ``working-class
Tories'' who have flourished in the Thatcher decade.
   Major inherits an economy suffering from inflation of 7.6
percent, interest rates at an eight-year high of 15 percent, and a
trade deficit running at record levels this year.
   Labor is up to 10 points ahead of the Tories in opinion polls.
But elections need not be held until mid-1992, giving the new
Thatcher-Major team more than two years to head off a recession and
the threat of electoral defeat.
   Hurd, 59, has served as a junior minister in the Foreign Office,
and was Northern Ireland secretary before moving to the Home Office
in 1985. In Who's Who, he lists his recreation as writing
thrillers. He has written nine.

<HEAD>L.A. Sets Up Centers for Day Laborers, Prompting Immigration Worries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>

   Day laborers, many of them undocumented
aliens who hang out on street corners in hopes of finding work,
have a new friend beginning Friday: the city of Los Angeles. But
immigration officials are concerned.
   City officials hope the program will help keep aliens from being
exploited and will quiet the complaints of merchants and residents
near the many unofficial gathering spots for people seeking
construction or landscaping work.
   The six-month test project is ``a fair compromise on a difficult
issue,'' Councilman Richard Allatore said in February, when the
15-member City Council unanimously approved the $90,000 program.
   But federal immigration officials say contractors and other
employers will have no assurances the workers are legal and will
risk fines under the 1986 immigration reform law, which penalizes
employers who knowingly hire unauthorized aliens.
   Benjamin G. Davidian, western regional commissioner of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service, said Thursday the city will
not check to determine whether workers are authorized but will
simply match them up with potential employers.
   ``They may cause potential employers to be misled into thinking
they're getting workers who have a government stamp of approval for
hiring,'' Davidian said.
   Davidian said there had been meetings with city officials to
discuss the program. ``We're trying to work out the best approach
for everyone.''
   He did not guarantee there would be no raids of the centers, but
said, ``I'm not going to send a phalanx of Border Patrol agents to
sweep through the hiring halls on a daily basis.''
   Davidian said he would have preferred a program like that in the
Orange County city of Costa Mesa, which has banned laborers from
seeking work on the streets and instead checks their documents at a
city-run hiring hall.
   Los Angeles officials and immigrants rights groups have
countered that the city has no legal or moral duty to check
workers' documentation.
   Although residents and merchants in cities throughout Southern
California have complained about the job-hunters, immigrants rights
groups say the right to gather on the streets and seek work is
constitutionally protected.
   ``People are always talking about these lazy, shiftless welfare
people. Here we have a group of people who want to work,'' said
Linda Mitchell of the Coalition for Humange Immigrant Rights of Los
Angeles, an umbrella group for about 50 organzations.
   Ms. Mitchell said the job centers will create a better
environment for the workers.
   At the center opening Friday in the Harbor City district, two
Spanish-speaking city workers with a phone will keep tabs on what
kind of workers employers need and what skills workers have.
   Social service workers are expected to drop in from time to time
to offer free English classes and health-care information.
   If the project succeeds, the number of job centers will increase
to 15.
   The mostly male, mostly Hispanic job-seekers _ some without
skills, some talented craftsmen _ have gathered informally on the
city's streets for years. Their numbers have increased since the
1986 immigration law.
   Not all the workers are unauthorized. In July 1988, for example,
63 illegal aliens were arrested in sweeps of sections of Placentia
and Orange where day laborers gather. But about the same number
proved they had applied for amnesty.

<HEAD>Two Members to Visit Lebanon Despite Warnings</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two members of Congress planned to spend the
weekend in Beirut to meet with Lebanese Christian Gen. Michel Aoun,
despite warnings from the State Department that their lives could
be in danger.
   Reps. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio, and Nick Rahall, D-W.Va., were
scheduled to leave Thursday night and return to Washington Sunday
afternoon, said Ambassador Clovis Maksoud, the Arab League envoy in
Washington.
   ``They are going to try and lend their moral support to the Arab
League efforts to bring peace to Lebanon,'' he said.
   The offices of both lawmakers declined any comment on the trip,
and it could not be confirmed that they had left.
   The State Department also declined to discuss the trip, but
noted that travel to Lebanon was banned for most Americans. Eight
Americans are being held hostage by Iranian-backed extremists there.
   The danger for Americans is compounded by the fact that the U.S.
Embassy evacuated all its personnel last month in response to
veiled threats of kidnapping by Aoun.
   ``There is no support we can provide for Americans there now,''
said one official. ``It's a very unsafe place, life-threatening.''
   But Maksoud insisted the two American lawmakers would be safe.
   ``It's not a problem,'' he said. Security is guaranteed in the
city by a committee of officers from several Arab League members,
including Algeria and Saudi Arabia, he said. ``Necessary measures
will be taken.''
   Aoun has rejected the plan for ending Lebanon's 14-year civil
war, saying it fails to set a deadline for the pullout of 40,000
Syrian troops sent into the country in 1976. The plan, worked out
by Christian and Moslem lawmakers after three weeks of
deliberations in Saudi Arabia, would shift control of the country's
political institutions from the Christian minority into the hands
of the Moslem majority.
   Oakar and Rahall, both of Lebanese descent, visited Lebanon in
1982 at the height of the fighting between Israeli, Syrian and
Lebanese troops to condemn the Israeli invasion of Lebanon.
   Ms. Oakar sought to travel to Beirut again in August but was
asked by the State Department to refrain from traveling to the
capital which was under intense artillery pressure from Syrian and
Lebanese Christian gunners.

   A Politburo member met with pro-democracy leaders
Thursday, a first for the orthodox Communists who run East Germany,
and authorities urged reform activists to stop voicing their
demands in street protests.
   About 100,000 people in Dresden ignored the appeal and attended
a rally Thursday night at which speakers demanded rapid reform,
Lutheran Church sources said.
   ADN, the official news agency, said thousands showed up earlier
in the day for a meeting on reform sponsored by Communist Party
officials in the southern industrial city.
   It said 15,000 people conducted a candlelight march through
downtown Erfurt, in the southwest, and that 25,000 people marched
through Rostock on the Baltic coast.
   The news agency said 5,000 demonstrated in Gera, west of
Dresden, shouting ``Democracy, Now or Never!'' and ``We are the
People!''
   Premier Willi Stoph announced that more high-quality consumer
goods would be imported. Although East Germany's economy is the
envy of Soviet bloc neighbors, such goods often can be found only
in hard-currency shops.
   Egon Krenz, the nation's new leader, spoke by telephone for 20
minutes with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany, the haven for
tens of thousands of East Germans who fled in search of freedom. It
was their first contact since Krenz replaced Erich Honecker as
party chief last week.
   A statement from the national lawyers' union called for
multiple-candidate elections and public control of vote counting,
ADN reported.
   The two-hour meeting between Guenter Schabowski and two leaders
of New Forum, largest of the new pro-democracy organizations, was
the first of a member of the ruling party Politburo with the
opposition.
   New Forum is officially banned, although tolerated, and the
party had said it would not talk to opposition groups.
   Schabowski, also the East Berlin party chief, met with Jens
Reich, a molecular biologist at the Academy of Sciences, and
physicist Sebastian Pflugbeil, both founding members of New Forum.
   Reich told reporters after the meeting, held in the Communist
Party Central Committee building, that the ``talks were open and
constructive.''
   ``We presented New Forum's concepts and ideas,'' he said.
   Asked why Schabowski invited them, Reich said: ``He told us he
wanted to begin a new political course and wanted to learn about
the whole political spectrum here.''
   He said Schabowski assured him the government's new interest in
dialogue as a way of solving the nation's problems ``was a real
change and not a tactical move.''
   When asked if he believed that, the scientist replied: ``We will
see. I can say cautiously that I have a positive impression.''
   Official recognition of New Forum was discussed, Reich said, but
Schabowski told him it was ``beyond his capacity.'' The
organization was banned last month.
   ADN reported that Reich and Pflugbeil, described as ``members of
an initiative group that calls itself New Forum,'' had met with
Schabowski.
   New Forum, which advocates democratic change within the
communist system, claims more than 15,000 members.
   Krenz hinted Wednesday the opposition might be included in
discussion of reform, but repeated that the Communist Party's
leading role in society was not to be questioned.
   On Wednesday night, about 20,000 people marched in
Neubrandenburg and 5,000 in Jena despite the new leadership's
promise earlier in the day to permit freer travel and consider
reform.
   A protest by more than 300,000 people Monday in Leipzig was the
largest in the nation's 40-year history.
   Police initially used clubs to break up peaceful pro-democracy
protests, but have not done so since Oct. 9.
   Mayor Erhard Krack of East Berlin invited ``citizens interested
in dialogue'' to attend a discussion Sunday, ADN reported. In
Dresden, it said, government leaders met Thursday to discuss
regional reforms.
   Schabowski and other officials have appealed to citizens to stop
the protests. He told West German TV on Wednesday he had spoken
with Lutheran Church officials and asked them to use their
influence.
   Neues Deutschland, the Communist Party newspaper, said in a
commentary Thursday: ``We need dialogue, not howling unrest.''
   Dresden's mayor said a recent peaceful march there was marred by
a people ``who, instead of seeking dialogue, shouted `Red bums!'
`Communist pigs!' and `Hang them!'''
   Kohl's spokesman, Hans Klein, said the West German chancellor
telephoned Krenz to discuss ways of improving relations.
   An ADN dispatch said Krenz made clear to Kohl that East Germany
would remain a Communist state and asked once again that Bonn
recognize separate East German citizenship.
   West Germany's policy of immediately recognizes any German
immigrant as a citizen has been a major factor in the flight over
the past few months of more than 60,000 East Germans, most of them
young, skilled workers.
   Both Krenz and Kohl have expressed interest in a summit, but it
is not expected before next year.

   A federal jury convicted three men and
acquitted two others Thursday on charges they conspired with
Colombian drug kingpin Carlos Lehder Rivas to smuggle cocaine into
the United States.
   The jury reached its verdict after 18 hours of deliberation over
three days in the so-called ``Son of Lehder'' trial, which grew out
of testimony in last year's trial of Lehder. Lehder, 40, reputedly
one of the founders of the Medellin cocaine cartel, was convicted
and is serving a life prison term.
   The five defendants in the seven-week-long trial were accused of
conspiring with Lehder to either smuggle cocaine into the United
States or distribute it once it got there.
   Jack Carlton Reed, 59, was found guilty of conspiracy to
distribute cocaine and operating a continuing criminal enterprise.
Reed was convicted last year on drug conspiracy charges and
sentenced to 15 years in prison.
   Prosecutors called Reed one of Lehder's chief lieutenants who
worked as Lehder's contact with Americans in the organization.
   Hyannis, Mass., attorney Barry Kane, 52, and Donald Lady, 41, of
Pomona, Calif., were both convicted of conspiracy to import
cocaine, but were found innocent of conspiracy to distribute
cocaine.
   Kane collapsed after U.S. District Judge John H. Moore II
formally pronounced him guilty, but was quickly revived.
   Reed, Kane and Lady face prison sentences of 10 years to life.
Moore ordered them held pending sentencing Jan. 12.
   According to the charges, Kane picked up 250 kilograms of
cocaine from cartel leader Pablo Escobar's ranch and flew it back
to the U.S. on two occasions in the summer of 1977.
   Lady was accused of acquiring a ranch in the Baja peninsula to
be used as a waystation for cocaine flights from Colombia in early
1987.
   Acquitted were Thomas H. Herington, 35, of Mill Valley, Calif.,
and Samuel T. Stewart, 53, of Anaheim,
   ``Justice prevailed,'' said Stewart, who was accused of flying
cocaine from Colombia to Norman's Cay in the summer of 1978, as he
left the courthouse following the 7-week-long trial. ``If it is any
consolation, I was innocent.''
   Stewart's attorney, Kevin Sanders, said the trial had damaged
his client's air-charter business as well as his health and
reputation.
   Herington, a student in engineering physics, refused to comment,
but his attorney, Patrick Hallinan of San Francisco said, ``It's a
great pleasure. He's very, very happy.''
   Herington, who was accused of transporting cocaine from Orlando
to California in a rented Lear jet in the late 1970s, had testified
he didn't know Lehder and had withdrawn from the conspiracy more
than five years ago. The statute of limitations for the crime is
five years.
   Raymond David, who represented Lady, said he couldn't understand
how his client could have been found guilty when others were
acquitted.
   ``It's inconsistent,'' David said. ``He was not very happy.''
   The prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Attorney Ernst Mueller, said
jurors had a difficult job sorting out the evidence. He also said
he wanted to prosecute all the cartel leaders in the indictment.
   ``It is our hope we can get Pablo Escobar, Gonzalo Rodriguez
Gacha, Jorge Ochoa, Fabio Ochoa and Gonzalo Mejia,'' he said,
naming several leaders. ``We feel we have the best case against
them.''

<HEAD>An Escape from Quake: Mock Court Settles Question on Doughnut Hole</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After nine stressful days since the
earthquake, the audience was ready Thursday to look away from
nature's fury and consider what isn't there.
   The issue: Who invented the doughnut hole?
   ``Mankind, in its own wisdom, invented the hole in the
doughnut,'' Municipal Court Judge George T. Choppelas ruled after
an hour of hilarious legal outrage in the 59th session of the mock
San Francisco Court of Historical Review.
   So ruling, if meaninglessly, the judge shot down conflicting
opinions that the hole in the doughnut may have been the work of a
Dutch sea captain, a nearsighted Chinese baker 4,600 years ago, or
an Italian cook who took his eye off the pasta.
   The judge, a real jurist in a real courtroom, started the
whimsical proceedings on a serious note, telling a standing room
audience of 100 people that he had second thoughts about convening
the mock court because of the deadly terror of last week's
earthquake.
   ``We almost did cancel,'' Choppelas said. ``But this is a part
of a tradition of San Francisco. We do this for those who expect it
and enjoy it.''
   After all, he said, was this not the forum where has been
decided such weighty matters as: ``Where was the martini
invented?'' ``Is chicken soup Jewish penicillin?'' Who invented
spaghetti?'' and ``Did Albert Einstein have a fling with Marilyn
Monroe.''
   With that, the ``trial'' commenced, and attorney Frank Winston
said his opposing counsel had laryngitis and the case could be
settled without further ado. He was for the Dutch sea captain.
   ``I object,'' said San Francisco Supervisor Angela Alioto,
arguing that an Italian, inspired either by the Roman Coliseum or a
ciambella, a tire, invented the hole.
   Wearing kitchen duds, chef Jo Jung of the restaurant of the same
name took the stand to testify that an anonymous chef 46 centuries
ago was frying some dough and stuck a chopstick through it.
   ``That's where we get hole,'' Jung testified, whipping out a
package of Chinese dumplings he deftly impaled with a handy
chopstick. ``That how,'' he said trumphantly, offering a morsel to
the judge.
   ``Bribery!'' hollered Winston.
   After Choppelas threw Jung off the stand, Italian chef and
restaurateur Angelo Quaranta of the Allegro was called.
   ``Hah,'' he sneered. ``Jung is a cook. I am a chef.'' And he
hauled out his toque and planted it on his head.
   Jung leaped to his feet, Winston called for a bailiff and the
judge held his head.
   ``It was an Italian, I tell you,'' Quaranta testified
passionately as he was ejected from the witness chair.
   ``I object!'' yelled Jung.
   In the end, the Italian chef ordered a tray of his own doughnuts
handed around the courtroom, with napkins.

   Research scientists on Thursday criticized the
Energy Department's plans for greater competition for funds between
two different approaches toward harnessing fusion, the energy
source of the sun and stars.
   The researchers told a House panel they would like to see a
substantial increase, perhaps as much as a doubling, of government
support for both approaches, magnetic fusion and inertial
confinement fusion.
   ``A billion dollars a year to me does not seem like too much to
have an energy future,'' said Robert L. McCrory, director of the
Laboratory for Laser Energetics at the University of Rochester.
   For the current fiscal year that began Oct. 1, the department
has about $510 million for fusion research _ $340 million for
magnetic fusion and $170 for inertial confinement fusion.
   Fusion is the release of energy by the combination of certain
forms of hydrogen atoms to make helium. Enormous amounts of energy
are required to trigger the reaction.
   The magnetic approach uses powerful magnetic fields to compress
a superheated gas plasma whirling at high speed within a
doughnut-shaped apparatus known as a tokamak.
   The inertial confinement approach would fire laser or particle
beams at a pea-sized target to try to attain the extremely high
temperatures and pressures needed.
   In opening the hearing, Rep. Robert A. Roe, D-N.J., chairman of
the House Science investigations and oversight subcommittee, said
that ``fusion energy needs to be a central part of our energy
policy for the next century.''
   ``We should take the lead in developing for the world a
technology that will allow China to stop burning dirty coal, that
will remove the need for using the Amazon forest as a fuel source,
and that will save our atmosphere from pollution and warming,'' he
said.
   Earlier this month, Robert O. Hunter, director of the Energy
Department's Office of Energy Research, testified the department
favors a competition between magnetic and inertial confinement
fusion, with a winner to be selected early in the next century.
   However, McCrory said he was worried that such a competition
could be used as a pretext for shortchanging the effort to achieve
useful fusion energy.
   Erik Storm, deputy associate director for inertial confinement
fusion at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore,
Calif., said the two approaches to fusion ``should be complementary
and collaborative, rather than being in competition.''
   He predicted that ``very ambitious'' research and development
probably could produce prototype fusion plants by 2020, but without
substantial increases in spending it might take 30 to 50 years
longer.

   Incidents of shootings on Los Angeles County
roads soared between 1985 and 1987, but, contrary to popular
belief, most gunplay occurred on streets instead of highways,
researchers said Thursday.
   ``It was occurring on the surface streets and everyone thought
it was the freeways, so they were trying to avoid the freeways,''
said Chukwudi Onwuachi-Saunders, lead author of the study published
in Friday's Journal of the American Medical Association.
   In 45 percent of the cases, drivers said there was no
confrontation before the attack, said the researchers from the
national Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
   There were 32 firearm assaults on roadways in 1985, followed by
91 in 1986 and 137 in 1987, said the researchers, who used figures
compiled by California law enforcement agencies. Assaults were
defined as shootings or the threatening display of a gun.
   California authorities were unable to provide 1988 figures
Thursday, but California Highway Patrol Officer Jill Angel said the
number of highway shootings had dropped dramatically since 1987.
   ``Our last confirmed shooting was in July 1988,'' she said.
   ``Highway violence is still going on, in terms of fights between
drivers,'' Angel added. ``We average anywhere between five and 10
incidents a week. We just aren't getting the reported shootings.''
   Of the 137 assaults in 1987, 83, or 61 percent, were actual
shootings, the study said. In the other 54 cases, a gun was
displayed but not fired. The breakdown for other years was not
provided.
   Two of the 1987 shootings were fatal and 15 caused wounds, said
the authors, who had been asked by California health officials to
look into highway shootings.
   The assaults occurred on all types of roads, but usually took
place on surface streets, defined as streets with speed limits of
35 mph or less, said Onwuachi-Saunders.
   Of the 1987 cases, only 49, or 36 percent, occurred on freeways
and one incident occurred on a highway, the researchers said.
Unlike freeways, highways have intersections and traffic lights.
   In 38 percent of the incidents, victims told police some sort of
interaction with the gunman had occurred, such as changing lanes,
the study said. But in 45 percent no such provocation had taken
place. Seventeen percent were unsure whether a driving-associated
act had prompted the attack.
   Onwuachi-Saunders said the chances of being assaulted by someone
carrying a gun while driving are tiny.``The overall number of
roadway assaults was very small,'' she said.
   However, the National Safety Council is so concerned with driver
behavior that it is initiating a course on driving attitudes, said
John McCarthy of the non-profit organization's driver improvement
section.
   A driver angered by another driver should not take the slight
personally, McCarthy said.
   ``You don't know what's going on in the other person's head,''
he said. ``They could be involved in an emergency situation, they
could be on the phone ... but it's not a personal thing. Life is
too short to get that upset at another driver.''

   Bolar Pharmaceutical Co. has agreed to extend
a recall of an antibiotic used to treat urinary tract infections to
include drugstore shelves, the Food and Drug Administration said
Thursday.
   Bolar had agreed Oct. 6 to recall its generic nitrofurantoin
macrocrystalline antibiotic capsules from distributors and
wholesalers, but the FDA had said it wanted the drug removed from
pharmacies as well. The agency had said it would recommend legal
action if the company did not comply.
   The agency requested the recall because it said it had evidence
that Bolar substituted the brand name product _ Norwich Eaton's
Macrodantin _ for its own in tests required for FDA approval.
   The FDA said that while no safety problems were found with the
drug, the agency could not assure that it was therapeutically
equivalent to Macrodantin.
   In a letter to its customers Wednesday, Bolar requested they
extend the recall to the retail level.
   In addition to the recall request, the FDA is trying to revoke
the company's approval to sell the drug.

<TEXT>
   Canadian observers of Nicaragua's election
preparations said Thursday that United States is doing everything
it can to disrupt the elections set for next year.
   ``American intervention continues as the main obstacle to the
attainment of free and fair elections in Nicaragua,'' the
Registration Observer Mission said in a report prepared after four
weeks in the Central American country.
   The group also said U.S.-backed Contra rebels were trying to
sabotage the elections set for Feb. 25. Nicaragua's leftist
Sandinista government has made the same charge.
   The four-man Canadian observer mission was sponsored by the
Committee for Peace and Democracy in Nicaragua, a group of
representatives of church, human rights and academic groups as well
as unions and development agencies.
   Its report said the U.S. government is disrupting the election
process by its continued support of Contra guerrillas and by
large-scale massive illegal financing of opposition groups and
parties.
   Robert Fox, who coordinated the observer mission, said the U.S.
actions are all part of a strategy to destabilize the election
process.
   The report said the U.S. government is spending millions of
dollars supporting the United National Opposition, an opposition
party, and other anti-government groups. It called the aid an
``intrusion on Nicaraguan sovereignty.''
   Earlier this month, President Bush signed a $9 million aid
package designed to support Nicaraguan opposition groups.
   The Bush administration wants to see President Daniel Ortega's
government voted out of office and contends that election
preparations unfairly benefit the Sandinistas.
   The elections come under a regional peace plan under which five
Central American presidents agreed to disband the Contras _ based
in neighboring Honduras _ by Dec. 8. In exchange, Ortega moved up
the election date from 1991 and promised free balloting.
   The Canadian observers said the Contras are ``waging a campaign
of intimidation with the clear message, `If you support the
(Sandinista government), we will be back to kill you.'''
   Contras killed 42 people last month in election violence, Fox
said.
   Last year, Washington cut off military aid to the Contras, but
it still supplies them with non-lethal aid.

   Retired engineering professor George
Housner will head Gov. George Deukmejian's investigation of the
Oakland freeway collapse, the governor's office announced Thursday.
   His short-lived predecessor, meanwhile, applauded the
appointment while offering his own theories on what might have
caused the collapse during the Oct. 17 earthquake that killed more
than three dozen motorists.
   Housner, professor emeritus at the California Institute of
Technology in Pasadena, ``is the elder statesman of earthquake
engineering in this country,'' said Ian Buckle, who occupied
Housner's post until Monday when Deukmejian decided he had
compromised his objectivity. The governor issued no comment on his
latest appointment other than to say his work ``must be fair,
objective, and complete.''
   ``George Housner certainly has the stature and therefore I would
expect him to do a good job,'' said Buckle, reached at his desk at
the National Center for Earthquake Engineering Research in Buffalo,
N.Y..
   Housner will head an unnamed panel of experts in the search for
reasons and circumstances behind the collapse of the 1.4-mile
elevated freeway. The performance of the state Department of
Transportation will fall under the panel's scrutiny, Deukmejian has
indicated.
   On Monday, Deukmejian said Buckle, also a noted earthquake
engineer, would be replaced after the governor learned that Buckle
had published an article the previous Thursday that, among other
things, defended the transportation department.
   Buckle, who served about four days, said Thursday that he
actually offered to resign after learning from transportation
Director Robert Best late Sunday that the governor had doubts
``about my objectivity.''
   Buckle, largely unreachable since last week, on Wednesday threw
his theories into the bubbling brew of what might have caused the
I-880 double-decker to collapse.
   ``First of all, I want to say that I believe there will be
surprises. There will be lessons to learn from this collapse. The
obvious thing is that the columns failed,'' said Buckle, who was
among the first experts to spend extensive time at the site. ``The
question is: did they fail first, or was it something else?'' he
said.
   Other factors, he said, could range from a theory advanced
Wednesday by Berkeley scientists that the base of the upper-deck
columns failed first, to a theory of unstable ground beneath, and a
lack of uniform rigidity along the length of the structure. ``We
have learned from the past that variations in rigidity can cause
problems in earthquakes,'' he said.
   As for the Berkeley scientists' theory, Buckle said, ``It makes
sense that where the thighbone connects to the shinbone, so to
speak, you're going to have problems. I would say that (theory)
probably is a good one.''
   In another development, Clayton Giroux, the designer of the
collapsed I-880, said he watched in horror as televised newscasts
showed the wreckage of what he had viewed as one of his greatest
engineering achievements.
   Giroux, 63, added: But he added, ``I don't have guilt over it,
just a strong sense of disappointment and tragedy.''
   ``Out of this will come learning similar to Sylmar (the 1971
earthquake in Southern California) and future lives will be
saved,'' Giroux said. ``Unfortunately, we only learn about
earthquakes from earthquakes.''

<TEXT>
   State officials in August had enough
concern about the seismic weaknesses of three San Francisco Bay
area elevated freeways to seek expedited repairs.
   But the almost identical I-880 freeway, which collapsed in last
week's quake, wasn't mentioned, an internal memorandum shows. State
engineers have said several times since the collapse that they
firmly believed I-880 would not fall down in a quake.
   The memo, from James Gates, a structural engineer with the state
Transportation Department's special projects office, to engineer
Bill Jones, described extensive ``seismic retrofit'' work needed
for San Francisco's Embarcadero Freeway.
   The memo adds that San Francisco's I-280 Viaduct and its Central
Viaduct also ``are known to contain this vulnerable
configuration,'' and at the request of chief structural engineer
Jim Roberts, should also be added to the ``phase 2 retrofit
program'' along with the Embarcadero.
   All three structures were closed with extensive damage after
last week's 7.1-magnitude quake, but none collapsed like I-880,
also called the Nimitz Freeway.
   Roberts, asked to comment during Caltrans' daily press briefing
Thursday, said Gates ``may have written a memo ... I haven't seen
that memo,'' and added that much of it was ``not accurate.''
   He said that among the four Bay Area, double-decker freeways,
only the Embarcadero had been singled out for expedited seismic
strengthening.
   But according to Gates, the department performed a seismic study
on I-280 and the Central Viaduct. Roberts said again Thursday that
his department had not analyzed the Nimitz for earthquake strength
since 1977, when was fitted with cables to strengthen horizontal
decking against quakes. That 1977 analysis cannot be found, Roberts
said earlier this week.
   The Gates memo notes that the design of some vertical columns on
the upper deck of the Embarcadero create ``a potentially unstable
situation'' and need strengthening. The same condition exists on
I-280 and the Central Viaduct.

   Japanese writer Kazuo Ishiguro won the 1989 Booker
Prize, Britain's top literary award, for his novel ``The Remains of
the Day,'' judges announced Thursday.
   The prize is worth $32,000.
   Judges praised the novel, a love story about a butler's English
vacation, as ``a cunningly structured and beautifully paced
performance.''
   Other finalists this year were Canadian Margaret Atwood for
``Cat's Eye,'' Irish author John Banville for ``Book of Evidence,''
Scotland's James Kelman for ``A Disaffection'' and English writers
Sybille Bedford for ``Jigsaw'' and Rose Tremain for ``Restoration.''
   After receiving the prize, Ishiguro paid tribute to Salman
Rushdie, the 1988 runner-up for the award, who went into hiding in
February when he was threatened with death by Moslems who said his
novel ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemed their faith.
   ``Now that circumstances have changed, when perhaps it is
inconvenient for many people to support his writing, I just felt it
was fitting that we should not turn our backs on him,'' Ishiguro
said.
   Rushdie lives in England. Ishiguro, 39, arrived in England at
age 6 and now lives in south London. He writes in English.
   In announcing the winner, the judges said: ```The Remains of the
Day' renders with humor and pathos a memorable character and
explores the large, vexed themes of class, tradition and duty. It
was narrowly preferred but universally admired.''
   Ishiguro was a finalist for the Booker Prize in 1986 for his
novel ``An Artist of the Floating World.''
   The Booker Prize is sponsored by Booker, an international food
and agriculture business.

   A tanker carrying more than 14 million
gallons of North Slope crude oil remained in limbo Thursday after
state officials refused to let the vessel dock without a
state-approved oil spill contingency plan.
   The Unocal Corp. vessel, the SanSinena II, was bound for the
Tesoro-Alaska Petroleum Co. refinery with 14.7 million gallons of
oil when the state Department of Environmental Conservation denied
it permission to dock on Tuesday.
   DEC Commissioner Dennis Kelso said the agency had checked the
schedule of incoming tanker traffic and noticed the tanker had no
state-approved spill plan.
   ``We're still continuing to work on the problem,'' said Barry
Lane, a Unocal spokesman in Los Angeles. ``We do know we do have a
plan for the vessel. We thought we had a state-approved plan. We're
in the process of updating it.''
   Cook Inlet and Prince William Sound have been the focus of
heightened DEC review since the March 24 grounding of the tanker
Exxon Valdez. The 11 million gallon spill coated 1,000 miles of
shoreline from the Sound to Cook Inlet, disrupting fishing seasons.
   After the grounding, the DEC announced that Cook Inlet tanker
traffic would be re-examined. The department said it would turn
away tankers lacking appropriate spill contingency plans.
   Kelso, however, said the Unocal tanker was nabbed under a law
strengthened last year after the tanker Glacier Bay in July 1987
spilled 125,000 gallons of oil into the inlet's salmon-rich waters.
   The law requires spill contingency plans for any vessel carrying
more than 420,000 gallons of oil, and allows the DEC to ensure they
will work.
   The 810-foot Unocal tanker, with a capacity of slightly more
than 22 million gallons, has been sailing between Alaska and San
Francisco since it was built in 1971, Lane said.
   Larry Dietrick, the DEC's environmental quality director, said
Unocal had asked for and been denied a variance that would allow
the tanker to load or unload in Cook Inlet.
   The SanSinena II is the third tanker caught this year operating
in Cook Inlet waters without a spill plan, Kelso said.
   Unocal had planned for the vessel to unload its cargo at the
refinery in Nikiski, a small port community on the Kenai Peninsula.
The ship was then supposed to pick up Cook Inlet crude oil before
returning to California, said Joe Sautner, an environmental field
officer in the DEC's oil program.
   Unocal submitted a plan for the tanker late Wednesday, and it
was under review Thursday, Kelso said. State officials have up to
65 days to review such plans, but they said it seldom takes that
long.
   While Unocal made reference to plans submitted in 1978 and 1984,
those could not be found and would have expired in three years,
Sautner said.
   Sautner said the new Unocal plan would be reviewed carefully,
but he added that state officials were anxious to find some way of
allowing the tanker to unload to reduce the chances of an incident.
   ``We are suggesting they (Unocal officials) first look into
whether they can contract with another company that has an approved
plan, so they might be covered that way,'' DEC spokesman Joe
Ferguson.
   Unocal has other vessels, but not working in Cook Inlet and
carrying the necessary plan, Sautner said.
   If another company amended its plan to incorporate the tanker,
the vessel would be treated as that company's in the event of a
spill, and that might make it difficult to find a willing company,
he said.

   A China Airlines Boeing 737 crashed into a
bamboo-covered mountain Thursday minutes after taking off from the
eastern city of Hualien, and airline officials said all 54 people
aboard were feared dead.
   Rescuers found 21 bodies and the wreckage in a mountain valley
early Friday after the search resumed at first light, airline
officials and radio reports said.
   The official Broadcasting Corp. of China said there was no sign
of survivors.
   In a report from the crash site, the radio said most bodies were
burned beyond recognition and rescuers were able immediately to
identify only the body of J. Wayne Phillips, 46, vice president of
Universal Paint Corp. in City of Industry, a Los Angeles suburb. A
company secretary said Phillips was in Taiwan on business.
   All on board were Taiwanese except Phillips.
   Rescuers began the arduous task of carrying the bodies on the
three-hour walk down the mountain to hospitals in Hualien.
   China Airlines, Taiwan's flag carrier, quoted Hualien control
tower officials as saying they instructed the plane to turn right
and fly over the sea, but the jet turned left over land instead. No
explanation was given.
   The crash occurred about 7 p.m. near Chia Min, a village of
about 2,000 people, five minutes after the plane left Hualien's
airport. It was en route to Taipei 93 miles to the northwest,
carrying 47 passengers and a crew of seven.
   China Airlines spokesman Lodge Lo said the passengers included
four members of a family who were flying to attend the funeral of
another family member.
   A witness who identified himself Li Yi-chang said he saw the
plane hit the mountain. ``Suddenly, there were huge flames and an
explosion,'' said Li.
   About 300 rescue workers headed to the rugged, bamboo-covered
mountain on foot but initially could not find the wreckage because
of poor visibility, police said. They said rain had drenched the
fire.
   The search resumed shortly after dawn Friday, and rescuers found
a wing and other fragments of the plane, indicating the aircraft
had exploded after it crashed, according to the radio report.
   ``We still cannot figure out why the accident happened. The
plane is only 2 years old and it was in good condition,'' Lo said.
   In Seattle, Boeing Commercial Airplanes spokesman Tom Cole
identified the aircraft as a 737-200 delivered to China Airlines in
December 1986. He had no other details.
   Taiwan's worst air disaster was in 1981, when 110 people died in
the crash of a Far Eastern Air Transport Boeing 737.
   In 1986, another China Airlines' Boeing 737 crashed into the sea
on a domestic flight, killing 13 people aboard.

<TEXT>
   Novelist and critic Mary McCarthy, whose
scathing wit and bold explorations of social mores made her one of
America's preeminent literary lions, died of cancer Wednesday at
the age of 77.
   Miss McCarthy died at New York Hospital, said Dixie Sheridan,
spokeswoman for the author's alma mater, Vassar College in
Poughkeepsie.
   Though she first made her mark among the brawling New York
intellectuals of the 1930s, writing literary and theatrical reviews
for The Nation and Partisan Review, Miss McCarthy reached a wider
audience only in 1963 with her novel, ``The Group.''
   The spicy, best-selling chronicle of the lives of eight college
graduates starting out in the 1930s was made into a movie in 1966.
   Miss McCarthy had an ``unerring ability to spot the hidden
weakness or inconsistency in any literary effort and every person.
To this weakness she instinctively leaped with cries of pleasure _
surprised that her victim, as he lay torn and bleeding, did not
applaud her perspicacity,'' wrote Alfred Kazin, a member and
chronicler of New York's jazz age intellectuals.
   Norman Mailer once called her ``our first lady of letters.''
   She provoked a celebrated literary feud with Lillian Hellman by
declaring, on national television, ``Everything she writes is a
lie, including `and' and `the.'''
   Hellman sued for libel, but died in 1984 before the suit reached
a trial which Miss McCarthy eagerly sought.
   She had also been sued by a former lover, Partisan Review editor
Philip Rahv, who objected to her portrait of him in ``The Oasis.''
The suit was dropped.
   ``She had a reputation for being a sharp and dangerous woman but
there was no justification whatever for it in the sphere of her
friendships,'' said poet James Merrill, one of Miss McCarthy's
close friends, upon hearing of her death.
   William Jovanovich, chairman of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc.,
Miss McCarthy's publisher, said in a statement: ``She treasured
intelligence and wit and was herself blessed with both. Mary
McCarthy doubted much but was never a cynic. Her political views
were at times criticized, at times applauded, but were at all times
selfless.''
   ``She was very, very clever and also very brave in saying what
she thought,'' said essayist Elizabeth Hardwick, another close
friend. ``There was no trendiness in Mary. She stood up for what
she believed in.''
   Most of her writing was autobiographical, beginning with ``The
Company She Keeps,'' published in 1942, a series of interconnected
short stories about the people she knew in New York during the
Depression.
   ``Memories of a Catholic Girlhood,'' published in 1957 and now
considered a landmark in autobiographical writing, recounted her
sordid childhood in Minneapolis where she was brutally mistreated
by relatives after her parents died.
   She was awarded many honors for her work, including membership
in the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the National
Institute of Arts and Letters, two Guggenheim Fellowships, the
National Medal for Literature, and the Horizon Prize.
   Miss McCarthy was born in Seattle on June 21, 1912, the daughter
of Roy Winfield McCarthy and Therese Preston McCarthy, a handsome
and romantic couple who died within a day of each other during the
flu epidemic of 1918.
   Mary, who was 6, and three younger brothers were entrusted to
the care of Aunt Margaret and Uncle Meyers, sadistic and miserly
guardians who dressed them like paupers, fed them a diet of root
vegetables, forbade reading and, at night, taped their mouths shut
``to prevent mouth breathing.''
   ``How I Grew,'' published in 1987 as a sequel to ``Memories,''
described her timely rescue at 11 by her maternal grandparents who
took her west to Tacoma, Wash., and enrolled her in the fashionable
Annie Wright Seminary. The book, she once wrote, was the story of
the birth of a mind.
   The seminary, where she became an atheist, prepared her for
Vassar, where she hobnobbed with the bright, wealthy Eastern
society girls she used as models for her characters in ``The
Group.''
   With her keen eye for detail, ruthless wit and deep insight,
Miss McCarthy for decades was regarded the ultimate highbrow of New
York radical and intellectual circles. She moved to Paris in 1962,
dividing her time between a comfortable Left Bank apartment and her
home in Castine, Maine. In recent years, she occupied a creative
writing chair at Bard College in Annadale-on-Hudson, N.Y.
   One week after graduation in 1933, she married Harold Johnsrud,
an actor. The marriage was brief and in 1938, Miss McCarthy married
her professor, the eminent critic Edmund Wilson. They had one son,
Reuel, before a bitter divorce in which each accused the other of
battery.
   She met her fourth husband, James West, while on a trip to
Warsaw, divorced her third husband Bowden Broadwater and married
West in Paris in 1961.
   Combative, outspoken and independent, Miss McCarthy wrote about
subjects as diverse as the pretentious world of academia (``A
Charmed Life'') and terrorists (``Cannibals and Missionaries'').
   Taken as a whole, her work explored the concerns of McCarthy's
liberal intellectual set from the 1930s through the 1970s: sexual
freedom in the 30s, radicalism in the 40s and 50s, Vietnam and
social and moral upheaval of the 60s the Watergate scandal and the
rise of terrorism in the 70s.
   McCarthy was often hailed as a feminist before her time. But she
always refused that label, saying equality between the sexes was
unrealistic.
   ``Somebody has to give more,'' she told an interviewer in 1987.
Her belief was simple: women should learn to think for themselves
and act accordingly.
   If she appeared cold and hard in her judgments of others, she
was even harder on herself. At 74, on the eve of the publication of
``How I Grew'' in 1987, she was asked her assessment of herself.
``Not favorable,'' she replied.
   She is survived by West and her son. A private funeral was
planned for next week in Castine.

   About 1,200 of the 12,000
Salvadoran refugees in Honduras began returning home Wednesday as
part of a U.N.-sponsored program that refugees and their supporters
said had stalled.
   ``Everything is ready for them to go back home,'' said Ulrich
von Blumenthal, the U.N. High Commission for Refugees
representative in Tegucigalpa.
   His agency contracted for 41 buses and 150 trucks to carry the
refugees and their few belongings back to El Salvador.
   Blumenthal said the convoy probably would reach El Salvador
before dawn Thursday, traveling slowly over dangerous, dirt roads.
   The Salvadorans have been living in refugee camps operated by
the United Nations during the nearly 10-year-old civil war in their
homeland. Those returning first have been staying in a camp at Mesa
Grande, 35 miles from the Salvadoran border, 225 miles west of
Tegucigalpa.
   They included 189 refugees who abandoned the camp to make a
seven-mile protest march Oct. 16 to a small Roman Catholic church
in San Marcos de Ocotepeque.
   Spokesmen for the refugees said they protested to pressure the
United Nations into providing transportation for the return to El
Salvador.
   Blumenthal maintained the refugees moved because they did not
want to be caught by authorities who showed up later at Mesa Grande
to check documents. He said his commission does not aid the return
of undocumented refugees.
   About 20 members of the U.S. church group Going Home formed a
human chain around the San Marcos church to protect the refugees
from ``the repression and the aggressive attitude of the Honduran
army,'' they said in a communique.
   Blumenthal said the Honduran soldiers ``are there to facilitate
the repatriation.''
   Members of the church group say the U.N. commission opposed the
refugees' return because Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani
doesn't want them back.
   The Salvadoran armed forces say the leftist guerrillas of the
Farabundo Marti National Liberation front have converted Honduran
refugee camps into retreats for rebels and their families,
providing sanctuaries for rest from combat fatigue and recuperation
from injuries.
   The U.S. government, which has backed the Salvadoran government
against the Marxist insurgents, considers refugees to be rebel
sympathizers.
   Eugenio Castro, a spokesmen for the Salvadoran Foreign Ministry,
denied the church group's charge. ``The Salvadoran government has
demonstrated its willingness to receive refugees and will do it,''
he said.
   Blumenthal said the church group just wanted to politicize the
repatriation. The organization ``has made a series of stupid moves
and blocked the relocation of the Salvadorans,'' he said.
   Salvadoran Interior Secretary Enrique Ortiz Colindres said the
10,800 refugees remaining in Honduran camps will be repatriated
within two weeks.

   Maoist guerrillas shot to death an
Education Ministry official and his nephew in an Andean village,
police said Wednesday.
   The two were shot in Acobamba, 185 miles east of Lima, on
Monday. It took two days because of the remoteness of the village
for word of the killings to reach Huancayo, authorities said.
   Police said five rebels gunned down Jose Melgar, a local
education supervisor, and his nephew. The victims, who had been
visiting schools in the area, were members of the governing Aprista
party of President Alan Garcia.
   The guerrillas of the Shining Path movement have been battling
nine years to overthrow Peru's elected government. The group has
stepped up attacks recently to sabotage nationwide municipal
elections scheduled for Nov. 12.
   The government says about 15,000 people have died in rebel
violence since 1980.

<TEXT>
   France on Wednesday offered an emergency plan
supplying Poland's Solidarity-led government with nearly $645
million in aid, and Japan agreed to let Warsaw extend repayments on
nearly $400 million in loans.
   In addition, West Germany intends to offer more than $1 billion
in aid to Poland when Chancellor Helmut Kohl visits that country in
November, The New York Times reported.
   The aid plans were announced on a day of partisan debate in the
U.S. Congress over how much aid to provide Poland and Hungary,
which is also undergoing democratic reform.
   The French aid came at the urging of President Francois
Mitterrand. In a speech Wednesday to the European Parliament, he
also called on the West to take steps to help Eastern European
nations struggling to rebuild their economies after decades of
communist rule.
   His plan to help Poland would provide money over three years.
   It would create an investment fund, partly provided by financial
institutions, of $145 million to help modernize the Polish economy,
said a statement issued by the presidential palace.
   Another $322 million in commercial credits would be added to the
$161 million France had already decided to provide Poland this
year, the statement said.
   The plan also envisions a $14.5 million fund for technical
assistance.
   His proposals for Eastern Europe, outlined in the Parliament's
headquarters in Strasbourg, included a European Bank to finance
development projects and a European Foundation to train managers.
   The Japanese offer came in an agreement that lets Poland extend
its debt repayment schedule for about $396.5 million in loans, the
Foreign Ministry in Tokyo said Wednesday.
   A ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Poland's debts to Japan, which had been due Dec. 31, 1988, included
$336.6 million of export insurance paid by Japan to cover Poland's
failure to pay for its imports and $59.9 million in loans extended
by the Japan Export-Import Bank.
   Under the agreement, Poland will repay the debts and interest
over five years after a five-year grace period, the official said.
   The Times report in Thursday's editions quoted unidentified West
German officials as saying Kohl would arrive in Poland on Nov. 9
with an offer of more than $1 billion in aid to help Poland rebuild
its economy. It gave no details.
   In Washington, Republican and Democratic senators clashed
Wednesday on the magnitude of U.S. aid to Poland and Hungary.
   Democrats said President Bush should commit more money, but
Republicans counterattacked.
   ``When asked for dramatic new steps, the administration takes a
wait and see attitude,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.
   ``We have to be very careful and pragmatic about what we propose
to do,'' said Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas. ``There
should not be a contest about how much money we can drag out of the
U.S. Treasury.''
   Under pressure to do more, Bush has expanded his aid proposal to
its current level of $451 million over three years.
   However, the House last week voted for an $840 million package
of grants and loans for the two countries.
   Senate Democrats are seeking passage of a proposal to authorize
a total $989 million in grants and loans over three years.

<TEXT>
   Unidentified gunmen killed 26 people
and six policemen died in a landmine blast in separate incidents in
Sri Lanka, police said Wednesday.
   All the deaths were reported in the previous 24 hours and
occurred in central and southern Sri Lanka, where Sinhalese
radicals from the People's Liberation Front are fighting the
government.
   Police officials in Kandy, 55 miles northeast of Colombo, said
the bodies of 24 Sinhalese men, women and children were discovered
Wednesday in nearby Katugastota. The officials, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said they were killed in a raid Tuesday.
   Opposition politicians and human rights activists have blamed
government forces or pro-government vigilante groups for similar
killings. The government has repeatedly denied the charges of
retribution against suspected members of the People's Liberation
Front.
   Police blamed Sinhalese radicals for the slayings Tuesday of a
Buddhist monk and a Sinhalese school principal in Kandy.
   They also blamed the radicals for an attack Wednesday in which
six police officers were killed when the vehicle they were riding
in was hit by a mine in the central city of Baddula.
   The radicals accuse the government of making too many
concessions to the Tamil minority in the northeast. Police say
about 5,000 people have died in violence sponsored by the Sinhalese
radicals since the government and Tamils agreed to a peace plan in
1987.
   The Tamil insurrection began in 1983 and has left at least
11,000 dead, including 1,100 Indian soldiers who were deployed here
as a peacekeeping force as part of the 1987 pact with the Tamils.
   Tamils make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people. They
accuse Sinhalese of discriminating against them in jobs and
education.

   Zsa Zsa Gabor, accustomed to a life of
entertainment and elegant gowns, can expect a lonely cell and a
cotton shift or pantsuit if she chooses to serve her 72-hour jail
term at the county women's jail.
   But she would get color television.
   Under the sentence handed down Tuesday by Beverly Hills
Municipal Court Judge Charles G. Rubin, the convicted cop-slapper
may choose any jail in Los Angeles County to complete her 72-hour
stay behind bars before Dec. 29.
   Miss Gabor said she was still upset about the sentence Wednesday.
   In a brief telephone interview with The Associated Press, Miss
Gabor said she was afraid of most reporters because one demanded to
see the age listed on her driver's license.
   ``I don't know why you all do this to me,'' she declared. ``I
was just trying to save the women of America,'' she said before
hanging up abruptly. The actress was in the middle of taping an
interview for the television program ``A Current Affair.''
   In that interview, Miss Gabor said the judge and prosecutor Ira
Reiner enjoyed the trial's circus-like publicity more than she did.
   ``They loved it. They milked it. I don't need it,'' she said.
``I'm a rich woman. I don't need these people, they needed me.''
   A jury convicted Miss Gabor on Sept. 29 of misdemeanor charges
of battery on a police officer, driving without a valid driver's
license and having an open container of alcohol in her car. The
former Hungarian beauty queen, believed to be in her mid-60s, was
acquitted of failing to obey an officer.
   The judge ordered also Miss Gabor to pay $12,937.50 in fines and
restitution and to perform 120 hours of community service in a
women's homeless shelter, where she may not talk about her case or
give interviews.
   ``It's nothing for me,'' she said of the community service
during the television interview. ``I do much more a year. I love
it.''
   The judge said her unrepentant attitude contributed to the
sentence. She faced a maximum of 18 months in jail.
   Miss Gabor also was ordered to be interviewed by a psychiatrist
and refrain from driving until she gets her real age on her
driver's license. During the trial, Miss Gabor claimed the license
was stolen and altered by someone else.
   ``Maybe I should have my head examined. He's right,'' Miss Gabor
told ``A Current Affair.'' ``If I tried to fight City Hall and the
Beverly Hills police, a woman should have her head examined.''
   Sybil Brand Institute, the county's jail for women, is probably
the institution best equipped to deal with a celebrity inmate such
as Miss Gabor, Sheriff Sherman Block said Wednesday.
   ``She will receive absolutely no special privileges here,'' said
Lt. Joe Surgent, in charge of operations for Sybil Brand, which has
an estimated 2,000 inmates.
   Such personalities as Patty Hearst have been held at Sybil Brand
and Cynthia Garvey, ex-wife of former baseball player Steve Garvey,
recently spent a night there for contempt in a child-custody
dispute.
   ``Anytime we have an inmate who is recognizable, we separate
them from the general population for their own safety,'' Surgent
said. ``People with that kind of notoriety can be preyed upon.''
   Miss Gabor would be alone when she eats, showers and even
watches television, except for when a deputy escorts her from her
cell to the shower area, he said.
   Block called Miss Gabor's ability to choose where she will serve
her sentence ``a perversion of the system.''
   If she chooses Sybil Brand, Miss Gabor will be booked, searched
and ordered to trade her clothes for a jail uniform, like any other
inmate, Surgent said Wednesday. She would be given an 8-by-10 foot
concrete jail cell furnished with a bed, sink and toilet, he said.

government records show.
   Ironically, the secret test was done as part of an internal
investigation into troubling discrepancies in the amount of tritium
shipped from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory at Oak Ridge, Tenn.,
to commercial buyers in recent years.
   Tritium supplies are classified by the government. The material
is produced in Energy Department reactors in South Carolina for use
in nuclear warheads, although small amounts are sold to domestic
and foreign companies. Commercial uses include the manufacture of
luminous lights and biological and energy research.
   No acceptable explanation could be found for the tritium lost in
the test shipment last year, according to an Oak Ridge report
released Wednesday by the Energy Department in response to a
Freedom of Information Act request by The Associated Press.

   Two days before President Bush attends a
multinational meeting with Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega, the
administration is renewing a trade embargo against that country and
complaining to the Soviets that Ortega is exporting revolution.
   Bush also refused to sign a joint pro-democracy statement from
the ``Summit of the Americas'' in Costa Rica if Ortega's name was
on it, administration and Costa Rican officials said Wednesday.
   Plans were subsequently abandoned for such a communique on
general themes of democracy and environment, which had been
proposed by the host government for the meeting of hemispheric
leaders being held Friday and Saturday.
   ``The U.S. objected to signing any statement with Daniel
Ortega,'' said one senior administration official, who added that
other countries had also raised concerns about the document's
contents.

   More children suffering from AIDS will soon be
allowed to get AZT, the only government-approved anti-AIDS drug,
which now comes in the form of a new strawberry-flavored syrup,
federal sources say.
   The Food and Drug Administration will allow wider distribution
of AZT to children under age 13, according to sources at the
Department of Health and Human Services, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan was to announce the program today.
   The drug will be available under what the FDA calls a
``Treatment IND,'' which allows widespread distribution of a drug
that appears to be promising on the basis of clinical trials.

   Critic and novelist Mary McCarthy, whose ``ice
clear'' observations of politics and literature placed her among
America's literary giants, has died. She was 77.
   Miss McCarthy died of cancer Wednesday at New York Hospital,
said Dixie Sheridan, spokeswoman for the author's alma mater,
Vassar College in Poughkeepsie.
   Called ``our first lady of letters'' by Norman Mailer, Miss
McCarthy first made her mark among the brawling New York
intellectuals of the 1930s, writing scathing literary and
theatrical reviews for ``The Nation'' and ``Partisan Review.''
   She reached a wider audience in 1963 with her spicy best-selling
novel ``The Group,'' chronicling the lives of eight women who
graduated from college in the 1930s.

   President Bush called for legislation Thursday
that would allow dangerous pesticides to be taken off the market
more quickly, saying the government's ability to ensure a safe food
supply was being called into question.
   But his proposed changes in how pesticides and other chemicals
on foods are regulated were criticized immediately by
environmentalists and some members of Congress who said provisions
of the president's plan could instead make foods less safe.
   While Bush's proposal to streamline regulation was praised,
critics said other provisions of his plan would ease the risk
levels used to determine if a pesticide is to be banned and also
would have the government preempt state pesticide-control laws that
often are stronger than federal rules.
   The president, in announcing the proposed legislation, alluded
to widespread publicity earlier this year over the use of Alar on
apples and the government's inability to remove the cancer-causing
chemical from the market swiftly.

   The U.S. economy shrugged off Hurricane Hugo
and the poorest trade performance in six years to grow at a
moderate 2.5 percent annual rate from July through September, the
Commerce Department reported Thursday.
   The department said that the increase in the gross national
product, the country's total output of goods and services, was
accompanied by a dramatic slowing of the inflation rate. A price
index tied to the GNP rose at an annual rate of 2.9 percent, the
slowest in three years, as both energy and food costs moderated.
   The combination of moderate growth and lower inflation was
hailed by the Bush administration, but many private economists said
the big deterioration in the trade deficit and a buildup of unsold
business inventories posed significant threats to the economy in
coming months.
   The stock market, reacting to the negative aspects of the GNP
report, turned down. The Dow Jones industrial average of 30 stocks
lost 39.55 point.

   Treasury Secretary Nicholas S. Brady said
Thursday that the Securities and Exchange Commission should have
the power to halt stock trading in market emergencies.
   Brady noted that SEC Chairman Richard C. Breeden said just a day
earlier that he doesn't want such authority.
   But the treasury secretary said the Bush administration backs
bills in Congress to strengthen the SEC in the belief that
government's initial response to market emergencies should come
``from a regulator with expertise and proximity to the markets.''
   Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee in support of the
legislation, Brady, who headed a government commission that
investigated Wall Street's 1987 crash, said the 190-point slide in
the Dow Jones industrial average on Oct. 13 had not altered his
belief in the soundness of the U.S. economy.

   Friday is another grim birthday for Terry
Anderson, his fifth in captivity since gunmen seized him after a
game of tennis that had been a brief respite from reporting
Lebanon's civil war. He will be 42.
   He has not held his daughter, born three months after the
morning he was kidnapped _ March 16, 1985, a Saturday. He probably
does not know both his father and brother died of cancer.
   The fate of Terry A. Anderson, journalist and non-combatant,
chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press, now
appears to be caught up in a power struggle between Shiite Moslem
radicals and moderates.
   He was kidnapped in Moslem west Beirut by Islamic Jihad, a group
loyal to Iran whose name means Islamic Holy War. His abductors
demand the release of 15 men imprisoned in Kuwait for bombing the
U.S. and French embassies in 1983.

   Grain bins are filling with the fall
harvest and many farmers are smiling again, but drought still
clings to about a third of the nation.
   ``It's not as bad this year,'' said Norton Strommen, chief
meteorologist of the U.S. Agriculture Department. ``This year we
got very timely rains ... and yields are up. But it was only
because of the timing and the distribution of the rains, combined
with the temperature patterns that allowed us to get good crops.''
   Nationwide, producers are seeing yield increases of up to 30
percent over last year, Strommen said. Farmers also planted more
acreage than in 1988.
   But farmers like Verdun Schauer are counting up losses for the
second straight year.
   ``I've never seen a failure two years in a row, but there are no
rules against it, I guess,'' said Schauer, 49, who abandoned about
half the 1,500 acres of barley and wheat this year on his farm 25
miles east of Bismarck.
   This year's drought stretches from parts of Illinois through the
Dakotas and parts of Kansas and Nebraska, Srommen said. Soil
moisture is 4 inches to 10 inches short in the most severely
stricken areas of northern Iowa, south-central Minnesota and the
upper Plains, he said.

   Israeli manufacturers have filed a police

   A spokesman for the Israeli Manufacturers' Association said
Thursday the group has asked police to investigate the Al Ghazel

   ``We asked police to investigate why they are allowed to
distribute the flag in this way. It should be considered against

   The Palestinian flag is illegal in Israel and the occupied

   The final date of reckoning may be more than
five months away, but many people are checking up now on the
income-tax bill they expect to owe Uncle Sam for 1989.
   Their purpose is simple: To avoid facing a penalty for
underpayment of estimated and withholding taxes when they file
their returns for the year.
   Ordinarily this isn't a big worry for people who get most or all
of their income from wages or salaries. The withholding tax
collected from each paycheck covers what they will owe.
   In fact, most individual tax returns that are filed each year
carry claims for refunds.
   But the penalty still lurks as a potential pitfall for anyone,
wealthy or not, who for one reason or another gets down to the
bottom line of the tax form with a significant unpaid balance.
   ``Withholding may not cover your tax,'' warns the J.K. Lasser
Institute in its annual guide ``Your Income Tax.''
   ``The withholding tax rate may be below your actual tax rate
when considering other income such as interest, dividends, business
income and capital gains.''
   There are specific rules to determine who must pay a penalty,
and who doesn't have to, when there is a balance owed to the
Internal Revenue Service at the end of a year.
   You are generally in the clear if your withholding, and any
estimated payments made on schedule, add up to at least 90 percent
of the tax owed, or if the shortfall is less than $500.
   Alternatively, no penalty is assessed if your payments made in
1989 at least equal the final amount of tax you owed for 1988,
provided you filed a 1988 return that covered a 12-month period.
   Similarly, you are exempt if you had no tax liability for 1988
and were living in the United States throughout that year.
   That gives you several yardsticks to use on your likely 1989 tax
bill, which should be relatively easy to estimate this late in the
year.
   The ``research'' may require nothing more than checking the
amount of year-to-date withholding from your latest paycheck stub
against the total tax on your return for last year.
   But suppose your payments still don't look as though they will
measure up. If you should have been making estimated payments, it
is probably too late to eliminate a penalty with an increased
quarterly payment for the last installment of the year, due in
January.
   There is another way to approach this problem, however. You can
narrow or close the gap by asking an employer to take increased
withholding taxes out of your last few paychecks of the year.
   Unlike quarterly estimated taxes, withholding tax is treated as
though it were paid in a steady stream through the year, unless you
choose to establish otherwise.
   ``Thus,'' notes the Research Institute of America, an
organization that collects and publishes tax information, ``if an
employee asks his employer to withhold extra large amounts for the
rest of the year, the penalty can be retroactively eliminated.''

   At a quickening pace, scientists are discovering

   In the 1980s, biologists uncovered the genetic causes of such
perplexing ailments as cystic fibrosis. In the '90s, they will turn
their attention to the genetics of human behavior.
   In human genes, the basic units of heredity, scientists may find
the roots of such complex disorders as manic-depressive illness and
schizophrenia. Unlike simpler ailments studied so far, these are
the result of more than one genetic malfunction.
   It will take more than 10 years to understand ``the molecular
nature of our emotional life,'' said Philip Leder, chairman of the
genetics department at Harvard Medical School. But understanding of
some behavioral disorders should come by the year 2000, he said.
   ``We know a number of these run in families,'' he said. ``We
don't know what genes are involved in that process. They haven't
been identified yet. But there is the possibility that with gene
mapping we will be able to sort them out.''
   Gene mapping is the process of sorting through human chromosomes
to find the particular genes related to a particular disorder.
   Heart disease and cancer, the nation's two leading killers, are
also caused in part by multiple genetic abnormalities. They, too,
may begin to yield to the rapidly expanding capabilities of
geneticists, Leder said.
   ``There are very few diseases that afflict man or mouse that are
not genetic in one way or another,'' Leder said recently at a
gathering of geneticists at the Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor,
Maine.
   By the end of the 1990s, researchers should be closer to a
complete, chemical-by-chemical understanding of some of these
ailments, said Leder, one of the inventors of the genetically
engineered mouse that became, in April 1988, the first animal to be
patented.
   David Baltimore, a Nobel laureate at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, shares Leder's optimistic view of the next decade.
   ``The fast pace of molecular biology shows no sign of slowing
down,'' he wrote recently.
   Baltimore said studies of the central nervous system are showing
that nerve cells respond to signals in nearly the same way that
kidney cells respond to hormones or skin cells respond to growth
factors.
   ``I think this will be a tremendously exciting field in the next
10 years, one that will not only stimulate discoveries in neurology
and lead to new treatments for Alzheimer's disease and other
degenerative brain diseases but also greatly enrich the fields of
psychiatry and psychology,'' he wrote.
   The growing biotechnology industry, where basic research is
beginning to be translated into products, has also issued glowing
predictions for the 1990s.
   The industry's total sales exceeded $2 billion last year. That
is expected to climb to $50 billion by the turn of the century,
according to an industry survey by the Ernst and Young High
Technology Group in New York.
   One of the most notable efforts of the coming decade is the
so-called Human Genome Project, a $3 billion program to determine
the genetic code, or sequence, of all the estimated 50,000 to
100,000 genes that govern human hereditary characteristics. The
complete set of genes is called the genome (pronounced JEE-nome).
   The project is being coordinated by the National Center for
Human Genome Research, part of the National Institutes of Health in
Bethesda, Md.
   The center's director, James Watson, one of the discoverers of
the double helix of DNA, predicts the project can be completed in
10 to 15 years.
   That will vastly simplify the process of understanding the
function of individual genes and linking certain genes to disease.
   Finding disease genes does not immediately lead to a cure for
the disease. Researchers must discover how to correct the defective
genes _ which can be a difficult task. But finding the disease
genes is a necessary first step in the process of curing disease.
   So-called gene therapy, in which defective genes can be replaced
with normal genes, was a goal of genetics during much of the past
decade, but it has remained elusive.
   Many scientists believe, however, that the first steps toward
gene therapy will be taken during the next decade, and some
experiments are likely to be at least partly successful.
   The leading method will use viruses engineered in the laboratory
to insert corrective genes into cells as they infect them. The
first trials of the feasibility of this method have just begun at
the National Institutes of Health.
   Some of the difficult questions biologists will have to answer
in the 1990s will be asked outside the laboratory, Leder said.
   Recent events suggest that continuing social concerns over
animal rights could impede biological research, he said.
   In April, for example, demonstrators pounded on windows and
broke open a door at the National Institutes of Health, and 37 were
arrested. ``We're protesting the murders of millions of animals,''
they said.
   In June, the city council in Cambridge, Mass., home to Harvard
and MIT, adopted animal rights legislation that will allow a
commissioner to make unannounced lab visits and fine researchers
$300 a day for violations.
   ``There are those who feel the life of a rat is as important as
the life of a child,'' said Leder. ``We have to be prepared to make
people understand that genetics is another very powerful tool in
the armamentarium we have against disease.''

<HEAD>Proposed Liturgical Texts Take Gender Out of Trinity</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Episcopal Church is exploring the frontier
of de-sexed liturgical language with proposed text changes that
will cheer some churchgoers but may upset others in the pews.
   Among the changes included in the alternative texts under study
is substituting ``God who creates, redeems and inspires'' for
``Father, Son and Holy Spirit.''
   The Supplemental Liturgical Texts, now being experimented with
in a few hundred parishes, also offer other alternatives to
referring to God and Jesus in masculine terms such as ``Lord'' and
add prayers that highlight the role of women in religion.
   ``We are trying to answer the need of people throughout the
country who feel left out, women in particular who feel the liturgy
is male-oriented,'' said Bishop Vincent Pettit, chairman of the
church's Standing Liturgical Commission.
   But while some church leaders welcome the new texts as offering
a broader vision of God, others predict the radical changes in
church services will unsettle many of the denomination's 2.5
million members.
   ``Are you going to provide flak vests with the book?'' Bishop
Robert Witcher of the Diocese of Long Island in New York asked the
commission when the texts were recently presented to the House of
Bishops.
   The church's General Convention of 1985 required the liturgical
commission to develop inclusive language liturgies _ liturgies that
do not refer to God in exclusively masculine terms.
   In 1988, the General Convention voted that the supplemental
services be made available for testing in parishes no later than
this Advent following a year of consultation between the liturgical
commission and the House of Bishops' Theology Committee.
   The Rev. Sarah Motley, coordinator of the liturgical
commission's committee on inclusive language in the liturgy,
estimates that 200 to 800 of the church's approximately 7,400
parishes would experiment with the services in ``Prayer Book
Studies 30-Supplemental Liturgical Texts.''
   After the texts are evaluated in the parishes, the commission
will propose supplemental liturgical texts to the 1991 Diocesan
Convention.
   The change Ms. Motley refers to as ``in many ways the most
difficult frontier'' is the proposed alternative language for the
traditional terms for the three divine persons in one God that make
up the Christian Trinity _ the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.
   For example, in The Book of Common Prayer, the ``Gloria Patri''
recited in Morning Prayer is: ``Glory to the Father, and to the
Son, and to the Holy Spirit: as it was in the beginning, is now,
and will be forever.'' The alternative offered by the supplemental
texts is: ``Honor and Glory to the holy and undivided Trinity, God
who creates, redeems and inspires: One in Three and Three in One,
for ever and ever.''
   Other options offered by the supplemental texts include several
instances where phrases in the prayer book are altered to provide
gender-neutral terms for Jesus and God. In one part of the Holy
Eucharist, for example, the supplemental texts offer the prayer
``Blessed is the one who comes in the name of our God'' as an
alternative to ``Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the
Lord.''
   The supplemental texts are ``long overdue,'' said Marjorie
Christie, head of the Episcopal Women's Caucus. ``The ability to
obliterate the totally masculine words from our worship time is a
way we are able to broaden our vision of God,'' she said.
   Pettit said it is helpful for churchgoers to pray to a personal
God, but they have to be careful not to take masculine terms
literally.
   ``God is not male or female,'' he said.
   While the supplemental texts do not advocate deleting all
masculine references to God, they also offer feminine imagery not
in the current prayer book.
   Instead of ending the evening worship service asking for the
blessing of the ``Lord,'' the supplemental texts offer the
following alternative: ``May the blessing of the God of Abraham and
Sarah, and of Jesus Christ born of our sister Mary, and of the Holy
Spirit, who broods over the world as a mother over her children, be
upon you and remain with you always.''
   The texts already have drawn criticism.
   ``I think the result is going to be catastrophic,'' said the
Rev. Jerome Politzer, president of the Prayer Book Society in
America, a group of conservative Episcopalians who are opposed to
the 1979 revisions to the 1928 Book of Common Prayer.
   Politzer said there is nothing ``universal, aesthetic or
religious'' about the changes in the supplemental texts and charged
they amount to a new prayer book.
   ``This is heresy, and should be rejected,'' Politzer said.
   Pettit said even if the 1991 General Convention approved the
supplemental texts for use in parishes as an option in addition to
the prayer book, they would not be allowed to be published within
the Book of Common Prayer.
   ``We're looking 20 years down the road to prayer book
revision,'' he said.
   But advocates for inclusive language hope one day the prayer
book will be revised to reflect their concerns.
   ``Yes, it will be uncomfortable, because explorations are
uncomfortable, but it may bring us closer to the God who calls
us,'' said Ms. Motley. ``It's the old question: Do people go to
church to be comforted, or to be challenged?''

   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Religious television is most popular in a
city better known for politics than religion, and unpopular in the
city that is home to the headquarters of the Mormon Church,
according to a new study.
   Stephen Winzenburg, a communications professor at Grand View
College, said his analysis of A.C. Nielsen ratings revealed that 23
percent of household viewers in Washington watch religious
programming, while just 1.4 percent of Salt Lake City residents
tune in devotional shows.
   In his analysis of the top 100 television markets, the 10 cities
with the highest viewing levels of religious television were
Washington, Dallas, Atlanta, Houston, Sioux Falls, S.D.,
Birmingham, Ala., Nashville and Chattanooga, Tenn., Jackson, Miss.,
and Detroit.
   About 10 percent of the population in the average city watches
religious television, Winzenburg said.

   The Rev. Margaret Towner, the first woman
in the United States to enter the Presbyterian clergy, is stepping
down from the pulpit some 33 years after her ordination made
history.
   Ms. Towner, 64, preached her last sermon on Oct. 22 to the
congregations of the Kettle Moraine Parish she has served since
1973. She plans to retire in Florida.
   Ms. Towner, who was ordained in 1956, said she will continue to
work on two national committees of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)
and will be in the pulpit occasionally after her retirement.
   Ms. Towner moved a short time after her ordination to Kalamazoo,
Mich., where she was an associate pastor for 12 years before moving
to the Kettle Moraine Parish. She was one of three pastors serving
six small congregations with a total of about 630 members.

   Some American Jewish organizations have
expressed concern about a proposed statement by three Roman
Catholic archbishops calling upon Israel to negotiate with
Palestinians over ``territory and sovereignty.''
   The Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith said the statement
drafted by Cardinal John O'Connor of New York, Archbishop Roger
Mahony of Los Angeles and Archbishop William Keeler of Baltimore in
effect calls for a Palestinian state.
   ``Hope for progress rests on getting the parties together
without predetermined results,'' the league said. ``To call for a
state forecloses options of which there are many, and injects a
proposal into the equation that Israel and the U.S. oppose.''
   A statement from the Synagogue Council of America said the
bishops' proposal ``prejudges what can only be achieved through the
process of negotiations, which is the domain of the political
entities rather than religious bodies.''
   Rabbi Alexander M. Schindler, president of the Union of American
Hebrew Congregations, the central body of Reform Judaism in North
America, also said the issue of Palestinian territorial and
political sovereignty ``should be left to the negotiating parties
themselves.''
   The bishops' statement, ``Toward Peace in the Middle East:
Problems and Principles,'' will be presented to the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops' fall meeting Nov. 6-9 in Baltimore.

   Thomas Powers oversees the nation's
smallest state prison population like a businessman, spreading
responsibility among his staff and employing what he likes to call
``MBWA'' _ management by wandering around.
   ``We have a product, and our product is people,'' said Powers,
32. ``We've got to do a pretty good job of making them better
people.''
   The 6-foot-4, 245-pound Powers tours each cell block twice a
week and meets with 20 to 25 prisoners a week to discuss their
problems. ``It gives the inmates the opportunity to know that from
the top down, we're here to help them and not punish them.''
   Robert Cartledge, a guard for seven years, called him a ``new
generation'' warden. ``He's more of a hands-on guy. He's a lot
closer with the inmates.''
   ``Cool guy,'' said Laverne ``Charley'' Fasthorse, who's doing
three years for burglary. ``He's a Christian you know. He's a good
man. Tom participates with the people. I mean I'm on his basketball
team.''
   Powers became warden a year ago of a prison with cell blocks as
new as 1987 and as old as 1915, with an average population of 515 _
one to a cell.
   In September, the U.S. Justice Department listed the
penitentiary as the nation's smallest _ 456 inmates, down from 466
in 1988 _ and one of two states with a drop in prison population.
The other was Tennessee.
   And while the national recidivism rate is 50 percent to 60
percent, Powers estimated only about 45 percent to 50 percent of
North Dakota prisoners make a return trip, and said, ``I think a
realistic goal is 33 percent.''
   While acknowledging that some prisons _ ``crazy places,''
overcrowded and rife with related problems _ are beyond any
warden's help, he said, ``It would be theultimate challenge'' to
run one.
   Powers credits his staff for much of his success and believes
that with a good staff, the programs and the type of rapport he has
built with inmates at the North Dakota State Penitentiary could be
successful at larger prisons.
   ``I ran a 100-bed prison and was told I couldn't do those things
in a 250-bed prison. I ran a 250-bed prison and was told I couldn't
do it in a 500-bed prison. Although I'm content now, I might want
to move on to a bigger penitentiary in the federal system and do
what we're doing here.''
   A native of Syracuse, N.Y., Powers grew up in Pennsylvania and
graduated from Villanova University, majoring in sociology and
criminal justice. After he attended the Pennsylvania Department of
Corrections Training Academy, he became a deputy warden of the
Cumberland County Prison in Carlisle, Pa., and at age 27 became the
warden at the Bradford County Prison in Towanda, Pa.
   He supports President Bush's call for the death penalty for
heinous crimes and drug kingpins _ ``I think it needs to be
stringent and narrow in scope.'' _ but believes America needs more
minimum-security prisons and halfway houses to keep people
convicted of lesser crimes separate from hard-core criminals.
   ``I think in this business, there is a degree of overkill,'' he
said. ``Anytime you take an individual out of their home
environment and they can't see their family, you're going to have
an impact.''
   ``We use the family to our benefit. The family is too often
overlooked in this business.''
   Where possible, criminals should be imprisoned close to their
families and communities, and should participate in work-release
programs that would benefit the community, he said. ``My philosophy
is that inmates have taken from society and they have to give
something back.''
   He acknowledges, however, that ``there are 10 percent of the
people in this business who you will never reach.''
   Ninety-two percent of North Dakota prisoners are employed or
enrolled in some educational program. Eighty-five percent are in
treatment programs for alcohol or drug, the root of most of the
crimes, Powers said. ``We've made treatment the central focus of
our facility.''
   The North Dakota prison houses minimum- and maximum-security
inmates. ``Property offenders probably are the biggest majority,
and then sex offenders, and then those who have committed crimes
against people,'' he said. ``We seem to be seeing more sex
offenders _ that seems to be more of a trend over the last five
years.
   ``We get them from all over the country, some just passing
through, some boarding for the federal prison system.''
   The visiting room resembles a school cafeteria, with rules
posted at the front, and no glass windows to separate inmates from
visitors. Escape attempts are rare, and one attempt that was made
recently ended when the inmate gave up a hand-made gun peacefully
after a talk with the chief security officer.
   ``That was no accident. The fact that that inmate gave him the
gun shows he knew that inmate well,'' Powers said.
   ``There are a lot of wardens who like the fact that we have a
manageable population. I think we have a lot of potential here for
a national model. I think North Dakota is a kept secret.''

<HEAD>GAO Says Now Isn't Time to Ease Bank Standards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Now isn't the time, less than 2{ months after
taxpayers bailed out the savings and loan industry, to consider
easing capital standards for commercial banks, the General
Accounting Office says.
   ``In the aftermath of the thrift disaster, neither the public
nor the banks should be given a signal by the regulators that lower
capital levels are acceptable,'' said Harry S. Havens, assistant
comptroller general.
   Testifying Wednesday before the Senate Banking Committee, Havens
inserted the GAO, Congress' auditing and investigative agency, into
a contentious dispute between bank regulators over the government's
key financial standard ensuring the safety of the nation's 13,000
commercial banks.
   Comptroller of the Currency Robert L. Clarke, a Treasury
Department official who regulates nationally chartered banks, is
proposing a new capital standard that the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., which insures deposits at both state and national banks,
says is too low.
   Capital, representing the investment of bank stockholders,
serves as a cushion, absorbing losses before federal deposit
insurance kicks in. Financial institutions with low capital levels
are more inclined to make risky investments because their owners
have less to lose. The crisis in the S&amp;L industry was blamed in
part on regulatory moves in the early 1980s to relax capital rules.
   Both the FDIC and Clarke's office have agreed to a risk-adjusted
standard starting in 1991, which would apply a more lenient test to
banks holding safer investments such as home mortgages and
government securities. However, they disagree over a backup
standard known as a ``leverage ratio.''
   Clarke is proposing, but has not yet implemented, a 3 percent
leverage ratio. FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman is pushing for
more than that, preferably 6 percent.
   He maintains that Clarke's proposal would permit nearly 10,000
banks to reduce their capital by a total of $8 billion. Clarke,
however, said Seidman's proposal would negate the beneficial
effects of risk-adjustments.
   ``Now is not the time to be reducing capital standards. The
banking business is an increasingly volatile one,'' Seidman said,
noting bank problems in real estate lending and in loans to Third
World countries.
   Havens of the GAO agreed, saying, ``Adequate capitalization is
the first line of defense of any financial institution. Any
proposal that could yield a reduction in that capitalization should
be viewed with great caution.''
   The disagreement among regulators raises the prospect that more
lenient standards will apply to the 4,250 national banks regulated
by Clarke than to the 7,650 state banks for which Seidman writes
the capital rules.
   Manuel H. Johnson, vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board,
which sets the capital standards for about 1,100 state banks that
are members of its system, said the Fed has not yet taken a formal
position on the issue but believes the regulations should be
uniform for all banks.
   ``If we're not able to agree, I think Congress will have to get
in and decide it for us,'' Seidman said.
   Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., chairman of the Senate Banking
Committee, declined to reveal a position, saying he expected the
regulators would be able to reach a consensus.

<HEAD>Congressional Leader Urges Caution on Takeovers by Japanese Banks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the House Banking Committee
has urged federal officials to use caution in permitting foreign
takeovers of banks.
   Rep. Henry Gonzalez, D-Texas, said Wednesday that foreign
interests control an estimated 21 percent of the U.S. banking
market. Financial experts say Japanese and other foreign banks are
poised to purchase additional U.S. banks.
   ``Before this happens, before it is too late, I would ask the
(Federal Reserve) to be cautious in permitting such takeovers
before we fully understand how our economy is affected by increased
foreign ownsership of U.S. banks and financial services firms,''
the banking chairman said.
   Gonzalez' statement was prepared for a hearing by his
Subcommittee on Domestic Monetary Policy. Alan Greenspan, chairman
of the Fed's board of governors, was the chief witnesss for the
hearing, called to discuss the Fed's traditional independence.
   Gonzalez said he was concerned the Fed has not been as sensitive
as some foreign competitors in enforcing the requirement that
foreign banks have the same opportunities as U.S. banks, with some
special regulations and requirements for the foreign banks.
   ``It is important that we have a better understanding of how
foreign banks affect the profitability of domestic banks as well as
how such presence affects the availability of credit to domestic
corporations and individuals,'' he said.
   In recent years, cash-rich Japanese banks have made significant
inroads in the U.S. market by adding and expanding their own branch
offices here, or buying into established financial units, from
banking to securities operations. In the largest such transaction
yet, Japan's Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank _ the world's biggest bank _
agreed last month to acquire a 60 percent interest in CIT Group,
the financial services unit of Manufacturers Hanover Corp., for
about $1.4 billion.
   Other recent major transactions have included the $750 million
acquisition of Union Bank by California First Bank last year and
Daiwa Bank Ltd.'s agreement to acquire the U.S. commercial banking
operations of Britain's Lloyds Bank PLC for about $200 million.
   Japanese-owned banks now reportedly account for nearly 20
percent of the banking business in California, while eight of the
10 largest foreign bank branches in New York are part of Japanese
banks.
   Japanese institutions make about 5 percent of all U.S. loans and
hold about 9 percent of U.S. banking assets, according to industry
estimates, and the figures are expected to grow in the next 18
months as Japanese banks try to remain competitive with each other.

<HEAD>Broadcasters, Cable Systems Near Agreement on Channel Assignments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Broadcast and cable industry executives appear
close to ending their bitter fight over who gets the best channel
positions on viewers' televisions.
   The executives indicated at a Senate hearing that they intended
to stop their feud over what channels broadcast stations should get
on cable TV systems and give the Federal Communications Commission
a chance to adopt procedures to arbitrate such disputes.
   Such a cease-fire, which was proposed Wednesday by Sen. Daniel
Inouye, D-Hawaii, at a hearing of the Senate Commerce
communications subcommittee Inouye chairs, would clear the way for
a broadcast-cable agreement on new rules to determine which
stations cable systems must carry.
   The FCC had established ``must carry'' rules in 1965 that had
required cable systems to carry all or most local broadcast
signals, and mostly on their FCC-designated channels. But a court
struck down the rules in 1985 on constitutional ``free-speech''
grounds.
   Broadcasters have claimed that without the rules cable systems
have been dropping local stations or changing the channel positions
assigned by the FCC.
   Inouye's subcommittee has been working with the TV industry to
write new rules that will pass court scrutiny, but the
channel-positioning controversy has held up agreement.
   James Mooney, president of the National Cable Television
Association, told Inouye on Wednesday he was amenable to Inouye's
plan. National Association of Broadcasters President Edward O.
Fritts said he would be glad to present the proposal to his board
of directors, as did Preston Padden, president of the Association
of Independent Television Stations.
   Inouye said he believed must-carry legislation could be passed
before the end of this year, perhaps by attaching it to pending
legislation that would reimpose commercial advertising limits on
children's television shows.
   Broadcasters claim they are disadvantaged when a cable system
bumps them from their over-the-air channel positions. Often the
broadcasters get pushed to higher numbers on the TV dial, which
broadcasters call ``cable Siberia,'' and away from the most-watched
2-13 channel positions. Some cable-connected TVs don't receive
channels higher than 13.
   The FCC's must-carry rules required cable systems to carry all
or most of the local broadcast signals in their service area, and
VHF stations (2-13) ``on channel.''
   After the 1985 ruling, the FCC adopted new must-carry rules,
without any on-channel requirement, but the court struck those down
in 1987, finding that the FCC had not justified the requirements.

   A U.S. proposal to reform world agricultural trade
by phasing out farm supports, export subsidies and import tariffs
received a mixed reaction from negotiators at the 97-nation General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   A trade source said Wednesday the European Community and Japan
criticized the proposal as being too drastic, while countries such
as Canada and Australia which do not subsidize agriculture welcomed
the document.
   Third World nations relying on imports of farm produce voiced
concern that the plan might increase the price of these imports, he
added.
   Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Julius Katz described the
proposal as ``realistic'' and said it was essential to extend
GATT's free-trade principles to agriculture.
   The plan, unveiled in Washington on Tuesday, calls for the
abolition of export subsidies within five years and the phasing out
of national farm support measures that distort trade within 10
years.
   It also says import barriers such as quotas should be converted
into tariffs, and these should gradually be reduced over a 10-year
period.
   The U.S. proposal to reform world farm trade is the most
comprehensive to be put on the table so far in the GATT-sponsored
Uruguay round of trade negotiations, which close at the end of 1990.
   However, EC negotiator Rolf Moehler told the meeting in Geneva
that the proposal risked ``stopping the clock on agricultural
negotiations,'' the trade source said.
   Moehler said the EC was in favor of gradual, but not overnight,
reform.
   Officials in Brussels said the proposal would destroy the EC's
agricultural policy and said it did not form ``an adequate basis
for negotiation.''
   They accused the United States of disregarding an April
agreement that called for progressive and substantial reductions in
farm supports, but not for total elimination.
   More than half the EC's annual budget is spent on supporting
farmers through the Common Agricultural Policy.
   The United States has said that the cost of farm programs to the
industrial countries alone amounts to $165 billion a year, $130
billion of which is borne by consumers and taxpayers.
   The four-year Uruguay round is also trying to agree on new trade
rules on areas such as textiles, tropical products, copyright and
other intellectual property rights, and services like tourism and
transportation.

   Federal regulators have approved plans by the
New York Stock Exchange and Chicago Board Options Exchange to begin
trading a financial instrument known as a ``stock basket.''
   The Securities and Exchange Commission voted unanimously, 4-0,
Wednesday to approve trading in those two products as well as
allowing the Chicago-based Midwest Stock Exchange to establish an
after-hours, computerized trading session for transactions in
portfolios of securities.
   The New York product, to be known as the Exchange Stock
Portfolio, will allow large institutional investors, but not
individuals, to trade in ``baskets'' _ $5 million blocks of about
126,000 shares apiece _ of stocks reflecting the Standard &amp; Poor's
500 stock index.
   The Chicago product, also limited to institutional investors,
will permit trading in $1.6 million baskets based on the S&amp;P 100
Index and $1.73 million baskets based on the S&amp;P 500 Stock Price
Index.
   Both products were recommended in the wake of the October 1987
stock market crash as a means of reducing volatility in the markets
without cutting efficiency.
   The Chicago and New York stock baskets are different from two
hybrid financial instruments, developed earlier this year by the
Philadelphia Stock Exchange and the American Stock Exchange, also
known as stock baskets.
   Those ``baskets'' represented the S&amp;P Index itself rather than
the actual stocks that make up the index.
   For that reason, a federal appeals court in Chicago has ruled
the products are more like futures than securities and must be
regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
   The court ordered the Philadelphia and American exchanges, which
received permission to trade their products from the SEC, to cease
trading until they receive approval from the CFTC.
   On Monday, the court turned down an appeal of its ruling.
   In the third item approved at the SEC's first open meeting since
Richard C. Breeden took over as chairman two weeks ago, the Midwest
Stock Exchange will be able to start a secondary trading session
from 4:30 p.m. to 6 p.m. EST for the execution of stock portfolio
trades using a new automated Portfolio Trading System.
   There is still one vacancy on the five-member SEC. Breeden was
the numerical replacement for Commissioner Charles Cox. No one has
been nominated by President Bush to fill the numerical vacancy left
by formr Chairman David Ruder.

<HEAD>UAL Faces Labor Negotiations in Wake of Failed Buyout</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES WEBB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The failed pilot-management bid for UAL Corp. may
aggravate relations between the company and its unions, but a
machinist union official says his organization might be willing to
participate in a deal to help protect the parent of United Airlines
from an unwanted takeover.
   Machinist leaders celebrated the end of the bid, and union
flight attendants, who have been seeking a new contract for about
two years, were left disgruntled after the UAL board announced
Monday it would remain independent while directors examine
alternatives to the scrapped $6.75 billion offer.
   However, despite the machinists' opposition to the buyout, John
F. Peterpaul, a vice president of the union, told The New York
Times he would meet today with other machinist officials and
advisers to discuss ways of making UAL less vulnerable to a
takeover.
   ``This company will continue to be in jeopardy and we want to
see what we can do to help,'' he said.
   The Times also quoted a source as saying several Japanese banks
had contacted the union to see whether it might support an
alternative buyout proposal.
   The main union involved in the failed buyout bid, the Air Line
Pilots Association, planned to meet today in New York with
representatives of the flight attendants' union to try to revive
the failed plan, union sources told the Chicago Tribune.
   UAL management, however, will not be represented at the New York
meeting, the Tribune reported.
   ``Management is free to participate in a buyout bid, but as a
practical matter, they can't lead the charge,'' the newspaper
quoted an unidentified union source as saying.
   Management worked with the pilots during the effort to take over
the nation's second-largest airline, but it was unclear how the
relationship would weather the collapse of the deal earlier this
month, analysts said Wednesday.
   ``You've had crummy (labor) relations all along _ it certainly
wasn't made better by this deal,'' said Edward Starkman, an airline
analyst with PaineWebber Inc. in New York.
   ``It's going to have Mr. Wolf walking a fine line,'' Starkman
said of Stephen Wolf, UAL's chairman and the leader of the buyout
offer.
   The contract with the machinists union, United's largest
organized labor group representing more than 24,000 employees, is
open to negotiations beginning in November.
   Machinist spokesman Jim Conley said the union wants to proceed
with ``normal'' talks and does not expect increased difficulty
because of its view of the failed deal.
   The union will pursue wage and benefit increases and may also
seek to strengthen job protection language that currently allows
the machinists to extend their contract provisions for three years
in the event of a buyout, Conley said in a telephone interview from
Memphis, Tenn.
   The flight attendants, while negotiating to join the buyout
plan, had also balked at some concessions outlined in the proposal.
   Now they want an immediate resumption of the federal mediation
that was suspended in August due to the buyout speculation.
Resuming the talks could lead to a walkout if the negotiations are
as unsuccessful as they have been for the past two years, said Pat
Friend, spokeswoman for the Association of Flight Attendants in
Chicago.
   For their part in the buyout effort, the pilots agreed, among
other things, to accept a 7-year contract with a no-strike pledge
and to grant about $250 million in annual concessions.
   That contract is no longer valid. Some good-faith concessions,
such as flying four additional hours a month without pay, have been
in effect for about a month, but some pilots are calling for those
concessions to be rescinded.
   Calls to UAL and the pilots union for comment were not returned.
   The Air Line Pilots Association said it will continue to pursue
an employee ownership plan for UAL, but some analysts predicted it
would be some time before a new offer was presented by the union or
anyone else.
   ``One thing this board's clearly demonstrated is they're not
quickly moved into action to do anything on their own,'' said
Robert Decker, an airline analyst with Duff &amp; Phelps in Chicago.
``They'll follow that approach until someone emerges and forces
them to take action.''

<HEAD>RJR Deal Prompted Lawsuits, Review of Bond Risk</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-RJR Nabisco</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The RJR Nabisco Inc. buyout a year ago propelled
the conglomerate's high-grade bonds to the junk-bond basement,
prompting lawsuits and a reassessment of the risk of owning
corporate debt.
   But ironically, junk bonds sold a few months later by RJR
Nabisco's new owners to finance the record-breaking takeover are
considered ``quality'' junk issues in today's troubled high-yield
debt market.
   That $4 billion junk bond issue _ the largest-ever corporate
bond offering _ was a hit. Investors snapped up the securities when
they were sold in May.
   Analysts say the inherent value of RJR Nabisco brands, such as
Oreo cookies, Ritz crackers and Winston cigarettes, gave investors
confidence in the ability of the company to make money and sell
assets to reduce debt and repay the bonds.
   But RJR Nabisco's earlier experience with bondholders wasn't as
pleasant.
   Shortly after announcing the $24.53 billion leveraged buyout by
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. last October, the market price of
existing RJR Nabisco bonds plunged on news of the huge amount of
new debt the company would assume in the transaction. At the same
time, bond-rating agencies dropped their credit rating of RJR
Nabisco bonds to the low-grade, junk-bond category.
   Several major bondholders, including Metropolitan Life Insurance
Co., sued the company, contending they were treated as second-class
investors to RJR's shareholders, who reaped a bonanza when they
sold their shares.
   Met Life contends in its lawsuit, which is pending, that RJR
Nabisco recklessly quadrupled debt through the buyout. RJR Nabisco
also faces a class-action lawsuit from bondholders and a similar
suit from the insurance unit of ITT Corp.
   Met Life said news of the buyout slashed more than $1 billion in
market value from RJR Nabisco's bonds. The insurance company said
its own portfolio of about $340 million in RJR Nabisco bonds lost
$40 million in value.
   A tenet of corporate finance is that bondholders enjoy
precedence over shareholders, argues Met Life President John J.
Creedon.
   ``This basic concept of corporate priorities was turned upside
down by the RJR Nabisco leveraged buyout. Substantially all the
company's net worth was paid out to its shareholders and the
bondholders received nothing,'' Creedon said in a speech earlier
this year. ``The payment to shareholders was funded by enormous
levels of new debt.''
   Concern over plunging bond prices resulting from the RJR Nabisco
deal and other takeovers at the time brought new awareness of
``event risk,'' or corporate restructurings that deteriorate the
value of a company's securities.
   No longer could it be presumed that high-grade corporate bonds
were a relatively safe investment. Many institutional investors,
such as insurance companies and pension funds, said at the time
they were steering clear of all corporate bonds.
   Since the RJR Nabisco buyout, one of the major credit-rating
agencies, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., has started ranking corporate
bonds by the degree of protection they provide against event-risk
price drops.
   The buyout ``made it more important to consider event risk as
one buys investment-grade securities,'' said James C. Goss, a
high-yield analyst for the Chicago investment firm Duff &amp; Phelps
Inc.
   Added S&amp;P analyst Bill Wetreich: ``What it brought home was that
size is not a protection against event risk. Prior to RJR there was
a sense that the size of certain deals would preclude them from
being done.''
   While holders of existing RJR Nabisco bonds weren't pleased by
the buyout, the new junk bonds have done well in the market while
other LBO-related junk issues have plunged.
   That's due to several factors, including the sheer size of the
RJR Nabisco bond issue, which gives it built-in liquidity; the
company's predictable cash flow; its strong, no-frills consumer
products, which should fare well in a recession; and its ability to
sell divisions for a good price, analysts say.

   Tokyu Department Store is negotiating to buy New
York's famed Bloomingdale's department store chain, news reports
said today.
   The Tokyo-based chain will likely buy Bloomingdale's for $1.3
billion from its current owner, Campeau Corp., a Canadian real
estate company, the economic newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun
reported.
   Tokyu officials were not available for comment today due to a
company holiday.
   Campeau spokeswoman Carol Sanger today declined to comment on
the Japanese news reports. She said Campeau has received
``expressions of interest'' in buying Bloomingdale's but she would
not say whether any formal bids had been made.
   An investment group formed and headed by Tokyu, which ranked
seventh in earnings last year among Japanese department stores, and
other investors will invest approximately $400 million in the
buyout, and the remaining $900 million will be covered by loans
from financial institutions, the newspaper said.
   Kyodo News Service reported that Campeau, which bought
Bloomingdale's in the spring of 1988, later announced its intention
to sell the upscale department store chain due to its difficulties
in obtaining capital.
   But the real estate company had not yet reached agreement with
Tokyu on many details of the purchase, including price and the
manner in which the buyout would be completed.
   Owned by Campeau, which is reportedly in financial trouble,
Bloomingdale's presents a negative image to some banks and
investors, said the Nihon Keizai Shimbun report.
   Bloomingdale's, a popular American department store chain, has
17 stores mainly on the East coast of the United States, including
New York and Washington. Kyodo reported Bloomingdale's has annual
sales of about $1.2 billion.
   However, Kyodo quoted department store sources as saying the
deal was seen as involving risks for Tokyu, and said they
questioned Bloomingdale's past performance and profitability. It
did not elaborate.

   The stock market headed lower today as investors
studied the latest data on the pace of the economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 10.45 to
2,642.83 by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 9 to 5 in nationwide trading

   Before the opening the Commerce Department reported that the
gross national product grew at a 2.5 percent annual rate, after
adjustment for inflation, in the third quarter.
   That matched the increase posted for the second quarter and was
in line with, or slightly stronger than, advance estimates in the
financial world.
   The figures elicited no strong response in either the stock or
bond markets. Some observers said traders were relieved not to see
the economy slowing too suddenly.
   But observers also said the report showed a buildup of
inventories that betokened continued problems for the manufacturing
sector of the economy, which has been struggling of late.
   Compaq Computer tumbled 10\ to 98]. Late Wednesday the company

   Control Data Corp. said Thursday it
has agreed to sell its 1,000-employee computer maintenance business
in the United States to Bell Atlantic Corp. of Philadelphia for an
undisclosed price.
   The sale, to be completed by the end of the year, involves
operations that service computers made by International Business

retaining service operations for its own computers.
   Bell Atlantic will merge the Control Data operations with its
Pennsylvania-based Sorbus subsidiary, which has 2,200 employees.
Bell Atlantic is a regional Bell phone company with headquarters in
Philadelphia.
   ``We anticipate that a significant number of the Control Data
people will be integrated into Sorbus as a result of the sale. We
don't have an exact number,'' said Stacey Mironov, a Bell Atlantic
spokeswoman.
   Control Data said the computer maintenance business has been
profitable, but is being sold because it doesn't fit the new focus
of the company's computer business.
   Nancy Foltz, a Control Data spokeswoman, said, ``This was not
done to raise cash. It was done for strategic reasons.''

   Grain and soybean futures prices were mixed in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade as gains linked
to new export business were offset by harvest-related selling.
   The markets opened mostly higher on news that the Agriculture
Department had given the Soviet Union approval to buy up to 16
million metric tons of U.S. grain in the fiscal year that began
October 1. That's 4 million tons more than had previously been
approved.
   But traders said the increase had been widely anticipated, so
Wednesday's announcement prompted only a brief flurry of buying
that was quickly neutralized by harvest-related selling.
   The good fieldwork conditions that have prevailed in the Midwest
this week are expected to continue into the weekend, speeding new
supplies of corn and soybeans to market.
   ``The weather remains the most bearish influence here,'' said
Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in
Chicago.
   In early trading, wheat futures were unchanged to 2\ cents lower
with the contract for December delivery at $4.03\ a bushel; corn

<HEAD>Regulators Say Superiors Ignored Warnings on Lincoln Savings and
Loan</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: New throughout with testimony today.</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Regulators who recommended in 1987 that the
government seize Lincoln Savings and Loan Association told Congress
today they were astonished their superiors allowed it to continue
to pile up millions of dollars in losses.
   Mike Patriarca, principal supervisory agent in the San Francisco
branch of the Office of Thrift Supervision, and William Black,
district counsel in San Francisco, told the House Banking Committee
they saw no reason why top thrift regulator M. Danny Wall rejected
their 1987 recommendation.
   The committee conducted the second of four scheduled hearings
into the failure of Lincoln, based in Irvine, Calif., which is
expected to cost taxpayers $2 billion, making it the nation's
costliest thrift collapse.
   Patriarca and Black said they tried to have Lincoln closed to
stop its losses, but were thwarted by the vigorous lobbying of its
owner, Phoenix millionaire Charles H. Keating Jr.
   The government did not take over Lincoln until this April,
allowing the institution to pile up millions in additional losses.
   The panel is focusing on a decision by Wall, director of the
thrift office, to take Patriarca and Black off the case and
transfer it to Washington-based examiners, who subsequently
recommended against a government takeover.
   ``I was astonished that (the Washington regulators) would
recommend against a receivership. Frankly I still find that
astonishing,'' Patriarca said.
   ``Clearly we were shot in the back'' by the Washington
regulators when ``we battled to protect the taxpayers from Lincoln
Savings,'' Black said.
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the banking panel,
said of Wall, ``The chief federal regulator in Washington, D.C.,
... willingly cut the legs out from under his regulatory troops in
the middle of the battle.''
   Patriarca told the committee Keating wielded influence ``in all
three branches of government.''
   `When it came to influence, the Keating crowd really outshone
the Texas crowd,'' he said in a reference to notorious S&amp;L fraud
cases in that state.
   Black said a 1985 letter from Federal Reserve Board Chairman
Alan Greenspan, then a private economist, saying Lincoln was a
strong institution was particularly influential with members of
Congress.
   Gonzalez earlier had accused Wall of trying to influence today's
testimony by summoning Patriarca and Black to a meeting with a
thrift agency attorney in Washington on Oct. 10.
   However, Karl Hoyle, a spokesman for Wall, said the Oct. 10
meeting was voluntary and was called to ``minimize misconceptions''
rather than to influence the two.
   ``Nobody's telling them what to say. They'll be under oath,''
Hoyle said. ``The object was to give the committee the full story.''
   In another development, a source in the Office of Thrift
Supervision, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Justice
Department investigators questioned thrift office officials about
allegations that Keating padded top employees' salaries with the
understanding they would contribute to political campaigns.
   The Los Angeles Daily News reported over the weekend that the
thrift office and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. referred the
matter to the FBI for a criminal investigation after they found
evidence that political contributions from Lincoln were laundered
through employee salaries.
   Spokesmen for the thrift office and the FDIC would not say
whether regulators made the referral. An FBI spokesman said it is
against the agency's policy to reveal the existence of an
investigation.
   A lawyer representing Keating had no immediate comment.
   Last week, at the first of four planned hearings on Lincoln,
FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman told the House banking panel that
his agency had begun an investigation of the political
contributions.
   The lobby group Common Cause has asked the Senate Ethics
Committee to examine Keating's contributions to five senators who
in April 1987 met with S&amp;L regulators on Keating's behalf.
   The five are Sens. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; Dennis DeConcini,
D-Ariz.; John McCain, R-Ariz.; John Glenn, D-Ohio; and Donald W.
Riegle Jr., D-Mich. Riegle and DeConcini later returned the
contributions.

<HEAD>Eds: Updates with sharp drop on poor ICI results</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chemicals giant ICI showed lower-than-expected
third-quarter profits Thursday, prompting a sharp drop in London
stock prices on a market already weakened by fears of a British
recession.
   Imperial Chemical Industries PLC reported an 8 percent increase
in profits for the nine months to Sept. 30 to 1.23 million pounds,
or $1.98 million, but the third-quarter profit was down 41 million
pounds to 306 million pounds, well below market forecasts.
   ICI shares fell 55 pence to 11.15 pounds.
   The market fell sharply before recovering somewhat. In late
afternoon, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index was
down 18.1 points, or 0.8 percent, at 2,143.8 points.
   ``No one is interested in buying. I have hardly done any deals
at all this morning,'' one trader said before the ICI-driven fall.
   Another dealer said recent gyrations in world equity markets,
combined with growing pessimism about the British economic outlook,
turned already shy investors into ``complete cowards.''
   ``The institutions just don't have any incentive to get involved
at the moment,'' one trader said. He reported selected buying of
quality blue-chips, but added, ``apart from that it's absolutely
dead.''
   Volume came to a light 271.7 million shares compared with 179.2
million shares at the same time Wednesday.

<HEAD>NV Philips Earnings Rise 41 Percent in Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NV Philips, the Dutch consumer electronics
giant, said Thursday its profit rose 41 percent in the third
quarter in spite of a slump in income from operations.
   In a separate announcement, Philips said it intends to make a
worldwide public stock offering of about 20 percent of the shares
in Polygram, the recording company that owns the classical music
label Deutsche Grammophon and represents pop performers such as Bon
Jovi, Def Leppard, Dire Straits and the Robert Cray Band.
   Philips said third-quarter operating income fell 16 percent
because of a sharp drop in the price of its chips and computers,
but that falloff was compensated for by lower interest payments and
lower exchange-rate losses on loans.
   Philips' consumer electronics and music businesses as well as
domestic appliances and personal-care products all grew healthily,
the company said.
   Philips' profit rose to 227 million guilders, or $109 million at
current exchange rates, from 161 million guilders a year earlier.
   Revenue was flat at 13.6 billion guilders, or $6.5 billion,
because the major domestic appliances business was no longer
included in consolidated results. That business was put in a joint
venture last year with Whirlpool Corp. Excluding that change,
revenue rose 7 percent.
   For the January-September period, net income rose 37 percent to
685 million guilders, or $329 million, from 499 million guilders a
year earlier. Revenue rose to 39.8 billion guilders, or $19.1
billion, from 39 billion guilders a year earlier.
   For the Polygram stock offering, Philips said it intends to file
a preliminary prospectus in the next few weeks with authorities in
the United States and the Netherlands. Philips owns 100 percent of
Polygram, having recently reacquired a 10 percent stake held by an
instutional investor. Philips declined Thursday to name the
investor or say how much it paid to buy back the shares.

<HEAD>Avon Posts Quarterly Earnings After Loss Last Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cosmetics company Avon Products Inc. on Thursday
reported a third-quarter profit of $34.6 million after losing money
a year earlier due to the cost of discontinuing some operations.
   Avon earned 46 cents a share in the three months ended Sept. 30
compared to a loss of $405.9 million, or $7.78 a share, in the
third 1988 quarter, when the company took a $425 million after-tax
charge for discontinued operations.
   Worldwide sales grew 8 percent in the third quarter to $785.1
million from $725.6 million a year earlier.
   James E. Preston, Avon's chairman and chief executive officer,
attributed the company's earnings growth to aggressive expense
reduction programs.
   The New York-based direct sales company implemented new cost
controls and speeded up the sales of certain holdings earlier this
year when it was facing unwanted takeover interest.
   Looked at geographically, Avon said its third-quarter direct
sales slipped a little in the United States, falling 2 percent,
while international sales grew 14 percent. Strong sales in Latin
America are compensating for a below-plan performance in the United
Kingdom and continental Europe, Avon said.
   Avon's retail fragrance division, comprising Giorgio Beverly
Hills and Parfums Stern, had a 41 percent increase in pre-tax
profit on a 35 percent sales gain. Avon has said that it is
exploring the sale of its retail business.
   For the first nine months of the year, Avon earned $80.3 milion,
or 97 cents a share, compared with a loss of $461.1 million, or
$7.20 a share, through the first three quarters of last year.
   Nine-month sales came to $2.27 billion, up 11 percent from the
prior year's $2.05 billion.

<HEAD>Putting Money Behind The Advice</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: CORRECTS spelling of Janke's name in 8th graf</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   For several decades the National Association of
Investors Corp. has preached a conservative investment philosophy
through its member clubs and in manuals and a monthly magazine.
   Smart amateur investors, it advised, should be able on average
to double their money in five or six years in sound common stocks,
and do so without taking unusual risks or relying on costly
professional services.
   Stories are inspiring, but money talks. Asked what new service
the NAIC might offer members, it responded: A common stock mutual
fund. And so the NAIC Growth Fund has been formed. It will put the
philosophers on record.
   Closed end _ meaning individual holdings will be traded like a
stock rather than redeemed through the company _ shares will sell
for $10 each, minimum of 100, through The Allied Group, P.O. Box
10499, Des Moines, Iowa 50306.
   It isn't the first time an advisory service was talked into
direct action, because in some ways stocks are an ego game. You can
star; you can be a hero; you can show up the other fools; you can
be called a guru, a genius.
   In the not distant past, for instance, a popular economic
adviser thought a fund would be nice to publicize his services. He
formed one. He soon found, however, that an adviser can reverse his
position with a telephone call, but that it isn't so in the stock
market. He pulled out, a loser.
   Given time, the new NAIC fund isn't likely to be a loser so long
as it sticks to its philosophy, one that's been demonstrated again
and again but not always listened to in a market geared to
frenzied, sometimes mindless, trading.
   Thomas O'Hara and Kenneth Janke, the fund managers, believe in
patience. At any one time they might not look good, they say, but
over time they think they'll be able to outperform the market with
a low level of risk.
   Their criteria:
   Choose from companies whose sales-earnings have doubled every
five years, especially in the latest five; whose earnings on
invested capital are about the best in the industry; and whose
per-share prices are low by most standards.
   That too is the philosophy of the the association's 6,900
investment clubs and its 132,000 members. And, of course, it is
part of the philsophy of Janke's and O'Hara's own club, the
50-year-old Mutual Investment Club of Detroit.
   In those 50 years, investments of the Detroit club have doubled
on average in less than six years, based on compound annual growth
of 12.5 percent. That, O'Hara says, is 25 percent better than the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index.
   It was the Detroit club that supplied much of the founding
energy for the NAIC back in the 1940s. Since then the NAIC has
published a magazine, ``Better Investing,'' in which it recommends
a monthly stock for study.
   Going back over the records, it finds that these 12 stocks a
year have, on average, performed about the same, that is, close to
doubling every five years. The returns were poor in several years,
many of them in a row. But in good years they made up for the
losses. They even tripled values in one year.
   Not bad for non-professionals, further evidence that people
willing to work at the job can do well in a marketplace dominated
by professional traders.
   Although the new fund will have a professional adviser _
Seger-Elbekorg Inc., Birmingham, Mich. _ it won't deprive itself of
amateur opinion. At least two are on the board _ and both O'Hara
and Janke tend to identify as amateurs, although O`Hara once was a
governor of the New York Stock Exchange.
   Then there are volunteers. O'Hara, who is NAIC chairman _ Janke
is president _ relates how you're not likely to sit anywhere next
to an NAIC member who won't nudge you and tell you the story of a
good prospect.
   No, he said, they don't tell you about it because they want
others to invest and push up the price. That would be nice, of
course, but ``it's pride,'' says O'Hara.
   These people are intelligent, creative and wise, he says, and
they are proud of their discoveries. Like any hobbyist with a
consuming interest, they like to share. It's their bond with other
members.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nigel Lawson resigned today as chancellor of the
exchequer because of disagreements with an economic adviser to
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, the Treasury said.
   The resignation of Britain's top economic official was effective
immediately.
   Lawson told Mrs. Thatcher in a letter released by the Treasury
that he could not serve as her treasury secretary as long as she
continued to take advice from Sir Alan Walters, her personal
economic adviser.
   Lawson wrote: ``I have therefore regretfully concluded that it
is in the best interests of the government for me to resign my
office without further ado.''
   Lawson said he would continue to support the government as a
member of Parliament.
   Mrs. Thatcher quickly named Foreign Secretary John Major as his
replacement. Major is a former senior Treasury official.
   There have been persistent press reports that Lawson suspected
Mrs. Thatcher was ignoring his advice and relying on Walters'
instead.
   The resignation was seen as a severe blow to her Cabinet at a
time of high inflation and interest rates, and declining ratings in
the opinion polls for her Conservative Party.
   Lawson and Walters' main difference was believed to have focused
on Britain's attitude on the European Monetary System.
   Lawson favored linking the pound to the exchange rate mechanism
which limits swings in currencies, but Walters was openly against
it.
   Lawson, 57, became chancellor in 1983.

<HEAD>Economy Up Moderately in Third Quarter</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The U.S. economy grew at a moderate annual
rate of 2.5 percent from July through September despite the poorest
trade performance in six years and a $4 billion income loss from
Hurricane Hugo, the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said the increase in the gross national
product, the broadest measure of economic health, matched a 2.5
percent rise in the April-June quarter. Third-quarter growth was
aided primarily by a boom in consumer spending that resulted from
heavy car sales.
   Inflation showed a marked improvement in the third quarter, with
a price index tied to the GNP climbing at an annual rate of just
2.9 percent, down significantly from a 4.9 percent annual advance
in the first half of the year.
   Michael Darby, commerce undersecretary for economic affairs,
said the moderate economic growth and lower inflation offer
encouraging signs that the nation's record peacetime expansion will
extend into the next decade.
   The lower inflation rate is ``creating appropriate conditions
for stronger non-inflationary growth as the decade of the 1990s
unfolds,'' Darby said.
   Through the first nine months of 1989, the economy has grown at
an annual rate of 2.9 percent, exactly on target with the Bush
administration's forecast for the whole year.
   But many analysts are predicting that growth will slump
dramatically in the final three months of this year in the absence
of the auto sales boom that spurred consumer spending from July
through September.
   Many economists predict the country will flirt with a possible
recession over the next 12 months because of expected weakness in
such areas as trade and business investment.
   Signs of deterioration were evident in the third quarter as the
U.S. trade deficit, as measured by the GNP, surged by $22.9
billion. It was the worst trade figure since the second quarter of
1983.
   Trade had been one of the economy's brightest spots as a boom in
export sales had spurred a rebound in U.S. manufacturing. However,
economists have warned for some time that hefty increases in the
value of the dollar threatened to derail the trade improvement by
making American goods more expensive on overseas markets.
   In the third quarter, imports shot up at an annual rate of 15.1
percent while exports did not grow at all, the poorest showing for
exports since early 1986.
   The economy was also held back in the third quarter by a $4
billion loss in personal incomes attributed to the devastation from
Hurricane Hugo, which hit the Southeast in September.
   The estimate of income loss was attributed to uninsured losses
and loss of rental income by property owners.
   The stock market reacted negatively to the GNP report, with the
Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks dropping 36.07 points by
1 p.m. EDT.
   In another economic report today, the Labor Department said
private-sector labor contracts negotiated through collective
bargaining from January through September provided average annual
wage increases of 3.1 percent. First-year pay hikes in those pacts
averaged 3.7 percent.
   On Capitol Hill, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady called on
Congress to make additional reforms in the way financial markets
are regulated, saying the Securities and Exchange Commission should
be empowered to halt trading in times of emergencies.
   The SEC's chairman, Richard C. Breeden, has said he does not
want such authority.
   In his first testimony to Congress since the Oct. 13 market
slide, Brady said the finaicial turmoil had not altered his belief
in the souncness of the U.S. economy, but did point up the need for
changes in market regulation.
   Some economists are predicting that growth in the economy during
the final three months of the year could slip to an annual rate of
1.5 percent or less.
   While such an anemic pace increases the risk of a recession,
many analysts are counting on the Federal Reserve to ride to the
rescue by lowering interest rates in order to spur activity in home
building and other interest-sensitive sectors of the economy.
   At the same time, many economists expect unemployment to rise
during the next 12 months before growth rebounds by the end of 1990.
   ``We are not going to have a recession, but we will have a very
significant slowdown in the economy,'' said David Wyss, an
economist with DRI-McGraw Hill, an economic consulting firm.
   Business capital spending, another of the economy's bright
spots, slowed in the third quarter, rising at an annual rate of 5.3
percent. Analysts are looking for further declines in this area as
businesses, hurt by falling profits, cut back on investment plans.
   Housing construction, which has been in a slump as a result of
the Federal Reserves's earlier credit squeeze to fight inflation,
fell at an annual rate of 4.8 percent in the third quarter, the
third consecutive quarterly decline.
   Consumer spending was essentially the only area of strength in
the July-September period as purchases shot up by 5.8 percent, the
strongest rise since the first quarter of 1988. Analysts attributed
the gain to the surge in car sales which resulted from the wave of
discounts offered by automakers to clear out an inventory of unsold
models.
   However, economists say these discounts actually stole sales
from the 1990 model year. For that reason, they believe consumer
spending, which accounts for two-thirds of all economic activity,
will be exceptionally weak in the current October-December period.
   The various changes left the economy, after adjusting for
inflation, growing at an annual rate of $4.158 trillion in the
third quarter, up $25.6 billion from the second-quarter pace.

   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady today called
on Congress to make additional reforms in the way financial markets
are regulated, saying the Securities and Exchange Commission should
be empowered to halt trading in times of emergencies.
   The SEC's chairman has said he does not want such authority.
   In his first testimony to Congress since the Oct. 13 market
slide, Brady said the financial turmoil had not altered his belief
in the soundness of the U.S. economy. But he said it did point up
the need for further changes in market regulation.
   The power to halt market trading now rests solely with the
president. Brady's support for giving this authority to the SEC is
at odds with the recommendation from SEC Chairman Richard C.
Breeden, who told Congress on Wednesday that his agency does not
need or want the power to halt trading.
   Brady, in a letter accompanying his testimony to the Senate
Banking Committee, noted the SEC's reluctance to take on the
emergency trading halt power, but he said he believed the change
was needed.
   He said the initial governmental response to market emergencies
should come ``from a regulator with expertise and proximity to the
markets.''
   Brady noted that legislation pending before both the House and
the Senate gives the president power to terminate SEC emergency
actions and would require presidential approval for any trading
halt longer than 24 hours.
   The stock market continued its gyrations today, as the Dow Jones
average of 30 indiustrial stocks dropped 39.14 points by 1.30 p.m.
EDT in a negative reaction to a report that the gross national
product rose at a moderate 2.5 percent annual pace in the third
quarter.
   Brady, a former Wall Street executive, gave his general support
to the package of changes but cautioned lawmakers against going too
far in their efforts to eliminate market volatility.
   ``We cannot and should not attempt to eliminate major market
moves, whether by legislation or regulation,'' he said. ``But we do
need to ensure that our markets are configured in the best manner
possible to withstand the increasing demands that are placed on
them.''
   Brady said he supported changes that would require large
security transactions to be reported to regulators so that the SEC
and other agencies would have a better idea of who was buying and
selling large blocks of stock during periods of sharp market swings.
   Other parts of the legislation that Brady favored included rules
that would allow regulators to assess the financial soundness of
the parent holding companies of brokerage houses. He also supported
improved coordination in the clearing and settling of market
transactions.
   ``The tailspin of the equity and derivative markets on Friday,
Oct. 13, raised fears of an eerie repeat of the Friday before the
Monday collapse in October 1987,'' Brady testified.
   But he said that in many ways the government's response to the
most recent turmoil showed that the reforms instituted since the
1987 crash had worked well.
   ``Although investor concerns were understandable, there was
obviously a greater sense of confidence by all market
participants,'' Brady said.
   While disagreeing with Brady on whether the SEC should have the
power to halt trading, Breeden told a House panel Wednesday that he
supported the other recommendations in the pending legislation.
   ``The commission at this time does not have all the tools
necessary for dealing with periods of market turbulence,'' Breeden
told the telecommunications and finance subcommittee chaired by
Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass.
   Another witness, Edward I. O'Brien, president of the Securities
Industry Association, a trade group, said he opposed the large
trade and financial soundness changes, saying they were too vague
and needed more study.
   O'Brien and George Bissell, chairman of the market reform task
force of the Investment Company Institute, a mutual fund trade
group, supported rules that would give the SEC power to halt
trading for up to 24 hours during market emergencies.
   But Breeden said safety mechanisms called circuit-breakers _
temporary automatic trading halts in times of market volatility _
have eliminated much of the need for officials to stop trading.
   Markey suggested halting only program trading, the
computer-driven sale of vast blocks of stocks by large,
institutional investors, which many cite as a contributing factor
in the 1987 market crash.
   Breeden said he would consider working with the subcommittee if
new methods were found to be needed, but for now he thought
``non-discretionary'' halts were less likely to cause uncertainty
among traders.
   It was the first public appearance by the new SEC head since the
Oct. 13 market slide.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, a key market indicator,
plunged 190.58 points Friday, Oct. 13, then rebounded to close
88.12 points higher the next Monday.
   The market's roller-coaster gyrations prompted concern about
another crash like the 508-point drop in October 1987.

</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Dear Margaret,
   The successful conduct of economic policy is possible only if
there is _ and is seen to be _ full agreement between the Prime
Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
   Recent events have confirmed that this essential requirement
cannot be satisfied so long as Alan Walters remains your personal
economic adviser.
   I have therefore regretfully concluded that it is in the best
interests of the Government for me to resign my office without
further ado.
   I am extremely grateful to you for the opportunity you have
given me to serve in the Government, particularly over the past six
and a half years as Chancellor; and I am proud of what we have
achieved together.
   I shall, of course, continue to support the Government from the
back-benches.
   Yours ever,

<UNK>Ford Offers British Workers 8 Percent Raise For Coming Year</UNK>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Company Ltd. said Thursday it opened
contract talks by offering its hourly workers a 15 percent wage
increase over the course of two years, but the hike was rejected by
union leaders.
   A spokesman for the British operations of Ford Motor Co. said
33,000 manual workers at the company's 21 plants in Britain have
been offered an 8 percent increase in the first year and 7 percent
in the second.
   Charlie Whelan, an official of the Amalgamated Engineering Union
said, however, that Ford's offer has been rejected by union leaders
as ``totally unacceptable'' and therefore wouldn't be submitted to
the union membership for a vote.
   Negotiations are to resume negotiations on Nov. 6, said the Ford
spokesman, who wasn't identified.
   The settlement is being watched closely as a barometer of wage
inflation in the Britain.
   Annual wage increases are currently running at about 8.75
percent; overall inflation is about 7.6 percent. Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher has urged companies not to give in to wage
demands that would aggravate inflation.
   Unions earlier this month rejected Vauxhall Motors Ltd.'s offer
of a 9.1 percent raise, made as part of a two-year package that
also includes an increase in holidays. Vauxhall is a unit of
General Motors Corp.
   On Thursday, workers at Vauxhall's Ellesmere Port plant voted in
favor of a series of one-day strikes in support of their claim for
a 25 percent increase. The workers also voted for an overtime ban
at the factory in northwest England.
   The 4,300 hourly workers must vote to legally confirm the
planned action, part of a national campaign also affecting
Vauxhall's car factory and parts operation in Luton, north of
London.

   President Bush, citing ``valid concerns'' over
food safety regulation because of stories of pesticide-tainted
apples and other foods, today proposed legislation allowing
pesticides to be taken off the market more quickly.
   The plan, attacked in advance by environmentalists as a step
backward in some areas, would overhaul pesticide regulation laws
enforced by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and
Drug Administration.
   The president said the plan, which he called ``a major
initiative on food safety,'' was partly in response to public's
concern over stories ``alleging the presence of dangerous levels of
pesticides.''
   Bush said ``we have the safest food supply in the world, I'm
absolutely convinced of that. And we're going to keep it that way.''
   And, while claiming the nation's food supply to be safe, he said
``some of the public's perception is based on valid concerns about
the government's slow and cumbersome process for removing
pesticides from the market.''
   Bush commented during in a picture-taking session with
administration officials involved in developing the package, a task
he said took several months.
   The president mentioned a high degree of awareness by Americans
of news stories earlier this year on the presence of the
cancer-causing chemical Alar on some apples; and, more recently,
concern about the widespread use of the fungicide EBDC on fruits
and vegetables.
   ``These stories have fueled the public concern about cancer
risks, and more important for us, have called into question the
government's ability to insure a safe supply of food for our
citizens,'' Bush said.
   Earlier, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the plan
would ``streamline EPA's ability to remove potentially hazardous
pesticides from the market and enhance the agency's enforcement
program.''
   He also said it would tighten FDA rules governing the allowable
tolerances of pesticide residues in food.
   Overall, the plan is ``a comprehensive program to enhance food
safety for all Americans,'' Fitzwater said.
   Environmentalists began attacking the plan as information began
surfacing on Wednesday.
   ``From our side it's worse than the current law,'' said Janet
Hathaway, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council, which
has been a sharp critic of the government's control of pesticides
on food products.
   Responding to the criticism, Fitzwater said environmentalists
were being ``appropriately wary, as they always are in these
cases.''
   He conceded that one aspect of the plan would require states to
obtain special ``waivers'' to enact tougher food-safety standards
than the federal government.
   Currently, no such waivers are required.
   Still, Fitzwater said a major benefit of the plan would be in
giving the government the ability to take suspect pesticides off
the market swiftly.
   Currently, a long process ``that sometimes takes months and
years to do'' is required, he said.
   ``These changes are designed to speed that up, make it easier to
stop the production or the use of pesticides while (government
regulators) are considering a total ban,'' the spokesman said.
   The pesticide issue gained widespread attention earlier this
year during the public outcry over use of Alar on apples. The EPA
acknowledged that Alar caused cancer but said it could not be taken
off the market immediately. The manufacturer later stopped selling
the chemical voluntarily.
   While EPA Administrator William K. Reilly declined to discuss
details of the proposal pending the White House announcement, he
said it was ``responsive to a number of problems this agency has
had in administering our pesticide law.''
   Sources familiar with the administration plan said it calls for
a shift in the way the EPA determines whether a potentially
dangerous chemical used on food may be taken off the market,
relying on less time-consuming rulemaking procedures instead of
lengthy judicial hearings.
   It also gives the EPA greater leeway to suspend use of a
chemical without first having to show an ``imminent hazard'' to
public health, as is now required, sources said. In some cases, the
agency will not have to consider economic costs in suspending use
of a chemical if the health risks are considered substantial.
   Environmentalists praised such changes, but criticized other
provisions expected to be in the president's plan.
   Ms. Hathaway said environmentalists are expected to oppose a
provision calling on Congress to establish uniform pesticide
standards nationwide because that, she said, would effectively
pre-empt stronger state laws.
   In addition, the president's plan was expected to call for
relaxing the threshold at which a chemical will be considered to
pose an unacceptable health risk. The EPA has been using a risk
level of 1 in 1 million as the benchmark that triggers regulatory
action. Under the president's plan the threshold in some cases
could be increased to 1 in 100,000.
   ``We're talking about an erosion of the concept of negligible
risk here,'' said Ms. Hathaway, arguing that a risk level of 1 in
100,000 is not adequate to protect the public.

   Stock prices lapsed into a broad decline today
as investors studied the latest data on the pace of the economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 32.58 points to
2,620.70 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 3 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 330 up,
1,139 down and 421 unchanged.
   Before the opening the Commerce Department reported that the
gross national product grew at a 2.5 percent annual rate, after
adjustment for inflation, in the third quarter.
   That matched the increase posted for the second quarter and was
in line with, or slightly stronger than, advance estimates in the
financial world.
   But observers also said the report showed a buildup of
inventories that betokened continued problems for the manufacturing
sector of the economy, which has been struggling of late.
   They also noted worries about the outlook for corporate profits,
intensified by a series of disappointing reports from individual
companies in recent weeks.
   Compaq Computer fell 6| to 102. Late Wednesday the company
reported a third-quarter earnings gain that came up short of
expectations, and aanlysts also cited uncertainty over the
company's fourth-quarter prospects.
   Anheuser Busch lost | to 37~ on top of a 4]-point drop
Wednesday, when the company posted a smaller-than-expected profit
increase for the third quarter and said it was planning a
price-cutting strategy for its beers.
   Philip Morris, whose Miller Brewing operation competes with
Busch, dropped 1\ to 42\.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slumped 2.15 to 187.37. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down 2.80 at 373.12.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 122.21 million shares with two

<HEAD>Galoob's Profit, Sales Post Records</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Lewis Galoob Toys Inc. Thursday announced a 56 percent jump in
third-quarter earnings on a 52 percent sales gain.
   The company credited strong sales of its Micro Machines
miniature vehicles, Bouncin' Baby dolls and a few toys introduced
this year for its record results.
   Galoob earned $7.29 million, or 75 cents a share, in the three
months ended Sept. 30 _ the largest quarterly amount ever for the
company _ compared to $4.69 million, or 51 cents a share, a year
earlier. Sales reached a record $76.04 million, up from $50.05
million in 1988's third quarter.
   ``This record-setting quarter, coming on the heels of six
previous consecutive record quarters, demonstrates the success of
the company's strategic marketing position, as well as the
tremendous receptions given our products in the marketplace,'' said
David Galoob, president, chief executive and chairman.
   Micro Machines have been on Toy &amp; Hobby World magazine's monthly
hit parade of hot-selling toys consistently since April 1988. Toy
industry analysts say Galoob's sad-faced Lost and Found stuffed
animals, which cry tears when fed a bottle, could be a big seller
this Christmas.
   For the first nine months of the year, Galoob had more than a
three-fold income gain. It earned $14.39 million, or $1.49 a share,
compared to $3.31 million, or 36 cents a share, through three
quarters of last year.
   Nine-month sales were $169.65 million, up 80 percent from $94.46
million in the comparable 1988 period.

<HEAD>Vatican Deficit $57 Million, But Austerity Measures Helping</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: also on general news wires.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Vatican was in the red by $57 million
last year but reduced its deficit by nearly $9 million from the
projected figure through austerity measures, a financial statement
said Thursday.
   A Canadian cardinal also said the Vatican, after resisting for
five years, has agreed to open its books, sending a copy of the
Holy See's financial statement to every diocese in the world.
   The new statement made no mention of this year's financial
position but indicated that spending for computers and other
modernizing investments was heavy while its daily newspaper and
radio station were a drain on the treasury.
   In March, the Vatican had forecast a record deficit of $78
million for 1989.
   The figures were released by the 12-member Council of Cardinals
for the Study of the Organization and Economic Problems of the Holy
See at the end of three days of meetings.
   It said the regular 1988 deficit amounted to $43.5 million,
based on revenue of $74.4 million and expenses of $117.9 million.
But it said extraordinary expenditures for its radio station and
restoration of buildings increased the deficit to $57.2 million.
   Still this was below the $66 million forecast a year ago
``thanks to efforts at austerity by various offices of the Holy See
... to reduce expenses to the minimum.''
   The 1987 deficit stood at $64 million.
   The 1988 shortfall was nearly covered by ``Peter's Pence,'' the
annual offering from Catholics to the pope. It said this amounted
to $52.9 million.
   The budget covers expenses for the curia, or the church's
central administration, Vatican radio, diplomatic missions and the
Vatican newspaper, L'Osservatore Romano.
   It does not include the Vatican bank, whose statements are still
secret, or the travels of Pope John Paul II, which the Vatican says
are paid for by local churches.
   The only specific offices listed were the radio, in the red by
$15.6 million, and the newspaper, with a $5.2 million deficit.
   Cardinal Gerald Carter of Toronto, a member of the economic
commission, told Vatican Radio the Holy See still is facing a
financial crunch.
   ``Now that we say we covered our deficit this year, people are
going to relax and say well that's fine, the Holy See is out of the
hole. But we're not out of the hole. We're going to be in the exact
same situation next year,'' he said.
   Carter said outside accounts are examining the financial
statement, which will be distributed to dioceses. He said the
Vatican had been reluctant to do this.
   ``Why, what their reluctance was, I've never been able to
understand, but it did take us five years. Every year we were
pounding on the same thing and finally we got it done,'' he said.
   One bright spot is the Vatican City-State, the equivalent of
local government, which earns more than it spends by providing
services such as electricity, water and mail, and running the
Vatican Museum.
   Half of its $13 million surplus went to meet the Holy See, the
statement said.

<HEAD>Study Says Seven Big Corporations Paid No Federal Tax in 1988</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Seven huge profitable corporations were able
legally to avoid paying federal income tax last year _ a decline
from 50 because of the 1986 tax overhaul, a private study concluded
Thursday.
   Citizens for Tax Justice, a labor-financed research
organization, said the average tax rate paid by the nation's 250
biggest moneymaking companies rose last year to 26.5 percent,
compared with 14.3 percent in 1981 through 1985. Forty-five
corporations still paid less than 10 percent of their profits in
income taxes, fewer than half the number reported a year earlier.
   The study found the new law is shifting a greater share of the
tax burden to corporations, as it was intended to do. Corporate
taxes paid 12 percent of the non-Social Security federal budget
last year, up from 8 percent in the first half of the 1980s, the
report stated.
   ``Tax reform is working,'' Robert S. McIntyre, executive
director of Citizens for Tax Justice, said in releasing the
organization's fifth annual report on corporate taxes. ``Business
investment has boomed since tax reform, as money that used to go
into wasteful tax shelters has returned to the productive economy.''
   McIntyre's past reports, which found that as many as 70 of the
250 profitmaking giants paid no income tax in one or more years,
were credited with helping to goad Congress into overhauling the
tax law.
   However, because the studies are based on the organization's
interpretation of corporate report, they often are disputed by some
of the companies cited.
   For example, the new report listed Santa Fe Southern Pacific as
one of the seven profitable companies that paid no tax in 1988. The
report said the company had profits of almost $180 million,
received a $2.1 million refund of past taxes paid, and thus had a
negative tax rate of 1.2 percent.
   ``We had a net loss in 1988 of $46.5 million as a result of a
charge of about $627 million relating to divestiture of Southern
Pacific Railroad, which we were required to do by the Interstate
Commerce Commission,'' said Bob Gehrt, a Santa Fe vice president in
Chicago.
   The new tax law enacted in 1986 repealed the investment tax
credit; sharply curtailed an accounting method that allowed large
contractors to defer taxes until a project was completed;
eliminated the tax preference for capital gains and tightened the
``minimum tax,'' a special levy aimed at profitmaking businesses
that use large writeoffs to avoid all or most of their tax
liability.
   The report said that, in addition to Santa Fe Southern, five
large companies paid no tax in 1988 and actually received refunds
of past-year taxes, resulting in negative tax rates.
   They were: Kroger, $29 million profit and a negative tax rate of
28.3 percent; Pinnacle West, $75 million profit, minus 28.1
percent; CSX, $402 million profit, minus 14.7 percent; Illinois
Power, $227 million profit, minus 11.3 percent, and Media General,
$75 million profit, minus 5.7 percent.
   Gulf States Utilities was reported as having a profit of $164
million and neither paying a 1988 tax nor receiving any refund.
   The highest effective tax rate among the 250 companies was paid
by Rockwell International, at 192.5 percent. The company, a major
defense contractor, paid $1.37 billion tax last year on profits of
$714 million. The study said the high rate reflected Rockwell's
payment of more than $1 billion of tax that was deferred during
1981-1987.
   The 250 companies in 1988 paid $34.5 billion tax on $130 billion
in profits, an average effective rate of 26.5 percent.

   Wheat futures prices dropped below $4 a bushel
for the first time in nearly a month Thursday on the Chicago Board
of Trade as traders weary of waiting for new export business took
profits.
   Other grain and soybean futures were narrowly mixed in listless
trading.
   A lack of new U.S. wheat sales to the Soviet Union was the
biggest bearish factor in Thursday's market, said Katharina Zimmer,
a grain analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. in New York.
   ``They apparently have picked up Canadian wheat and wheat from
England, and the market is just tired of waiting,'' she said.
   The Agriculture Department announced late Wednesday it had given
the Soviets approval to buy an additional 4 million metric tons of
grain in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, raising the ceiling to
16 million tons.
   But traders said the announcement had been expected, which
limited its market impact, and Ms. Zimmer said recent purchases of
feed grains have packed the Soviet grain pipeline.
   ``Nobody expects the Russians to be back tomorrow to buy more
corn _ or wheat for that matter,'' she said.

   Stock prices closed sharply lower Thursday after
the market's confidence in British corporate profits was shaken by
bellwether Imperial Chemical Industries PLC's disappointing
third-quarter results.
   ICI, which is a key component of the Financial Times-Stock
Exchange 100-share index, said its pre-tax profit for the quarter
dropped by 12 percent to the equivalent of $490 million,
significantly under market expectations.
   As ICI's share price fell, the 100-share index followed.
   The key index closed at its session low of 2,129.4, down 32.5
points, or 1.5 percent. It had been pressured from the outset of
dealings by expectations of soft ICI earnings.
   ``ICI is a bellwether of U.K. corporate profitability,'' a
senior dealer with Warburg Securities said. ``It's results were
disappointing. The market followed.''
   ICI finished 73 pence lower at 10.97 pounds.

   Cash registers fell quiet along the
Fisherman's Wharf waterfront following the earthquake, and the
multibillion-dollar tourism industry still awaits the return of its
sales.
   The usually bustling tourist spots are not a pretty sight these
days. Along the barren walkways from Pier 39 to Ghirardelli Square,
tourists are few, attractions are empty and T-shirt vendors sit
forlornly next to their stands.
   It's so deserted that street parking is easy, an unheard of
proposition in normal times.
   ``The tourists who were here before the earthquake have left and
haven't come back,'' says Narcis Carranza, leaning next to his
sweater stand by Pier 41. ``I haven't sold anything.''
   He says he's suffered a 90 percent drop in business since last
week's quake.
   As for San Francisco Bay cruises, even a sunny day with views
all the way to Angel Island can't lure the few tourists remaining.
   The Blue &amp; Gold Fleet's 400-passenger sightseeing boats make
only two daily trips, compared to the usual nine, these days
because of sparse business, says Katie Thorsen.
   On a typical day, she sells 400-600 $12 tickets. She sold 56
tickets Wednesday and wasn't looking to fare any better Thursday.
   ``I think people are going to start coming back,'' she says. ``I
think if you give them a couple of weeks.''
   Hotel operators, many of whom have seen their rooms emptied and
reservations canceled, hope that's correct.
   ``Business is down. I think it's all hotels in the city, every
business in the city,'' says Fil Da Cunha, assistant general
manager of the Holiday Inn at Fisherman's Wharf.
   Most of the 580 rooms at the Holiday Inn were filled when the
7.1 magnitude quake rumbled through Northern California, but the
occupancy rate has dropped to about 25 percent now, he said.
   Da Cunha, with bitterness in his voice, partially blames the
news media for what he calls an obsession with the damaged areas in
San Francisco's Marina District, the Bay Bridge and Interstate 880.
   ``They haven't showed all the buildings standing up, yet,'' he
says.
   At The Wharf Inn, business has dropped dramatically and
occupancy stands at about 27 percent, says Suzanne Reese, general
manager of the 51-room hotel on Mason Street, near the waterfront.
   ``I think it will affect our business for quite a while. We've
had a lot of cancellations,'' says Reese.
   Though there was damage to some tourist areas and other parts of
San Francisco, it wasn't devastating. The city is not flattened,
something officials are trying to pass on to people planning a
visit here.
   Phone calls to the San Francisco Convention and Visitors Bureau
are met with a taped message that begins, ``The city is returning
to normal...''
   After the quake, the bureau's eight-person sales staff jumped on
the phones and called convention and meeting planners to assure
them the city was intact and that ``we were open for business,''
says Sharon Rooney, public relations manager.
   They also called travel publications to let them know that most
businesses in San Francisco were not damaged. The bureau enlisted
Mayor Art Agnos to write a letter this week telling meeting
planners the city was safe.
   In San Francisco, where tourism is the No. 1 industry _ worth
$3.4 billion _ only two major meetings were canceled, says Rooney.
Nissan had been expected Thursday, while the League of California
Cities also canceled its Oct. 21 convention. The city lost at least
6,000 delegates from the two cancellations.
   In Oakland, the tourism industry was initially hurt after the
quake but has bounced back almost to normal, according to Linda
Howell of the Oakland Convention and Visitor Bureau.
   Where hotel occupancy at one point fell to 25 percent in
Oakland, the rate has increased to about 80 percent, she said. But,
as Howell notes, San Francisco has about eight times more
first-class hotel rooms than Oakland.
   ``They have a larger stake there,'' she says. ``They're going to
be hurt more.''
   Most tourists fled after the Oct. 17 quake, but some stayed.
There are even a few who arrived after the temblor.
   ``A lot of people have asked us, `How come you came _ you're so
brave,''' says Audrey Malling, who along with her husband, Gerald,
arrived in San Francisco two nights after the quake from
Greenville, Mich.
   The elderly couple, leaning against a pier with a clear,
breathtaking view of Alacatraz, say they really didn't think of
changing their longstanding plans to visit their son, Paul.
   ``It's kind of nice for us, cause we don't worry about getting
into things,'' quips Gerald Malling, an attorney.
   John Marshall and his wife, Ilona, of Beden, West Germany,
arrived in San Francisco on Wednesday. They were at Disneyland when
the quake hit.
   The Marshalls, sitting in a courtyard in the Hyde Street Pier,
across the street from The Cannery shopping center, say they've
been through earthquakes before.
   ``So we are not afraid of the earthquake,'' says John Marshall.
``Everyone has to die and if you are in the wrong place, you have
the bad luck.''

   Mitsubishi Electric Corp. said earnings rose 84.6 percent in the
six months ended Sept. 30 to 25.127 billion yen or $176.95 million,
vs. 13.615 billion yen in the year-earlier period. Earnings per
share rose to 11.79 yen from 6.47 yen. Sales totaled 1,151.110
billion yen, a 12.3 percent rise.
   Japanese companies report their earnings every six months.
   Mitsubishi said sales were particularly strong in its
communication equipment and semiconductor businesses.
   Toshiba Corp. reported similarly large gains, with earnings
rising 47 percent to 48.844 billion yen or $343.79 million from
33.236 billion yen a year earlier. Earnings per share rose to 15.53
yen from 10.90 yen.
   Sales rose 8.1 percent to 1,463.439 billion yen from 1,354.314
billion yen a year earlier. The sales and earnings figures were
records for the first half of the year.
   Sales of laptop computers and other office automation equipement
were primarily responsible for the large earnings gain, the company
said.
   Victor Co. of Japan Ltd., also known as JVC, reported earnings
rose 16 percent to 6.866 billion yen or $48.35 million from 5.937
billion yen a year earlier. Earnings per share weren't reported
because the company is a unit of Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.
   JVC reported a 3 percent decline in sales to 300.666 billion yen
from 308.922 billion yen, partly because of price declines due to
intense competition among consumer electronics makers.
   Hitachi Ltd. said first-half earnings rose 22.2 percent to
55.508 billion yen or $390 million from 45.438 billion yen, largely
because of strong gains in heavy equipment and information
processing sales. Earnings per share rose to 18.20 yen from 15.18
yen. Sales rose 11.9 percent to 1,770.780 billion yen.
   Dollar equivalents are based on an exchange rate of 142 yen to
the dollar.

   The stock market declined broadly today in
selling blamed on increasing concern over the outlook for corporate
earnings.
   Before the opening the Commerce Department reported that the
gross national product grew at a 2.5 percent annual rate, after
adjustment for inflation, in the third quarter.
   That matched the increase posted for the second quarter and was
in line with, or slightly stronger than, advance estimates in the
financial world.
   But observers also said the report showed a buildup of
inventories that betokened continued problems for the manufacturing
sector of the economy, which has been struggling of late.
   In addition also noted worries about corporate profits,
intensified by a series of disappointing reports from individual
companies in recent weeks.

   Michigan Bell said Thursday it will cut roughly a
fifth of its management staff as it reorganizes to fight
competition in the telephone business it once monopolized.
   The company, serving about 3.2 million Michigan telephone
customers, wants to trim its white-collar workforce of 4,200 by
about 850, President Kenneth E. Millard said.
   Total employment at Michigan Bell is about 17,700, down from
more than 19,300 two years ago. Cuts in other areas may be
considered later, spokesman Greg Gordon said.
   For now, the company is offering incentives to lure workers into
early retirement.
   Competition authorized since January 1988 for long-distance and
WATS (wide area telephone service) business will cost Michigan Bell
an estimated $120 million by the end of 1990, including loss of
about 10 percent of its long-distance market and 30 percent of its
WATS line market, Millard said.
   ``Like other deregulating industries, we're taking steps to make
the transition to a non-monopoly, competitive business
environment,'' Millard said. Michigan Bell reported net income of
$316.8 million on revenues of $2.46 billion in 1988, compared with
$307.9 million on revenues of $2.34 billion in 1987.

   Federal Express Corp. pilots on Thursday
voted down union representation, delivering a blow to the Air Line
Pilots Association.
   The rejection stopped the major move to organize workers at
Federal Express, the world's largest small-package delivery company
with 80,000 employees worldwide.
   ``It underscores the fact that ... the pilots, still have a
great deal of confidence in (Federal Express president) Fred Smith
and the management team,'' said David Guthrie, a market analyst
with Morgan Keegan &amp; Co. in Memphis.
   Ballots counted by the National Mediation Board showed that of
the 2,022 Federal Express pilots eligible to vote, 709 cast their
ballots for ALPA, said Joe Anderson, a board spokesman. Ballots
were mailed in over a six-week period.
   Pilots who did not cast ballots in effect voted against the
union, Anderson said.
   ``I undertand ... they had a lot of ballot-burning parties,'' he
said.
   Anderson said the union filed a petition alleging improper
company interference with the election, and the complaint will be
investigated.
   John Mazor, an ALPA spokesman, refused to elaboarate on charges
of interference and declined to discuss the vote.
   The vote was sparked by Federal Express' $880 million purchase
earlier this year of Tiger International Inc., the parent of Flying
Tigers Inc., a cargo airline heavily involved in overseas business.
   Pilots with Flying Tigers were represented by ALPA, while pilots
with Federal Express were not. The merger raised questions about
seniority lists for pilots and other employment issues, pro-union
pilots said.
   In a statement, ALPA said it would continue meeting with Federal
Express pilots.

   Assets of the nation's 476 money market mutual
funds rose by $1.26 billion in the latest week to a new record of
$357.49 billion, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   The rise in the seven-day period ended Wednesday broke the
record set the previous week and marked the third straight weekly
all-time high for fund assets, the Washington-based mutual trade
fund group said.
   The previous record also was revised upward by the institute to
$356.23 billion from the $356.10 billion originally reported.
   The institute said that in the latest week, assets of 236
general purpose funds rose $300.10 million to $116.91 billion,
assets of 96 broker-dealer funds increased $1.72 billion to $155.76
billion, and assets of 144 institutional funds declined $751.4
million to $84.82 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in
the week ended Tuesday to 8.14 percent from 8.21 percent the
previous week, said Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade journal
based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell to 8.22 percent from 8.26 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
40 days, up from 38 days, Donoghue's said.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual
yield available on money market accounts fell to 6.40 percent as of
Wednesday from 6.41 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, fell to 5.09 percent from 5.10 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 8.20
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 8.22 the
previous week. Yields were 8.24 percent on 1-year CDs, down from
8.26 percent; 8.17 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 8.18 percent;
and 8.15 percent on 5-year CDs, down from 8.16 percent.

   It's time to toss out the stationery and tear
down the signs touting Pittsburgh as America's Most Livable City.
The title was lost to Seattle earlier this week, and officials had
to scurry to pull the slogan from promotional plugs.
   After more than four years of top billing, Pittsburgh has
slipped behind Seattle and San Francisco in Prentice Hall Travel
Books' 1989 edition of ``Places Rated Almanac,'' which arrived in
bookstores this week.
   ``I'm reading it everywhere I go _ `We're the No. 1 city,'''
said Pittsburgh Mayor Sophie Masloff. ``I've used it and it's been
in every speech I've made, practically.''
   Mrs. Masloff had to revise her speech at a ground-breaking
ceremony Thursday morning.
   ``I said, `We're now No. 3, but we believe in our hearts we're
still No. 1.'''
   At the Greater Pittsburgh Convention and Visitors Bureau,
officials were priding themselves on having had the words
``Pittsburgh's the One'' printed on the latest batch of lapel pins
and convention badges.
   The bureau had commissioned bumper stickers and pins proclaiming
Pittsburgh as America's Most Livable City soon after the title was
bestowed in 1985. None, fortunately, remain.
   ``We assumed that for a lot of reasons, it wouldn't last
forever,'' said Robert Imperata, the bureau's executive vice
president. ``We didn't want to get burned. `Pittsburgh's the One'
is a more generic phrase.''
   The Greater Pittsburgh Chamber of Commerce also is
congratulating itself on having waited before ordering new
stationery. Printed on the bottom of the current sheets are the
words ``The Most Livable City.''
   ``Of course ... we could have printed some more real quick'' if
Pittsburgh had retained its title, said Lance Shaeffer, the
chamber's executive vice president.
   ``I think what others will do, and what we're certainly going to
do, is to bill ourselves as a very livable city,'' he said.
   At Greater Pittsburgh International Airport, a banner reading
``Welcome to Pittsburgh, the Most Livable City'' and other similar
signs had been removed by Thursday.
   For Mrs. Masloff and other city officials, coming in third among
333 metropolitan areas is still reason for pride. Pittsburgh was
ranked fourth in 1981, making it the only city to be among the top
10 in each of the almanac's three editions.
   ``We're very philosophical,'' the mayor said. ``We feel being
No. 1 is being like Miss America or a heavyweight champion. You
never repeat.
   ``It's a title you will always retain and always be referred
to,'' agreed Kelly O'Toole, vice president of the Greater
Pittsburgh Office of Promotion.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Along with several hundred jobs, Exxon Corp. is
moving 107 years of history when it relocates its corporate
headquarters to Texas from midtown Manhattan.
   Since its creation in 1882 as Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey,
Exxon has grown from a domestic kerosene maker into the world's
largest multinational oil conglomerate, with 1988 sales of $87.5
billion and more than 180,000 employees worldwide.
   On Thursday, Exxon announced it was moving its corporate
headquarters and 300 jobs to Dallas, joining a number of other
major companies that have left the Northeast in recent years for
the Sunbelt.
   Standard Oil of New Jersey was one of 40 separate petroleum
companies organized in 1882 under the Standard Oil Trust formed by
John D. Rockefeller.
   The original Standard Oil Co. was formed by Rockefeller in 1870
and incorporated in Ohio. In 1911, the Standard Oil organization
was dissolved under U.S. antitrust laws and the various companies
under the trust became independent.
   Standard Oil of New Jersey opened its first headquarters in
lower Manhattan, across New York harbor from its main facilities
that at that time included a paraffin plant, a barrel factory and a
refinery capable of processing 2,000 barrels a day of crude oil
shipped from oil fields in western Pennsylvania.
   In 1919, the company bought 50 percent interest in Humble Oil
and Refining, which eventually became Exxon U.S.A. based in Houston.
   In 1972, Standard Oil of New Jersey changed its name to Exxon
Corp. Before changing its name, the company marketed gasoline and
other products under a variety of trademarks, including Standard,
Esso, Humble and Carter. Many of its overseas affiliates still use
the name Esso.
   Since its founding, Exxon has expanded to 100 countries
worldwide, exploring, producing, refining and marketing oil. Its
businesses also include coal, hydrocarbon energy, natural gas,
rubber, minerals mining and nuclear energy and high technology.
   Exxon now owns or has interests in 25,000 miles of underground
pipelines _ enough to circle the earth at the equator _ and
maintains one of the world's biggest fleets of oil-transporting
vessels.
   It has refineries in 25 countries. Its five U.S. refineries are
capable of processing about 1.5 million barrels a day of crude oil
into some 1,000 products, ranging from motor fuels to special
lubricants for use in outer space.
   Exxon's leadership history includes such corporate figures as
Rockefeller himself, who served as chairman from 1899 to 1911.
   The place of Lawrence G. Rawl, who has been chairman since
January 1987, in company annals has been marked by one of the most
tumultuous periods in Exxon's history.
   A March 24 oil spill by an Exxon tanker in Alaska's Prince
William Sound was the nation's worst such disaster ever, and has
subjected the company to harsh criticism by politicians,
environmentalists and consumer groups.
   Exxon's home base shared in the ignominy in May, when people
claiming to be Alaskans protested the spill by dumping oil into the
fountain outside the midtown Manhattan skyscraper that houses the
company's corporate headquarters.
   The company offices are in a landmark, 54-story skyscraper known
as the Exxon Building. Exxon and Rockefeller Group Inc. sold the
building in 1986 to a large Japanese insurance conglomerate, Mitsui
&amp; Co. for $610 million _ at the time the largest single real estate
transaction in Manhattan history.

   The stock market sustained a broad loss Thursday
in selling attributed to increasing concern over the outlook for
corporate earnings.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 39.55 to 2,613.73,
bringing its drop over the last four sessions to 75.41 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 11 to 4 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
406 up, 1,141 down and 410 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 175.24 million
shares, against 155.65 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 204.16 million shares.
   Before the opening the Commerce Department reported that the
gross national product grew at a 2.5 percent annual rate, after
adjustment for inflation, in the third quarter.
   That matched the increase posted for the second quarter and was
in line with, or slightly stronger than, advance estimates in the
financial world.
   But observers also said the report showed a buildup of
inventories that betokened continued problems for the manufacturing
sector of the economy, which has been struggling of late.
   In addition also noted worries about corporate profits,
intensified by a series of disappointing reports from individual
companies in recent weeks.
   A tally of the latest quarterly reports from some 430 companies
by Prudential-Bache Securities through the end of last week led the
firm to conclude that ``so far we're looking at a very
disappointing quarter.
   ``Almost twice as many companies have reported negative
surprises as positive surprises,'' said Melissa Brown, a
Prudential-Bache analyst.
   Compaq Computer fell 8| to 100. Late Wednesday the company
reported a third-quarter earnings gain that came up short of
expectations, and anlysts also cited uncertainty over the company's
fourth-quarter prospects.
   Anheuser Busch lost { to 38 on top of a 4]-point drop Wednesday,
when the company posted a smaller-than-expected profit increase for
the third quarter and said it was planning a price-cutting strategy
for its beers.
   Philip Morris, whose Miller Brewing operation competes with
Busch, dropped 1~ to 41|.
   In the auto group, where operating earnings for the third
quarter were lower at all of the Big Three domestic manufacturers,
General Motors slipped { to 44]; Ford Motor ] to 47{, and Chrysler
] at 22\.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $40.47 billion, or 1.21
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 2.30 to 187.22.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 5.73 to 385.19, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down 4.57 at 337.93.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
slumped 4.74 to 458.15. On the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 373.48, down 2.44.

   The dollar gained against most major currencies
in U.S. trading Thursday, particularly the British pound, which
plunged after the country's Treasury chief announced his
resignation.
   Gold prices rose. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold
bullion for current delivery settled at $372.50 a troy ounce, up
$3.40 from Wednesday. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted
an ounce of gold at $371.10 as of 4 p.m. EDT, $2.60 higher than
Wednesday's late bid.
   Currency dealers unloaded sterling and bought dollars and West
German marks following news of Nigel Lawson's decision to leave
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Cabinet.
   Lawson, who had served as chancellor of the exchequer since
1983, said he was resigning because of differences with the prime
minister's economic adviser, Sir Alan Walters.
   The pound, which had been quoted at $1.6130 when most trading
ended in London, sank to $1.5995 on the few European markets still
open after Lawson's sudden announcement. Later, in New York,
sterling fetched $1.5780, down sharply from $1.6143 on Wednesday.
   Central banks, including the Federal Reserve, reportedly bought
sterling to cushion its collapse, dealers said.
   Even though the British government quickly appointed a
replacement for Lawson, sterling was expected to remain under
pressure with financial markets questioning the stability of
Britain's economic policies.
   Lawson recently had been stressing the importance of a firm
pound as part of the government's fight against inflation.
   Mrs. Thatcher announced that her foreign secretary, John Major,
would take over at the Treasury.
   John McCarthy, chief dealer at the New York office of the
Amsterdam Rotterdam Bank, said apart from the impact of the
sterling selloff, the dollar did not do much during most of the
session.
   ``We were having a rather quiet day'' until word came of
Lawson's resignation, said McCarthy, noting that a report on U.S.
economic growth elicited little response from traders.
   The report that the economy grew at a 2.5 percent annual rate in
the third quarter was consistent with market expectations. The
Commerce Department's reading on the gross national product, the
broadest gauge of economic health, matched the second-quarter
increase.
   The dollar began its trading day in Tokyo by rising to a closing
level of 141.90 yen, up 0.35 yen from late Wednesday. Later in
London, the dollar traded at 141.58 yen. The dollar ended New York
trading at 142.125 yen, up from 141.57 late Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Wednesday's
quotes, included: 1.8410 West German marks, up from 1.8350; 1.6115
Swiss francs, up from 1.6075; 6.2545 French francs, up from 6.2270;
1.17545 Canadian dollars, unchanged; and 1,351.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,345.00.
   Late rates for the dollar in Europe, compared with late
Wednesday's rates were: 1.8390 West German marks, down from 1.8410;
1.6085 Swiss francs, down from 1.6229; 6.2455 French francs, down
from 6.2520; 2.0810 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0740; 1,347.75
Italian lire, down from 1,350.00; and, 1.1750 Canadian dollars, up
from 1.1745.
   On precious metals markets abroad, gold traded at a late bid of
$369 a troy ounce in London, up from $368.25 bid late Wednesday.
   In Zurich, the metal dropped to a closing bid of $368.25 from
$368.70 bid late Wednesday.
   Gold in Hong Kong rose 11 cents to close at a bid of $368.70 per
troy ounce.
   Silver bullion rose in London to a late bid price of $5.13 a
troy ounce from $5.11 bid late Wednesday. On New York's Comex
silver bullion for current delivery rose to $5.194 an ounce from
Wednesday's settlement of $5.114.

   The announcement Monday that Exxon Corp. is
moving its headquarters to Dallas raised anew the question of
whether costly, crowded New York can continue competing with the
rest of the country's offerings.
   Exxon was only the latest corporate giant to move elsewhere in
search of cheaper space.
   J.C. Penney Co. Inc. moved its headquarters to the Dallas-Ft.
Worth area in 1987, saving about $60 million a year in office and
administration expenses. Mobil Corp. that same year announced plans
to move its headquarters to Virginia over three years.
   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. announced earlier this year that it was
moving 2,600 back-office jobs to New Jersey from Manhattan in 1992.
Bankers Trust New York Corp., PaineWebber Inc. and Donaldson Lufkin
&amp; Jenrette Inc. have moved thousands of jobs from New York to New
Jersey in the last four years.
   But city officials say the losses have been offset to an extent
and the city economy remains vibrant.
   RJR Nabisco Inc., for example, is moving its headquarters from
Atlanta to New York. Numerous other companies have been convinced _
by tax breaks and other incentives _ to stay put.
   ``No matter how you stack it up, we're a net winner,'' said
Stanley E. Grayson, deputy mayor for finance and economic
development, who said the city had gained 4,500 new companies in
the past 10 years.
   ``Although Exxon is certainly a major company in New York, in
the country and the world, the practical matter is they employed
300 people here,'' he said.
   ``If it was 30,000 jobs, it would be a lot more troubling,''
said Ray Horton, chairman of the Citizens Budget Commission and a
professor at the Graduate School of Business at Columbia University.
   New York's economy boomed for most of the 1980s, and although
the 1987 stock market crash slowed the economy the city shows net
job growth since then.
   ``The trend is that far more stay than actually leave,'' said
Claire Tallarico, spokeswoman for the Office for Economic
Development.
   ``People stay because this is the world's decision center. It is
the capital of commerce, the capital of communications, the capital
of banking,'' she said.
   The announcements in 1987 that Mobil Oil and J.C. Penney were
moving their headquarters out of the city gave the impression that
New York was losing its grip.
   When the National Broadcasting Co. threatened to move to New
Jersey the same year, the city offered $100 million in tax breaks
and other incentives that persuaded NBC to stay.
   Among the others that decided against moving jobs out of New
York in the past two years are Chase Manhattan, Drexel Burnham
Lambert, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, Shearson Lehman Hutton and
Citicorp.
   ``I would say that certainly any city that loses a corporate
headquarters ought to be worried about it, particularly when
they're moving from high-cost locations to low-cost locations,''
said Dennis J. Donovan, head of the business relocation division of
Moran, Stahl &amp; Boyer, a consulting firm.
   ``I would say it's not a trend. It was a trend in the late '60s,
early '70s, because the cost differentials were so staggering. ...
Again, I don't see it as a stampede or trend, but there are other
corporations that will consider leaving, and New York ought to do
everything it can to hold on to them,'' Donovan said.

<HEAD>McDonald's Announces Major Foam Recycling Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McDonald's Corp. announced Thursday its
restaurants in New England would join forces with a consortium of
chemical companies to launch a major recycling effort for plastic
food containers.
   McDonald's is undertaking the program with the National
Polystyrene Recycling Co., a joint venture formed earlier this year
by several leading producers of plastics, including Amoco Chemical
Co., Dow Chemical Co. and ARCO Chemical Co.
   Polystyrene products, which are not biodegradable, have received
criticism around the country, as more than a dozen cities have
enacted bans on the plastic products.
   But officials who spoke at a news conference at a downtown
McDonald's said garbage problems cannot be solved simply by
switching to more biodegradable materials.
   ``Where we have a shortage of space in landfills, the solution
lies in putting in less,'' said Shelby Yastrow, McDonald's senior
vice president.
   Ken Harman, acting chairman of the NPRC and director of styrene
products for Dow, said landfills inhibit all products from
biodegrading, so ``to put paper in instead of plastic, you don't
really accomplish anything.''
   The recycling company has set a goal to recycle 250 million
pounds of polystyrene per year by 1995, an amount equal to 25
percent of the polystyrene produced in the United States for food
service and packaging each year.
   Harman said New England is serving as the launch site for the
program because the company has acquired Plastics Again, a
recycling plant in Leominster.
   ``Here, we're ready,'' he said. ``We have a plant. We have a
capability.''
   The company said it plans to establish four other regional
recycling centers by the end of 1990. These centers are planned for
Chicago, Philadelphia, southern California and the San Francisco
area.
   Under the program with McDonald's, restaurant customers will be
asked to place their polystyrene foam containers, utensils, salad
containers, hot drink and sundae cups in special trash bins marked
``for recyclable plastic only.''
   After the recyclable material is taken to the Leominster plant,
it will be turned into plastic resins, which then will be sold to
companies that manufacture plastic products.
   Customers are already being asked to separate their plastic
waste at 100 McDonald's restaurants in New England, Yastrow said,
and about 450 restaurants are expected to be participating by early
next year.
   Based on initial tests, McDonald's expects 70 percent of its
polystyrene waste products will be turned in for recycling, Yastrow
said.
   Richard Denison, a senior scientist with the Environmental
Defense Fund, said he was encouraged by McDonald's efforts.
   ``Providing customers with an ability to recycle in their stores
is an important first step,'' Denison said in an interview from
Washington, D.C.
   But Denison said the program also could have limitations.
   ``It only affects customers who eat in,'' he said. ``People who
take materials out of the store would have to be awfully ambitious
to participate in this.''
   McDonald's officials estimate that at restaurants equipped with
drive-in windows, 40 percent to 50 percent of its customers use
that service.
   But Yastrow expressed hope that people who take their food away
from the restaurants will separate their plastic items once they
learn about the effort.
   In fact, officials said educating customers about recycling was
a key part of the program.
   ``We need to have more initiatives like the one we're seeing
today,'' said Paul Keough, acting regional administrator for the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. ``I hope that it's wildly
successful and will be copied around the country,''
   Tom Tomaszek, general manager of Plastics Again in Leominster,
noted that next month, Sturbridge is scheduled to start what is
believed to be the first community program for separating
polystyrene products.

<HEAD>Third-Quarter Earnings Tumble for Big Three</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Summertime sales incentives eroded the Big Three
automakers' third-quarter profits, which skidded a combined 27.3
percent from record levels a year ago, the companies reported
Thursday.
   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. each
said rebates and other inducements to lure buyers during the
July-September period were much costlier this year and were largely
responsible for the weakness.
   The combined earnings for the Big Three during the three-month
period was $1.33 billion on revenues of $56.92 billion. That
compared with an industry third-quarter record profit last year of
$1.83 billion on revenues of $56.48 billion.
   ``I don't think it was a real big surprise,'' said analyst Paul
Kleinaitis of Duff &amp; Phelps, a Chicago investment research concern.
   Boosting the Big Three's total profit figure was a one-time,
$309 million increase in Chrysler's profits stemming from the sale
of some of its stock in Mitsubishi Motors Corp. in Japan during the
quarter.
   If that stock sale were removed, Big Three quarterly profits
would be $1.02 billion, 44.2 percent below last year's level.
   GM's earnings fell 40 percent and Ford's income dropped 44.3
percent during the period. Chrysler's profits nearly tripled on the
strength of the Mitsubishi stock sale, but without that boost, the
company's earnings plummeted 80.4 percent.
   Once again, Ford and GM profits benefited from overseas
operations. Chrysler has few overseas operations. Ford Vice
President and Treasurer David McCammon said his company lost $37
million during the quarter domestically, mostly because of
incentives that averaged $800 a vehicle.
   GM spokesman Terry Sullivan and Chrysler spokesman Tom Houston
declined to say how much their companies spent on incentives.
   Sullivan also declined to give North American profit figures for
the third quarter, but said that so far this year, all major
segments of GM business are profitable.
   The size of the drop at Ford caused some anxiety among industry
analysts, largely because the automaker has been so successful in
making itself one of the most profitable companies in the world in
recent years.
   ``That is a little worse than I expected,'' Kleinaitis said of
the Ford decline. ``If Ford lost money, you can imagine that GM was
cleaned out.''
   Profit-sharing amounts for auto workers are based on a formula
rooted in North American earnings. Earlier this year, Ford workers
got about $2,800 each, Chrysler workers got checks for about $720
apiece and GM employees got about $265 each in profit-sharing based
on 1988 North American earnings.
   That's likely to change next spring when profit-sharing checks
for 1989 business are calculated.
   ``Profit sharing will be down for the U.S. workers and will be
down substantially,'' McCammon said. However he said the checks
still would be ``meaningful'' and more than those for GM or
Chrysler workers.
   GM, the nation's largest automaker, said it earned $516.9
million on revenue of $28.79 billion during the period this year,
compared with $859.2 million on revenue of $28.22 billion during
the same time last year.
   GM's profits could not be translated directly to a per-share
basis because of a complex system of ownership of GM common, Class
E and Class H stocks.
   For the first nine months of the year, GM reported earnings of
$3.52 billion, up 1.7 percent from profits of $3.46 billion in the
January-September period last year.
   GM's nine-month revenue totaled $95.57 billion, up from $91.21
billion a year ago.
   No. 2 Ford said it earned $477.1 million, or $1.03 per share of
common stock, during the third quarter this year, compared with
$856.3 million, or $1.78 a share, during the same time last year.
Revenue fell to $20.24 billion during the period this year from
$20.38 billion in the third quarter of 1988.
   For the first nine months of the year, Ford's earnings were down
15 percent to $3.52 billion, or $7.51 a share, from $4.14 billion,
or $8.53 a share. Revenue rose to $72 billion from $68.53 billion.
   Chrysler, the nation's third-largest automaker, said it earned
$331 million, or $1.42 a share, during the third quarter, compared
with $112.5 million, or 50 cents a share, during the July-September
period last year.
   Without the $309 million infusion from the Mitsubishi stock
sale, Chrysler's third-quarter profits would been $22 million, or
10 cents a share.
   Chrysler's $7.88 billion in revenue for the quarter matched its
revenue for the same period a year earlier.
   For the first nine months of the year, Chrysler's profits rose
15.8 percent to $714 million, or $3.06 a share, excluding profits
from the Mitsubishi sale. With the stock sale worked in, Chrysler's
nine-month profit rose 65.9 percent to $1.02 billion, or $4.38 a
share.
   Chrysler's revenue for the first nine months of this year rose
to $27.95 billion, up from revenue of $25.78 billion during the
same time last year.
   ``It's been a tough quarter,'' Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca
said.

<HEAD>AT&amp;T Files Countersuit Against MCI Over Advertising</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. on Thursday
answered a false advertising lawsuit that MCI Communications Corp.
filed 2{ weeks ago with a countersuit that contends MCI's ads
deceive the public.
   MCI's long-distance phone advertising ``has misled customers
about prices, about the quality and reach of its service and about
its facsimile service,'' Victor Pelson, AT&amp;T group executive, told
reporters in announcing the countersuit.
   ``MCI, instead of cleaning up its own advertising act, had the
gall to file a lawsuit,'' Pelson said. ``We stand by our
advertising.''
   AT&amp;T's U.S. District Court lawsuit denies the allegations in
MCI's Oct. 10 legal complaint and asks the court to enjoin MCI from
making false or deceptive representations with respect to the
price, quality, features or any other aspect of any MCI service.
   It asks the court to order MCI to make court-approved corrective
ads ``to mitigate the lingering effects of the misrepresentations.''
   AT&amp;T's lawsuit also seeks unspecified profits ``wrongfully
amassed by MCI on the sale of its products or services during the
period in question,'' plus triple the damages that AT&amp;T has
sustained because of the ads and legal and court costs.
   ``We are amazed that AT&amp;T should label as absurd MCI's claim
that 100,000 customers a week are switching to it from AT&amp;T, yet
failed to challenge it in court,'' MCI spokeswoman Kathleen Keegan
said. ``The most significant thing about AT&amp;T's countersuit was
what was not in it.''
   Keegan said MCI planned to seek an injunction against AT&amp;T's ads
soon.
   The lawsuits are the latest chapters in MCI's long battle with
AT&amp;T, which began in the 1970s when MCI successfully broke AT&amp;T's
long-distance monopoly.
   AT&amp;T says it has about 70 percent of the long-distance market,
as measured by interstate and intrastate revenues. MCI is No. 2
with more than 10 percent.
   MCI's lawsuit claimed AT&amp;T was trying to protect its eroding
share of the long-distance market through maliciously false and
deceptive advertising.
   The MCI lawsuit said that beginning in January this year, AT&amp;T
launched a counterattack against its competitors to regain market
share and in July began targeting MCI's new Primetime, cut-rate
long-distance calling plan.
   MCI Chairman William McGowan said at the time of the filing that
AT&amp;T was losing 100,000 customers a week, and ``they are panicking
about it.''
   Pelson said McGowan's claim was ``absurd.''
   Merrill Tutton, AT&amp;T vice president consumer services, cited an
MCI ad that claims ``MCI always saves you money.''
   He said MCI was making ``apples and oranges'' comparisons
between its cut-rate calling plans and AT&amp;T's standard
long-distance rates.
   ``We want to inform our customers of the facts,'' Tutton said.
   He defended an ad that had particularly incensed McGowan _ one
showing a satellite picture of the earth with a quarter segment of
the planet missing, including Europe, the Middle East and North
Africa. The ad copy says ``Is this how your worldwide long-distance
company sees the world?''
   MCI's lawsuit had asked court to enjoin AT&amp;T from making false
or deceptive representations that any AT&amp;T service is superior or
that MCI has misrepresented its services or rates.

<HEAD>Wheat Falls Below $4 On Export Dismay</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat futures prices fell below $4 a bushel for the first time
in a month Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting
disappointment that a newly expanded Soviet grain deal contains no
incentives to boost wheat sales.
   Corn prices rose in Chicago while soybeans were mixed.
   On other futures markets, cocoa hit a new 16-year low; copper
fell and precious metals climbed as the stock market dropped nearly
40 points; stock-index futures plunged; energy futures were mostly
lower, and livestock and meat futures largely fell.
   Wheat futures settled 1} cents to 7 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in December at $3.98{ a bushel, its lowest
settlement price since Sept. 28.
   Corn futures were } cent to 2{ cents higher with December at
$2.44} a bushel; oats were \ cent lower to { cent higher with
December at $1.45} a bushel; soybeans were 1{ cents lower to } cent
higher with November at $5.66{ a bushel.
   The Agriculture Department announced late Wednesday it had given
the Soviet Union approval to buy an additional 4 million metric
tons of grain in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, raising the
ceiling to 16 million tons.
   But the expanded deal does not require the Soviets to first
fulfill a 4 million-ton wheat purchase requirement contained in the
original program.
   The original deal also requires the Soviets to buy at least 4
million tons of corn but they have already exceeded that amount.
Soviet purchases of U.S. corn totaling 4 million tons were
announced last week alone.
   Meanwhile, the Russians have bought just 1.2 million tons of
wheat since June 1, said Ted Mao, grain specialist with Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc.
   ``Corn is the commodity of choice,'' he said. ``And even though
they will buy 4 million wheat, it looks like that business will
come later rather than sooner.''
   Analyst Katharina Zimmer of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc.
said there were indications the Soviets recently bought wheat from
Canada and England. And with last week's corn purchases, she said,
the grain pipeline to Russia is full.
   ``Nobody expects the Russians to be back tomorrow to buy more
corn _ or wheat for that matter,'' she said.
   Cocoa futures plunged to new 16-year-lows on New York's Coffee,
Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange following news that Brazil, the world's
second-largest producer, was suspending a 10 percent tax on cocoa
exports. The move is likely to add more cocoa to an already
overburdened market.
   Cocoa settled $24 to $38 lower with December at $961 a ton.
   Copper futures sank to new 2{-month lows on New York's Commodity
Exchange as the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 39.55 points,
contributing to fears of a recession-related drop in copper demand.
   Copper settled .25 cent to 1.6 cents lower with December at
$1.142 a pound.
   The stock market's plunge also sent investors scurrying for the
perceived safety of precious metals. Gold futures settled $3.10 to
$3.60 higher on the Comex with December at $375.40 a troy ounce;
silver was 7.7 cents to 8.4 cents higher with December at $5.237 a
troy ounce.
   The selloff in stocks was reflected in stock-index futures
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, where the contract for
December delivery of stocks tracked by the Standard &amp; Poor's 500
index settled 5.1 points lower at 339.55. The contract is worth
$500 a point.
   Stock-market jitters also got some of the blame for
significantly lower livestock and meat futures prices on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle settled .17 cent to .57 cent lower with December at
74.65 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .80 cent lower to .02 cent
higher with October at 83.07 cents a pound; live hogs were .02 cent
to .83 cent lower with December at 46.97 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .70 cent to .87 cent lower with February at 52.45
cents a pound.
   Energy futures worked lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange
amid a dearth of fresh suppy-and-demand developments.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 18 cents to 25 cents
lower with December at $19.38 a barrel; heating oil was .61 cent to
1.2 cents lower with November at 57.24 a gallon; unleaded gasoline
was .24 cent lower to .23 cent higher with November at 53.63 cents
a gallon.

   Petroleum futures prices ended mixed Thursday as
crude oil prices weakened for the fourth straight day mainly
because of internal market conditions of supply and demand.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the December contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil,
fell 24 cents to finish at $19.38 a barrel. Other contracts also
declined.
   Among refined oil products traded on the exchange, wholesale
heating oil also fell. The contract for November delivery lost 1.20
cents to close at 57.24 cents and the December contract dropped
1.11 cents to 57.56 cents a gallon.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for November rose 0.23 cent to end
at 53.63 cents a gallon while the December contract gained 0.07
cent to 52.85 cents.
   Analysts said the market's recent weakness was driven by
technical factors after an 11-week rise in prices.
   ``The uptrend was led by product prices and now the downward
move is also product led,'' said Michael Broder, energy trader with
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Peter Beutel, assistant director of the energy group at Elders
Futures Inc., said that seasonal weakness also appeared to have hit
the market.
   ``Prices usually decline from about the second week in November
to December,'' Beutel said. ``It seems to be occurring early this
year.''

<HEAD>Average Private Contract Wage Gains Put at 3.1 Percent Annually</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Private-sector workers who got new contracts
through collective bargaining from January through September won
average annual wage increases of 3.1 percent compared to average
gains of 2.4 percent in their prior contracts, the Labor Department
said Thursday.
   The data covers contracts for 1.3 million workers negotiated in
the first nine months of the year. If the trend continues for the
final three months, 1989 would be the first year since 1981 in
which new contracts provide workers with better pay raises, on
average, than their prior contracts, the department said.
   The rebound in wage gains was attributed to the restoration of
prior concessions in several industries that were slumping earlier
in the decade, particularly the U.S. steel industry.
   Also, the Labor Department said wage increases given to workers
in the health care sector, particularly nurses, were outpacing the
gains provided in prior contracts. Competition for skilled workers
in that sector has pushed wages higher.
   The department's Bureau of Labor Statistics tracks collective
bargaining agreements affecting 6 million workers in bargaining
units of at least 1,000 employees.
   Contracts affecting an additional 903,000 workers in the private
sector are up for collective bargaining in the fourth quarter. More
than one-third of those workers are rail workers, the government
said.
   Most of the settlements reached in the first nine months of the
year, 81 percent covering 1 million of the 1.3 million workers,
were in non-manufacturing sectors. About one-third of those were in
the construction industry, where settlements called for average
annual wage increases of 3.0 percent. The settlements in the other
non-manufacturing sectors, primarily communications, food stores
and utilities, provided average annual pay hikes of 3.3 percent,
the government said.
   In manufacturing, a sector which has slumped most of the year,
the settlements provided lower wage adjustments, averaging 2.9
percent a year over the life of the new contracts.

   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended Oct. 16, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,179 billion from $3,171.3 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted
$4,030.0 billion from $4,017.2 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted $789.0 billion from $786.9 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 4.3 percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The annual growth rate in M3 is 3.7 percent, which is within the
Fed's target range of 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent. The Fed has not
set a target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,147.3 billion, a 7.9
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,013.8 billion, up 4.2 percent, while M1
rose 2.9 percent to an average of $780.6 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $356 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, down from
$468 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve said net free reserves averaged $301
million in the two weeks ended Oct. 18, up from $50 million in the
previous two-week period.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $293.8 billion in the two-week period ended
Oct. 18, up from $291.7 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>GM Seeking Clearance to Buy up to 15 Percent of Jaguar</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. is seeking U.S. regulatory
clearance to purchase up to 15 percent of Jaguar PLC, a GM
spokesman said Thursday.
   Jaguar, which wants to remain independent and faces a possible
takeover bid from Ford Motor Co., has been talking with GM about a
cooperation agreement that would involve GM, the world's biggest
auto maker, buying a minority stake in Jaguar.
   GM's filing for regulatory clearance was within the context of
those talks, sources said.
   The GM spokesman, reached in London, confirmed the company had
made a filing with the Federal Trade Commission, which must approve
major share acquisitions involving U.S. companies under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.
   The spokesman declined to say when the filing was made, but
sources close to GM and Jaguar said it was sometime last week.
   Under U.S. regulations, a company may begin the intended stock
purchase if the FTC has raised no objection within 30 days.
   Until it receives FTC clearance, GM will be limited to buying no
more than $15 million worth of Jaguar shares.
   Ford said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission Monday it was prepared to bid for all outstanding Jaguar
stock when takeover restrictions are lifted at the end of 1990.
   Jaguar bylaws prevent any outside individual or company
acquiring more than 15 percent of its stock before Dec. 31, 1990.
   Ford announced Sept. 19 that it planned to acquire 15 percent of
Jaguar's stock, and received U.S. regulatory approval for the
purchase. By Tuesday, Ford had accumulated 12.45 percent of the
stock.
   Jaguar has called Ford's move unwelcome.
   Jaguar Chairman John Egan has said he hopes to announce a deal
with GM by mid-November.

<HEAD>FCC Backs McCaw Effort to Acquire LIN Broadcasting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission upheld
on Thursday staff decisions granting the applications of McCaw
Cellular Communications Inc. to acquire control of LIN Broadcasting
Corp.
   On Aug. 31, the FCC's mass media and common carrier bureaus
granted McCaw's transfer applications and denied counter-petitions
filed by LIN and others who objected to the requests.
   The New York-based LIN, which has interests in cellular
telephones, television stations and specialty publishing, has
resisted McCaw's nearly five-month takeover effort and appealed the
bureaus' actions.
   The commission concluded that ``it should not engage in
comparisons of the transferee and transferor in determining whether
grant of the transfer will serve the public interest.''
   Further, the commission said hostile takeover cases should not
be considered differently than other transfer cases. The commission
also said it will not generally consider an applicant's level of
debt when assessing the applicant's financial qualifications.
   The commission said McCaw has demonstrated ``reasonable
assurance of acquisition financing from three prominent banks.''
   McCaw, which already owns 5.1 million on LIN's shares, has
offered $125 a share, or $2.75 billion, for an additional 22
million LIN shares. That would give McCaw about 50.3 percent of
LIN's stock.
   LIN's board has taken no position on the offer, but previously
agreed to merge its cellular operations with those of BellSouth
Corp., the regional telephone company based in Atlanta.
   The McCaw offer is scheduled to expire at midnight Friday.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The stock of Compaq Computer Corp. tumbled 8
percent Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange in response to a
disappointing earnings report and news of a problem with a critical
computer chip.
   The Houston-based personal computer maker said it uncovered two
minor flaws in the i486 microprocessor made by Intel Corp., which
will be the brains of a major new computer it is introducing next
month.
   Intel confirmed that two flaws had been discovered by a
customer, which it did not identify, and said it would begin
shipping a fixed version of the chip by the end of November.
   One flaw involves trigonometric functions and another involves a
feature that detects irregular operations such as attempting to
divide by zero. Both occur only under special conditions and would
not affect most users, according to Bill Rash, Intel's marketing
directorfor the i486.
   Compaq's stock fell $8.62{ to $100 a share on the NYSE in heavy
trading, while Intel's held up better, losing just 87{ cents to $32
a share in over-the-counter trading.
   Compaq reported Wednesday that its earnings jumped 51 percent in
the third quarter, but part of the increase came from a gain in the
carrying value of its investment in a disk-drive maker, Conner
Peripherals Inc. The earnings were at the low end of analysts'
expectations.

   When it's all counted up, the damage from
Hurricane Hugo may exceed $8 billion, the director of the National
Hurricane Center said Thursday.
   Robert Sheets told a Senate committee that damage from the
September storm could climb to the $8 billion to $10 billion level,
in his opinion.
   The insurance industry is currently estimating its losses at $4
billion, Sheets said. ``In the past we have found that total losses
get close to two to three times the insurance loss,'' he told the
Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.
   ``I've never seen such massive damage as with Hurricane Hugo,''
said Sheets, who has toured the damaged regions, including South
Carolina's coastal zones.
   Sheets said the nation was somewhat lucky with Hugo, because the
storm struck in such a way that the most powerful wind and waves
slammed into the Francis Marion National Forest, an area with few
human residents.
   If it had struck a major metropolitan area, the destruction
would have been much greater, he said.
   Sheets' comments came at a hearing on modernization of the
National Weather Service, and he pointed out that improved weather
radars planned for the future will make hurricane forecasting
easier and more accurate.
   Sens. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., and Ted Stevens, R-Alaska,
questioned the proposed cuts in Weather Service offices planned
over the next decade under the modernization.
   The improved technology will mean that the National Weather
Service will be able to give the same or better service with fewer
offices, contended John Knauss, director of the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration.
   ``The whole point ... is top provide better service, '' he said.
``We guarantee we will not provide any less service in any
location. If we can't do that, we will not close the station.''
Knauss said.
   Stevens indicated disbelief, saying that cutting from 10 weather
stations to three in Alaska could have serious results in a state
where aviation and fishing are major activities.
   Elbert W. Friday, director of the National Weather Service, said
new radar systems will dramatically improve forecasting of storms.
In tests at Norman, Okla., the radars improved prediction of severe
weather from 58 percent to 91 percent, he said.
   The installation of new radars will provide improved coverage of
Alaska, he said, especially along the coastline.
   ``We've proven the technology so far. We've proven the science
so far ...'' said Friday.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. economy shrugged off Hurricane Hugo
and the poorest trade performance in six years to grow at a
moderate 2.5 percent annual rate from July through September, the
Commerce Department reported Thursday.
   The department said that the increase in the gross national
product, the country's total output of goods and services, was
accompanied by a dramatic slowing of the inflation rate. A price
index tied to the GNP rose at an annual rate of 2.9 percent, the
slowest in three years, as both energy and food costs moderated.
   The combination of moderate growth and lower inflation was
hailed by the Bush administration, but many private economists said
the big deterioration in the trade deficit and a buildup of unsold
business inventories posed significant threats to the economy in
coming months.
   The stock market, reacting to the negative aspects of the GNP
report, turned down. The Dow Jones industrial average of 30 stocks
lost 39.55 point.
   Most of the economy's momentum in the third quarter came from a
boom in consumer spending, reflecting a rush to take advantage of
end-of-model-year price discounts. Purchases shot ahead at an
annual rate of 5.8 percent in the third quarter, the fastest
advance since the early part of 1988.
   Car sales in the first part of October have taken a nosedive and
because of this analysts believe that consumer spending, which
accounts for two-thirds of the overall economy, will be
substantially weaker in the final three months of the year.
   Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co., said he was
looking for the economy to grow at an anemic 1 percent annual rate
in the October-December period and he forecast that this would be
followed in 1990 with two consecutive small declines in the GNP,
indicating a mild recession.
   ``I think we are in for something harder than a soft landing,''
Sinai said. ``Businesses are facing a profits squeeze, residential
construction is weak and there is a major slowdown in exports. We
are flirting with a recession.''
   The Bush administration rejected the recession talk.
   On Capitol Hill, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, testifying
about the Friday the 13th stock market plunge, said he continued to
believe that the market's tailspin was not signaling that anything
was fundamentally wrong with the U.S. economy.
   Talking to reporters, Brady said, ``We have good solid growth in
this country and ... inflation is lower than what people expected
it to be.''
   He said that growth could slow in the fourth quarter but the
country would not dip into a recession.
   In his testimony, Brady came out in support of additional
reforms in the way financial markets are regulated, saying the
Securities and Exchange Commission should be able to halt trading
in times of emergencies, a power that now rests solely with the
president.
   In other economic news Thursday, the Labor Department said that
major collective bargaining contracts negotiated through the first
nine months of this year provided for annual wage increases of 3.1
percent.
   In a second report, the Labor Department said the cost of
imported goods dropped a sharp 1.3 percent in the third quarter,
reflecting the stronger dollar, which makes imports less expensive
for American consumers, and lower foreign oil costs.
   The stronger dollar was also cited as a major factor in the
deterioration of the country's trade deficit as measured by the
GNP, a figure that widened by a sharp $22.9 billion in the third
quarter. It was the worst trade number since the second quarter of
1983.
   Imports shot up by 15.1 percent while exports, which had been
one of the economy's brightest spots, showed no gain at all.
Analysts said this trade weakness was likely to continue for some
time, given the runup in the dollar's value in the past year.
   The 2.5 percent overall GNP increase was identical to the
advance from April through June and followed a 3.7 percent
January-March increase. For the first nine months of the year, the
economy has been growing at an annual rate of 2.9 percent.
   One factor acting as a drag on third quarter growth was a $4
billion loss in personal incomes resulting from Hurricane Hugo,
which struck the Carolinas in September.
   Some economists said that Hugo and the October 19 California
earthquake could actually end up boosting GNP growth in the fourth
quarter as construction spending is increased to repair the
devastation from both calamities.
   While some analysts saw dangers of a recession, others said they
believed the country would escape an outright downturn because the
Federal Reserve will act in time to lower interest rates as a spur
to growth, especially in view of signs that inflation is moderating.
   The 2.9 percent rate of increase in the GNP deflator, which
reflects a changing market-basket of goods, was down sharply from a
4.6 percent inflation rate in the second quarter.
   The various changes left the economy, after adjusting for
inflation, running at a total output of goods and services of an
annual rate of $4.158 trillion in the third quarter, up $25.6
billion from the second-quarter pace.

<HEAD>Delta Announces Cooperation Agreements with Singapore Airlines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Delta Air Lines Inc. said Thursday that it and
Singapore Airlines will make significant investments in each other
as part of agreements designed to promote and enhance cooperation
between the two carriers.
   Atlanta-based Delta said in a statement that the agreements
signed Thursday include a 10-year marketing pact and two equity
cross-purchase accords.
   Ronald W. Allen, Delta's chairman and chief executive officer,
said Singapore Airlines' worldwide route system, centered in the
Pacific and Southeast Asia, ``will strongly complement our own
domestic and emerging international operations.''
   Delta said the marketing agreement involves cooperation in
schedule coordination, code-sharing, blocked space purchase
arrangements and possible joint service on certain routes.
   Code sharing refers to a computer system under which a passenger
may purchase a single ticket for a route that involves flights on
both carriers.
   Under the other accords, Delta said, Singapore Airlines has
agreed to buy 2.5 million shares of Delta common stock at a price
equal to 110 percent of the average closing price of Delta shares
for the two days before and after the agreement was signed, and
Delta has agreed to buy the same dollar amount of Singapore shares
based on a similar formula.
   Allen said the agreements are similar to an arrangement reached
earlier this year with Swissair.
   Delta said the two carriers have agreed to certain limitations
on their ability to transfer the shares they are buying and on
future purchases of their stock.
   Delta said each carrier also has agreed to vote its shares in
the same proportion as other shares are voted or as recommended by
the other airline's board of directors.
   The agreements are subject to the approval of Singapore
Airlines' shareholders.
   Delta also announced Thursday that its board has authorized the
periodic repurchase of up to 2.5 million shares of outstanding
common stock.

<HEAD>Rorer Reports Profit Up 29 Percent in 3rd Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WASHINGTON, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The pharmaceutical company Rorer
Group Inc. reported a 29 percent increase in its third-quarter
profit Wednesday, crediting a boost in sales of its Maalox antacid.
   Net income totaled $19.6 million, or 54 cents a share, compared
with $15.2 million, or 48 cents a share, a year ago. Sales for the
quarter totaled $260 million, up from $244 million.
   Operating income for the quarter declined by more than 44
percent, from $37.2 million to $20.8 million, but the drop was more
than offset by the sale of assets to finance an ad campaign for
Maalox.
   Gains from the assets sales totaled $23.3 million _ primarily
from the sale of Asilone, an over-the-counter antacid sold in
Britain, and Thrombinar, a topical hemostatic product sold in the
United States.
   ``Our strategic initiative seems to be working,'' said Robert E.
Cawthorn, Rorer's chairman and chief executive officer. ``For the
first time, quarterly sales of Maalox in the U.S. were higher than
in 1988.
   ``We chose to fund the `Maalox Moments' campaign by selling
minor products whose proceeds will deliver a higher return invested
in Maalox.''
   For the first nine months of 1989, the company had net income of
$41.7 million, or $1.26 per share, compared with $34.9 million, or
$1.10 per share, in the 1988 period. Sales totaled $778 million, up
from $716 million in the first three quarters of 1988.

   Congress passed and sent legislation to
President Bush on Thursday to give a break to farmers who are
growing substitute crops on land where drought destroyed or damaged
earlier plantings.
   The bill eases restrictions on a federal disaster aid package
enacted earlier this year.
   It is intended to protect winter wheat and cotton farmers who
might receive no disaster payments for their lost crops under an
Agriculture Department plan even though the producers expect to
earn little or no profit on replacement crops such as grain sorghum
or soybeans.
   The legislation was approved Wednesday by the Senate and passed
the House on a voice vote Thursday with technical amendments. It
returned to the Senate later in the day and was approved easily.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said he was confident
that Bush would sign the legislation.
   The Agriculture Department, trying to prevent farmers from
reaping double benefits, has been planning to deduct 75 percent of
the gross value of any replacement crop from the disaster payment a
farmer would have otherwise received for losses on his first crop.
   Under the bill, that system would be modified.
   Farmers would have no payment deductions if the replacement
crops failed to produce more than 50 percent of the county average
yield for the second crop.
   But if the yield exceeded 50 percent of average yield, the
Agriculture Department's formula for deductions would kick in and
be applied only to the portion of the crop that exceeded the 50
percent mark.
   Under the Agriculture Department's initial plan, even farmers
who had replanted only a few acres would have to wait until
harvesting their second crop before obtaining disaster benefits for
damage to the first crop.
   That provision would be canceled under the legislation.

<TEXT>
   Telerate Inc., the financial data company,
planned to run an ad in The Wall Street Journal that criticized Dow
Jones &amp; Co., which owns two-thirds of Telerate's stock and
publishes the Journal. But the ad was pulled before it appeared in
print.
   The conflict between the companies stems from an offer by Dow
Jones to buy the shares of Telerate it doesn't own for what
Telerate called ``the low-ball price of $18 per share.''
   Telerate's management owns about 7 percent of the company's
stock; the remaining 26 percent is publicly held.
   Hours after people close to the Telerate board circulated copies
of the ad and said it had been submitted to the newspaper, the ad
was withdrawn, The New York Times reported in its Thursday editions.
   A person close to Telerate confirmed that the company withdrew
the ad but declined to say why, the Times reported.
   Roger B. May, a Dow Jones spokesman, said, ``It is Dow Jones'
understanding that the ad will not run, and that Telerate has
chosen not to run the ad at this time.''
   The ad, signed by Telerate's chief executive, urged shareholders
not to sell their stock to Dow Jones.
   Telerate has been resisting the bid for its remaining stock
since it was announced Sept. 20. Dow Jones has repeatedly described
the offer as fair.
   Telerate provides computer screens used in brokerage houses that
show stock transactions, oil prices, bond trading and a host of
other financial information.
