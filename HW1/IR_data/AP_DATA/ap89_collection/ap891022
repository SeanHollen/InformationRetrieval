   The major opposition group nominated
historian Lajos Fuer to run for president in multiparty elections,
group leaders said Sunday.
   The Hungarian Democratic Forum made the nomination at a
three-day congress that opened Friday as parliament ended a
landmark session in which it adopted laws to open the way for the
first multiparty parliamentary elections in more than 40 years.
   The elections are to be held next year but the presidential
balloting is to be held by the end of the year; no date has been
set. Subsequent presidents are to be appointed by the new
parliament.
   The ruling Socialist Party is backing Imre Pozsgay, a popular
reformer, as its presidential candidate.
   The parliament created the presidency in constitutional
amendments adopted at its last session.
   After his nomination Sunday, Fuer acknowledged that Pozsgay had
built up ``a media advantage,'' but he said he believed he still
had a ``good chance of winning.''
   The Democratic Forum claims 20,000 members.
   In his acceptance speech to the 850 delegates, Fuer said: ``We
can risk anything for democracy and for Hungary, but we cannot risk
Hungarian democracy for anything.''
   Fuer said he was dedicated to ``European Christian values.''
   He also praised Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, saying
that without ``his courage and (reform) initiatives, what is
happening now here could not have taken place.''
   The Democratic Forum is one of several prominent opposition
groups that signed an agreement with the Communist Party to hold
direct presidential elections before the end of the year.
   The Communist Party dissolved itself two weeks ago to create a
the new Socialist Party. That party professes democratic ideals but
continues to hold power until the multiparty elections.
   Delegates to the Democratic Forum's congress also elected Jozsef
Antall as their new chairman.
   Antall told a news conference that former chairman Zoltan Biro
had objected to the group nominating its own presidential candidate.
   Biro was quoted by the independent daily Mai Nap as saying he
considered Pozsgay a ``suitable'' presidential candidate.

<HEAD>Boeing, Machinists Leaders Talk, But Not To Each Other</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boeing Co.'s chairman and the Machinists union on
strike against the airplane builder planned to talk about the labor
dispute Monday, but not to each other.
   No new negotiation sessions were scheduled as the strike by
57,800 machinists nationwide enters its 20th day.
   Boeing chairman Frank Shrontz was scheduled to speak Monday to a
select group of media and business leaders on ``The Boeing Strike:
The Inside Story.'' The meeting before the Seattle Chamber of
Commerce Community Development Roundtable will be closed and none
of the comments can be published.
   Karen Keiser, communications director of the Washington State
Labor Council, said she objects that media leaders would agree to
such a gathering.
   ``These are the people who set the tone for news coverage, and
they're part of a secret group of the business leaders of
Seattle,'' she said. ``What kind of corporate dogma are they
learning in those meetings?''
   The labor council and Machinists union scheduled their own
briefing on the Boeing strike. Tom Baker, president of Machinists
District Lodge 751, planned to talk to labor leaders in an
on-the-record session open to the media and scheduled for the same
time as Shrontz's speech.
   Steve Leahy, a Seattle Chamber of Commerce vice president and
group secretary, said the off-the-record sessions permit speakers
to talk candidly without fear their remarks will turn up in
headlines. The speakers' remarks often are the same as those
they've already made in public forums, he said.
   The group, founded in 1933 by The Seattle Times and the chamber,
includes members from the Times, Seattle Post-Intelligencer and
Seattle television stations KOMO, KING and KIRO.
   Charles Dunsire, editorial page editor for the
Post-Intelligencer and a member of the group, said he considers the
meetings a valuable resource. He likened them to off-the-record
briefings given occasionally to newspaper editoral boards.
   ``If it were up to me, however, these meetings would be on the
record,'' Dunsire said.
   A Wednesday negotiating session called by federal mediator
Douglas Hammond ended with no progress after several hours.

   The halls are alive _ or soon will be alive _
with the sound of music emanating from the U.S. Embassy in Prague.
   Shirley Temple Black, the former child star and America's new
ambassador to Czechoslovakia, plans to form a singing group to help
keep mission personnel happy, Newsweek reports in its Oct. 30 issue.
   Since U.S. Embassy employees in that country are barred from
socializing with non-governmental Czech people, Black plans to
enliven the lives of the lonely Americans with song, the magazine
said.
   Her agenda includes learning the lyrics of ``The Sound of
Music,'' Christmas carols, ``and maybe we'll do charades,'' the
ambassador said.

   Advances in science and technology promise to
make the 10 years that begin this Jan. 1 a decade of unparalleled
accomplishment. But damage to the atmosphere, accumulation of solid
wastes, the spread of AIDS and other threats also make the 1990s a
decade of potential peril.
   ``By many measures, time is running out,'' warns Washington's
Worldwatch Institute.
   In a series of periodic articles over the next month, The
Associated Press will examine the progress and the challenges
expected in the coming decade in such areas as the environment,
medicine, space exploration, transportation, computer technology
and urban development.
   The articles, written by AP specialists, will discuss: the
``greenhouse effect'' and other atmospheric problems; cleaning up
solid wastes in the next decade; the U.S. energy picture; the
projected growth of the AIDS epidemic; prospects for progress
against heart disease and cancer; the future of artificial and
transplanted organs; the promise of genetic clues to disease; space
exploration in the 1990s; expected advances in mass transportation;
the automobiles of the '90s; the dazzling computer technology of
the next decade; the demographic outline of the United States in
the 1990s, and the expected urban sprawl of the 1990s.
   The series will end with a Media General-AP poll on what
ordinary Americans expect in the '90s, and a comprehensive article
offering an overview of the coming decade.

<TEXT>
   Film legend Fay Wray says she never
expected the story of a girl and her ape to have staying power.
   ``I thought `King Kong' was an unusual story at the time, but I
never thought it would have any endurance to speak of,'' said Ms.
Wray, 82, who is to appear here at a weekend film festival.
   Ms. Wray, a leading lady in 1930s films, said she feels her
career includes ``a small body of enduring work, I suppose, to look
back on with pride and affection, and somewhat more that I can
ignore in good conscience.''
   She retired once _ in 1942 _ but returned to acting in the 1950s
following her husband's death. She played character parts in
handful of forgettable movies, such as ``Tammy and the Bachelor''
and ``Dragstrip Riot.''
   She also has produced a number of stage plays and her
autobiography, ``On the Other Hand'' was issued last winter.
   Ms. Wray, who lives in New York, is scheduled to appear Friday
and Saturday at the USA Film Festival in Dallas, where she will
speak after screenings of ``King Kong,'' ``The Mystery of the Wax
Museum,'' and ``The Wedding March.''

<HEAD>Latin American Military Officials Learning Ways to Fight Drug Trade</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELLIOTT MINOR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Army's School of the Americas is
teaching officers from Latin America how to fight the narcotics
trade.
   ``The students are concerned about narcotics,'' said Col.
William A. DePalo Jr., commandant of the school at Fort Benning.
``They recognize it as not only a threat to the United States, but
it's now become apparent to them through an increased number of
drug addicts in their own countries.''
   The school, relocated from the Panama Canal Zone in 1984 under
the terms of the U.S.-Panama canal treaties, trains military
personnel from 18 Latin American nations, said DePalo.
   Six new courses are aimed at violent drug traffickers, DePalo
said. Subjects include use of ranger units, strategic intelligence
and disarming booby traps.
   The classes range in length from a month to a year. The school
has no structured semester-type system, and individual officers set
up their own schedules.
   DePalo, who is fluent in Spanish, visits a Latin American
country each month to meet with military leaders, to promote the
school and to make sure its courses are relevant.
   As far as winning the battle against drug trafficking, the key
will be in getting the countries to limit and supress the supply,
he said.
   ``They say we need to do more on our end in controlling
consumption and they're right,'' DePalo said. ``This thing has to
be attacked consistently and unrelentingly, but at least the
American public has awakened to the fact, it appears, that this is
a serious national security threat, more serious than the Soviet
Union at this point.''
   The School of the Americas, founded in Panama in 1947, has
trained more than 50,000 officers and enlisted military personnel
from Latin America. It moved to the United States in 1984 after
this country and Panama were unable to reach an agreement that
would have kept it operating in Panama.

   Five Soviet engineers came to study
building design. Nine Mexicans flew in to check disaster
preparedness. Japan wanted precise detail on how much the earth
moved. New York City police looked at emergency response.
   For all its havoc, last week's earthquake is now an
international case study for experts focusing on how and why the
earth convulses, what structures survive its tremors, and how to
save shaken lives.
   ``If there's any comfort for the people who lost loved ones, it
may be that all professionals learn from each one of these
disasters. It means we can do better the next time,'' said Ian
Buckle, deputy director of the National Center For Earthquake
Engineering Research in Buffalo, N.Y.
   ``In a sense, it is a laboratory. Teams from around the world
will come to learn from this,'' he said.
   Buckle was appointed by Gov. George Deukmejian to investigate
the collapse of the elevated, two-tiered section of Interstate 880
in Oakland, where people and vehicles were smashed between slabs of
concrete and steel.
   The freeway was built in 1957 before design load requirements
were tightened because of lessons learned in the 1971 San Fernando
earthquake, Buckle said. Existing roads and bridges were supposed
to be upgraded to conform to new codes.
   ``New bridges were not just designed for strength but ductility,
the ability to be pliable without collapsing. They well knew they
had not brought that highway up to code. Maybe this will accelerate
that program,'' Buckle said.
   I-880 was scheduled for improvements, but the state had deferred
the work was because officials thought the highway was structurally
sound.
   In their labs, engineers tinker with theories on computers on
how to make things strong enough to withstand jolts. Now they can
correlate their computer models against what happened in heavily
populated Northern California, just as they learned lessons from
quakes in Armenia, Mexico City and Tokyo.
   ``We can't simulate these forces in a lab. The forces are so
large,'' Buckle said. ``We don't get very many opportunities to
test theories or new design roles.''
   Not all lessons are technical. Police and fire departments from
New York City to Phoenix, Ariz., sent monitors to observe the
search and rescue work at I-880, where a burly dockworker was
plucked from the crumbled concrete four days after the Tuesday
temblor.
   ``In this business, we all try to learn from each other's
disasters, what were the pitfalls and what goes well,'' said
Oakland police Sgt. Alan Whitman.
   On Friday, five Soviet engineers walked through San Francisco's
Marina district, an upscale neighborhood where as many as 60
buildings crumbled or were damaged beyond repair.
   The Moscow experts sought to learn lessons they can use in the
rebuilding of Armenia, which was rocked earlier this year by an
earthquake of similar magnitude. The death toll there was 25,000,
blamed partly on shoddy construction of brick and mortar homes.
   ``Your city is much better than ours was because we had prepared
only for a 6.0 Richter scale earthquake,'' said Nathan Kotylar
through an interpretor. Both quakes registered 6.9.
   A nine-member delegation from Mexico came to learn about getting
ready for an earthquake because that country was underprepared for
the 1985 earthquake that ravaged Mexico City.
   ``They did not have a national system of disaster preparedness
or a civil emergency agency,'' said Paul Flores, director of the
Southern California Earthquake Preparedness Project.
   He said his office had also been contacted by several states
hoping to learn from California's experience, and he expected
delegations from Japan, New Zealand and Australia when things
settle down.
   ``This was a tragedy, but it would be even more of a tragedy if
we didn't learn what we could,'' Flores said.
   The greatest number of earthquake sleuths concentrated on the
epicenter on Loma Prieta Mountain in the Forest of Nisene Marks
State Park, 10 miles from Santa Cruz.
   Two plates of earth slipped 11 miles underground with enough
fury to move mountains, flatten freeways, buckle bridges, crumple
buildings and interrupt baseball's premier event, the World Series.
   Geologists and seismologists swarmed the mountain, searching for
cracks on the surface that would show where the San Andreas Fault
ruptured. Baffled scientists have been unable to locate the main
fissure.
   ``We should see surface displacement of as much as 3 to 4
feet,'' said Robert Streitz, a geologist with the California
Division of Mines and Geology.
   ``It's a jigsaw puzzle with 10,000 pieces,'' said geologist
David Schwartz.
   The quake triggered 90 instruments around the area that had been
preset to measure the speed of movement in buildings, structures
and the ground.
   A comprehensive analysis of those readings will take up to a
year, although Japanese experts have already asked California
officials for them via fax machines.
   Experts will also focus on schools and hospitals to see how they
survived. Undamaged structures will be studied for design features
that helped them get through.

   Volunteer lines were long and stacks of
information huge, but the victims were few Sunday at this city's
only FEMA disaster center. And the visits did not change the lives
of those who did show up.
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency opened seven one-stop
disaster relief centers Sunday, one each for the counties affected
by last week's earthquake.
   Volunteers helped people fill out applications for low-interest
loans, individual and family grants, temporary housing, counseling,
tax information, legal service referrals, Social Security,
veteran's benefits or hiring a contractor.
   The centers opened at 1 p.m. By 3:35 p.m., 126 people had
registered at this center set up in a gymnasium at the Presidio
army base, just blocks from the Marina district, one of the areas
hardest hit by the 6.9-magnitude quake that struck at 5:04 p.m.
Tuesday.
   By the end of the day, 565 applications for assistance had been
submitted to FEMA at all seven disaster centers, said FEMA
spokesman Phil Cogan. In addition, 6,241 applications had been
accepted over a special telephone hotline.
   Federal officials expressed disappointment at the Presidio
turnout. ``Typically we have the longest lines on the first day,''
said Mike Allan, a FEMA spokesman.
   Only 35 or 40 people were in line when the center opened, he
said.
   At the entrance to the gym, temporary FEMA employees waited to
help, but they outnumbered victims all afternoon.
   Barbara Nash and Jody Rosendin, both Red Cross volunteers, were
concerned about the low turnout.
   ``It's been a lot slower than we thought,'' Ms. Nash said.
``Most of the people want money right now and we can't give them
money.'' But doctors, psychologists and counselors were available,
she said.
   ``I just heard about some aid. I have nothing but these
clothes,'' said Neil Hancock, who lived in one of the Marina
apartment houses leveled by an earthquake-triggered fire.
   ``The apartment building was totally demolished. It burned down.
It's not even a pile of rubble. It's a hole,'' said Hancock, a
title insurance writer.
   He's been sleeping and eating at a Red Cross shelter, although
he moved in with a co-worker Sunday. He's spent his days
distributing supplies for the Red Cross. ``Just seeing everybody
else being so confused and upset, it's contagious and scary,'' he
said.
   Hancock did not leave the relief center with a new place to live
or any more clothes, but he took several forms he would fill out
for help later. Those included an application for temporary housing
that could shelter him for up to a month. But FEMA will take at
least 72 hours to process that application.
   Reg and Christine Miller were on their honeymoon in France when
the earthquake struck. They came home to find themselves homeless.
   ``We've got all our belongings sitting in an apartment we have
no access to,'' Miller said. They were allowed into their rented
apartment in the Marina district to gather clothing, but the
building is structurally damaged and considered unsafe.
   The Millers said inspectors hadn't decided yet if the building
could be repaired. But even if it can, the Millers say they are
unsure if they will return permanently.
   ``We always knew the Marina had problems because it is built on
a landfill. We saw fourth-floor apartments at the ground floor
level and the thought of people being trapped is pretty
upsetting,'' Miller said.
   The owner of a four-unit Marina apartment building came to the
center to find out what could be done about cracked sidewalks, an
open water main, structural cracks, plaster debris and other damage.
   ``The building hasn't been inspected yet, but the building next
to it had to be bulldozed,'' the landlord said. He declined to give
his name.
   Helping others has eased the shock and sense of loss for some
people, Hancock said. But there are so many little things that
people don't think about.
   He spent several hours at a bank Saturday proving who he was,
without identification papers, so he could access the modest
balance in his savings account. He waited in line at a post office
to file a change of address form so his mail would go to a
co-worker's home rather than a charred, vacant lot.
   ``I've walked 100 miles in the last couple of days. I see no
faces I recognize. Getting word about my neighbors has been almost
impossible. It's nuts. It's like nobody ever lived there. I feel
like I'm in Cincinnati.''

   Here is a county-by-county summary of death, injury and damage
reports from Tuesday's earthquake as gathered from the California
Office of Emergency Services, other agencies and reporter
observations:
   ALAMEDA COUNTY (Oakland and communities east of San Francisco
Bay) _ Mile-and-a-quarter-long section of upper deck of Interstate
880 in Oakland collapsed, with 38 bodies recovered from the freeway
wreckage so far. One man, 57-year-old Buck Helm of Weaverville, was
found alive in the wreckage Saturday and was in critical but stable
condition at a hospital Sunday.
   Up to 150 people were evacuated from a housing project Sunday
when severe cracks were found in another section of I-880 that
borders their apartments. The County Office of Emergency Services
says Oakland sustained 95 percent of the county's 349 injuries and
$1.5 billion-plus in damages. The OES reported 200 businesses,
including nine residential hotels, and 1,400 homes were damaged, at
least 10 buildings destroyed and 600 people displaced.
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Ten deaths, 566 injuries, 1,800 people
displaced, most in the devastated Marina district. Property losses
estimated at $2.5 billion.
   Sixty residential buildings were destroyed in the Marina. More
than 1,000 apartment buildings damaged, but no citywide figures
were available Sunday on the total number of buildings damaged.
About 2,000 Marina residences, including those damaged beyond
repair, remained without gas and electric service Sunday. The two
main state office buildings near the Civic Center are closed
indefinitely because of major structural damage.
   SAN MATEO COUNTY (borders San Francisco to south) _ No deaths,
282 injuries, damage estimated at $350 million. 600 homes damaged,

<HEAD>Happy Townspeople: Big Buck Helm Was ``Too Arrogant to Die''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HAL SPENCER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WEAVERVILLE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Friends of big Buck Helm, latest
legend in this misty mountain town, aren't surprised he survived
his entombment under a collapsed freeway. They say he's too tough
and too proud to die.
   ``Buck's a happy-go-lucky, generous guy, but let me tell you, I
wouldn't want him mad at me,'' said local inn owner Patsy Lawrence.
   ``He's just too arrogant to die,'' her husband, Bill, said with
a grin.
   ``Now we've got something to brag about besides the fact that we
live in the only county in the state without a single traffic
light,'' said Mrs. Lawrence. ``He's the legend of Weaverville. ...
This town will throw a big party when Buck gets back, you can bet
on it.''
   As Helm, 57, lay in a big city hospital bed after almost four
days in his car under Oakland's collapsed I-880, his feat was the
main topic in the neon-lit cafes and service stations crowding this
town's historic Gold Rush buildings.
   ``Out of all those people under there, he was the one to get out
alive. We're all just so happy,'' said Cathy Heald, another friend,
as she sat in Helm's favorite hangout, the Nugget Restaurant. ``I
just knew inside he was all right.''
   Helm's survival was a shock to Steven Whipple, an engineer with
the state Department of Transporation who was inspecting the
collapsed freeway when he saw a man wave at him through the window
of a crushed car.
   ``It stopped my heart,'' said Whipple. ``I thought maybe the
wind was blowing and that's what caused it. I thought I might be
losing it.''
   About five hours later Helm was carried out of the rubble as
exhausted workers cheered.
   In Weaverville, people are aware that Helm's condition remains
critical from the ordeal. ``We're praying for Buck in all our
Masses,'' said the Rev. John Lawrence, pastor at the Roman Catholic
church here. ``Everybody is so glad he's alive.''
   ``Buck isn't a churchgoer,'' said Peggy McConnell, a friend.
``But there is a spirituality about him and that's one of the
reasons he survived.''
   Across the street from the Weaverville Hotel, a small crowd
gathered to await the arrival of a newspaper vendor so they could
read front-page news about ``Old Buck.''
   ``Buck likes to tell a good story,'' said a laughing Jim
Nickerson, who waited with the others. ``He'll get to tell this at
least 3,500 times.''
   Nickerson was referring to the population of Weaverville, about
250 miles north of San Francisco in the Trinity Mountains. The town
depends on timber, sportsmen and tourists for its livelihood.
   Helm has lived here off and on since boyhood. He finally moved
his wife and children back for good several years ago.
   He and his wife, Lorene, have since divorced, but friends say
they remain close. Family members rushed to Oakland to be with
Helm, who spends the work week on the Oakland docks, sleeping in a
van, and weekends at home.

<HEAD>More Low-Rent Hotels Condemned, Forcing Poor Into Streets and Shelters</HEAD>

   A new wave of homeless hit the streets on
the weekend as safety inspectors condemned low-rent hotels damaged
by Northern California's devastating earthquake.
   Evacuees sought refuge in Red Cross shelters, friends' homes
and, when they could afford it, other hotels that may yet be
condemned.
   The number of hotel residents displaced could hit 900 by the
time all the city's buildings are inspected, officials said.
   The evacuations angered many residents, both because they had
been allowed to remain in unsafe buildings for so long and because
they were given only a few minutes to leave.
   ``Saturday evening, I came back here and saw all the commotion.
People were out on the sidewalk, pretty emotional,'' Richard
Haines, 52, said Sunday.
   He was standing outside the condemned Hotel Menlo, wondering
when he could return to his room in the eight-story brick building
to pick up the rest of his belongings.
   Haines, whose old apartment was damaged by the quake, moved into
the Menlo on Thursday, paying a nonrefundable $137 for the week.
   The building looked fairly sound: the exterior was missing a few
bricks and showed a few cracks, and the interior did not appear
seriously damaged, Haines said.
   But engineers decided Saturday that the building had sustained
structural damage. The building was condemned and residents were
told to leave.
   ``I got one box of clothes and my shaving gear,'' Haines said.
``That's all I could take. I tried to grab my TV, but they said to
leave it.''
   He moved to another hotel, but was afraid that it, too, might be
condemned, and his cash is running out. Haines hoped to borrow
money from co-workers when he returned to his job Monday so he
could buy lunch.
   Oakland emergency planner Jim Warland said some evacuations were
poorly executed, but that officials have changed procedures and now
provide bus transportation and more time for residents to gather
belongings.
   ``It's a very volatile situation,'' Warland said. ``They're
frustrated and they're frightened. They don't have many
possessions, and they're very protective of the possessions they do
have.''
   The Red Cross, already operating three shelters in Oakland and
Berkeley, opened another one Sunday to handle the swelling numbers
of evacuees. About 400 people used the shelters Saturday night.
   The Red Cross was working with the Federal Emergency Management
Agency to get people into more permanent housing. But that process
was frustratingly slow for people who had been cramped inside
shelters for days.
   ``When's this going to end?'' Victor Mendonca, 49, said Saturday
as he stood outside Oakland's Martin Luther King Jr. elementary
school, where 160 cots were lined up in the auditorium.
   Despite the wind-whipped rain, Mendonca said he had to escape
the crowded, stuffy shelter for a while.
   ``I don't want to be here,'' he said. ``I've got a job. All I
don't have is a pad.''
   During the quake, Mendonca ran from his apartment under a shower
of falling bricks. Saturday, he was allowed to salvage belongings
from his condemned home, only to find that looters had beaten him
to it.
   ``They took my television and ate my food,'' he said.
   Some shelter occupants said they had been promised more
permanent housing by Monday; others said they were told it could be
much longer.
   Many people are staying in their damaged homes, often without
electricity or gas, showing up at Red Cross feeding stations for
meals. Red Cross spokesman Paul Miller said stations in Oakland and
Berkeley were serving about 3,000 meals a day.
   Some 4,000 customers in the Oakland area were without gas, but
Pacific Gas &amp; Electric said it hoped to restore full service by
Monday.
   A preliminary assessment showed that the quake destroyed or
heavily damaged 120 houses, 250 apartment units, and 163 businesses
in the communities of Oakland, Berkeley, Albany, San Leandro and
Hayward, all on the east side of San Francisco Bay, Miller said.

   The deadly earthquake that shook thousands of square miles
around San Francisco last week left those who walked away with
stories to tell. Here are six personal recollections from the 1989
earthquake.

   We were just sitting down, trying to watch the game. Funny thing
is, I can't tell you what game I was starting to watch.
   The first instinct I've always had with earthquakes is to wait
for it to pass. I didn't want to wait for this one. We got out of
the house in a hot hurry.
   I talked to a few other Vietnam vets and they all thought they
were `in country' for a minute. It was like a shock akin to an
attack.
   For the next 45 minutes, we checked to see who had gotten hurt.
That store (Kathy's Place, a general store) is the whole community
thing right there and that's where everybody met.
   People worked together well, nobody asked questions, they just
did. I was running the generator; others were stocking the shelves.
People were looking for other people, trying to keep an even keel.
It was more like the way things were `in country.'
   The worst of it is, the aftershocks are not getting smaller,
they're getting larger. In Vietnam, you got to where you could
sleep in a certain state. You got to where your body can sleep, but
your mind's awake. I think that's what everyone is learning to do
now.

   I was in San Jose at a conference. By the time I got home, boy!
the phones were jammed. You couldn't get out. My phone wasn't
working at home.
   I hadn't realized how bad my husband was stressed out trying to
reach me. He was in Puerto Rico. I went to work the next day
because I knew we would have some major work to do with the agency.
Once I got to work I didn't even think of my own personal life.
   One of the good things, you get so busy you don't really think
about your own being.
   When I got home at about 11 that night. I was exhausted and went
to bed and didn't even try to call. He called me about 3 in the
morning and absolutly cried because he was so upset. I said I was
really sorry, because I knew I was OK. I just was so busy trying to
organize the workers here that I didn't even think that you would
be worried about me. So he was horrified.''

   I was waiting for the World Series to come on. I was sitting on
the bed, just kicked back. I was so relaxed and all of a sudden I
heard this (sound) _ it was like a bang. And I thought, `Oh,
another little earthquake. Cool.' ... But then, it felt like a
giant took (the building) and shook it. First I looked up and I saw
the ceiling, I mean the whole ceiling came down. I mean all of it,
at once. I said, ``Oh, no.''
   Then ... it shook so hard that the floor cracked. It more than
just cracked _ it's like it broke, snapped in half. That's when I
really got scared. I've been through earthquakes before, but not
like this one. ...
   I was running for the door, because it kept shaking and they say
get under a (doorway). I did that, but that didn't work. Everything
just rumbled, so I ran out of the building _ fast.
   Everything was falling ... the walls were cracking, everywhere.
One weird thing, though. Hardly any glass broke _ mostly the wood
and plaster, which maybe in one way was lucky.
   (I thought) ``Is this my last day on this Earth?''
   They say there's going to be one bigger than this one? Lord help
us all, really.

   I'll never forget where I bought my watchband.
   I was in Woolworth's at Market and Powell when the quake hit. I
just slammed my money down on the counter and ran. I said to
myself, `I don't want to die in Woolworth's.'
   When the building started shaking, at first I thought it might
be from the Muni trains underneath. For a second, I thought the
shaking was over, then there was a `boom' and it was like a giant
had picked the building up and slammed it to the ground.
   I almost knocked over a little old lady on the way to the
street. There was broken glass out there and a lot of dust flying.
   Then I went to my buildings to see if anyone was trapped in
elevators. ... I worked until 2 o'clock and they called me at 5:30
or 6 in the morning to come back in to work. We all got about three
or four hours' sleep those first two nights.

   I was taking a nap, actually. Christopher (her 4-year-old son)
was watching cartoons. I heard him scream _ that woke me up _ and
everything was really shaking.
   He ran into the bedroom. I grabbed him and lay down on top of
him. The first thing I thought was, `My God, this is it.' I heard
things crashing around, I looked out the bedroom door and saw my
refrigerator come out of the kitchen into the living room. When
everything stopped, I packed everyone a change of clothes and left.
I didn't know what else to do. ...
   (It was) like being in a tunnel underneath a freight train.
Christopher described it as `the planet was falling apart.' He
thought it was the whole world. He wanted me to call his
grandmother in Alabama and make sure they were OK.

   I had just walked outside (my girlfriend's home near the Forest
of Nisene Marks State Park, about 3 miles from the epicenter).
There was no reason. We talked about it later. We had just walked
outside.
   I immediately said I hope the center was underneath my feet,
otherwise there are going to be a lot of people dead.
   I immediately began to shake. I don't believe I've stopped yet.
It seems to me that the ground shakes every once in a while, but no
one else feels it.
   It seemed to me the ground went down 2 feet then immediately it
came back up and kind of rolled around. It was like the ocean going
through the ground. You could hear it coming, then you feel it,
then you hear it go up there.
   The worst part of the whole thing was not the earthquake _ it
was over suddenly and it was done. The aftershocks were a terror.
It's like, now it's happening again, but it doesn't happen.

   The private art collection of the late Campbell
Soup Co. chairman drew $131 million at auction _ the highest total
for a single owner's collection, Sotheby's said Saturday.
   The collection of John T. Dorrance Jr. was sold over four
sessions this week and included paintings by Pablo Picasso, Claude
Monet, Vincent Van Gogh and Paul Cezanne as well as garden statues,
French furniture and assorted porcelain, said Diana Brooks,
president of Sotheby's, North America.
   Brooks said the Dorrance collection ``possessed strong sense of
character which appealed to a wide spectrum of collectors.''
   At the first session Wednesday, ``Woman With a Red Umbrella,''
by Henri Matisse drew $12.4 million _ a record for the artist. That
first session itself eclipsed the previous record for a single
owner auction.
   The previous record for a single owner collection was set last
year when the collection of William Goetz, a Hollywood executive,
sold for $85 million.

   The family of earthquake survivor Buck
Helm was beginning to lose hope before he was dramatically pulled
from the wreckage of a crumpled highway, his ex-wife said Saturday.
   Lorene Helm broke down in tears and cut short a news conference
at Highland General Hospital as she described how the family
learned that Helm had survived.
   ``By (Saturday) our hopes were getting pretty dim, but we said
if anybody can make it Buck can make it,'' she said.
   Ms. Helm said she had been in contact with missing persons
officials Saturday morning, providing them with medical information.
   ``A few minutes later, the children heard there was a possible
survivor,'' she said. ``A few minutes after 12 ...'' and she broke
down in tears.
   A son, Marc, then offered ``special thanks to the workers who
found my father.''
   ``He's a great man,'' Marc said as he turned away from reporters
to end the session.
   Helm works and lives in Oakland, but spends weekends 250 miles
away in Weaverville visiting his children. Family members became
concerned immediately after Tuesday's earthquake, Ms. Helm said.
   ``My daughter contacted me at work and told me there was an
earthquake and she feared her dad might be in it,'' she said.
   They made repeated attempts to phone the area, but could not get
through.
   The next day, they called Helm's employer, the International
Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union, and found that he was not
at work and had not phoned in sick.
   ``Buck is the type of person who unless something is very wrong
he's always at work,'' Ms. Helm said. ``Since he had not called his
family, we knew something had to be seriously wrong.''

<HEAD>Report: Pentagon Rejects Ending Ban Against Homosexuals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon has rejected a draft report by a
military research center that concludes the armed forces should
reconsider their policy of barring homosexuals from the service,
The New York Times reported Sunday.
   A senior official said in an internal Pentagon memo that the
report was flawed, offensive and wasteful of government resources,
the newspaper said.
   In a statement Friday, the Pentagon said the report did not
respond to the original research request and has asked the author
of the study, Dr. Theodore R. Sarbin, to prepare another report
dealing soley with security questions.
   The unclassified report by the Defense Department's Personnel
Security Research and Education Center in California says the
Pentagon should reconsider its policy of barring homosexuals, a
conclusion Sarbin said would most likely be repeated in the new
report.
   Sarbin is a research psychologist and part-time consultant at
the center.
   The report and the Pentagon correspondence were made available
by members of Congress who believe the military should stop
discriminating against homosexuals and allow them to serve in the
armed forces.
   U.S. Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., criticized the Pentagon
for rejecting the report.
   ``The report was an excellent academic survey of available
literature. The problem is that the Defense Department doesn't want
to deal with it,'' Schroeder told the Times.
   The internal correspondence that criticized the document said
the report went far beyond its job of determining security risks
posed by homosexuals in the military while it examined the general
question of whether they were suited for the military.
   The report, which was completed 10 months ago, dealt only
briefly with the issue of security.
   The Pentagon has said that people who engage in homosexual
behavior undermine ``discipline, good order and morale.'' In 1982,
that policy was expanded to include men and women who have a
``propensity'' to homosexual behavior.
   The report said the government would probably be forced by court
rulings to reconsider its court rulings.
   The internal Pentagon correspondence was written by Craig
Alderman Jr., deputy under secretary of Defense for Policy. He said
the center responsible for the report had no authority to conduct
research on whether homosexuals were suitable for military service.
   He also said the Pentagon found the report ``to be technically
flawed, to contain subject matter (Judeo-Christian precepts) which
has no place in a Department of Defense publication, (and) to
reflect significant omissions with respect to relevant court
decisions concerning personnel security.''

   NASA told Atlantis' astronauts
Sunday to come home three hours early on Monday to avoid high winds
at the California landing site.
   Flight controllers had been working on a plan to land one orbit
early but decided after looking at the forecast to shorten the
flight by two orbits because of high winds expected in the
afternoon. Each orbit takes 90 minutes.
   The new landing time at Edwards Air Force Base in the Mojave
Desert is 9:33 a.m. PDT.
   To prepare for the return, commander Don Williams and pilot Mike
McCulley tested Atlantis' flight control systems and reported them
in good condition.
   The astronauts were awakened Sunday with the John Fogarty song
``Center Field'' _ the second wakeup call of the night.
   Earlier, an alarm sounded, signaling a high temperature reading
on an auxiliary power unit heater. A crew member solved the problem
by adjusting a sticky thermostat and shifting the position of the
shuttle so the section of the vehicle housing the unit was not in
the sun.
   Later Sunday, the five crew members planned to hold a news
conference in space, answering questions from reporters at the
Johnson Space Center in Houston.
   The Galileo probe they dispatched Wednesday continued to perform
well as it sped along more than 800,000 miles from Earth on a
2.4-billion-mile, six-year trip to Jupiter, NASA said.

   With a chorus of ``America the
Beautiful,'' the Japanese paid a warm tribute to former President
Ronald Reagan and his wife Nancy at a gala benefit concert Sunday.
   The concert, organized to benefit the Ronald Reagan Presidential
Library, began and ended with the patriotic song and featured Perry
Como, Placido Domingo, the Harlem Boys Choir and Japanese stars
Yuzo Kayama and Toshihiko Tahara.
   ``You'll never know, Ron, how much we need you. Please come here
with Nancy to stay,'' went the final tribute, set to the tune of
``You Are My Sunshine.''
   The concert was organized by the Fujisankei Communications
Group, which is sponsoring the Reagans' visit at a cost of $7
million. Reagan and Fujisankei have refused to confirm reports he
is being paid $2 million for his appearances.
   The Reagans waved to the audience and performers and sang along
with them in a final chorus of ``America the Beautiful.''
   Scenes of events during Reagan's presidency were shown on huge
video screens near the stage, which was lit in pastel pink,
lavender and blue. The scenes were subtitled with phrases praising
Reagan for ``restoring public confidence in America'' and helping
to ``maintain peace throughout the world.''
   The audience of more than 10,000 paid $35 to $70 to attend the
event at Yokohama Arena, 18 miles south of Tokyo.
   ``I thank you for your interest in the presidential library...I
want to thank all of you,'' Reagan said in brief comments after the
concert. ``I'm at a loss for words.''
   Earlier, the Reagans toured a mountainside art museum in Hakone,
63 miles southwest of Tokyo, owned by Fujisankei.
   Reagan stopped along the way to shake hands with delighted
Japanese museum- goers but did not respond to reporters' questions
about his reported fee.
   Fujisankei, Japan's largest media group, owns the newspaper
Sankei Shimbun, the Fuji Telecasting Corp. and Nippon Hoso, Japan's
biggest commercial radio network, among dozens of other companies.
   Like its chairman, Nobutaka Shikanai, many of the company's
media outlets espouse conservatism and nationalism. At the time of
Emperor Hirohito's death and the controversy it spawned over his
role in World War II, the Fuji TV network generally carried few
critical views of Japan's imperial system.
   The network's low-brow programming contrasts sharply with the
company's impressive art collections, including its outdoor
sculpture garden in Hakone.
   On Monday, Reagan begins the two-day official portion of his
visit, during which he will meet with Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu,
Emperor Akihito and other Japanese leaders.
   Reagan will receive other tributes during his visit. The
Japanese government plans to award him the Grand Cordon of the
Supreme Order of the Chrysanthemum _ one of its highest honors _
for promoting friendship between the United States and Japan and
working to protect the free trade system during his eight years in
office.
   The only other U.S. president to receive the honor was Dwight
Eisenhower.
   The Reagans are scheduled to return to the United States Oct. 28.

<HEAD>Kuwait Shelves Plans to Buy Mirage 2000s</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A senior military commander was quoted Sunday as
saying that Kuwait has decided against buying French-made Mirage
2000 jet fighters because it has enough U.S. warplanes to meet its
needs.
   It was the first remark by a senior Kuwaiti official that the
government had decided against purchasing the French warplanes.
   Both the emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, and Defense
Minister Sheik Nawaf al-Ahmed al-Sabah said last month that Kuwait
had not yet decided whether to buy the sophisticated planes.
   Maj. Gen. Jaber Khaled al-Sabah, deputy chief of staff of the
armed forces, told the daily Al-Anbaa that a deal with the United
States for 40 F-18 warplanes is enough to fulfill Kuwait's needs
for the time being.
   ``Kuwait considers the F-18 warplane suitable for its air
force,'' he said. ``But this does not mean that other planes are
inferior to it. The Kuwaiti air force is not in need of more arms.''
   The $1.8 billion deal for the F-18s was concluded during a visit
to the United States last year by Crown Prince and Prime Minister
Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah. Delivery starts in 1994.

   A bus overturned on a road east of
Jakarta on Sunday, killing at least 25 people and injuring dozens
of others, police said.
   The bus was carrying 78 people from Purbolinggo in central Java
to Jakarta when it overturned 16 miles east of the capital, said a
police officer.
   The police officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, would
not give further details.
   The newspaper Suara Pembaruan said about 40 people were injured.
   The bus was being driven at high speed and had passed some other
vehicles before the accident, the newspaper quoted a passenger as
saying. The passenger said the bus went out of control and hit an
overpass support before it overturned.

   An official newspaper accused a well-known
Shanghai writer and dissident of ``polluting the thinking of
youth'' by taking part in the spring pro-democracy movement and
said he will be punished.
   The blistering commentary, which was published Friday and seen
in Beijing on Sunday, was the first public attack on 71-year-old
Wang Ruowang, a prolific essayist who was put under house arrest in
June.
   ``Wang is a writer in name, but his fame comes not from some
outstanding writing but from some people calling him a `democracy
fighter,''' the Shanghai-based newspaper Wen Hui Bao said in a
half-page commentary. ``He even attacked Comrade Deng Xiaoping,
calling him a `power behind the throne,' and saying that `the days
when 1.1 billion people will submit to a monarch are over.' ''
   An unknown number of students, professors, writers and other
intellectuals have been jailed since the army crushed the democracy
movement in June.
   Hong Kong papers since have reported Wang was taken into
custody, but efforts to telephone his home for confirmation were
unsuccessful.
   Wen Hui Bao did not say where Wang was but said: ``In the end he
will be punished according to the law,'' indicating he faces trial.
   Wang has been jailed both by the Nationalists, for supporting
the Communist revolution, and by the Communists, for criticizing
their failures. For years, the official media and publishers have
refused to print his works, but he found an outlet in Hong Kong
publications.
   Wang was one of three intellectuals expelled from the Communist
Party in 1987 after an earlier series of student protests. One of
the others was China's most famous dissident, Fang Lizhi.
   When government controls eased in 1988, Wang and other
intellectuals founded a journal, ``The New Enlightment,'' that
published daring, probing essays on subjects such as alienation in
a socialist society.
   He marched along with students in Shanghai during the spring
democracy movement.
   Wen Hui Bao quoted him as saying during the protests: ``The day
I have longed for has arrived. ... One thing is certain, once this
student movement has begun, it cannot be repressed.''
   ``For so many years Wang has used his tongue and poor pen to
oppose socialism and incite counterrevolution,'' Wen Hui Bao said.
``His falsehoods and heresies won the acclaim of some people and
the cheap applause of some immature youth. Now his set of tricks
has been exposed.''

   Wan Degui had just moved into a new house with
three rooms when the earth came alive beneath his small village.
   ``I only lived in it for 12 days,'' he matter-of-factedly told a
Western reporter touring the region. ``But when the quake hit, it
just collapsed.''
   Wan, like other peasants in Guiren Village in northern Shanxi
province, made few demands of the government after the worst quakes
the region has seen in more than a decade.
   ``If we can resolve it ourselves, we will. If not, we will rely
on what the government can do,'' Wan said, but added, ``what the
government cannot do we will have to do ourselves.''
   The first of six strong tremors hit Wednesday night, and the
others followed Thursday, leaving 29 people dead and 50,000
homeless.
   In a sympathy telegram sent Sunday to the quake-struck area in
Shanxi and Hebei provinces, about 135 miles west of Beijing, the
government called on residents to show a ``spirit of hard struggle
and self-reliance.''
   Wan's neighbor, Guan Xiaoping, was doing his best. As the sun
set Saturday, he was still sawing boards for the frame of a
makeshift shelter he hoped would get him and his family of three
through the winter.
   His house collapsed, as did 95 percent of the homes in his farm
village of about 2,400 people set on a dusty, barren plain. Five
people were crushed to death, and two were injured, Wan said.
   The homes were mainly one-story structures of packed clay with
some stones and bricks to help hold them together.
   Three days after the quakes, villagers set up housekeeping in
tents of straw and quilts. Their pigs and horses roamed the dirt
paths.
   ``I was inside the house watching television, when I heard a
loud sound, like thunder. When the ground started to shake, we
rushed outside,'' said Guan.
   ``After the third quake, most of the houses had collapsed,'' he
said. His cat was crushed to death. His wife, young son, dog and
another cat escaped.
   His house in ruins around him, Guan still offered guests a
traditional warm welcome, pulling out a red vinyl-padded folding
chair and a glass of hot water boiled over an outdoor stove.
   His family has been sleeping since the quake in a straw tent,
but soldiers who arrived in the village Friday were helping him
build a stronger, although still temporary shelter.
   ``Yesterday there were five soldiers, today there were eight,''
he said. Altogether, several hundred soldiers came to the village,
residents reported, bringing clothing, instant noodles, crackers
and bowls.
   No one complained about the slowness of reconstruction efforts
or the government's failure to immediately provide shelter for the
homeless, who have huddled around fires and under makeshift tents
during the near-freezing nights.
   ``Every family is living like this,'' Guan said. ``We have no
other choice.''
   ``My lips have blisters from the cold and my entire body is
uncomfortable,'' said Liu Rongxiang, a matronly woman who was
bundled in several sweaters and a quilted jacket. ``My only hope
now is to have a home, whether it's good or bad.''

   A security company has agreed to pay
$8.75 million to settle a lawsuit that claimed an industrial fire
was started by a bored night guard who passed the time by tossing
flaming paper balls at a trash can.
   The Wells Fargo guard acknowledged tossing the fireballs in 1985
but said he extinguished them before continuing his rounds. That
was just before flames destroyed Vital Industries' main plant,
which made video equipment for TV studios.
   Attorney Tony Cunningham confirmed Friday that the settlement
had been reached between his clients _ Vital and Firemen's Fund
Insurance Co. _ and Baker Industries, parent corporation of Wells
Fargo Guard Service.
   The 1986 suit alleged that Wells Fargo failed to check the
background of the newly employed guard, train him and supervise him.

   The Legislature's two-day special
session on abortion produced no laws but will probably end up the
most expensive such exercise in Florida history.
   A survey of agencies involved in the session determined that
spending totaled more than $473,000, with some reporting
outstanding bills that are likely to push the cost to more than
$500,000.
   Most special sessions cost about $40,000 per day, but past
sessions did not involve as much planning and security as the Oct.
10-11 one on abortion.
   More than 600 law enforcement officers stood guard while some
20,000 people demonstrated on both sides of the issue.
   Gov. Bob Martinez called the session to take advantage of a U.S.
Supreme Court ruling in July allowing more curbs on abortion.
Fourteen bills died in committees without reaching the floor of
either house.

   ``London Calling,'' by the swaggering rock group
the Clash, topped a list of the 100 greatest albums of the 1980s
picked by the editors of Rolling Stone.
   ``The 100 Greatest Albums of the '80s,'' selected by 10 editors
of the magazine, appears in the Nov. 16 issue.
   The Clash, a now defunct band whose lyrics featured aggressive
working-class politics that became the staple of the punk movement,
recorded ``London Calling'' in 1980.
   The rest of the top 10, in descending order, are: ``Purple
Rain,'' by Prince and the Revolution; ``The Joshua Tree,'' by the
Irish rock group U2; ``Remain in Light,'' by the Talking Heads;
``Graceland,'' by Paul Simon; ``Born in the U.S.A.'' by Bruce
Springsteen; ``Thriller,'' by Michael Jackson; ``Murmur,'' by
R.E.M.; ``Shoot Out the Lights,'' by Richard and Linda Thompson,
and ``Tracy Chapman,'' by folk singer Tracy Chapman.
   The surprise listing is the record by the Thompsons, whose album
didn't make the charts but was critically acclaimed when Hannibal
Records released it in 1982.
   Nostalgia was a big factor on the list. Forty-nine of the albums
were released from 1980 through 1983.
   And the five 1989 releases on the list are by artists who made
their claims to fame during an earlier time. They are: ``New
York,'' by Lou Reed, No. 19; ``Oh Mercy,'' by Bob Dylan, No. 44;
``Freedom,'' by Neil Young, No. 85; ``Steel Wheels,'' by the
Rolling Stones, No. 87, and ``Full Moon Fever,'' by Tom Petty, No.
92.

   It was enough to make a little girl cry.
   The hand-carved carousel at Quassy Amusement Park, a favorite of
Connecticut children since 1919, was auctioned off piece by piece
to high-rolling antiques dealers and collectors for a total of
$638,000.
   By Saturday afternoon, the four dozen wooden horses, zebras,
giraffes and other animals that had ridden together for decades
were being separated and taken to faraway places like New Jersey,
Alabama and Washington state.
   ``It chokes you up a lot more than you thought it would,'' said
George Frantzis, whose family has owned the amusement park for
three decades.
   The merry-go-round was built in 1902. Quassy bought it in 1919
and operated it until this summer. Experts say only about 70
hand-carved wooden carousels remain of the estimated 6,000 that
dotted the American landscape at the turn of the century.
   The Quassy carousel fell victim to a trend _ a bidding frenzy
among private art collectors that has caused the value of antique
carousels to skyrocket. The Frantzis family said it could no longer
afford to maintain or insure the carousel and decided to replace it
with one made of fiberglass.
   Bidding opened when Jimmy Filler, a scrap-iron dealer from
Birmingham, Ala., bid $20,000 on the prize of the carousel, a lion.
Seattle antiques dealer Sam Pemberton outbid Filler, offering
$60,000. He said he would restore the lion and sell it.
   ``We've never had a lion and we wanted to get one,'' Pemberton
said.
   One after another, the wooden animals were sold _ sea horses,
camels, reindeers, a tiger and a goat.
   A camel went for $25,000, a tiger for $45,000, a giraffe for
$27,500, and finally, the Wulitzer organ went for $21,500. Filler
ended up buying six animals.
   The Frantzis family had hoped a collector would purchase the
entire carousel and keep it intact, but no one came forward.
Schoolchildren in Old Saybrook even wrote to Donald Trump, asking
him to buy the merry-go-round.
   But Trump was not in the park when bidding on the individual
pieces was complete and auctioneer David Norton offered one last
chance to keep the colorful herd together. A bid of $766,000 _ 20
percent above the total of the separate bids _ would have saved the
carousel. No one raised a hand.
   ``The machine has been sold piecemeal!'' Norton shouted.

   The government banned her, the
anti-apartheid movement censured her and potential legal battles
cloud her future. But Winnie Mandela has survived and is reclaiming
her role as one of South Africa's most prominent and defiant
activists.
   Mrs. Mandela, wife of jailed African National Congress leader
Nelson Mandela, vanished from public view in February when leading
anti-apartheid groups repudiated her and accused her self-appointed
bodyguards of waging ``a reign of terror.''
   In recent weeks, however, Mrs. Mandela has emerged with
high-profile appearances at several opposition rallies. The
relentless speculation about her husband's release, expected within
several months, keeps her at the center of the political stage.
   ``She is blunt, rash, emotional and speaks from the heart _ that
is why people respond to her and why she is controversial,'' said
Fatima Meer, author of a best-selling biography of Nelson Mandela.
   ``Even during the crisis, Winnie had the support and loyalty of
many, many people,'' Mrs. Meer said in an interview. ``She will
remain highly visible and widely respected.''
   When six of Mandela's closest ANC colleagues were freed from
prison Oct. 15, Mrs. Mandela accommodated one of them, Wilton
Mkwayi, at her home in Soweto, the huge black township outside
Johannesburg.
   She appeared that day at a rally for the freed prisoners. She
prepared to sit alongside them at a news conference, but activists
who organized the meeting politely directed her to a seat behind
the ANC leaders.
   The releases are widely seen as a trial run for freeing Mandela,
71, the country's best known black leader and possibly the world's
most famous prisoner. His release is considered necessary before
black leaders _ even relatively conservative ones _ will negotiate
with the white-led government.
   Mandela lives in a suburban-style ranch house on a prison farm
outside Cape Town. In recent months he has met several times with
his wife, as well as with anti-apartheid leaders who denounced her.
   Mandela reportedly told his wife not to talk to the press. She
remained silent for several months but has begun to speak out again.
   ``I am of no significance to anybody as an individual,'' she
told Tribute Magazine. ``To attack me is to attack Mandela, to
attack the ANC.''
   There has been no formal public reconciliation between Mrs.
Mandela and the anti-apartheid movement, but the overt criticism of
her has stopped.
   One activist who requested anonymity said anti-apartheid groups
are attempting to resolve their disputes with Mrs. Mandela before
her husband is released, ``but several problems remain.'' He
refused to elaborate.
   Several anti-apartheid leaders, including some who earlier
denounced Mrs. Mandela for ``violating human rights in the name of
the struggle against apartheid,'' refused recently to speak about
her on the record.
   The ANC has expressed concern about some of her statements, and
spokesman Tom Sebina, based in Lusaka, Zambia, noted she has no
formal position in the organization. But he added that Mrs. Mandela
``remains an important part of the struggle.''
   Mrs. Mandela's provocative statements and courageous defiance of
government restrictions made her one of the most visible symbols of
black resistance. Her followers often referred to her as ``Mother
of the Nation.''
   She married Mandela in 1958, when she was a 24-year-old social
worker and he was a 40-year-old ANC leader. Four years later he was
arrested, and he has been imprisoned ever since.
   She was under police restrictions almost continuously from 1963
to 1986, was arrested numerous times and held in solitary
confinement for 17 months in 1969-70. The repeated police action
only inspired defiance in Mrs. Mandela, now 55 and the mother of
two grown daughters.
   She often appeared at funerals of slain activists, dressed in
flowing dresses of black, green and gold _ the colors of the
outlawed ANC _ to give fiery speeches and clenched-fist salutes.
   But her questionable political judgment, sometimes imperious
style and reluctance to consult with anti-apartheid groups led her
into repeated conflict with both the white authorities and the
black community.
   Long-simmering disputes boiled over early this year when Mrs.
Mandela's bodyguards, known as the Mandela United soccer club, were
accused of abducting four youths and beating one of them,
14-year-old Stompie Seipei, to death.
   Nine people associated with the club are in custody for the
boy's death. He allegedly was kidnapped by the soccer team in
December and beaten at Mrs. Mandela's home.
   Seipei's body was found in a field, and the other three youths
have given affidavits implicating members of Mandela United. The
group seldom played soccer, but often stayed at Mrs. Mandela's home
and accompanied her at public appearances. They were involved in
repeated confrontations with police, journalists and local street
gangs.
   The accused, in custody since February, have pleaded innocent.
No trial date has been set.
   Anti-apartheid groups said in February they were ``outraged at
Mrs. Mandela's complicity in the abductions and assault of
Stompie.''
   She has denied any wrongdoing. Police Maj. Gen. Jaap Joubert,
who headed the investigation, declined to comment when asked if she
might be charged.
   The death of Seipei was one of several controversies that have
dogged Mrs. Mandela since she unilaterally lifted her police
banning order in 1985.
   At a rally in 1986, she endorsed the ``necklace'' killings,
whereby militant activists torched gasoline-soaked tires placed
around necks of suspected government collaborators.
   The government then lifted the ban on quoting Mrs. Mandela in
the apparent belief she would do more harm to her reputation by
speaking out than by being silenced.
   In 1987, she was sharply criticized for building a mansion on a
hillside in Soweto, surrounded by tiny, overcrowded matchbox
houses. Mandela reportedly has told his wife not to move into the
house.
   The Mandelas' small rented home was burned in a July 1988 arson
attack by Soweto youths feuding with the soccer club. Community
leaders urged Mrs. Mandela to disband the team, but she ignored
their advice.

   State Trooper Scott Smith didn't hestitate
to jump a fence to reach a drowning baby kangaroo, but the idea of
mouth-to-snout resuscitation gave him a moment's pause.
   Nevertheless, the trooper said, he ``blew into the nose a couple
of quick breaths and that brought it right around.''
   The Ogden man was watching the kangaroos at Hogle Zoo with his
family earlier this month when a female kangaroo hopped over to a
pond for a drink and her 18-inch-tall baby _ called a joey _
followed.
   ``Something spooked the joey and it jumped and when it jumped,
it landed in the water,'' Smith said.
   Two black swans began flapping their wings, driving the joey
into deeper water.
   ``My wife started screaming at me, `Scott, it's drowning! It's
drowning!''' he said. So he jumped the fence and pulled the animal
to safety.
   Smith said he could feel the joey's rapid heartbeat slow and its
eyes became glassy. The mouth was clamped shut, so he puffed into
the nose.
   ``Some of it boils down to pride. I'm in this thing this far. I
can't let it die now,'' he said.
   Richard Andrews, a foreman at the zoo, said the joey was placed
back in its hutch on soft bedding under a heat lamp and was
recovering.

   And now for the weather: miserable this
winter.
   So says Clara Hoover, who bases her prediction on the coats of
wooley worms, persimmmon seeds and wind conditions on Sept. 21, 22
and 23.
   Hoover has been a weather observer for the State Police, a
Kokomo radio station, Indianapolis TV stations and the National
Weather Service for nearly 25 years.
   This year's wind foretells a wet November and December, she
said. January and February will be wet, then cold, with heavy snow
and ice storms to end out the months.
   March should begin with heavy snow and then turn rainy. Blizzard
conditions are ripe for mid-March and again in April, she said.

   MANILA, Philippines _ Police killed 14 fleeing convicts after a
prisoner stabbed a guard and helped other inmates break out of a
northern Philippines prison, authorities said Sunday.
   Nine inmates remained at large after the Saturday breakout at
the provincial jail in Cabanatuan, 55 miles north of Manila. Two
other inmates were recaptured, officials said.
   Capt. Rodolfo Matias, deputy police chief, said the incident
began after an inmate stabbed a guard with a pair of scissors,
stole his M-16 rifle and pistol and freed 24 other prisoners.
   The guard, Oscar Orcenas survived the attack, Matias said.
   Police and soldiers caught up with the escapees at a nearby
field, and Matias said police opened fire after the escapees began
shooting weapons they had taken from the jail armory.
   Matias said the inmate who instigated the escape, Angel Paras,
was among the 14 killed. He had been awaiting trial on robbery and
murder charges.
   Civilian and military authorities have long complained of lax
security and overcrowded conditions at the country's provincial
jails, many of which were constructed more than a half century ago.
   In August, inmates seized a group of Christians who were holding
prayer services at the city jail in Davao, 610 miles southeast of
Manila.
   Twenty-one people _ six hostages and all 15 would-be escapees _
were killed.

<HEAD>Appearance of Anti-Tank Weapons Changes Cambodian Battlefields</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sophisticated anti-tank weapons have
helped Cambodian guerrillas score unprecedented victories against
the Vietnam-backed government, according to Western diplomats and
senior resistance officials.
   ``This is the most important weapon we have ever received,''
said Gen Dien Del, deputy commander of the Khmer People's National
Liberation Front. ``We can now defend ourselves against tanks.''
   The Liberation Front and another guerrilla faction reportedly
have received several hundred armor-piercing, anti-tank rockets in
the past few months.
   The weapons were used in the recent offensive in northwestern
Cambodia, in which guerrillas seized several key towns and a number
of government military positions, according to Western diplomats
and guerrilla sources interviewed last week.
   The Liberation Front and a group loyal to Prince Norodom
Sihanouk are loosely allied with the Communist Khmer Rouge in a war
against Cambodia's Vietnam-supported government, which was
installed after Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978 and ousted
the Khmer Rouge from power.
   The newly acquired weapons are the West German 67mm Armbrust,
the 84mm Swedish Carl Gustav, and the 89mm French LRAC, say the
diplomats and resistance sources.
   Both the Armbrust and the Gustav came to the two non-Communist
factions through Singapore, while the French weapons provided only
to the Sihanouk group came as part of a larger package of weapons
from France earlier this year, according to the sources.
   France has denied shipping weapons to the resistance.
   ``We receive many weapons ... we don't know where they come from
or who pays for them. I don't know and I don't want to know,'' said
Dr. Abdul Gaffar, the Liberation Front's senior military analyst.
   Senior resistance sources, who requested anonymity, said they
strongly pressured the United States and key Asian supporters to
help them acquire the weapons. More recently the resistance argued
the weapons would be vital to an offensive planned to begin
immediately after last month's pullout of Vietnamese forces from
Cambodia.
   Supplied mostly by China, the guerrillas have previously been
limited to light weapons. Government forces are supplied by the
Soviet Union with tanks, heavy artillery and a small fleet of
fighter planes and assault helicopters.
   Guerrillas claim to have destroyed more than 10 tanks, armored
personnel carriers and heavy trucks in the first two weeks of
October, more than twice the number they knocked out in the
decade-long war.
   The anti-tank missiles were first deployed in the offensive that
began only four days after Vietnam said it withdrew its last troops
from Cambodia on Sept. 26.
   The resistance was unable to hold significant territory until
this month.
   ``This will do for us what the Stingers did for Afghanistan,''
Dien Del said.
   U.S. Stinger anti-aircraft missiles sent to the guerrillas in
Afganistan are widely believed to have turned the tide in favor of
the resistance several years ago.
   Bangkok-based diplomats say requests for weaponry and supplies
go through the Cambodian Working Group, composed of representatives
from the United States, Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia. The
Bangkok-based group reviews battle plans before approving weapons
requests.
   The United States pays the cost of some anti-tank weapons
training, reliable sources say.
   Washington denies providing lethal aid to the resistance but a
legal aid program exists that could include non-lethal military
assistance.
   On a recent tour by The Associated Press of territory captured
by the resistance, several Soviet tanks and heavy transport trucks
were seen destroyed near the key towns of Thmar Pouk, Banteay
Chmar, and Kandoul in the northwestern Cambodian province of
Battambang.
   ``It is absolutely essential that we continue to have anti-tank
weapons,'' Abdul Gaffar said. ``If we ran out of anti-tank weapons
tommorow, the day after tommorow the Phnom Penh tanks would roll
over our positions.''

<HEAD>Maine's Returnable Container Law Seen As Nation's Most Expansive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GLENN ADAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maine residents face changes in the way
they live, work and play as the state phases in the nation's most
far-reaching returnable-container law.
   By next September, refundable deposits will be required on every
non-dairy drink container up to a gallon in size _ from tiny jars
of baby juice to liquor bottles.
   All non-returnable containers, including single-serving ``juice
boxes,'' will be banned, as will the plastic ``yokes'' that hold
six-packs together.
   Environmentalists are delighted with the law, saying it sets a
standard for the nation that will reduce rubbish and litter, save
energy used in producing containers and promote conservation.
   ``Basically, they took a good thing and made it better,'' Pat
Franklin of the National Container Recycling Coalition in
Washington, said of Maine lawmakers. ``I really think Maine will be
leading the way on this.''
   Others, like grocer Hugh Holmes of Farmingdale, are unhappy.
Holmes said his market has already run out of space for storing
returned containers, and he may have to convert an office into a
used-can bin.
   ``It's absolutely scary,'' said Holmes.
   Maine's ``bottle law'' was approved by referendum in 1976.
Voters resoundingly reaffirmed their support and stopped an
industry-backed repeal campaign in 1979.
   The current law, similar to those in force in fewer than a dozen
other states, bans non-returnable containers for beer and soda and
requires consumers to pay a deposit for each can or bottle. The
deposit is refunded when the consumer turns in the container.
   Under legislation enacted this year, that will be expanded in
steps:
   _As of Jan. 1, anyone who brings more than 48 ``no deposit''
cans or bottles into the state will face fines of $20 per
container. Also on that date, Maine joins a handful of states that
charge deposits for liquor bottles _ 15 cents each.
   _On Sept. 1, all throwaway, non-dairy beverage containers will
be banned.
   _On July 1, 1991, plastic six-pack ``yokes,'' which do not
decompose readily and have been known to entangle and kill birds
and other animals, will be banned.
   National Soft Drink Association legislative analyst Virginia
McCoy said the ban is the only one of its kind in the nation.
   Although the legislation was the product of extended
negotiations among diverse interests, some industry officials have
vowed to step up efforts to weaken the law before the changes take
effect. They maintain that aggressive but voluntary recycling is
preferable.
   Gerber Products Co.'s Rick Jarman said his company will ask the
Legislature to exempt baby juice jars. He warned that the added
costs of special labeling required by the law would be passed onto
consumers.
   Targeted for special opposition by industry is the ban on
``aseptic'' containers, or juice boxes, which environmentalists say
are not recyclable because they contain mixed layers of plastic,
paper and aluminum.
   ``It's an entirely different thing to say `we're going to mess
with your business' than to say `we're going to terminate your
business,''' said Linda Smith Dyer, a lobbyist for Tetra Pak Inc.,
a Connecticut company that calls its product ``environmentally
friendly.''
   Dyer said her company may have an ally in consumers, who find
the containers handy to pack in lunch pails and backpacks.
   Polls show strong popular support, said state Sen. Judy C. Kany,
co-chairwoman of the legislative committee that refined the measure.
   ``My phone has been ringing off the hook'' with offers of help
to keep the law alive, said Sharon Treat, lobbyist for the Natural
Resources Council of Maine.

<HEAD>Treasury Secretary's Political Stock Rises After Stock Market Fall</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the aftermath of the Friday the 13th stock
market dive, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady's political stock
has risen for successfully avoiding the pitfalls that ensnared the
Reagan administration two years ago.
   Before the crisis, the low-key Brady tended to pale in
comparisons with his predecessor, James A. Baker III, now secretary
of state.
   But in spearheading the government effort to prevent the Crash
of '87 from repeating itself, Brady is winning praise for deft
handling of the situation.
   ``It was clear that the government stood prepared to help
prevent a repeat of that 508-point debacle,'' said Allen Sinai,
chief economist of the Boston Co. ``The policymakers all said the
right things and helped to contain any problems.''
   When the market dropped 108 points on a Friday two years ago, it
followed with a 508-point plunge the next Monday. This time,
Friday's 190-point decline was largely offset by an 88-point rise
the next Monday.
   That success notwithstanding, Brady hinted in an interview
Friday that he may soon recommend several steps aimed at promoting
more coordination among regulators. He would not be specific about
what changes were being considered.
   In a free enterprise system, government policymakers are not
necessarily concerned with imposing rules that inhibit the normal
ebb and flow of market forces. But they are concerned when other
factors _ particularly those unique to the high-speed, computer
driven trading of the modern era _ threaten to undermine or
overwhelm the more natural forces.
   In addition to directing the fact-finding operation that insured
a supply of accurate information upon which to base decisions
during the market plunge earlier this month, Brady worked to have
government policymakers from the president on down speak with one
voice to project an air of calm.
   This time, there was no verbal gaffe to worry markets, such as
then-SEC Chairman David Ruder's comment to reporters two years ago
that trading might be halted, a remark widely believed to have led
to further panic selling.
   Other key roles were played this year by Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan, who also navigated the shoals of the '87
crash, Gerald Corrigan, head of the New York Federal Reserve Bank,
and Richard Breeden, the new chairman of the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
   But Brady, who took the lead in the crisis-management effort,
and his top aides at the Treasury Department are coming in for much
of the congratulations for avoiding a repeat of Black Monday.
   Reviewing events during the interview in his office, Brady
played down his own role, saying policymakers were better prepared
this time around and armed with more sophisticated means of
monitoring market developments.
   Brady was on hand Monday morning watching the flashing signals
that tracked developments in the stock markets, stock futures,
international currency and bond trading not only in the United
States but in markets around the world.
   For Brady, market monitoring was nothing new. He spent 35 years
on Wall Street as an investment banker. He also headed the Brady
Commission, the panel which issued the first and, many believe, the
best review of the causes of the record 508-point market plunge on
Oct. 19, 1987.
   In addition, the two Harvard professors who directed the Brady
commission investigation are now working as top aides to Brady at
the Treasury Department.
   Known as the ``gold dust twins,'' Robert Glauber, Treasury
undersecretary for finance, and David W. Mullins, Treasury
assistant secretary for domestic finance, are considered experts on
the operations of financial markets.
   When the market began tumbling late in the afternoon on Oct. 13,
Brady turned to these two aides to launch a fact-finding operation
that continued throughout the weekend.
   In 1987, when the stock market fell 108 points on the Friday
before Black Monday, the response was far different. At that time,
Baker was in a highly publicized feud with West Germany over
international economic coordination.
   Baker's pointed criticism of interest rate increases in West
Germany, which he continued through that weekend, unnerved
investors and were considered extremely ill-timed given the
volatility in the markets.
   This time, Brady and others in the administration went out of
their way to emphasize that U.S. officials were in close
consultation and coordination with major U.S. allies.
   The Federal Reserve did its part by letting it be known that it
stood ready to inject large doses of cash into the banking system
as a way of assuring jittery markets that cash-short brokerage
houses would not have to sell off more stock because they could not
get bank loans.
   The Fed under Greenspan performed the same function in 1987 but
only after the huge Monday sell-off had occurred. By getting word
of its intentions out over the weekend, the Fed helped remove a
major area of uncertainty.
   Behind the scenes, Treasury's fact-finding operation was turning
up some encouraging signs that 1989 would not be a repeat of 1987.
   For one thing, there were technical signs in the trading data
suggesting that computer trading programs that had been harmful in
1987 would not be a factor this time.
   In another turnaround from 1987, checks with 24-hour mutual fund
hotlines indicated no rush on the part of investors to sell their
holdings.
   Armed with this information, Brady convened a meeting in his
office late Sunday with Greenspan, Breeden and various aides to
review plans for the Monday morning market opening.
   In an effort to avoid any sense of panic, Greenspan kept a
scheduled speech Monday morning before the American Bankers
Association while Brady attended the regular 7 a.m. White House
staff meeting to counsel calm.
   His message: ``You shouldn't look at this loss on Friday as some
cataclysmic event but more (as) an instantaneous technical
reaction'' to a market that was somewhat overvalued.
   ``I don't think anybody had an air of panic,'' Brady says in
assessing the mood as the markets opened Monday.

   From a distance, it is a stark, desolate
array of odd, gray columns. Up close, it is an eerie display of
automobile history.
   Art or junk, this creation of old vehicles called Carhenge
attracts hundreds of people to the Sandhills of northwestern
Nebraska, where residents are debating whether the monument _ or
automobile graveyard _ should be preserved.
   James Reinders, a Houston oil consultant, created Carhenge in
1987 as a takeoff on the ancient religious and astronomical site
Stonehenge on Salisbury Plain in England. Instead of colossal
stones, he used cars.
   He arranged 22 aging Plymouths, Fords, Chevrolets _ even an
ambulance _ in a wheat field two miles north of Alliance. Sixteen
cars are planted trunk down with their front ends in the air. Six
more sit atop them, forming arches.
   In Alliance, a community of 9,900, city officials are debating
whether to enforce a permit that requires Reinders to pave the
entry to Carhenge by July 15, 1990, or see it torn down.
   A group called Friends of Carhenge, headed by City Councilman
Paul Phaneuf, incorporated last week and wants to raise the $2,000
for the paving.
   Reinders says he already pays for liability on his property and
is not interested in paying for paving.
   ``This is really good for Alliance and it didn't cost anybody
anything,'' said Phaneuf. ``Finally, someone has given us something
of value.''
   ``It's wonderful for us,'' said Martin Marnett, manager of a
local fast-food restaurant. ``It has created so much interest ...
and it does put a grin on your face.''
   On Nov. 2, the council will vote on a request to change the
zoning of the land from agricultural to commercial, eliminating the
need for paving.
   Janet Steele, executive director of the Alliance Chamber of
Commerce, said Carhenge detractors were vocal until a comment box
was installed at the site in August. It drew 425 responses in the
first 20 days, most of them overwhelmingly favorable.
   Critics argue the car pile should be torn down because it is
unsightly. Some say it is nothing more than a junkyard.
   Besides Carhenge and the annual Heritage Days in July, there
isn't much to bring people to Alliance.
   Highway 2 runs east through town into the scenic Sandhills, but
for out-of-state folks, the closest wonder is Mount Rushmore three
hours away in South Dakota.

<HEAD>Moslem Clothing Covers France With Controversy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The decision by three North African girls to wear
Moslem head coverings to junior high school has exploded into an
intense national debate over religion in public schools.
   At issue is the secularity of education enshrined in French law
since the official separation of the church and the state in this
largely Roman Catholic country in 1905.
   Some argue that wearing the ``hijab,'' a scarf that covers the
hair, ears and neck, is tantamount to proselytism.
   About 400 people shouting ``God is great!'' in Arabic
demonstrated in Paris on Sunday to support the teen-agers. Women
wearing Moslem scarves carried banners that said: ``The hijab is
our honor.''
   The demonstration was called by the Islamic Association of
France and the Voice of Islam, which organized demonstrations a few
months ago against the Salman Rushdie novel ``The Satanic Verses.''
The two groups, however, represent only a minority of Moslems in
France.
   The controversy over the scarves began in October at Creil, 40
miles north of Paris, when Leila Achahoun, 15, her sister Fatima,
14, and their friend Samira, 14, all of Tunisian origin, were told
by the principal they could not wear the hijab to school.
   The girls demurred. The debate grew. Negotiations started.
Similar cases sprang up in Marseille, Avignon and Montpellier. A
compromise was reached at Creil _ the girls were allowed to wear
hijabs to school, but not in class. Again they demurred.
   Religious leaders _ Moslem, Jewish and Christian _ seemed to see
little harm in the wearing of the hijab. But school and union
leaders came down soundly on the side of keeping all signs of
religion out of schools, saying secularity is one of the pillars of
French democracy. Political leaders waffled.
   Alain Goldmann, the grand rabbi of Paris, reasoned that it would
not harm other children to be aware of the differences between
people. ``They learn to know and respect others,'' he said.
   Bernard Antony of the extreme right National Front said wearing
the hijab was ``the beginning of the Lebanonization of France
because it is obvious that if we continue to allow hundreds of
thousands of Moslems to enter France, we cannot indefinitely
deprive them of their customs, their rites, and when they become
the majority, they will not hesitate to apply the charia (Islamic
law).''
   Islam is the second-largest religion in France, with 2.5 million
adherents.
   Ernest Chenieres, principal of the Gabriel Havez junior high
school in Creil, says he is only doing his job applying French
regulations regarding religion in schools.
   The scarf clearly is ``a proselytic declaration'' by the three
girls, he said. ``Imagine if it was not just three young girls, but
1,000 or 50,000.''
   In Montpellier, 14-year-old Loubma Ryad, who had been wearing
her scarf to school more than two years, suddenly was asked to
stop. Her parents withdrew her from school.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency criticized the
French for invoking an old law against Moslems ``while wearing of
crosses by Christian students, and the special hats by Jews or
their absence from classrooms on Saturdays, has not caused any
problems for the secular schools in France.''
   Danielle Mitterrand, wife of President Francois Mitterrand,
said: ``If 200 years after the Revolution, secularity is not able
to welcome all religions, all the (religious) expressions in
France, it would be a step backward. If the veil is the expression
of religion, we must accept traditions, whatever they may be.''
   But Khorsi Sadok, vice president of the Association of French of
Algerian Origin, said Mrs. Mitterrand had missed the point and was
``adding her support to a fundamentalist operation aimed at
stopping the emancipation of Moslem women.''
   Yannick Simbron, secretary-general of the National Education
Federation, the country's largest teachers' union, said the right
to education must take precedence over religious customs.
   Sheik Tedjini Haddam, who as rector of the Grand Mosque of Paris
is considered the top Moslem authority in France, said he was
``indignant'' at the attitude of school officials.
   ``If a young girl asks that her hair be covered, I think that it
is her most elementary right,'' he said, adding that not only was
the hijab not a religious statement, it was perhaps a reaction to
certain modern clothes that were indecent.
   Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger, the archbishop of Paris, warned
against confusing ``the problems of Islam with those of
adolescence,'' comparing it to the wearing of dreadlocks, long thin
braids worn originally by Rastafarians.

<HEAD>Venerable Phillips Collection Doubles Gallery Space</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The master paintings and sculptures of the
Phillips Collection, the oldest museum of modern art in America,
are luxuriating in bright new gallery spaces after a $7.8 million
expansion financed largely by a wealthy Japanese businessman.
   The new Goh Annex, which opened in late September after two
years of construction, more than doubles the private museum's
exhibition _ to more than 30,000 square feet _ and ushers the
Phillips into the next century with state-of-the art features
comparable to the finest public museums.
   New storage and picture-handling facilities, climate control
equipment, a conservation laboratory and education classrooms made
possible by the latest expansion, the sixth since Pittsburgh steel
and banking heir Duncan Phillips founded the museum in 1921 in his
red-brick mansion near Dupont Circle.
   When Phillips opened three rooms of his home as a public
gallery, his collection consisted of 237 paintings. Today, the
museum houses about 2,500 works of art, many of them acquired and
donated by Phillips and his artist wife, Marjorie.
   The cornerstone of the museum's collection is Pierre Auguste
Renoir's ``The Luncheon of the Boating Party,'' the Impressionist
masterpiece which Phillips bought in 1923 for $125,000. Other
notable holdings include El Greco's ``The Repentant Peter,'' Paul
Cezanne's ``Self Portrait,'' Edgar Degas' ``Dancers at the Bar''
and Paul Gauguin's ``Still Life With Ham.''
   The old masters form the backdrop for the works of modern
artists that Phillips sought to support and encourage, from Pierre
Bonnard to such American modernists as Georgia O'Keeffe, John Marin
and Arthur Dove.
   The art collection grew so rapidly that it literally forced the
Phillips out of their neo-Georgian mansion in 1930, and they moved
to another home. In 1960, a three-story annex with sculpture garden
was built next door.
   The new Goh Annex expanded the 1960 building outward and added a
fourth floor. The latest addition was named for Yasuhiro Goh, a
Japanese art patron and pioneer of ocean transportation of liquid
gases who donated $1.5 million to the Phillips last year.
   Goh first toured the Phillips during a visit to Washington in
1951. He wrote later that ``the museum has stayed fixed in my mind
since that time as an expression of individual endeavor and
initiative.'' He said his grant was a gesture of gratitude to the
United States, where he and his three children were educated.
   Funds for the Goh Annex came mostly from individuals,
corporations and foundations, the same private sources that provide
the bulk of the museum's annual $3 million operating budget. The
Phillips also raised $1 million for the expansion project by
sending 85 of its master paintings on a 1987 tour of Europe and
Australia.
   Besides proceeds from a $3 million endowment established by
Duncan Phillips before his death in 1966, the museum also receives
an occasional federal grant from the National Endowment for the
Arts to underwrite some of the four to six special exhibitions it
mounts annually.
   Laughlin Phillips, son of the founder and former publisher of
Washingtonian magazine, succeeded his father as the museum's
director.
   Over the years, the Phillips has become a beloved institution to
a loyal and steadily growing audience of art lovers who enjoy the
quiet, unhurried ambience of the mansion's stately halls, as if
they are welcome guests free to linger over a favorite painting as
long as they wish.
   By 1986, before construction began on the Goh Annex, the number
of annual visitors had reached 156,000.
   A popular Phillips tradition since the 1940s has been the Sunday
afternoon series of free recitals by promising young professional
musicians, held in a long hall that was added to the mansion in
1907.
   Among the musicians whose early careers included performances in
the Phillips ``music room'' were opera singer Jessye Norman and
pianists Emanuel Ax and Glenn Gould.

<TEXT>
   Rockets slammed Sunday into a
government military base used to launch missiles at guerrilla
positions, witnesses said. Stray rockets reportedly killed at least
four people living nearby.
   An additional 15 rockets pelted the city, leaving five people
hurt, the government said.
   Witnesses in the northwest corner of Kabul said more than a
dozen rockets landed in the Kargha military base Sunday morning.
   One man who lives across the street from the base said the
rockets kicked up large clouds of dust inside the base. He said he
herd sirens within the gates of the base.
   The government denied the base was hit.
   Throughout the morning, a series of Soviet-made missiles were
shot from the base at what are believed to be rebel strongholds in
the Paghman Mountains outside of Kabul. Every 30 seconds, a large
boom echoed outside the base as another missile blasted off.
   Near the base, witnesses said one woman was killed when a rocket
crashed into into her mud house. A child was injured when a rocket
plowed through a mud wall and sprayed shrapnel around a courtyard
where he was playing, the witnesses said.
   A couple were killed as they were walking with their cow when a
rocket crashed into into a nearby elementary school and exploded,
according to the witnesses. Sunday is usually a school day in
Afghanistan, but elementary school has been canceled in Kabul
because of the war and a fuel shortage.
   On Saturday, a rocket ripped through the roof of a dining hall
at a textile factory, leaving five dead. Another 13 missiles struck
the city, killing an additional seven people.
   In the past 30 days, 47 rockets have hit Kabul, leaving 66 dead
and more than 100 wounded, government spokesman Mohammed Nabi Amani
announced Sunday. Since June, when the rocket attacks gained
frequency, close to 400 people have died and about 900 have been
injured in the attacks.
   The government blames the U.S.-backed rebels, who have been
fighting 11 years to set up an Islamic state in Afghanistan. The
guerrillas claim the Soviet-backed government rockets its own
people so it can blame the guerrillas.

<HEAD>Man: Finding Survivor ``Stopped My Heart''</HEAD>

<DATELINE>OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Steven Whipple thought he might be
hallucinating when he saw a man wave at him through the window of a
crushed car trapped in the rubble of a collapsed double-deck
freeway.
   ``It stopped my heart,'' Whipple, a California Department of
Transportation engineer, said Sunday. ``I thought maybe the wind
was blowing and that's what caused it. I thought I might be losing
it,''
   He looked again, and this time he thought he saw the man's head
move in an effort to turn around.
   Whipple immediately called co-workers on a radio to report that
he might have found someone alive.
   About five hours later on Saturday, 57-year-old Buck Helm was
carried out of the rubble as exhausted workers cheered and renewed
efforts to find more survivors of Tuesday's earthquake.
   Helm, listed in critical condition at Highland General Hospital,
was the first person found alive in the collapse of the I-880
freeway since the first night. More than three-dozen bodies have
been removed.
   Whipple, who is 29 and lives in Pittsburg, Calif., normally
spends his time inspecting highway structures that are about to be
worked on by contractors. But like other Transportation Department
employees, he has done a variety of jobs since the disaster.
   Saturday he was inspecting a portion of the Nimitz where workers
planned to remove crushed cars later in the day. He was checking
the structure for stability, but what he saw made him question his
own stability.
   As he told a news conference Sunday, he was working in tomb-like
silence by the light of a flashlight in narrow spaces, with a clear
view of Helm's car 30 to 40 feet away.
   That's when he thought he saw a hand come up and wave through a
side window, Whipple said.
   ``He waved at me. It surprised me,'' he said.
   Unsure of what he had seen, he looked again, and the second
movement convinced him there finally was a survivor of the Nimitz
disaster.
   ``I was a bit shaky when I started calling on the radio to let
the other guys know we had a live person in here'' and shook for 20
minutes afterward, he said.
   Whipple stayed on the scene as rescue workers dug Helm out. He
said he has not tried to contact the injured man, because he does
not want to interfere with his medical care.

   After fleeing South Carolina with
Hurricane Hugo gusting at his heels, the last thing Darrel Dixon
expected was to be caught in the middle of one of the nation's
worst earthquake disasters.
   But as the Utah businessman walked through San Francisco's
Chinatown shortly after 5 p.m. Tuesday, the sidewalk began to rock
under his feet.
   ``It was really scary,'' he recalled Sunday. ``A lot of people
were running outside. I looked up at the buildings around me
wondering if they would come down, and I ran into the middle of the
street.''
   Dixon, who travels around the country selling wastewater
treatment equipment, said the coincidence of confronting two of the
biggest natural disasters in U.S. history was ``a little spooky.''
His wife, Melva, agrees.
   ``Once in a lifetime, maybe,'' she said. ``But not twice,
especially in a three-week period.''
   Dixon is a group product manager for Salt Lake City-based EIMCO,
an equipment manufacturer once known as Eastern Iron Metal Company.
He was in San Francisco to pitch his company's products at the
Water Pollution Control Federation Conference.
   Just a few weeks before, on Sept. 21, Dixon was conducting
seminars for engineers and consultants on Kiawah Island, just south
of Charleston, when authorities ordered the resort community
evacuated.
   ``The next morning, the winds were starting to blow. We went
ahead and got off the island,'' Dixon remembered. ``The airport
closed, so we drove a rental car down to Atlanta and flew out of
there. Hugo hit that night.
   ``I got back into Salt Lake City in time to watch the news
accounts of it hitting Charleston,'' he said, adding he felt both
relieved, and a bit guilty, about having made it out in time.
   ``You kind of feel like you're leaving these people behind,'' he
said.
   There was no escape from witnessing disaster last Tuesday,
however.
   After the shaking stopped, Dixon hurried back to his downtown
hotel. With electricity out, he climbed the stairs, in gathering
darkness, to his seventh-floor room. It was while he was in the
shower that an aftershock hit.
   ``It kind of knocked me around a bit. The main thing I could
think of was I wanted to hurry up and get out of there because if
the hotel came down, I wanted to have some clothes on,'' Dixon said.
   The next morning, on a trip that took nearly five hours to cross
the Golden Gate Bridge alone, Dixon and associates drove a rented
car to Sacramento to catch flights home.
   Friends have joked with him that he should stay home from now
on. But Dixon and his wife plan to go to Hawaii for their 22nd
wedding anniversary next March.
   ``People have warned me that if I do, a volcano will probably
erupt while I'm there,'' Dixon said.

   The NAACP is launching a drive to increase the

populations.
   The program in St. Louis, Detroit, New York, Baltimore and
Memphis, Tenn., was announced Saturday at the annual fall
conference here of the board of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People.
   ``Afflicted with the highest incidence of high blood pressure
and kidney failure of any racial group, blacks have a
disproportionately high need for kidney transplants. Therefore,
blacks must learn to help themselves by increasing the pool of
potential donors,'' said executive director Benjamin L. Hooks.
   The program will be coordinated by the NAACP and Dow Chemical Co.
   Dow is providing brochures, donor cards and videotapes to NAACP
branches and offering advice on running donor awareness campaigns.

<HEAD>Boston Doctor Named Chairman of Planned Parenthood</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Boston doctor who once was tried on a
manslaughter charge for performing an abortion has been named board
chairman of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America.
   Dr. Kenneth C. Edelin, 50, who stepped down in June as chairman
of obstetrics and gynecology at Boston City Hospital to enter
private practice, was named to the three-year, unpaid term at the
federation's 66th annual meeting, which concluded Sunday in San
Diego.
   ``I expect to be very visible,'' Edelin told the Boston Sunday
Globe. ``And I especially hope to increase minority participation
in Planned Parenthood and build links to the civil rights
community.''
   Edelin was a young resident at the hospital when he performed a
second-trimester abortion in 1973 after the U.S. Supreme Court
issued the Roe vs. Wade decision that made abortion legal.
   The City Council ordered an investigation that led to charges
against Edelin. He was convicted, but the Massachusetts Supreme
Court threw out the verdict.
   Edelin said he believes Planned Parenthood has a vital role to
play in the political climate over abortion.
   ``The point of my prosecution then was to intimidate
physicians,'' he said. ``Today, they're trying to intimidate women
going into clinics.''

<TEXT>
   In a crowded East Berlin subway train, commuters
shake their heads in disbelief as they flip through the Communist
Party newspaper Neues Deutschland, its pages brimming with workers'
complaints and admissions of official bungling.
   In an apartment not far from the Berlin Wall, an East Berlin
family switches off a variety show on West German television to
tune in to the state-controlled nightly newscast.
   ``We haven't watched it for years, but we make sure we do now,''
said Ulrike Schmidt, a 38-year-old schoolteacher.
   In less than a week after the ouster of reform-resistant party
leader Erich Honecker, East Germany's news media have shed their
drab and doctrinaire image and given voice to unprecedented debate
over the troubled nation's problems.
   Although the media still toe the party's ``leading role'' line,
the transformation has been as dramatic as it has been swift.
   Long scorned by East Germans who looked West for the news, the
media have embarked on a campaign of relative openness about the
causes of the nation's current unrest.
   The shift has left many East Germans both amazed and skeptical.
   ``For years, the media here were a joke,'' said Joachim Lenz, a
25-year-old student at East Berlin's Humboldt University. ``They
had nothing to do with reality, and the newspapers were full of
interviews with happy workers while the rest were packing up to go
West.''
   One of the most frequent demands made by pro-democracy activists
has been for a freer, more lively press.
   Although there is still no legal alternative to the state-run
press, government media have begun to respond to the widespread
calls for broader, more realistic news coverage.
   A day after Egon Krenz took over as party leader last week,
Neues Deutschland devoted four pages to critical examination of the
nation's problems, including the flight of more than 55,000 East
Germans to the West.
   For the first time in their 40-year history, East Germany's
media have offered prompt coverage of the pro-democracy street
protests and other opposition events.
   On Saturday, two senior Communist Party officials engaged in an
unusually candid debate with East Germans who had just marched
through downtown East Berlin in demand of reforms. Less than two
hours later, footage of the heated exchange between East Berlin
party chief Guenter Schabowski and Mayor Erhard Krack was shown on
the nightly news show ``Aktuelle Kamera.''
   East German television now routinely broadcasts live interviews
with state officials, who were rarely seen a few weeks ago and
whose policies were never questioned openly.
   In a live TV call-in show Thursday, the day after Krenz assumed
power, East Germans grilled Communist officials on the government's
long history of command-style leadership and its tight restrictions
on foreign travel.
   Another television program, geared to teen-agers, broadcast an
interview with a dissident Lutheran Church pastor and concluded:
``We filmed this two weeks ago, but until now we couldn't show it.''
   Junge Welt, one of the most widely read newspapers in the
country, on Saturday carried a forthright report on democratic
developments in Hungary, a first for a publication that had often
ignored the reforms sweeping other East European nations.
   Officials also have revoked a nearly year-old ban on the Soviet
monthly magazine Sputnik, whose critical articles on late Soviet
dictator Josef Stalin and German Communists before World War II had
angered hard-line East German leaders.
   While the discussions of social and economic problems
encumbering East Germany are unprecedented in official media here,
the more candid reports do not yet measure up to the level of
openness of Soviet media since Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev
introduced his policy of glasnost three years ago.
   Direct criticism of officials in power remains absent, and there
have been no challenges to the Communist Party's monopoly on power.
   Many East Germans say government-run media must become far more
critical and objective to gain the confidence of the people.
   ``Right now it's a curiosity, because no one has ever seen this
happening before,'' said Ingrid Mueller, a 45-year-old East Berlin
secretary. ``They still have a long way to go.''

   The Cincinnati Zoo has kept dozens of
antelopes, cows and tigers in an 8-by-8-foot storage closet for
nearly nine years.
   But now, one of the world's largest collections of frozen animal
embryos has outgrown its laboratory, and the zoo has begun work on
a $3.4 million facility expected to open in 14 months.
Groundbreaking was Saturday.
   Dr. Betsy Dresser, director of the zoo's Center for Reproduction
and Endangered Wildlife, is counting on the 16,000-square-foot lab
to help save animals from extinction.
   ``It's a safety net,'' she said. ``Instead of feeding a herd of
rhinoceroses, you can keep them frozen.''
   The ``frozen zoo'' preserves species' genetic material while
conservationists try to save their habitat or find room for them in
captivity.
   ``If we had been able to do this for the dinosaurs, we could
bring them back today,'' she said.
   Despite the limitations of working in the converted mop closet,
she said the frozen zoo has produced 14 world firsts since the
project started in 1981. One was the birth in February of a rare
Indian desert cat through test-tube fertilization of a house cat.
   Successes have spawned similar research programs in San Diego,
Washington and London.
   ``Cincinnati is leading the way,'' said Thomas Foose,
conservation director for the American Association of Zoological
Parks and Aquariums in Bethesda, Md. ``This type of research is
crucial to the survival of a lot of species.''
   Private grants and fund drives will pay for the new center,
which will accommodate up to 50 scientists. Ms. Dresser said
officials hope to encourage scientific as well as financial
interest by offering tours to visitors.

<HEAD>U.S. Bitterness over Vietnam Defeat May Impede Diplomatic Recognition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration's reluctance to grant
diplomatic recognition to Vietnam stems from the bitter legacy of
military defeat, say a handful of congressmen who argue that
Vietnam has met U.S. requirements for improving ties.
   ``We're punishing Vietnam for inflicting a very embarrassing
failure on the U.S.'' 14 years ago, said Rep. Robert Mrazek, D-N.Y.
   Sen. Robert Kerrey, D-Neb., who lost part of a leg in Vietnam,
said the administration ``isn't thinking through its Asian policy
very well. It is driven by the same lack of understanding that led
us to the bumbling mistakes of Vietnam.''
   That argument, however, is rejected by administration officials
and what appears to be a majority in Congress.
   ``Obviously there's a bitter legacy but it doesn't dictate our
policy,'' said a senior administration official, who spoke only on
condition of anonymity.
   As a condition for establishing diplomatic relations with
Vietnam, for the first time since the fall of the U.S.-backed
Saigon government in 1975, the Bush administration demanded an end
to the 11-year Vietnamese military occupation of neighboring
Cambodia.
   The Vietnamese say the last of their troops withdrew from
Cambodia last month. But normalization of ties is stalled over the
make-up of a new Cambodia government that the Bush administration
seeks to replace Hun Sen, installed by Vietnam and still in power.
   The dispute over the Cambodian government, said the Bush
administration official, ``is not a new barrier we've erected to
protect ourselves from the specter of normalization'' with Vietnam.
It is part of the package, he said.
   Critics of administration policy say recognizing Vietnam would
raise U.S. influence throughout the region.
   ``We must, for our strategic and national interests, get back to
Vietnam'' to reassert U.S. influence in Southeast Asia, and compete
with China, the Soviet Union and Japan, said Mrazek.
   U.S. policy is still influenced by ``feelings of anger and
desire for revenge ... motives that ill suit a just and powerful
nation,'' said Rep. Chester Atkins, D-Mass.
   At an international conference on Cambodia in Paris last July,
Vietnam refused to support a proposal to include Cambodia's Khmer
Rouge guerrillas in an interim government that would be led by
U.S.-backed opposition leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk.
   The Khmer Rouge, who ruled Cambodia 1975-78, while in power
killed an estimated 1 million compatriots in an effort to restore
the nation to a primitive agrarian society.
   Khmer Rouge leaders, now fighting a guerrilla war in the jungles
along the Thai-Cambodian border, claim to have changed their ways,
and have strong Chinese backing to be included as one of four
Cambodian factions in a coalition government.
   In Paris, the Vietnamese balked at including the Khmer Rouge,
and are backing Hun Sen.
   The United States accused Vietnam of intransigence, saying
inclusion of the militarily strong Khmer Rouge _ loathsome as it
may be _ is essential for achieving a negotiated settlement in
Cambodia. Such a settlement would include a halt of foreign arms
supplies to all parties, an international monitoring force and free
elections.
   ``In that context, the Khmer Rouge would be containable,'' said
the senior administration official.
   Mrazek and several other lawmakers argue that it is hypocritical
to criticize Vietnam for opposing the Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge,
and accuse the administration of backing a Khmer Rouge presence in
an interim government for fear of antagonizing China.
   Among the administration supporters on the issue is Sen. John
McCain, an Arizona Republican and former prisoner of war, who last
year sponsored a bill to establish low-level diplomatic ties. He
withdrew it when Vietnam suspended cooperation for several months
on the search for missing Americans.
   ``No serious public official in this country will ever tell the
families of the ... Americans still missing in Vietnam that we
intend to proceed with the improvement of relations absent any
realistic expectation of Vietnamese cooperation in determining the
fate of their fathers, husbands, sons and brothers,'' he said in a
recent Washington Post opinion piece.
   Vietnam in recent months has been providing more information on
U.S. MIA's, and has been allowing Vietnamese formerly associated
with Americans or fathered by U.S. servicemen to leave for the
United States.
   Yet Secretary of State James A. Baker III said several months
ago that ``the issue of missing American servicemen must first be
resolved'' before official ties can be forged.
   The administration says progress has been made in accounting for
the estimated 1,700 Americans missing in Vietnam. Another in a
series of U.S. official delegations of officials and forensic
experts is heading for Hanoi later this month.

<HEAD>Abortion Rights Advocates Concede Battle, But Not War Over Bush Veto</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Abortion rights advocates conceded Sunday they
have little chance of overriding President Bush's veto of a bill
allowing Medicaid to pay for abortions for victims of rape or
incest.
   But pro-choice lawmakers and lobbyists said they still will put
up a fight to override Bush's veto on the $157 billion Labor-Health
and Human Services appropriations bill.
   ``The outlook for an override is not good,'' said Marcy Wilder,
a staff attorney for the National Abortion Rights Action League, a
main pro-choice lobbying group.
   While the Senate approved the spending bill, including
relaxation of the Medicaid abortion restrictions, last Thursday by
a 67-31 vote, the House vote a week earlier was 216-206, far short
of the two-thirds that would be needed to override the veto.
   Bush is also threatening to veto two other pending pieces of
legislation over abortion-related issues: a District of Columbia
appropriations bill allowing Medicaid to pay for all abortions for
poor women in the nation's capital, and a foreign operations bill
that would lift restrictions on funding United Nations' family
planning programs.
   Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., a longtime leader of pro-choice
forces in Congress, acknowledged the prospects for an override in
the House now are slim, but he suggested that Congress keep passing
the same appropriations bill.
   If Republicans lose next month's gubernatorial races to
pro-choice Democrats in Virginia and New Jersey, Packwood
predicted, ``you may see a chance in the House'' to override a Bush
abortion veto the second or third time around.
   Packwood, interviewed on Cable News Network's ``Evans &amp; Novak''
show, said Republican lawmakers are shifting under pressure from
constituents toward a more pro-choice stance.
   ``The people in my party are talking about this issue and are
frightened to death of it, and they suddenly see that the tide has
turned,'' said Packwood.
   Bush vetoed the measure Saturday at Camp David, the presidential
retreat in Maryland where he spent the weekend after returning from
Friday's tour of earthquake damage in northern California.
   Bush said he was unwilling to permit federal funding of
abortions ``other than those in which the life of the mother would
be endangered if the fetus were carried to term.'' That is how the
Medicaid law has stood since 1981, he noted.
   Bush personally believes rape and incest victims should have a
legal right to obtain an abortion, but he is unwilling to pay for
the procedure for poor women.
   Douglas Johnson, legislative director of the National Right to
Life Committee, praised Bush for keeping his campaign commitment on
abortion. He said his group, the leading anti-abortion lobby, is
urging its members to contact members of the House to uphold the
veto.
   Rep. Pat Schroeder, D-Colo., a pro-choice lawmaker, said,
``Clearly, we'll try to override. Clearly, that's probably not
going to happen, so he wins.''
   She said that vetoing the Labor-HHS bill threatens funding for
essential health and human services programs.
   ``His veto is stopping the government. ... This is massive. It's
clear he's playing politics to the end,'' she said.

   An air force officer trying to plant a
time bomb in a theater where conservative party leader Constantine
Mitsotakis was to speak was killed early Sunday when it went off
prematurely, police said.
   The blast occured at 12:05 a.m. at the entrance to a ventilation
shaft in the courtyard of Mitilini's Municipal Theater.
   Mitsotakis, who is on a campaign tour of islands in the eastern
Aegean, was scheduled to conclude his visit to Lesbos with a
campaign speech in the theater Sunday afternoon.
   A police official who asked that his name not be used said
33-year-old Warrant Officer Michalis Pavlis was apparently trying
to place the time bomb in the ventilation shaft when it exploded.
Pavlis was killed instantly.
   The bomb went off as hundreds of young supporters of the leftist
Coalition of the Left and Progress party walked out of the theater
following a campaign concert.
   Police said no one was injured.
   Mitsotakis, of the conservative New Democracy Party, was
scheduled to speak in the theater at about 6:30 p.m. He is running
in Nov. 5 national elections.
   Commenting on the explosion at a rally later, Mitsotakis said,
``It's obvious that the aim of terrorism is to hinder the smooth
course toward elections.''
   Mitsotakis' family have already been victims of terrorists.
   His son-in-law, New Democracy deputy Pavlos Bakoyannis, was
gunned down by two assailants Sept. 26 as he entered his downtown
Athens office. The clandestine Greek leftist terrorist group Nov.17
claimed responsibility.
   The country's major political parties all condemned Sunday's
incident.

<HEAD>Lacroix Springs Summerwear, But Luxe Are Deceiving</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Christian Lacroix woke up the fashion crowd Sunday
with his show of bright, peppy clothes in ready-to-wear and
``luxe'' versions for the 1990 summer season.
   Both lines showed some leggy looks, long pants and Lacroix's
curvy cuts. ``Luxe'' was simply richer than ready-to-wear, and will
cost a few thousand dollars more per outfit.
   In both shows, he included some of his oval skirts and fitted
jackets, plus a few of his famous fichu collars and trapeze-line
coats and dresses. Pants ranged from full and cropped to
``cigarette'' slim, under tunic tops and dressy jackets.
   The slightly simplified, sportier ready-to-wear lines led off
with a blue drawstring parka over narrow madras plaid pants, and
color burst out from there on _ often with Lacroix's ebullient
mixes of flowers, checks, plaids.
   It was a sunny, summery collection of high spirits by the young
creator from the sunny south of France, showing sunhats and
beachwear galore this time.
   While many designers were bringing out lots of rusty, even muddy
autumn colors, Lacroix went out for a fresh palette of pinks, reds,
violet, pistachio and chartreuse, in clothes that often came out
looking younger than springtime.
   His fitted suits of huge houndstooth checks came out in
turquoise or chartreuse and black for a striking city look. But the
daisy-printed floral Provencal cotton jackets paired with full
short skirts in a different print were happy-go-lucky Lacroix at
his best.
   He showed a lot of leg in the bloomer shorts or skirts and
bright pistachio or pink linen jackets with big jeweled collars.
   Lacroix's simplest line involved delicate mixes of pastel
twinsets and chocolate brown pleated skirts or straight pants. The
pearl-buttoned knit toppers had puffed organza sleeves rimmed in
gold.
   While some of the brightest patchworks with heart and star print
motifs came out in trapeze-line dresses, much of the collection was
based on sexy bustier tops, especially in multicolored lame brocade
cocktail dresses.
   The ``luxe'' clothes were sometimes dolled up with so much lace
and glitz that the chic was nearly hidden. But there were also some
fabulous clothes in this near-couture line.
   Some of the sweetness nearly got out of hand in this show _ with
the sequined, pink or blue taffeta-ruffled, lace-edged wraparound
dresses _ as the loudspeaker warbled ``May Time,'' by Jeannette
MacDonald.
   Even the ``tiger ladies'' in their chiffon animal prints looked
more innocent than wild, though one was a clinging, ruffled and
gathered number to outline an hourglass figure.
   The chiffons ranged from nice navy numbers with ``godet''
flounces at the knee-length hem for dancing, to some wonderful pink
and raspberry flower prints draped with a big scarf fastened with
an outsized rose at the shoulder.
   Black lace, navy pleated chiffon and sparkling embroidery on
short dresses and pajama outfits topped by tunics ended up this
show that offered the ultimate in dressy summer wear.
   Luxury in a totally different vein was laid on with heavier
brush strokes by Romeo Gigli in his second Paris show.
   Currently the darling of the fashion world, Gigli, 39, prefers
the madcap Paris fashion whirl to his native Italy for showing his
clothes. After last spring's hit show, this second offering was
played to a packed, enthusiastic house.
   It was a case where the clothes wore the women. Models minced
down the runway looking barely able to walk, constrained by silky,
gossamer shoulder wraps, puffed tutu-skirt effects over lean silk
trousers worn with colored tights and flat sandals.
   The outfits were treated as artwork. They ranged between
Byzantine and Oriental opulence, with the most dazzling iridescent
silks, lace, velvet, gold-threaded sheer fabrics often in the burnt
colors of autumn.
   It was like looking at a series of paintings rather than clothes
to wear to a party. Full, stiffened tent-like shortie coats over
figured pants had the look of hieratic characters in a Byzantine
mosaic, especially with the flowing pearled earrings bigger than
chandeliers draped over the shoulders.
   But Gigli can cut, and his slim iridescent or metallic lame silk

<HEAD>White Officer Goes on Trial in Death of Blacks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A policeman goes on trial Monday in the deaths of
two blacks as Miami moves to head off a repeat of the race riots
touched off by the case.
   Acquittals of police officers in the deaths of blacks sparked
violence here in 1980 and 1984. The impeachment conviction Friday
of a popular black federal judge, a heated local election campaign
and the drug war could raise tensions.
   William Lozano, 32, is charged with manslaughter in the Jan. 16
shooting of motorcyclist Clement Lloyd and the death of passenger
Allan Blanchard in the ensuing crash. Lozano said Lloyd tried to
run him over and he fired in self-defense.
   The deaths touched off three days of rioting that claimed two
lives and caused $1 million damage as Miami was getting ready to be
host of the Super Bowl.
   Lozano, a native Colombian whose brother is also on the force,
is viewed by many in the area's prominent Hispanic community as a
political scapegoat being sacrificed to ease racial tensions. They
have raised thousands for his defense.
   To blacks, Lozano is proof that white police officers put lower
value on a black life.
   Defense attorney Roy Black says fear of a riot prompted him to
ask Circuit Judge Joseph Farina to move the trial, a request Farina
is expected to take up Monday.
   The city plans to have all 1,100 police officers on call at the
end of the trial, expected to last three weeks. It also has ordered
700 gas masks and has two armored personnel carriers and National
Guard military equipment available.
   A community relations board has been advising residents on how
to avoid violence, and a rumor-control hotline was set up.
   Black plans to tell jurors that Lloyd was fleeing from another
officer who had tried to pull him over and that the motorcyclist,
whose neck and wrists were laden with gold and diamonds, was a drug
dealer with good reason to flee.
   When killed, he had a suspended license, $1,500 cash and a bag
of marijuana in his pocket, cocaine, alcohol and marijuana in his
blood and an arrest record for marijuana possession, according to
authorities.
   Assistant State Attorney John Hogan counters that Lloyd's
troubles are irrelevant and that Lozano shot without justification.
   The shooting came just hours after thousands of blacks paraded
in memory of Martin Luther King Jr.

<HEAD>Earthquake Survivor Becoming Hero In Mountain Town</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WEAVERVILLE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This mountain town of gas stations
and Gold Rush ghosts is embracing a new local legend _ Buck Helm,
the man who cheated death under a big-city freeway.
   ``Now when tourists ask what's so special around here, we can
tell 'em we have a citizen who survived four days under a
freeway,'' said Bill Lawrence, who with his wife Patsy runs the Old
Yellow House Bed and Breakfast on Main Street.
   ``He's the legend of Weaverville,'' said Mrs. Lawrence.
   On Sunday, a day after Helm, 57, was pulled from beneath
Oakland's earthquake-collapsed double-deck I-880, the little town
was socked in by rain and fog. Deerhunters rowded the Diggins
Tavern, the mountain roads too muddy for hunting.
   Two small boys floated a makeshift craft down the rushing gutter
on the main street amid the smell of wet leaves and roar of pickup
trucks.
   Across the street from the Weaverville Hotel, a small crowd
gathered to await the arrival of a newspaper vendor so they could
read front-page news about ``Old Buck.''
   ``Buck likes to tell a good story,'' laughed Jim Nickerson, who
waited with the others. ``He'll get to tell this at least 3,500
times.''
   Nickerson was referring to the population of Weaverville, a
historic Gold Rush town 250 miles north of San Francisco in the
Trinity Mountains that is now dependent on timber, sportsmen and
tourists.
   Church bells rang through the valley, and congregations prayed
for Helm, many aware that his condition remains critical from the
ordeal of four days pinned in his car beneath the freeway.
   ``We're praying for Buck in all our Masses,'' said the Rev. John
Lawrence, the pastor at the Catholic Church here. ``Everybody is so
glad he's alive.''
   ``We're asking the Lord to strengthen and heal him,'' said Deena
Farris, wife of the pastor at Faith Family Center.
   ``Buck isn't a churchgoer,'' said Peggy McConnell, a friend.
``But there is a spirituality about him and that's one of the
reasons he survived.''
   Many here are acquainted with Helm, but those who know him well
seem few, even though he has lived here off and on since boyhood.
He finally moved his wife and children back for good several years
ago.
   He and his wife Lorene have since divorced, but friends say they
remain close. Family members rushed to Oakland to be with Helm, who
spends the workweek on the Oakland docks, sleeping in a van, and
weekends at home.
   ``Buck has always had a real sense of family,'' said Emily
Brady, the proprietor of a hunting and fishing store.
   ``And he is generous too, with himself and his money,'' said
Mrs. Lawrence. She and others recalled how Helms spent his state
tax refund this year on an ``ice-cream cone incentive fund'' for
kids who did well at his daughter Desiree's fifth-grade class.
   Weaverville Chamber of Commerce President Randy Weathers hasn't
had time to think about how to honor Weaverville's suddenly famous
son.
   ``But this town will throw a big party when Buck gets back, you
can bet on it,'' said Patsy Lawrence.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., predicted
Sunday that $3.5 billion in federal earthquake aid would be
approved this week, but said damage estimates from Tuesday's quake
were already more than twice that amount.
   ``Unfortunately, all the cost cannot be covered'' by government
aid, Cranston told reporters. ``There will be some loss.''
   Property losses and damage to local roads are estimated at $6.12
billion by local governments, with damage to state and federal
highways at an additional $1 billion, Cranston said.
   The senator said state government, with its $1 billion surplus,
would have to provide money and the federal government would
probably increase its contribution later. In addition, insurance
will cover some losses; Cranston said 15 to 25 percent of damaged
commercial property was insured, but he couldn't say how many
damaged homes carried earthquake coverage.
   The $7.12 billion damage total was at least $650 million higher
than the estimate provided Sunday by Lisa Covington, spokeswoman
for the state Office of Emergency Services. But Cranston said the
damage figures were rising constantly and ``will probably go much
higher before we're finished.''
   Cranston, the Senate majority whip, said about $3.5 billion in
earthquake aid would be added Monday to a House appropriation bill
that must be passed by Wednesday to keep the government functioning.
   ``I have no doubt about our capacity to produce that money'' in
Congress, Cranston said, predicting no difficulty in getting the
votes to waive the Gramm-Rudman federal spending limit or other
legal restrictions on federal disaster aid.
   ``Every state has had an earthquake,'' he said. ``No senator, no
House member can say, `This is never going to affect me.'''
   Federal aid would include $1.44 billion for the Federal Emergecy
Management Administration, $1 billion in highway funds, $1 billion
for low-interest loans from the Small Business Administration, and
$50 million for veterans' hospitals in Palo Alto and Martinez,
Cranston said.
   He said the first federal funds could be available within a week
for these programs:
   _Temporary housing grants from FEMA for those made homeless by
the earthquake.
   _Grants of up to $10,000 from FEMA for family assistance.
   _For homeowners without earthquake insurance, SBA loans of up to
$100,000 for real estate and up to $20,000 for furniture and other
personal property. The 30-year loans would be at 4 percent to 8
percent interest.
   _For businesses, SBA loans of up to $500,000 to repair
earthquake damage or raise working capital because of quake-related
needs.
   Gov. George Deukmejian has also said the state will provide
supplemental grants of up to $10,000 for the neediest families and
individuals.
   FEMA officials said Saturday that until federal aid was
approved, the displaced could seek emergency shelter with the Red
Cross or pay for a hotel and seek reimbursement from the
government. The agency was to open disaster-aid centers Sunday in
each of the seven counties suffering earthquake damage.

   The blackboard in front of the student
union lists Monday's main volunteer need _ help in transporting
injured and displaced students around campus in golf carts.
   A sign nearby calls for cash donations to the Red Cross. Tables
that usually have political fliers or information on campus events
now are covered with emergency numbers and details of destruction.
   A few weeks after the start of the school year, Stanford
University students are getting a lesson in coping with an
earthquake.
   Twenty-six of Stanford's 240 buildings, including the beautiful
Memorial Church in the heart of the campus, were rendered unsafe
after the Oct. 17 quak, and 34 more were restricted to limited
access as repair estimates soared to $200 million.
   More than 1,600 of the 13,000 students were displaced the night
of the quake, including 500 who remain homeless because of the
closing of old fraternity and club houses.
   One of the biggest concerns, besides cracked walls and damaged
equipment and furnishings, is asbestos exposure from the quake.
   The landmark Hoover Tower, home of the Hoover Institution and
repository for millions of artifacts, and the main building of the
Graduate School of Business have been closed pending asbestos
inspections.
   ``Considerable academic anxiety'' has struck the campus,
university president Donald Kennedy said. ``Most students are still
unable to enter the library; many have been unable to retrieve
books and notes from buildings that have been closed; many have
been unable to obtain informations on classes, and still others
have not been able to re-enter their residences.''
   Student volunteers worked through the weekend picking up
crumpled books, metal and plaster at the Law Library. Others moved
the organ from the church, picked through debris in laboratories
and swept up classrooms and dorms.
   The damage is not nearly as bad as in 1906, when the campus was
virtually destroyed by the Great Earthquake. But last week's quake
is taking its toll on students.
   The Memorial Church, with its mosaic tiles and stained glass
windows, was partially destroyed in 1906, four years after its
completion, and restored in 1913.
   The major damage this time was to the arch near the altar. The
keystone _ the central block in an archway _ was more than a
half-inch off center and may have to be rebuilt.
   ``In general, Stanford has done a good job of risk management,''
said Haresh Shah, chairman of the Civil Engineering Department and
one of the world's leading earthquake experts. ``The structural
seismic work that we have been doing the past five years has really
paid off.
   Stanford began a program in 1986 to assess earthquake risk in
older buildings and add seismic bracing. Just weeks after
completing recommended bracing projects in the Roble Hall dorm and
the Old Pavilion, both buildings came through unscathed.
   So did the landmark Lou Henry Hoover House, home to university
president Kennedy, although there was heavy damage to the contents.
   Scientific laboraties also were largely undamaged, as was the
medical center and the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center.
   Stanford will have to foot the cost of the bill itself out of
its endowment, loans and other funds. The university had earthquake
insurance from 1980 to 1985, but then the insuring companies
canceled the policy.
   The university decided to become self-insured, and as of Aug. 31
it had $3.4 million in an earthquake reserve and $3.6 million in a
property reserve.

   Aptos Creek murmured
softly Sunday over the epicenter of Northern California's deadly
earthquake, its serenity belying the ruined towns, broken highways
and bridges and shattered lives for miles around.
   While crews at the collapsed Nimitz Freeway in Oakland continued
working amid twisted steel and crumbled concrete at a scene of
almost unimaginable horror, a few uprooted trees and minor
landslides were the only visible signs of the quake at its
epicenter here in the Forest of Nisene Marks State Park.
   Jays and squirrels chattered from the canopy of branches high
over head. A rockslide blocked the Aptos Creek fire road above the
old Loma Prieta lumber mill.
   Farther up the mountain, a few mossy trees had toppled across
the trail leading to the headwaters of Aptos Creek, tentatively
identified by geologists as the center of the 6.9-magnitude temblor.
   For geologists, the epicenter represents more symbol than
significance, said Robert Uhrhammer, a research seismologist at the
University of California Seismographic Station at Berkeley.
   ``The epicenter is just a point on the surface immediately above
the point where the rupture first started,'' Uhrhammer said.
Geologists believe that point is about 11 miles below Aptos Creek.
   For major quakes, however, the point of the rupture breaks into
a fracture many miles long that releases tremendous amounts of
energy as geological plates slip and slide violently past each
other.
   The Forest of Nisene Marks State Park is a lush maze of ridges
and canyons formed by the Earth's twists and contortions along the
faults that run diagonally across it.
   The park was created in 1963 when two brothers of a locally
prominent farming family, aided by the Nature Conservancy, donated
9,600 acres to the state in memory of their mother, Nisene, with
the stipulation that it never be developed.
   Most of the park was clear-cut in a 40-year logging frenzy that
ended in the 1920s, said park ranger Gerald E. Waggoner. Loggers
cut 140 million board feet of lumber from the area.
   While isolated stands of towering redwoods thousands of years
old remain in spots, the Santa Cruz Mountains supplied much of the
timber used to rebuild San Francisco after the great quake of 1906.
   At the turn of the century the Loma Preita Mill was the largest
in Santa Cruz county, employing 600 workers in the summers,
Waggoner said.
   ``It was a company town,'' he said.
   The once-denuded forest was donated to the state in 1963, and
red alder, big-leaf maples, tan bark oak and second-generation
redwoods are making comebacks.
   ``This is a hidden forest here,'' said Steve Shaw, an Aptos
resident who paused from his jog along the fire road. ``It's not
marked on any highways and most of us locals treat it like our own
preserve.''
   Other runners passing in the forest exchanged quake-related
pleasantries.
   ``Did your house make out OK?'' one voice asked, echoing among
the trees.
   ``Oh, we lost a chimney and a plate-glass window,'' another
voice replied. ``But we did pretty well.''

people in the industry treat a fellow differently after he's made
it.
   ``The people in the business are for you when you're
beginning,'' Travis said. ``Then, once you achieve success they
say, `Well, that's enough _ you're over,' or whatever.''
   Travis, who has won more than 40 awards since 1986, went
empty-handed when the Country Music Association gave out its awards
recently in Nashville. His last album, ``Old 8 X 10,'' has sold 1.5
million copies since its release last year.
   He said the people whose opinions count most to him don't seem
to be put off by his success.
   ``The people that you call the fans are not much that way,''

   A judge says he will study a poll that
concludes the former husband of John Wayne's daughter could never
get a fair trial here because of The Duke's popularity.
   Lawyers for Dr. Thomas Gionis claim he should not be tried in
Orange County on charges he conspired to hire men to beat up Aissa
Wayne, daughter of the late actor, and her then-boyfriend Roger
Luby a year ago during a custody battle.
   Wayne, a resident of Newport Beach, died 10 years ago. The
county airport is named after him and has an 8-foot bronze statue
of him at the entrance.
   Gionis, facing trial Oct. 31, has asked that the trial be moved
based on a defense-commissioned poll that found 46 percent of the
200 people questioned believe the Pomona surgeon is guilty.
   A pollster for the prosecution said the poll interviewed too few
people, excluded too many groups of people and was worded to elicit
certain responses.

   But the latest Cash Box magazine lists his independent-lable
single, ``We Both Were in Love With You,'' at No. 57 and climbing.
In addition, the 37-year-old Cisco's ``Between Hello and Goodbye,''
released last summer, made it all the way to No. 7 on one
independent-label chart and reached No. 27 on another.

   A bite from a poisonous water moccasin snake
wasn't enough to keep Houston Oilers coach Jerry Glanville away
from Sunday's game.
   Glanville arrived on crutches at the Astrodome for the game
against the Pittsburgh Steelers, one day after the snake bit him on
the foot while he walked through high grass near his home. Inside
the stadium, Glanville discarded the crutches and went onto the
field with the team without a limp.
   He had been hospitalized overnight. Tests revealed a low level
of venom from the snake, and he was given a shot to counteract the
poison.

   Leaders of the 49-nation
Commonwealth on Sunday gave South Africa six months to deliver on
reform promises or face new reprisals, and they called for tighter
financial pressure immediately. Britain alone dissented.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, rejecting key
provisions of the Commonwealth summit declaration on South Africa,
charged that U.S. and Commonwealth embargoes have strengthened
white extremism in South Africa.
   But she went along with a stipulation that current trade
embargoes remain for the time being.
   In its declaration, the organization of Britain and its former
colonies held off on seeking new embargoes for at least six months.
   Britain objected to provisions setting up a new body to
scrutinize South Africa's financial links and declaring that a
foreign ministers' committee, which monitors sanctions and suggests
new ones, will meet in six months.
   The 12-page declaration gave muted acknowledgment of reform
moves by South Africa's new president, F.W. de Klerk, who has said
the black majority could have a role in politics in five years.
   It said there was a ``possibility that significant changes in
approach on the part of the South African regime ... may yet prove
to be within reach.''
   The declaration was issued Sunday after final approval by the
Commonwealth leaders at a weekend retreat at Langkawi island, 210
miles northwest of here.
   In a separate statement Sunday, Mrs. Thatcher said, ``There
seems to be a clear correlation between the imposition of
additional sanctions by the U.S. Congress and the Commonwealth and
the strength of extreme right-wing parties in South Africa utterly
opposed to change.''
   The statement took other countries by surprise. A senior
Commonwealth official, requesting anonymity, called it
``despicable.''
   British Foreign Secretary John Major, who was on the committee
that drew up the final Commonwealth declaration, said it showed ``a
novel recognition'' by the Commonwealth that change is beginning in
South Africa and that sanctions should not be punitive.
   Tanzanian Foreign Minister Ben Wmkapa called Major's
interpretation was ``laughable.''
   ``This declaration expresses our judgment that South Africa has
undertaken no fundamental changes,'' Wmpaka said in an interview.
``What's he crowing about?''
   Canadian External Affairs Secretary Joe Clark, head of the
committee, said ``nobody is buying'' that de Klerk has shifted away
from apartheid, the system that denies the black majority the vote.
   The declaration noted that de Klerk had ``accepted a degree of
peaceful political activity by the black majority and on the eve of
this meeting had released from prison eight political leaders.''
   In parts of the declaration, the tone was milder than that of
previous Commonwealth pronouncements on South Africa, and it
stressed the need for peaceful change.
   The declaration incorporated an Australian proposal that the
Commonwealth call on international banks to restrict South African
trade credits to a maximum of 90 days and urge governments to make
it more difficult for South Africa to get credits.
   It also said that a U.N. arms embargo should be intensified.
   Current Commonwealth embargoes consist of 11 voluntary
sanctions, including a ban on air links, drawn up in 1986.
   Britain refuses to impose most of the Commonwealth embargoes.
Black African states, which depend economically on South Africa, do
not impose them.
   The sanctions fall well short of those imposed by the United
States.

   More than 500 East Germans gathered Sunday in a
Leipzig concert hall to talk with local Communist Party officials
about reforms under consideration in the wake of last week's
leadership change.
   Lutheran Church sources in Leipzig said another pro-democracy
protest was planned Monday night to keep up pressure on the
government to implement reforms.
   Church sources in East Berlin said religious leaders in Dresden
have compiled a report detailing alleged incidents of police
brutality during demonstrations two weeks ago.
   The report lists 100 allegations of police beatings and other
mistreatment of protesters, the sources said. It also quotes
witnesses as saying many of those detained were strip-searched and
beaten with clubs.
   West Germany's ZDF television network quoted witnesses as saying
one woman was struck in the stomach three times despite cries to
police captors that she was pregnant.
   East Germany's official news agency ADN said the meeting Sunday
at Leipzig's Gewandhaus concert house included ``citizens from all
parts of society'' _ prominent local Communist Party officials,
artists, students, scientists and workers.
   No details of the discussions were provided by the news agency,
other than that they covered ``topical problems'' in East Germany.
   The news agency said the orchestra's conductor, Kurt Masur, was
among the participants, and he suggested such meetings be held
every Sunday to get the public involved in solving social problems.
   Leipzig's Communist officials have pledged to start talking to
the people following massive pro-democracy protests, the largest
since a 1953 workers' uprising, that brought tens of thousands into
the streets of Leipzig this month.
   In an even more unusual gesture toward dialogue, East Berlin
party chief Guenter Schabowski and Mayor Erhard Krack engaged in a
heated debate with pedestrians Saturday after an unauthorized march
by activists through the streets of East Berlin.
   That discussion touched on travel restrictions and public
skepticism about the sincerity of the newly touted reforms. It was
broadcast less than two hours later on state-run television's
nightly news program.
   Much of the change has occurred since Wednesday, when
77-year-old leader Erich Honecker was ousted and replaced by his
protege, Egon Krenz, 52.
   ADN reported Sunday that Politburo member Harry Tisch, head of
East Germany's labor federation, has called for more independence
for the nation's labor unions as a step toward reform.
   ``I think it is better if the unions find and represent their
own positions,'' Tisch said, apparently refering to the labor
movement's traditional advocacy of party policies.
   Also Sunday, ADN reported that one of East Germany's most
prominent actresses, Kaethe Reichel, held a reading in East
Berlin's Deutsches Theater against violence and misuse of authority.
   At the end of the presentation, Ms. Reichel also read a
statement signed by East Berlin actors and actresses demanding a
complete investigation into allegations of police brutality during
pro-democracy demonstrations.
   At least 1,000 people were reported to have been arrested
earlier this month when mass demonstrations broke out in Leipzig
surrounding the 40th anniversary of East German statehood Oct. 7.
   Activists have complained that police used brute force to break
up some of the peaceful marches, and authorities have recently
promised to look into those allegations.

   Mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne sang a marvelous
Rosina in Rossini's ``The Barber of Seville'' on Saturday, proving
she's doing what she has said she wants: quit while she's ahead.
   Miss Horne is singing the first five performances of ``Barber''
at the Metropolitan Opera this season, her farewell to that opera.
She first sang Rosina 27 years ago in San Francisco, and has
decided to drop certain operas from her repertoire.
   Saturday afternoon's ``Barber'' was unusually amusing. It's easy
to make the action too broad, but this cast, which kicked up its
heels a bit more than most, just added jollity and didn't go too
far.
   Paata Burchuladze, the Russian bass, sings with effortless
richness, even on the lowest notes. In the ensemble in which he's
front and center, he took charge of the stage with comic assurance
but without trying to steal the show.
   Tenor Michael Cousins made a Metropolitan Opera debut as Count
Almaviva because Stanford Olsen was sick. Cousins began with some
strain in coloratura passages but that subsided, and the impression
he left is of a pleasing tone; it isn't a beautiful voice but it
was a Met debut to note. His strongest suit is his stage demeanor;
he acted the role to perfection.
   Two outstanding singers of the afternoon were baritones and
father and son. The son, Gino Quilico, was Figaro. He sings the
role with a more finely focused tone than many and in Act 1 he
presented a rather stiff Figaro. But in Act 2, he loosened up and
added to the fun. One hopes that he and his father enjoyed the
shaving scene as much as the audience did.
   Louis Quilico was Rosina's guardian. He sang a marvelous
overstuffed but foxy gent.
   The orchestral music was ebullient, under the baton of Julius
Rudel.
   Baritone Motti Kaston, who has been in the Metropolitan Opera
Young Artist Program, made a favorable impression in his Met debut
as Almaviva's servant.
   The Rossina, traditionally, can choose the aria to sing in the
lesson scene. Miss Horne chose ``La mia pace-La mia calma,'' which
probably hasn't been sung since Rossini's time. It was first sung
in Bologne in 1816 after the opera's premiere in Rome earlier that
year.
   It showcased the voice of this mezzo-soprano who will be greatly
missed by connoisseurs of ``Barber.''

<HEAD>With AM-East German Media, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet newspaper said Sunday that economic and
social problems piled up for years in East Germany under Erich
Honecker, despite glowing official press reports of the situation
there.
   In an article titled ``G.D.R.: Fresh Air of Renewal,''
correspondent V. Nikitin of the labor daily Trud wrote the first
Soviet press report on East Germany that admits earlier reports
glossed over the Soviet ally's problems.
   Although there had been hints of Kremlin dissatisfaction before,
the Trud article contained the strongest criticism in the East
German and Soviet media of Honecker's policies.
   ``The mass media seemed to shut themselves off from reality and
kept on reporting about achievements and overfulfilled plans,''
Nikitin wrote from East Berlin.
   ``Our colleagues from the (German Democratic Republic) were
forced, as once we were, to write about not what existed but about
what one wanted to exist. On some days, for example, one could see
dozens of pictures showing former First Secretary'' Honecker in the
official party daily, Nikitin said.
   While the whitewashing continued, the correspondent wrote, East
Germany's economic development slowed because of too much
centralized control, and ``problems in economic, social and public
spheres were piling up in the republic.''
   Honecker, 77, stepped down Wednesday as Communist Party leader
after 18 years in power. Trud noted that as soon as his
replacement, Egon Krenz, took office, news organizations became
more frank in reporting the country's problems.
   Honecker cited health reasons for resigning, but widespread
dissatisfaction with his authoritarian government, which has led
about 55,000 East Germans to flee West in recent weeks, had
increased pressure for a change.
   Most Soviet press reports have criticized the fleeing East
Germans, but Nikitin was sympathetic.
   ``The republic has suffered a big moral and material blow from
the last wave of illegal emigration of tens of thousands of G.D.R.
citizens'' to West Germany, he wrote. ``Mainly young people have
left the country: skilled workers, scientific and technical
intellectuals, medical workers. And they ran away not from
poverty.''
   He suggested many people left because of wage leveling, a lack
of dialogue with the leadership and travel restrictions.
   People also were upset that they were not given information
about reforms in the Soviet Union, the Trud correspondent wrote.
   ``People were informed only about earthquakes and catastrophes,
inter-ethnic clashes, tea and sugar rationing. ...It seemed that
somebody did not want to say the truth about reforms in the
(Soviet) economy, democratization in public and political life,
about formation of a real people's parliament, about other profound
reforms in our country with all its problems, sufferings and
hopes.''

   The man who would be king could find great
bargains in Dallas over the weekend.
   The Shakespeare Festival of Dallas held a rummage sale Saturday
and Sunday to get rid of many unneeded costumes and props.
   A purple king's robe was going for $85 and upper-body armor was
priced at $50. Body leotards decorated with leaves and flowers,
worn by wood sprites in a production of ``A Midsummer Night's
Dream,'' were priced at $10 apiece.
   ``I came in here not thinking I was going to buy anything,''
said Sally Nelson. ``I bought the crown not only for myself but for
my two young nieces. I always enjoyed playing dress-up when I was a
kid and pretending I was a princess.''
   Managing director DeJon Malley Hill said the handmade costumes
and other props from 15 years of festival productions were
expendable because the company's plays are never presented in the
same way.
   The sale, which included some more contemporary castoffs such as
women's dresses, a hubcap and a talking teddy bear, raised about
$2,800 in its first day.
   Sale proceeds will benefit the festival, which sustained a heavy
financial loss when its stage was blown apart by a storm last
summer. The 1990 season will offer productions of ``Pericles,
Prince of Tyre'' and ``Twelfth Night.''

<HEAD>Deputy Attacked First By Gorbachev, Then Soviet Press</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Days after Mikhail Gorbachev called for his ouster
from the Communist Party, parliamentarian Yuri Afanasyev has come
under attack from the state-run press in a campaign reminiscent of
those waged against dissidents before the glasnost era.
   The attacks, which came nearly every day last week, have
centered on the maverick historian's harsh criticism of the party
and his siding with Japan in a territorial dispute with the Kremlin.
   Such repeated harsh criticism of political activists by name is
rare under glasnost, Gorbachev's policy of openness, and appears a
throwback to the rule of President Leonid I. Brezhnev. In those
days, such attacks often preceded the jailing or exiling of
dissidents.
   Afanasyev, 55, is head of the Moscow State Historical Archives
Institute and a member of the Congress of People's Deputies.
   In an Oct. 13 meeting, Gorbachev reportedly accused Afanasyev
and two economists of joining with Communist legislator Boris N.
Yeltsin to form ``a fascist clique striving for power.''
   They men belong to a parliamentary opposition group. Informed
Soviet sources said Gorbachev told the meeting Afanasyev should be
thrown out of the Communist Party.
   The historian was traveling out of the country Sunday and
unavailable for comment.
   Afanasyev was well known to intellectuals nationwide for his
participation in ``Memorial,'' a group trying to build a monument
and research center in memory of the victims of dictator Josef
Stalin's terror.
   He gained wider fame in a nationally televised speech in May to
the Congress of People's Deputies.
   With Gorbachev looking on, Afanasyev said the Soviet leader had
either listened to or influenced an ``aggressively obedient
majority'' in the Congress to elect a ``Brezhnevist-Stalinist''
Supreme Soviet. The Supreme Soviet is the full-time legislature.
   The state-run press and other deputies criticized Afanasyev for
his remarks at the time.
   On Tuesday, the Russian party daily Sovietsksya Rossiya said
Afanasyev believes the official ideology of Marxism-Leninism is
outmoded. It asked: ``Isn't it more honest for him to leave the
party?''
   On the same day, the central party daily Pravda quoted Afanasyev
as telling a Leningrad meeting that the party has no authority and
in 70 years of power has led the country nowhere.
   Pravda said Afanasyev, who appears frequently at rallies of
unofficial political groups and speaks in a booming baritone, never
backs up his charges and has turned from historian to priest.
   Pravda took the campaign a step further Friday with an article
titled ``Irresponsibility'' _ referring to comments Afanasyev made
two days earlier in Tokyo at a symposium on Gorbachev's reform
program.
   According to the Asahi Evening News, Afanasyev told the meeting
he feels the Soviet Union should return four islands Japan wants
because the dispute over them, dating back to World War II, is
preventing normal relations.
   The Soviets occupied the Kuril Islands, north of Hokkaido, after
the end of fighting in 1945 and have refused to return them.
   Pravda reported Afanasyev's remarks but did not point out that
he said they were his personal opinion.
   It told Soviet readers the Japanese have found ``among our
countrymen an open and extremely active ally'' in the dispute.
   The capital's local party newspaper, Moskovskaya Pravda, joined
the campaign Saturday, reprinting an article from Afanasyev's home
district newspaper accusing him of trying to discredit the party.

<HEAD>Focus on Quake Aid Blurs Deficit Outlook</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress will spend much of this week spending
money, including billions for earthquake disaster relief, while
also trying not to lose sight of the need for reducing the federal
deficit.
   California's House delegation planned to seek an aid package
Monday at a meeting of the House Appropriations Committee, and
Speaker Thomas S. Foley said he expected Congress to act quickly.
   Congress has asked the president's budget office for an official
cost estimate by Monday morning, but administration officials said
Sunday more time may be required as the damage estimates from the
San Francisco Bay area continue to escalate.
   ``It's an evolving situation...,'' Transportation Secretary
Samuel Skinner said Sunday on CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation'' program.
``I don't think we want to jump to a number.''
   Foley on Friday said he expected that Washington would have to
provide $2.5 billion in earthquake relief. California Lt. Gov. Leo
McCarthy on Sunday put the needed federal aid at $3.3 billion; Sen.
Alan Cranston, D-Calif., raised it to $3.5 billion and Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., said he expects the figure to rise to $5
billion before it's all over.
   ``I'm sure we'll reach closure on what is a realistic number,''
Skinner said.
   Moynihan, interviewed on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' program, said
he expected most of the earthquake aid to come from the $12 billion
accumulated in the Federal Highway Trust Fund.
   But he said President Bush should use the earthquake and
Hurricane Hugo last month to call for a massive new public works
program financed by an increase in gasoline taxes to repair the
nation's infrastructure.
   ``If ever there was a moment to talk about increasing the
gasoline tax, now is the moment when people have those pictures of
the Nimitz Expressway still in their minds,'' Moynihan said.
``Let's get this country fixed up.''
   The initial disaster assistance was expected to become part of a
stopgap spending bill required because Congress and the president
have failed to enact the annual appropriations for fiscal 1990,
which began Oct. 1. The government has been operating on an interim
spending bill which expires Oct. 25.
   Full House action on the bill was expected Tuesday, with speedy
Senate consideration to follow.
   The costly disasters struck while Congress has been looking for
ways to reduce the federal deficit. A House-Senate conference
committee is trying to settle money disputes between the two
chambers, including President Bush's demand for a cut in the
capital gains tax rate.
   The House has approved a cut as part of its anti-deficit
package, but opponents in the Senate _ including Democratic Leader
George Mitchell _ kept it off the Senate version.
   Mitchell said Friday he didn't think the Senate would pass a
capital gains cut this year, and he accused those who are pushing
it of being irresponsible.
   The continuing deficit problem will soon force Congress to
approve Bush's request for another increase in the national debt.
   But Foley said lawmakers had to put aside their concern for the
deficit when it came to providing money for the disaster victims.
   ``It would be very unfair to affected areas... to say, well, we
can't meet these obligations because we have a budget crunch,''
Foley said. ``We have to respond.''
   The talks on the deficit-reduction bill were also a victim of
the earthquake, as key lawmakers had to turn their attention to the
disaster. House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif.,
represents a district including the center of the quake.
   The budget talks were expected to resume this week. Aside from
the capital gains fight, lawmakers were trying to decide how to
handle such touchy issues as repealing the Medicare catastrophic
health plan and expanding federal child care subsidies.
   Bush's veto Saturday night of a $156.7 billion appropriation
bill for the Labor and Health and Human Services departments
because it liberalizes federal spending on abortion also sends that
issue back to Congress.
   The Senate planed to debate Monday a bill setting up a
commission to study the seven-month old strike by machinists,
pilots and flight attendants against Eastern Airlines.
   The bill is a watered-down version of a measure introduced
shortly after the strike began in March _ and opposed by President
Bush _ that would have established an emergency board empowered to
recommend a way to end the walkout.
   Both the House and Senate plan to work on some of the regular
fiscal 1990 spending bills, covering a wide range of programs
including agriculture, justice and transportation.
   The transportation bill, as passed by the Senate, includes $1.1
billion above what the White House recommended for anti-drug
programs and the two chambers are working on a final version.
   The House and Senate negotiators have already agreed on another
issue on the bill _ a ban on smoking on virtually all domestic
flights.

   Pope John Paul II on Sunday beatified an
Italian priest-journalist, the French founder of an order of nuns,
and seven Thais killed by police in 1940 for refusing to renounce
Catholicism.
   Beatification is a step toward possible sainthood.
   The pontiff performed the beatifications during a Mass at St.
Peter's Basilica. Sunday also was the 11th anniversary of John
Paul's installation as pope, and two children presented him with
flowers during the ceremony to mark the anniversary.
   The seven Thais beatified were killed by local police in
northeastern Thailand during a period in which Thailand was at war
with French Indochina and authorities suppressed practices
considered ``foreign,'' such as following Roman Catholicism.
   They were Philip Siphong, a catechist and leader of the Catholic
community in the village of Songkhon; two nuns, Sister Agnes Phila
and Sister Lucia Khambang, both of whom taught school in Songkhon;
Agatha Phutta, who helped in the kitchen of the mission at
Songkhon; and three teen-agers from the village, Cecilia Butsi, 16,
Bibiana Khamphai, 15, and Maria Phon, 14.
   Also beatified was the Rev. Giuseppe Giaccardo, an Italian who
became the first priest in the Society of St. Paul, which aims to
spread Christianity through the media. Giaccardo was director of a
Catholic newspaper in northern Italy for many years. He was named
vicar general of the Society of St. Paul shortly before his death
in 1948.
   The pope also beatified a French nun, Marie de Jesus
Deluil-Martiny of Marseilles, founder of the Congregation of the
Daughters of the Heart of Jesus. She established convents in
Belgium and France.
   The nun was killed in 1884 by a convent gardener who turned
against religion.

   The International Committee of the Red Cross
appealed to PLO chairman Yasser Arafat and Syria's vice president
for help in bringing about the release of two orthopedic
technicians kidnapped in Lebanon, a Red Cross spokesman said Sunday.
   Juerg Bischoff said the organization's chief Middle East
delegate, Angelo Gnaedinger, met Syria's Abdel-halim Chaddam in
Damascus on Saturday to ask for assistance.
   A letter from Red Cross President Cornelio Sommaruga was
delivered Friday to Arafat in Tunisia. It urged the PLO leader to
use his influence in securing the release of the two kidnapped men,
and it welcomed the PLO's condemnation of the abductions, Bischoff
said.
   Emanuel Christen, 32, and Elio Erriquez, 23, were kidnapped Oct.
6 in the southern city of Sidon by a masked gunman who piled them
into a car trunk and sped off in the direction of a Palestinian
refugee camp on the outskirts of the city.
   After the abductions, the Red Cross closed its orthopedic
center, where the two men worked. The center provided artificial
limbs to victims of the Lebanese civil war.
   The PLO and Sidon police contend that Emmanuel and Enriquez are
held by the Fatah Revolutionary Council, a breakaway guerilla group
led by Palestinian terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal. The group has
denied the accusation.
   There are 18 Westerners held hostage in Lebanon, including eight
Americans. The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle
East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March
16, 1985.

<HEAD>Quake Shelter Relocation Angers Quake Victims</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The shutdown of a shelter for earthquake
victims to make room for a convention of plastic surgeons has
angered some of the displaced and brought an angry defense by Mayor
Art Agnos.
   Most of the 1,000 people housed in the Red Cross shelter at the
huge Moscone Convention Center were moved Sunday to the Presidio
army base and to a Navy transport ship, allowing time to prepare
for the American Society of Reconstructive and Plastic Surgeons'
convention Oct. 30, city officials said.
   The relocation angered residents of the Tenderloin district,
where hundreds of elderly and impoverished people were evicted from
damaged transient hotels after Tuesday's devastating 6.9-magnitude
quake.
   ``They should have the plastic surgeons postpone it for a week
and let people get over this earthquake. I'm still shaking from
this quake,'' said Keith Holyfield, 28, an unemployed man in a
stained shirt and tattered green-and-yellow Oakland Athletics' cap
who waited outside the Moscone Center on Sunday.
   The center is within walking distance of the Tenderloin's cheap
cafes. The Presidio and the USS Peleliu, at Pier 30, are miles
away, closer to the swanky Cliff House restaurant and Fisherman's
Wharf.
   The city's chronically homeless, the estimated 6,000 who live
year-round in doorways and warm themselves over garbage can fires,
said it took a disaster for the city to open an emergency shelter.
   ``Why does it take an earthquake for a bum to get a cup of
coffee?'' said Harvey Roberts, an unemployed accountant who has
slept at Moscone Center since the quake.
   ``The shelter, it's a luxury,'' said Holyfield, who slept on the
street until the quake raised his standard of living by making a
cot available in the convention hall ballroom.
   Mayor Art Agnos disputed the accusations that the city does not
normally provide adequate shelter. He said San Francisco already
pays for 2,900 hotel rooms a night and that the city needs
convention and tourist revenue to finance a new $17 million program
to create 3,000 additional dwellings for the poor within a year.
   ``This industry is the financial life blood of the city. We
won't have the money to pay for the permanent solutions,'' Agnos
said Sunday, as he headed into a quake-damaged City Hall closed to
the public.
   The hotel tax brings in $80 million a year. The tourist industry
is the city's largest single revenue source and employer, said Rudy
Nothenberg, San Francisco's chief administrative officer.
   Red Cross officials at the Moscone shelter, where 1,043 people
slept Saturday night, said the homeless had to be moved because the
center has no showers or working kitchen.
   ``It is a hot political issue. I can't fathom it,'' said Dave
Glaubinger, evening manager. ``It doesn't really conform to Red
Cross standards for a shelter.''
   The Rev. Cecil Williams, pastor of Glide Memorial Church in the
Tenderloin, where volunteers have served 5,000 meals a day since
the quake, denounced the proposed move in his Sunday sermon.
   ``I know that in a stress group that began Friday, the most
stressful thing they taked about was that they were going to be
removed,'' Williams said in an interview before the service.
   According to Williams' survey of hotels, 1,500 to 2,000 elderly,
disabled and poor residents were evicted when the city closed at
least five large transient hotels and parts of others after the
quake. Many of these were the same hotels where city government
provided nighttime shelter to the homeless.
   Eileen Maloney, a spokeswoman for Agnos, noted the different
treatment accorded Tenderloin homeless and the 1,000 people who
until Sunday were housed at the Marina Middle School in the
affluent district devastated by the quake.
   In one practice, dubbed ``red tagging,'' citizens offered
showers and beds to people who'd lost homes in the quake _ as long
as they could prove homelessness by showing a red tag, the official
notice allowing them to search their Marina apartments.
   ``What it means is that they're from the Marina,'' said Maloney,
visibly angry over the apparently discriminatory practice.
   Williams made a public appeal for every church in San Francisco
to take in 25 people, mainly mothers and children.
   ``It's time to rock the mother and the child in our bosom,'' he
said.
   Ann Burns, a Red Cross official, said buses began moving people
from the Moscone Center to the Presidio at midday. They expected
500 to 1,000 people to be relocated there.
   They will be housed in two buildings, one for the general
population, the second for families and the elderly.
   Single men will be housed on the ship.

<TEXT>
   The earthquake-crippled Bay area braced for
a gigantic traffic jam Monday, and officials appealed for commuters
to use car pools, trains or ferries, switch their hours or work
from home.
   ``Because of the stage of emergency ... if we find ourselves
with a single-person vehicle with any alternative, then they're
doing an anti-social act,'' said Rod Diridon, chairman of the
Metropolitan Transportation Commission, a regionwide planning
agency.
   Some 3 million people in the nine-county Bay area commute daily
on an average weekday, according to the commission which predicts 2
million of those will probably encounter delays of some kind.
Monday is the first real business day for many thousands since the
quake.
   At least 65,000 people who normally enter San Francisco over the
Bay Bridge at rush hour in cars or buses must find other routes
because the artery was severed.
   The Bay Area Rapid Transit system, which runs trains in a tube
beneath the bay, should pick up 35,000 of them and ferries can
handle 10,000. That leaves 20,000 to try car and van pools across
the San Mateo Bridge to the south or the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge
in the north.
   ``We expect it's going to be extremely crowded,'' said BART
spokesman Sy Mouber on Sunday. ``I would say that it's going to be
a jam-up probably.'' The system, which normally shuts from midnight
to 6 a.m., will run 24 hours.
   Transit officials urged businesses to implement ``flex hours,''
in which an employee can report to work at staggered times and
avoid commute rush-hours. They asked anyone able to work from home
to do that.
   The devastation to Northern California's roadways was
tremendous, and long-term.
   The eight-mile-long Bay Bridge will be closed at least a month
while a 50-foot section is replaced. Last Tuesday's 6.9-magnitude
earthquake also collapsed a 1.25-mile section of Interstate 880,
the Nimitz Freeway, killing dozens of people. It had carried
170,000 vehicles per day, but will now likely be closed for years.
   In San Francisco, the Embarcadero Freeway suffered severe
damage. The 1.2-mile elevated freeway, which connects downtown with
North Beach and Fisherman's Wharf, will be closed for months. So
will a five-mile stretch of Interstate 280 in San Francisco, from
U.S. Highway 101 to Sixth Street.
   In Santa Cruz, near the quake's epicenter, State Highway 17 was
closed because of landslides and mudslides. That important link for
20,000 people who commute to work in the Silicon Valley will be
closed to general traffic for an undetermined time, although one
line will be opened for buses and emergency vehicles.
   Ferry service around the Bay has been expanded, with added stops
at the Richmond Container Terminal and Jack London Square in
Oakland.
   Three ferries, capable of carrying at least 250 people each,
were supposed to arrive from Puget Sound in Washington by
Wednesday. But on Sunday, those boats were still docked because of
inclement weather.
   A ferry boat from San Diego and 20 small Navy vessels are
available to help transport commuters later in the week.

   Black leader Oscar Mpetha, one of
eight political prisoners freed from prison last week, said Sunday
that President F.W. de Klerk must ``wash the blood'' from his hands
before he will speak to him.
   Mpetha, 80, who was the nation's oldest political prisoner, also
called on de Klerk to free all political prisoners and legalize
opposition parties.
   Men, women and children huddled together under cold, gray skies
to listen to Mpetha, a one-legged, partially blind diabetic, who
remained seated throughout his speech.
   ``I can't speak to de Klerk. His hands are bloody,'' the African
National Congress leader told about 8,000 people at a stadium. ``He
must first wash the blood off his hands and feet.''
   Mpetha was the first of the freed prisoners to appear at a
public rally. He was sentenced to five years in prison in 1985
after being convicted of terrorism.
   ``Today is not just another day, not just aother rally. It is a
rally of the ANC, and we have come to welcome the ANC leadership,''
local civil rights lawyer Bulelani Ncuka told the crowd.
   Attorney Dulla Omar, regional chairman of the banned United
Democratic Front anti-apartheid movement, said the purpose of the
rally was to ``unban the ANC'' as well as to welcome Mpetha.
   The ANC, the main guerrilla group fighting the white-led
government, was banned in 1960.
   Mpetha, who says he still retains the title of president of the
ANC in the western Cape province, was flanked on the platform by
six elderly ANC men who were brought to the rally in an ambulance.
   Mpetha said a symbolic cleansing for de Klerk would involve
releasing all political prisoners, allowing exiles to return safely
to the country and legalizing the ANC.
   ``When he wipes his hands, this will be a sign,'' Mpetha said.
He also said that ANC leader Nelson Mandela must be freed to
address the people.
   ``Then only will I accompany Comrade Nelson Mandela and (ANC
President in exile) Comrade Oliver Tambo'' to talks with the
government, Mpetha said to resounding cheers.
   All the speakers stressed that the release of the eight
prisoners last week did not mean an end to the ANC's military
activity, and they called on the government to cease violence
through the army and police.
   De Klerk had said in a speech Saturday that all organizations
could be part of negotiations for an end to apartheid and the
inclusion of the black majority in national government if they were
committed to peaceful solutions.
   There was no visible police presence at the rally, except for a
helicopter that hovered briefly.

   A federation of Russian environmental, patriotic
and religious groups Sunday formed a federation to press for a
multiparty political system and the preservation of Russian
culture, a reporter said.
   The People's Front of Russia is similar to grass-roots political
organizations that first appeared in the Baltic republic of Estonia
in 1988. Other groups bearing similar names have been formed in
Latvia, Lithuania, Moldavia and the Ukraine.
   The organizations have been asserting the rights of indigenous
ethnic populations, which number more than 100 nationwide.
   The Russian group was formed after a two-day meeting in
Yaroslavl, a Volga River port northeast of Moscow.
   Viktor A. Khovrin, a reporter for the Yaroslavl newspaper
Northern Worker, said in a telephone interview that the more than
100 delegates adopted a platform calling for an end to the
Communist Party's monopoly on political power.
   Delegates from more than 40 cities throughout Russia also
pledged to work for development of Russian culture and language and
preservation of Russian historical monuments, he said.
   Russia has a population of about 147 million people.

   The parishioners of St. Francis de Sales
Cathedral were without a house of worship Sunday, their century-old
church tower filled with cracks and leaning precariously, but the
congregation's faith was unmoved. On Sunday, entry to the Catholic
church was barred by barbed wire fences and parishioners had to say
Mass down the street at a Baptist church.
   ``I need to cry. I need to let go,'' said Ona Solom, an acolyte
of the church. ``It's a heavy burden on the heart. But we're
grateful to come here.''
   ``A building is important,'' said the Rev. James Keeley. ``But
people _ they're more important.''
   As about 100 parishioners gathered for the service, some
automatically looked _ in vain _ for familiar seats.
   ``Sometimes in life, God shakes us and says `Pay attention,
there is something more important than the ordinary things in your
life,''' Father Joseph M. Powers told the worshipers.
   Religious groups in the San Francisco area were coordinating
activities after the earthquake, taking collections and enlisting
volunteers to help their congregations and other earthquake victims.
   A group of Protestant churches has started a counseling service
in which ministers will visit those who call feeling anxious.
   A Christian men's group meeting here Saturday set up sign-up
sheets for people who want to volunteer their skills to rebuild or
repair people's homes.
   ``We don't want to offer just prayers and comfort. We want to
offer something more. We want to help people any way they need
it,'' said the Rev. David Kiteley.
   In San Francisco, Roman Catholic Archbishop John R. Quinn led
700 worshipers at St. Mary's Cathedral in prayers for those who had
suffered in the earthquake.
   ``I weep for the parents, for the elderly, for the children,''
Quinn said. ``I pray for the relief of suffering and anxiety.''

<HEAD>Coleman, GOP Ticketmates Pick Up Richmond Times-Dispatch Endorsement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican J. Marshall Coleman won the
endorsement Sunday of the Richmond Times-Dispatch a week after his
opponent, Democrat L. Douglas Wilder, got the nod from The
Washington Post.
   Wilder, the state's 58-year-old lieutenant governor, is seeking
to become the first elected black governor in the country.
   In an editorial, the Times-Dispatch said it backed Coleman, 47,
based on ``his impressive experience as a state legislator and as
Virginia's attorney general, on the concept of government he
embraces and on the views he has expressed on vital issues during
this campaign.''
   Among other reasons, the newspaper said Coleman would strengthen
local authority over education, would deal sternly with drug lords
and other criminals, and would hold the line on taxes.
   The editorial also said the election of Coleman would protect
the state from ``a particularly nasty kind of political tyranny''
when the General Assembly, which has a Democratic majority, redraws
the state's legislative boundaries in 1991.
   The newspaper also endorsed Coleman's GOP ticketmates, Edwina P.
``Eddy'' Dalton for lieutenant governor and Joseph B. Benedetti for
attorney general.
   In its endorsement of Wilder last Sunday, the Post made no
comment on others on the ticket. Wilder's running mates are Donald
Beyer for lieutenant governor and incumbent Attorney General Mary
Sue Terry.

   The earthquake-delayed World Series will
not resume until Friday night, three days later than originally
hoped, baseball commissioner Fay Vincent announced Sunday.
   Games 3 and 4 and, if necessary, Game 5, will be played over the
weekend at Candlestick Park in San Francisco. Monday would be an
off-day, if needed, and Game 6 would be played Tuesday, Oct. 31,
and Game 7 on Wednesday, Nov. 1, in the Oakland Coliseum. The
American League's Oakland Athletics lead the Series, 2-0, against
the National League's San Francisco Giants.
   ``We have agreed that baseball should resume with enthusiasm
this coming week,'' Vincent said in a statement with Mayor Art
Agnos. ``But Tuesday was too ambitious.''
   The Series was interrupted last Tuesday night when an earthquake
shook the Bay area, 30 minutes before the start of Game 3 in
Candlestick Park. Baseball officials had hoped to resume play on
Tuesday, but Vincent and Agnos said the Bay area's priorities were
much more important than the World Series.
   Agnos said three major reasons for waiting until Friday are that
Candlestick Park must be certified safe, that the Bay area is able
to handle the traffic and that there will be enough security.

   Repairs to the San Francisco-Oakland Bay
Bridge began Sunday when a huge crane hefted half of the damaged
upper deck section off the lower roadway and smoothly lowered it
onto a barge 200 feet below.
   But today's task, just the beginning of work expected to take at
least a month, offers no relief to the gridlock expected when the
work week resumes Monday.
   It was unclear whether officials would try to remove a second
100-ton section of collapsed roadway Sunday or wait until Monday.
   Officials say it will cost up to $1 million to repair the
53-year-old bridge, damaged spectacularly in Tuesday's earthquake.
   Nationally broadcast pictures of the broken bridge, with the
upper deck dangling like an open trap door, provided the first
graphic illustration of the magnitude of the quake. One woman died
when she drove her car into the gap.
   The bridge had also been in the logo created for the 1989 World
Series between the San Francisco Giants and the Oakland Athletics
since it links the two cities. But its closure contributed to
Sunday's decision to delay resumption of the championship until
Friday, as officials attempt to reduce traffic problems.
   The 8.5-mile-long bridge carries 260,000 vehicles per day, and
the only alternatives are other jammed bridges, overloaded mass
transit systems and a makeshift fleet of ferry boats.
   The dangerous and painstaking task of lifting the heavy section
of roadway out of the damaged area and then lowering it to the
barge at bay level went without a hitch Sunday.
   ``Good planning,'' said state Department of Transportation
spokesman Jim Larson. ``It sounds like they made it look easy.''
   Also to be replaced is the section of lower roadway that took
the brunt of the impact when the upper level fell open.
   The lifting and lowering of the damaged section took only 20
minutes, and cables prevented the section from swaying in light
winds.
   The entire upper section measures 74 feet long and 50 feet wide
and weighs about 200 tons, said Lisa Murphy of the Transportation
Department. The numbers were modifications of previous
Transportation Department announcements.
   The section was cut in half by concrete saws and blow torches
beginning Saturday to make it easier to move, she said. State
officials hope they can repair and reinstall the upper span, she
said.
   Bill Schott, a Transportation Department engineer, said the
repairs should not cause any additional damage to the bridge. ``We
are doing nothing more than putting it back together the way it was
built in the first place,'' he said.
   Officials are urging commuters to use mass transit, car pools or
ferries while the bridge is closed, but everyone is predicting
traffic nightmares.
   ``Monday morning will be a zoo on traffic,'' said Bob Halligan
of the Transportation Department.

<DATELINE>WATSONVILLE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rosa Chavez has spent the nights
since the earthquake in the back of her father's truck with her
8-month-old baby and other family members.
   ``It's just scary. I think another disaster is going to
happen,'' said Chavez, 20. ``The little kids are afraid of going
into any building.''
   Four walls and a roof overhead no longer mean security in this
predominantly Hispanic community, where residents are mindful of
what happened in Mexico City four years ago. Thousands died in a
tremendous earthquake on Sept. 19, 1985, but many others were
killed by an aftershock the next day that trapped them inside their
homes.
   Now the only place many in Watsonville feel safe is among the
forgiving canvas walls of tents, and not even the driving rains
that have turned their campsites to mud have persuaded them into
shelters or back to homes that the city has declared safe to enter.
   ``The biggest problem we find is that they are families and the
children for the most part are frightened to death to go in
buildings,'' Mark Svennigsen, part of a team from San Mateo County
health services that is helping with relief efforts, said Saturday.
``They are willing to bear up under the cold and rain and
everything else to keep the children from screaming as they go into
houses,'' he said.
   Raymundo Leyva is one of those who fear another tremor could
topple the weakened walls of his house, killing anyone foolish
enough to be inside. The U.S. Geological Survey says there have
already been more than 2,000 aftershocks, with more expected in the
next few days that could cause additional damage.
   After Tuesday's quake, as soon as he could get to a working
telephone line, Leyva called his grandparents in Mexico who had
survived their own powerful earthquake.
   ``Everyone was crying. They said they were happy to hear from me
because they thought Watsonville was gone,'' Leyva said. ``They
thought it was going to happen, the same thing that happened in
Mexico City. I did, too.''
   Watsonville, located about 80 miles south of San Francisco, is
not gone, but uncounted homes and businesses are destroyed.
Amazingly, only one of the 30,000 residents was killed, the victim
of a bakery collapse.
   Volunteers estimate 500 people have been sleeping in the
half-dozen tent cities that have popped up in parks and empty lots,
all near areas where the damage has been especially severe.
   Many others are sleeping in their yards or cars rather than
enter homes whose foundations have shifted, porches have collapsed
or chimneys have caved in roofs.
   Three Red Cross shelters are already at capacity with 1,100
homeless who are willing to stay inside. On Sunday, the Red Cross
opened a full-blown shelter of olive drab military tents in Ramsey
Park, complete with medical and feeding facilities for those
sleeping on cots.
   ``It's unusual, but this was something we felt we had to do
because of peoples' concerns,'' said Red Cross spokeswoman Hope
Tuttle.
   The tent cities have become relief centers where volunteers from
throughout the region serve meals and coffee from the backs of
trucks. Donated clothes are piled under sheets of plastic and
anchored by scrap lumber.
   And the homeless, wearing garbage bags to stay dry, wait in long
lines for food, for tents and for diapers. They wait for anything
but a roof over their heads. Others, apparently without even a
tent, push shopping carts full of belongings through the streets.
   ``This place is a disaster,'' Pamela Cote, of the Santa Cruz
County human resources agency, said as she tried to coax 50
survivors living in Calaghan Park to move to 22 Army tents erected
several blocks away by the National Guard.
   ``People are everywhere on the streets in this town,'' Cote
said. ``A lot of this is cultural, they don't want to leave their
houses, they are afraid people are going to go in houses and take
things.''
   Even building inspectors' word that 363 homes have been checked
and are safe to enter hasn't appeared to sway many whose confidence
in even the ground beneath their feet was shaken by the 15-second
jolt.
   ``There's this distrust of government because a lot of people
are here illegally and they don't want to be turned in,'' Cote
said. ``We are giving services regardless. The INS is not going to
show up.''
   Federal Emergency Management Agency spokesman Bill Villa in San
Francisco said benefits would be provided to all victims regardless
of citizenship. ``There is no indication on the application whether
they are a citizen or not,'' he said. ``Disaster victims are
disaster victims.''
   City spokeswoman Lorraine Washington said no attempt will be
made to ban camping until all homes are inspected and it is
determined who was left truly homeless. Workers so far have marked
330 homes unsafe to enter near the hard-hit downtown area where
officials expect to raze an entire block of businesses, Washington
said. That total is expected to rise dramatically as workers travel
into the outskirts of town, she said.

<HEAD>Premier Sees Good in 1968 Reforms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROLAND PRINZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The premier of hard-line Czechoslovakia
said in remarks published Sunday that the reforms crushed by Soviet
troops in the 1968 invasion contained ``positive elements'' but
were wrong for the times.
   Premier Ladislav Adamec hinted that his country's leadership may
re-evaluate the Prague Spring reforms, which have been officially
scorned as a ``counterrevolution.''
   ``We have now a new generation that knows nothing about 1968 and
will view it with new eyes,'' he said.
   Adamec's comments came in interviews with Austrian journalists
in Prague. He was to arrive in Austria on Monday for an official
visit.
   While he spoke favorably of the 1968 reform program of disgraced
former leader Alexander Dubcek, Adamec also reaffirmed the
supremacy of the Communist Party in his country.
   In assessing the 1968 reforms, Adamec said: ``The action program
had a whole series of positive elements. ... I do not slander
Dubcek and the others.''
   He said Dubcek and his associates ``simply had no strength to
cope with the problems'' of the time. He did not elaborate in
quoted remarks in the Austrian reports.
   Adamec ruled out any challenge to Communist rule in
Czechoslovakia. ``Should criticism be geared to the liquidation of
the socialist system, we will not accept this,'' he said.
   Commenting on recent changes in East Germany, Adamec said
stability ``based on absolute obedience is not good.''
   He said the replacement of East German leader Erich Honecker, a
hard-line Communist ousted last week amid mass protests for reform,
``should have come earlier.''
   Adamec also said 70 East German refugees demanding permission to
go to the West via the West German mission in Prague ``have a
guarantee that they may emigrate.''
   While leaders of Hungary and Poland have been making democratic
reforms unprecedented in the Soviet-led East bloc, East Germany and
Czechoslovakia have resisted change.
   Hungarian Communists have dissolved their party and formed a new
one that professes democratic values, and Poland has formed a
government led by non-Communist labor leaders.
   On reforms in Hungary, Adamec said: ``The Hungarians can have as
many parties as they want. I admit, our Communist Party has also
made mistakes. But for that reason it is not necessary to liquidate
a party right away _ only because it has made mistakes.''
   Of Poland, he said: ``I was recently in Poland. I step off the
plane, and there is a strike in the whole city (of Warsaw). No
cars, no streetcars, the shops closed.
   ``The government chief has apologized: He has no beer, because
the strike has paralyzed transportation. Everything stands still.
Is that supposed to be an example for Czechoslovakia?''

   An air force fighter plane that was
performing air stunts crashed into a residential neighborhood on
the outskirts of this port city Sunday, killing nine people,
officials said.
   The plane destroyed four houses as it hurtled down into the
suburb of La Atarazana, near the air force base of Guayaquil, about
170 miles southwest of Quito, Red Cross official Eduardo Estrada
said.
   ``The bodies were awfully burned,'' he said.
   Among the dead was the pilot, Capt. Eduardo Arias, Estrada said.
The other victims, including two children, were area residents,
police said.
   No injuries were reported.
   The plane, a jet fighter, was an Israelite-made Kfir, according
to air force sources. Such a plane usually carries only one pilot,
the sources said on condition of anonymity.
   The air show was part of celebrations marking the anniversary of
Ecuador's air force. There was no immediate word on the cause of
the crash.

<HEAD>Eds: Leads with six grafs to UPDATE with comment from Miss Gabor;
white Rolls-Royce offered at last minute. Picks up 6th graf, `It's obviously...'.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rolls-Royce that Zsa Zsa Gabor was
driving when she got into an altercation with a motorcycle officer
failed to bring her minimum asking price of $125,000 when it was
unexpectedly offered at an auction.
   Miss Gabor said she had not intended to sell the white 1980
Corniche convertible, but was talked into it Saturday when she and
her husband visited the auction at a hotel in Woodland Hills where
another Rolls-Royce they owned went for $80,000.
   ``Nothing was arranged. But when we drove by, the auctioneer
said, `Would you like to sell that, too?' I said, `Only if you can
get me what I could get in Monaco,' '' Miss Gabor said in a
telephone interview Sunday.
   But the bids rose no higher than $105,000, offered by a Beverly
Hills car dealer. Miss Gabor drove off to Palm Springs, still in
possession of the car.
   ``I love that car,'' she said.
   The market rate for the Corniche is $70,000 to $80,000, said
Michael Fineman, a spokesman for Spectrum Auctions, whose firm
conducts occasional auctions for high-priced cars.
   ``It's obviously worth $105,000 to me because Zsa Zsa owned
it,'' said top bidder Michael Verdi.
   The Hungarian-born actress was driving the vehicle when she was
pulled over by Beverly Hills police Officer Paul Kramer last June.
She is to be sentenced Tuesday on her misdemeanor convictions of
slapping Kramer, driving without a valid license and carrying an
open container of liquor in her car.
   Miss Gabor had said she was determined to find a buyer because
she feared the Rolls would make her a target for police.
   ``I'm afraid to drive it in Beverly Hills now,'' Miss Gabor
said. ``I'm going to buy American cars from now on. You know the
new red Cadillacs? That's what I want.''
   Miss Gabor and her husband, Frederick von Anhalt, did sell a
cobalt blue, 1986 Rolls-Royce Silver Spur sedan for $80,000 to a
San Diego car dealer.
   Also up for grabs at the auction was a heavily customized,
metallic red Jaguar XJS that had earned its owner, outfielder Jose
Canseco of the Oakland Athletics baseball team, a string of
speeding tickets.
   The 12-cylinder car brought $75,000.

<TEXT>
   A fire that charred nearly 11,000
acres in three counties appeared tamed Sunday under a light rain,
but firefighters kept a wary eye out for flareups.
   ``If we didn't know anything about Southern California weather,
we'd say it was out and go home,'' Bruce Bundick of the U.S. Forest
Service said of the fire, which began Wednesday at this Marine base
and spread to the San Mateo Canyon wilderness area in the Cleveland
National Forest. It charred land in Orange, Riverside and San Diego
counties.
   ``You'd be hard-pressed to see anything even smoldering. But the
problem is, until you get a couple days' sun on it, you're not sure
where it's still hot,'' Bundick said. ``All it takes is one root or
one stump still smoldering that we don't notice, and the winds come
up, and it's off and running again.''
   The blaze, which had not advanced since Friday, was declared 65
percent contained on Sunday.
   No structures had burned. Some residents of the nearby Rancho
Carrillo housing tract in Riverside County temporarily evacuated
their homes as smoke and dust from the fire filled the air on
Friday, Bundick said.
   The rain has been both a hindrance and a help to the 900
firefighters on the line. Although it has helped keep the fire from
advancing, it has turned dirt roads in the area to mud.
   Three firefighters were injured, one with a dislocated shoulder,
another with a cut knee and a third who complained of chest pains,
Bundick said.

   Democratic National Committee Chairman Ron
Brown said Sunday he doesn't foresee a change in New Hampshire's
first-in-the-nation presidential primary.
   ``I think the impact of Iowa and New Hampshire has probably been
_ as far as the national outcome is concerned _ has probably been
grossly overestimated by political pundits,'' said Brown, in New
Hampshire to address about 200 Democratic leaders.
   ``Going first is good ... but I'm not sure that it has such a
profound impact over who the ultimate nominees of the party are
going to be,'' he said.
   Both the New Hampshire primary and the Iowa caucus to select
delegates are held in late February or early March and are the
first tests of presidential candidate strength.
   Brown said he does not advocate any radical changes in the
nominating process, which has been criticized by members of both
parties who say the two states have too much influence in
determining presidential candidates.
   However, he said it was good for other states _ such as
California, which is seeking to move its primary from June to March
_ to move up their primary dates if they are frustrated with how
the field of candidates has narrowed by the time they get to vote.
   Brown acknowledged the Republican dominance in New Hampshire _
the GOP holds all four congressional seats, the governor's office
and all five Executive Council seats _ but pledged the national
committee's support in helping get Democrats elected in 1990.
   Brown said the seat being vacated by Sen. Gordon Humphrey is a
good opportunity for Democrats, as they would not be running
against an incumbent. The 1st District seat in the House also will
be up for grabs because Rep. Bob Smith is running for the Senate.

   Cold air blanketed much of the eastern half of the nation
Sunday, with lows in the 30s as far south as Florida, and rain was
scattered across the Pacific Coast with a threat of snow in the
mountains.
   Tallahassee, Fla., cooled to a record 34 degrees and Melbourne,
Fla., had a record low of 49. Records were tied at Miami, with 59;
Fort Wayne, Ind., at 27; and Tampa, Fla., at 48.
   Freezing temperatures were reported in the Great Lakes region
and the northern Ohio Valley.
   Sunday's low for the Lower 48 states was not in the northern
Rockies as is common at this time of year but at Black River Falls,
Wis., at 22 degrees.
   By afternoon, temperatures were still in the 40s in northern New
England, but had warmed into the 70s across much of the central and
southeastern parts of the nation, into the 80s in Texas, and into
the 70s and 80s in the desert Southwest.
   Showers developing ahead of a cold front approaching the West
Coast were scattered up and down the coast, but no rainfall amounts
of as much as an inch were reported in the six hours up to 2 p.m.
EDT.
   The cold front was expected to produce snow at higher elevations
of northern California and Nevada on Monday. A winter storm watch
was posted for elevations above 7,000 feet in the Lake Tahoe area
of Nevada, and in northern California at higher elevations of the
northern Sierra Nevada north of Yosemite, and the Shasta and
Siskiyou mountains.
   Up to 3 feet of snow was possible in the Sierra Nevada, the
National Weather Service said.
   Dry weather prevailed across the rest of the nation.

   Authorities evacuated 100 to 150 people
Sunday from a housing project bordering an unstable but still
standing section of Interstate 880 because of fears that more of
the freeway could collapse.
   One portion of the Kirkham Court housing project is within 10
feet of a section of the damaged double-deck structure.
   If it fell unexpectedly, ``a tremendous amount of damage could
be done and people could get hurt,'' said California Department of
Transportation spokesman Kyle Nelson.
   Authorities expected the evacuation to last 24 hours.
   ``They'd rather be safe than sorry,'' said Oakland police Lt.
Kris Wraa.
   Four blocks of elevated freeway south of the 1\-mile stretch
that collapsed in Tuesday's earthquake, where cars and bodies still
remain buried, were closed Sunday because new cracks were found and
a concrete column fell.
   ``They just told us to get out. They didn't give us any time.
Now where am I going to go?'' Charles Baldwin, 22, said as he left
his apartment. ``I'm going to sleep in my car, that's where.''
   He said police told him Laurel Park Junior High School would
serve as an evacuation center.
   Nelson said extra contractors were being brought in to determine
if the road could be shored up in some way or if it would have to
be pulled down.
   Engineers on top of the freeway felt movement, and then found
the new additional stress fractures and fallen concrete.

   Syrian officials said Sunday they will
punish the pilots of two jet fighters accused of shooting down a
Turkish civilian airplane, killing all five crew members, a news
report said.
   Turkish and Syrian officials met in Turkey to investigate the
case, Turkey's semi-official Anatolia news agency reported.
   Turkish officials say two Syrian Mig-21 jet fighters flew 12
miles over Turkish territory Saturday to shoot down the civilian
airplane with missiles. They say all five crew members aboard were
killed.
   A Syrian official, Seyit Hasun, told reporters after the 4{-hour
meeting in the border town of Cilvegozu that the pilots would be
punished severely, Anatolia said. No further details were given.
   The dispatch quoted Hasun as saying the Syrians wanted to
conduct an on-site investigation. It did not say whether the
request was granted.
   The Syrian Foreign Ministry said Turkish Ambassador Erhan Turcel
met late Saturday with ministry officials and was told Syria had
set up a committee to investigate.
   The ministry asked Turcel to ``convey the condolences of the
Syrian government to the Turkish government and the families of the
victims in this painful incident.'' It gave no details on how the
plane was shot down or by whom.
   Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Murat Sungar said the
civilian aircraft was a small propeller plane doing geographical
survey work.
   Hanefi Demirkol, head of the Turkish delegation, told reporters
his group showed the Syrians evidence including empty shell cases
that showed the Turkish planes had been shot down by Syrian craft,
Anatolia reported.
   Demirkol said the evidence also included a tape of the Syrian
pilots' communication with their tower that showed the pilots
disregarded Turkish orders not to enter Turkish airspace.
   The pilots are heard on the tape telling their tower they ``hit
the target,'' Demirkol was quoted as saying.

   Two homemade bombs exploded in a
stadium during a soccer match Sunday and injured 14 people,
including two police officers, authorities said.
   A police spokesman said six people were arrested in connection
with the blasts.
   Earlier in the day, police had said 19 people were injured.
   The incident occurred during the first half of the match between
the teams Ajax Amsterdam and Feijenoord Rotterdam. The police
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said two explosive
devices were hurled from the Feijenoord sections of the grandstands.
   ``They looked like light fragmentation bombs, fireworks with
some scrap metal,'' the police spokesman said.
   Security was increased at the stadium last month after the
goalkeeper of an Austrian team was hit by a steel bar thrown from
the grandstands.
   It was not known how the explosive devices were smuggled in.
   After the explosions, police evacuated two sections of the
stadium. No further incidents were reported during the match, which
ended in a 1-1 draw.

<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl has assured
Poland that West Germany has no claims to its territory in comments
that pave the way for a summit Bonn hopes will end 50 years of
troubled relations.
   Nearly one-third of present-day Poland was part of Germany
before World War II. That land and the ethnic Germans living there
have continued to strain relations with Poland.
   However, Kohl has in recent months tried to ease tensions with
Poland, which Nazi Germany conquered 50 years ago. He has renounced
all territorial claims and pressed instead for improved conditions
for the ethnic German minority in Poland.
   On Saturday, the chancellor reiterated in a speech to West
Germany's Organization of German Exiles that ``the Federal Republic
of Germany raises no territorial or border claims'' against Poland.
   The organization includes survivors from among the 12 million
people driven from their homelands after World War II.
   In his speech, Kohl referred to the 1970 Treaty of Warsaw in
which West Germany recognizes the Oder-Neisse river boundaries as
Poland's western frontier. He said his government ``adheres to the
letter and spirit of the Warsaw Treaty in all its parts.''
   While Bonn clearly recognizes Poland's territorial integrity
under the treaty, some West German politicians say the agreement
would not commit a reunified Germany to its terms.
   Kohl plans an official visit to Poland on Nov. 9-14. He will
take with him a wide-ranging package of financial aid and political
agreements that he hopes will provide the basis for eventual
reconciliation with Poland.
   Despite the 1970 border agreement, West Germany and Poland did
not sign a peace treaty following World War II.

<DATELINE>TAIF, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Lebanese parliament on Sunday
passed a power-sharing accord intended to end the country's
14-year-old civil war, but Christian leader Gen. Michel Aoun
rejected the pact.
   Fifty-nine of 62 deputies present voted for the draft charter
but made their action contingent on approval by Aoun and his rival,
Moslem leader Salim Hoss. Two deputies abstained, and one voted
against the agreement.
   ``What the deputies approved in Taif is a crime I will not
accept,'' Aoun said at a news conference at the presidential palace
in suburban Baabda, east of Beirut.
   ``I have demanded a Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon, but they
came up with a peace plan full of ambiguities about this issue,
which constitutes Lebanon's sovereignty,'' Aoun said.
   His rejection put the future of the plan in doubt. There was no
immediate reaction from the Lebanese lawmakers, who retired
immediately after their late-night session. The Christian deputies
had consulted with Aoun by telephone before announcing they
intended to vote for the plan.
   Lebanon's lawmakers have been meeting in Saudi Arabia since
Sept. 30 under the auspices of the Arab League. The meeting abroad
was designed to remove them from scene of the fighting.
   Aoun said he could accept the political reforms in the proposed
accord, which would give more power to the Moslems, but ``the
deputies have actually exceeded their jurisdiction and
constitutional rights by voting in these ambiguities that
compromise Lebanon's sovereignty. I reject this plan and reject the
United States approval of it.''
   Aoun did not say what he meant by U.S. approval.
   In Washington, the White House declined to discuss the peace
plan. ``We're going to withhold comment until things are pinned
down a little bit more,'' a White House official said on condition
of anonymity.
   Aoun heads a Lebanese Christian government competing for
legitimacy with the predominately Moslem Cabinet headed by Hoss.
There was no immediate reaction from Hoss.
   Aoun also said that if the Syrians threaten to resume fierce
shelling that battered Beirut from March to September, his troops
were ready for battle.
   The general proposed putting the peace plan to a referendum of
the Lebanese people.
   ``If they support me, I shall lead them to achieve Lebanon's
sovereignty. Otherwise, I will reliquish authority,'' he said.
   As the parliamentary session began in Taif, Arab League envoy
Lakhdar Ibrahimi flew to Beirut for separate talks with Aoun and
Hoss.
   Despite Aoun's comments later, Ibrahimi told reporters he was
pleased there had been no new fighting in Beirut. He also said he
hoped ``the atmosphere of optimism and the steps that have begun
materializing will continue to ensure the interests of the Lebanese
people and end their plight.''
   The proposal falls short of Christian demands for a full pullout
of Syria's 40,000 troops in Lebanon within three years, but
includes Syrian proposals for at least a partial withdrawal. It
also guarantees an equal number of seats for Moslems and Christians
in the Parliament.
   There now are 33 Christian deputies and 30 Moslem deputies.
   The Parliament session, the first since Oct. 5, was called after
Saudi Arabia guaranteed it would be carried out, and the Christians
consulted with Aoun and said they had no reservations.
   ``We've reached final and comprehensive agreement,'' George
Saadeh, head of Lebanon's Christian Phalange Party, told The
Associated Press.
   When news of the agreement spread, the hotel where negotiations
were held flung open its banquet halls and served sharbat, the
sweet drink reserved for weddings and other special occasions.
   The deputies hugged and congratulated each other as they
gathered in the conference hall, with one absent due to heart
problems. Only 73 deputies of the last parliament elected in 1972
remain alive; 10 have boycotted the proceedings.
   Kazem Khalil, a Shiite Moslem deputy, said the deputies
``achieved a historic mission today for Lebanon and the Arab
world.''
   Under the peace plan, the first step in the Syrian withdrawal
would be to move Syrian troops out of a .6-mile _ or one-kilometer
_ radius around Parliament in Beirut before the legislative body
convened to ratify political changes and elect a new president.
   Lebanon has been without a president since September 1988, when
Amin Gemayel's term ended and legislators were unable to decide on
a successor.
   The plan, brokered by the Saudi foreign minister, Prince Saud
al-Faisal, calls for the Syrians to be replaced inside the
``security zone'' by Lebanese police backed by Algerian and
Moroccan observers, the sources said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The plan does not set a date for a final withdrawal of Syrian
troops from east Lebanon's Bekaa Valley _ a persistent Christian
demand.
   Instead of a fixed deadline for the Bekaa withdrawal, Syria
agreed that the issue be handled by a Syrian-Lebanese military
committee after political reforms are ratified, a president is
elected and a unified government formed.
   Moslems have argued that the Syrian presence is their only
guarantee political reforms will be carried out.
   Under the peace plan, Parliament would be increased to 108
seats, equally divided between Moslems and Christians. The
Parliament currently has 99 seats, and their had been disagreement
over proposals to increase it to 128 seats.
   When Lebanon received independence in 1943, the majority
Christians were given a 6-to-5 advantage over Moslems in all
government posts. Moslems now make up just more than 50 percent of
the nation's population.
   Sources said deputies asked Prince Saud for guarantees the plan
will be implemented. The sources said Prince Saud agreed to provide
a clarification or statement that would alleviate their concern.
   Syrian troops were sent into Lebanon in 1976 under an Arab
League mandate to quell the civil war.
   Aoun said the Syrian troops violated that mandate by siding with
Moslems in the war. He launched a ``war of liberation'' against
Syria in March.
   More than 900 people were killed and more than 2,000 wounded in
six months of savage shelling duels that ended with an Arab
League-sponsored cease-fire Sept. 22.

   Activists opposed to the Seabrook
nuclear plant in New Hampshire capped a week of protests by
demonstrating Sunday near the summer home of President Bush, even
though Bush was in the Washington area.
   ``We know he will get the message,'' said Kurt Ehrenberg, a
spokesman for the anti-nuclear Clamshell Alliance. Protesters in a
crowd estimated by police to be 125 to 150 waved flags and signs
and shouted anti-nuclear slogans.
   Organizers of the rally said they planned no civil disobedience
Sunday. Last Saturday, some 475 arrests were made as hundreds of
activists climbed the fence at the plant in Seabrook, N.H., so they
could be picked up for trespassing.
   Kennebunkport police Chief John Prescott said that the
protesters had caused no problems. Ehrenberg said that Prescott and
other local officials were cooperative as the demonstrators
arranged their rally.
   The plant, completed in 1986 and owned by a dozen utilities,
lacks a commercial operating license because of challenges to
evacuation plans for surrounding communities in Massachusetts and
New Hampshire.
   The fate of an operating license for Seabrook is pending with
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in Washington, but the opponents

   A Boeing 727 shook violently and
seemed to plunge just before it crashed in flames into a hillside,
killing 131 people, a badly burned survivor said Sunday.
   ``They told us to put on our seatbelts for landing, and then
suddenly the plane began to shake, like air turbulence,'' said
Evenor Lopez, a Honduran businessman.
   ``But it went on for a long time, and we seemed to be descending
too rapidly. Some people were screaming,'' Lopez said in an
interview.
   Investigators from the National Air Transportation Safety Board
arrived Sunday from the United States aboard a Coast Guard plane
and went directly to the site of Saturday's crash.
   The plane was operated by the Honduran airline TAN-SAHSA.
   Authorities said 131 of the 146 people aboard were killed. U.S.
Embassy spokesman Terry Kneebone said there were 15 Americans
aboard. Airline officials said three of the 15 survivors were
American.
   U.S. officials in Washington and Honduras issued partial lists
of fatalities with no hometowns or ages for many of the victims.
   They included: Gregory Paglia, a U.S. Marine stationed in
Nicaragua; Daniel Yurista, 37, Prairie Farms, Wis.; Eduardo
Apodaca, 49, San Luis Obispo, Calif.; Maria Esther Apodaca, 50, San
Luis Obispo, Calif.; Charles Friederich, Washington, D.C.; Robert
Hebb, 42, U.S. Agency for International Development employee;
Connie Montealegre, 68; Charles Kendall Morrow, Grandview, Mo.;
Michael O'Shea, Costa Rica; and Mary Weaver.
   U.S. embassy spokesman Mark Jacobs said he could not identify
other U.S. citizens until relatives were notified.
   The plane's ``black box'' recorder was flown to Washington for
analysis, said Barry Trotter, leader of the Safety Board team.
   TAN-SAHSA Flight 414 crashed Saturday morning on a hill 20 miles
south of Tegucigalpa while on a flight from San Jose, Costa Rica,
with a stop in Managua, Nicaragua.
   Maj. Alejandro Arguello, director of Nicaragua's civil
aeronautics, quoted regional air controllers as saying the roof of
the plane tore away before the crash.
   It was the worst air crash in Central American history. Among
the dead were the Honduran Minister of Labor, Armando Blanco
Paniagua; and Mario Rodriguez Cubero, an aide to Costa Rican
president Oscar Arias.
   ``I was asleep, and when I woke up we were on the ground,'' said
Rosario Ubeda Gonzalez, a 30-year-old Nicaraguan who runs a
restaurant in Shreveport, La., with her husband.
   ``I was buckled into my seat, and I heard some people helping
somebody behind me. Everything was on fire and I yelled, `Don't
leave me!'''
   Pilot Raul Argueta was one of the survivors. Doctors said all
were in stable condition.
   Two Americans, Kurt Shaeffer and Eugene Van Dyke, were evacuated
to U.S. hospitals. Jacobs identified Van Dyke as an employee of the
U.S. Agency for International Development in Tegucigalpa and said
he was taken to a burn center at Brooks Air Force Base in Texas.
   The hometowns of Shaeffer and Van Dyke were not available.
   The other U.S. survivor, Deborah Browning of Washington, D.C.,
was being treated for a broken ankle and burns.
   Hundreds of people gathered at Tegucigalpa's morgue Sunday as
doctors continued the slow task of identifying charred bodies.
Among them were relatives of Nicaraguan and Costa Rican passengers
who rushed to Tegucigalpa after receiving word of the crash.
   The cause of the crash was still not clear.
   Speculation centered on the plane's age, more than 20 years, and
on bad weather at Tegucigalpa's Toncontin airport.
   Lopez said that despite the turbulence, he thought the plane was
headed for a normal landing until the moment of the crash. He said
he couldn't see the ground because of the clouds.
   ``I was on fire when the plane stopped. I tell you, I thought I
was going to die. But I unbuckled my seat belt and I walked out of
the plane, it was all open,'' Lopez said.
   ``I put myself out with my hands and walked to a house I saw
about a block away,'' he said.

   Atlantis' astronauts went to bed
ahead of schedule Sunday night after Mission Control told them to
come home three hours early Monday to avoid high winds at the
Mojave Desert landing site.
   After spending the day stowing their gear, testing the shuttle's
steering system and packing up experiments, the five crew members
said good night to Mission Control shortly before 9 p.m. EDT _ 2{
hours earlier than planned.
   ``This will be our last time with you hopefully,'' said Mike
Baker, an astronaut serving as a spacecraft communicator at Mission
Control. ``You guys have done a superb job, and we'll see you
tomorrow back in Houston.''
   Atlantis Commander Don Williams thanked the flight control team
working Sunday night, the same crew that helped the astronauts
deploy the Galileo probe.
   ``I think we'll all, as the years pass and Galileo journeys
toward Jupiter, look back on this one as something that was
accomplished by a great team working together,'' Williams said.
   NASA earlier worked out a plan to land one orbit early but
decided after looking at the forecast Sunday to cut short the
five-day mission by two 90-minute orbits and land at Edwards Air
Force Base, Calif., at 9:33 a.m. PDT.
   Cable News Network was planning live coverage of the landing
Monday, and spokeswomen for CBS and NBC said the networks would
provide live coverage in the event of an unusual landing. ABC had
not finalized its plans as of late Sunday, said Julie Vecchione, an
ABC spokeswomen.
   The shuttle's main business _ sending the $1.5 billion Galileo
probe on its way to Jupiter _ was accomplished 6{ hours after
liftoff Wednesday. The craft operated flawlessly nearly 900,000
miles from Earth on Sunday, NASA said.
   In relaying the decision to return early, Mission Control
reported the Edwards forecast called for afternoon winds gusting to
35 mph, too high for shuttle safety rules, which limit crosswinds
to 18 mph and headwinds to 29 mph.
   At the new landing time, headwind gusts to no more than about 23
mph were forecast, flight director Ron Dittemore said Sunday.
Crosswinds are not a problem, because the astronauts have six
runways to choose from at Edwards.
   ``Everything looks real good,'' Dittemore said. ```The crew is
in fine shape. The orbiter is in good shape also, we're not working
any problems. (We're) just looking at the weather tomorrow at
Edwards, and we don't expect a problem there either.''
   Asked in a news conference from space if the winds concerned
him, Williams replied, ``We have no concern about flying it right
out to those limits because we know it's been done before and it's
been done safely.''
   Williams, who flew on a shuttle mission in 1985, described what
re-entry through the atmosphere will be like in the interview with
Cable News Network.
   ``Re-entry heating is rather spectacular if you see it in the
darkness. ... It looks like you're inside a fire looking out,'' he
said.
   Another crew member, Franklin Chang-Diaz, spoke of the Galileo
probe sent on a six-year, 2.4-billion-mile voyage to explore the
colossus of the solar system.
   ``We all certainly breathed a sigh of relief when it went
according to plan and we kept hearing all the good news from the
ground that the spacecraft had done all the things that it had to
do to get on its way,'' he said.
   To get ready for the return home, Williams and pilot Mike
McCulley tested Atlantis' flight control systems and fired one of
its steering thrusters. They reported all ready to support the
fiery dash through the atmosphere and landing.
   Mission specialists Ellen Baker, Shannon Lucid and Chang-Diaz
began packing up materials processing, medical, plant growth and
other experiments and stowing cameras and other gear.
   To adjust their body clocks to the earlier landing, the crew
went to bed 90 minutes early on Saturday and 2{ hours earlier
Sunday.

   Finance Minister Shimon Peres was temporarily
moved to an intensive care unit at a hospital in northern Israel
after suffering a relapse during recovery from a urinary tract
infection, doctors said Sunday.
   They refused to say when Peres, also the Labor Party leader and
vice premier, could be released from the hospital.
   However, an aide to Peres, who visited him Sunday night and
later spoke on condition of anonymity, said the 66-year-old leader
was in good condition and meeting with staff at his bedside.
   Doctors at Haemek hospital in the northern town of Afula first
announced Sunday that Peres was moved to the intensive care unit
Thursday night because of worries the urinary tract infection had
damaged vital organs. They said the infection had entered his blood
stream and that he was transferred to undergo tests with more
sophisticated equipment.
   Peres cut short a trip to northern Israel and was rushed to the
hospital Tuesday after complaining of feeling ill.
   Doctors diagnosed then infection and originally predicted his
release in 48 hours.
   ``His medical condition is satisfactory,'' Udi Pantor, deputy
director of Haemek hospital, said Sunday on Israel television. ``It
is true that his recovery seems slow, but it is not slow for
someone who is acquainted with the disease.''
   Doctors gave no other details on his condition.

<TEXT>
   The formal search for DC-10 engine parts ended
with new discoveries Sunday and investigators said they expect
farmers to find more pieces of the disabled jetliner along the
flight path in northwest Iowa.
   The jumbo jet, which lost its hydraulic flight controls July 19
in the breakup of its tail-mounted engine north of Alta, crashed in
flames in an attempted landing at Sioux City, killing 112 of the
296 people aboard.
   Volunteers using metal detectors Sunday found a fragment of a
fan blade from the No. 2 engine of Flight 232 and a piece of a
track for engine ball bearings, said Jerry Clark, a flight safety
investigator for General Electric Aircraft Engines. On Saturday,
search parties north of Alta found two blade retainers that were
part of the engine rotors and a part of the hydraulic pump.
   Such discoveries help investigators ``tell the story of the
chain of events in the failure,'' Clark said.
   But one key part still was missing as volunteers from metal
detector clubs returned to their homes in Iowa and surrounding
states.
   The searchers did not locate a flange that connected the forward
fan shaft to the disc in the aft engine. Of the engine pieces still
missing, Clark said the flange is the ``thing most important'' to
investigators.
   While GE ended the formal search, Clark said he expected parts
to come in from farmers who have yet to complete their field work.
   ``There's one square mile yet to be harvested along the primary
path of fragments we've found,'' he said Sunday night.
   Along with the airplane debris, searchers also found artifacts
from more than a century of farming and rural living.
   Konny Droegmiller said Sunday that the sleigh bells, spiked
horse shoes and a sledge hammer won't help solve the mystery of the
crash of Flight 232, but that she's glad to have them.
   ``The biggest thing for me was an old brass sleigh bell that
still rings,'' she said. ``And there's not any rust on it. Now who
knows how long that had been out there,'' she said.
   The search, paid for by GE, followed a hunt by more than 100
members of metal detector clubs last weekend.
   The biggest reward this weekend was the $1,000 paid Sunday for
the discovery of a set of ``mid-span shrouds for a fan blade.''
   GE offered more than $270,000 in rewards for various parts.
   The largest single award of $119,000 was claimed this month when
Droegmiller's neighbor, farmer Janice Sorenson, found most of the
rear engine fan disc. The rest of the disc was found on the nearby
farm of Harold Halverson, who received about $40,000.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Sunday he is
not stalling the Middle East peace process, and his aides said
Israeli and U.S. officials are holding intense negotiations on
future talks.
   Shamir's statements came amid reports from Washington that U.S.
Secretary of State James A. Baker III is disillusioned over the
slow pace of negotiations and may soon focus more attention on
other world problems.
   In the occupied West Bank, soldiers shot and killed a
16-year-old girl in a clash with stone-throwing youths, Arab
hospital officials said.
   An army spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
confirmed that troops opened fire on stone-throwers in the West
Bank village of Bala. He said said the military was investigating
hospital reports that the teen-ager, identified as Sana Abu Zeina,
was killed by the gunfire.
   Also Sunday, Sami Abu Laila, 18, of the West Bank town of Nablus
died of wounds suffered in a Saturday clash with troops, hospital
officials said.
   The latest deaths raised to 600 the number of Palestinians
killed by Israeli troops or civilians in the 22-month uprising
against Israeli occupation. Forty Israelis also have been slain.
   On Sunday, an Israeli driving near the occupied Gaza Strip was
seriously wounded in the head in a stone-throwing incident.
   In an address to activists in his right-wing Likud bloc, Shamir
said: ``I asked the president of the United States not to pay
attention to those that insinuate that I am running away from the
peace initiative.''
   ``I'll say it now, and I'll say it 1,000 times,'' Shamir said.
``That is a lie because the Likud and I within it are for a true
peace that will serve our security and interests.'' He was speaking
at a rally in the southern port city of Ashdod, 25 miles south of
Tel Aviv.
   Shamir telephoned Bush on Tuesday night to discuss the peace
process.
   The U.S.-Israeli contacts were reported as Shamir's governing
partners in the left-of-center Labor Party threatened to support a
parliamentary motion to topple the coalition Cabinet unless he
showed more flexibility with the Americans.
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens joined Shamir in urging U.S.
officials not to be frustrated with the pace of talks. He, too,
said Israel was aggressively pursuing negotiations.
   ``I think that Mr. Baker also realizes that advancing peace in
the Middle East requires patience,'' Arens said on Israel
television's Arabic language service.
   Shamir adviser Avi Pazner denied reports that U.S. efforts to
arrange preliminary talks between Israeli and Palestinian
representatives had broken down in disagreement over who the Arab
negotiators would be.
   ``This is not true. We are at the height of negotiations with
the Americans,'' Pazner said in a telephone interview.
   His comments follow an exchange of public criticism between
Israeli and U.S. officials, started by Shamir's declaration last
week that he could not be pressured by Washington to enter talks
with Palestinians.
   Israel so far has dismissed efforts by Baker to arrange a
meeting with Palestinians on Israel's stalled proposal for
elections in the occupied territories.
   Israeli officials say Baker's plan for a meeting with a
Palestinian delegation would leave open a role for the Palestine
Liberation Organization, which Israel views as a terrorist group.
   PLO chief Yasser Arafat arrived Sunday in Cairo for talks with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Arafat, in remarks reported by
the Middle East News Agency, described Shamir as ``Mr. No.''
   The PLO Central Council also has rejected the American and
Israeli proposals, saying they are designed to impose Israel's
election plan on the Palestinians.
   Pazner denied reports in Israeli newspapers Sunday that Baker is
pushing Shamir for a quick reply to his proposals.
   Israel's initiative, introduced in April, calls for elections
among the 1.7 million Palestinians in the occupied lands to choose
representatives for peace talks with Israel on interim self-rule.
The final status of the territories would be decided in later talks.

   It was a battle of two chess champions _ one
active and outspoken, known to sip tonic water during matches, the
other sitting quietly on a desk, taking in a different kind of
juice.
   World chess champion Garri Kasparov, who hasn't lost a
tournament since 1981, met Deep Thought, the winner of this year's
World Computer Chess Championship, for two games Sunday. The human
won both games.
   ``I'm very happy I could do in both games what I wanted,''
Kasparov said. ``In the first game, with black, I played quietly.
In the second game, I tried to crush it in the opening.''
   The computer retired from the first game after Kasparov's 52nd
move and 2{ hours of play. After that victory, Kasparov said: ``I
expected it. It's a good player but without position and
experience.''
   Playing white in the second game, Kasparov took Deep Thought's
queen in move 18. The computer hung on; surrendering after 37 moves
and 2 hours.
   ``I think the computer needs to be taught something _ how to
resign,'' said the 26-year-old Soviet.
   Kasparov said after the first game he realized early on that he
would win when the computer missed some tactical opportunities and
was not able to analyze all of the champion's decisions.
   ``I don't mind who's sitting opposite me,'' said Kasparov, who
lives in the Soviet city of Baku, in Azerbaijan. ``If a computer
should win, of course, I would have to challenge it to protect the
human race.''
   Murray Campbell, who helped create the computer program at
Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh, said it appeared there
was a bug in the computer during the matches.
   ``It wasn't looking at the right moves,'' he said. ``It wasn't
given a chance to show its best style of play.''
   Chess commentator Shelby Lyman, who helped arrange the match,
said before the games that Deep Thought was ``clearly the first
chess computer with the potential to draw blood and defeat the
world champion.''
   Lyman predicted the computer would make moves Kasparov might not
expect.
   But it was Kasparov's moves that caught the computer by surprise.
   One of several hundred spectators, chess grand master Larry
Christiansen, complained that computers are ``killing the
creativity of chess. A lot of the beauty of chess is coming up with
an original and beautiful idea. Now, with computers, everything is
known.''
   Nine-year-old Conrad de Marez Oyens disagreed. He has been
playing against computers for three years _ and prefers them to
human counterparts.
   ``When you play it, it's always a good game, even if you lose,''
he said, predicting that human chess skills will improve because of
computers.
   Deep Thought, created by five graduate students at
Carnegie-Mellon, can analyze possible 700,000 positions on the
chessboard per second and five to 20 moves ahead by each side, as
well as discern each move's implications.
   Deep Thought evaluates the millions of possible board positions
created by each sequence of five moves it imagines. It assigns a
numerical value to the positions created by each sequence, and
moves toward positions with the highest values.
   The computer didn't even have to travel for the match; it
remained in Pittsburgh with a telephone line to relay its moves to
a computer terminal in New York, where someone moved the chess
pieces on a board.
   Feng-Hsiung Hsu, who designed the computer's silicon guts, said
he wouldn't call it intelligent. ``It's just mathematical
applications. When humans play chess, they use their intelligence.
When machines play chess, they do calculations.''
   Kasparov said the computer was ``fully aggressive'' but that its
``mind was too straight and too primitive.''
   ``Chess is much wider than just calculations. It's even wider
than logic. You have to use fantasy, intuition and some kind of
prediction,'' Kasparov said.
   But he said the computer does have some advantages: ``We can
lose hope. A computer can't lose hope.''
   ``One of the main goals of the match is to learn something about
Deep Thought,'' said Campbell, who wrote the computer program with
Feng-Hsiung Hsu.
   Campbell said he would study the games with Kasparov and
possibly rewrite the program to make Deep Thought better.
   Last November, Deep Thought beat Denmark's Bent Larsen _ the
first time a computer had defeated a grandmaster in tournament
play. Larsen is the world's 96th-ranked player, with an
International Chess Federation rating of 2,580 based on his
tournament performances.
   In comparison, the computer's rating from the United States
Chess Federation is 2,250; the International Chess Federation put
Kasparov at 2,775. A beginner typically would rank about 1,200.
   Deep Thought captured the 1989 World Computer Chess Championship
in Edmonton, Canada.
   Kasparov became a grandmaster 10 years ago and captured the
world championship in 1985.
   The match at the New York Academy of Art was part of an annual
chess competition sponsored by ASG Computers Inc. Kasparov was paid
an undisclosed amount to participate.

   Whittle Communications is planning a
Spanish-language magazine and a series of daily two-minute
television programs designed to reach the fast-growing U.S.
Hispanic population.
   The project, which will be launched in the spring of 1990,
represents the Knoxville, Tenn.-based media company's first effort
to reach the Hispanic market, which the Census Bureau recently said
has surpassed 20 million people.
   It comes as a number of major advertisers including Coca-Cola
Co., PepsiCo Inc. and Burger King Corp. have launched ad campaigns
to reach Hispanics.
   According to Hispanic Business Magazine, national advertisers
spent more than $550 million on reaching this market last year, up
12 percent from 1987.
   Whittle plans to sell advertising in both the magazine and the
TV program in a package and is asking sponsors to make two-year
commitments.
   Peter Finn, the Whittle executive who has overseen development
of the project, said all but ``a couple'' of 20 available
advertising units have been sold out for the first two years at an
annual price of $500,000 per unit.
   He declined to identify any of the sponsors but said the
consumer products giant Procter &amp; Gamble Co., which has been the
leading advertiser to Hispanics, had underwritten development of
the project.
   The magazine and TV programs will be designed to provide useful
information on practical concerns such as family health, nutrition,
parenting, financial management and education, he said.
   ``What's out there now is very much entertainment and
celebrity-driven editorial,'' Finn said.
   The magazine, which will be published once every two months,
will be called ``La Familia de Hoy,'' or ``Today's Family.''
   It will be distributed at 10,500 locations with large Hispanic
clienteles, including doctors' and dentists' offices, hospitals,
clinics and beauty salons. Four copies will be left at each site
for reading while waiting.
   In addition, subscriptions will be available at a price to be
determined later and tests will be made on newsstand sales and
distribution through grocery stores in Hispanic neighborhoods.
   Each issue is to be 56 pages long with 20 pages of advertising.
As with another Whittle magazine project called Special Reports
that is distributed in doctors' waiting rooms, advertisers will be
guaranteed exclusivity in their product categories.
   But advertisers in this magazine will get a chance to be on
Spanish-language television as well.
   Whittle plans to produce a series of two-minute informational
features that are to air seven days a week on Univision, the
nation's largest Spanish-language TV network that reaches an
estimated 85 percent of the estimated 6 million Hispanic
households. It claims a weekly viewing audience of 14 million.
   Finn said each of the two-minute features, many of which will be
video versions of topics covered in the magazine, would include a
30-second commercial.
   The features will be run five times a day during the week on the
Univision network and three times a day on weekends.
   Whittle is paying Univision an undisclosed amount for the time,
and will provide other considerations, such as promotion in the
magazine.

   A 21-member panel of educators has been named to
advise on the content of the Channel One daily news show for use in
the classroom that debuts next spring, Whittle Communications
announced Sunday.
   The Channel One program has provoked considerable controversy
since it was tested in six schools last spring because each
12-minute show contains two minutes of paid pitches for products
ranging from candy bars to acne medicine.
   Critics say it is wrong to allow advertisers to peddle their
wares to a captive audience of students in school.
   But the Knoxville, Tenn.-based Whittle has been recruiting
schools for the national rollout of the show next spring, offering
to install thousands of dollars worth of TV monitors, videocassette
recorders and satellite dishes in exchange for a promise to show
the program in class every day.
   It has touted the program as a way to keep students informed
about current events, and has encouraged teachers to develop lesson
plans from the new stories that it covers.
   ``This board will play a critical role in ensuring that the
Channel One programming and support materials for the schools meet
high and rigorous educational standards,'' said William S.
Rukeyser, editor-in-chief of Whittle Communications, which is based
in Knoxville, Tenn.
   The board is expected to meet three or four times a year.
   Panel members are: Jay Sommer, New Rochelle, N.Y., foreign
language teacher and former National Teacher of the Year; Iris
Carl, Houston, math teacher; Joseph Feinstein, Los Angeles, TV host
and producer; Patrick Daly, Detroit, National Federation of
Teachers executive; Ben Ebersole, Hershey, Pa., school
administrator.
   Jane Oates-Lichman, Philadelphia, special education teacher;
John Arevalo, San Antonio, Texas, history teacher; Joel Fink,
Buckner, Ky., guidance counselor; Elaine Mosley, Chicago, head of a
privately funded inner city school project; Damon Moore, Muncie,
Ind., former head of Indiana State Teachers Association.
   Eunice Askov, State College, Pa., director of Institute for the
Study of Adult Literacy at Penn State; Tom Sedgwick, Tacoma, Wash.,
math teacher; Betty Berry, Knoxville, Tenn., head of science
department at Central High School in Knoxville, one of the Channel
One test schools; Anne Ferguson, Coeur D'Alene, Idaho,
communications teacher.
   Gerald Katz, Washington, D.C., executive director of the
National Energy Education Development Project; Robin Oden, Detroit,
principal of Mumford High School, a Channel One test school; Pat
Scales, Greenville, S.C., librarian.
   Susan Kaplan, Providence, R.I., English teacher; Elizabeth
Johns, Alexandria, Va., college administrator; N.B. Martin,
Visalia, Calif., retired professor; and Terry Wyatt, Toledo, Ohio,
physics teacher.

   The Rev. Jesse Jackson told striking Boeing Co.
workers not to give up and a union van in Wichita, Kan., was hit by
gunfire over the weekend as the walkout entered its 20th day Monday
with no new talks scheduled.
   The strike by nearly 60,000 Machinists began Oct. 4. A
negotiating session called by federal mediator Douglas Hammond
ended Wednesday after just four hours.
   Boeing chairman Frank Shrontz was to speak Monday to a group of
Seattle media and business leaders on ``The Boeing Strike: The
Inside Story.''
   Under ground rules for the appearance before the Seattle Chamber
of Commerce Community Development Roundtable, the meeting was to be
closed and none of the comments published, officials said.
   To counter the session, the Washington State Labor Council and
Machinists union set their own briefing on the strike. Tom Baker,
president of Machinists District Lodge 751, was to talk to labor
leaders and reporters at the same time as Shrontz's speech.
   In Wichita, site of a large Boeing plant, two men and a woman
were arrested Saturday after a van outside the union's strike
headquarters was sprayed by shotgun pellets. No one was injured and
the three were released on bond pending court action.
   Witnesses said several blasts were fired from a passing car at
about 2 a.m. Saturday, striking the van, the building, parked
vehicles and a neon sign, said Harold Stocking, shift strike
captain at the Machinists' Aero Lodge 834. The incident occurred as
vans were preparing to take pickets to their posts.
   Meanwhile, Jackson told 5,000 Machinists who marched on
Saturday: ``When these strikes get long, don't give up. You must
stand together for fairness and dignity.''
   The marchers carried plastic bag-covered picket signs, balloons
and umbrellas in the rainy weather.
   ``Boeing is number one because its workers are number one,''
Jackson said at a rally following the march.
   Baker told the crowd it's time for Boeing to provide its workers
with better health care benefits and with child care provisions.
   ``No new planes can be built without you,'' said Justin Ostrow,
Machinists International vice president. ``And no new planes will
be built without you.''
   Machinists voted overwhelmingly to strike rather than take a
three-year contract with wage increases of 4 percent, 3 percent and
3 percent. The company also offered bonuses of 8 percent of gross
pay in the first year and 3 percent the second; cost-of-living
boosts virtually matching inflation; a 20 percent cut in mandatory
overtime; and higher benefits.
   Machinists represent about 57,800 Boeing workers nationwide,
including 43,300 in the Puget Sound area, 12,000 in Wichita, Kan.,
1,700 in Portland, Ore., and a few hundred others at scattered
sites in California, Hawaii, Montana, Utah and other states. Boeing
has a total 164,000 workers worldwide and 106,000 in Washington
state.
