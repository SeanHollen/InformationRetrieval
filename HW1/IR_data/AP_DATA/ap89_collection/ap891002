<HEAD>Norway Coalition Agrees To Topple Labor Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three opposition parties agreed on a basic
platform for a new non-socialist coalition and stand ready to
topple the minority government of Prime Minister Gro Harlem
Brundtland, an opposition leader said Monday.
   The emerging coalition was expected to submit a no-confidence
motion in Parliament this month if Mrs. Brundtland refuses to
resign, the national news agency NTB said.
   Conservative Party chairman Jan P. Syse, who probably would
become prime minister under the new coalition's plan, declined to
reveal details of its platform until the three parliamentary groups
review and approve the recommended policies.
   ``Lots of work remains to be done, including distribution of
ministerial posts,'' Syse said on national NRK radio.
   The alliance of Conservative, Christian Democratic and Center
parties won a total of 62 seats in the 165-seat parliament in Sept.
11 elections. Mrs. Brundtland's Labor party won 63 seats, and the
Socialist Left Party, allied with Labor, won 17.
   There was one independent.
   The right-wing Party of Progress, with 22 seats, held the
balance of power. Its chairman, Carl I. Hagen, says he would
support a no-confidence vote against Mrs. Brundtland, but would not
pledge future loyalty to the new coalition unless his party became
a full partner.
   ``We are ready to present such a no-confidence motion, if
necessary,'' Syse said in a radio interview.
   Mrs. Brundtland told Labor's central board on Sunday she will
decide the future of her government only after seeing the
opposition's platform.
   The three non-socialist leaders demanded she resign as early as
possible ``in order not to delay the coalition's and the
Parliament's work,'' NTB reported.
   ``She can chose to step down after Labor has presented its 1990
state budget proposal to the parliament on Oct. 12, or she risks
being toppled by a general no-confidence vote on Oct. 24,'' the
agency said.

<HEAD>Former SMU president Willis Tate Dead at 77</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Willis M. Tate, who served as president of
Southern Methodist University for nearly 20 years, died of an
apparent heart attack while on a trip with his wife in Colorado,
the school announced Monday. He was 77.
   Tate, who died Sunday night, was the university's president from
1954 to 1971 and again from July 1974 to October 1975. He retired
as chancellor in 1976 and since then had served as president
emeritus of SMU.
   Tate was an all-conference tackle and an honorable mention
All-American in 1931, when SMU won the Southwest Conference
football championship.
   He received his bachelor degree of arts in 1932 and his master's
of arts in sociology in 1935, both from SMU. After serving as
teacher and school principal in San Antonio, Tate returned to SMU
in 1945 as assistant dean of students.
   ``He will be remembered as the protector of academic freedom
during the difficult times in the 1950s and 1960s and as a strong
supporter of curriculum reforms,'' said SMU President A. Kenneth
Pye.
   Tate also presided over the establishment of SMU's School of the
Arts and the launching of doctoral programs on campus.
   He and his wife, the late Joel Estes Tate, had two children.
Tate is survived by Marian Cleary Tate, whom he married in 1988,
his two children and three grandchildren.

<HEAD>Elvis Presley Haunts Jim Jarmusch's New Movie</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Elvis Presley's involvement in the plot of Jim
Jarmusch's new movie, ``Mystery Train,'' was a mystery to the
filmmaker.
   The writer-director of ``Stranger Than Paradise'' and ``Down by
Law'' says he started with a few characters, like he always does,
and came up with the idea for shooting the movie in Memphis, Tenn.,
home of Presley's Graceland mansion and Sun Studios, where ``The
King'' first recorded.
   ``He snuck in there; you got to watch out for him,'' said the
director at a recent press conference after the film's preview at
the New York Film Festival.
   ``When I first came to Memphis I went to Graceland immediately.
By the time I left Memphis, I was so sick of Elvis I never wanted
to hear about him again.''
   But for now, questions about Jarmusch and Presley are
unavoidable.
   Elvis is everywhere in ``Mystery Train,'' named after an old
blues song that Presley recorded at Sun. His music is on the
soundtrack, his pictures hang in hotel rooms, characters see his
ghost and Johnny, a working-class Englishman played by rock 'n'
roller Joe Strummer, is even nicknamed ``Elvis.''
   ``Mystery Train'' is broken into three segments, which take
place in the same time frame: A young Japanese couple visit Memphis
to see Graceland and Sun; a young Italian woman, recently widowed,
and a talkative stranger share a hotel room for one night; and
three buddies are forced to leave town when Johnny kills a liquor
store clerk.
   ``The Japanese couple are fans, they're kind of an audience,''
Jarmusch says. ``As the story progesses, the way Elvis is treated
changes somwewhat. By the third story, Johnny's saying, `That guy
is everywhere.'''
   Fans of Jarmusch's earlier films will quickly recognize the
director's dark humor and fondness for characters usually found
only in barrooms and poolhalls. ``Mystery Train'' is, however,
Jarmusch's first movie shot in color.
   ``I have to write very visually,'' he said. ``When I start to
visualize the film, I make an intuitive decision and I stick to
that. I can't say why. If you ask someone whether they dream in
black and white or color, they can't say why. ``I have future
projects and I already know that some are color and some are black
and white.''
   Jarmusch did say he will continue to make low-budget films
outside the Hollywood studio system. He recalled a conversation
with producer Dino DeLaurentiis.
   ``He asked me, `Why do you make amateur films instead of
professional ones?' I asked what made a film amateur or
professional. He said any film that costs more than $5 million is
professional.
   ``I guess I'm still making amateur films.''
   The cast includes Elizabeth Bracco, Rick Aviles, Nicolette
Braschi and rhythm 'n' blues stars Screamin' Jay Hawkins and Rufus
Thomas.
   ``Mystery Train'' is scheduled for a mid-November release by
Orion Classics.

<TEXT>
   Strip away the orange ribbons, and
Pulaski's courthouse square could be a movie set for an archetypal
Southern town, where a Confederate hero stands on a pedestal and
pickup trucks sport Dixie flags.
   But the orange ``brotherhood color'' affixed to storefronts,
lampposts, car antennas and coat lapels is meant to make sure no
one confuses Pulaski residents with the white supremacists who plan
to march through town Saturday.
   ``These people are outsiders and this county is a victim of rape
by these groups,'' said author Gregory Mcdonald, who owns a farm in
the area and helped organize the anti-march campaign.
   Restaurants, stores and markets have agreed to close for the day
throughout the town of about 8,000 people 90 miles south of
Nashville. Residents have been asked to stay off the streets, and
churches have planned activities to keep children and teen-agers
away from downtown.
   The racists are attracted to Pulaski by the town's role in the
history of the Ku Klux Klan. The group was founded in Pulaski in
1865 as a reaction to what community leaders saw as a threat by
carpetbaggers and former slaves after the Civil War.
   It was disbanded four years later after the Legislature passed
an anti-Klan law. The modern Klan was formed outside Atlanta in
1915 by a former minister who added Jews and Catholics to the
group's list of enemies.
   The Klan began marching in Pulaski annually in 1986 to protest
the Martin Luther King national holiday.
   The parades typically draw fewer than 100 marchers. Community
leaders say as long as the racists obtain the proper permits and
follow other rules they can't be stopped.
   ``It started out as 35 to 40 old boys putting on their bed
sheets and marching around the square haranguing,'' said Mcdonald,
author of the ``Fletch'' mystery novels. ``These people considered
the town's silence tacit approval. Nothing could be further from
the truth.''
   Town leaders decided it was time to act when the Aryan Nations
of Hayden Lake, Idaho, announced plans to march here this year.
   The group advocates the formation of a whites-only country. Ten
members of an Aryan Nations splinter group were convicted of
racketeering in 1985 in a plot to overthrow the U.S. government
that involved murder, bank robbery and armed confrontations.
   ``We're just not going to let our town be taken over by bigots
and hate mongers,'' said Bettie Higgins, director of the Chamber of
Commerce.
   Both sides claim Pulaski's Civil War hero, Sam Davis, a
21-year-old Confederate scout who was hanged after refusing to
reveal the name of a Rebel spy. Ms. Higgins helped wire an orange
wreath to the hands of a statue of Davis on the town square. The
white supremacists will lay a wreath also.
   ``He's our only hero, and they want to take him,'' Ms. Higgins
said.
   The Rev. Richard G. Butler, pastor of the Church of Jesus Christ
Christian-Aryan Nations, said the march was set on the day after
Davis' birthday to honor ``white heroes.''
   ``Sam Davis was a hero of our people and nobody has ever honored
him,'' Butler said.
   Butler's group claims several hundred members across the
country, but he did not know how many to expect on Saturday. ``All
members of our race are welcome,'' he said when asked whether Klan
members and skinheads would march.
   He said the town's condemnation ``doesn't bother us a bit.''
   Police Chief Stanley Newton said at least 50 state and local
officers will monitor the march.
   Residents concede that Pulaski is no utopia of racial equality.
   William McNairy, president of the local branch of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, described race
relatons as ``average.'' Giles County is about 20 percent black.
   Ms. Higgins noted that the local country club has no black
members.
   ``I think this whole thing will draw attention to some areas we
have not examined closely enough before,'' she said.
   Businessman Don Massey made his protest on the side of a
building he owns.
   A bronze plaque commemorating the birth of the KKK has hung
there for 72 years. This month he turned the plaque to the wall.
   ``If we just took it down, it really wouldn't say anything,''
Massey said. ``This was my way to say we can't just turn our backs
on the other signs of bigotry and hatred as if they weren't there.''

<HEAD>Peruvian Leftists Bomb Lunch Counter, Continue Killings in Highlands</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leftist rebels dynamited a lunch counter two
blocks from where Congress sits, seriously wounding eight
breakfasting policemen and two other customers, police said.
   Also Monday, Maoist Shining Path guerrillas shot to death the
deputy administrator of the highland city of Huancayo and a
companion, bringing to 13 the number of people killed in political
violence since Saturday, police said.
   The violence struck as Peru prepared to act as host at a meeting
of Latin American foreign ministers next week prior to two meetings
of Latin American presidents.
   In Lima, rebels threw a dynamite bomb onto the tin roof of a
lunchroom in a public market where policemen were eating. The
explosion ripped open the roof and shattered the small restaurant's
counter and lunch tables.
   Police said rebel assassins killed Flavio Llerena, Huancayo's
deputy administrative chief, and an unidentified man accompanying
him as they walked along a street in the major Andean city 140
miles east of Lima.
   Rebels killed four policemen Sunday night in an attack on the
police post in Palpa 42 miles southeast of Ica, the desert town 185
miles southeast of Lima where the presidents of Peru, Colombia,
Venezuela, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay are to meet on
Oct. 11.
   Police at the post drove away the attackers, killing two rebels,
police said.
   In Ica the same night, Shining Path gunmen broke into the house
of Oswaldo Aspilcueta, a state university rector, and killed his
wife, police said. They said the rebels apparently were after
Aspilcueta, a member of Peru's legal Communist Party.
   The Shining Path split from the Communist Party in 1970 and took
up arms in 1980. It views party members as traitors to its dogmatic
version of Maoism.
   Also on Sunday night, Shining Path rebels killed the deputy
mayor of Huamachuco, a town in La Libertad department 290 miles
northwest of Lima.
   On Saturday guerrillas shot three people to death, two in Rio
Negro, 160 miles east of Lima, and one on the outskirts of Huancayo.

<HEAD>Rallying Against Rushdie at the Royal Albert Hall</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After chants of ``Allahu akbar!'' echoed in the
cavernous Royal Albert Hall, the audience was told passages from
``The Satanic Verses'' would be read aloud and those who couldn't
take it had two minutes to leave.
   No one stirred. Then a tall man with a white beard and skullcap
took the podium and fired the latest salvo in the year-long Moslem
campaign against the novel and its author, Salman Rushdie.
   In a worldwide effort to suppress a novel they consider
blasphemous, Moslems have rioted, burned books, gone to court and
threatened to kill Rushdie. The author, born a Moslem in India, now
lives in Britain.
   Many who condemn him have turned to Ahmed Deedat, a 72-year-old
Moslem scholar from South Africa with a simple message: Read the
book.
   It may be a painful experience, Deedat says, but Moslems who
know what the novel says have a much better chance of convincing
Westerners their cause is just.
   He does not feel the blasphemy argument will convince Westerners
``The Satanic Verses'' should be suppressed, but he believes they
would be more responsive if they knew what the book says about
Britain, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and the West in general.
   To prove his point, he regaled the 6,000 Moslems in the Royal
Albert Hall on Sunday afternoon with four-letter words extracted
from the 547-page novel.
   Rushdie is abusing his adopted country, Deedat declared, so the
Moslem argument should go like this: ``Admitted that Rushdie has
many filthy, dirty and obscene things to say about Islam and its
heroes and heroines; but sir, do you know what he has to say about
you, his benefactors and protectors?''
   Deedat has an engaging, folksy manner and the voice and vigor of
a man half his age. He argues cogently, in simple language, and has
a keen eye for Western hypocrisies.
   Citing a newspaper report about British lawmakers demanding that
American actor Mickey Rourke be barred from Britain for using a
four-letter word to describe Mrs. Thatcher's policies, Deedat
expressed confidence they would feel the same about Rushdie.
   Applause greeted his presentation, but at least one listener
spotted an apparent flaw and expressed it during question time. The
young man said Britain would not ban the book, however insulting,
because its ``people are tolerant.'' Another troubling matter for
questioners was the death sentence imposed on Rushdie by Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, the Iranian revolutionary patriarch who died in
June. Rushdie went into hiding after Khomeini issued his
declaration Feb. 14.
   Deedat deflected questions on that subject, saying it required
an entire two-hour lecture by itself.
   In an interview afterward, he said the death threat had become a
political issue: ``One group wants to take a certain stand which is
against another group. I'm not interested in groupings. I'm
interested in the best way to solve a problem.''
   To many questioners, the problem was how to interpret the death
sentence. A young woman described hardships encountered at school
because of her attempts to defend the Moslem attitude toward
Rushdie.
   Someone else suggested Deedat was in conflict with the Koran,
the Moslem holy book, if he did not support killing Rushdie.
   Sunday's gathering underscored contrasts in modern,
multicultural Britain:
   Arabic chants of ``God is Great!'' in a hall built as a monument
to the traditional British way of life; young men in jeans and
T-shirts kneeling on the lawn at the foot of the ornate Albert
Memorial across the road, praying to Mecca; stalls selling prayer
mats, Korans, alcohol-free perfumes and cassettes of Deedat's
remarks.
   It was a placid scene, but a Moslem weekly distributed Friday
outside the Albert Hall had expressed the undercurrent of unease.
   ``Peaceloving Moslems fear that a time shall come when the
British public would begin to identify an average Moslem as a
terrorist and feelings of hate could ruin the otherwise peaceful
coexistence,'' it said.

<TEXT>
   There is fresh, white lettering on the
battered sign welcoming tourists to this ancient capital _ once
visited by Alexander the Great, by Marco Polo, by Tamerlaine and by
hippies tramping through Asia.
   Now, the main square is filled with armed militiamen and an
armored personnel carrier is parked 20 yards away.
   The square bristles with Kalashnikov rifles and rocket-propelled
grenade launchers, carried by militiamen who left the mujahedeen
rebels to join the government.
   There has been no fighting for months. But residents of this
northern town hate the unruly militiamen and say they smoke
hashish, demand goods at half price and prey on people traveling
after dusk.
   It is part of President Najib's policy of giving weapons, money
and local autonomy to those who leave the Pakistani-based rebel
coalition that is trying to topple his government in Kabul.
   Fear of the militias is not unique to Balkh.
   In the refugee center in Mazar-e-Sharif, a provincial capital 11
miles east of Balkh, 12 people said they were attacked by a
government militia when they crossed the border from Iran. They
said they lost watches, turbans, and cash. In Balkh, an officer in
the local army garrison acknowledged the militias were beyond
control and warned visitors to be out of town by 4 p.m.
   ``The roads just aren't safe after 5 o'clock,'' said taxi driver
Ahmed Ibrahim. ``The bandits stop you and take money, watches,
sometimes the car itself.''
   Balkh, one of history's crossroads, has seen conquerors before.
But by the time of the 1978 revolution it was a backwater, a quiet
camping site on the hippie trail to the subcontinent and the Far
East.
   Balkh's past reads like a who was who of Central Asia.
   In the 5th centrury B.C, it became the capital of the first
Aryan empire, before they moved on to Persia and India. The Greek
historian Heroditus put Balkh in his chronicles.
   Alexander the Great paused long enough on a 4th century B.C.
march to India to marry Roxane, the daughter of a local tribal
chief.
   The Arab forces that arrived in 645 were so stunned by its
beauty they called Balkh, ``mother of all cities.''
   Ghengis Khan razed Balkh and put all residents to the sword in
1220. Marco Polo visited the ruins in 1275, and Tamerlane crowned
himself emperor in the rebuilt city in 1359.
   But those were Balkh's last halcyon days. Centuries of fighting
gave the city a bad name. So when the northern provinces became
part of emerging Afghanistan in 1866, the new capital was put at
Mazar.
   Tamerlane's massive mud brick walls melted like a sand castle,
and much of the glorious mosque built in 1597 crumbled.
   But its blue-tiled dome and a triumphant arch in the circular,
shady park at the town's center made it an idyllic spot for young
Westerners tramping across Asia.
   Afghanistan was a main drug haven from 1970 to 1973, when the
previous hashish capital of Nepal required all travelers to show a
minimum $500 in cash.
   ``They were always stoned,'' said a toothless old man.
   ``But in those days, people smoked hashish secretly,'' the old
man said. ``Now they do it openly.''
   Did he mean the militia men swaggering nearby?
   ``Don't ask me, I stay in the mosque,'' he said.
   Until seven months ago, when the Soviets withdrew their troops,
the residents lived in fear of rocket attacks and fighting.
   No one is quite how many were killed on both sides, but
residents think more than 1,000 people died.
   The road to Mazar was unsafe. Many of the surrounding wheat
fields reverted to desert, their irrigation systems collapsed and
their owners fled.
   The population of the area droped from 80,000 to 60,000.
   ``One or two years ago it was very dangerous here,'' said
Mohammed Isar, who has sold boiled chickpeas in the park for 20
years.
   ``The opposition groups used to attack with rockets. Now that
they have joined with the government, it is peaceful.''
   Farmers have started cultivating again in the past year, but the
town still has a menacing air.
   Militiamen roar around in trucks, raising streams of dust over
the broad, unpaved streets.
   Voices drop when the townsmen talk about the militia.
   ``They take things or pay only half the money,'' whispered the
chickpea seller. ``The people hate them.''
   ``People are afraid of the militia, they don't accept them,''
said Ahmed Nadr, 30. ``They switch sides all the time.''
   The only hotel was commandeered by a militia group that joined
the government three years ago.
   At the edge of town a request to walk on the still massive
remnants of Tamerlane's walls is discouraged.
   ``There could be mines,'' the government escort said.
   No one expects tourists back soon.

   Many a face was red when a team of
auxiliary firefighters taking part in an exhibition watched as the
fire they were supposed to put out spread to a wider area, the
national news agency reported.
   The firemen were showing off their skills Monday in response to
an ``emergency'' during the launching of the Safety Month Campaign
at the compound of the Chemical Company of Malaysia.
   But instead of applause, they got laughs.
   They had tried to extinguish several burning planks in a drum of
gasoline but the blaze instead spread to a grassy area, the Bernama
news agency said. This would not have occured had the firemen used
foam instead of water, said a Fire Services Department spokesman.
   The firefighters finally managed to put out the fire when one
removed the planks from the drum.

<HEAD>In the Tabloid TV Battle, `Current Affair' and `Hard Copy' Fight
for No. 1</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first reports from the new tabloid
television wars are in, and ``A Current Affair'' and ``Hard Copy''
both have opened strongly while ``Inside Edition'' and ``USA Today
on TV'' appear doomed.
   In this fall's jammed field of reality-based shows, other early
casualties look to be ``Crimewatch Tonight,'' ``Trial by Jury'' and
``USA Today Weekend.''
   According to the initial Nielsen Syndication Service ratings,
Fox's nightly ``A Current Affair'' was the seventh most popular
syndicated show at the start of the new television season.
Finishing ahead of ``Entertainment Tonight'' and ``Donahue'' in the
ratings, ``A Current Affair'' was seen in more than 6.9 million
homes, the survey said.
   ``Every time a new show starts like `Hard Copy,' `Inside
Edition' or `Crimewatch Tonight' it becomes more competitive,''
said Peter Brennan, co-executive producer of ``A Current Affair.''
   ``But the strange thing...is that when `Inside Edition' started
we never had better numbers. So far, in the first week against
`Hard Copy,' we've done the highest numbers we've ever done.''
   Brennan said ``A Current Affair'' has attempted to fight off its
challengers by trying to ``give more serious thought to the stories
we do. You try to avoid doing the celebrity rip-offs and the easy
T&amp;A shock-value stories.''
   He said critics who blast ``A Current Affair's'' coverage of
news and personalities as tawdry aren't fair to the show's intent.
   ``The worst kind of criticism that's written says that shows
like `A Current Affair' seek to horrify, shock and offend,''
Brennan said. ``Because if somebody shocks and horrifies and
offends me on a regular basis, I'm going to turn off. And I won't
let my kids to watch it, either.''
   Because it debuted Sept. 18, ``Hard Copy'' was not included in
the first Nielsen syndication report. But the news-oriented
program, once entitled ``Tabloid,'' has performed strongly in Los
Angeles, Chicago, New York and San Francisco, according to its
producers.
   Furthermore, ``Hard Copy'' consistently has boosted some
stations' ratings from four months ago, the show's representatives
say. In Hartford, Conn., for example, ``Hard Copy'' is delivering
to WVIT an audience 60 percent larger than ``Win, Lose or Draw''
did in May.
   ``For a new show, we got off to a pretty solid start,'' says
Mark Monsky, executive producer of ``Hard Copy.'' ``We came off the
blocks very quickly. Right now we have to prove to the people who
did tune us in that what they got was just a little bit of what
they could get.''
   In its first few weeks on the air, ``Hard Copy'' has reported
exclusives on Imelda Marcos and the death of her husband and the
bombing of the Pan Am airliner over Scotland.
   ``I think our intention is very clear. At the top of the show,
we want to be very close to what's going on,'' Monsky said. ``And
then we want to go deeper and deeper in trying to explore the
widest possible range of the people involved.''
   The top five shows in the syndicated market for the week ending
Sept. 17 are, in order, ``Wheel of Fortune,'' ``Jeopardy,'' ``The
Oprah Winfrey Show,'' ``The Cosby Show'' and the weekend version of
``Wheel of Fortune.''
   ``Inside Edition'' finished at No. 22, ``USA Today'' landed at
No. 32 and ``Crimewatch Tonight'' was No. 46. ``Trial by Jury'' was
No. 62 and the weekend version of ``USA Today'' was No. 77.
   In one strange twist, the makers of ``Inside Edition'' have
discussed the possibility of inviting celebrities on the show to
rebut any distortions written about them in the supermarket
tabloids.
   However ``Inside Edition'' is revamped, though, it seems likely
it will be replaced by ``30 Minutes.'' Producer Av Westin, a
veteran of ABC News, has joined ``Inside Edition'' maker King World
Productions to create the new syndicated news magazine.
   New reality shows added to network schedules all have debuted
poorly. Of the 81 shows covered in last week's regular Nielsen
survey, ABC's ``Primetime Live,'' hosted by Sam Donaldson and Diane
Sawyer, finished 49th. CBS' ``Rescue 911,'' with William Shatner,
landed in 55th. And CBS' ``Saturday Night With Connie Chung'' came
in 71st.

   It had been almost a week, and
21-year-old Julia Mendoza's crying was done.
   But her mother, Maria, who had listened stoically to her
daughter's account of rape by a policeman of the National Police,
could contain herself no more.
   She sobbed when Julia described the soft-voiced rapist zipping
up his pants and saying, ``Maybe that will make you want to
collaborate.''
   Allegations of mistreatment of prisoners have abounded since the
rightist government of Alfredo Cristiani took office June 1 and
began to move against what they called ``guerrilla fronts'' _
public organizations that sympathize with or support guerrilla
positions on some or many issues.
   The rebels, over the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front's
clandestine radio, called the police ``animals'' for the alleged
rapes.
   ``This is too much to stand for,'' they said. The insurgents
warned that continued repression and rights abuse will endanger a
preliminary peace process begun last month in Mexico with talks
between government and guerrilla representatives.
   ``Just as we have been flexible and broadminded in order to
negotiate, we are likewise completely disposed to, and capable of
accompanying the struggle of the entire people, and to take hold of
the flagpole of democracy and peace and carry it forward to drive
it into the heart of those who only want war,'' said the rebel high
command.
   Asked about the accusations, Maj. Mauricio Chavez Caceres, head
of the armed forces press committee, said: ``All commanders take
pains to ensure that a prisoner's human rights are respected,
because they know these people will come out of the police stations
alleging this and that kind of abuse in order to make us look bad.''
   In what they called a response to escalated repression, the
guerrillas last week launched their first nationwide offensive
since May. Seventy-eight people were killed or wounded in the
combat, adding to the toll of a 10-year-old civil war that has
taken 70,000 lives.
   It was visiting day at the women's prison six miles east of San
Salvador, and Maria sat outside next to Julia behind a backboard on
the cement basketball court as she told her story.
   Julia Mendoza is one of three women at Ilopango jail who say
they were raped at National Police headquarters after their arrest
the night of Sept. 18 following a demonstration that turned violent.
   The National Federation of Salvadoran Workers sponsored the
march, during which police were taunted by masked demonstrators
wielding iron bars and two city buses were set afire.
   Authorities released 25 of 64 arrested demonstrators, but seven
women and 32 men were held.
   Dr. Roberto Maldonado, a forensic specialist who examined 37 of
the 39, found corroboration of the rape allegation only in Miss
Mendoza's case.
   The government and armed forces say prisoners like Miss Mendoza
are leftist guerrilla operatives masquerading as labor activists
and that they invent accusations of torture and abuse to slander
authorities.
   The workers federation, known as FENESTRAS by its Spanish
initials, in fact espouses a political agenda identical to that of
rebels who have waged war against a succession of U.S.-backed
governments.
   But union and peasant organizations, as well as local and
international rights groups, say the fact that an individual might
support guerrilla positions does not strip him of the right not to
be tortured, raped or summarily executed.
   Maldonado found bruises, cuts and scrapes on 20 of those
arrested after the Sept. 18 march. All said they were beaten during
interrogation.
   All said their interrogators belabored them about alleged
membership in guerrilla units and insisted they provide names of
cohorts.
   Superior Court Judge Luis Morales, in charge of the unionists'
cases, told The Associated Press that many of the injuries could
have been inflicted with billy clubs during the suspects'
apprehension.
   The New York-based Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, after a
four-month study of justice in El Salvador, said in a report this
year, ``We have identified a pattern of psychological as well as
physical abuse of detainees.''
   The U.S. State Department, in its 1989 human rights report to
Congress, said of El Salvador: ``Reports of abuse by arresting
forces continue ... . Instances of severe beatings, rape, choking,
injection with drugs and electric shock were reported.''
   The State Department said the allegations ``are extremely
difficult to prove or disprove.''
   Morales said that's because the judiciary depends entirely on
the police forces for investigations.
   ``We receive many allegations of rape, but they never get
anywhere,'' he said. ``In Miss Mendoza's case, practically
speaking, resolution would be impossible. She was blindfolded and
cannot identify the man. And the same National Police that are
accused of committing the crime would be in charge of investigating
it.''
   He suggested creation of a police force responsible solely to
the judiciary to avoid such conflicts of interest.
   ``Just having an investigative arm separate from the executive
branch would be great progress,'' he said.
   Members of the Treasury Police were accused of raping and
beating detainees after the April arrests of dozens of members of
refugees organizations considered guerrilla fronts by authorities.
   Col. Rene Emilio Ponce, chief of the joint chiefs of staff,
promised an investigation. After repeated requests by the AP,
Chavez Caceres reported that the Treasury Police had investigated
itself and found no wrongdoing.

   After 16 years of haggling, a license was
granted for widening a road next to the wall of Jerusalem's Old
City. But work was halted days later when a bulldozer uncovered a
Byzantine bathhouse no one knew existed.
   It's a typical hazard for developers in Jerusalem, a city that
dates back some 3,500 years and where a shovel put in the ground
almost anywhere can turn up archaeological artifacts.
   ``We have an overload of history here,'' said Aharon Meir, a
city archaeologist. ``That's what makes Jerusalem different. If you
don't bother to check, you can simply bulldoze important findings
away.''
   Meir supervises the archaeological dig launched where
construction crews have temporarily ceased building a 820-foot
stretch of the new Mamilla Road.
   The finds so far indicate that contrary to earlier belief, the
roughly square-mile walled city may have once extended beyond the
current walls, Meir said.
   The new road runs near the Old City's Jaffa Gate, built by the
Turkish ruler Suleiman the Magnificent in the 16th Century.
Although long considered a possible archaeological site, the area
was never excavated by researchers.
   For years, it was off limits as a battlefield or ceasefire zone
between Israeli and Arab armies. After Israel captured it and the
rest of east Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war,
other sections of the city were given priority by archaeologists.
   One example was ``King David's City,'' near the holy Al Aqsa
Mosque, and the Wailing Wall remnant of the ancient Jewish temples.
   At the Jaffa Gate, excavators have dug more than 2,000 years
into the past, stopping when they hit bedrock that indicated they
had found the earliest settlement.
   Two structures so far uncovered _ a bathhouse and a large public
building yet to be identified _ have been tentatively dated from
the Byzantine period of the Roman Empire, or about the 4th century.
   Also discovered by Meir, helped by several dozen Palestinian
laborers, is an intricate web of water cisterns, apparently part of
an aqueduct system that supplied the ancient city's water.
   ``These may not look like stupendous finds, but they provide
little important tidbits of information about what life was like.
If we give up these little things, we would miss the larger
picture,'' Meir said.
   As he spoke hundreds of vehicles crawled at a snail's pace above
on the main road, which has been temporarily narrowed to two lanes.
   Meir said the planned road would likely be completed eventually,
but the section adjacent to the dig may have to be diverted or
lifted onto an overpass that would allow tourists to see the
ancient ruins underneath.
   Under a city ordinance, contractors must sponsor an
archaeological survey of any building site if historical relics are
found during construction. Usually, a compromise is worked out so
building can continue.
   The new road is part of a $250 million project to build a hotel,
apartment buildings and a shopping plaza in Mamilla, a
predominantly Arab quarter before Israel's 1948 independence war.
   Several plans for developing Mamilla have been shelved since
1973 amid huge disputes between planners and environmentalists.
Among other complaints, the environmentalists expressed fears the
new road could increase pollution, causing damage to old buildings.
   In the current project, a compromise was struck in which the
planned road was narrowed from six to three lanes and several old
structures were spared being leveled.
   Officials of the Karta Company, developers of Mamilla, said they
hoped the latest delay will not last beyond the end of the month so
they can meet their building schedule. But they take it
philosophically.
   ``In some places they make a fuss over remains only 100 years
old, here we're talking about things dating to 2,000 years,'' said
Karta's deputy director, Yaacov Brandt.
   The latest complication in the Mamilla plan is typical of what
most building projects in Jerusalem have faced in the last two
decades, ranging from housing developments in the Jewish Quarter of
the Old City to the Hebrew University campus on Mt. Scopus.
   Last year, preparations for a shopping mall were halted when
excavators found two prehistoric farming villages from the Bronze
Age at the city's southern outskirts. A compromise to allow
building of the mall is reportedly being worked out.

<HEAD>Soviet Union: Nuclear Superpower With Third World Economy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union is a nuclear superpower
saddled with a Third World economy and that situation won't change
any time soon, even with Mikhail Gorbachev's reform efforts, many
Soviet experts believe.
   If anything, these analysts said, the Soviet economy is in worse
shape now than when Gorbachev launched his perestroika, or
restructuring program.
   He is facing the need to slash a huge budget deficit in half
while at the same time coping with an economy which went into a
nosedive in the spring even as inflation was heating up.
   ``The Soviet economy has fallen behind,'' said Howard Wachtel,
an economics professor at American University in Washington. ``When
you take off the tight controls of a command system, you lose the
threat over people and you get a drop in productivity unless you
replace it with something else, like market incentives.''
   Gorbachev's economic troubles were the subject of discussions
which took place in conjunction with the Wyoming meetings a week
ago between Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
   One of the officials at that meeting, Robert Zoellick, a State
Department aide to Baker, will be traveling to Moscow with Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan from Oct. 7-11 for continued
discussions on the Soviet economy.
   Officials said the Soviets are studying a wide variety of ideas
such as restoring faith in the Russian ruble by backing the
currency with gold.
   The fact that the Soviets are calling for advice from Greenspan,
a disciple of anti-communist philosopher Ayn Rand, has not gone
unnoticed as a sign of how intent Gorbachev is in introducing
change.
   An official from the central bank of the Soviet Union, the
Gosbank, attended the annual meetings this year of the 152-nation
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
   The Soviet Union has said it would like to join the two
international lending agencies, a move that would make the Soviets
eligible for economic assistance of the type already being received
by China and Poland, two communist countries already in the IMF and
World Bank.
   While officials of both organizations stressed that they do not
have any formal application from the Soviets before them, they did
not dismiss out of hand the idea of Soviet membership down the road.
   Richard Feinberg, executive director of the Overseas Development
Council, a Washington-based research group, said he believes that
integrating the Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries
into the world economy could be a central purpose for the IMF and
the World Bank in the next decade.
   The two organizations, formed 44 years ago, originally had the
mission of rebuilding the war-torn economies of Europe and Japan.
   Feinberg said full membership for the Soviet Union probably will
not occur for three to four years, given the need to iron out such
problems as opening the historically secret Soviet economy to
greater review by foreign banking experts. But Feinberg said the
IMF could begin sooner to provide policy assistance to the Soviets.
   ``The IMF possesses expertise in the areas in which the Soviet
Union badly needs guidance _ money and banking, price reform and
exchange and trade relations,'' he said.
   Many experts believe that the economic assistance program
currently being developed for Poland and its new Solidarity-led
government could serve as a blueprint for helping the Soviet Union.
   But officials say it would be wrong to underestimate the
enormity of the task in the Soviet Union.
   ``We shouldn't be looking for miracles. There is no panacea for
the Soviet economy,'' said Joseph Pelzman, an economics professor
at George Washington University. He said the basic problem is that
the Soviet society has no memory of how a market-based economy
works.
   ``You can bring in foreigners, but that is not the same as
having local entrepreneurs to call on,'' he said. ``The Soviets
have had 67 years with no business class.''
   Pelzman said Gorbachev will be forced to begin building up a
foreign debt in order to import consumer goods as a way of
demonstrating to a skeptical public that his economic policies can
produce benefits for ordinary citizens.
   ``If he can stock the stores, he has bought himself a couple of
years. But if he can't satisfy local consumers, then he is out of
luck,'' Pelzman said. ``The opposition will move in and say
Gorbachev's program is not working.''

<TEXT>
   Rescue crews freed six sperm
whales that beached on Prince Edward Island's north-shore national
park, but one of the huge sea mammals died.
   As a crowd of hundreds watched Sunday, federal fisheries
officers sent divers to tie slings, one at a time, around the tails
of the creatures, which ranged in length from about 40 to 65 feet.
   A jet-ski took the line to a waiting Parks Canada boat, which
then towed each whale out about 300 feet then tried to keep it from
returning to the beach by circling it.
   The shoreside crowd let out a rousing cheer as the first
surviving whale blew a high spout of water upon reaching the open
ocean.
   Fisheries officers said they believed the dead whale drowned.
   It was not known what caused the whales to become trapped
between two sandbars, but a fisheries spokesman said one
possibility was that the sound of a jackhammer working on a nearby
bridge might have attracted them.
   Whales have been known to beach themselves trying to answer the
distress calls from other beached whales.
   The beaching was reported early Sunday.
   Covehead is near the eastern end of the national park between
Brackley and Dalvay beaches.

<TEXT>
   Suddenly, newly aggressive Democrats on
Capitol Hill are trying to paint President Bush into a corner
labeled ``timid.''
   Democrats are displaying a greater willingness to challenge the
adequacy of the president's policies and to spell out stronger _
and generally more expensive _ Democratic alternatives.
   Led by Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine,
Democrats are spelling out an alternative Democratic agenda on
issue after issue while portraying Bush's programs as inadequate,
his funding proposals anemic and his entire approach as
unacceptably ``timid.''
   The effort is leaving Republicans grumbling that they are being
whipsawed in a political bidding war in which ``one-upsmanship'' is
the principal weapon.
   Although the signs have been building, Ron Brown, the national
Democratic chairman, appeared to fire the starting gun last week
when he told fellow Democrats it was time ``to start taking on
George Bush.''
   Accusing Bush of ``timidly following the prevailing winds'' of
announcing ambitious programs and lofty goals without providing the
means to pay for them, Brown called on the president to begin
``matching his actions to his charming words.''
   In Congress, Mitchell and many other Democrats have been
challenging Bush on nearly identical grounds and in very specific
terms.
   Recent examples:
   _Democrats in the House as well as the Senate demanded sharply
increased aid for helping non-communist forces build democracy in
Poland and Hungary, billions of dollars beyond the $218 million
Bush wants to spread over three years. Deputy Democratic Leader
Alan Cranston of California calls the Bush approach ``pathetically
timid.''
   _Democrats, challenging the adequacy of Bush's commitment to the
war on drugs, led a successful fight to boost spending by $1.1
billion, earmarking most of the additional money for prevention and
treatment.
   _Mitchell is leading a new Democratic drive to spell out a plan
to improve the quality of American education, to take the luster
from Bush's claim to be ``the education president,'' and to
underscore the historic Democratic contribution to public education.
   _The majority leader has named a Democratic task force to chart
ways to broaden housing opportunities, address the problems of the
homeless and highlight Republican scandals in the Department of
Housing and Urban Development.
   _Democrats are battling Bush's bid to reduce capital gains
taxes. They want to revive Individual Retirement Accounts to help
average Americans save for education, housing and retirement.
   ``There's going to be a lot more of that kind of thing,'' says
Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn. ``We're not just going to be
standing around waiting for the president to act.''
   ``You are going to find a more active, more aggressive party in
the Senate,'' Dodd said. ``You may see us move even before the
White House does.''
   Dodd and many other congressional Democrats say there is a
distinct advantage in having a coherent position on as many issues
as possible in order to build up bargaining chips in negotiations
with the White House.
   And some Democrats are fearful of being bruised if the effort
results in a head-to-head confrontation with a president pledged
not to raise taxes.
   There is a lot of political gamesmanship in all of this.
   Some Republicans say the name of that game is, ``me-too, only
more so.''
   ``It's clear they've decided that the honeymoon is over with
Bush, and that they need a way to counteract his popularity,'' says
an adviser to a senior Senate Republican. ``And the only thing they
can come up with is, `be tougher, be more aggressive, take shots at
Bush.'''
   ``It's a do-more-then-they-are strategy, a one-upsmanship
strategy,'' he said.
   ``As we see it, the hidden agenda is to somehow make Bush raise
taxes.''
   Mitchell, who has been majority leader for only nine months, has
been under increasing pressure by other Democrats to get out in
front on policy matters, to become far less timid himself in
confronting the president.
   As his apprenticeship ends, he is clearly attempting exactly
that.

   A Senate panel is delaying confirmation of
President Bush's nominee to head the Urban Mass Transportation
Administration while it investigates work done by his auditing
firm, Senate sources say.
   The Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee is
examining the relationship between nominee Brian Clymer's suburban
Philadelphia accounting firm and an economic development
organization nearby, according to Senate aides who spoke only on
condition of anonymity.
   The organization, the Delaware County Partnership for Economic
Development, is the subject of a broad audit by the Department of
Housing and Urban Development, HUD Inspector General Paul Adams
said in an interview Friday.
   The Senate panel unanimously backed Clymer's nomination on Sept.
8, but has since put a ``hold'' on sending it for a vote for the
full Senate.
   Clymer, 42, is the former vice chairman of the Southeastern
Pennsylvania Transportation Authority. UMTA assists state and local
governments in improving mass transportation systems. He has
declined requests to be interviewed about the matter.
   The local partnership, which has received $500,000 in HUD grants
in the past year, was founded in 1983 by U.S. Rep. Curt Weldon,
R-Pa., who has said he is not involved in its daily affairs. The
congressman ordered a consultant to investigate the partnership
earlier this year when it was disclosed that several of Weldon's
campaign supporters had received no-bid contracts.
   Of particular interest to the Senate panel are no-bid contracts
that the Philadelphia Inquirer reported were awarded to Clymer's
firm by the partnership to audit its books.
   Clymer has been Weldon's campaign treasurer in the last three
elections.
   Anthony J. Dunleavy, the consultant retained at Weldon's
request, said in his report to Weldon that this year's contract
given Clymer's firm was properly bid. However, the Inquirer
reported that Dunleavy said that previous year's contracts with
Clymer's firm were not awarded through competitive procurement
policies required by the federal government. The newspaper said
federal money was used.
   In his report to Weldon, which has been made public, Dunleavy
also said the partnership misspent $125,000 in federal funds on
ineligible items such as a promotion film and advertising. William
Tancredi, a top official of the partnership, resigned in July after
coming under fire for his handling of the organization's finances.
   Adams, the inspector general, said HUD was conducting a general
audit of the partnership that was ``not limited in any way, shape
or form.''
   HUD was doing another audit in Delaware County when ``a
combination of things occurred concurrently'' that convinced it of
the need to look into the partnership, Adams said. He declined to
be more specific.

   The Voice of America says it's taken care of a
Catch-22 situation in which its broadcasts to Angola were disturbed
by a radio station run by U.S.-backed rebels.
   But Rep. Mervyn Dymally, D-Calif., says he wants to know exactly
what happened this summer when ``The Voice of Resistance of the
Black Cockerel,'' a station experts say was set up by the CIA,
interrupted Portuguese-language broadcasts by the VOA, the
U.S.-government-supported station that serves overseas listeners.
   Dymally, chairman of the House subcommittee on international
operations, said last week he'll raise the issue in panel hearings
this year. ``I wrote a letter of protest about it,'' he said.
   ``The need is great for the VOA to have at this time unhindered
and unhampered access to its consumers in Southern Africa,''
Dymally said in a letter.
   The problem with the broadcasts is an outgrowth of the conflict
in Angola where the rebels headed by Jonas Savimbi are battling the
Soviet-backed government in Luanda.
   Savimbi, who is visiting the United States this week, receives
American government money to finance his group, the National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola, known as UNITA.
   UNITA operates the black cockerel resistance station, which
Gerald Bender, a professor at the University of Southern
California, said is a ``CIA-supported clandestine radio station.''
   Initial reports, first published in The Washington Post last
month, said the UNITA station blocked 12 minutes of an Aug. 18 VOA
broadcast that included four minutes of a speech by Angolan
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos.
   Joseph O'Connell, a spokesman for the United States Information
Agency, the parent agency of VOA, said U.S. officials do not
believe the UNITA station intentionally fouled VOA broadcasts. ``We
don't consider it jamming,'' he said.
   But the two stations used frequencies that were close to each
other so the VOA listener could hear the rebel station's broadcasts
at the end of the VOA program.
   ``You could hear their signature. It sounds like a rooster
crowing,'' he said.
   To eliminate confusion, VOA changed frequencies, he said.
   Jardo Muekalia, a UNITA spokesman in Washington, denied the
rebels interfered with the VOA broadcasts. But he charged that
VOA's reporter in Luanda had prepared biased reports designed to
imply the United States favored the Angolan government.
   O'Connell said VOA has dismissed the notion the reporter is not
objective. ``We have been pleased with what he has done. We have
not seen any bias,'' he said.

   Many Vietnam era veterans who want to take

   The GI bill program that covers people who served during Vietnam
ends Dec. 31. A new GI bill has taken its place, but only the
Vietnam veterans who remained on active duty from June 1985 through
June 1988 may benefit.
   According to Rep. John J. Rhodes III, R-Ariz., 250,000 veterans
are affected. Many are GIs who stayed in the military but left
before the end of June 1988.
   Although legislative efforts have been made to extend the
benefits, neither veterans' committee in the House or Senate is
taking up the measures.
   ``It's a damn shame this is going to come to an end and is going
to hurt so many Vietnam veterans who have made the military a
career,'' said Paul S. Egan of the 35,000-member Vietnam Veterans
of America.
   VVA's Egan, like Richard W. Johnson Jr. of the Non-Commissioned
Officers' Association, argue that the veterans being squeezed out
of the programs are the ones who ``carried'' the military during
the 1970s, when it was plagued by low enlistment and low morale.
   The 153,000-member Fleet Reserve Association, representing
career enlisted personnel in the Navy, Marine Corps and Coast
Guard, has urged an extension of benefits.
   Neither of the two major veterans' groups, the American Legion
or the Veterans of Foreign Wars, spoke out on the issue in a recent
House subcommittee hearing on the GI bill.
   Rep. G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery, chairman of the House Veterans
Affairs Committee, opposes extending benefits under the so-called
``Cold War'' GI bill. The Mississippi Democrat says the bill is too
costly, unnecessary to help veterans readjust 14 years after the
war, and unneeded for a group of people who had already made a
career choice _ for the military.
   ``It's time to move on to a new bill designed to recruit and
retrain rather than just reintegrate,'' said committee spokesman
Jim Holley.
   The GI bill that expires Dec. 31 followed the Korean War GI bill
and the pioneering World War II GI bill.
   There was also a Veterans' Educational Assistance Program for
people who enlisted from 1977 to 1985. The program offered a
maximum benefit of $225 monthly and was based entirely on the
enlistees' contributions.
   The Vietnam era bill is the most used, having served 8.1 million
veterans, compared with 7.8 million for the World War II program.
The Vietnam bill, with no contributions, pays a maximum $376
million monthly benefit to full-time students with no dependents.
The maximum eligibility is 45 months.
   The Veterans' Affairs Department said in February that 750,000
people were eligible for benefits under the Vietnam-era bill and
60,000 were currently enrolled.
   The new program relies partly on pay deductions from recruits.
It pays $250 to $300 a month for up to three years, reflecting the
three years of active duty required for eligibility. A person is
eligible for up to 10 years after discharge.
   Those who entered the service during Vietnam could take
advantage of the new program if they served three years of active
duty starting June 30, 1985, when the bill took effect. The Vietnam
vets were not required to make further contributions.
   But Johnson of the 160,000-member NCO group said the service
regulations force many career non-commissioned officers to retire,
and many lost eligibility because they had to quit before the end
of June 1988.

   William Fairbank, a professor emertitus
of physics at Stanford University who pioneered in low-temperature
superconductivity, died Saturday after a heart attack. He was 72.
   Fairbank's first experiment in superconductivity _ the ability
of some materials to offer no resistance to an electrical current
if they are cooled to near absolute zero _ was in 1947 with his
brother, Henry, also a physicist.
   Stanford said Fairbank's influence on physics included the
university's development of the superconducting accelerator, in
which superconductivity is achieved at two degrees above absolute
zero. That led to the first demonstration of a free electron laser.
   Fairbank was born in Minneapolis on Feb. 24, 1917. He graduated
from Whitman College in Washington and earned his Ph.D. from Yale
University in 1948.
   Before joining Stanford faculty in 1959, he taught at the
University of Washington, Amherst College and Duke University, and
worked on the staff of the Radiation Laboratory at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

<HEAD>Truman Pictures Roosevelt as God-like, But Flawed by an Ego</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Harry S. Truman says he regarded his mentor,
Franklin D. Roosevelt, ``almost as a god'' even though Roosevelt
had an ego that sometimes got him into political trouble.
   In fact, the 33rd president says about the 32nd, Roosevelt's ego
was a factor which compelled him to break a tradition as old as the
republic and run for a third and fourth terms.
   Truman discusses his boss in a posthumous book, ``Where the Buck
Stops,'' to be published late this month by Warner Books, Inc. It
is edited by his daughter, Margaret Truman, who says her father
wanted its publication withheld until after he and wife Bess were
dead so that he could be completely candid.
   The book gives Truman's assessment of Roosevelt as a strong
leader but weak administrator and as a president whose ego
sometimes led him to mistakes.
   He cites one big example: FDR's ``court-packing'' plan of 1937.
Roosevelt wanted Congress to give him the power to enlarge the
Supreme Court, which had been striking down one New Deal program
after another.
   Truman writes that he supported Roosevelt's plan out of his
knowledge from history that Congress had changed the number of
justices over the years.
   But Truman says Roosevelt's ego led him to overestimate his
power and led to the most severe setback of his presidency.
   ``I didn't agree at all with Roosevelt's obvious feeling that he
had become so popular and so powerful that he could go ahead and
push through anything, even an unprecedented plan like that one,
without help and without bothering to try to convince people
opposed to the plan that he was right,'' Truman writes.
   ``The United States lost a bill that might have been very
helpful to the American people because Roosevelt's ego misinformed
him and made him believe he could win on his own.''
   Truman also says that he was troubled when Roosevelt decided in
1940 to ignore the two-term tradition and seek a third term. He
agreed with Roosevelt that the threat of war made it the wrong time
to change leaders, but he says FDR was motivated by the belief he
was the only person in the country capable of leading it.
   ``I thought there might have been a partially wrong reason
involved: that he wasn't doing it only because he felt it was best
to keep the same experienced man in place, but that he might also
have felt that he was the only possible man who could lead our
country to victory in the war,'' Truman writes.
   At another point, Truman says, ``I guess that was his principal
defect, that growing ego of his, which probably wasn't too
minuscule to start with, though perhaps it was his only flaw.''
   For all that, Truman says he admired Roosevelt enormously. He
cites his record in fighting both the Depression and the war, and
asks: ``Isn't that enough to make us think of him almost as a god?''
   ``He was a very, very pleasant man and a great
conversationalist,'' he writes, ``with marvelous flashes of humor
in almost everything he said, and he had a personality that made
people feel close to him.''
   Truman also pictures Roosevelt as ``a first-rate executive,
never afraid to make those decisions he made'' but a weak
administrator ``because he just wasn't able to delegate authority
to anybody else.''
   He said, ``I was always of the opinion that he ought to have
restraints, as every president should have, and I sometimes argued
with him myself when he wanted to go too far or when he set out to
do something strictly on his own and without the agreement or help
of others.''
   Historians have written that Roosevelt and Truman were not close
and Roosevelt did not keep his vice president informed, despite his
failing health. FDR died early in his fourth term without even
telling Truman about the atom bomb.
   Roosevelt accepted Truman as his running mate in 1944 after
becoming wary of Vice President Henry A. Wallace's left-wing
inclinations. Truman, a senator from Missouri, was widely respected
for thoroughgoing investigations he had conducted into wasteful war
contracts.

<HEAD>Democrats Say They Have Senate Votes to Kill Capital Gains Cut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic leaders claim they have the votes
in the Senate to kill President Bush's capital gains tax cut but
concede a watered-down version may get through Congress this year.
   Meanwhile, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley predicted Sunday that
the House probably will vote this week to repeal the Medicare
catastrophic health care coverage that it enacted only last year.
   ``I hope personally that the program is retained on a modified
form,'' Foley, D-Wash., said on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' program.
``But ... there are a great number of Republicans and some
Democrats in the House who are in favor of repeal. If I were
guessing today, I think it probably would be repealed.''
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, also appearing
on NBC, likened the House-passed version of Bush's cut in capital
gains taxes to the cocaine-based drug crack and said flatly that
the Senate will not enact it.
   ``It is so bad, so wrong for the economy,'' he said. ``It will
do for the deficit what crack does for the user: a quick short high
followed by a long, painful depression.''
   The Senate Finance Committee plans this week to consider an
alternative proposed by Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, and endorsed
by a majority of Senate Democrats which would instead restore
partial tax deductibility for contributions to Individual
Retirement Accounts.
   In other congressional action this week:
   _The House will take up a long-awaited bill to protect the
nation's waterways from oil spills similar to the Exxon-Valdez
tanker accident in March that dumped 10 million gallons of crude
into Alaska's Prince William Sound.
   _Negotiations continue between House and Senate conferees on a
dozen appropriations bills needed to finance government programs in
fiscal 1990, which began Sunday. A major sticking point is how much
the government will spend on Star Wars in fiscal 1990: The Senate
has appropriated $3.7 billion but the House wants to spend only
$3.1 billion.
   _Competing child care measures, both targeted primarily to
low-income families but one with the potential of being expanded to
eventually subsidize day care for the middle class as well, will be
considered by the House.
   _The House Government Operations subcommittee on employment and
housing continues its investigation into scandals at the Department
of Housing and Urban Development with a return appearance by
self-described influence-peddler Paul Manafort.
   Mitchell said Sunday he is positive that the 27-month capital
gains tax cut approved by the House last week will not win passage
in the Senate.
   However, he said Bush's ``irresponsible position ... makes it
extremely difficult to prevent any tax cut from occurring.''
   The House-passed measure would reduce from 33 percent to 19.6
percent the maximum tax rate on profits from the sale of stocks and
other investments until 1992. The rate would then climb back up to
28 percent with assets indexed so that any gains attributed to
inflation after that point would not be taxed.
   Economists predict the cut will generate some $9.4 billion in
deficit-reduction revenues over the next three years. After then,
revenue would fall and worsen the deficit by a total of $21 billion
over the following five years, according to the Congress' Joint
Committee on Taxation.
   ``I'm confident that this so-called yo-yo _ on two years, off
two years _ and the way in which it's constructed cannot pass,''
Mitchell said.
   Mitchell acknowledged that many Democrats favor enacting a
differential for taxing such profits at rates less than those for
wages, interest or dividends.
   ``Whether or not they will coalesce behind any plan along with
Republicans, I don't know,'' he said. ``It will be very close on
some other plan.''
   Regarding catastrophic health care, Mitchell said he is
confident the Senate will retain key benefits under the program,
although it may change how they are financed. The administration
has opposed changing or repealing the program.
   The wealthier among the 33 million elderly Americans covered by
the program have balked at having to pay premiums this year of up
to $800 to cover the hospital and physicians' bills for those with
lower incomes.
   Foley also said Congress likely will not complete action by an
Oct. 16 deadline on a deficit-reduction bill, which would include
any tax measure or changes in catastrophic care coverage.
   That is the date when broad spending cuts in both military and
domestic programs will be triggered automatically unless Congress
comes up with $6 billion in new revenues or programs for fiscal
1990.
   ``We might have some few days in which there would be a
technical sequestration, that is an across-the-board cutting
through executive order of all the accounts ...,'' Foley said. ``I
don't think that's going to be a permanent situation.''

<HEAD>House Members Doubt Senate Rationale on Star Wars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supporters of Star Wars believe the Senate
strengthened its hand in negotiations with the House by restoring
funds for the missile shield, but House members are casting doubt
on that rationale.
   The Senate slashed $900 million from President Bush's fiscal
1990 request of $4.9 billion for Star Wars last Tuesday, then came
back two days later and restored two-thirds of the money.
   What transpired in 48 hours were proclamations that the initial
vote signaled the demise of the program, formally known as the
Strategic Defense Initiative, introduced six years ago by President
Reagan as a nuclear-age antidote to a strike against the United
States.
   There also was a negotiating session between House and Senate
conferees thrashing out the defense authorization bill in which
confident House members argued that the true Senate Star Wars
number was the $3.7 billion adopted Tuesday in the appropriations
bill, not the $4.5 billion the Senate approved last month in
authorization legislation.
   The House, which had agreed to $3.1 billion for the program,
wanted a final figure closer to their total.
   Faced with that argument, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the
Armed Services Committee, took his case to the Senate for a
stronger negotiating position. He succeeded by a narrow margin,
53-47.
   Despite the win, lawmakers stressed that the House wouldn't be
fooled by the Senate reversal. Shortly after the second vote, some
Star Wars opponents said so in no uncertain terms.
   ``It tells you about the depth of their feelings,'' said Rep.
Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., a member of the House Armed Services
Committee and one of the conferees.
   ``Those kind of flip-flops don't make the Senate look very
serious,'' she added.
   But on Friday some senators argued that they did nothing to fool
the House.
   ``We're on record as supporting a higher number,'' said Sen.
Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., a member of the Armed Services Committee.
``The Senate signaled it did not want a significant cut.''
   He added: ``There's nothing for the House to see through.''
   While the authorizers enter their fifth week of negotiations on
their respective defense plans, the appropriators are scheduled to
begin in another two weeks.
   The House and Senate versions of the appropriations bills differ
greatly on the major strategic weapons such as Star Wars, the B-2
stealth bomber and land-based nuclear missiles. The two blueprints
also include different funding totals for the Marine Corps' V-22
Osprey, the vertical-takeoff plane, and the F-14D Tomcat jet
fighter.
   Bush had sought to cancel the two conventional programs.
   In addition, the House slashed $1.1 billion for the Advanced
Tactical Fighter plane while the Senate cut $1.8 billion earmarked
for the Trident 2 nuclear missile, the submarine-launched weapons
that has had two successive test failures.

<HEAD>Bank's Contractors Get Blindside Hit from IRS</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALINAS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of independent contractors for a
bank are being scrutinized by the Internal Revenue Service, which
thinks they earned thousands of dollars every time they washed a
window or turned a screw.
   A computer at Wells Fargo &amp; Co. multiplied the earnings of
contractors, maintenance workers, lawyers and other professionals
by 100 before passing the information on to the IRS, the Salinas
Californian reported in its editions Saturday.
   And the IRS, eager to collect Uncle Sam's cut of the phantom
windfall, has written to the contractors, demanding explanations
for the discrepancies between the Wells Fargo reports and the
recipients' 1987 tax returns.
   ``I was panicked. They moved the decimal point two places to the
right,'' said real estate appraiser Harold M. Samuelson. ``They're
in quite a snit about it.''
   Samuelson, who says he made $2,400 from Wells Fargo, was listed
in IRS files as earning $240,000.
   There could be hundreds of such errors, said Cheryl Mortimer,
Wells Fargo spokeswoman. The bank acknowledged the number may be
higher but said the most people who could be listed wrongly would
be 25,000 _ the capacity of the suspect computer.
   ``It probably shook a lot of people up,'' said Russell Koch,
Samuelson's tax adviser, who has discussed the error with Wells
Fargo officials.
   The San Francisco-based bank, with 640 branches throughout the
state, hires about 2 million people each year on a contract basis,
said spokesman Kim Kellog.
   The inflated income reports have been tentatively traced to one
of Wells Fargo's many computers that handle IRS Form 1099, which is
submitted for all non-employees who perform more than $600 worth of
work for the company. The cause of the malfunction remains unknown.
   Koch said taxpayers called to account for non-existent income
should be able to prove the bank's figures were inaccurate but
could face a large amount of paperwork.
   But IRS spokesman Larry Wright said that any problems in setting
the record straight should be minimal.
   ``It's just a couple of additional zeroes,'' he said. ``It's not
a problem for the taxpayer. We send out hundreds of thousands of
letters like those, and it's not unusual to have some problems.''

said. Two others were injured.
   The driver, whose name was being withheld, apparently hit the

carrying five people from Hanover, Pa.
   Four of the five were killed, along with both occupants of the
sports car. The remaining passenger from the station wagon and one
motorcyclist were taken to a Baltimore hospital. Police said they
did not have a report on the other motorcyclist.
   State police said excessive speed and alcohol contributed to the
accident.
   The four victims from the station wagon were identified as

Oppedal, 12; and Jessica Pourchier, 13, a neighbor. Oppedal's wife,
Nancy Oppedal, 42, was listed in critical condition. The
motorcyclist, Wayne Schultz, 30, was in serious condition after
doctors removed his left leg.

<TEXT>
   Nearly 500 couples who thought they had
been divorced for years will find out they failed to finish what
they started.
   The Orange County Superior Court Clerk's office discovered the
incomplete cases, some as old as a decade, during a purge last
month of old files.
   Judges and clerks said the legal lapses came about in most cases
because couples or their lawyers simply neglected to file final
divorce papers.
   ``What if one of us just won the $50 million lottery and thought
we were divorced?'' asked Hank Roed, 52, who recently found out he
still was married to Stephanie Ferguson. He thought they were
divorced in 1983. ``There would be a big financial situation.''
   Others who remarried have to legalize their current marriage by
filing the missing divorce documents, officials said. In most
cases, a judge will then approve the filing.
   Court clerks were preparing to send out notices to the couples
involved in the unresolved cases.

<HEAD>More Children Locked in Poverty, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Millions of children, particularly blacks and
Hispanics, are being launched on ``courses of failure'' because
they live in poverty, says a congressional report that warns there
appears little prospect for improvement.
   Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., said the report released Sunday
paints a ``disturbing'' portrait of American children, many of whom
never benefited from the economic expansion of the 1980s under the
Reagan administration.
   ``We're launching millions of children on courses of failure,''
said Miller, who heads a committee on families.
   Most disturbing, he said, is that ``I really see very little
that holds out the prospect that this will change. ... The prospect
is that those incomes are going to stagnate.''
   Neither the White House nor Congress has been willing to put
enough resources into social programs to give families the support
they need so children can grow up well-fed, healthy and educated
enough to participate in the economy, he said.
   However, Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va., ranking Republican on the
panel, took issue with the chairman's conclusion that the federal
government, under a Republican president, has ignored the problem.
   Bliley said the net that is keeping so many children in poverty
was not cast by Reagan but is the result of social forces that are
breaking up families and sexual behaviors that are leading more
girls to become teenage mothers.
   ``We have known for two decades that single parenthood is a
prescription for poverty, regardless of race,'' Bliley said. ``How
you solve these problems I really don't know.''
   Bliley agreed with Miller that Congress was not likely to vote
more money for social programs overall.
   ``You can always use more money, but I don't see it there with
the budget crunch we're in,'' he said.
   The 300-page report by the House Select Committee on Children,
Youth and Families compiles statistics from a variety of sources.
   The figures show that children are the poorest segment of the
U.S. population. In 1987, nearly 21 percent of children under age
18 and more than 22 percent of children under age 6 lived in
families with incomes below the poverty line, compared with 12
percent of the elderly and 14 percent of people of all ages.
   The childhood poverty rate rose from 15 percent in 1970 to more
than 18 percent in 1980 and more than 22 percent in 1983 before
dropping to 20.5 percent in 1986.
   Poverty has been more persistent for black and Hispanic
children, for whom the rates have risen since 1970. In 1987, more
than 48 percent of black children and nearly 42 percent of Hispanic
children lived in poverty.
   In 1988, 71 percent of children were living with two parents,
while about 24 percent were living with only their mother or
father. In 1981, about 74 percent were living with both parents and
about 20 percent were living with a single parent.
   About 42 percent of children in 1986 were living with two
working parents, while 29 percent were in two-parent families where
only the father worked. About 15 percent lived with one parent who
was in the labor force and about 8 percent were in single-parent
homes where the parent was unemployed.

<TEXT>
   There's a body, evidence, and a
suspect. But Arkansas and Tennessee authorities can't agree who
should investigate the death of a former women's collegiate
basketball star.
   The body of Joel Tillis, who played basketball at Northeast
Louisiana University, was found June 11 in a ditch near Forrest
City, about 25 miles from the state line. But she may have died in
Memphis.
   ``I'm wondering if they are thinking of her as a nobody,'' said
Marliss Bates of Hammond, La., who last saw her daughter when she
came home for Mother's Day.
   ``Had Joel been some prominent person's daughter ... would it
have made a difference then? Was Joel just another black child?''
   Authorities in St. Francis County, Ark., contend Ms. Tillis, 24,
was slain in a Memphis apartment and her body then dumped in the
ditch beside U.S. 70, halfway between Forrest City and Memphis.
   ``We have simply pursued all the leads that we have, and
everything to us points back to Memphis, Tennessee,'' said Sheriff
Dave Parkman, who forwarded the case file to police in the
Tennessee city in August. ``We just cannot resolve a murder here in
this county that happened someplace else.''
   But Capt. Ken East, commander of the Memphis homicide division,
said he isn't about to take over the investigation.
   ``It is his case, it has been his case and it will continue to
be his case,'' East said. ``Unless it can be proved that a homicide
occurred here, which it cannot be proved at this time, then it
stays where it is found.''
   The discovery of Ms. Tillis' badly decomposed body came a little
more than two years after the body of her best friend and former
teammate, 18-year-old Brenda Spicer, was found in a trash bin on
the Monroe, La., college campus. Both women were strangled.
   Ms. Tillis' boyfriend, Ivrin Bolden, who shared a Memphis
apartment with her until her disappearance in May, is a prime
suspect in the Tillis case, Parkman said.
   Bolden was acquitted of second-degree murder in the 1987 death
of Ms. Spicer, with Ms. Tillis testifying on his behalf.
   On May 19, he reported to Memphis police that Ms. Tillis was
missing and that he last saw her the previous day, when he dropped
her off for work as an assistant manager at a Lady Foot Locker shoe
store.
   But Ms. Tillis' boss told police the young woman never showed up
for work that day.
   Shortly after Ms. Tillis' disappearance, Bolden was questioned
by Memphis police, but he since has left Tennessee and was last
reported living in Florida.
   Parkman said investigators have learned Ms. Tillis and Bolden
argued the day she disappeared. But Parkman said he never
questioned Bolden.
   ``I think Bolden should be interviewed,'' Parkman said. ``But I
don't think we have enough to do that in this county. I don't think
we have enough evidence and information on Bolden to initiate
picking him up.''
   Bolden declined comment recently, saying, ``I know my name is
being bounced around a lot up there, but my attorney has advised me
not to say anything.''
   St. Francis County officials know Ms. Tillis was dead when her
body was dumped in the ditch, Parkman said. They also have learned
Bolden and Ms. Tillis owned rose-colored sheets like the ones found
wrapped around her body, and crime lab reports indicate fibers
found on the sheets and on Ms. Tillis' clothing matched carpet
fibers in the Memphis apartment, Parkman said.
   Parkman also said police have established a motive, but he would
not disclose it.
   Memphis chief of detectives Fred Warner said his department
won't take the case unless there's conclusive evidence the crime
occurred in Memphis.
   He denied the mother's implication that authorities are dragging
their feet because Ms. Tillis was black. Ninety percent of the
people killed in Memphis this year were black, Warner said, and
91.8 percent of homicides were solved.

   This battered city paused from cleanup
labors Sunday to thank the volunteers from all over the country who
answered the call for help in the recovery from Hurricane Hugo.
   ``What you're doing will never be forgotten,'' Mayor Joseph
Riley told several hundred weary workers who gathered at a noon
rally. ``People from all over the country came to help a community
in need. We might have suffered some damage, but our spirit is
alive.''
   The mayor read several letters of support from children and
other well-wishers from across the land. One envelope from former
President Reagan included a check from $1,000.
   Officials said 63 buildings collapsed in the historic city when
Hugo crashed ashore and more than 350 were severely damaged by the
hurricane's 135 mph wind.
   Volunteers flooded into town to remove trees, clear debris and
pitch in to help people in need.
   Sen. Fritz Hollings, D-S.C., an outspoken critic of the response
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, praised the volunteer
laborers for their efforts.
   ``They didn't wait to fill out a form like the bureaucrats in
the federal government ask you to. They came up here free of charge
and volunteered,'' said Hollings, wearing a T-shirt that read:
``Charleston, S.C., We're Going Strong!''
   ``This country's great if we can get the federal government off
its duff,'' he said. ``We're going back to work to get around the
bureaucratic snarl.''
   Mark Chambers, a spokesman for Gov. Carroll Campbell, defended
FEMA's efforts Sunday.
   ``FEMA is providing everything the state of South Carolina
needs. We're talking about one of the most devastating storms in
recent history. It's being done,'' he said.
   However, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, a native of South Carolina,
joined critics of FEMA's effort. ``People do not need more
bureaucracy _ they need more direct help right now,'' he said.
   The volunteers were treated to a hot lunch of stir-fried chicken
dished up by the Outer Banks Rotary Club from North Carolina.
   A canvas canopy donated by the Sturh Funeral Home protected the
food from an intermittent drizzle. But it was more like a revival
than a funeral and at one point volunteers standing in mud sang
``God Bless America'' over the hum of portable generators.
   Steve Desin, 45, of Vallejo, Calif., arrived Wednesday after 187
days working on the Alaskan oil spill in Valdez, Alaska. His
company, Cheetah Aviation Transport Service, sent four large
vessels to ferry food, clothing and medicine to people on the
offshore barrier islands pummeled by Hugo.
   ``These people need help,'' said Desin. ``This is what makes
this country what it is. You can kick our butts, but we'll fight
back.''
   Fayetteville, N.C., sent 19 police officers to help Charleston
with traffic and curfew control.
   ``These people have been kicked in the teeth. Wouldn't you help
someone where they're down?'' said Capt. L.E. Morgan of the
Cumberland County, N.C., Sheriff's Department.
   Fort Lauderdale, Fla., sent 28 men plus a squadron of trucks,
backhoes and heavy equipment.
   ``The hurricane could have hit us,'' said Tom Carbone, 33.
``This country's always sending help to other countries. This is a
way to help our own.''
   Elsewhere Sunday, in South Carolina's upstate region, heavy rain
overflowed already swollen rivers and closed some roads.
   Ten FEMA disaster application centers were open Sunday, with
four more scheduled to open Monday, officials said. As of Sunday,
5,400 residents had applied for various forms of federal and state
assistance.
   Seventeen counties issued food stamps to people who suffered
property damage or income losses. Officials said Saturday that $10
million in food stamps had been issued to more than 50,000
residents since Thursday. Normally, South Carolina issues $13
million in food stamps over an entire month.
   In Bishopville, three National Guardsmen had to be sent in to
restore order when pushing and shouting broke out among people who
had been waiting for hours in a food stamp line. No arrests were
made, officials said.

   It took Hurricane Hugo six hours to roar
across South Carolina, lashing the state with wind, rain and flood.
Officials ending a week of cleanup say those few hours will be felt
for years.
   The storm smashed the state's economy, throwing thousands out of
work. It devastated timberlands, farmlands and coastal areas,
damaging everything from tourist havens to shrimp beds. The genteel
face of Charleston has been scarred and muddied.
   ``It's not going to be a quick process, it is going to be hard
for all of us,'' said Joseph P. Riley Jr., the mayor of Charleston,
where more than 2,500 historically significant buildings were
damaged. The repairs to those building will take five years.
   The immediate effects are obvious. Eleven days after South
Carolina bore the brunt of the storm, thousands of people remain
without electricity, and an estimated 50,000 are homeless.
   Cleanup efforts are costing the state a half-million dollars
daily. State Comptroller General Earle Morris has estimated Hugo
could put the state budget $300 million in the red in the next
fiscal year, partly due to losses in revenue from fallen payroll
and property taxes.
   Hugo's 135 mph winds and 17-foot tidal surge also altered the
state's employment picture. An estimated 270,000 people were thrown
out of work for at least the short term, raising the state's
normally low unemployment rate of 4.5 percent to more than 16
percent.
   ``It's across the board,'' said Jack Philips, a program
supervisor with the state Employment Security Commission. ``We have
everything from manufacturing plants to hardware stores affected.
The weather doesn't discriminate.''
   Philips said it was hoped many shops and businesses would reopen
soon, but the state's important lumber and fishing industries may
take three years to recover.
   Dozens of shrimp boats were beached and damaged by the storm,
which struck during one of the best harvests in recent years. State
officials say shrimp beds appear to have escaped major damage, but
producers were hit hard.
   ``The biggest thing is people who buy the shrimp _ the packing
houses _ they're all wiped out,'' said Jimmy Scott, a
McClellanville shrimper for 21 years.
   Of greater concern is the damage to forests, which provide the
raw materials for a $4.3 billion wood products industry that
employs 30,000 people.
   It is estimated 36 percent of the 12.2 million acres of state
forest was damaged, felling trees worth more than $1 billion.
   Put in perspective, about 2.2 billion board feet of timber are
harvested annually. Hugo's destruction downed 6.7 billion board
feet.
   ``We hope to salvage what we can, but there's three years of
harvest on the ground,'' said Steve Scott, a state forester. ``We
see a major reforestation problem. After all, how do you get that
many acres back in production?''
   The tourist industry, a $4 billion business that employs 98,000
people, is expected to bounce back quickly despite $2 billion in
damage. But Robert Liming, state director of tourism, said damage
to such resorts as Myrtle Beach and Garden City would drop growth
from an anticipated 8 percent to less than 3 percent this year.
   Liming said key to bringing tourists back is a quick rebuilding
program to dispel notions that the coast remains in tatters.
   ``Some people are assuming that Myrtle Beach is gone and that's
a wrong assumption,'' he said. ``A remarkable amount of property
has already gotten back on line, but some heavy rental areas are
going to be a long time coming back.''
   The storm laid waste to as much as $100 million worth of cotton,
soybean, corn and tobacco in the major agriculture areas in the
Savannah Valley and the northeast part of the state.
   While the damage will be gone with next year's row crops, Dan
Smith, a Clemson agricultural economist, said the effects will take
its toll on those who raise poultry, hogs and dairy cattle.
   ``Those losses will be much greater,'' he said. ``We're talking
about a longer term recovery period that will see some farmers sell
out.''
   Perhaps most worrisome is Hugo's impact on the state's small
businesses: the restaurants, shops and small manufacturers without
the resources to survive weeks and months of down time.
   ``The number of businesses coming into the disaster assistance
centers is far greater than we expected,'' said John Patrick,
district director of the U.S. Small Business Administration. ``We
will probably be seeing effects of this for the next 10 years.''
   Nelson Bean, president of Evans American Corp., a Houston-based
company specializing in catastrophe management, said the longer it
takes businesses to get on their feet, the greater the risk they
face of closing.
   ``Probably 40 percent of businesses won't reopen,'' he said.
``That's pretty significant when you consider that these are
largely mom and pop operations that have been in business for years
and years.''

   Manuel J. Clouthier, who as a candidate in
the 1988 presidential election brought conservative ideas back to
Mexican politics, died in an auto accident in his native Sinaloa
state. He was 55.
   Thousands of supporters marched through the streets of the state
capital, Culiacan, late Sunday carrying the blue-and-white flags of
his National Action Party with a black-bow ribbon sewed on one
corner as a sign of mourning.
   In Mexico City, about 200 supporters gathered around the Angel
of Independence monument holding signs that read, ``Thank you,
Maquio,'' Clouthier's nickname.
   Clouthier and political colleague Javier Calvo Manriquez died
Sunday when the car they were in crashed head on into a truck
loaded with papayas, police said.
   The accident occurred halfway between Culiacan and the Pacific
beach resort of Mazatlan. A police news bulletin said the driver of
the truck, Aurelio Flores Gomez, was detained for questioning.
   When he died, Clouthier was stumping the state to help National
Action mayoral candidates running in Oct. 15 balloting.
   Friends, political foes and former business associates mourned
the burly, white-bearded politician who finished third in Mexico's
1988 election, which was won by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari
and marred by fraud.
   Salinas, on a one-week visit to the United States, telephoned
his condolences to National Action Party leaders, the government
news agency Notimex said.
   Rosario Ibarra de Piedra, a leading human rights activist,
called Clouthier's death ``a great loss for the political fight in
Mexico.''
   ``He was a strong, courageous man of very defined political
ideology. But I learned to appreciate him as a Mexican struggling
to open the way of democracy for the Mexican people,'' Heberto
Castillo, a socialist political foe, told reporters.
   Clouthier gained wide popularity after the 1988 campaign for his
denunciations of election fraud and criticisms of the centrist
Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has held power in Mexico
since its founding in 1929.
   Conservative politics had been frowned upon since the overthrow
of dictator Porfirio Diaz in the Mexican Revolution.
   Conservative parties like National Action were discredited until
Clouthier, angered by former President Jose Lopez Portillo's
expropriation of private banks in 1982, entered politics.
   ``Lopez Portillo turned me into a politician when he did that. I
saw the power and the rigidity of the presidential system and I
decided to struggle to change that,'' a friend quoted Clouthier as
saying.
   Clouthier sold most of his investments in industrial companies
and dedicated himself to truck farming and politics.
   He managed to unify his fractious party into a political force
and rally Mexico's splintered conservatives. He ran for Sinaloa
governor in 1986 but lost to the governing party candidate in
balloting also allegedly marred by fraud.
   Clouthier, whose family has lived in Sinaloa for more than a
century, was born in Culiacan on June 13, 1934. An agricultural
engineer by profession, he headed leading business organizations
for more than two decades.
   Clouthier studied at the Technological Institute of Monterrey,
graduating with a degree in agronomy and botany. He taught biology
at the University of Sinaloa.
   He is survived by his wife, Leticia Carrillo de Clouthier, and
their 10 children.

<HEAD>Priest Defies Archbishop Over Dress Code for Church</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A priest has told parishioners he won't back
down from enforcing a dress code despite orders from the
archdiocese that communion is for anyone, even those who wear
shorts to services.
   Some people among the 80-member congregation are rallying behind
the Rev. Roger Griese, who has preached at Roman Catholic Sacred
Heart Church for 21 years.
   ``I don't think there is one person in our congregation that
doesn't go along with a person going to church ... looking like a
person going to church,'' said Toni Bertran, 61.
   Church officials said that while dress codes are permissable, it
is the practice of the church worldwide not to deny communion on
the basis of dress.
   For about 20 years, the parish has had a dress code that bans
shorts, miniskirts and halter tops. This summer, Griese posted
signs throughout the church as a reminder.
   Ms. Bertran said the rules have been bent for people who can't
afford dress clothes.
   ``We don't mind polo shirts, because sometimes that's all
they've got,'' she said.
   ``By and large it seems that the atmosphere of the parish seems
to be very supportive of father,'' said David Acanfora, an
occasional churchgoer. ``I certainly am.''
   Others, however, oppose the dress code.
   ``No one should be denied communion,'' said Nancy Sexton, 54,
who attends the church but is not a member. ``If he denies
communion to people, how do we know if we're going to be denied the
last sacrament when we die? I think the church should be more
interested in saving souls than how people dress.''
   James Garvey, 33, was turned away by Griese twice on consecutive
Sundays in September when he came to church wearing shorts. The
next Sunday, Griese served him communion after Garvey appeared in
trousers and a dress shirt.
   ``It is people like him across this world that drive Catholics
away from the Catholic Church,'' Garvey said. ``My faith was taken
away from me by not giving me communion for two Sundays in a row
for wearing shorts. ... That tells me he's judging me based on what
I wear.''
   Elizabeth Corrado, 20, said she learned of Griese's enforcement
of the code in July when she and a boy friend went to Mass. She
said she was wearing knee-length black shorts and a silk blouse
with a collar. Her boy friend was wearing shorts.
   ``In front of the entire church, he says, `Get out of my church.
You're not welcomed here,''' Ms. Corrado said. ``I couldn't believe
he was saying this. Of course, everybody was staring at us.''
   The couple left.
   Archbishop Daniel Pilarczyk, whose Cincinnati-based archdiocese
includes the church, wrote Griese in September that the code should
not be enforced to the extent of refusing communion.
   ``I have indicated this to you and pointed out that in the
future you may not refuse Holy Communion or absolution in the
Sacrament of Penance purely on the grounds of inappropriate
dress,'' Pilarczyk wrote.
   Ray George, an archdiocese spokesman, declined to say what
sanctions Griese might face if he continues to refuse communion to
shabby dressers.
   Griese, 73, told his congregration last month he had been
threatened with suspension but wouldn't back down.
   ``I'm at peace with God as to what I've done and how I've done
it,'' Griese said. ``And if that doesn't please the archbishop,
then I'm very sorry. But I have to follow my conscience.''
   He did not return phone calls to The Associated Press.
   Ms. Bertran said Griese's manner of enforcing the dress code is
part of his ``abrupt'' manner.
   ``That's his personality,'' she said. ``You have to understand
father, and if you were a parishioner you would know that.''

<TEXT>
   A man on the FBI's most wanted list for
three drug-related slayings was arrested after a viewer of the
television program ``America's Most Wanted'' tipped authorities,
the agency said.
   Pedro Luis Estrada, 25, was arrested Sunday afternoon as he
stepped from his house for his daily bicycle ride, said Wayne R.
Gilbert, special agent in charge of the Philadelphia FBI office.
   Estrada was ordered held without bail pending an arraignment in
Harrisburg today.
   Authorities said Estrada was a drug gang enforcer and that the
June 15, 1986, slayings were revenge shootings. Two victims were
bound by the hands and shot execution style in the throat, said
Gilbert.
   A fourth intended victim survived the Bronx attack and
identified Estrada as one of her assailants, authorities said.
   Estrada also was involved in the Aug. 16, 1986, slayings of a
suspected drug dealer and a 17-year-old bystander, authorities said.
   He was placed on the FBI's list of 10 most wanted fugitives
after dropping from sight on Nov. 21, 1986.
   Before he got involved with drugs, Estrada was a licensed boxer
in New York, the FBI said. His last professional fight was in 1984.
   Gilbert said the FBI received several tips about Estrada's
whereabouts after ``America's Most Wanted'' broadcast a segment on
the fugitive in February 1988. A tip received Thursday led to the
arrest, Gilbert said.
   ``That verified that we were on the right track,'' said David J.
Malarney, senior resident agent for the FBI's Harrisburg office.

   This Media General-Associated Press poll is
based on telephone interviews Sept. 14-24 with 1,071 adults in the
continental United States.
   Phone numbers were selected randomly and interviews were
conducted with the adult who had the most recent birthday.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the
sample. The poll has a 3-point margin of error, meaning that 19 of
20 times its findings should be within 3 points of the result if
every adult American were asked the same questions. The error
margin is larger for subgroups.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions in this
poll; because of rounding, sums may not total 100:
   1. What do you think is the most important problem facing this
country today? Drugs: 61 percent. Federal deficit: 5 percent.

percent. Other answers: 22 percent. Don't know or no answer: 2
percent.
   2. (If ``drugs'') Do you think that problem will get better or
worse in the next 10 years, or stay about the same? Better: 36.
Worse: 44. Same: 14. DK-NA: 5.
   3. Please tell me if each of the following is objectionable to
you, or not:
   a. Someone growing marijuana for their own use and smoking it at
home. Objectionable: 73. Not objectionable: 26. DK-NA: 1.
   b. Someone buying marijuana and smoking it at home.
Objectionable: 83. Not objectionable: 16. DK-NA: 2.
   c. Someone selling marijuana. Objectionable: 92. Not

96. Not objectionable: 4. DK-NA: 1.
   e. Someone selling cocaine. Objectionable: 97. Not
objectionable: 3. DK-NA: 1.
   4. In your opinion, how much of a problem is illegal drug use in
your neighborhood _ very serious, somewhat serious, not too serious

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amin Fayyad has repaired his
shell-battered west Beirut pharmacy but hasn't removed the
sandbags, reflecting the skepticism most Lebanese feel about peace
talks under way in Saudi Arabia.
   ``I'm back in business,'' Fayyad, a Druse Moslem, said Sunday.
``But I have no faith in the ability of those people in Saudi
Arabia.''
   An Arab League-brokered cease-fire that ended six months of
remorseless shelling battles between Christian and Syrian forces
has held for eight days.
   But the daily crackle of automatic weapons along Beirut's
dividing Green Line, a daily ritual for so many years no one
considers it a violation, is a reminder of how volatile Lebanon is.
   Many Lebanese, who have seen hundreds of cease-fires collapse
since the civil war began in 1975, consider this one nothing more
than a respite in a conflict that has defied the peacemakers.
   Peace, they believe, is still far off.
   Simon Hajj, a Christian taxi driver in east Beirut, does not
believe the aging Lebanese legislators trying to hammer out a
settlement in the Saudi Arabian resort of Taif will be able to come
up with the magic formula that has eluded everyone else.
   Quoting an Arabic saying, he said ``they're just cooking a stone
soup _ It's something that can't be cooked.''
   Hajj, 38, said: ``These people have been members of parliament
since 1972 and they haven't been able to do anything to stop the
war. Why should we expect them to be magicians now?''
   ``The best we can hope for from the Taif talks is an agreement
on vaguely worded general principles,'' said columnist Emile
Khoury, a Maronite Catholic who writes for the respected
independent An-Nahar daily based in Moslem west Beirut.
   ``Parliamentary subcommittees will be set up to negotiate the
details and mechanisms to translate these general principles into
reality, a process which will take many, many months,'' he said.
   Even then, many Lebanese believe, there are too many fighters
with a vested interest in perpetuating the conflict to make a final
settlement attainable.
   Although Parliament is one of the few constitutional
institutions to have surivived the civil war there is a general
consensus that it is helpless to influence the warlords and foreign
powers who have kept the war going.
   ``These men have no influence at all on the gunmen who fought
the war,'' said Mustafa Koosh, 38, a Sunni Moslem and professional
wrestler.
   The current parliament was elected for a four-year term in 1972,
three years before the war broke out.
   The fighting prevented general elections and the legislators in
the 99-seat House have simply voted themselves a new mandate
periodically since then.
   The main Moslem and Christian militias, who have accrued wide
power during the fighting that has fragmented Lebanon into
sectarian cantons, as well as the splintered Lebanese army, have no
representatives among the 73 surviving Parliament members, many of
whom are in their 70s.
   Moslem militia chieftains like Walid Jumblatt of the Druse
Progressive Socialist Party, and Nabih Berri of the Shiite Amal
movement, both have denounced the political reforms being debated
in Taif as meaningless.
   ``If Jumblatt or Berri veto any resolutions taken in Taif, who's
going to be able to implement them?'' Koosh asked.
   Many people believe Parliament is incapable of disbanding the
militias, a move essential to ending the war.
   Yet despite the gloom, many Beirutis say they will use the
current lull to get their businesses going again after the six
months of shelling, some of the fiercest of the war.
   ``I'm going to repair my shop and resume business and I hope
this lull lasts long enough for me to make up my losses,'' said
Pierre Shahine, whose electrical tools shop in east Beirut's
low-income Dora district was gutted.
   The Lebanese despair is rooted in the failure of every peace
effort that has been made, in too many years of fighting that has
killed more than 150,000 people, displaced another 1 million and
ruined the economy.
   But there are some optimists.
   They pin their hopes on the prestige of King Fahd of Saudi
Arabia, one of the main driving forces behind the peace initiative,
and the negotiating skills of senior aides to King Hassan II of
Morocco and President Chadli Bendjedid of Algeria.
   The three heads of state make up a mediation committee formed by
an Arab summit in Morocco in May.
   ``The committee must have gotten solid assurance of cooperation
from Syria, otherwise it wouldn't have flown the Lebanese
parliamentary deputies to Taif to discuss a settlement,'' said
Samir Honein, a Christian civil defense volunteer.
   He contended that Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, can
easily prevail on Jumblatt and Berri to go along with any
compromise reached in Taif and that Christian leader Gen. Michel
Aoun cannot dissent without becoming an outcast in the Arab world.

   A bomb exploded outside the
police station of a small town 20 miles northwest of Belfast,
heavily damaging the town center and slightly injuring three
people, police said.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility for the blast late
Sunday in Randalstown, but suspicion inevitably fell on the Irish
Republican Army, which is fighting British rule in Northern Ireland.
   Belfast police headquarters said in a statement that the injured
were two civilians and a police officer.
   Police said the bomb exploded as police officers were evacuating
scores of families from their homes in the area following a
telephoned warning by an anonymous caller.
   They said the attackers put the 500-pound bomb in a hijacked
van, then left the vehicle outside the police station, which like
many police stations in Northern Ireland is fortified against bomb
attacks and manned only part-time.
   The building, unoccupied at the time, was extensively damaged
while dozens of nearby homes, shops and offices were wrecked,
police said.
   They said only the prompt action of the security forces in
evacuating homes had prevented a major disaster.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA wants to unite the predominantly
Protestant province with the mainly Catholic Republic of Ireland
under socialist rule.

<HEAD>Americans Back Tax Hike to Help War on Drugs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans overwhelmingly favor an increase in
``sin taxes'' to help fund President Bush's war on drugs, according
to a Media General-Associated Press poll.
   The poll also found that many preferred treatment of drug users
to punishment, and expressed doubt that more prisons will help.
   And many doubted Bush's plan will succeed: Among the 61 percent
who called drug abuse the nation's most important problem, barely
more than a third expected the problem to ease during the next
decade.
   Nearly one-third of all respondents knew someone who uses
cocaine. But most said drug abuse is not a serious problem in their
own neighborhoods, and just one-seventh rated it ``very serious''
where they live.
   The poll, conducted Sept. 14-24 among 1,071 Americans, had a
margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
   Bush has proposed a $7.9 billion program to fight illegal drugs,
saying they are ``sapping our strength as a nation.'' Seventy
percent of the money is earmarked for law enforcement, the rest for
education and treatment.
   In the poll, though, six in 10 said providing treatment for drug
users would accomplish more than punishing them. And 57 percent
said building more federal prison cells for drug offenders _ as
Bush wants _ won't help.
   Sixty-five percent believed boosting military and
law-enforcement aid to cocaine-exporting countries would help
reduce drug abuse. But the highest levels of support were for
greater federal spending on drug treatment, with 80 percent in
favor, and education, with 91 percent in favor.
   Respondents were split on whether Bush's plan spends enough
money, too little or too much. Nearly half wanted anti-drug money
taken from other programs, while a third favored raising taxes. The
rest were unsure.
   Though taxes were generally unpopular, three-quarters said they
would support raising cigarette or alcoholic beverage taxes to pay
for a bigger drug program, and seven in 10 supported a 1 percent
increase in corporate income taxes.
   Another funding scheme had less support: By 53-43 percent,
respondents opposed a 1 percent increase in personal income taxes.
   The number of people calling drug abuse the nation's greatest
problem has risen steadily in opinion polls as the issue gained
increasing attention. While most rank it the No. 1 problem
nationally, however, just 14 percent reported a ``very serious''
drug problem where they live.
   An additional 26 percent rated the problem ``somewhat serious''
in their neighborhoods. The larger share _ about six in 10 _ rated
their local drug problem as ``not too'' or ``not at all'' serious.
   Big-city dwellers were most concerned, with half saying illegal
drugs posed a serious problem in their neighborhoods.
   The National Institute on Drug Abuse has estimated that roughly
8 million Americans have used cocaine during the past year and 1
million of them use it at least once a week. In the Media
General-AP survey, 31 percent said they know someone who uses
cocaine or its derivative, crack. Half of them, or about
one-seventh of all respondents, said they know an addict.
   Younger people were more likely to know a cocaine user; 48
percent of those age 18-29 said they did. Black respondents and
big-city residents also were more likely to know a cocaine user.
   Bush last month called on Americans who know drug abusers to
help them stop. But the poll showed the difficulty of that
approach: Of those who knew current cocaine users, nearly six in 10
said they already have tried to get them off drugs.
   The poll found overwhelming objection to buying or selling
marijuana or cocaine. The greatest tolerance was for growing
marijuana for personal use, which 26 percent called unobjectionable.
   Respondents split sharply on law enforcement priorities,
dividing about evenly on whether the best line of attack is against
drug producers, dealers or users.
   They favored some new punishment schemes for occasional users,
with 82 percent saying people caught with drugs in their cars
should have their licenses suspended and 63 percent saying the cars
should be confiscated.
   People were split about evenly on the notion of sending
occasional drug users to military-style boot camps as punishment.
   Eight in 10 said Bush should order the U.S. armed forces to
patrol the borders for smugglers. But only 43 percent said he
should order military strikes against illegal drug operations in
foreign countries.

   The U.S. dollar ended marginally lower against the
Japanese yen at the end of Monday trading, while the key index on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange erased earlier gains and inched down.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues lost 13.79
points, or 0.04 percent, ending at 35,622.97. It shed 53.22 points
on Friday.
   Dealers said the index rose earlier when market players were
reassured by Liberal Democratic Party candidate Itsuo Nomura's
victory over his Socialist rival in a by-election for a seat in the
less-powerful upper house of Parliament Sunday.
   However, the index started falling as participants sold issues
for profit-taking, partly fearful of the recent rapid rise in share
prices, they said.
   In currency dealings, the dollar ended at 139.30 yen, down 0.05
yen from last Friday's close of 139.35 yen. It opened lower at
138.77 yen, and moved between 138.65 yen and 139.48 yen.
   The dollar passed the 139-yen mark shortly after the market
opened, as participants bought the currency for profit-taking, but
trading became mixed afterwards, traders said.
   The dollar's downtrend was further prompted by the the governing
party's victory in the by-election and dollar-selling by the U.S.
Federal Reserve Board last week, said one trader with a major
commercial Japanese bank in Tokyo who spoke on condition of
anonymity.

   It was a sight that would have impressed Noah,
though this procession was one-by-one, not two-by-two.
   First came Mini, an 8,000-pound elephant, followed by a skittish
llama, ponies, baby African pigmy goats, a chimpanzee named Casey,
an owl, thousands of bees, a 3-foot lizard, a bowl of algae, and
even a rat.
   This was no marching zoo, but the Fifth Annual Feast of St.
Francis of Assisi at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine,
where about 6,000 people came Sunday to have their pets blessed and
to celebrate ``the beauty of God's sacred creation.''
   ``Women, men, boys, girls and animals _ it's a great day,''
announced the Rt. Rev. Paul Moore Jr., 13th bishop of the Episcopal
church, at the start of his sermon.
   Most brought dogs _ of every imaginable shape, size and color.
The stars were the animals in the procession. They slowly came up
the aisle and gathered around the altar.
   The elephant snorted. A camel surveyed the scene with his
drooping eyes. Goats baaaaahed. A parrot screeched. A shy
chimpanzee clutched her owner tightly. Francis, the pet rat,
twitched and sniffed.
   ``He was very brave, I think the church had a calming affect on
him,'' said the rat's owner, who indentified herself only as
Susanne. ``He sat next to the owl and had a great time.''
   Peter Brandon was proud of his emerald winged macaw after the
procession.
   ``He was good this year. He didn't say anything. Last year, we
were up on the altar near a microphone and he suddenly screeched
out `Come on! Let's go!'''

   The Baltimore Orioles didn't quite make history
as the first big-league ball club to climb from the cellar to the
top in one season, but that didn't bother the thousands of fans who
welcomed them home in rain.
   ``I can't imagine what it would have been like if it had been a
dry day or if we'd actually won it,'' pitcher Dave Johnson said
after Sunday's airport rally.
   The team arrived from Toronto, where the Blue Jays on Saturday
ended the Orioles' hopes of winning the American League East title.
The battle of the birds ended with the Orioles two games behind.
   A parade was scheduled for today.
   Manager Frank Robinson thanked the crowd with a joke:
   ``In 1982 in San Francisco, we finished two games out and they
gave me 24 hours to get out of town,'' said Robinson, a former
Giants manager. ``Here, we finish two games out and we get pep
rally and a parade.''

   A young East German woman screamed,
``We made it, we made it,'' as she sobbed with happiness, squeezed
into a throng of hundreds of other refugees arriving in this
northern Bavarian city.
   The refugees, many with small children in tow, looked tired but
still showed nearly unbounded joy as crowds of West Germans
welcomed them after their overnight journey to the West.
   Elke Ebecke, her 12-year-old son Thomas and 3-year-old daughter
Christine, tried to push through the refugees and well-wishers on
the train platform.
   ``My husband managed to make it across through Hungary three
weeks ago, but we didn't go,'' the 32-year-old woman said, her eyes
wet with tears.
   Mrs. Ebecke, from the Leipzig area, was on the second train
packed with East German refugees that arrived from Prague,
Czechoslovakia.
   ``My husband doesn't even know we're here yet,'' she said.
   Annamarie Lenz, 52, told of how Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher of West Germany announced late Saturday to refugees at
Bonn's embassy in Prague that they would be permitted to go West.
   ``I was just walking by in the embassy garden when he said it.
Such a cheer went up from all the people. It was unbelievable,''
she said. ``I had applied three times in two years to leave for the
West, but they turned me down each time. I went to Prague, because
I thought this was my only chance.''
   The refugees formed long lines at public telephones in the train
station to call families in East Germany or relatives in the West.
   Outside the station, many refugees picked out donated clothing
stacked high on yellow railway carts. Most had arrived with just
one or two canvas bags packed with their belongings.
   Red Cross, police and railway workers mingled with the crowd,
many smiling and chatting. Some handed out hot drinks, bananas and
bowls of soup to the refugees.
   At a table in the train station snack bar sat 21-year-old Mike
Mueller and his wife Monique, 19.
   Mueller, a cook, and his wife, a waitress, said they were fed up
with harsh political conditions at home.
   ``They (Communist authorities) control everything you do,''
Mueller said. ``We applied to go to Hungary on vacation, but they
turned us down. We didn't need permission to go to Prague, so we
went to the embassy and joined the others, hoping to get out.''
   Mrs. Mueller said, ``You can't get ahead over there (in East
Germany). You always have the feeling you are being watched. You
are afraid to discuss anything with your friends.''
   She said the East German news media ``lie and try to tell us the
West just wants to make slaves of us. They really think we're so
stupid we don't know better.''
   East German news media have claimed that West Germany is luring
East Germans as a source of cheap labor.
   Peter Shutz, an auto mechanic, said East German authorities
``try to control everything we do. The young are tired of putting
up with that. It's a dictatorship. All I can say is I'm happy to be
here ... If I work hard over here I know I can get ahead.''
   Shutz was asked why he and other refugees turned down an earlier
East German offer of travel to the West within six months on
condition they first leave the embassy in Prague and return home.
   ``There aren't many people who would fall for something like
that,'' he said.
   Uwe Thuemmel, a 30-year-old East German truck driver, said he
had planned to take advantage of that offer and had traveled to
Prague from Plauen, near the Czechoslovak border.
   ``I left my wife and family at home, thinking I would be back in
three days. But then Genscher's announcement came, so I decided to
leave without my family,'' he said. ``I hope they'll be able to
follow me.''

<HEAD>Defense: Bakker Cross-Examination `Very Devastating'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   PTL founder Jim Bakker didn't do his case
much good when he repeatedly testified that he didn't remember
details of his ministry's finances, his lawyer says.
   ``That was a pretty heavy cross-examination,'' defense attorney
George Davis said of Bakker's appearance on the stand last week.
``It was very damaging, very devastating.''
   The 82-year-old defense lawyer added: ``It didn't have anything
to do with the issues, but ...''
   Bakker, who is charged with 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy,
was scheduled to return to the stand today for more
cross-examination.
   The U.S. District Court jury could get the case by the end of
the week.
   He is accused of diverting most of the $158 million in donations
he raised to build lodging at his religious retreat and theme park,
and using some of the funds to support a lavish life for himself
and his wife, Tammy.
   In last week's testimony, Bakker denied defrauding anyone,
repeatedly saying he had worked hard to keep the PTL dream alive.
Yet he often appeared to be off-guard, particularly as prosecutors
delved into details of PTL's offers to provide free lodging at his
Heritage U.S.A. theme park in exchange for contributions.
   Under three hours of cross-examination, Bakker answered ``I
don't remember'' or its equivalent more than three dozen times.
   In several instances, Bakker said he had told viewers on his
television shows that some changes would be made in the lodging
programs at issue in the case. But he was unable to say when he had
made the announcements, despite having access to the same
videotapes as prosecutors.
   ``There are so many dates,'' Bakker, laughing, said at one point.
   In his initial testimony, Bakker told jurors that when he left
PTL in March 1987, he had built, was building or had plans for
accommodations for more than 211,000 so-called lifetime partners _
the name given followers who gave $1,000 or more in return for
promises of three nights lodging each year for life.
   More than 150,000 lifetime partnerships were sold between
January 1984 and May 1987, including 66,000 in the Heritage Grand
Hotel, where Bakker had said only 25,000 would be sold, and 74,000
in the still-unfinished Towers hotel, where Bakker had said only
30,000 would be sold.
   Bakker attempted to show jurors a chart of the various hotels,
lodges, bunkhouses, chalets and campsites he said could have
accommodated the 211,000 partners. But prosecutors objected that
the chart contained information that was not in evidence and was
misleading.
   Later, Bakker flatly accused former employees of either lying or
making errors in saying he had ordered diversions of money and the
destruction of corporate records.
   Even documented evidence met resistance from Bakker.
   When prosecutors tried to use PTL records to show Bakker had
reopened partnerships after they had been overbooked, Bakker said
he did not recall doing that. He also denied signing several
letters and memos, except for two on which the FBI had found his
palm print.
   Shown a 1986 memo ordering bonuses to two PTL employees, Bakker
said, ``That's what it said,'' but added, ``I did not do this.''

<HEAD>Casey and Jean Kasem Play Host for Homeless Benefit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Casey Kasem and his actress-wife, Jean,
transformed their luxurious home into a huge lawn circus to raise
money for the homeless.
   Celebrities including Stevie Wonder, Paula Abdul, Lou Ferrigno,
Ally Sheedy, Cesar Romero, Valerie Harper, and Victoria Principal
were among the more than 2,000 guests, said Karen Kukurin, a
spokeswoman for the couple.
   Jugglers, mimes, sword swallowers, clowns, and fire eaters
performed along the 3-acre estate's nine-hole golf course,
transformed into a midway for Sunday's event, she said.
   The fund-raiser also featured an auction of $3.5 million worth
of sculpture and oil paintings.
   It was not immediately known how much the auction had raised for
an Oct. 7 march on Washington, D.C., to draw attention to the
problem on homelessness, said Kukurin.
   The Kasems are among about 200 celebrities planning to attend
the march.
   ``The affordable housing crisis and its most visible symptom _
homelessness _ are a national disgrace,'' said Jean Kasem, whose
acting credits include the television series ``Cheers'' and ``The
Tortellis.''
   Casey Kasem's syndicated radio show is heard 450 stations each
week.

   Communist China marked its 40th anniversary with
fireworks displays and dances on Tiananmen Square, which thousands
of police patrolled to ensure the celebrations would not be
disrupted.
   Thousands of police mingled with the 130,000 performers, and
residential areas around the square were cordoned off hours before
Sunday's show. Only people with passes were allowed to enter.
   A million people joined anniversary events around a tightly
guarded Beijing on Sunday. Along city streets, potted flowers were
arranged in designs that praised socialism and the Communist Party.
   The highlight was the nationally televised 3{-hour dance and
fireworks display on Tiananmen Square.
   The symbolic seat of power in China, the square has been under
military guard since troops on June 3-4 put down the pro-democracy
movement, killing hundreds of unarmed civilians.
   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping, 85, watched the performance from
the Tiananmen Gate rostrum above a huge portrait of Mao Tse-tung.
From the same spot, Mao declared the founding of the People's
Republic on Oct. 1, 1949.
   Communist Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng
and 84-year-old Chen Yun, an ideological hard-liner who rarely
appears in public, joined Deng.
   Western ambassadors boycotted the show to demonstrate continued
concern over China's suppression of dissent and most foreign guests
were from socialist countries such as the Soviet Union, North
Korea, East Germany and Czechoslovakia.
   The most prominent American to sit with the leaders was former
Secretary of State Alexander Haig, now a private businessmen. He is
in Beijing for a business symposium.
   The official Xinhua News Agency quoted Deng as telling North
Korean Politburo member Li Jong Ok that the spring political
turmoil ``was bad, but in the final analysis it is beneficial to
us, because it made us more sober-minded.''
   Deng, said that because of the spread of Western ideas before
the military crackdown, ``for a period of time some of our
ideological front was lost.''
   But he said now ``social order has returned to normal.''
   Despite frequent assertions that all is normal in Beijing, the
city remains under martial law and security was extremely tight
around Tiananmen. Police and troops, some armed with rifles,
patrolled city streets.
   Those who danced on the square and other places were carefully
selected for their political reliability and non-participation in
the spring demonstrations.
   Some offices and factories provided cash bonuses for employees
who volunteered to dance on the anniversary.
   The government led up to the national day with television and
radio and press reports about China's achievements over the past
four decades in developing industry and agriculture, and caring for
its 1.1 billion people.
   There has been little mention of the political and economic
upheavals under Communist rule. Reports have been couched within
the central theme that only socialism can save China and only the
Communist Party is qualified to rule the nation.
   ``There is no doubt that the socialist system is superior to the
capitalist system,'' the Communist Party's official People's Daily
said in an editorial.

<HEAD>Composer, Critic Virgil Thomson Dead at 92</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL GEITNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Virgil Thomson, the Pulitzer Prize-winning
composer and music critic whose career spanned more than half a
century, has died at age 92.
   Thomson, who had been in failing health for a long time, died in
his sleep early Saturday in his room at Manhattan's Chelsea Hotel
where he had lived almost 50 years, said his secretary, Jay
Sullivan.
   Thomson won the Pulitzer Prize for music for his score to the
documentary film ``Louisiana Story,'' in 1949 _ the only time the
Pulitzer has been awarded for a movie score.
   ``The death of Virgil T is like the death of an American city:
it is intolerable,'' said composer-conductor Leonard Bernstein.
``Virgil was loving and harsh, generous and mordant, simple but
cynical, son of the hymnal yet highly sophisticated. ...
   ``But he will always remain brightly alive in the history of
music, if only for the extraordinary influence his witty and
simplistic music had on his colleagues.''
   Thomson's long career included orchestral and choral works as
well as incidental music for plays by authors from Shakespeare to
Truman Capote.
   In 1988, Thomson was one of 12 recipients of the National Medal
of Arts, an award created by Congress four years earlier at the
suggestion of President Reagan.
   Born in Kansas City, Mo., Thomson began to play piano at age 5
and, as a teen-ager, worked as a church organist.
   In 1922, he graduated from Harvard University and moved to
Paris, where he was among a group of young American musicians such
as Aaron Copland to study with Nadia Boulanger. In Paris, he also
met the iconoclastic composer Erik Satie, who was a great influence
on him.
   While in Paris, he met Gertrude Stein and wrote one of his most
famous works, the opera ``Four Saints in Three Acts,'' with her as
librettist in 1928. It premiered in Hartford, Conn., in 1934 and
had a short but successful run on Broadway.
   He settled in New York in 1940 and joined the staff of the New
York Herald Tribune, where he was music critic until 1954.
   In 1982, he won a National Book Critics Circle Award for ``A
Virgil Thomson Reader.''
   Thomson's latest book, ``Music with Words,'' is to be released
officially Oct. 18 by Yale University Press. Sullivan described it
as a ``how-to book for composers, people who are interested in
setting words to music or music to words.''
   In an interview with The Associated Press before his 90th
birthday, the cherubic, white-haired Thomson said, ``I've got
nothing wrong with me except I'm deaf and overweight. You don't die
from those.''
   Thomson said the hearing problem kept him from enjoying musical
performances more than 10 years ago, but he continued to compose
and kept busy on the lecture circuit.
   He recalled that his first Tribune music review said violinist
Jascha Heifetz played ``silk underwear music,'' but joked that when
some other critic is unkind about his own music, ``I'm convinced
the writer is an ignorant pipsqueak and probably in the pay of my
enemies.''
   Thomson, who never married, is survived by a niece, Betty
Stouffer, of Longwood, Fla. He will be buried in a family plot in
Slater, Mo., Sullivan said.
   A memorial service is planned at the Cathedral of St. John the
Divine in New York on Nov. 25 _ what would have been Thomson's 93rd
birthday.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index fell back from
its record high morning close today, and the dollar declined
against the Japanese yen for the sixth consecutive trading day.
   The dollar closed at 139.30 yen, down 0.05 yen from last
Friday's 139.35-yen finish. It opened at 138.77 yen and moved
between 138.65 yen and 139.48 yen. The dollar now has fallen 5.70
yen in six days.
   Market players, reassured by the governing Liberal Democratic
Party's parliamentary by-election victory on Sunday, tended to buy
the yen in early trading, said Minori Takeuchi, a trader with
Chemical Bank.
   ``But the dollar rose afterward in mixed trading, mainly for
technical position adjustments,'' she said.
   She added that market players were reluctant to buy the dollar
at the 139.50-yen level for fear of Bank of Japan intervention.
   The central bank has been selling dollars over the last week to
check the U.S. currency's recent rise. The amount of selling was
unknown, and the bank does not comment on its exchange market
activities.
   On the stock exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost
13.79 points, or 0.04 percent, ending at 35,622.97. In early
trading, it had climbed to 35,701.33, its highest ever morning
closing. The index had shed 53.22 points on Friday.
   The Liberal Democrats' by-election victory also prompted the
index's early gain, said Masahiro Umemori, a stock analyst with
Nomura Securities.
   ``But the index started falling later mainly because
participants became afraid of recent rapid rises in share prices,''
he said, noting the index's 500-point gain last week.
   ``Afternoon trading was directionless, too,'' he said.
   A rumor that West Germany might raise its interest rates soon
also discouraged investors, Umemori said.
   ``The rumor even said there might be a coordinated interest rate
hike in a few countries,'' he added, without elaboration.
   Trading was moderate, with first section volume estimated at 750
million shares, down from 900 million last Friday.
   Electrical issues such as Sony and Pioneer and steel issues were
losers.

<HEAD>Florida Becomes Fifth State to Ban Dropouts From Driving</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CURT ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Florida has joined the growing list of
states that withhold driver's licenses from high-school dropouts,
but teachers aren't sure the change will improve education or just
keep bad students in school.
   The law, which took effect Sunday, drew praise from some
educators as an attention-grabbing way to cut the dropout rate.
   ``I believe this is an excellent tool for parents to use to
encourage their students to remain in school,'' said Betty Castor,
Florida commissioner of education.
   But others say the law could create a bureaucratic nightmare and
just might cause discipline problems by keeping reluctant students
in the classroom.
   ``There may be more children who will be in school. But they
don't want to be in there and they may become problems in the
classroom,'' said Mary Kay Cariseo of the state Association of
School Administrators. ``Sometimes these children just don't care.''
   West Virginia broke ground last year with a law requiring
teen-agers to stay in school to keep their driving privileges.
Arkansas, Texas and Louisiana followed suit, and dozens of similar
bills are pending in legislatures around the country.
   Rep. George Sangmeister, D-Ill., has introduced legislation to
make such a ban nationwide.
   The Florida law says students must stay in school or an eligible
program _ such as a course for a high school equivalency test or a
training program _ or the license will be suspended until age 18.
   The state Department of Education estimates 9,200 students will
decide to stay in school in order to keep driving. Because the law
also limits unexcused absences _ 11 in a row or 20 for the year _
supporters of the law say attendance might improve for perhaps
62,000 students.
   Nearly 30,000 drop out every year in Florida.
   The report card on similar laws in other states is mixed.
   ``It's so new that I don't think anybody really knows all the
effects,'' said Mary Ellen Parker of the National Association of
Secondary School Principals. ``A lot of people simply think it's
too broad.''
   Through February, 1,809 dropouts returned to school in West
Virginia, but 48 percent of them then left school a second time,
said Therese Wilson, acting director of state educational support
services. More than 780 teen-agers' licenses have been revoked
under the law, she said.
   In Florida, schools across the state must certify in writing
that each student meets the attendance rules when they apply for
driver's licenses. Teen-agers become eligible to drive at age 16.
   Many Florida school administrators anticipate the law will bring
a deluge of paperwork that could clog up the system, Ms. Cariseo
said.
   ``Every child has got to get these forms,'' Ms. Cariseo said.
``I think the main problem is going to be keeping up with that and
notifying the Highway Safety Department once they drop out.''
   Castor, the education commissioner, plans to ask the Legislature
for $5.8 million to cover administrative costs, with the funds to
come from Florida's lottery.
   Backers say the law will back up parents' warnings about the
danger of dropping out.
   ``It's hard to tell a student he'll have a lower-paying job when
he's 30 and have him listen,'' said education department spokesman
David Voss. ``When a parent says `You can't drive any more,' it's
immediate.''

<HEAD>Marcos Death Sets off Scramble for Mantle of Leadership</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By EILEEN GUERRERO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition politicians are backing
efforts by Ferdinand Marcos' followers to bring his body home as
part of an apparent scramble to receive the mantel of leadership of
the late's president's following.
   Marcos died Thursday in Hawaii, where he had lived since his
ouster in the popular uprising three years ago that propelled
Corazon Aquino into the presidency.
   Mrs. Aquino has banned the return of the former leader's body,
citing national security. Marcos supporters today asked the Supreme
Court to overturn the ban.
   Political analysts expect that with Marcos' death, his New
Society Movement party will break up because it lacks leaders of
national prominence.
   The fact that Marcos designated no clear-cut successor will
intensify efforts by major politicians to win the support of his
constituency.
   Sen. Ernesto Herrera, an Aquino supporter, predicted a ``massive
regrouping of various forces, galvanized by the clamor to lift the
Marcos ban.''
   ``The Marcos followers and sympathizers, having lost a prime
mover, are now in search of a new leader who could unify and rally
them into a strong, cohesive party,'' he said.
   Although Marcos' popular support had dwindled, he still enjoyed
a large following among his 6 million fellow Ilocanos, a linguistic
group in northern Luzon.
   The New Society Movement is also believed to be well-financed
and have a network of experienced political operatives nationwide.
   In congressional and regional elections since Mrs. Aquino took
office in February 1986, the Marcos party has fared poorly, except
in northern Luzon and scattered parts of Mindanao and the Visayas
islands.
   But Mrs. Aquino's decision to ban Marcos' body is controversial,
even among her supporters. Six pro-Aquino lawmakers in the
23-member Senate support his return. Opposition to the ban is also
widespread in the 200-member House of Representatives.
   Pro-Marcos politicians see the issue as a means of winning
broad-based sympathy in a culture which respects the right of the
dead to be buried in their homeland.
   This explains the absence of massive public demonstrations in
the wake of Marcos' death. His supporters say they have decided for
now to avoid large protests for fear violence would tarnish their
image as an aggrieved party and ruin chances for the body's return.
   Politicians not identified as pro-Marcos see the issue as a
means of currying support among his followers without being tainted
with loyalist label.
   Chief among those angling for support in Marcos' camp include
Vice President Salvador Laurel and Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, both of
whom are widely assumed to have ambitions of succeeding Mrs. Aquino
in the 1992 elections.
   Mrs. Aquino says she will not run again.
   Laurel and Enrile, president and vice president of the
opposition Nacionalista party, quickly endorsed the return of
Marcos' body. On Saturday, Laurel called a press conference to
announce the planned Supreme Court appeal even before it was
confirmed by the petitioners.
   Previous attempts by Laurel and Enrile to forge an alliance with
Marcos' followers broke down because of the reluctance of the late
president's supporters to break with their leader as long as he was
alive.
   Laurel, once a leading anti-Marcos figure, began cultivating
contacts with the Marcos family soon after the former president was
hospitalized in January.
   Enrile served as Marcos' defense minister and held the post
under the Aquino administration until he was fired in November 1986
after a failed coup by his followers.
   Despite Enrile's role in the 1986 ouster of Marcos, he remains
an attractive figure for many loyalists because he is an Ilocano
like their late leader.
   One major factor in the realignment will be the role of Marcos'
flamboyant and influential widow, Imelda. Political analysts
believe the ambitious Imelda is exploiting Mrs. Aquino's ban to
promote her image as an underdog, a sympathetic figure in
Philippine culture.
   ``If President Aquino insists on her ban from President Marcos
being brought here, the anger of the people might turn into pity
for the (former) first lady and rally behind her,'' said Jesus
Nalupta, mayor of the Marcos ancestral hometown, Batac.
   It is also unclear what role Marcos' only son, Ferdinand Jr.,
will play. Analysts say the 32-year-old Marcos is too young to
become the leader immediately but will wield considerable influence
in determining the New Society Movement's future.
   ``This is the end of an era,'' the younger Marcos said Sunday in
Honolulu. ``And I find myself facing the awesome responsibility of
trying to fill my father's shoes.''

   A teen-age father who's fighting a law
that bars high-school dropouts from driving says such laws are
probably a good idea _ there just has to be room for exceptions.
   Michael Means, 17, finds it tough to make ends meet since losing
his license, but he doesn't blame his lack of formal education.
Rather, he says he had to quit his job pumping gasoline to because
of the publicity over his court fight against the law that bars
high school dropouts from driving.
   The experience left him bitter about the law.
   ``I think that the people, the judges and the governor, think
they own everybody in the state, especially the younger people who
it doesn't matter what they say or do,'' Means said last week.
``Children should be seen but not heard _ I don't think it's fair.''
   Means' trouble began last fall when the Department of Motor
Vehicles cited the new law in refusing to replace his lost license.
The county school system later identified Means as a dropout,
setting up a court test for the nation's first law barring dropouts
from driving until they reach age 18.
   Despite his argument that he needed to drive to provide for his
then-pregnant wife, a Kanawha County judge last month refused to
give him back his license. An appeal is planned as early as this
week.
   Means, who left school at age 16, called Judge Paul Zakaib's
decision ``pretty stupid'' in his case but said the law is worth
pursuing by other states.
   ``It's a good law. It's good if kids go back to school,'' he
said. ``But there should be exceptions. There has to be exceptions
to everything.''
   State education officials point to positive re-enrollment
numbers and say they have been flooded with calls from virtually
every state in the country seeking information on the law.
   Rep. George Sangmeister, D-Ill., has introduced legislation that
would impose the dropout driver ban nationwide. Arkansas, Florida,
Louisiana and Texas have passed similar legislation.
   Through February, 1,809 dropouts returned to school in West
Virginia, and 48 percent of them then left school a second time,
said Therese Wilson, acting director of state educational support
services. More than 780 teen-agers' licenses have been revoked
under the law, she said.
   Without a license, Means and his wife of a year were forced to
move in with his parents, whose four-bedroom home already had two
adults and three children.
   His 17-year-old wife, Tonya, also a dropout, said the situation
puts a strain on the family.
   ``There's a time or two when his mom or dad or my mom will take
us down and buy things for the baby that we don't have money to
get,'' she said. ``Parents can only stretch so far, especially when
they get a family as big as theirs.''
   Mean's father, William, supported his son's decision to quit
school. ``If you can read and write and do arithmetic, that's the
basics. That's all you really need to get by on.''
   But the younger Means said he plans to make sure his son doesn't
drop out. ``I don't think I would like it,'' Means said. ``I'm
going to keep him in school as much as possible.''
   Means' immediate goal is to get a house and a job other than
cutting lawns. He talks of starting a stoneworking business with
his father.
   While the loss of his license made it tough for Means to get to
his service station job, he said he had to quit the job because
reporters covering the ground-breaking case made it impossible to
work.
   ``They kept coming up to where I work with cameras and I had to
work,'' Means said. ``I had to be on TV and I had to work. It was
putting a strain on everybody.''

packing winds up to 45 mph.
   Colleen was expected to intensify to typhoon status, with 75 mph
winds, when it sweeps within 70 miles south of Guam on Tuesday, the
Joint Typhoon Warning Center said.
   At 1 p.m. today (10 p.m. Sunday EDT), Colleen was at 11.5

east-southeast of Andersen Air Force Base on Guam, the center said.
   As of 3 p.m., maximum winds were 40 to 45 mph and the storm was
moving to the west-northwest at 12 to 14 mph.
   Guam's Civil Defense issued a tropical-storm alert and said
Colleen could hit the island within 72 hours.
   Military officials were meeting to determine when airplanes and

<TEXT>
   Former members of the Tiananmen Square
democracy movement are urging Americans and ``peace-loving people
all over the world'' to continue pressing for freedom in China.
   Three former members of the pro-democracy movement led about
3,500 demonstrators Sunday to protest the 40th anniversary of
communist rule in their homeland.
   The marchers walked in a downpour from the Lincoln Memorial to
the Chinese Embassy here to protest the violent crackdown on the
student democracy movement in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. Nearly
2,000 other marchers demonstrated in Los Angeles and San Francisco,
and hundreds marched in Canada.
   ``The Chinese government must stop killing,'' said Shen Tong,
one of the three pro-democracy leaders, who fled China after the
crackdown last summer. ``We appeal to peace-loving people all over
the world to stand together with us and fight for a China in which
basic freedoms are guaranteed.''
   Another of the three emigres, Wu'er Kaxi, told a small news
conference outside the Chinese Embassy that ``the attitude of the
American people as well as that of Congress has been clear since
the events'' of the crackdown. Asked whether he had any specific
criticisms or demands of the Bush administration, he replied, ``No
comment.''
   Shen, Wu'er and the third leader, LiuYan, were in Washington for
a fast and protest. Police estimated the crowd of marchers at 3,500.
   In San Francisco, 1,200 people shouted and waved signs outside
the Chinese consulate in a noisy but peaceful protest against
National Day, the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the
People's Republic of China.
   Protesters during the three-hour demonstration said four decades
of communism had been a failure for China and blasted the Chinese
government's repression of the pro-democracy movement.
   Many of the signs pledged to remember the ``martyrs'' of
democracy, hundreds of students who were killed when troops fired
on Beijing's Tiananmen Square last June.
   Police reported no arrests or problems because of the protests.
   In Los Angeles, some 700 people gathered peacefully outside the
Chinese consulate downtown waving human rights signs, singing peace
songs and cheering speeches by university students, Christian
clergyman and community leaders.
   The crowd, mainly Chinese natives, formed a semicircle on the
street in front of a military tank, two tents, a 5-foot Goddess of
Liberty statue and a gray coffin, on which dozens of spectators
placed white flowers.
   The Joint Committee of Chinese Students and Scholars sponsored
the two-hour protest which included a re-enactment of the student
massacre and a mock trial.
   Ting Huang, a computer engineer and native Chinese, donned a
T-shirt with a picture of Deng Xiaoping, the 85-year-old senior
leader in China. The words above the photo stated ``Wanted for
Murder.''
   ``I'm here to protest continuing human rights violations in
China, secret arrests and imprisonment,'' Huang said.
   On Oct. 1, 1949, Mao Zedong declared the founding of the
People's Republic of China.
   About 500 people demonstrated in front of the Chinese embassy in
Ottawa, while 300 rallied in Toronto.
   ``We are going to use every occasion to help people remember
June 4 and tell the world we will never forget, nor will we stop
fighting for democracy,'' said Dennis Lu, president of the Canadian
Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars in Toronto.
   Several protesters wore brown paper bags on their heads, fearing
for the safety of relatives still in China.

   Anti-nuclear protesters have ended a
five-day protest at a U.S.-Australian military intelligence base
after 500 demonstrators were arrested, some after breaking into the
base.
   About 50 soldiers were called in to reinforce base security
forces and police at the base in southern Australia. In the action
that ended Sunday, protesters broke into the facility several
times, police said.
   Today, Defense Minister Kim Beazley ordered an investigation
into security measures at the base.
   Demonstrators picked the intelligence-gathering base 360 miles
northwest of Adelaide as a protest site because they consider it a
likely target in the event of a superpower nuclear confrontation.
   Police said 217 of the 500 protesters were arrested inside the
Nurrungar base's security zone.
   The media were prohibited from covering a march from the
security gate to the main complex by protesters who broke into the
grounds. Six journalists were arrested during protests on Saturday.
   A Sydney newspaper said the protest was ``an embarrassment for
Australia's defense forces and must give American military
authorities cause for concern.''
   ``If we are to have U.S. bases and equipment here we should be
able to protect them,'' said today's editorial in The Sydney Daily
Telegraph.

<HEAD>Researchers Say Underground AIDS Drug Ineffective Against Virus</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By A.J. HOSTETLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A report that a popular underground drug is
ineffective against the AIDS virus proves that the government
should move cautiously before allowing people to take such
medicine, some researchers said.
   In the Oct. 1 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine, the
researchers reported on the use of dextran sulfate in 18 healthy
volunteers. After administering the drug orally and intravenously,
the researchers found only traces of the drug's activity using
three different methods.
   ``This is a drug people are going to have to take two steps
backward and take another look at,'' said Dr. Robert Yarchoan, an
AIDS researcher at the National Cancer Institute. ``Just because it
works in a laboratory, you can't just go stuffing it in your
mouth.''
   He said the report should remind researchers and policymakers
alike to look at ``the simple things,'' such as whether a drug can
be absorbed into the bloodstream, before allowing patients to take
it.
   The study confirms preliminary results announced in February by
Dr. Frank E. Young, commissioner of the Food and Drug
Administration, that the drug is poorly absorbed into the
bloodstream and shows little promise of fighting the AIDS virus.
   Researchers in 1987 discovered that dextran sulfate prevented
the human immunodeficiency virus, HIV, from invading the T-cell
lymphocytes, a type of immunity cell that the AIDS virus normally
attacks.
   Following those reports, AIDS patients clamored for the FDA to
allow them to import the drug from Japan, where it was used as an
anti-clotting agent. Dextran sulfate's use has not been approved by
the FDA.
   The drug has been imported from Mexico and Japan during the past
two years by ``buyers' clubs'' organized by people infected with
the virus. Last May, the FDA approved the drug for use in limited
clinical trials.
   Tests of the drug in volunteers, however, have since
contradicted the early laboratory findings.
   Since the publicity generated by the reports of dextran
sulfate's success in the laboratory, some researchers felt public
pressure made the drug available too early without sufficient
testing, according to the principal investigator, Dr. Paul S.
Lietman of The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.
   Lietman said he thought the study's results showed that the FDA
should continue to move cautiously in allowing AIDS patients access
to untested drugs.
   ``The easier access to unproven drugs is a step backwards,'' he
said.
   Researchers had hoped dextran sulfate might prove effective
because it appeared to prevent the AIDS virus from attacking a
vital player in the body's immune system, the T-cell.
   Usually, the virus attacks the T-cells by attaching to a
receptor, a type of protein, on the cell's outer layer or envelope.
In the test tube studies, researchers found that dextran sulfate
prevented the virus from binding to the cell envelope, thus
preventing it from invading and killing the cell.
   Untreated, HIV changes the genetic pattern of the T-cell and
forces it to make copies of the virus. But this cannot happen if
the virus cannot invade the cell.
   But the researchers at Hopkins, the FDA and the University of
Colorado Health Sciences Center found little evidence that the drug
was absorbed into the bloodstream.
   ``If dextran sulfate is ultimately found to be an effective
anti-HIV agent in humans, its therapeutic index is likely to be
small,'' warned the researchers.
   In addition, the drug is unlikely to prove useful when given
intravenously, as the size of the large molecule prohibits it from
easily crossing membranes, according to Lietman.
   Dr. Donald Abrams of San Francisco General Hospital, who has
investigated dextran sulfate since 1986, said the drug had little
effect in patients infected with the AIDS virus.
   ``I don't think anybody believes anymore that dextran sulfate
has any utility,'' Abrams said.

<HEAD>Actor George Hamilton Reportedly Named as Marcos Co-Conspirator</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor George Hamilton has been described by
federal authorities as an unindicted co-conspirator of former
Philippines first lady Imelda Marcos, a newspaper reported today.
   Hamilton's name appeared on documents filed in U.S. District
Court in connection with the case against Mrs. Marcos, according to
New York Newsday.
   ``I can't give you any information,'' said Hamilton's agent, Tom
Corman.
   An indictment last October charged that Mrs. Marcos and her
husband, the late Philippines President Ferdinand E. Marcos, stole
$168 million from the Philippine treasury.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles G. LaBella would not say why
Hamilton was on the list of unindicted co-conspirators, according
to Newsday.
   Also named were Manhattan real estate developers, Joseph and
Ralph Bernstein, who are brothers, and the Marcos' children, Irene,
Imee and Ferdinand Jr., the newspaper said.
   The Bernstein brothers have told a congressional hearing that
they managed the Marcoses' New York real estate investments.
   An unindicted co-conspirator may have done something to advance
an alleged criminal conspiracy, but did not necessarily know they
were doing it.
   The list of unindicted co-conspirators was included in a
pretrial motion filed by one of Mrs. Marcos' co-defendants,
California Overseas Bank.
   The actor, known for his perpetual tan and for his portrayal of
a vampire in the movie ``Love at First Bite,'' has denied rumors
that he and Mrs. Marcos were romantically linked.
   Hamilton's name previously has come up in connection with legal
action against the Marcoses, specifically, in a lawsuit by the
Philippines government against the Marcoses.
   Alan D. Bersin, an attorney for the Philippines, said the suit
alleges that the Marcoses invested in a Beverly Hills house owned
by Hamilton.
   Hamilton has said he has done nothing wrong.
   In March 1986, Hamilton said through his attorney, Michael
Sherman, that Marcos had no financial involvement in the estate.
   Hamilton bought the estate, once owned by Charlie Chaplin, for
$1.2 million in 1981. The deal was financed by Hamilton's own
money, Wells Fargo Bank and the seller, Sherman said.
   In late 1983, Hamilton used the increased value of the property
to get a five-year loan from Calno Holdings N.V. in the Netherlands
Antilles. Calno reportedly has ties with the Marcos family.

<TEXT>
   Huynh Tan Phat, a leading member of the
Viet Cong and later vice president of Vietnam's State Council, has
died at age 76, the Vietnam News Agency reported.
   The report, seen in Bangkok today, said Phat died Saturday in Ho
Chi Minh City. Radio Hanoi said he would be buried Thursday in the
southern city, formerly called Saigon.
   A graduate in architecture from Hanoi University, Phat joined
the anti-French underground and was imprisoned by the colonial
government. Some reference books say Phat initially may have held
anti-communist views.
   He rose in the ranks of the Democratic Party in South Vietnam
but repression of that party by President Ngo Diem forced Phat into
the resistance in the late 1950s.
   Phat emerged as the chief theoretician of the National
Liberation Front, the key southern Communist-led movement whose
members were often called Viet Cong.
   After the Communist victory in Vietnam in 1975, Phat was one of
the few members of the Viet Cong to hold a leadership position in a
Hanoi government and Communist Party dominated by northern
Vietnamese.
   He served as vice chairman of the Council of State and chairman
of the Presidium of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, one of a number
of mass organizations under party and government control.

<TEXT>
   Some of the record 20 tons of cocaine seized
last week apparently was stored earlier in warehouses in El Paso,
Texas, and across that city's border with Mexico, drug enforcement
officials said.
   Seven men arrested in the case _ four in Los Angeles and three
in Las Vegas _ were expected to be arraigned before federal
magistrates today.
   On Friday, the day after investigators stumbled upon the Los
Angeles warehouse, officials raided six warehouses in El Paso and
three homes in Juarez, across the Rio Grande.
   ``We feel these warehouses were used as staging warehouses
before the cocaine was sent to Los Angeles,'' said U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration special agent Phil Jordan.
   Police said the four suspects held in suburban Los Angeles so
far had thwarted investigators' attempts to identify them, giving
false names and birthdates and saying only that they were from
Mexico. Mexican police were said to have the identity of at least
one of the men.
   ``We really don't know who they are ourselves,'' said police
Sgt. Mike Leinen of Huntington Park, where the cocaine was found.
``They're not too forthcoming.''
   Authorities believe the men are Mexican or Colombian, Jordan
said.
   Investigators believe one of those arrested in Las Vegas, Carlos
Tapia Ponce, may have directed the ring's operations, authorities
said. DEA spokesman Ralph Lochridge said Tapia Ponce worked as a
customs inspector for the Mexican government in Juarez for 15 years.
   ``He is the person who rented the warehouse. He paid the
bills,'' said Curt Hazell, a deputy Los Angeles County district
attorney.
   Tapia Ponce, 68, was arrested at the Flamingo Hilton hotel in
Las Vegas, with his son, Eduardo Tapia Ponce, 34, and his brother,
Hector Tapia, 66.
   Investigators said the cocaine entered the United States through
El Paso before it was shipped to the warehouse operating as
Adriana's Pottery Warehouse, where the the record seizure was made
Thursday.
   One link between the suburban Los Angeles seizure and a house in
Juarez was confirmed when one of the suspects arrested in
California telephoned the house from jail. A police officer there
answered the phone, Jordan said.
   He said Mexican Federal Judicial Police know the identity of the
caller.
   No arrests were made at the house, but a tractor and two
trailers fitted with secret compartments were seized. ``In one of
these compartments we found 500 pounds of marijuana,'' Jordan said.
   DEA agents in El Paso also found boxes similar to those found in
the California raid, along with Mexican pottery.
   The cocaine seizure attracted so much attention that crowds
showed up at the unguarded California warehouse and began removing
its remaining contents only hours after the cocaine was removed.
   About 50 looters snatched up Mexican pottery, paintings,
statues, desks, chairs, telephones and other office supplies.
   No looting arrests were made, and no evidence was taken, police
said.

   An FBI agent shot and killed an off-duty

rifle while struggling with another agent, authorities said.
   The firefighter and three FBI agents were among a group
preparing to go scuba diving, police said.
   Steven Lopez, 38, of Staten Island, was pronounced dead at the
scene of Sunday's shooting, said Officer Hugh Barry, a police
spokesman.
   Agent Richard Tait, who fired the fatal shot, remained on duty,
and the bureau began an investigation, as is routine in such cases,
said FBI spokesman Joseph Valiquette.
   Tait was to receive scuba training on the dive, Valiquette said.
   As the men prepared to dive, Lopez got into a struggle with
Agent John R. Dew, Valiquette said. Lopez was holding the rifle
during the struggle and it discharged once without hurting anyone,
the spokesman said.
   Tait drew his service revolver and ordered Lopez to drop his
gun, then shot him in the chest, Valiquette said. The spokesman
didn't offer a motive for the confrontation.
   Asked if the shooting was deemed justified, Valiquette said,
``There is nothing that would indicate anything to the contrary at
this point.''

<HEAD>Former Stanford Physics Professor William Fairbank Dead at 72</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STANFORD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William Fairbank, whose work in
low-temperature superconductivity laid the foundation for hundreds
of scientific experiments around the world, has died. He was 72.
   Fairbank, professor emeritus of physics at Stanford University,
suffered a heart attack Saturday while jogging near campus,
university officials said Sunday.
   Fairbank researched the nature of superconductivity and
participated in the search for gravity waves, subatomic particles
called quarks, and monopoles, believed to be a component of
magnetism.
   His work is the basis of a multi-million dollar project to test
a final unproven prediction of Albert Einstein's general theory of
relativity.
   Fairbank, who was working in his lab the night before his death,
believed in what he called the ``Anti-Murphy Law of Physics.'' His
theory held that when one understands an experimental situation
correctly, three or four things come together to make the
impossible possible.
   He performed his first superconductivity experiment in 1947 with
his brother, Henry, also a physicist.
   Fairbank's work centered on the ability of some materials to
offer no resistance to an electrical current if they are cooled to
near absolute zero. Stanford said Fairbank's influence on physics
included the development at Stanford of the superconducting
accelerator in which a linear accelerator is cooled to 2 degrees
above absolute zero. The superconductivity allows for greater
degrees of sensitivity and led to the first demonstration of a free
electron laser.
   Fairbank was born in Minneapolis on Feb. 24, 1917. He graduated
from Whitman College in Washington and earned his Ph.D. from Yale
University in 1948.
   Before joining Stanford in 1959, he taught at the University of
Washington, Amherst College and Duke University, as well as working
on the staff of the Radiation Laboratory at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
   Fairbank is survived by his wife, Jane, and sons, William Jr.,
Robert, and Richard. His brother is professor emeritus of physics
at Duke University.
   Funeral arrangements were not immediately announced.

   A retired pressman's murderous schemes
were common knowledge at the plant where he returned last month and
shot to death eight people before killing himself, according to a
report.
   Joseph Wesbecker revealed his plans on several occasions to
former co-worker James R. Lucas, but the warnings were ignored by
other co-workers and supervisors and they were never taken up with
management, The Courier-Journal reported Sunday.
   Wesbecker, 47, shot 20 of his former co-workers, killing eight
of them before taking his own life Sept. 14.
   Lucas said the first warning came in late 1987 or early 1988,
inside the Standard Gravure Corp. plant, where Wesbecker opened a
brown paper sack and showed Lucas a .38-caliber snub-nosed revolver.
   Lucas recalls that Wesbecker said he was angry at supervisors:
``That if any one of them came up to him and said anything other
than what pertained to work-related conversation, that he was going
to blow their brains out.''
   Another warning came just a few weeks ago, Lucas said, when
Wesbecker confided the names of six people he intended to kill
during a conversation at the kitchen table at Lucas' house.
   All had been pressroom supervisors or were managers of the
plant. Only one, employee relations manager Paula Warman, was
injured in the attack.
   Wesbecker, who was placed on long-term disability early in the
year because of psychiatric problems, also described putting
plastic explosives into a remote-controlled airplane, Lucas said.
   Lucas said he believed his tormented friend was serious, and
began warning others.
   But for a variety of reasons _ the airplane scheme's
improbability, the frequency of bitterness among Standard Gravure
workers, and others' affection for Wesbecker _ Lucas said his fears
weren't shared by others.
   The schemes became common knowledge among pressroom workers and
supervisors, but upper management was never informed of it, the
Courier-Journal reported.
   Donald Cox, pressroom superintendent and one of Lucas' targets,
said he didn't take Lucas' warnings seriously because he doubted
Wesbecker was skilled enough to pull off the airplane scheme. He
also said he believed Wesbecker was satisfied with the arrangements
of his disability leave.
   Lucas, however, said he knew better.
   ``I knew something was going to happen, but I didn't know when
or what time or where it was coming from,'' he said. ``Every day I
hid in different dark spots of the plant. I didn't go in the
pressroom or stay around the presses,'' he said.
   ``I think what he was doing, he was reaching out to me and I
didn't grasp it,'' he said. ``God forgive me, I didn't grasp it.''

   The publisher of the new St. Louis Sun would
consider starting newspapers in 10 other cities if the Sun
succeeds, according to a published report.
   There is no timetable for the projects being considered by
Ingersoll Publications Co., Robert Jelenic, vice president of
Ingersoll and president of the Sun, told Crain's Cleveland Business.
   ``It could be one year or it could be five years,'' Jelenic
said. ``Right now, we're not going around looking at other places.
We're focused on the St. Louis Sun.''
   Ingersoll, based in Princeton, N.J., started the Sun last week,
bucking an industry trend toward closing and consolidation of
big-city papers.
   Other cities the company would consider entering if the Sun
succeeds, Jelenic said, are Cleveland; Columbus, Ohio; Atlanta,
Buffalo, N.Y.; Las Vegas; Los Angeles, Miami, San Diego, Washington
and Orlando, Fla.
   Ingersoll Publications, owned and managed by Ralph Ingersoll II,
owns 40 daily news papers and 150 weeklies.

<HEAD>Arafat Urges Tokyo To Cut Trade with Israel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PLO chairman Yasser Arafat, in Japan for the first
time as a guest of the government, said today that this oil-poor
nation must be sensitive to Arab concerns and cut its trade with
Israel, a news report said.
   ``It is not necessary for you to think of our interests, think
of your own interests,'' Japan's Kyodo News Service quoted Arafat
as saying.
   Japan would be making a ``fatal mistake'' by ignoring the
Palestinians, who have the support of 200 million Arabs in a vital
region, it quoted Arafat as saying in a speech at the Foreign
Ministry.
   Japan's trade with Israel last year was roughly $1.2 billion, a
300 percent increase over 1985, according to Israeli government
figures. Japan, meanwhile, relies on oil from the Arab Middle East
for much of its fuel needs.
   Arafat, here on a four-day visit, is expected to discuss his
views on the Middle East peace process in meetings set for Tuesday
with Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and Foreign Minister Taro
Nakayama.
   Officials have said Arafat was invited as chairman of the
Palestine Liberation Organization, not as president of the
self-proclaimed state of Palestine. Though Arafat had visited Japan
in 1981, he was then a guest of legislators, not the government.
   Foreign Ministry officials said the government invitation was
intended to show Japan's appreciation for Arafat's denunciation of
violence in December. One official said the formal invitation also
was aimed at bolstering Arafat's moderate policy amid reported
pressures from PLO hard-liners advocating a return to terrorist
tactics.
   Later today, Arafat was to attend a ceremony to rename the PLO's
Tokyo office the ``Permanent Mission of Palestine.''
   Japanese officials said the government approved the renaming
with the understanding that the office's legal status would remain
unchanged. Japan is the third country to allow such a renaming,
following France and Italy.
   Japan, like the United States and other Western industrialized
countries, holds that Palestine has yet to meet generally accepted
international law criteria for statehood. Japan has full diplomatic
relations with Israel.
   The PLO was created in 1964, bringing together several competing
Palestinian groups, including Arafat's Al Fatah.
   By 1970, it was conducting guerrilla and terrorist operations
against Israel from bases inside neighboring Jordan. The PLO
currently is based in Tunisia.

   Three people died in weekend gang violence
despite a police crackdown on street hoodlums that resulted in more
than 1,000 arrests, authorities said.
   Gilmar Arias, 19, was found shot to death in the city's harbor
area about 9 a.m. Sunday, said Los Angeles Police Officer Jim
Farris. Arias apparently was the victim of a drive-by shooting.
   Nelson R. Alas, 15, an alleged gang member, was shot and killed
early Sunday in Hollywood, said Detective Bill Humphry. Alas and
another youth were on a bicycle when they were confronted by
members of a rival gang.
   A 25-year-old man died early Saturday in a drive-by killing in
Pacoima, about 15 miles north of downtown Los Angeles, Police Sgt.
Al Yarborough said.
   The man's name was not released.
   Seven people were injured in gang-related attacks, police said.
   Of the 1,092 people arrested, 629 were gang members, police
said. There were 624 arrests Saturday night and 468 arrests on
Friday.
   Most of the arrests were for investigation of misdemeanors,
including drunken driving, narcotics possession and curfew
violations. Police seized 18 guns, 16 of them owned by gang members.

Voice were made at dinner party, not during interview.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Comedian Jackie Mason, who apologized last week
for racial remarks about mayoral candidate David Dinkins,
previously used a slur against the black Democrat in talking to
Newsweek writers, the magazine says.
   Mason called Dinkins ``a fancy shvartze with a mustache,''
Newsweek reported in this week's edition.
   Shvartze is a Yiddish word for a black person. It is often
considered derogatory.
   The Newsweek report followed Mason's resignation last week from
Republican mayoral candidate Rudolph Giuliani's campaign amid an
uproar over remarks Mason made about blacks and published in the
weekly newspaper Village Voice. The remarks were made at a dinner
party at which a Voice writer was present.
   The Voice quoted Mason, an ordained rabbi, as saying Jewish
support for Dinkins was based on guilt because Jews were ``sick
with complexes.''
   The Newsweek remark was made almost a month before the Voice
article appeared.
   Newsweek said that after Mason made his remark about Dinkins to
the writers at a luncheon, Giuliani joined in the laughter and
didn't rebuke Mason.
   Last week, in reacting to Mason's comments published in the
Voice, Giuliani said he had never heard Mason speak that way before.
   On Sunday, Giuliani denied hearing the remark and questioned the
Newsweek article.
   ``As I recall there were four reporters there. I emphasize that
the four reporters did not report it, which means they didn't hear
it or they didn't attach any significance to it at the time,''
Giuliani said.
   Charles Perkins, a Giuliani spokesman, said he heard the remark
and mentioned it to Giuliani, who told Mason's manager ``he thought
it was inappropriate and Jackie should be more careful with his
language.''
   The editor of Newsweek, Maynard Parker, was quoted in today's
New York Times as saying if he had known about the remark at the
time, ``We would have published it four weeks ago.''
   Dinkins, told that Giuliani said he had not heard the remark,
said: ``Put down, `He smiled.'''

   This past year might have been the best for
actress Roseanne Barr's career, but as far as her personal life
went, the rotund comedian says it was ``the hardest year I ever
lived through.''
   ``I lost my marriage, my children got very messed up. Then in a
three-month period I ended up with a new man, a new daughter, a new
house,'' the star of ``Roseanne'' said in this week's People
magazine.
   The new man is longtime friend Tom Arnold. The new daughter is
Brandi Brown, now 17, who Barr gave up for adoption as an infant.
The girl was located by a tabloid newspaper and Barr arranged a
reunion.
   ``She's a real cool kid,'' Barr said. ``I saw a lot of me in
her.''
   Barr and Arnold are planning to marry Jan. 20, three days after
Barr's divorce from Bill Pentland, her husband of 16 years, becomes
final.
   ``I told Tom I'm out to lose 40 pounds or I ain't gettin'
married. He's trying to lose 20,'' she said.
   ABC's Roseanne led the A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings in its season
premiere last month. Barr plays a blue-collar mom who _ until she
quit in the season finale last spring _ worked in a plastics
factory. She has three rambunctious kids and a husband who's
usually out of work.

   A church deacon accused of shooting two fellow
churchmen to death and wounding a third had just read from the
Bible to boys in his Sunday school class and exhorted, ``be a
winner.''
   Investigators didn't know the subject of an argument during a
deacons' meeting that led to the shootings at the Living Testimony
Baptist Church on Sunday afternoon, said police Sgt. Jim Chandler.
   Deacon Gerald King, 30, was being sought today for investigation
of murder.
   Witnesses said that after a service afternoon, four deacons went
into a room where donations usually are counted. About five minutes
later, church members heard shouting, followed by a series of
gunshots.
   People in the church ``just started running and screaming, `He
shot them!''' said Arveletta Taylor.
   Police said King was driven from the church by his wife.
   ``When he came out, his wife asked him what was wrong,'' Ms.
Taylor said. ``She threw him into the car and drove off.''
   Churchgoers said King had read fron the Bible to his Sunday
school class and urged boys to make something of themselves.
   Head deacon Jack Earl Ray, 51, died at Methodist Medical Center
with a gunshot wound to the chest.
   Deacon Artis Weaver, 60, died at Parkland Memorial Hospital,
also from a gunshot wound to the chest, authorities said.
   Billy Weaver, 39, Artis' nephew, was in fair condition at a
local hospital with a gunshot wound to the lower back, officials
said.

<HEAD>Inquiry Shifts From Terrorism to Personality Grudge in Van Bombing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal investigators now believe someone with
a grudge against the USS Vincennes' former skipper, not
revenge-minded terrorists, may have bombed the van his wife drove,
according to published reports.
   The FBI probe has shifted its focus to the possibility that the
March 10 bombing was carried out by a U.S. citizen, unconnected
with the military, who has a personal vendetta against Capt. Will
C. Rogers III, The San Diego Union reported today. The paper quoted
a Navy official who asked to remain anonymous.
   Federal agents have identified such an individual and are
checking his alibis, but no further identification or elaboration
was available, a Justice Department official said.
   The Los Angeles Times quoted four unidentified sources Sunday
who also said the FBI probe is focusing on the personal vendetta
theory. Two of those sources said the individual being investigated
was a U.S. citizen.
   The pipe bomb explosion drew national attention because
investigators initially interpreted it as terrorist retribution for
the mistaken downing eight months earlier of an Iranian commercial
jetliner by the Vincennes, an Aegis-class guided missile cruiser
commanded by Rogers.
   All 290 people aboard the plane died.
   Rogers' wife, Sharon, was alone in the van but got out uninjured
moments before it was destroyed by fire at an intersection near the
couple's home in San Diego, where the Vincennes is based.
   Tom Hughes, FBI special agent in charge in San Diego, refused to
discuss any aspect of the six-month probe. ``We will have the same
position we have in any ongoing investigation,'' he said, ``and
that is `no comment.'''
   Rogers expressed surprise at the possibility of a personal
motive in the attack, saying, ``I have not the remotest idea of
anyone who would take a personal vendetta against me or my family.''

   An Oslo-bound train with 125 passengers
aboard collided with a truck and derailed on Sweden's west coast
today, killing four people and injuring 22, police said.
   The train had originated in Hamburg, West Germany and the
collision occurred at Varobacka, 25 miles south of Goteborg at 7:10
a.m., said police spokeswoman Marina Larsson said.
   Most of the injured were Swedish. Ten were seriously injured and
one was in critical condition.
   ``The engine is standing beside the rails and the four first
cars have derailed and overturned,'' Jan Sjostedt, head of the
rescue operation, said on the Swedish Radio.
   A local radio reporter, Mats Wetterlund, said the train driver
survived the accident. He quoted the driver as saying he had
desperately tried to catch the truck driver's attention before
plowing into the vehicle.
   Wetterlund said there was virtually nothing left of the truck,
which was crushed and caught fire. It was assumed one of the dead
was the driver.
   Police, firefighters and ambulances were sent to the accident
site from Varberg, just south of Varobacka. The injured were taken
to the town's hospital, police said.
   The train carried nine cars, most of them sleepers, said Alf
Tornberg, head of the information department at the Swedish State
Railways in Goteborg. He said the derailed cars were all sleepers.

<HEAD>Church President Too Frail To Offer Customary Closing Remarks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the first time in his four-year
ministry, 90-year-old Mormon Church President Ezra Taft Benson was
too feeble to provide the traditional closing address to the
faithful, a church official said.
   ``He has not felt he would speak in this session,'' Gordon B.
Hinckley, Benson's first counselor, said Sunday before the church's
159th Semiannual General Conference ended.
   In recent conferences, Benson, a former U.S. agriculture
secretary, has either delivered or had read for him at least two
talks over two days. Benson's sole address this weekend was a
Saturday sermon on the elderly read for him by Thomas H. Monson,
his second counselor.
   During a session on the priesthood Saturday night, Benson,
seemingly confused, arose and walked to the podium during a sermon
by Hinckley, who cut his remarks short. Benson then said ``amen''
and was helped to his seat.
   Mormon presidents, considered by church members to be prophets,
serve for life.
   On Sunday, members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles recalled
Mormonism's pioneer heritage of hardship and devotion as they
praised the modern faithful for their self-sacrifice.
   By giving 10 percent of their income to the church, by serving
full-time missions or by remaining at home with young children,
Mormons today are exhibiting the same tenacity as church founder
Brigham Young and his followers, said Elder Dallin H. Oaks.
   ``In every nation, in every worthy occupation and activity,
members of this church face hardships, overcome obstacles and
follow the servants of the Lord Jesus Christ as valiantly as the
pioneers of any age,'' Oaks said.
   Oaks also touched on what was a prominent theme of the
gathering: obedience to the all-male hierarchy of The Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
   ``In our day, as in the days of earlier pioneers, those in the
lead wagons set the direction and signal onward, but it is the
faithful men and women in the wagons which follow that provide the
momentum and motive power for this great work,'' said Oaks.
   None of the speakers at the conference in the Tabernacle on
Temple Square referred directly to last month's excommunication of
George P. Lee, the first high church official in 46 years to have
his membership revoked.
   The church said Lee, a Navajo Indian who has differed with some
church officials in interpreting the Indians' role in the church,
was cut off for apostasy, or abandonment of faith, and conduct
unbecoming a church member.
   The leadership in the Mormon church is headed by the
three-member First Presidency, followed by the Quorum of the Twelve
Apostles, which supervises the First Quorum of the Seventy, the
group to which Lee belonged. Members of the three panels are known
as general authorities.

<TEXT>
   A 42-foot sailboat missing for
almost four months with four men aboard, including an American,
washed ashore with all crew members safe, a relative said today.
   The three-hulled sailboat overturned in heavy seas in early June
and the four survived by collecting rainwater and eating fish,
seaweed and apples, said Malcolm Tomes, brother-in-law of the
boat's skipper.
   The missing boat, the Rose Noelle, washed ashore on Great
Barrier Island about 60 miles northeast of Auckland late Saturday,
Tomes said.
   The boat left Picton, on the northern coast of New Zealand's
South Island, on June 1. The crew planned a three-week Pacific
Islands cruise that was to take them as far as Tonga.
   On board was the boat's owner and skipper, New Zealander John
Glennie, an experienced sailor who designed the boat for
long-distance cruising; Phillip Hoffman and Rick Hellriegel of New
Zealand; and Jim Nalepka, 38, of Minneapolis, Minn., who was in the
second of two years as caterer for the Outward Bound program in New
Zealand.
   Nalepka's sister, Kathy Moynihan of New Brighton, Minn., said
her family was overjoyed.
   ``We never gave up hope. He kept hoping he was safe. ...This is
wonderful,'' she said.
   Glennie said today that late on June 3, a strong southerly wind
grew to a 60-knot gale.
   ``About six o'clock in the morning there was a huge wave, and it
just flipped the boat upside down,'' Glennie said.
   The Rose-Noelle floated on its crossbeams, with the cabin top
about two feet below water, he said. The craft was stable and would
not sink unless it had broken apart, Glennie said.
   The boat was reported missing on June 24, after it failed to
arrive in Tonga. The last radio contact with the crew came on June
9 from near the Kermadec Islands, about 620 miles northeast of New
Zealand.
   The four survivors, who are all in good health, on Saturday
spent their first night on land in 120 days. On Sunday, they broke
into an empty cabin, where they found warm clothes.
   John Dalmeida, head of the Outward Bound school in Anakiwa, New
Zealand, told the Star Tribune of Minneapolis that the four planned
to go to Auckland to a hospital for tests.
   ``I received a collect call from someone named Jim,'' Dalmeida
said. ``We weren't going to accept it at first. We don't have a Jim
working here anymore....but it turned out to be him. None of us
could believe it. He said, `We're alive. Do I still have my job?'''
   ``They said it is a long, miraculous story,'' said Dalmeida.
``They spent lots of time praying, as you might imagine, and when
they hit land they couldn't believe they were saved.''
   Peter Speck, an island resident, was first to meet the tired
sailors at the cabin.
   ``At first I thought these guys were nuts,'' said Speck. ``They
were talking about being upside down for four months. I couldn't
believe it.''
   Their families had given them up for dead, Tomes said.``We were
absolutely ecstatic to hear John's voice on the phone.''

<TEXT>
   Lebanese leaders met for a third day
today in an effort to end their country's 14-year-old civil war,
but they remained deeply divided over the Syrian army's presence in
Lebanon.
   Saudi officials sought to smooth over the differences as the 63
deputies of Lebanon's National Assembly convened in this Saudi
Arabian mountain resort.
   Conference sources conceded that discord between the 33
Christian and 30 Moslem deputies, largely mirroring the sectarian
divide in Lebanon, was hampering progress.
   Druse Moslem chieftain Walid Jumblatt and Shiite Moslem leader
Nabih Berri, Syria's main allies in Lebanon, oppose a peace plan
proposed by the Arab League because they claim proposed political
reforms do not go far enough in stripping the Christians of their
long-held domination of government, parliament, the judiciary and
army.
   The two warlords, whose support will be essential for any
agreement reached in Taif, flew to Tehran Sunday night for talks
with Iranian leaders. Iran is Syria's ally.
   Tehran Radio, monitored in Cyprus, quoted Berri as expressing
``strong opposition'' to the Arab League plan.
   Despite the political problems, a cease-fire called by the Arab
League Sept. 22 to end six months of fierce artillery battles
between the Syrians and Christians seemed to be holding.
   In Beirut today, Syrian troops and their militia allies fired on
a Lebanese military helicopter trying to rescue the pilot of an air
force jet fighter that crashed in the Mediterranean off north
Lebanon, military sources said.
   Syrian troops in speedboats later picked up the pilot,
identified as Maj. George Sirhal, and took him to the
Syrian-controlled northern port of Tripoli, the sources said. The
Syrians promised to return him.
   The Syrian Army, which has 40,000 troops in Lebanon, controls 70
percent of the Mediterranean country. It entered Lebanon in 1976, a
year after the civil war broke out, under an Arab League
peacekeeping mandate.
   Conference sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a
sizeable group of parliamentarians, mostly Moslems, want the
Syrians to remain in Lebanon.
   Others proposed a phased Syrian withdrawal from Moslem sectors
of Beirut to the Bekaa Valley in east Lebanon, the Syrians' main
stronghold, over two years while the country's constitutional
structure, virtually dismantled by the war, is rebuilt.
   ``Who would take over the responsibility of keeping law and
order if the Syrians left with the (Lebanese) army divided?'' said
Zaher Khatib, a Sunni Moslem.
   But most of the Christian deputies, backed by some Moslems
allied with Iraq, Syria's archrival in the Arab world, demanded an
immediate Syrian withdrawal.
   ``The Syrian military presence in Lebanon is illegimate ... the
Syrians should be made to withdraw from Lebanon within a short
period,'' said George Saadeh, a Maronite who leads the right-wing
Phalange Party.
   Christian leader Gen. Michel Aoun has opposed accepting
political reforms aimed at giving Moslems an equal share of power
with the long-dominant Christians, until the Syrians pull out.
   The Taif meeting, the first by Lebanon's parliament outside
Lebanese territory, was convened by the Arab League to negotiate
political reforms and formulate a ``national reconciliation
charter.''

   An earthquake measuring 4.2 on the Richter

   Avi Shapira, the head of Israel's Seismological Institute, said
the earthquake originated in the waters off the coastal Lebanese
city of Sidon.
   The effects of the quake were felt as far south as Israel's main

   The earthquake was registered at 1:45 p.m. (7:45 EDT) and lasted
10 seconds.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an

<TEXT>
   Former Secretary of State Alexander Haig, one of
the few prominent Americans to visit China since it crushed a
pro-democracy movement, urged the country today to keep its doors
open to the West.
   Haig, in a speech delivered to a business symposium, stressed
that relations between China and the United States, now at a low
ebb, are fundamental for Asian stability.
   ``The Chinese people should continue to look outward for their
own benefit and for the benefit of both the region and the world,''
Haig said at an economic cooperation symposium hosted by the China
International Trust and Investment Corp.
   Haig, one of the most prominent Americans to visit China since
the June military crackdown, has been given a warm welcome here. He
was invited to sit at the head table with Premier Li Peng during a
National Day reception Saturday, and he joined China's top leaders
on the Tiananmen Square rostrum for a 40th anniversary show Sunday
evening.
   Washington curtailed high-level official contacts to protest the
June violence, in which troops killed hundreds and perhaps
thousands of people in Beijing during suppression of crush
pro-democracy demonstrations.
   Haig, a private citizen, is now president of the international
advisory firm Worldwide Associates.
   ``Danger, setback and upheaval are the constant companions of
economic change,'' Haig said. ``Yet the wisest course, however
troubled in the short term, is the one that offers the most
progress for the greatest number.
   ``That is why we all support the Chinese resolve to continue
with the program of economic reform.''
   The conservatives now in control in Beijing have pledged that
there will be no change in China's policy of economic reform.
   However, a retrenchment policy that began when inflation and
growth got out of hand last fall and accelerated after the June
events has raised fears that China is returning to reliance on
central control of the economy.
   Haig devoted a large part of his speech to making the point that
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is now carrying out reforms
in his country because the West forced the Soviet military hand.
   ``Gorbachev's `new thinking' was therefore in my judgment the
product of a realistic analysis that the lagging Soviet economy
could not bear the additional burden of a dead-ended and isolated
foreign policy.''
   Haig warned that even today, the Soviets produce half of all the
world's military material and its forces are still largely
offensive.
   ``Let us be careful that in the course of what may be a
compulsive, competitive frenzy of disarmament that at the end we
are not worse off than we were before,'' he said.

<HEAD>Segregated Church Allows Blacks To Attend Service</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SELMA, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>

   A black student praised the congregation of
an all-white church that allowed him to attend worship services
after turning him away the week before.
   ``They are good people,'' the Rev. Vincent Taylor of Akron, Ohio
said after attending services Sunday at Central Baptist Church.
``The church needs to be commended.''
   Taylor, a 24-year-old divinity student at Selma University, was
joined by three other black men who walked into the sanctuary
before the start of services at the 1,300-member church.
   ``The church has allowed Christ to prevail and the gates of hell
to be defeated,'' he said. There were no incidents and the men were
greeted warmly on the front steps as they prepared to leave.
   ``This is a wonderful, great day,'' said the church's pastor,
the Rev. George Jones.
   He said the 18-member board of deacons met Friday night and
``made the decision to seat anyone who comes to worship.''
   The full congregation will vote Oct. 11 on whether to back the
deacons, he said. The formal policy of not admitting blacks dates
from the days of civil rights demonstrations in the 1960s.
   ``I cannot speak for the congregation, (but) I think if it's
ever rescinded, now is the time it would be,'' the pastor said.
   On Sept. 24, Taylor and two women students at the predominately
black Christian college arrived at the church planning to attend
the service, but a deacon told them the church had a policy
excluding them from worshiping there.
   Taylor said he was ``shocked and encouraged'' Saturday when a
telephone call to Jones revealed a change in the policy. After the
service, he called Jones ``a great preacher.''
   Taylor said much of the controversy over his bid to attend
services at Central Baptist had been blown out of proportion. He
also denied ever saying that a $50 bet with one of his professors
prompted him to seek entry.

<HEAD>Liability Trial in Northwest Crash Begins</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEOFFREY HAYNES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jury selection got under way today in the
liability trial in the 1987 Northwest Airlines crash that killed
156 people, with lawyers prepared to battle over who is to blame
for the tragic outcome of Flight 255.
   The trial before District Judge Julian Cook, expected to take
four to six months, will feature about 4,000 exhibits, including
shredded plane parts and hundreds of photographs.
   At issue is whether Northwest or the maker of the MD-80 plane,
McDonnell Douglas Corp., or both, are liable in the fiery Aug. 16,
1987, crash.
   ``Expect a major battle between McDonnell Douglas and Northwest,
trying to blame it on each other,'' said Richard Schaden of
Birmingham, one of five attorneys serving on a steering committee
representing about 100 plaintiffs.
   ``It's such a hotly contested liability issue. Neither one will
admit liability, and that's rare,'' Schaden said.
   A National Transportation Safety Board report on the crash near
Detroit Metropolitan Airport said the pilots failed to properly set
the wing flaps and slats before takeoff.
   The Phoenix-bound plane, never able to gain altitude, slammed
into an Interstate 94 entrance ramp, killing 154 people on board
and two people on the ground. The sole plane survivor was Cecelia
Cichan, then 4, who lost her parents and brother and now lives with
relatives in Alabama.
   Some relatives of crash victims said they would be at court
every day. Betty Polec, an organizer of the support group Flight
255: Their Spirit Lives On, said the amount offered in out-of-court
settlements so far has been ``an insult.''
   ``I want my day in court,'' Polec said. ``My opinion is if you
settle with the underwriter, you are patting them on the back and
saying everything is OK. I want them punished.''
   Northwest spokesman Doug Miller said the airline believes
McDonnell Douglas is partially to blame in the accident.
   Schaden, who will be responsible for arguing the case against
McDonnell Douglas, said he will discuss defects he thinks
contributed to the crash, including a disconnected or faulty
circuit breaker on the flap- and slats-warning system and an
indicator that was supposed to tell pilots if the takeoff warning
system wasn't working.
   Countered McDonnell Douglas spokesman Don Hanson: ``There was no
problem with the aircraft. The aircraft is and was perfectly safe.''
   Disagreements over liability have made out-of-court settlements
with the relatives of victims slow in coming, attorneys for the
plaintiffs say. Northwest attorney Carroll Dubuc said in August
that 46 cases had been resolved out of court and negotiations were
continuing in others. He didn't return repeated phone calls last
week to his Washington office.
   Dubuc said then that 102 suits were still pending.
   ``I think going to trial with as many plaintiffs as we have is
kind of unusual,'' said Jerry Skinner, who represents the
plaintiffs.
   Northwest also has filed a suit against McDonnell Douglas, Texas
Instruments and National Car Rental, saying they are partially
responsible in the crash.
   Texas Instruments manufactured a circuit breaker used in a
warning system that alerts pilots when the flaps and slats aren't
set for takeoff. National Car Rental owned a light pole that
Northwest claims was higher than the legal limit, Miller said. The
plane struck the light pole as it struggled to lift off at the end
of the runway.
   That suit is expected to be heard after the liability trial.

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five bombs presumably set off by drug
traffickers exploded in three Colombian cities and injured at least
four people, police said today.
   On Sunday, Ecuador said it had deported a top drug suspect to
Colombia and Bogota newspapers said the army seized guns and cash
at the home of another reputed cocaine kingpin.
   National police in Bogota said three people were wounded when
three bombs exploded Sunday in the western city of Cali, home of a
powerful cocaine cartel. Another person was injured when a bomb
exploded in the northern city of Sincelejo. An explosion in the
capital caused no injuries.
   A 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew was ordered in Sincelejo, where four
other bombs were found and deactivated, the Colombian radio chain
RCN said.
   In Ecuador, Interior Minister Andres Vallejo was quoted as
saying that ``Drug traffickers should know that they can't hide in
Ecuador.''
   An official statement released late Sunday said suspected drug
dealer Evaristo Porras Ardila was sent back to Colombia earlier in
the day but gave no details.
   Porras was ranked No. 8 on a list of traffickers who were
most-wanted in Colombia's 6-week-old war on the nation's cocaine
cartels.
   He is not, however, among the 12 Colombians the United States
wants extradited to face drug charges. None of the 12 has been
captured.
   Porras was arrested in Quito, Ecuador's capital, on Wednesday,
according to the government statement. Since 1987, he had lived in
that country under an assumed name and was president of Ecuamer, an
import-export enterprise, the statement said.
   Vallejo earlier said Porras was to be sent to the border, where
he would be met by Colombian police. The Bogota daily El Tiempo
reported that four detectives were sent to bring Porras back to
Colombia.
   El Espectador, another Bogota daily, quoted an unidentified
police official as saying 500 officers and soldiers tried to
capture another major trafficking suspect in a raid Saturday 50
miles north of the capital.
   But as the army and police closed in, two helicopters flew away
from the suspected hideout of Jose Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, the
newspaper said.
   Rodriguez Gacha, 42, a leading figure in the Medellin cocaine
cartel, is on the U.S. Justice Department's list of the 12
most-wanted drug figures. He faces drug-trafficking, conspiracy and
racketeering charges in Florida and New York.
   The cartel is headquartered in Colombia's second-largest city of
the same name. The Medellin and Cali drug cartels are thought
responsible for 80 percent of cocaine entering U.S. markets.
   Saturday's raid was near the town of Pacho, where troops last
month seized 18 ranches belonging to Rodriguez, El Espectador said.
Police seized $196,000 in burlap bags and 40 guns, El Espectador
said.
   President Virgilio Barco began the crackdown on drug lords Aug.
19, one day after the assassination of the leading presidential
candidate, Luis Carlos Galan, who led a crusade against drug
traffickers in Medellin.
   Cocaine barons responded by declaring war on the government,
initiating bombings, slayings and other attacks. In the past month,
Colombians have been terrorized by 127 explosions that have killed
10 people and injured 148.
   The drug bosses hope to intimidate the government into
abandoning its pledge to extradite narcotics traffickers, who enjoy
relative impunity under the Colombian justice system, through
payoffs or intimidation.
   So far, one suspect has been extradited and proceedings are
under way against a second.

<HEAD>Pope, Runcie Sign Declaration on Seeking Unity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY BETH SHERIDAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II and Anglican leader Robert
Runcie pledged today to search for unity but noted that the
Anglican ordination of women remains an obstacle to healing the
churches' 400-year-old schism.
   ``We solemnly recommit ourselves and those we represent to the
restoration of visible unity and full ecclesial communion,'' said a
declaration they signed at the end of Runcie's first official visit
to the Vatican.
   Runcie, who as archbishop of Canterbury is spiritual head of the
state Church of England and leader of the world's 70 million
Anglicans, said the commitment to continue talks on unification
with the 850 million Roman Catholics should not be dismissed as ``a
pure academic exercise.''
   Runci told a news conference that his four-day trip allowed him
to build trust with Vatican officials and discuss ways to revive
and spread religious practice.
   Vatican officials also promised to respond soon to a 7-year-old
report by an Anglican-Catholic commission outlining possible
theological agreements between the churches, he said. Anglican
bishops have accepted the report.
   Vatican and Anglican officials have been holding talks since
1966 on unifying their churches, which split four centuries ago
over the pope's refusal to annul King Henry VIII's marriage to
Catherine of Aragon.
   The new declaration noted problems raised in recent years by the
ordination of women in some of the Anglican Communion's 27
self-governing provinces, including the U.S. Episcopal Church.
   ``The question and practice of the admission of women to the
ministerial priesthood in some provinces of the Anglican Communion
prevents rerconciliation between us even where there is otherwise
progress toward agreement in faith on the meaning of the Eucharist
and the ordained ministry,'' the declaration said.
   However, Cardinal Johannes Willebrands, president of the
Vatican's Council for Promoting Christian Unity, told the news
conference: ``This meeting has absolutely not been dominated by the
theme of the ordination of women.''
   He called the ordination issue an obstacle ``to be considered
and overcome.''

<BYLINE>Supreme Court Refuses to Revive Maryland Suit About Foster Home
^By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to revive an
allegedly abused foster child's federal lawsuit against the social
workers and government agency that placed him in his foster home.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a federal appeals court
ruling in a Maryland case that no such right to sue exists.
   Charles Milburn Jr., now 20, was not quite 2 years old when in
1971 the Anne Arundel County Department of Social Services placed
him with foster parents Karl and Wendy Tucker of Glen Burnie.
   His parents voluntarily had placed him in the custody of the
social services agency.
   Milburn's federal lawsuit against the Tuckers, individual social
workers and the county agency said he was subjected to physical
abuse for nearly two years before being removed from the Tuckers'
home.
   The suit, which sought $66 million in damages, said his injuries
included two leg fractures, a facial laceration and severe burns
that left his hands permanently scarred and disabled.
   The suit alleged that Mrs. Tucker, with her husband's knowledge,
inflicted all the injuries _ including her immersing the
youngster's hands in boiling water.
   Milburn's suit, based on alleged violations of his
constitutional due-process rights, was thrown out by U.S. District
Judge Joseph C. Howard, and the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
upheld the dismissal last March 31.
   Such lawsuits must establish that the alleged harm was caused by
the government or some government agent. The 4th Circuit ruled that
the Tuckers did not fit the definition of government agents.
   ``The state of Maryland was not responsible for ... the
(alleged) physical child abuse itself,'' the appeals court said.
``It exercised no coercive power over the Tuckers; neither did it
encourage them.''
   The appeals court noted that a parallel lawsuit filed in state
court, alleging Maryland tort law violations, is awaiting action.
   The Supreme Court last February ruled that public officials may
not be sued in federal court when their alleged gross negligence
permits a child to be abused by a parent.
   That decision in a Wisconsin case said a state does not have a
constitutional duty to protect people, including abused children,
who are not in the state's custody.
   Writing for the court then, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist
said, ``As a general matter, we conclude that a state's failure to
protect an individual against private violence simply does not
constitute a violation of the (Constitution's) due process clause.''
   That constitutional provision bars deprivation of life, liberty
and property without due process of law.
   A footnote in the February decision, however, said the justices
were leaving undecided whether due-process considerations would
arise in the case of children abused by foster parents.
   The case is Milburn vs. Anne Arundel County Department of Social
Services, 89-96.

   Clashes between two political factions
vying to lead Namibia into independence left two people dead and at
least 30 injured, officials and news reports said today.
   A 27-year-old man was clubbed to death when he and four friends
stopped at a small shop in the northern town of Oshakati on
Saturday, said Gerhard Roux, spokesman for Namibia's adminstrator,
Louis Pienaar.
   Roux said the victim and his friends were supporters of the
Democratic Turnhalle Alliance and were attacked by about 80 backers
of the South-West Africa People's Organization, the party favored
in the country's elections next month.
   Also, a SWAPO supporter was beaten to death in Oshakati and the
homes and shops of party members were attacked in northern towns
during the weekend, The Star of Johannesburg said.
   Roux said at least 30 people were hurt Sunday, one critically,
when people disrupted rallies held by the Democratic Turnhalle
alliance around Oshakati.
   The clashes included gunfire, grenades, fires and looting,
according to the South-West Africa Broadcasting Corp., which is
controlled by the South African government.
   The elections are for the national assembly that will be
empowered to draw up a constitution for Namibia, which has been
ruled by South Africa for 74 years.
   South Africa, which agreed to relinquish control of Namibia
under a regional peace accord, has not announced a date for
independence but it is expected to be early next year.
   The predominantly black SWAPO, which waged a 23-year bush war
against South African rule, is a leftist-leaning party that draws
its strongest support from the Ovambo people of northern Namibia.
   The alliance, a moderate, multiracial coalitiion, is expected to
be the second-leading vote getter out of the 10 parties contesting
the race.
   There have been sporadic cases of violence since the election
campaign began formally in July, and it has increased as the
election nears.

<HEAD>Court to Decide If Witnesses May Make Public Testimony in Florida
Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether states may prohibit grand jury witnesses from making public
their own testimony once the investigation has ended.
   The justices said they will review an attempt by Florida
officials to block a former newspaper reporter from disclosing
details of his appearance before a grand jury three years ago.
   A federal appeals court said a state law barring such public
disclosure violates free-speech rights.
   Michael Smith, a former reporter for the Charlotte Herald-News
in Charlotte County, Fla., wants to publish a news story and
possibly a book about a 1986 grand jury investigation into
allegations of corruption in the county sheriff's department and
the county's state attorney office.
   The grand jury probe ended in 1986, and no indictments were
handed down.
   Smith's lawyer, in an interview with The Associated Press, said
Smith was subjected to ``abusive'' questioning by a state attorney
when appearing before the grand jury.
   Smith no longer is a reporter and no longer lives in Florida,
said his lawyer, Gregg Thomas of Tampa.
   Concerned that he could be charged with a crime for disclosing
his grand jury information, Smith sued in an effort to have the
Florida law overturned.
   A federal trial judge upheld the law and threw out Smith's suit.
But the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled for Smith.
   The appeals court said the Florida law violates free-speech
rights ``as it applies to witnesses who speak about the nature of
their own grand jury testimony after the investigation has been
completed.''
   Such a ``permanent and absolute obligation of secrecy'' is not
justified, the appeals court said.
   Florida Attorney General Robert Butterworth then sought Supreme
Court review, arguing that the 11th Circuit court's ruling
sacrifices the grand jury secrecy that shields the reputations of
innocent people.
   ``A tradition steeped in American jurisprudence has been cast
aside despite the fact that the termination of one investigation
does not necessarily mean that the testimony gathered during that
investigation may not generate further investigations,''
Butterworth told the justices.
   Smith urged the court to reject the state's appeal, noting that
most states and the federal government impose no such permanent
restraints on grand jury witnesses.
   ``Florida's rule of blanket secrecy ... cannot be
constitutionally justified,'' Smith contended.
   The case is Butterworth vs. Smith, 88-1993.

<HEAD>Maryland Club That Won't Admit Women Fails To Regain Tax Break</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A golf club that has counted presidents and
members of Congress among its members failed today in a Supreme
Court bid to regain a tax break revoked because of the club's
refusal to admit women as members.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that Maryland
officials did not violate the rights of Burning Tree Club members
by scraping a tax break worth more than $300,000 a year.
   Burning Tree has 440 members and is located just outside the
nation's capital in the affluent suburb of Bethesda, Md., The club
had a long-term agreement with the state to preserve its open
spaces in return for favorable property-tax treatment.
   But in 1986, the Maryland Legislature canceled the agreement.
The club, an all-male bastion since its founding in 1922, was told
it must either admit women or have its land taxed at full value.
   Maryland officials also said the club's refusal to admit women
violated the state's Equal Rights Amendment enacted in 1972.
   The Maryland Court of Appeals ruled in March that a law forcing
the club to choose between admitting women or losing its tax break
did not violate the members' freedom-of-association rights.
   The law ``does not even prohibit Burning Tree from
discriminating,'' the state's highest court said. ``It simply
provides that if Burning Tree continues to discriminate, its
property will be assessed in the same manner as the property of
other taxpayers in the area.''
   Burning Tree officials argued their club should be exempt from
recent Supreme Court rulings empowering government officials to end
sex discrimination at such large, national organizations as the
Jaycees and Rotary Clubs.
   Burning Tree's appeal said the club is a more intimate group and
has a limited purpose: providing a ``congenial'' setting for men
devoted to the game of golf.
   The Maryland appeals court, however, ruled that the state is
only withdrawing a benefit, not forcing the club to accept women.
   ``The state is simply declining to subsidize any organization
that engages in discriminatory activities,'' the state court said.
``Just because Burning Tree's members may have associational rights
does not oblige the state to subsidize the exercise of those
rights.''
   A Supreme Court ruling in 1988 gave states and local communities
power to ban sex and race bias at private clubs smaller than the
Jaycees and Rotary. The court upheld a New York City law banning
discrimination by private clubs with more than 400 members.
   Two justices who joined that unanimous opinion, Harry A.
Blackmun and Anthony M. Kennedy, once belonged to male-only clubs.
   The case is Burning Tree vs. Maryland, 88-1970.

<HEAD>High Court Agrees to Review Army School Case From Georgia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether the Army must bargain with unions over the wages and fringe
benefits received by teachers at Army-run schools.
   The court said it will review a ruling that the Army had a legal
duty to bargain with teachers at two Fort Stewart, Ga., schools
attended by children of military personnel.
   The teachers union, an affiliate of the National Education
Association, sought a 13.5 percent wage increase in 1987 and
various fringe benefit improvements for teachers at the two
elementary schools.
   The Federal Labor Relations Authority ordered the Army to
negotiate with the union over the demands, and that order was
upheld in November 1988 by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   The appeals court rejected arguments that the proposed wage hike
and benefit improvements would interfere with the Army's right to
set its own budget.
   ``Although the proposals obligate the Army to spend funds for
salaries in the succeeding fiscal year, the government will
appropriate funds before the Army incurs these obligations,'' the
appeals court said.
   The appeals court also rejected the Army's claim that it should
be permitted to set teacher salaries according to how much teachers
are paid in local public schools.
   There is no compelling need for such comparability, the 11th
Circuit court said.
   In the appeal acted on today, Bush administration lawyers said
other groups of federal workers _ whose salaries are not fixed by
law _ could be affected if the appeals court's approach is adopted
nationwide.
   The appeal said other federal appeals courts have ruled that the
Army is under no such obligation.
   In urging the justices to reject the government's appeal,
lawyers for the teachers union said only a tiny fraction of federal
workers _ less than one percent _ might be affected if the appeals
court's approach prevailed nationwide.
   The case is Fort Stewart Schools vs. Federal Labor Relations
Authority, 89-65.

<HEAD>Afghan Rebels to Lobby For U.N. Seat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Afghan rebels said today they will
send a delegation to New York to lobby for Afghanistan's seat at
the United Nations, which is now occupied by the Soviet-backed
government.
   Najibullah Lafrie, information minister in the guerrillas'
self-proclaimed government-in-exile, said the group also would meet
with U.S. State Department officials to discuss fighting the flow
of heroin from war-torn Afghanistan.
   The four-man delegation, led by the rebels' interior minister,
Yunis Khalis, will be present for the U.N. General Assembly debate
on Afghanistan in late October or early November, the information
minister said.
   The Moslem rebels have yet to achieve any U.N. status.
   Seven resistance parties based in Pakistan formed what they said
was an interim government in February after the Soviet Union
completed its troop withdrawal from Afghanistan.
   The Marxist government in Kabul still controls major cities with
heavy material support from Moscow, but the insurgents virtually
rule the countryside.
   Four Moslem countries officially recognize the rebel government.
But the main backers of the rebels _ Pakistan and the United States
_ do not because it doesn't include several guerrilla groups based
inside Afghanistan and in Iran.
   The information minister said the rebel government would offer
to help stop the flow of opium and its refined derivative, heroin,
from Afghanistan.
   ``Our government shall play an outstanding role in the
elimination of the menace of drugs and narcotics,'' he said.
   The rebels have denied allegations that they occasionally have
traded drugs for weapons in their 11-year-old fight to topple the
Kabul government.
   Afghanistan and northwestern Pakistan have a centuries-old
tradition of opium poppy cultivation.

<TEXT>
   Eight Mafia figures from New York City
convicted in the 1979 murders of crime chieftain Carmine Galante
and two of his associates lost Supreme Court appeals today.
   The court, without comment, let stand the federal racketeering
convictions of family bosses Anthony Salerno, Anthony Corallo and
Carmine Persico, high-ranking mobsters Salvatore Santoro,
Christopher Furnari and Gennaro Langella, and mob members Anthony
Indelicato and Ralph Scopo.
   The racketeering convictions stemmed, in part, from the plotting
of Galante's July 12, 1979 murder at a Brooklyn restaurant. Also
gunned down were Leonard Coppola and Giuseppe Turano.
   Federal prosecutors say there are five distinct Mafia groups in
New York City _ the Genovese, Gambino, Colombo, Lucchese and
Bonanno ``families.''
   Prosecutors say Corallo was boss of the Lucchese family, which
Santoro served as ``underboss'' and Furnari as ``consigliere.''
Persico led the Colombo family and Langella served as his underboss.
   Salerno was boss of the Genovese family; Persico boss of the
Colombo family and Langella its underboss.
   Scopo, a member of the Colombo family, was also president of the
District Council of Cement and Concrete Workers, Laborers
International Union.
   Indelicato, a Bonanno family ``soldier'' promoted after the
Galante killings, was the only defendant accused of participating
in them.
   Evidence at the eight men's 11-week jury trial indicated that
the activities of Mafia families throughout the nation are
coordinated by a ``commission'' which each family boss serves as a
member.
   Through the 1970s, the Bonanno family was not represented
directly on the commission because of internal disputes. Galante
was the Bonanno family boss, and prosecutors said the commission
ordered his murder as a means of resolving the disputes.
   Each of the defendants was convicted of conspiracy in violation
of the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act
(RICO).
   All the defendants except Indelicato received 100-year prison
sentences. He was sentenced to 40 years but that term was reduced
to 20 years on appeal.
   Except for overturning part of Indelicato's conviction, the 2nd
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the RICO conspiracy
convictions last Jan. 31.
   In the appeals acted on today, lawyers for the Mafia figures
argued, among other things, that prosecutors failed to prove a
sufficient connection between the Galante murder and the commission.
   The cases are Indelicato vs. U.S., 88-1881; Salerno vs. U.S.,
88-2060; Persico vs. U.S., 88-2061; Scopo vs. U.S., 88-2071.

<HEAD>Court to Decide Postal Service Soliciting Issue in Maryland Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether the government may prohibit soliciting on all Postal
Service property, including sidewalks adjacent to post office
buildings.
   The justices said they will review a case from Bowie, Md., in
which a federal appeals court struck down the ban as
unconstitutional.
   Other federal appeals courts have upheld the ban.
   Marsha Kokinda and Kevin Pearl were arrested outside the Bowie
post office on Aug. 6, 1986, after they refused to stop soliciting
contributions and distributing literature from a sidewalk table.
   The two are volunteers for the National Democratic Policy
Committee, the political arm of an organization headed by political
extremist Lyndon LaRouche.
   They had set up the table on a sidewalk adjacent to the post
office building.
   The post office in Bowie, like many in suburban and rural
communities, is a freestanding building with its own sidewalk and
parking lot. A municipal sidewalk runs in front of the post office
property, separating the parking lot from the street.
   Ms. Kokinda and Pearl were convicted in a trial before a federal
magistrate of violating a regulation banning ``soliciting,
electioneering, collecting debts, vending and advertising'' on
Postal Service property.
   There was no evidence that the two had blocked or interfered
with people entering and leaving the post office. But postal
officials said they received more than 40 complaints from patrons
during the several hours Ms. Kokinda and Pearl were there.
   Ms. Kokinda was fined $50 and sentenced to 10 days in jail.
Pearl was fined $100 and given a suspended 30-day jail term.
   A federal judge upheld the convictions, but the 4th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals threw them out by a 2-1 vote last Jan. 31.
   The appeals court rejected the government's argument that there
is a difference between city sidewalks and a sidewalk located
entirely on Postal Service property.
   The appeals court called the activities by Ms. Kokinda and Pearl
``classic political speech pursued peacefully in a place that
traditionally has been held open to the public for expressive
activities.''
   Because the sidewalk outside the post office is a ``public
forum,'' the appeals court said, soliciting and other forms of
speech could not be banned ``except by content-neutral time, place
and manner regulations that furthered a significant government
interest.''
   The 4th Circuit court's ruling set a binding legal precedent for
Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and West
Virginia.
   In the appeal acted on today, government lawyers noted that two
other appeals courts have upheld the soliciting ban after ruling
that a sidewalk like the one at issue in Bowie is not a public
forum.
   ``The Postal Service will not be able to enforce a single
nationwide standard to deal with the problem of solicitation and
other forms of speech on the grounds of the 35,000 post office
facilities around the country,'' the appeal said.
   The case is U.S. vs. Kokinda, 88-2031.

<HEAD>Court to Review California Man's Federal Disability Pay</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to consider
making it easier for the government to cut off disability pay to
some former federal workers.
   The court said it will review a ruling that barred termination
of a disability annuity for a California man who was given
incorrect information about benefits eligibility.
   Charles Richmond, a retired Navy welder from National City,
Calif., asked a federal official in 1986 how much money he was
allowed to make as a bus driver without sacrificing his disability
annuity.
   He was told that if his pay for two years exceeded 80 percent of
what his welder's job had paid, he would lose the disability
benefit. Richmond also was given an out-of-date federal manual with
the same information.
   Congress had amended the law in 1982 to cut off annuity payments
to anyone making more than 80 percent of the former government
job's one-year salary.
   Richmond in 1986 did some overtime work as a bus driver and
earned $19,936. Eighty percent of his pay as a Navy welder that
year would have been $19,016.
   When the government cut off his disability annuity because he
exceeded the ceiling, Richmond challenged the decision. He said he
had relied on the misinformation he received from the government.
   A federal appeals court here ordered the annuity restored. The
appeals court said in a ruling last December that the government
recklessly misled Richmond.
   Justice Department lawyers, in appealing to the Supreme Court,
said the government should not be prevented ``from executing the
laws as written by Congress because of the errors of government
agents.''
   The appeal also said Richmond suffered little harm. It accused
him of trying ``to work the system as close to the edge as
possible,'' seeking to keep the annuity while making as much in bus
driver wages as he could.
   The case is Office of Personnel Management vs. Richmond, 88-1943.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether hospitals and nursing care homes may sue in federal court
to challenge how a state-run Medicaid program reimburses their
costs.
   The court said it will review a ruling that would allow a
hospital association to invoke a federal civil rights law in suing
Virginia over the state's Medicaid reimbursement rates.
   The attorneys general of 36 states told the court its ruling,
expected sometime next year, will affect hundreds of millions of
dollars in federal and state funding.
   The Virginia Hospital Association sued the state in 1986,
attacking the state's Medicaid reimbursement rates.
   The lawsuit alleges that the too-low rates violate the federal
Medicaid Act and the due-process rights of participating hospitals.
   Medicaid is paid primarily by the federal government but
individual state agencies administer the program aimed at providing
health care to the poor.
   Virginia officials sought to have the suit dismissed, contending
that only health care recipients _ not individual or associated
health care providers _ have the right to sue under the Medicaid
Act.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected that contention
last Feb. 22 in a decision that set a binding legal precedent for
Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina and West
Virginia.
   Acknowledging that the Medicaid Act does not expressly give
hospitals and nursing care home the right to sue a state, the
appeals court ruled that the right is implied.
   Such suits may be filed under a much-used, Reconstruction era
civil rights law, the 4th Circuit court said.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for Virginia argued that
Congress did not intend to enable hospitals and nursing care homes
to sue over Medicaid rate disputes.
   They also contended that the state should be shielded from such
suits by immunity granted under the Constitution's 11th Amendment.
   A ``friend-of-the-court'' brief written by the Oregon attorney
general's staff and submitted in behalf of 36 states urged the
justices to reverse the 4th Circuit court's ruling.
   The ruling leaves Medicaid providers ``free to attack ... the
reasonableness of each state's reimbursement rates,'' the states'
brief said. ``Every routine rate challenge may be made a federal
case.''
   The case is Baliles vs. Virginia Hospital Association, 88-2043.

   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether federal agencies sometimes must negotiate with employee
unions over what goods and services the government buys from
private businesses.
   The justices said they will resolve conflicting court rulings in
the ``contracting-out'' dispute.
   The appeal granted review today was filed by lawyers for the
Internal Revenue Service, which contends that an agency's power to
contract for the goods and services it needs from private industry
is an exclusive management prerogative not subject to negotiation.
   But the Federal Labor Relations Authority, which adjudicates
collective bargaining disputes between federal agencies and their
employees, ruled against the IRS.
   The authority said grievance and arbitration provisions of the
tax agency's labor contract with the National Treasury Employees
Union apply to disputed contracting-out cases. The authority
ordered the IRS to bargain with the NTEU over the union's proposals.
   A U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel here, by a 2-1 vote,
upheld the FLRA ruling last Feb. 28.
   Other federal appeals courts, however, have ruled that federal
agencies have no such obligation.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the IRS argued that
the FLRA ruling will harm government efficiency.
   ``Under the scenario contemplated by the FLRA, long after an
agency has decided to contract work out and has accordingly entered
into ... a contract with a private entity, the agency may be told
by an arbitrator that the contracting-out decision must be
reconsidered under the conditions that existed when it was made,''
the appeal said.
   ``That prospect is not conducive to efficient agency
management,'' it added.
   FLRA lawyers told the justices that the IRS case was decided
correctly by the appeals court, but the authority did not oppose
the IRS appeal.
   The case is IRS vs. FLRA, 88-2123.

<HEAD>Supreme Court to Consider Reinstatement of Minnesota Man's Murder
Conviction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to consider
reinstating the murder conviction of a Minnesota man who says he
was duped into driving the getaway car in a gas station holdup.
   The court said it will review a ruling that police violated the
man's rights when they arrested him without a warrant at the house
a where he was staying.
   Robert Olson was convicted of murder, armed robbery and assault
in the July 18, 1987, holdup of a Minneapolis gas station. The
station's manager was shot to death. Olson was sentenced to life in
prison plus six years.
   The Minnesota Supreme Court overturned Olson's conviction last
February and granted him a new trial, ruling that he had been the
victim of an unlawful arrest.
   Police, acting on an informant's tip, did not obtain a court
warrant or permission to enter the house where Olson was staying
before they went in and arrested him.
   The fact that Olson was a guest at the home did not deprive him
of privacy rights, the state court said.
   Noting that police said they failed to get a warrant because it
was a Sunday, the state court said that is ``surely a curious
reason for not observing the constitutional safeguards of
citizens.'' The state court also rejected arguments that police
were faced with an emergency.
   Ordering a retrial, the state Supreme Court said prosecutors may
not use a statement Olson made shortly after the arrest in which he
admitted driving the getaway car. Prosecutors said discrepancies in
the statement undermine Olson's claim that he was an innocent dupe
of the man who held up the gas station and shot the manager.
   Minnesota's appeal to the nation's highest court was supported
by the National District Attorneys Association and officials from
10 states: Connecticut, Delaware, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan,
Mississippi, Missouri, New Mexico, South Carolina and Vermont.
   The justices were urged to clarify whether house guests have the
same right against unreasonable police searches and seizures as
people in their own homes.
   The case is Minnesota vs. Olson, 88-1916.

Fees</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether a federal law unfairly makes it too difficult for coal
miners who contract ``black lung'' disease to obtain a lawyer's
help when seeking benefits.
   The justices said they will review a West Virginia Supreme Court
of Appeals ruling that the system for awarding lawyer fees in black
lung benefits cases violates due-process rights.
   Pneumoconiosis, a chronic respiratory and pulmonary disease
commonly called black lung, afflicts numerous coal miners.
   Under the Black Lung Benefits Act, Congress provides benefits to
those miners who become totally disabled because of the disease.
   Those who apply for such benefits are entitled to have a
lawyer's help, and lawyers who assist miners in obtaining benefits
have their fees paid by the coal mine operator, its insurance
carrier or the government.
   To get such fees paid, a lawyer must apply separately to the
Labor Department and to the official that presided over the
application hearing. No fees award is made until a miner receives a
final award of benefits.
   West Virginia lawyer George R. Triplett, beginning in 1978,
entered into contingent-fee agreements to help about 15 miners
seeking black lung benefits. The agreements entitled Triplett to
one-fourth of any back benefits collected by the miners.
   Since the fees Triplett collected between 1978 and 1983 were
never approved by the Labor Department or any court, they were in
violation of Labor Department regulations.
   The West Virginia State Bar's Committee on Legal Ethics in 1987
recommended that the state's highest court enforce a recommended
six-month suspension against Triplett for violating the regulations.
   The state Supreme Court of Appeals, in a 3-2 decision last year,
refused to enforce the suspension.
   The state court said the evidence made clear that most lawyers
are unwilling to represent miners seeking black lung benefits
because of ``inadequate fees'' and the long delays in collecting
them.
   Once a miner is awarded benefits, the state court said, it often
takes ``an additional two years ... for a lawyer to be paid his
fee.'' There is no provision for interest.
   The result, the state court said, is to deny those applying for
black lung benefits ``property without due process of law by
severely restricting their right to obtain competent counsel in the
highly adversarial process of black lung litigation.''
   The West Virginia court's ruling did not bar the Labor
Department's own enforcement of its attorney-fee regulations, but
it knocked out the primary method of enforcing those regulations in
West Virgina _ state bar disciplinary proceedings.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the Labor Department
said, ``The decision below substantially deprives black lung
claimants in West Virginia of the protection against overreaching
and against unjustified dimunition of their benefits that Congress
mandated in regulating attorney's fees.''
   The appeal noted that West Virginia is one of the nation's
principal coal-mining states, and added, ``If not reversed, the
(state court's) decision may also encourage attorneys in other
coal-mining states to flout the black lung fee requirements.''
   The case is Labor Department vs. Triplett, 88-1671.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today set the stage for an
important ruling on political patronage, agreeing to decide whether
public employers may be forced to put aside partisanship when
hiring, promoting and transferring workers.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by two men and a woman who
said their job status suffered because they didn't support the
Republican Party in Illinois.
   The court also agreed to hear a related appeal by Illinois
officials seeking to preserve patronage powers in determining when
government workers may be laid off and rehired.
   Cynthia Rutan, Franklin Taylor and James Moore asked the court
to reinstate their lawsuit against Illinois Gov. James Thompson and
state and local GOP officials.
   They said their rights of free speech and association, protected
by the Constitution's First Amendment, were violated.
   Ms. Rutan said she repeatedly was denied promotions to
supervisory positions in the state Rehabilitative Services
Department because she did not support Republicans candidates.
   Taylor, an equipment operator, allegedly was denied an Illinois
Transportation Department transfer to another county because party
officials opposed it.
   And Moore said the state Corrections Department has refused to
hire him since 1978 because he could not get the backing of key
Republican leaders.
   ``Those who are politically favored are promoted, transferred or
hired,'' they said. ``Those who are not so favored are not
promoted, transferred or hired.''
   They sued for more than $1 billion in damages, and sought to
have control of the state employment system shifted to a
court-appointed federal receiver.
   A federal judge threw out their suit, and the 7th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals, by a 7-2 vote in February, upheld the dismissal.
   The appeals court, relying on a series of Supreme Court
decisions, said public employees enjoy broad First Amendment
protection from being fired or threatened with firing. But the high
court has not extended the same constitutional safeguards to
hiring, promotion and transfer, the appeals court said.
   The Supreme Court, in a 1980 ruling that significantly weakened
the patronage system, said government workers may not be fired
solely because of their political affiliation unless that was an
appropriate requirement for carrying out their jobs.
   The 7th Circuit court said, ``Employment decisions not involving
dismissals ... are significantly less coercive and disruptive than
discharges ...A person denied a promotion or transfer ... still
retains his job and his ability to meet his financial obligations.''
   The appeals court said a judge should be reluctant to intrude
into the political process and become ``a platonic guardian over
state employment systems.''
   Changes in the patronage system are better left to legislatures,
the appeals court added.
   But the appeals court ruled in favor of two workers laid off
from state jobs, saying layoffs are similar in key respects to
firings. It ordered additional hearings in those cases.
   The cases are Rutan vs. Illinois Republican Party, 88-1872, and
Frech vs. Rutan, 88-2074.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to consider
increasing the federal government's power to keep some accused
criminals behind bars while they await trial.
   The court said it will review a ruling in a New Mexico case that
forces the government to free, on bail, some defendants deemed to
be dangerous or a risk to flee before trial.
   A federal appeals court said pretrial release is required _ even
for a defendant who otherwise could be held in custody _ if a
pretrial detention hearing is not held the first time that person
appears before a judge or magistrate.
   The justices in 1987 upheld a federal law allowing denial of
bail before trial to people deemed dangerous to the community, even
if accused of non-violent crimes.
   Before the 1984 law, called the Bail Reform Act, pretrial bail
generally would be denied only if a judge determined the defendant
was likely to flee.
   In practice, however, federal judges could get around the old
law by setting very high bail, ostensibly aimed at guaranteeing the
defendant's appearance in court but effectively keeping the accused
in custody while awaiting trial.
   A provision in the 1984 law states that a hearing to determine
whether pretrial detention is justified must be held ``immediately
upon the person's first appearance before the judicial officer,
unless that person or the attorney for the government seeks a
continuance.''
   A federal trial judge and the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
ruled that the ``first appearance'' provision of the law had been
ignored in the case of Guadalupe Montalvo-Murillo, charged with
possessing nearly $1 million worth of cocaine.
   Montalvo-Murillo, a citizen of Mexico then legally living in
this country, was stopped last February while driving a pickup
truck near the Mexican border at Orogrande, N.M.
   U.S. Customs Service agents found 72 pounds of cocaine, with a
wholesale value of almost $1 million, in the truck.
   At a Feb. 16 proceeding, a federal magistrate put off a
detention hearing until Feb. 21. After that hearing, the magistrate
decided to release Montalvo-Murillo on $50,000 bail and other
conditions.
   Government prosecutors appealed to a federal judge, who ruled
that Montalvo-Murillo posed both a danger to the community and a
risk to flee.
   But the judge ruled that the New Mexico magistrate, in
postponing the detention hearing for five days, violated the
federal bail law's ``first appearance'' rule. The judge said the
only appropriate remedy was the defendant's release on bail.
   Montalvo-Murillo was freed on $88,500 bail, and has been a
fugitive from justice ever since. He is believed to have fled to
Mexico.
   The 10th Circuit court upheld the judge's ruling that the only
remedy for denying a defendant a timely detention hearing is
release on bail _ even if the result of the hearing would have been
holding the defendant without bail.
   In the appeal acted on today, government lawyers argued that
automatic release for such procedural infractions is not required
by the 1984 law.
   ``The court of appeals erred in imposing a remedy so plainly at
odds with the objectives of the Bail Reform Act,'' the appeal said.
   Lawyers for Montalvo-Murillo urged the court to reject the
government's appeal, contending among other things that their
client's status as a fugitive makes his case moot.
   The case is U.S. vs. Montalvo-Murillo, 89-163.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today rejected an appeal by
an anti-pornography activist who says sexually explicit photographs
and caricatures in Hustler magazine libeled her and invaded her
privacy.
   The court, without comment, refused to revive a $150 million
lawsuit by feminist author Andrea Dworkin.
   A federal judge threw out the suit, and the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals upheld the dimissal last January.
   The Hustler references to Dworkin were opinion, not statements
of fact, and therefore are protected by the free-speech guarantees
in the Constitution's First Amendment, the appeals court said.
   ``Dworkin errs by limiting opinion to high-minded discourse,''
the appeals court said.
   Shielding all opinion from lawsuits ``means that outrageous and
outlandish statements are sometimes protected,'' the appeals court
said. But it added, ``Ludicrous statements are much less insidious
and debilitating than falsities that bear the ring of truth. We
have little doubt that the outrageous and outlandish will be
recognized for what they are.''
   The appeals court also noted that the Supreme Court in 1988
threw out a $200,000 award against Hustler won by television
evangelist Jerry Falwell, who accused the magazine of causing him
emotional distress by publishing a pornographic parody.
   In that decision, the justices gave broad free-speech protection
to parodies and satire.
   Dworkin said she was viciously lampooned by Hustler and its
publisher, Larry Flynt, because of her opposition to pornography.
She is the author of an Indianapolis ordinance, since declared
unconstitutional, that defined pornography as a violation of
women's civil rights and permitted lawsuits against pornographers.
   Dworkin sued over features published in three 1984 issues of
Hustler. One was a cartoon of two women engaged in lesbian sex in
which one woman says to the other, ``You remind me so much of
Andrea Dworkin.''
   A second feature included a series of photographs that referred
to ``the Andrea Dworkin fan club.'' A photograph in a third issue
identified a woman engaged in sex as Dworkin's mother.
   Dworkin sued in Wyoming but the case was transferred to a
federal court in Los Angeles at the request of Hustler.
   The case is Dworkin vs. Hustler, 88-1900.

<HEAD>Court Lets Stand Libel Award Against Rhode Island Newspaper</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today let stand a $278,600
libel award against a Pawtucket, R.I., newspaper.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that news
stories may be libelous even if they contain no false statement.
   Today's action sets no national legal precedent, but instead
leaves unresolved conflicting lower court rulings on the issue.
   The Pawtucket Evening Times, published by a subsidiary of the
Ingersoll Newspapers group, was ordered to pay $28,600 in
compensatory damages and $250,000 in punitive damages to Dr. Paul
Healey, a prominent Pawtucket surgeon who chaired the local YMCA's
board of directors.
   The Rhode Island Supreme Court upheld the jury award last March
3, ruling that an Evening Times article falsely implied that Healey
was asked, and refused, to interrupt a YMCA board meeting to help a
heart attack victim.
   Jerry Lampinski had gone to the board's June 23, 1980 meeting to
criticize the firings of two YMCA staff members but was ordered by
Healey to leave.
   Lampinski then joined a group of protesters about 200 yards from
the room where the board meeting was being held. He collapsed
minutes later.
   Lampinski was given first aid almost immediately, and an
ambulance arrived within 10 minutes. The heart attack, however, was
fatal.
   An Evening Times article two days later reported that
Lampinski's sons were angry over the YMCA board's treatment of
their father.
   The article said the family felt Lampinski ``should have been
given early attention by either a doctor or a paramedic at the
board meeting.''
   The next paragraph said, ``Dr. Paul J. Healey is Y president and
was at the meeting when Lampinski collapsed.''
   The following paragraph noted that Lampinski collapsed 200 yards
from where the board was meeting, and the article went on to quote
a YMCA official refuting any implication that Healey or any other
board member was lax in responding to an emergency.
   The official was quoted as saying that board members, when told
of Lampinski's collapse, also were told that ``the situation was
well in hand and already being taken care of.''
   In its ruling, Rhode Island's highest court said the June 25
article that included the Lampinski family criticism could have
``created the implication that (Healey) was asked and refused to
help Lampinski and that there was enough time for (him) to render
aid.''
   The state court added: ``The evidence could support a finding
that (the newspaper) knew these implications were false or that it
acted in reckless disregard of whether these implications were true
or false ... The defamation here really consists of what was left
unprinted as well as what was actually printed.''
   Using a legal definition employed by other state courts, the
Rhode Island court said publishing an opinion can be libelous ``if
it implies the allegation of undisclosed defamatory facts as the
basis for the opinion.''
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the Evening Times
argued that the legal definition used by the state court violates
free-speech rights.
   ``Only false statements of fact,'' and not the reporting of
someone's stated opinion, can be libelous, they said.
   The newspaper's appeal was supported in a
``friend-of-the-court'' brief sumbitted by five news media
organizations _ the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press,
the National Association of Broadcasters, the Newsletter
Association, the Radio-Television News Directors Association and
the Society of Professional Journalists.
   They said the Evening Times had been punished ``for attempting
to fairly and neutrally report both sides of a controversial local
matter.''
   The case is New England Newspapers Inc. vs. Healey, 88-1939.

<HEAD>Texas Anti-Abortion Protesters Lose Appeal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three people convicted of trespassing for
handing out anti-abortion booklets to students outside a Texas high
school lost a Supreme Court appeal today.
   The court, without comment, let stand rulings that distribution
of the ``pro-life'' literature on school grounds was not protected
by the Constitution's free-speech guarantees.
   John Harris, Patricia Murphy and Charles Reed were arrested
outside Friendswood High School in Galveston County on Jan. 22,
1987, after refusing to leave.
   A state jury convicted them of criminal trespass, and a judge
sentenced each to 90 days probation and 40 hours of community
service.
   The high school, where more than 1,000 students attend classes,
is fronted by a public road that has no adjacent sidewalk. There is
no access to students from the roadside because most arrive by car
or bus, and are dropped off on school grounds.
   In the appeal acted on today, the three convicted trespassers
contended that their peaceful action before the start of classes
should be constitutionally protected.
   ``The vehicle unloading area and adjacent grounds in front of
the school ... should be considered a limited public forum'' where
distribution of literature is allowed, the appeal argued.
   Under past free-speech rulings, a limited public forum is an
area opened for use by certain speakers or on certain occasions.
   But a Texas appeals court ruled that the Friendswood High
grounds are not any kind of public forum, and the handing out of
booklets there is not constitutionally protected. The appeals court
upheld the convictions.
   ``The place is not an area which by tradition has been devoted
to public assembly or debate by the general public ... there is no
evidence that it had ever been opened by the school authorities as
a place for public expressive activity,'' the state court said.
   It added: ``A limited public forum cannot be created ... simply
because members of the public are permitted to come and go at
will.''
   The case is Harris vs. Texas, 88-2077.

<HEAD>Court Will Hear Pennsylvania Victims' Rights Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court said today it will consider
placing new limits on the ability of convicted criminals to avoid
making restitution to their victims by declaring bankruptcy.
   The court agreed to hear an appeal by Pennsylvania officials
seeking to recover $4,145 from a couple who pleaded guilty to
welfare fraud.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against Pennsylvania
welfare officials last March in the case of Edward and Debora
Davenport of Bucks County.
   The Davenports pleaded guilty in 1985 to welfare fraud. Each was
sentenced to one year probation and ordered to make monthly
restitution payments of $208 until $4,145 was collected.
   The Davenports sought protection in 1987 under Chapter 13 of the
federal bankruptcy code.
   As amended by Congress in 1978, Chapter 13 is designed to give
debtors various court-supervised options to repay part of what they
owe and eventually be rid of their debts.
   A federal bankruptcy judge ruled in 1988 that the couple
fulfilled its Chapter 13 obligations without making the restitution
payments to the state.
   The 3rd Circuit court upheld the judge's decision. The appeals
court said excusing the Davenports from the restitution payments is
in line with the 1978 amendments Congress made to the bankruptcy
code.
   Otherwise, the appeals court said, ``restitution conceivably
could deplete all the debtor's resources before any distribution is
made to the other creditors.''
   The appeals court ruling seems to conflict with a 1986 Supreme
Court ruling that barred criminals from using another part of the
bankruptcy code, Chapter 7, to avoid restitution.
   Unlike the Chapter 13 provisions, people who declare bankruptcy
under Chapter 7 must liquidate their assets. The proceeds then are
divided among creditors.
   The appeals court said the 1986 Supreme Court ruling is limited
to Chapter 7.
   The appeals court said Chapter 7, unlike Chapter 13, specifies
that ``a fine, penalty or forfeiture payable to and for the benefit
of a governmental unit'' is not considered a debt for purposes of
bankruptcy.
   If Chapter 13 improperly creates ``a haven for criminals,'' it
is up to Congress, not the courts, to correct the problem, the
appeals court said.
   ``Where Congress has enacted legislation which arguably affects
state criminal proceedings, it is not the function of this court to
cure any perceived defects in that legislation,'' the appeals court
said.
   In the appeal acted on today, Pennsylvania officials noted that
restitution payments are an option to be considered by sentencing
judges in all states, and are required in many states.
   The case is Pennsylvania vs. Davenport, 89-156.

<HEAD>High Court Lets States File Charges for Safety and Health Neglect</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today let stand a ruling
that allows states to file criminal charges against employers
accused of neglecting the health and safety of workers.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling in an Illinois
case that federal workplace regulations do not bar such state
prosecutions.
   Five officials of Chicago Magnet Wire Corp. are awaiting trial
on charges they recklessly injured 42 workers by exposing them to
toxic chemicals, extreme heat and other unsafe conditions at a
wire-coating plant.
   Prosecutors said conditions at the plant were extremely
hazardous, and accused the officials of callously disregarding
worker safety.
   Prosecutors said air in the plant was filled with smoke and
chemical fumes, temperatures reached 300 degrees on catwalks and
employees were not allowed to wear masks.
   The state said workers often passed out from the heat and fumes,
and on at least one occasion the plant manager laughed at an
employee who suffered enamel burns.
   Chicago Magnet Wire officials argued that the criminal charges
should be thrown out because the federal government pre-empted
state prosecutions when it enacted the Occupational Safety and
Health Act of 1970.
   The officials said permitting such prosecutions would allow
``wholly uninformed and, most likely, wholly unconcerned'' local
prosecutors and juries to decide when a factory is unsafe. They
said the job should be left to ``experienced and knowledgeable
federal officials setting uniform national workplace safety
standards.''
   Their appeal was supported by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and
other business groups that said allowing criminal prosecutions will
cause ``regulatory chaos.''
   In refusing to squelch the prosecution, the Illinois Supreme
Court last February said, ``State criminal law can provide a
valuable and forceful supplement to insure that workers are
adequately protected and that particular egregious conduct receives
appropriate punishment.''
   The Chicago Magnet Wire officials indicted were Anthony Jordan,
president; Kevin Keane, plant manager; Frank Asta, maintenance
foreman; Allan Simon, plant engineer; and Gerald Colby, an
engineering and maintenance supervisor.
   If convicted, they face maximum sentences of 10 to 20 years in
prison.
   The case is Asta vs. Illinois, 88-1783.

   Hundreds of people cheered and threw
rice as 11 homosexual couples got married on the day a new law
allowing such unions went into effect.
   The couples got married during a ceremony Sunday at the Town
Hall. Hundreds of supporters waved flags and threw rice, while a
group of Christian fundamentalists demonstrated nearby.
   Denmark became the first country to give homosexual couples
legal status when Parliament approved a gay rights bill in May by a
lopsided majority. Only the small People's Christian party voted
against the bill.
   The law, which went into effect Sunday, gives homosexual couples
nearly equal rights as heterosexual couples, but bars them from the
right to adopt children. Homosexuals now have the same inheritance
rights, tax advantages and the right to share a last name.
   According to the new law, at least one of the partners must have
Danish citizenship and live in Denmark.

<HEAD>Court to Decide Farm Worker Issue in Florida Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether farm workers who suffer transportation-related injuries may
sue their employers after receiving worker-compensation benefits.
   The justices said they will review a ruling in the case of 10
Florida farm hands that such lawsuits are allowed under a federal
law, the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Workers Protection Act.
   The 10 workers were hurt in 1985 while being transported in a
van by their employer, the Adams Fruit Co. Each collected
worker-compensation benefits from Adams under Florida law.
   They then sued their employer in federal court, alleging that
Adams violated the federal law by transporting them in an unsafe
van.
   Lawyers for Adams sought to have the suit dismissed, contending
that the state's worker-compensation law made it the exclusive
legal remedy for such injuries.
   U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Kovachevich in Tampa ruled for
Adams, concluding that the federal law's motor vehicle safety
provisions could not be invoked by workers who had collected
worker-compensation benefits.
   But her ruling was overturned by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals last March 15.
   ``Both the goal of preventing unsafe transportation practices
and the role of private suits in enforcing worker protections
convince us that applying (the Florida worker compensation law) to
bar private suits for violations of the (federal) act when
transportation is covered by worker-compensation insurance would
frustrate congressional intent,'' the appeals court said.
   It added: ``The receipt of worker-compensation benefits does not
bar a private suit for actual or statutory damages based on
violations of the act. The amount of worker-compensation benefits,
however, may be considered in awarding actual damages.''
   Lawyers for Adams said the 11th Circuit court's ruling conflicts
with a decision by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in a case
from South Carolina.
   In it, the 4th Circuit court ruled that a farm worker injured
when sprayed by pesticides could not sue under the federal law
after receiving worker-compensation benefits.
   Because of the conflicting rulings, the appeal said, ``it is now
impossible for farmers across the nation to know to what extent
they must protect themselves from ... additional losses.''
   The case is Adams Fruit Co. vs. Barrett, 88-2035.

<HEAD>Court Says States May Require Auto Insurance Despite Religious Convictions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today let states require
automobile insurance for motorists who say it violates their
religious convictions.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by a South Dakota
man who believes having insurance belittles a promise from God to
provide in any situation.
   Lindy Cosgrove of Reliance, S.D., was stopped by a state trooper
in January 1988 while driving on a road closed because of a
blizzard.
   When he did not produce proof he had car insurance, Cosgrove was
charged with violating a state law requiring motorists to
``maintain financial responsibility'' for motor vehicles.
   The law requires either liability insurance or the posting of a
$75,000 bond or $50,000 certificate of deposit to protect others
who might be injured by a motorist.
   Cosgrove pleaded not guilty, saying that since 1972 he has
refused, because of his religious beliefs, all forms of insurance.
   As evidence of his sincerity, Cosgrove said he and his wife
refused free insurance from their employers.
   Cosgrove was fined $75, and his license could be revoked under
the state law.
   The South Dakota Supreme Court ruled in May that while
Cosgrove's religious beliefs apparently are sincere, the state has
a legitimate interest in requiring car insurance.
   The law ``is clearly designed to protect the public,'' the state
court said. Without the law, damages caused by car accidents
``could be borne by the public at large rather than those who are
responsible,'' the state court said.
   It added that the options of a bond or certificate of deposit
permit Cosgrove to maintain financial responsibility for his
driving without purchasing insurance.
   But Cosgrove said the bond or the certificate would be a
tremendous economic burden for him.
   The alternatives ``place an unmistakable burden on Cosgrove's
free exercise of his religious beliefs,'' his lawyers said.
   They also argued that the state's interest in requiring
insurance is less than compelling because many motorists _ tourists
from out of state, for example _ are permitted to drive without
insurance.
   The Supreme Court in 1985, by a 4-4 vote, barred Nebraska
officials from requiring a driver's license photograph for a woman
who believes the Bible forbids such a ``graven image.'' But that
tie vote, while upholding a lower court ruling in favor of the
woman, established no national precedent.
   In other cases, the high court has ruled for individuals whose
observance of the Sabbath conflicted with state authority.
   Last March, the justices unanimously barred states from denying
unemployment benefits to people who refuse to work on their Sabbath
even if the refusal is based on individual religious belief rather
than a religious group's doctrine.
   The case acted on today is Cosgrove vs. South Dakota, 89-10.

   The Supreme Court today let stand a $1.2
million bonus in fees awarded to the lawyers for consumers who sued
over allegedly defective transmissions in some General Motors cars.
   The justices, without comment, turned away arguments that
federal law does not allow such fee bonuses when lawyers win cases
in which there was a substantial risk of non-payment because of a
loss.
   Various lawsuits against GM, each alleging that less efficient
engines and transmissions were substituted in certain lines of
cars, were consolidated into one ``class action'' case in 1982.
   The case was settled in 1985 after GM agreed to establish a $17
million fund to be shared by those who sued.
   A federal judge awarded the consumers' lawyers nearly $2 million
in fees, to be paid out of the fund. The award was based on time
expended and reasonable hourly rates.
   The judge refused to enhance the fee award as a bonus for taking
a risky case on a contingency fee basis, ruling that the federal
Magnuson-Moss Act bars any such ``risk multiplier'' of a lawyer's
fees.
   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the award ruling
last year and ordered the judge to apply a risk multiplier in the
GM case.
   The judge then awarded an additional $1.2 million in lawyer fees.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for GM argued that the
appeals court ruling conflicts with language in the Magnuson-Moss
Act and with a 1987 Supreme Court decision limiting lawyer-fee
bonuses.
   The 7th Circuit court rejected a narrow reading of the federal
law's language. The appeals court said the 1987 ruling did not
apply to the GM case because a settlement had resulted in a common
fund for payments to consumers and their lawyers.
   GM lawyers called the appeals court ruling a ``patent evasion''
of the 1987 high court ruling. They said the appeals court decision
``will increase the incentive for plaintiffs' attorneys to clog the
courts with marginal lawsuits in the hope of recovering large
multipliers, while spawning complex litigation over the collateral
issue of attorneys' fees.''
   GM's appeal was supported in a ``friend-of-the-court'' brief
submitted by the National Association of Counties, the National
Governors' Association, the National League of Cities and the U.S.
Conference of Mayors.
   The brief noted that state and local governments ``are among the
defendants most frequently sued under federal statutes providing
for awards of attorney fees.''
   The case is GM vs. Skelton, 88-1848.

<TEXT>
   Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi is calling
on the Bush administration to take a more active diplomatic role to
head off the possible collapse of peace talks designed to end the
14-year old civil war in his homeland.
   Savimbi said Sunday he will carry that message to President
Bush, other senior administration officials and congressional
leaders this week. He said a stronger U.S. role is appropriate in
light of the long history of U.S. diplomatic activity in the area.
   ``The United States knows the players,'' said Savimbi, head of
the UNITA rebel group.
   Bush will meet with Savimbi on Thursday ``to discuss current
developments in southern Africa, including the national
reconciliation process in Angola and the proposals to end the
fighting in that country,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said today.
   Angola seemed on the verge of a peace settlement in June when
representatives of the leftist government and of Savimbi's
U.S.-backed rebel movement reached agreement on a cease-fire and on
negotiations intended to lead to national reconciliation.
   But the truce broke down in August, with each side blaming the
other, and the situation has been aggravated during Zaire-mediated
talks by profound differences over what constitutes national
reconciliation.
   Savimbi, speaking with two American reporters on Sunday,
reaffirmed his view that a settlement can come about only through
the creation of a national unity government whose main task would
be to arrange for free and fair elections.
   The government of Angola, meanwhile, has said reconciliation
should consist mainly of the rebels' integration into the existing
political and military establishment.
   Savimbi also said he was prepared to meet with a high-level
Angolan Foreign Ministry delegation, which is due to arrive here on
Wednesday.
   However, in the talks mediated by Zaire, the two sides have
refused to negotiate in the same room. Adding to Savimbi's
frustration is the perception among some that Zaire President
Mobutu Sese Seko has embraced the Angolan government's view of the
requirements for peace.
   On Sunday, however, Savimbi declined to criticize Mobutu,
concentrating his fire instead on the Angolan government.
   The Soviet Union has been Angola's chief supplier of military
equipment. Cuba has had troops in Angola since 1975 but in December
agreed to withdraw them by 1991 as part of a U.S.-mediated
settlement. The United States has been providing military and other
assistance to UNITA since 1986.
   Savimbi said election processes are being used to bring about
change in countries as diverse as Poland and Namibia, where South
African colonial rule is ending, and he said elections are the only
guarantee of peace in Angola.
   ``The power has to come from the people,'' he said, adding that
he is confident the majority of Angolans are on UNITA's side.

<HEAD>High Court Lets Pennsylvania Require Judges to Retire at Age 70</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today allowed Pennsylvania
to require its state judges to retire at age 70.
   The court, without comment, turned away arguments that such a
mandatory retirement age for judges is unconstitutional.
   The controversy may have had special poignancy at the nation's
highest court, where four of the nine justices are over 70 and a
fifth will turn 70 next year.
   Justices William J. Brennan, Justice Thurgood and Harry A.
Blackmun are over 80. Justice Byron R. White is 72, and Justice
John Paul Stevens will turn 70 on April 20. Each has life tenure,
as do all federal judges.
   Since 1968, the Pennsylvania Constitution has required all state
judges _ who generally are elected to 10-year terms _ to step down
at 70.
   Four judges challenged the state constitutional provision,
saying it conflicts with the equal-protection and due-process
guarantees offered in the federal Constitution.
   But the state Supreme Court last March 1 upheld the mandatory
retirement scheme as a rational way to promote legitimate state
purposes.
   The state court identified those purposes as:
   _Continually bringing in younger judges while retaining
part-time services of retired judges willing and able to help out.
   _Eliminating unpleasantness of removing aged and disabled judges
on an individual selective basis.
   _Preventing harm caused by senile judges.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the four state judges
attacked each stated purpose.
   ``Removing older judges to make room for younger ones is unfair,
legally unsupportable and unwise,'' the appeal argued. ``The public
interest is not served by forcing mature, experienced judges off
the bench before their elected terms expire.''
   It added that because chronological age ``bears no scientific
relationship to mental competence,'' a blanket policy on retirement
``denies judges their rights to individualized determinations of
their fitness for service.''
   Removing the unpleasantness that may accompany such individual
determinations ``has never been considered a legitimate excuse for
rank discrimination,'' the appeal said.
   The mandatory retirement is not an effective way of protecting
the public from senile judges, the appeal said, because mental
incompetence may set in far earlier than someone's 70th birthday.
   The justices in 1976 upheld a Massachusetts law requiring
mandatory retirement of state police officers at age 50, and in
1979 upheld a federal law requiring mandatory retirement of foreign
service officers at age 60.
   The four state judges who appealed the Pennsylvania mandatory
retirement are Leon Katz, Robert Wright, John Rauhauser Jr. and
William Pfadt.
   The case is Katz vs. Pennsylvania, 89-80.

<HEAD>Antiwar Activists Accused of Breaking into Pennsylvania Plant Lose
Appeal</HEAD>

   Eight antiwar activists convicted of breaking
into a Pennsylvania plant, damaging two nuclear missile cones and
pouring blood on related documents lost a Supreme Court appeal
today.
   The court, over two dissenting votes, turned down arguments that
the activists, known as the ``Plowshares Eight'' after the biblical
prophesy that swords will be beaten into plowshares, were denied a
fair trial.
   Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall voted to grant
full review to the case, but that left the eight activists two
votes short.
   The eight, including longtime antiwar activist brothers Daniel
and Philip Berrigan, broke into a General Electric plant in King of
Prussia, Pa., on Sept. 9, 1980.
   The protesters used hammers to beat the missile cones GE was
manufacturing for the federal government. Prosecutors said the
intruders caused about $28,000 in damages.
   In addition to the Berrigans, the defendants were the Rev. Carl
Kabat of Baltimore, a priest with the Oblate of Mary Immaculate
Order; Sister Anne Montgomery, a member of the Relgious Order of
the Sacred Heart who taught in New York City; Dean Hammer, a New
Haven, Conn., Protestant chaplain; Elmer Maas, a former music and
philosophy professor; Molly Rush of Pittsburgh, director of the
Thomas Merton Center for Justice and Peace; and John Schuchardt, a
Baltimore lawyer.
   Each was convicted of burglary, conspiracy and criminal mischief
in a 1981 trial in Norristown, Pa. Sentences ranged up to
3-to-10-year prison terms.
   A state appeals court threw out the convictions after ruling
that the eight had been denied a public trial because only news
reporters, not members of the general public, were allowed to be in
the courtroom during jury selection.
   The Pennsylvania Supreme Court reversed that ruling and sent the
case back to the appeals court.
   In late 1987, the appeal court ruled that the trial judge had
been biased against the defendants, and ordered resentencing. But
it voted 5-4 to uphold the eight convictions.
   The state Supreme Court refused to hear the activists' ensuing
appeal last Feb. 3.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the eight argued that
the defendants' right to a fair and public trial was violated by
the exclusion of most spectators during the five days in which
jurors were selected.
   ``Exemption of the press from an order closing the courtoom for
the first five days of the trial cannot relieve the judge's action
of its constitutional defect,'' the appeal said.
   In urging the justices to reject the appeal, Montgomery County
lawyer Mary M. Killinger said, ``There was no real limitation on
the public's access to any information,'' and that the exclusion
was ordered to ensure ``a calm and quiet setting.''
   Saying that the judge's exclusion order was ``perhaps unwise,''
Ms. Killinger said it ``does not catapult this case into the area
of significant and constitutional error'' worthy of the high
court's review.
   The eight activists have not yet been resentenced. All except
Kabat, who is serving a prison term for an unrelated conviction,
are free on bail.
   The case is Berrigan vs. Pennsylvania, 89-5119.

<HEAD>Court Rejects Appeal in Lipton Merger Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today turned its back on a
still-brewing tempest over America's multi-million dollar herbal
tea market.
   The justices, without comment, refused to take up an antitrust
controversy stemming from the once-planned acquisition by Thomas J.
Lipton Inc. of Kraft's Celestial Seasonings Inc.
   The case dates back to 1987, when Lipton, a subsidiary of the
huge grocery products distributor Unilever, announced it had agreed
to buy Celestial Seasonings from Kraft Inc.
   Celestial is the largest U.S. producer of herbal teas,
accounting for 52 percent of all sales.
   Lipton controls the second largest herbal tea market share, 32
percent.
   Herbal teas are not actually teas but blends of flowers, leaves,
roots and stems of edible plants. The blends are steeped in water,
yielding a natural, caffeine-free beverage.
   After it became clear the Federal Trade Commission was not going
to challenge the purchase, competitor R.C. Bigelow Inc. sued in
federal court to stop it.
   Bigelow, a family-owned business based in Norwalk, Conn.,
accounts for about 13 percent of the herbal tea market's sales.
   Its lawsuit contended that the merger of Lipton and Celestial
would create a monopoly that would hurt Bigelow's chances of
competing effectively in selling herbal teas.
   U.S. District Judge Jose Cabranes in New Haven, Conn., threw out
the suit, ruling that Bigelow had not proved the merger would
result in predatory pricing or any other antitrust law violation.
   ``The mere fact that Lipton will possess monopoly power after
the proposed acquisition is not a sufficient showing that Lipton
will exercise that power in a way that will cause injury to
Bigelow,'' the judge said.
   His ruling relied heavily on a 1986 Supreme Court decision that
made it more difficult for companies to challenge successfully
mergers of their competitors.
   In that decision, the justices said a business making such a
challenge ``must show a threat of antitrust injury'' and that ``a
showing of loss or damage due merely to increased competition does
not constitute such injury.''
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last Jan. 17 reinstated
the suit.
   It said the fact that Lipton would have an 84 percent share of
the herbal tea market after purchasing Celestial ``constitutes
sufficient evidence, in and of itself, of antitrust injury to a
competitor to create a genuine issue for trial.''
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for Lipton and Kraft said
the 2nd Circuit court's ruling conflicts with the 1986 Supreme
Court decision.
   What practical impact the case, sent back to Judge Cabranes by
the appeals court, continues to pack for the herbal tea market is
being debated.
   Kraft in September 1988 cancelled the proposed sale and entered
into an agreement with Vestar Capital Partners Inc., a firm
specializing in leveraged buyouts, for a management-led buyout of
Celestial.
   Bigelow argued before the 2nd Circuit court that the September
sale did not make the case moot because the Lipton-Celestial
transaction has not been irrevocably abandoned.
   Bigelow ``takes the position that there is more than a mere or
abstract possibility that Lipton will again seek to acquire
Celestial,'' the appeals court said. ``We agree.''
   The case is Lipton vs. Bigelow, 88-1948.

   Tornadoes and flooding targeted the hurricane-hammered South
today after storms destroyed a trailer park, killing a woman and
toddler, and chased scores of people from their homes in Georgia
and the Carolinas.
   A twister tore through Lebanon, S.C., early today, tossing a
house trailer that stood through the hurricane onto a road and
injuring its two occupants. Neither was hurt seriously, said Doris
Browder, a dispatcher at the Berkeley County Emergency Medical
Service.
   Rain continued to pour throughout the region today, falling on
ground already soaked by rain that came with Hurricane Hugo on the
night of Sept. 21 and pushing rivers and streams toward flood
levels.
   Three people were missing after high water washed out a bridge
and swept a car into a branch of Richardson Creek early today in
North Carolina's Union County, southeast of Charlotte. A
17-year-old woman rescued after she was found clinging to branches
said three other people were in the car, but no one else was found.
   Joe Manous, who grows sod next to the Etowah River in Canton,
Ga., north of Atlanta, said a flash flood Sunday afternoon sent
water 6 feet deep over his field, engulfing two tractors and a
brand new one-ton truck.
   ``We didn't have time to get the tractors out, and it's already
up to the windshield on the truck,'' he said. ``It looks like it's
been rising a couple of inches every 15 minutes.''
   A tornado touched down in a mobile home park near Moultrie, Ga.,
on Sunday, killing trailer park residents Joyce Carter, 45, and
2-year-old Brittany Thomas, injuring 12 and destroying a church and
social hall.
   At least nine mobile homes were destroyed by the tornado, which
cut a 10-mile path through the south Georgia countryside, said
Colquitt County Sheriff Billy Howell.
   After demolishing the mobile home park, the twister tore up a
stand of timber and then flattened the Bethlehem Schley Baptist
Church and the church's social hall.
   Strong winds that may have been a tornado chased residents from
their homes Sunday night in Fairview and Swan Lake southeast of
Atlanta, authorities said. A count of the evacuaees was unavailable.
   About 80 families were evacuated from homes around Mountain
Island Lake near Charlotte, N.C., by rising waters Sunday night.
Water washed into yards and into some homes, authorities said.
   To the east, 80 people fled a mobile home park near McAdenville,
N.C., as Crowders Creek overflowed its banks.
   ``The water just kept rising,'' said Angela Haney as she left
with her husband and three young daughters.
   In Anderson County, S.C., flooding forced the temporary
evacuation of about 100 people, said Sheriff's Lt. Rufus
Clinkscales.
   More than 13 inches of rain has fallen on the Atlanta area the
past week, with weekend downpours flooding creeks and rivers,
closing numerous roads.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today rejected an appeal by
older U.S. Postal Service inspectors who say they are being forced
illegally to transfer to other cities.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the
inspectors are not victims of illegal age discrimination.
   The Postal Service, which employs more than 1,900 inspectors,
has faced a problem of chronic staff shortages in 14 major
metropolitan areas.
   The service in 1980 adopted what it calls its career path policy
to ease the big-city shortages.
   Inspectors are urged to volunteer for work in the big cities. As
an incentive, inspectors who have spent two years in one of the big
cities are exempt from similar transfers later on when they reach
senior-level status.
   Also, anyone who has served five years in one of the 14
metropolitan areas is eligible to be asked for reassignment.
   Another provision of the career path policy puts senior-level
inspectors who have not worked in the big cities at the top of the
list for involuntary transfers.
   It is that so-called senior-first rule that was challenged by
the older inspectors. They said the policy disproportionately harms
inspectors over age 40.
   A federal judge ruled that the provision violates the federal
Age Discrimination in Employment Act, which is aimed at protecting
older workers against arbitrary bias.
   The judge's ruling was overturned in December 1988 by the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals here.
   The appeals court said the senior-first rule should not be
examined in isolation.
   ``The senior-first rule was not a free-standing element of an
employment program,'' the appeals court said. ``Under the career
path policy, every (senior-level) employee was expected to spend
five years in a major metropolitan area. Thus, each (senior-level)
employee can fulfill this uniform service requirement through
either an early voluntary, or a later involuntary, transfer.''
   The appeals court said the Postal Service properly refused to
adopt an alternative system of random transfers because that would
have reduced the incentive for voluntary moves to big cities.
   In the appeal acted on today, the senior inspectors said they
have been hit with significant hardship by the transfer rule.
   After living for years in the same location, they said the
system forced them to uproot their families and move to areas with
a higher cost of living.
   Regardless of the Postal Service's motives, the senior
inspectors said the senior-first rule is illegal because it has a
disproportionate impact on older workers.
   Bush administration lawyers urged the justices to reject the
appeal, saying, the system ``ensures that the burdens of employment
are distributed fairly while giving postal inspectors as much
control as possible over their careers.''
   The case is Arnold vs. Postmaster General, 89-8.

<HEAD>President of Nauru in South Pacific Loses Bid to Revive Libel Suit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The president of the tiny South Pacific
republic of Nauru today lost a Supreme Court appeal aimed at
reviving his libel lawsuit against a Guam newspaper.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that President
Hammer DeRoburt was not libeled by the Pacific Daily News.
   The newspaper, owned by Gannett Inc., reported in 1978 that
DeRoburt secretly made an illegal $600,000 loan to a Marshall
Islands political faction that favored separating the islands from
Micronesia.
   DeRoburt said the article and a related one were false. He said
the loan was legal, was a matter of public record and was made
before DeRoburt was elected president.
   Nauru is an indepedent island nation of about eight square miles
with some 4,000 residents. It is among the wealthiest nations per
capita because of vast phosphate deposits.
   After years of legal maneuvering, a federal jury in Hawaii
decided in favor of the newspaper in 1985. The jury found that
DeRoburt failed to prove actual malice _ that the newspaper
knowingly printed falsehoods or acted with reckless disregard for
the truth.
   A key issue in the case was the identity of two confidential
sources relied on by the newspaper.
   DeRoburt at one point alleged that the sources did not exist.
His lawyers wanted the jury told it could presume there were no
sources.
   But during trial, the reporter who wrote the first article named
two sources, including one who by that time had died.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the jury verdict in
October 1988. The appeals court said DeRoburt's lawyers, in effect,
abandoned their claim that no sources existed.
   They ``chose to present (DeRoburt's) case in a manner
inconsistent with a theory of no sources,'' the appeals court said.
For the judge ``to then instruct the jury that it should
conclusively presume that there were no sources would have been
contrary to the evidence presented at trial by both parties and
contrary to the truth,'' the appeals court said.
   In the appeal acted on today, DeRoburt urged the justices to
overturn their 1964 ruling that established the ``actual malice''
defense in libel suits filed by public officials.
   In the alternative, DeRoburt's lawyers said the burden of
proving there was no actual malice should be shifted to the
newspaper when it has withheld, concealed or destroyed relevant
evidence.
   DeRoburt alleged that the reporter who wrote the first 1978
article destroyed his notes.
   The case is DeRoburt vs. Gannett, 89-9.

   An evangelical Christian group ordered to
return most of the $6.5 million donated by a wealthy ex-member lost
a Supreme Court appeal today.
   The court, without comment, let stand rulings that the group,
The Bible Speaks, received the donations after exerting undue
influence on department store heiress Elizabeth Dayton Dovydenas.
   The group now must return $5.5 million.
   At issue was whether allowing Mrs. Dovydenas to rescind her
gifts, made over a 12-month period ending in late 1985, violates
the The Bible Speaks' religious freedom.
   The Bible Speaks was based in Lenox, Mass., and was led by
founder Carl Stevens.
   The Bible Speaks claimed 1,200 members worldwide until it
disbanded in the summer of 1987. Stevens has since moved to the
Baltimore area, where the church has been revived under the name
The Greater Grace.
   The Bible Speaks appeal was supported in ``friend-of-the-court''
briefs submitted by the National Council of Churches, comprised of
32 national Protestant and Eastern Orthodox churches, and by
television evangelist Jerry Falwell's Old-Time Gospel Hour.
   Lawyers for the National Council of Churches said Mrs.
Dovydenas' legal victory ``is not just ominous for religious
liberty, but devastating.''
   Lawyers for the Old-Time Gospel Hour said Falwell's related
ministries received more than $100 million in gifts in the fiscal
year that ended June 31 and in recent fiscal years had received at
least one gift of over $1 million.
   ``No surer way to destroy the churches of America could be
found,'' they said, ``than to permit the courts to strip them of
gifts ... by allowing a wealthy, disaffected donor to reclaim a
gift.''
   Mrs. Dovydenas, an heir to the Dayton-Hudson fortune, grew up in
Minnesota. Some years ago, after moving to Lenox in 1981 with her
husband, she assessed her personal wealth at about $19 million.
Mrs. Dovydenas joined The Bible Speaks in 1982.
   Within a three-year period, Mrs. Dovydenas gave The Bible Speaks
over $6.5 million _ including major donations of $5 million, $1
million and $500,000.
   Mrs. Dovydenas' family, after inviting her to her father's
birthday party in Minnesota in late 1985, hired two
``deprogrammers'' to talk to her. She later left The Bible Speaks,
and sued to have her gifts returned.
   A federal trial judge ordered the religious group to return $6.5
million, but the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that only
$5.5 million must be returned.
   The appeal acted on today challenged only that portion of the
appeals court decision concerning the $5 million gift.
   Lawyers for The Bible Speaks said the lower court rulings
threaten all religious groups. ``But they are of especially grave
concern to evangelical and fundamentalist religious communities,''
the appeal said.
   ``Their non-mainstream character renders them particularly
vulnerable to bias and misunderstanding, both conscious and
unconscious, in tort and restitution suits brought by apostate
members, particularly former members who have undergone extensive
professional deprogramming,'' the appeal said.
   The case is The Bible Speaks vs. Dovydenas, 88-1977.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Disturb Virginia's Ban on Funeral Phone Solicitation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to disturb a
state's ban on telephone solicitation for pre-arranged funerals.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments by an insurance
firm and two funeral directors that such a Virginia law violates
their free-speech rights.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last March upheld a 1951
Virginia law banning the telephoning of potential customers to line
up funeral business.
   The appeals court said the Constitution permits such
restrictions on commercial speech.
   The law was challenged by Guardian Plans Inc., an
insurance-funded funeral program, and two funeral homes that
participate in the plan.
   Guardian sells pre-arranged, or ``pre-need'' funerals by
including in the company's life insurance policies benefits to pay
for funerals. When a policyholder dies, the family must agree to
release the policy proceeds to a funeral home.
   Guardian said the plan is intended to be humane and a help to
customers, sparing family members the anguish of deciding how much
to pay for a funeral at the time of a loved one's death.
   But the Virginia Board of Funeral Directors and Embalmers,
saying it was trying to protect consumers, complained about the
soliciting of business over the phone.
   Guardian and its participating funeral homes said the state
board is influenced by the funeral industry, and that the ban on
phone solicitations is a ploy to reduce competition.
   The 4th Circuit court said, ``The Virginia statute leaves open
ample alternatives for (Guardian and its plan participants) to
advertise their services. Consequently, Virginia's ban on
telemarketing does not violate the First Amendment.''
   Guardian's appeal was supported by the American Cemetery
Association, which represents 2,000 funeral homes nationwide.
   The association's lawyers cited a statement by Federal Trade
Commission officials that restricting such telephone solicitations
is anti-competitive.
   The case is Guardian Plans vs. Teague, 89-38.

<HEAD>Court Won't Hear Alaska's Appeal to Stop Offshore Oil and Gas Exploration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alaska's attempt to forestall offshore oil and
gas exploration in its Bristol Bay suffered a Supreme Court setback
today.
   The court, over one dissenting vote, left intact rulings that
allowed the federal government last year to sell leases on 5.6
million acres of Bristol Bay, off Alaska's southwestern coast.
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun voted to hear arguments in the case
but four votes are needed to grant such review.
   The court turned away warnings by Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper and
others that an oil spill in Bristol Bay could do more environmental
harm than the massive Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska's Prince William
Sound last March.
   The disputed leases were sold for nearly $100 million after a
federal judge and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected a
challenge by Cowper and numerous enviromental groups, fishing
associations and Alaska communities.
   The federal government first began considering oil and gas
leasing in the North Aleutian Basin, which underlies Bristol Bay,
in 1974.
   After twice canceling plans for lease sales in the bay at
Alaska's request, the secretary of Interior in 1982 proposed
leasing all 32.5 million acres, beginning in 1985.
   The secretary, in response to concerns expressed by Alaska
officials, later restricted the leasing to the southwest corner of
the region by deleting nearly 83 percent of the acreage from the
sale.
   Under the federal Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, the
Department of Interior must give the governor of any affected state
a chance to make recommendations about any proposed lease sale.
   The governor recommended that the federal government delay
selling any Bristol Bay leases for eight years, and then not sell
any tracts within 25 miles of shore. The Interior secretary
rejected both recommendations, sparking the lawsuit.
   The appeal acted on today contended that the Interior secretary
violated the continental shelf law because his rejection of the
state's recommendations was ``arbitrary and capricious.''
   In the appeal, Alaska Attorney General Douglas Baily referred to
last March's oil spill by the grounded tanker Exxon Valdez as a
dramatic example of ``the devastating impact of oil on biological
resources.''
   ``Bristol Bay and the North Aleutian Basin are substantially
more remote and inaccessible than (Prince William Sound), the
weather is much more problematic ... efforts to clean up an oil
spill in this area accordingly would be even less successful than
in the sound,'' the appeal said.
   It accused the federal government of not striking ``a proper
balance ... between satisfying the nation's thirst for oil and gas
and protecting one of the most biologically productive and
important areas in the world.''
   The appeal was supported by the attorneys general of California,
Florida, Massachusetts, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oregon, Texas
and Washington and by the South Carolina Coastal Council.
   The Bush administration urged the justices to reject the appeal.
   Justice Department lawyers said federal law gives the Interior
secretary _ not a governor _ the authority to make a final decision
on lease sales.
   The case is Cowper vs. Secretary of Interior, 88-2000.

<HEAD>Court Rejects San Francisco Policemen's Appeal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to hear an
appeal by San Francisco policemen who say they lost out on
promotions due to unfair preferences given to women and minorities.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the
officers, mostly white men, are not the victims of reverse bias who
are entitled to promotions.
   The case stems from a 1973 lawsuit in behalf of women and racial
minorities who said the city's police department discriminated
against them.
   That suit was settled in 1979, when the city agreed to hire and
promote more women and minorities within the police department, and
to use unbiased promotion tests.
   The city in 1983 gave a test for promotion to sergeant and
inspector that included multiple-choice questions, essays and an
oral exam.
   But when the scores of women and minorities scored
disproportionately lower than white males, city officials changed
the test results. More weight was given to the oral exam so that
more women and minorities would be promoted.
   The San Francisco Police Officers Association and officers whose
scores were downgraded sued.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in March that
revising the test scores was illegal discrimination, but it refused
to order promotions for any officers whose test scores were lowered
as a result.
   The appeals court said the test as originally scored violated
the 1979 court order since the exam adversely affected minorities
and women.
   ``The persons who did well on it did not acquire any rights,''
the appeals court said. It added that those people who benefitted
when the scores were changed may not be penalized by having to give
up promotions in favor of those with higher original scores.
   Instead, the appeals court ordered the city not to change test
scores in this manner again. The 9th Circuit court noted that the
city conceded it is illegal to revise scoring standards after test
results are compiled.
   The case is San Francisco Police Officers Association vs. City
and County of San Francisco, 88-1984.

<HEAD>High Court Rejects Abandoned Property Case from Connecticut</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to bar states
from using abandoned property laws to recover some unclaimed
insurance benefits.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by an insurance
company ordered to turn over to Connecticut $2.5 million in
unclaimed benefits.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last February that
the state's power to collect the money is not pre-empted by the
federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), which
regulates pensions and other employee benefit programs.
   Aetna Life Insurance Co., which provides group health and
accident coverage for workers, said it should be allowed to keep
unclaimed benefits and use the money to lower its premiums or
increase benefits.
   The insurance company said tens of millions of dollars could be
at stake if all states sought to recover unclaimed benefits.
   Connecticut in 1981 amended its laws on abandoned property _ or
escheating _ to enable the state to acquire property left unclaimed
after three, rather than seven, years.
   The state said Aetna must turn over to it $2.5 million in
unclaimed benefits.
   A federal judge ruled in favor of Aetna but the 2nd Circuit
court reversed that decision.
   ``We think that the impact of Connecticut's escheat law on ERISA
benefit plans is too tenuous, remote and peripheral to require
pre-emption'' of the state law by the federal statute, the appeals
court said.
   The case is Aetna vs. Borges, 88-1883.

<HEAD>Jury-Selection Decision Expanded in 3 Southern States</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today allowed its decision
barring prosecutors from excluding potential jurors based on their
race to be applied to all non-criminal trials in three southern
states.
   The justices, over one dissenting vote, let stand a federal
appeals court ruling in a Georgia case that extended their 1986
decision to all civil trials.
   Although today's action sets no national precedent. It leaves
intact a binding precedent for courts in Georgia, Alabama and
Florida.
   Justice Byron R. White voted to hear arguments in the Georgia
case but four votes are needed to grant such review.
   The justices in 1986 curtailed dramatically the traditionally
broad power of prosecutors to bar prospective jurors from trials by
using ``peremptory'' or automatic challenges.
   The court ruled that the exclusion of potential jurors from any
criminal trial because of their race violates the equal-protection
rights of defendants and of those people excluded.
   At the time of the ruling, legal experts said it likely would
not apply to peremptory challenges made by defense lawyers in
criminal trials or to any civil, or non-criminal, trial.
   But the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last Jan. 17 took a
much more expansive view of the Supreme Court's 1986 ruling.
   The appeals court reinstated a lawsuit filed by a black man
against the Richmond County, Ga., deputy sheriff who shot him. The
appeals court said the trial judge must determine whether the
deputy sheriff's lawyer used two peremptory challenges to exclude
black potential jurors for non-racial reasons.
   ``We hold that (the 1986 ruling) applies in civil as well as
criminal cases,'' said the 11th Circuit court, which has
jurisdiction over Georgia, Alabama and Florida.
   Some government action must be present for the 14th Amendment's
guarantee of equal protection to be violated, but the appeals court
said such a violation can be found even in a lawsuit in which
neither the government nor a government employee is involved.
   ``When blacks are excluded from jury service on account of their
race ... the trial judge constitutes the discriminatory state
actor,'' the appeals court said.
   Although the appeals court did not say so, the decision's
rationale would appear to mean that the prohibition against
race-based juror exclusions applies to criminal defense lawyers as
well.
   In the Georgia case, deputy sheriff Frank Tiller shot Willie
Albert Fludd while attempting to apprehend a suspected narcotics
trafficker. Fludd sued Tiller in federal court under a much-used
civil rights law.
   The case is Tiller vs. Fludd, 88-2088.

<HEAD>Former Delta Pilot Fired for Flying While Drunk Loses Appeal to Regain
Job</HEAD>

   A former Delta Airlines pilot fired for
operating a commercial jet while drunk lost a Supreme Court appeal
today in his effort to win back his job.
   The justices, over one dissenting vote, let stand lower court
rulings that the pilot's reinstatement would be contrary to public
policy.
   A labor arbitration board previously had ordered his
reinstatement.
   Justice Byron R. White voted to hear arguments in the case but
four votes are needed to grant such review.
   William D. Day, a Boston-based pilot for Delta, was fired in
1985 after airline officials discovered he had been drunk while
commanding a flight from Bangor, Maine, to Boston.
   The flight was without incident.
   Shortly after his firing, Day was medically diagnosed as an
alcoholic. After treatment, he was recertified by the Federal
Aviation Administration.
   Day challenged his firing, and under the terms of a contract
Delta and his union, the Air Line Pilots Association, his grievance
was submitted to a five-member arbitration board.
   Comprised of two members appointed by the airline, two appointed
by the union and one neutral chairman, the board split 3-2 in
finding that Day had been fired without ``just cause.''
   Although stating that Day was guilty of serious misconduct, the
board concluded that he should have been offered the option of
enrolling in Delta's alcohol rehabilitation program. The board
ordered his reinstatement without back pay.
   Delta challenged the board's reinstatement order in federal
court, and U.S. District Judge Orinda Evans in Atlanta overturned
the board.
   ``Requiring Delta to cooperate with Day and the FAA in
recertifying Day is violative of public policy,'' the judge ruled.
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that ruling last
Dec. 8.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the Air Line Pilots
Association argued that the lower court rulings conflict with a
1987 Supreme Court decision that limited the power of federal
judges to overrule labor arbitrators.
   In that decision, the court ruled unanimously that judges may
reverse an arbitration award for public-policy reasons only if the
award creates an explicit conflict with laws or legal precedent.
   Such judicial reversals cannot be based on ``general
considerations f supposed public interest,'' the justices said in
their 1987 ruling.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the pilots' union
called the lower court rulings examples of ``the continuing erosion
of the doctrine of finality of arbitration awards.''
   They urged the justices to restore the arbitration board ruling
that would reinstate Day.
   The case is ALPA vs. Delta, 88-1901.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Impose One-Inmate-Per-Cell Limit at San Quentin</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to impose a
one-inmate-per-cell limit at San Quentin prison in California.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a state appeals court
ruling that putting two prisoners in one cramped cell does not
amount to constitutionally impermissible ``cruel and unusual
punishment.''
   Inmates sued state officials in 1981, challenging the
double-celling and other conditions at the maximum-security prison.
   Between 1977 and 1982, the number of inmates at San Quentin grew
from 2,000 to 3,400. By early 1983, the prison's general population
was 153 percent of design capacity.
   In the same years, the rate of violent incidents at San Quentin
increased dramatically. While the prison's general population grew
by 46 percent, treatments for assault-related injuries increased by
519 percent.
   Reported assaults, suicides and weapons-possession incidents
grew by 193 percent during the same period.
   State Judge Beverly Savitt in 1983 declared the conditions at
San Quentin to comprise cruel and unusual punishment. Among other
things, she ordered state prison officials to stop putting two
prisoners in cells designed for one.
   The cells are six feet wide, eight feet deep and eight feet
high. When two inmates are held inside such a cell, each prisoner
has less than nine square feet of usable space.
   A state appeals court reversed Savitt's double-celling ruling
last Dec. 12.
   ``The blanket ban on double celling cannot be sustained,'' the
appeals court ruled. Noting the surge in prison violence, the
appeals court said, ``The evidence does not support the finding
that double celling itself was the cause of the increase.''
   The California Supreme Court refused to review the inmates'
appeal last March 23.
   The state appeals court relied heavily on a 1981 decision by the
nation's highest court that upheld the use of double celling in an
Ohio prison.
   In that ruling, the justices said double celling in cells
designed for one prisoner is not necessarily unconstitutional.
   The case is Wilson vs. Deukmejian, 88-2090.

   Rain, floods and a tornado dealt cruel
new blows today to those trying to rebuild their lives and towns
devastated by Hurricane Hugo.
   The latest weather assault came amid a torrent of volunteer aid
from across the country, an effort boosted Sunday by a $1,000 check
by former President Reagan.
   Northeast of Charleston, a twister tore through the town of
Lebanon early today, tossing a house trailer that had stood through
the hurricane onto a road and injuring its two occupants. Neither
was hurt seriously, said Doris Browder, a dispatcher at the
Berkeley County Emergency Medical Service.
   ``The trailer was slung across the road,'' she said. ``I'm sure
most of their injuries were mental, not physical. They probably got
through the hurricane all right, then to have this happen.''
   Heavy rain fell throughout South Carolina on Sunday and into
early today, hampering cleanup efforts and forcing temporary
evacuation of 100 people in Anderson County in the state's
northwest corner. No injuries were reported, and the people
returned to their homes when the flood threat eased a few hours
later.
   Rain in South Carolina subsided by midmorning after about 2{
inches fell on Charleston. In North Charleston, 10 miles away,
about 2 inches of rain backed up storm sewers, scattered debris and
hampered cleanup efforts.
   ``I feel sorry for people. It's terrible. It adds insult to
injury,'' said Dick Schenot, meteorologist at the National Weather
Service.
   Torrential rain also fell on North Carolina residents trying to
clean up Hugo's wreckage, and trees left leaning by the hurricane
leaned farther or fell because of saturated soil. The rain in North
Caroline also swept a car into a creek, leaving three people
missing, and forced scores of people to evacuate.
   Disaster followed catastrophe in Greeleyville, when a gasoline
tanker truck exploded Sunday, injuring two and forcing 150 people
to flee their homes for three hours for fear of an explosion in
underground storage tanks. The town of 720 was battered by
Hurricane Hugo as it tore across the state.
   ``It would be terrible any time, but in connection with
everything else we've had, I'm sure it hit us a lot harder,''
Greeleyville Mayor Doris Browder said of the blast.
   The truck exploded Sunday as its driver was about to start
pumping gas into storage tanks at a convenience store, leaving the
driver with second- and third-degree burns and the store owner with
minor burns and bruises. The cause wasn't known.
   Residents of hard-hit Charleston took time out Sunday to salute
volunteers who have chipped in with money and goods and traveled to
the historic city to help cut away splintered trees, clear debris
and lend a hand with other cleanup chores.
   ``What you're doing will never be forgotten,'' Mayor Joseph
Riley told hundreds of weary workers who gathered at a rally Sunday
despite drizzle. ``People from all over the country came to help a
community in need. We might have suffered some damage, but our
spirit is alive.''
   Vice President Dan Quayle's wife, Marilyn, planned to tour the
damaged areas by helicopter and work at disaster centers in Moncks
Corner and Charleston this afternoon and Tuesday.
   Hugo, which belted the city Sept. 21 with 135 mph winds, where
more than 2,500 historically significant buildings were damaged.
   ``These people need help,'' said Steve Desin, a volunteer who
came to Charleston directly from working on the Alaskan oil spill
cleanup. ``This is what makes this country what it is. You can kick
our butts, but we'll fight back.''
   The Vallejo, Calif., native sent four vessels from his Cheetah
Aviation Transport Service to ferry food, clothes and medicine to
offshore islands cut off by the storm.
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency, which had 10 disaster
application centers open Sunday, planned to add four more centers
today, officials said. As of Sunday, 5,400 residents had applied
for various forms of federal and state assistance.
   Also today, beachfront property owners in Myrtle Beach, S.C.,
were told they could begin applying for permits to repair seawalls,
homes and businesses that were less than two-thirds damaged by the
hurricane.
   The Beachfront Management Act, enacted in 1988 to limit
development along South Carolina's 187-mile coast over bitter
opposition from many property owners, prohibits rebuilding or
repairs on shore structures that are more than two-thirds damaged.
About 5,500 structures in North Myrtle Beach, Myrtle Beach and
Georgetown County were damaged or destroyed, said Donna Gress,
spokeswoman for the South Carolina Coastal Council, which enforces
the law.

<HEAD>Cancer Institute Says Drug Combination Aids Colon Cancer Patients</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BETHESDA, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A drug used to deworm farm animals combined
with a common cancer drug has been found to save the lives of
patients who would have died from an advanced type of colon cancer,
the National Cancer Institute announced today.
   NCI Director Samuel Broder said that a national study involving
about 1,300 patients with a stage 3 type of colon cancer showed
increased survival rates for those treated with a drug called
levamisole in combination with 5-fluorouracil, a cancer drug now in
common use.
   The study was directed by Dr. Charles G. Moertel of the Mayo
Clinic.
   At a news conference today, Moertel said that the study showed
49 percent of stage III colon cancer patients were alive five years
after therapy with the drug combination compared to only 37 percent
of such patients who received no drugs. Both of the patient groups
being compared had been treated with surgery, which revealed that
the colon cancer had spread to nearby lymph nodes.
   In cancer therapy this stage of the disease is called Dukes' C.
   With today's announcement, Broder said that physicians are
encouraged to discuss this treatment option with patients at this
stage of colon cancer.
   He said the combination drug therapy is started three to five
weeks after surgery and is continued for about a year.
   Levamisole is a drug that is used by veterinarians to clear
worms from the intestine of barnyard animals. It is not now
approved by the Food and Drug Administration for any human use in
the United States.
   The drug, however, is commonly used in Europe to treat worm
infestation in humans and it has been used widely in experimental
treatment of cancers.
   Moertel said the drug combination of levamisole and
5-fluorouracil has not been proven effective against colon cancers
at an earlier stage in the disease or for those whose surgeries
occurred at a much earlier time.
   Broder said a specific description of this new treatment method
is being mailed to doctors around the country and that physicians
may obtain levamisole through the National Cancer Institute.

<HEAD>Unprecedented Protest March Held in `Independent' Homeland</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 25,000 blacks demanded
clemency for two condemned African National Congress guerrillas
today in the largest protest march ever held in one of South
Africa's nominally independent tribal homelands.
   The marchers, most of them schoolchildren, paraded peacefully
through the center of Umtata, capital of Transkei.
   Some carried African National Congress flags and displayed
placards urging the release of two members of the guerrilla
movement who are on death row in Transkei for a 1986 bombing which
killed two people at the Wild Coast Sun, a posh gambling resort
overlooking the Indian Ocean.
   The homeland's official radio estimated the crowd at 25,000 and
said police did not interfere.
   The protest came a day after Transkei's military leader, Maj.
Gen. Bantu Holomisa, declared at a funeral service that he would
consider holding a referendum to let homeland voters decide if they
wanted to rejoin South Africa.
   The Star, South Africa's largest daily newspaper, said the
government faced a ``major challenge to its grand apartheid plan''
if Holomisa proceeded with a referendum. The result, said The Star,
would be an overwhelming vote to rejoin South Africa, thus
repudiating the white government's longstanding contention that
blacks preferred autonomy in separate ethnic states.
   The homeland system also came under heavy criticism Sunday in
Botshabelo, a vast rural shantytown in the Orange Free State which
the government has placed under the jurisdiction of Qwaqwa, one of
six semi-autonomous homelands. An estimated 15,000 to 20,000 of
Botshabelo's 500,000 residents marched in protest against their
incorporation into Qwaqwa, which is 180 miles from their community.
   Many Botshabelo residents fear Qwaqwa may be declared
independent, thus depriving them of South African citizenship. Like
many other blacks, they feel South Africa, despite its segregation
laws, offers better opportunities than the impoverished homelands
in regard to pensions, employment and housing.
   South Africa's 28 million blacks have voting rights only in the
homelands and in local elections. National policy is controlled by
the 5 million whites.
   Holomisa, at the funeral Sunday of a tribal chief who opposed
Transkei's independence, shared a podium for the first time with
prominent anti-apartheid activists. Speakers at the service
denounced the homeland system and praised the late chief, Sabata
Dalindyebo, for his staunch opposition to the excision of Transkei
from South Africa in 1976.
   Transkei was the first of four homelands to accept
``independence'' from South Africa as part of a plan by white
officials to create separate nations for each major black tribe.
None of the four are recognized internationally.
   South Africa's foreign minister, Pik Botha, declined to comment
on Holomisa's statement, saying he had received no official
communication from Transkei. A ministry official, requesting
anonymity, said any bid by Transkei to renounce its independence
would be a matter for negotiations between South Africa and the
homeland.
   Holomisa, 34, took power in Transkei in a bloodless coup in
1987. He is the first leader of a nominally independent homeland to
make favorable references to the African National Congress and he
reportedly held secret talks earlier this year with the group's
exiled president, Oliver Tambo.
   Transkei lies along South Africa's southern coast between the
port cities of Durban and East London. It covers about 18,000
square miles and has about 3.5 million residents.

   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether police nationwide may try to curb drunken driving by
stopping motorists at sobriety checkpoints.
   The justices said they will review Michigan court rulings that
struck down that state's sobriety checkpoint program as an
unconstitutional invasion of privacy.
   Courts in other states have upheld virtually identical
checkpoint programs.
   Michigan state police first used sobriety checkpoints, modeled
after a program used in Maryland, in 1986.
   At a checkpoint site, police directed all traffic headed in one
direction to a roadside area where officers checked motorists for
signs of intoxication.
   If there was no immediate evidence of intoxication, the motorist
was given a traffic safety brochure and allowed to drive away. The
average delay was about 30 seconds.
   If some signs of intoxication were detected, a driver was
directed to another area for further questioning and perhaps a
breath test.
   At one such checkpoint, Michigan state police troopers checked
126 vehicles in less than an hour and detained two drivers for
sobriety field tests. One driver was arrested on drunken-driving
charges.
   The state police department was sued soon after the checkpoint
program began. The lawsuit alleged that the checkpoints violated
the Fourth Amendment's ban on unreasonable police searches and
seizures.
   A state judge and a state appeals court ruled that the
checkpoint program was unconstitutional. The appeals court cited
``the potential for an unreasonable subjective intrusion on
individual liberty interests.''
   The Michigan Supreme Court last Feb. 22 refused to review the
lower court rulings.
   In other action today, the court:
   _ Agreed to decide whether public employers may be forced to put
aside partisanship when hiring, promoting and transferring workers.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by two men and a woman who
said their job status suffered because they didn't support the
Republican Party in Illinois.
   _ Let states file criminal charges against employers accused of
neglecting the health and safety of workers.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling in an Illinois
case that federal workplace regulations do not bar such state
prosecutions.
   _ Agreed to consider increasing the federal government's power
to keep some accused criminals behind bars while they await trial.
   The court said it will review a ruling in a New Mexico case that
forces the government to free, on bail, some defendants deemed to
be dangerous or a risk to flee before trial.
   _ Turned aside an appeal by three people convicted of
trespassing for handing out anti-abortion booklets to students
outside a Texas high school.
   The court, without comment, let stand rulings that distribution
of the ``pro-life'' literature on school grounds was not protected
by the Constitution's free-speech guarantees.
   _ Turned away an appeal by an evangelical Christian group
ordered to return most of the $6.5 million donated by a wealthy
ex-member.
   The court, without comment, let stand rulings that the group,
The Bible Speaks, received the donations after exerting undue
influence on department store heiress Elizabeth Dayton Dovydenas.
   The religious group now must return $5.5 million.
   _ Refused to revive an allegedly abused foster child's federal
lawsuit against the social workers and government agency that
placed him in his foster home.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a federal appeals court
ruling in a Maryland case that no such right to sue exists.
   _ Turned away appeals by eight Mafia figures from New York City
convicted in the 1979 killings of crime chieftain Carmine Galante
and two of his associates.
   The court, without comment, let stand the federal racketeering
convictions of family bosses Anthony Salerno, Anthony Corallo and
Carmine Persico, high-ranking mobsters Salvatore Santoro,
Christopher Furnari and Gennaro Langella, and mob members Anthony
Indelicato and Ralph Scopo.
   In the sobriety-checkpoint appeal acted on today, Michigan
Attorney General Frank Kelley referred to the ``grave and
legitimate public interest'' in fighting drunken driving. He asked
the justices to resolve conflictig state court rulings.
   Kelley said Michigan's checkpoint program is valid even if it is
not the most effective police procedure available or may carry the
``potential of generating fear and surprise in some motorists.''
   The state police department's appeal was supported in
``friend-of-the-court'' briefs submitted by the Michigan chapter of
Mothers Against Drunk Driving, the American Alliance for Rights and
Responsibilities and a group called Remove Intoxicated Drivers.
   Lawyers for those who successfully challenged the checkpoint
program urged the justices to reject the appeal.
   They said the ``warrantless, suspicionless siezure'' of a
vehicle at a sobriety checkpoint could lead to drivers and
passengers being required to get out and being subjected to
pat-down searches. They said police officers may use such occasions
to inspect a vehicle's contents.
   The Supreme Court in 1979 barred police from randomly stopping
vehicles to check registration papers. In that case, officers had
total discretion over which vehicles were stopped.
   But the 1979 decision in a Delaware case did not rule out spot
checks in which an officer's discretion was not so unconstrained.
``Questioning of all oncoming traffic at road block-type stops is
one possible alternative,'' the decision said.
   The case acted on today is Michigan Department of State Police
vs. Sitz, 88-1897.

   Paul Manafort, a Republican consultant with
ties to Presidents Bush and Reagan, told a House panel today he
``played by the rules'' in obtaining lucrative, multimillion-dollar
federal housing subsidies.
   Manafort came under sharp and hostile questioning today in his
second appearance before the House Government Operations
subcommittee on employment and housing, the panel that has been
investigating influence-peddling and mismanagement at the
Department of Housing and Urban Development.
   Manafort, a former campaign adviser to Bush and ex-President
Reagan and a former business partner of Republican National
Committee Chairman Lee Atwater, failed to recall all the HUD
projects he was involved in when he appeared before the same panel
last June, and later sent two letters recounting additional
projects.
   He told the subcommittee today that he and others at his
lobbying firm _ Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly _ had failed to
fully check all of the firm's records and had initially overlooked
some projets, but not had disclosed them all.
   He underwent extensive quetioning about a New Jersey housing
project which he purchased, with other partners, after first
obtaining commitments from HUD for more than $31 million in
renovation subsidies and tax credits.
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., chairman of the panel, pressed
Manafort for details of the deal and suggested that Manafort and
his partners enjoyed an inside line to HUD officials and benefitted
from HUD specifications that were written to exclude other
developers.
   ``It was a tailor-made award,'' Lantos said.
   Manafort, however, said his firm ``has worked within the
existing system at HUD.''
   ``We played by the rules,'' Manafort said. ``I understand that
the subcommittee views the process as fundamentally flawed. I am
not here to argue with the subcommittee about the process, or to
defend it ....''
   Lantos said subcommittee staffers inspected the Seabrook housing
project in Upper Deerfield, N.J., last week and found conditions
``shocking'' and ``a slum.'' He said one mother had no refrigerator
in her apartment, which rented with federal subsidies for $700 a
month.
   Manafort said the project was still under renovation and
asserted, ``When we are finished with construction, we believe the
tenants will be happy.''
   Also scheduled to testify were two employees of Manafort's firm,
Richard Davis, a veteran of the Reagan White House, and Lawrence
Gay, whom Manafort said had met with Deborah Gore Dean when she was
executive assistant to then-Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr.
   Also appearing was Victor Cruse, a partner with Manafort in the
Seabrook housing project in New Jersey.
   In previous testimony before the subcommittee, some local
officials have said they opposed the New Jersey project which
Manafort won subsidies for.
   ``It's a very peculiar case of influence-peddling,'' Lantos said.
   Testifying in June, Manafort acknowledged that his work on that
project amounted to influence-peddling.
   Manafort said his Alexandria, Va., lobbying firm of Black,
Manafort, Stone &amp; Kelly did relatively little HUD business. But in
following weeks, the firm's involvement with developers on projects
in New Jersey, Connecticut, Georgia and Puerto Rico came to light.
   ``Manafort said that basically was it,'' said Stuart Weisberg,
the subcommittee's staff director. ``Then we got two letters of
clarification.''
   Manafort's two letters to the panel following his initial
appearance detailed more business _ and one of the letters came
after a New York Times report revealed a Connecticut project he
hadn't mentioned.
   ``He missed so much that if it were a college exam, he would
have failed it,'' Weisberg said then.
   Pierce last week followed Dean in refusing to testify before the
House subcommittee, citing his Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination and charging he had been ``prejudged'' by the
panel.
   Two other former HUD officials _ Dean's predecessor as executive
assistant, Lance Wilson, and former deputy secretary Hunter Cushing
_ have also refused to testify before the subcommittee.
   Despite their refusal, the subcommittee has not moved to offer
immunity from prosecution to any witnesses as a way to break the
impasse. Weisberg said the refusal ``just means more work for us''
and that the panel will use other witnesses to shed light on the
activity of the HUD higher-ups.
   Most panel members have stopped short of calling for a special
prosecutor to be named to investigate Pierce and are awaiting his
second subpoenaed appearance in late October to see if he will
change his mind.
   ``I believe he has a moral obligation, having served as
secretary of an important federal agency, to tell the American
people about his activities,'' Lantos said. ``I very much hope
Secretary Pierce will testify.''

<HEAD>Illinois Residents Trying to Stop Nuclear Power Plants Lose Appeal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of Illinois residents trying to halt
operations at three nuclear power plants in the state lost their
Supreme Court appeal today.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling by the federal
Nuclear Regulatory Commission that the residents' concerns over
safety are unfounded.
   Six people filed a petition with the commission in 1986 seeking
the suspension of the operating licenses of three northern Illinois
plants _ Zion, LaSalle and Byron.
   The petition voiced concern over the spread of radioactive
material from the plants if a nuclear accident occurred. It alleged
that inadequate leak-rate testing of containments at the three
plants owned by Commonwealth Edison Co. had created an unsafe
condition.
   The commission denied the petition after the director of its
Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation determined there were no
safety problems.
   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last Feb. 3 that it
lacked the jurisdiction to second-guess the commission's action.
   The appeal acted on today contended that the appeals court erred
in that conclusion.
   The residents who initiated the licensing challenge are Jacob
Aronov, Eckhard Festag, David Kraft, Susan Michetti, Patricia
Schaffner and Abe Sklar.
   The case is Citizens of Illinois vs. NRC, 88-1923.

<HEAD>Court Begins Term With Abortion Issue Heading Closely Watched Cases</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: Inserts grafs 19-20, In a, with booklet-distribution case.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court begins its new term much
where it left off last summer _ with the issue of abortion heading
the list of closely watched cases.
   After a three-month recess, the justices return to the bench
today to begin deliberations in a variety of controversial legal
and political disputes. None is likely to be more divisive, or a
better bellwether of the court's conservative course, than abortion.
   The court will hear arguments in three abortion cases, probably
in December or January, that will determine whether it will expand
the new regulatory power it gave states last July.
   Harvard University law professor Laurence Tribe said the July
ruling ``began, in a very major way, the dismantling of Roe versus
Wade,'' the court's 1973 ruling that established a right to
abortion.
   ``The court may never say Roe versus Wade is overruled, but is
likely to say, `Roe versus Wade ... never heard of it,''' Tribe
said.
   Officials from Minnesota and Ohio are urging the justices to
allow laws requiring young, unmarried girls to get parental consent
before having abortions. In the third case, Illinois is seeking
stricter control over clinics that perform the great majority of
abortions.
   The state officials are not asking the court to overturn Roe vs.
Wade, which legalized abortions nationwide.
   The Bush administration, which urged the court last term to
reverse the 1973 ruling, is taking a lower profile this time.
   The Justice Department will not participate in oral arguments in
any of the three cases, although it is expected to submit a legal
brief supporting Minnesota's parental consent law.
   The abortion debate in America was recast dramatically by the
court's July 3 ruling in a Missouri case cutting back abortion
rights and letting states make abortions harder to obtain.
   The court, by a 5-4 vote, said states may require doctors to
administer tests for determining whether a fetus is capable of
surviving outside the womb.
   It also ruled that states may ban even privately paid abortions
in public hospitals.
   Holding the balance of power in that case _ and perhaps for the
future of abortion rights _ is Sandra Day O'Connor, the only female
justice in the court's history.
   In a separate concurring opinion in July, she said the Missouri
regulations do not place an ``undue burden'' on a woman's right to
an abortion. O'Connor said she was not prepared to decide then
whether the right established 16 years ago now should be discarded.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Anthony M.
Kennedy and Byron R. White are ready to overturn Roe vs. Wade.
Justice Antonin Scalia voted to do so.
   Justices Harry A. Blackmun, William J. Brennan, Thurgood
Marshall and John Paul Stevens reaffirmed their support of the 1973
holding.
   The July ruling has made abortion a hotter issue for the state
legislatures, where rejuvenated women's rights activists and
anti-abortion forces are taking the battle.
   But the Supreme Court remains an important arena for the fight.
   In a free-speech case, the court today turned aside an appeal by
three people convicted of trespassing for handing out anti-abortion
booklets to students outside a Texas high school.
   The court, without comment, let stand rulings that distribution
of the ``pro-life'' literature on school grounds was not protected
by the Constitution's free-speech guarantees.
   Here is a look at the three abortion cases on the court docket
this term:
   _The Illinois case, Turnock vs. Ragsdale, could be the most
important. The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals struck down
regulations a trial judge said would force abortion clinics to
become ``the functional equivalent of small hospitals.''
   The clinics, where nearly all early abortions are performed,
would be required to provide elaborate medical equipment and
services that the clinics say are unnecessary for patient safety.
The cost of an abortion could rise by nearly $50.
   The case could have broad significance if the court decides to
water down or scrap its trimester approach to abortion rights
established by Roe vs. Wade. That ruling generally prohibits states
from imposing health regulations that make abortions more expensive
or difficult to obtain in the first three months of pregnancy.
   _In Hodgson vs. Minnesota, the court will review a system that
requires both parents of an unmarried girl under 18 to receive
notification from the doctor 48 hours before an abortion is
performed. Alternatively, the girl may bypass parental notification
by convincing a judge she is mature enough to choose abortion for
herself.
   The system was in force for five years before a federal judge
ruled it was unconstitutional. But the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals reversed the judge's ruling.
   _The second parental notification case, Ohio vs. Akron Center
for Reproductive Health, raises similar issues. An Ohio law
requires the physician to give notice in person or by telephone to
one parent 24 hours prior to the abortion, or by regular and
certified mail 48 hours in advance.
   Alternatively, a judge would have up to 22 days to decide
whether to permit the minor's abortion.
   The Ohio law, passed in 1985, never took effect before it was
struck down by a federal judge whose ruling was upheld by the 6th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   The Supreme Court has allowed states to regulate abortions for
unmarried minors more strictly than for adult women.
   The justices, in a decision announced two months before Kennedy
joined the court, split 4-4 in 1987 over the validity of such
regulation by Illinois.

<HEAD>State Workers Who Don't Want to Pay Equivalent of Union Dues Lose
Appeal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to hear an
appeal by non-union Pennsylvania state employees who oppose paying
the equivalent of dues to a union that represents them in
collective bargaining.
   The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that the
employees' rights were not violated when they were forced to
financially support the union's negotiating efforts.
   The employees are challenging the deduction from their paychecks
of what is known as agency fees. The fees average $263 a year per
worker and are paid in lieu of union dues.
   The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees
(AFSME) is the collective-bargaining agent for Pennsylvania's state
employees, union and non-union members alike.
   The union signed an agrement with state officials July 28, 1988,
to deduct the agency fees from some 18,000 non-union employees
beginning the following month.
   Fifteen non-union employees sued in federal court to block the
deductions. They said the fees violate their constitutional rights
because some of the money would be used to support causes and
politicians they do not support _ including Gov. Robert Casey of
Pennsylvania.
   After the suit was filed, the union agreed to place the fees in
an escrow account _ barring their use by the union _ until an
arbitrator decides whether the union may use the money or refund it.
   The non-union members then sought a court order returning the
money to them and barring the union from collecting any further
deductions pending outcome of the case.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied the injunction last
February, ruling that the non-union employees failed to show they
will suffer irreparable harm if the fees continue to be placed in
escrow.
   The appeals court relied heavily on a 1986 Supreme Court
decision that set guidelines for the use of agency fees. In that
ruling, the justices allowed fee deductions from non-union workers
as long as the money is not used, even temporarily, to ``finance
ideological activities unrelated to collective bargaining.''
   The 3rd Circuit court rejected arguments by the non-union
Pennsylvania employees that temporarily depriving them of the fees
violates their free-speech rights even if the money is held in
escrow.
   The case is Hohe vs. Casey, 89-51.

   Police fired tear gas and used batons
today to disperse about 2,000 Pakistanis who tried to demonstrate
at a house where Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto is staying
during her official visit, witnesses said.
   The witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said police
fired at least 15 rounds of tear gas and used steel-tipped batons
when the demonstrators tried to force their way to the state-run
guest house.
   Ms. Bhutto was in the guest house when the demnonstration
occurred.
   Ms. Bhutto arrived in Dhaka Sunday on a three-day visit, the
first by a Pakistani head of government in 15 years.
   The demonstrators were among the 250,000 people who demand
repatriation to Pakistan. They opted for Pakistani citizenship in
1971 when Bangladesh became independent by breaking away from
Pakistan after a 9-month-long liberation war.
   The demonstrators wanted to submit a memorandum to Ms. Bhutto
pleading their case.
   The stranded Pakistani live in 66 camps across Bangladesh.
   Bangladesh and Pakistan, meanwhile, signed a cultural protocol
to promote exchanges on education, information and arts and culture.
   The agreement was signed after Ms. Bhutto held talks with
Bangladesh President Hussain Muhammad Ershad.
   Pakistani Foreign Affairs Advisor Iqbal Akhand told reporters
that the two leaders held ``free and frank discussions'' on all
issues. ``We have no problem between us,'' He said without
elaborating.
   Bangladesh Foreign Minister Anisul Islam said the two leaders
would meet again. ``It is a goodwill visit,'' Islam said without
elaborating.
   The two leaders also dicussed the issue of the stranded
Pakistanis.
   After the talks Ms. Bhutto flew to Jaipurhat, 130 miles north of
Dhaka to the lay the foundation stone of an orphanage.
   Earlier today, she visited the national mausoleum for the
independence war martyars at Savar, outskirts of Dhaka.
   The Pakistani prime minister paid homage to the martyrs who
fought against Pakistani during the liberation war.

<HEAD>Key House Members Tentatively Agree On Clean Air Compromise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Key House members, breaking a 10-year
congressional stalemate, have tentatively agreed to a compromise on
clean air legislation that would substantially reduce automobile
pollution through 2003, congressional sources said today.
   The agreement would require the nation to accept standards
already approved for California, the state with the worst smog
pollution problem and the toughest emissions requirements.
   The anti-smog requirements would remain in effect nationally
until 2003, and could be tightened after that if a federal study
showed more reductions were necessary, the sources said.
   Signing on to the privately negotiated agreement were Reps. John
D. Dingell, D-Mich., who has represented views of the auto
industry, and Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif. a strong backer of
environmental groups.
   Waxman's demand for much tougher auto standards, and Dingell's
resistance, has led to a stalemate that played a large role in
blocking a new clean air bill for a decade.
   The Energy and Commerce Committee members who signed on to the
agreement have pledged to honor the pact through the entire
legislative process, said the sources, who spoke only on condition
they not be named. Dingell is chairman of the full committee, and
Waxman heads the environment subcommittee that currently is
considering amendments to President Bush's clean air bill.
   The agreement will be written as an amendment to the auto
pollution section of Bush's legislation, a section recently amended
in subcommittee to eliminate averaging of pollution emissions and
to require on-board canisters to capture gasoline vapors.
   The agreement would require a study before 2003 by the
Environmental Protection Agency and congressional Office of
Technology Assessment, to determine if more emissions reductions
would be needed.
   The EPA administrator could decide to tighten the standards as a
result of the study or leave them alone. If he does nothing,
standards already proposed by Waxman would automatically become
effective.
   The agreement also would include controls on toxic chemicals
coming from automobiles, the sources said.
   California now requires nitrogen oxide emissions be limited to
0.4 grams per mile up to 50,000 miles. Beginning 1995, California's
hydrocarbon limits _ to be written into federal law _ will be 0.25
grams per mile for 50,000 miles and 0.31 grams between 50,000 and
100,000 miles.
   The carbon monoxide standard is 3.4 grams for 50,000 miles and
4.2 grams between 50,000 and 100,000 miles.
   Current federal standards outside California are 0.41 grams per
mile for hydrocarbons, 1 gram for nitrogen oxides and 3.4 grams for
carbon monoxide.
   ``With Waxman and Dingell agreeing, I don't see who can keep it
out of the law,'' one source said of the new standards.
   Chief Senate clean air sponsors already have proposed tough
emissions requirements, but the amendment process has not yet
started in that chamber.
   Those who negotiated the agreement, besides Dingell and Waxman,
include Rep. Norman F. Lent, R-N.Y., Michael Bilirakis, R-Fla.,
Terry Bruce, D-Ill, Ralph M. Hall, D-Texas, Mike Synar, D-Okla. and
Thomas Tauke, R-Iowa.

<HEAD>Court To Decide on Lawyer's Fees in California Civil Rights Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether lawyers who win civil rights cases can collect a big chunk
of their clients' awards under an agreement made when the attorneys
were hired.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by a California man
awarded $2.12 million and then ordered to pay 40 percent of the
judgment to his lawyer.
   The case stems from a federal lawsuit by Juan Francisco Venegas
against Long Beach police officers. Venegas was imprisoned for 2{
years for a murder conviction obtained with perjured evidence,
according to court records.
   Venegas hired Michael Mitchell to represent him in the suit and
agreed to a pay the lawyer 40 percent of any award he won.
   A federal court also awarded Mitchell $75,000 in legal fees, an
amount to be paid by the police officers.
   Mitchell and Venegas parted ways in 1986 when the lawyer asked
for another 10 percent of the judgment to represent him on appeal
and Venegas refused.
   The lawyer then filed a court motion to place a lien on the
judgment to recover his 40 percent contingent fee, or $406,000.
   A federal judge gave Mitchell a partial victory, ruling he may
be entitled to the contingent fee but leaving the matter to a state
court to decide.
   Mitchell won a bigger victory before the 9th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals.
   The appeals court last April sent the case back to the federal
judge to reconsider the lawyer's bid to enforce a lien on the $2.12
million award.
   The appeals court also said that under federal civil rights law,
Mitchell is not limited to court-awarded attorneys' fees when a
contingency fee agreement exists with a client.
   Federal law ``does not place a ceiling on an attorney's
entitlement under a contingency fee agreement,'' the appeals court
said. ``Fairness requires that we respect the freedom of clients
and attorneys to agree to a contingency fee in excess'' of any
court award.
   Venegas also argued that Mitchell misled him when they made the
contingency fee agreement. Venegas said Mitchell did not tell him
about the benefits the lawyer was entitled to receive under federal
civil rights law.
   The case is Venegas vs. Mitchell, 88-1725.

<HEAD>Soil Erosion Threatens Farmland's Productivity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New technology is expected to boost crop
yields sharply over the next few decades, but an Agriculture
Department study says soil erosion continues as a threat to the
productivity of farmland over the long haul.
   In its projections announced on Sept. 21, the USDA said only
around 220 million acres of cropland may be required by 2030 to
meet U.S. domestic and export needs, compared with more than 380
million acres used in 1982, the base year for the study.
   The report is the second appraisal of the nation's soil and
water resources since Congress ordered the periodic studies in the
Resource Conservation Act of 1977.
   Regardless of technological advances and higher annual crop
yields, the 280-page report also says erosion from water runoff and
wind are long-term threats to the land's productivity.
   And it is difficult to measure. Erosion reduces yields when it
is severe, sometimes by up to 50 percent.
   ``Generally, however, only a very small amount of soil is moved
in any given year,'' the report said. ``The resulting annual loss
in productivity is so small that it is hidden by differences in the
weather or in the management farmers apply from year to year.''
   In many soils, it said, crop yields may not appear to decrease
at all, even if erosion is excessive, because the farmer has
switched to improved, higher-yielding varieties of crops, or is
applying more fertilizer, or controlling pests more effectively.
   To help show what is involved in long-term soil erosion,
researchers devised computer models to simulate ``the effects of
many years of erosion on many kinds of soil'' under various
conditions and systems.
   Using 1982 management conditions and not allowing for technology
improvements, the computer program looked at what might happen to
the nation's 421 million acres of cropland after 100 years of
``sheet and rill'' erosion from water runoff, and wind erosion.
   Overall, according to the computer, cropland productivity would
be reduced by less than 3 percent a century from now.
   ``The projected national percentage of loss is low because many
soils are not losing any productivity under current (farm)
management,'' the report said.
   In other words, some of the nation's soil is being naturally
replaced as rapidly as it is being eroded. But other soils erode at
several times the ``tolerance'' value, or replacement rate.
   And on very fragile soils, even slight erosion results in
significant yield reductions, the report said. On some of these,
after a century, productivity loss was projected to be quite high.
   ``Loss of productivity after 100 years is projected to be as
high as 60 percent along the central California Coast Range, and as
high as 50 percent in the Great Valley of Virginia,'' the report
said.
   Another point to keep in mind is that ``a century is a short
time in the existence of a soil _ or a society,'' the report said.
``Some soils in the eastern part of the nation have been cultivated
for as much as 300 years.''
   Even a 100-year period ``can be misleading as an indicator of
the long-term effects of erosion,'' it said.
   According to the computer study, after 100 years it would take
more than 6 million ``equivalent'' acres to replace the
productivity lost as a result of erosion. That is not the same as
the amount of land damaged by water and wind.
   ``Rather, equivalent acres are the number of additional acres
that would be needed, after 100 years of erosion, to match current
production levels, assuming constant technology,'' the report said.
``The greatest number of equivalent acres would be needed in the
Corn Belt, where millions of acres used for growing feed grains are
projected to sustain moderate losses in productivity.''
   Iowa would require 617,000 equivalent acres after 100 years to
replace its productivity lost from water erosion.
   Others in the top 10 states in terms of projected losses
include: Illinois, 569,000 acres; Missouri 413,000; Indiana,
389,000; Kentucky, 358,000; Pennsylvania, 333,000; Ohio, 310,000;
New York, 261,000; Nebraska, 246,000; and California, 235,000.
   Much of the wind erosion would be concentrated in the Great
Plains states. Texas was projected at 380,000 acres after 100
years; Colorado, 128,000; Montana, 108,000; Washington, 76,000;
Idaho, 66,000; South Dakota, 50,000; Kansas, 43,000; Nevada,
31,000; Nebraska, 19,000; and Oklahoma, 19,000.

   Can American wines really fin a home in
France? Some experts think so, and the Agriculture Department has
some figures to back up the optimism.
   Last year, says Holly S. Higgins of the department's Foreign
Agricultural Service, U.S. wine sales to France totaled $1.2
million. Although that is a tiny part of French imports totaling
$322 million in 1988, it still is up sharply from only $155,000 in
1985.
   Higgins, until recently the U.S. agricultural attache in Paris,
says there is little doubt that French demand for wine remains
strong. Per capita consumption is 75 liters annually, compared with
nine liters for Americans. Approximately 80 percent of all wine
consumed in France is red.
   ``Prospects for greater U.S. sales in the French market are
bright,'' Higgins writes in the October issue of the agency's
AgExporter magazine. ``U.S. exporters can expect the French market
to expand in the future as U.S. wines gain acceptance and find
their niche in the marketplace.''

   Cigarette exports increased this summer from
year-earlier levels, but overseas sales of U.S. leaf tobacco were
down, according to an Agriculture Department report.
   The July cigarette shipments totaled 10.8 billion ``pieces''
valued at $267.7 million, the department's Foreign Agricultural
Service said. Both the quantity of cigarettes and their value were
up 6 percent from July 1988.
   However, exports of unmanufactured tobacco in July totaled 7,064
metric tons, down 41 percent from a year earlier, the report said.
The July value of $48 million was down 27 percent.

   Two armed bandits forced a goldsmith to pull
off a Turin highway and stole a nine-pound silver soccer ball worth
more than $100,000, police said Monday.
   The ball, a trophy which was to be presented to the outstanding
goalkeeper at the 1990 World Cup Soccer Championships in Italy, had
been on display at a jewelry exhibit in Torino. At the close of the
exhibit Sunday, the trophy was entrusted to artisan Angelo Augero,
who intended to bring it to his home in Asti.
   The goldsmith barely made it out of Torino before the robbers
pulled alongside him Sunday night and forced him off the road at
gunpoint.

   Former President Habib Bourguiba, who was
ousted in a coup nearly two years ago, has been hospitalized,
doctors said Monday.
   Bourguiba, 86, who underwent prostate surgery 2{ months ago, was
being cared for at Charles Nicole Hospital in Tunis. Doctors said
he was admitted Friday and would remain there two to three weeks.
   An official source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Bourguiba was suffering from a urinary problem.
   On Nov. 7, 1987, Bourguiba was overthrown in a bloodless coup
led by the current president, Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali.
   On July 17, Bourguiba underwent prostate surgery in Paris and
was hospitalized for a month.

   Japan's ``bullet train,'' named for its shape and
high speed, is 25 years old.
   The train began service Oct. 1, 1964, running at speeds up to
131 mph and making the 324-mile run between Tokyo and Osaka, in
western Japan, in 3 hours and 20 minutes.
   Since then, the bullet trains have carried 2.7 billion
passengers between Tokyo and Osaka, Tomoko Shimokawa, a spokeswoman
for Japan Railways, said Monday. Japan Railways is the private
company that replaced the government-owned railroad in April 1987.
   The train never has been involved in a major accident.
   The introduction of the bullet train in 1964, shortly before the
Olympic Games in Tokyo, was seen as a symbol of Japan's remarkable
postwar economic recovery.
   The Tokyo-Osaka run has been cut to three hours, with trains
running at up to 138 mph, Ms. Shimokawa said.
   In 1975, the original line from Tokyo was extended past Osaka to
Hakata, on the southernmost main island of Kyushu, 563 miles west
of Tokyo.
   In the late 1980s, new lines were added from Tokyo to Morioka,
289 miles to the north, and from Tokyo to Niigata, 160 miles
northwest of the capital.
   The fastest train on the line to Morioka runs up to 150 mph, the
railway says.

<HEAD>Demonstrators Demand Release of Dissident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 1,000 people demonstrated Monday
outside a jail to demand the release of a Taiwanese dissident who
was arrested as he sneaked back into the country after 10 years of
exile in the United States.
   Inside the jail, which was heavily guarded by barricades and
hundreds of riot police, High Court prosecutor Chen Yao-neng
questioned the dissident, publisher Hsu Hsin-liang, about sedition
charges filed against him in connection with riots 10 years ago.
   The demonstrators, mostly members of the oppositon Democratic
Progressive Party, waved banners and shouted ``Hsu Hsin-liang not
guilty!'' They demanded he be released on bail. Several protesters
set off firecrackers to celebrate Hsu's return.
   The four-hour protest ended without incident.
   Prosecutors have rejected a request by Hsu's lawyer, Chen
Shui-pien, that Hsu be freed on bond.
   Hsu, 48, was arrested Wednesday after coast guard officials
found him hiding in a fishing boat off the southern Taiwanese port
of Kaohsiung as he was attempting to sneak back into the country.
   He had tried three other times since 1979 to return to Taiwan
but was turned back when airliners observed a Taiwan government
demand he not be allowed to board Taiwan-bound flights. Government
officials feared Hsu's return would trigger political unrest.
   Military prosecutors in 1980 filed sedition charges against Hsu
for his alleged involvement in anti-government riots in Kaohsiung
in 1979.
   The riots broke out two months after Hsu left for the United
States, but authorities said he helped organized them.
   Military authorities also accused Hsu of advocating
anti-government movements that support an independent Taiwan.
   The Nationalist government, which fled to Taiwan after losing a
civil war to Communist forces in 1949 on the Chinese mainland,
still claims to be the ruler of all China and opposes an
independent state of Taiwan.
   Hsu has denied the charges against him.

   The government Monday warned radical
students to stop burning U.S. flags and ordered a crackdown to halt
anti-American protests on college campuses.
   Information Minister Choe Byung-yul said the government was
concerned about burning of U.S. flags by radical students and would
no longer allow such anti-American outbursts.
   ``The government cannot help being deeply concerned by the
deplorable activities occurring at some universities recently,
where students are profaning a traditionally friendly nation's
flag,'' Choe said in a statement.
   Radical students, a smallnority on colleg but powerful mie
campuses, have burned American flags and effigies of American
officials to demand withdrawal of the 43,000 U.S. troops based in
South Korea. The students claim the Seoul government is a front for
U.S. military rule.
   The number of radical demonstrations against the South Korean
government and the United States has declined in recent months,
partly because of a major police crackdown on dissidents. The
radicals have also lost support because of their extreme views and
sympathy for communist North Korea.

   Israel has asked the United States for $400
million in housing loan guarantees for about 100,000 Soviet Jews
expected in the country now that Washington has tightened its visa
rules, officials said today.
   Washington said today it would study the request. The request
was made by Finance Minister Shimon Peres, who returned Friday from
a trip to Washington, ministry spokesman Arieh Greenblatt said.
   It will cost an estimated $3 billion to educate, house and
employ the immigrants, Greenblatt said.
   He said that about one-third of that total would be sought from
the United States, including $600 million in donations from
American Jews and $400 million through U.S.-guaranteed loans.
   The guarantees would allow Israel to borrow money from
commercial banks at low interest. U.S. law limits loan guarantees
to $25 million per country per year.
   Simcha Dinitz, chairman of the quasi-government Jewish Agency,
which helps resettle refugees, told Israel radio today that about
100,000 Soviet immigrants were expected over the next three to five
years.
   Questions have been raised about whether Israeli plans to settle
some of the immigrants in the occupied West Bank might interfere
with Middle East peace efforts.
   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
that, while Israel's request for $400 million in loan guarantees
was being studied, the Bush administration would reject any effort
to help resettle immigrants in occupied territories.
   ``Our policy is we don't allow U.S. aid to be use for
resettlement in the West Bank,'' Fitzwater said.
   The spokesman said that Bush discussed the situation in general
terms with Peres last week when the president was in New York to
address the United Nations.
   ``The president emphasized his sympth;ay for that problem and
committed to look into it. But we haven't discussed any
specifics,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``We do anticipate growing numbers of Jewish immigrants wanting
to settle in Israel. There may be costs associated with that,''
Fitzwater said.
   But he added that, while the United States would do would it
could to help, there was no way it was going to provide money to
help Israel settle immigrants in the West Bank.
   Israel has occupied the West Bank _ home to one million
Palestinians and 70,000 Jewish settlers _ since the 1967 Middle
East war.
   Israeli Housing Minister David Levy recommended in June that new
immigrants be put in West Bank settlements.
   But the U.S. has repeatedly called on Israel to stop settlement
activity there, a major issue in the Arab-Israeli conflict. At
least 575 Palestinians and 40 Israelis have died in the
21-month-old Arab uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip against
Israeli rule.
   Effective Sunday, the United States changed its visa rules to
stem the flood of Soviet immigrants. Washington said the embassy in
Moscow faces a backlog of 32,000 applicants. Of the 10,000 new
applications in August, 45 percent were Jews.
   In addition, thousands of Soviet Jews who accepted Israeli visas
are waiting at other European sites in hopes of getting visas to
America. But Israel has long pressed Washington to encourage Soviet
Jews to emigrate to Israel instead of the United States.
   Moscow-based Jewish activists say that many Soviet Jews seeking
to emigrate to the United States may remain in the Soviet Union
rather than leave for Israel.
   The American Jewish Committee estimates that more than 170,000
Soviet Jews immigrated to Israel between 1965 and 1988.
   The Soviet Jewish Education and Information Center in Jerusalem
says that of the 18,961 Jews who emigrated from the Soviet Union
last year, 2,173 came to Israel. In the first eight months this
year, 4,175 of the 34,610 Soviet Jewish emigres came to Israel.

<HEAD>Construction Spending Posts Its Biggest Advance This Year in August</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Construction spending posted its biggest
advance this year in August, the government said Monday, but the
gain was in government and non-residential building while the
single-family housing industry continued to sag.
   The Commerce Department said overall spending increased 1.8
percent last month, up $7.3 billion to a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of $421.8 billion, the first gain since May's 1.4 percent
advance.
   Analysts expect building construction to remain at the current
level for the remainder of the year as the economy continues to
grow at a modest pace.
   ``All signals point to not too much change from recent trends,''
economist Mark Obrinsky of the Federal National Mortgage
Association said. ``I don't think we're going to see a boom or a
bust in either residential or non-residential construction.''
   Analysts have been looking for a slight pickup in construction
spending ever since interest rates began falling earlier in the
year. Fixed-rate mortgage rates declined from a peak of 11.22
percent in March to 10.22 at the end of August and to 10.16 last
week, according to a survey by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Co.
   The Commerce Department said the August advance was the biggest
since a 2.3 percent increase last December and followed declines of
0.6 percent in July and 0.8 percent in June. The July figure had
been revised downward from a miniscule 0.02 percent gain.
   Government building, a volatile sector representing about 20
percent of construction spending, was up 5.3 percent in August, led
by a 4.2 percent rebound in highway building which had fallen 4.5
percent in July.
   ``That's a number which from time to time shows a big one-month
increase and quite often will come back to the previous trend-level
in the following months and I suspect we'll see that this time,''
Obrinsky said.
   Residential construction, which accounts for nearly half of
construction spending, posted a tiny fractional increase of 0.05
percent to an annual rate of $198.9 billion. But single-family
construction fell 0.2 percent to an annual rate of $113.1 billion
while apartment building gained 0.4 percent to $23.5 billion.
   Obrinsky said he expects the pace of housing starts to improve
in the fourth quarter, but at a modest pace.
   Non-residential construction was up 2.9 percent to an annual
rate of $100.3 billion, led by advances of 4.5 percent in office
buildings and 1.8 percent in factories.
   Total construction was up 3.4 percent from the level of building
a year ago.

<HEAD>Kaifu Promises Political Reform, Review of Sales Tax</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRIL JONES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu pledged Monday to
press ahead with political reform and a review of a widely
unpopular new sales tax in his first policy speech since taking
office in August.
   Kaifu addressed Parliament after the Liberal Democratic Party's
victory in a weekend election indicated the scandal-ridden party's
fortunes are improving. ``The restoration of trust in politics is
this Cabinet's most important task,'' he said. ``I am thus
determined to continue to make a good-faith effort to move ahead on
political reform.''
   On Sunday, Kaifu's party won a by-election to fill a vacancy in
Parliament's upper house after the death of a Liberal Democratic
lawmaker.
   As the first national-level election under the Kaifu
administration, it was closely watched. The opposition campaigned
mainly on pledges to work for abolition of the 3 percent sales tax,
which took effect in April and contributed to the Liberal
Democrats' loss of its upper house majority for the first time in
34 years in July elections.
   Kaifu said his party is reviewing the sales tax, which it rammed
through Parliament late last year, but he ruled out abolishing the
levy.
   ``The consumption tax is absolutely indispensable in light of
the need to equalize the tax burden and to meet Japan's future
needs,'' he said.
its weekday schedule from 74
flights a day to 48, said Robert Priddy, Air Midwest's chief
executive officer.
   Air Midwest, which operates as Braniff Express at the Kansas
City airport, said it would eliminate service between Kansas City
and seven Midwestern cities: Joplin, Mo.; Grand Island, Neb.; Sioux
City, Iowa; Waterloo, Iowa; Moline, Ill.; Peoria, Ill.; and
Madison, Wis.
   Robert C. Dynan, vice president of Braniff Express operations,
said most of the passengers on the canceled routes connected with
Braniff flights, meaning there now wasn't enough traffic to keep
flying to those cities.
   Priddy said the reduced Air Midwest schedule, which still would
serve 19 cities, could be maintained without feeding Braniff
flights.
   He said the cuts would force some layoffs of Air Midwest's 150
employees at Kansas City, although he did not know how many.
   ``It's an awfully sad thing, but I really don't have that much
choice at this point,'' Priddy said.
   Braniff, which is trying to reorganize as a smaller carrier,
said it would offer a total of 46 flights nationwide Monday serving
11 cities, and 40 of those flights would start or end at Kansas
City.
   The schedule is for two round-trip flights each to 10 cities
from Kansas City: Chicago; Dallas-Fort Worth; Los Angeles; Newark,
N.J.; New York City-LaGuardia; Orlando, Fla.; Phoenix, Ariz.; San
Diego; San Francisco; and Washington-National.
   Another three round-trip flights will run between Orlando, where
Braniff is based, and other cities.
   The schedule will use 12 Boeing 727-200s, each of which can
carry 169 passengers. None of Braniff's five new Airbus A320 jets
will be used.
   A federal bankruptcy judge ruled last week that an Irish
financial service company could suspend its contract to supply
Braniff with additional A320s.
   On Sunday, Braniff operated only four departures from Kansas
City. Because traffic was so low in Terminal A, several lounges and
snack bars were closed.

   Jim Robinson lived an uneventful life
on Atlantic City's beaches until he and another homeless man were
photographed sleeping in front of Miss America contestants in
swimsuits.
   The discovery three weeks ago of the men beneath an overturned
lifeguard boat interrupted a beach photo session for the beauty
queens. Police quickly herded Robinson and his companion from the
beach.
   Today, Robinson, 42, has a job, a roof over his head and money
in his pockets.
   His luck changed last week when he started a new job in the
mailroom at Penguin USA, a publishing company in Bergenfield.
   ``It's nice to work for a change,'' he said over a glass of iced
tea at a luncheonette near his job. ``I'm not making a lot of
money, but it's fine.''
   His homelessness started in early summer after he lost a job as
a security guard. Before that, Robinson was a taxi driver for seven
years in the seaside resort.
   Robinson had hit a low point by the time an Associated Press
photographer recorded the Sept. 9 episode just off the Atlantic
City boardwalk before the startled contestants. The photograph
appeared in newspapers nationwide, and it wasn't the kind of
publicity Robinson welcomed.
   ``I didn't want my friends to see it,'' he said.
   A day after the incident, Robinson's colleague, Jeff Hall, was
found dead on the beach.
   ``I was with him,'' Robinson said. ``I left him for 20 minutes
to bum a cigarette on the Boardwalk.''
   Police are investigating the death. Robinson said Hall died of
``something like a heart attack or a brain seizure.''
   ``It wasn't from being drunk,'' he said. ``Living that kind of
life will kill you.''
   Robinson said Hall's death inspired him to try to turn around
his own life. ``It made me a stronger person. It gave me something
to do for a cause,'' he said.
   Robinson blames his problems on drugs. He said he used cocaine
for about a year, during which he spent as much as $3,000 a week,
much of it from a $70,000 inheritance. He said he quit in February
1985 and went through several rehabilitation programs.
   But a depression that followed his rehabilitation led to a
suicide attempt in 1987, and Robinson was sent to Ancora
Psychiatric Hospital in Winslow Township for 10 months, he said.
   He was released to an Atlantic City halfway house in May 1988,
and moved out after getting a job as a security guard.
   He described the time he spent on the beach as ``a little
camping excursion.''
   ``I'm glad I went through it in a way,'' he said. ``We had some
good times. Hey, look at my tan,'' he said, rolling up a shirt
sleeve.
   A week after the beach episode, Robinson moved in with a cousin,
Joan Burke, and her husband, Raymond, of Bogota, N.J.
   ``We gave him the one shot,'' said Burke, a retired New York
City transit police officer. ``When he called us, I took that as an
indication that he wanted help. Eventually, we hope he'll be all
right.''
   Now that he's working again, Robinson said he would like to help
the homeless. He also is considering writing a book.
   ``There are bums that want to be bums,'' he said. ``You can't
help them people until they want to be helped. But there's a lot of
people that want help.''

   A teen-ager whose sister and father died
in separate car crashes four months ago was killed when a car and
tractor-trailer collided.
   Ronald Lee Pirl Jr., 17, of Connellsville was a passenger in the
car and died Sunday, officials said.
   Pirl's sister, 16-year-old Barbara Pirl, was killed in a
one-vehicle accident June 8.
   Ronald Lee Pirl Sr. was on his way to his daughter's funeral
when the pickup truck in which he was riding veered out of control
and overturned. Pirl, 38, was killed.
   Sunday night, the younger Pirl was in a car driven by Eugene
Miller, 19, of Champion when it spun out of control on a rain-slick
highway. State police said the car crossed the center line and
collided with the truck. Miller also was killed.
   Neither Miller nor Pirl was wearing a seat belt, said Trooper
Stanley Foss.
   The truck driver was not injured.

   The city's 5,000 civic employees went on
strike Monday because Liege, Belgium's third-largest city, has run
out of credit and cannot pay September salaries, officials said.
   Liege's creditor bank refused a new loan of $12.5 million after
the city council Sunday rejected an austerity plan that would have
required laying off 1,084 civic employees.
   Liege's debts total some $750 million, said city spokesman
Benoit Ralet.
   The austerity program was put together by the Socialist and
Christian Democrat parties that run the city, but it failed to win
enough votes in the city council.
   Opponents called the program too drastic, saying it would not
leave enough personnel for key services in this industrial city of
220,000.

   The conflict in Cambodia was the principal topic of
discussion Monday in Thai Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan's
meeting with Premier Michel Rocard, officials said.
   Rocard's office said Chatichai's visit was considered very
important because of the role Thailand plays in the Cambodian
situation and because of Bangkok's relations with China and its
place in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
   They provided no details of the discussions.
   Chatichai's visit comes days after the withdrawal of Vietnamese
troops from Cambodia.
   France was co-president of the international conference on
Cambodia, which failed to find a solution to the conflict in that
Southeast Asian nation.
   The Thai prime minister has launched a new initiative to attempt
to bring the warring Cambodian factions back to the conference
table.

   Hundreds of East Germans poured
into the West Germany Embassy today, hoping to join 7,000 others
who fled West during the weekend. East Germany demanded that West
Germany expel the new arrivals.
   East Germany filed an official protest with West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's chief of staff, Rudolf Seiters, demanding
that Bonn throw out those who have arrived since the dramatic
exodus during the weekend.
   East Germany's official ADN news agency said the nation's
permanent representative in Bonn, Horst Neubauer, complained to
Seiters that West Germany was reneging on an agreement by harboring
the newcomers.
   West German government urged East Berlin to allow the second
wave of East German refugees to also emigrate to the West. West
German officials have said there were no strings attached to the
earlier transfer.
   Neubauer, according to ADN, told Seiters that it was East
Germany's decision to let the earlier group of refugees leave on
humanitarian grounds because the embassy compounds had become
unhealthy due to overcrowding.
   Neubauer accused West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher of falsely taking credit for the resolution of the refugee
standoff.
   Despite roadblocks in the area and strict identity checks,
between 500 and 600 East Germans have made their way inside the
compound here, refugees reported. About 100 new refugees were at
the embassy in Warsaw.
   Czech police patrolled the area with dogs during the night, and
some refugees said police had resorted to violence to stem the flow
of East Germans. One woman said police had dragged and kicked her
family.
   A diplomat from the mission hurried out to rescue one man who
clung to the embassy fence as policemen tried to drag him away. The
diplomat put his arm around the East German, and police allowed him
to lead the man inside. Police then freed another refugee, who had
been handcuffed to a park bench nearby.
   East German agreed to the refugee transfer on Saturday and
thousands of East Germans from Prague and Warsaw departed on
Sunday. As they left, however, hundreds of other East Germans
trying to get West convered on the embassies, hoping they too would
be granted safe passage to West Germany.
   East Germany had harsh words for those who emigrated West during
the weekend.
   ``With their behavior they have trampled on moral values and
excluded themselves from our society. No one should cry any tears
for them,'' said a government statement issued late Sunday by the
state ADN news agency.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We
are pleased that these refugees are being allowed access to the
West. ... It looks like the officials there are taking a
responsible approach in trying to help these people get to the
West.''
   In mid-September, East Germany's Communist leaders registered
fierce protests when Hungary's liberal leaders opened their border
to the West and thousands of East Germans fled.
   The exodus through Hungary continued overnight. Border
authorities in Bavaria reported 1,051 new arrivals by early today.
In all, about 2,000 refugees fled through Hungary during the
weekend, officials said.
   West German government spokesmen disclosed that Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze played an important role in winning
the refugees' release from Prague and Warsaw during the weekend,
and said Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has been in touch
with Bonn by telephone throughout the continuing refugee saga.
   Gorbachev is expected in East Berlin to help commemorate 40
years of Communist rule in a country that has already lost more
than 100,000 people to the westward exodus this year.
   The Soviet Comunist Party daily Pravda today devoted almost all
of its fifth page to feting the East German anniversary and said
not a word about the refugee exodus.
   About 7,000 East German refugees, many weeping with joy, pulled
into West German train stations early Sunday after East Berlin
agreed to let them emigrate.
   Some said they jumped aboard the freedom trains as they passed
through East Germany, which agreed to the exodus on condition the
refugees travel via their homeland. That allowed East Berlin to say
the refugees were being ``expelled.''
   The latest arrivals in West Germany follow more than 26,000 East
Germans who have fled through Hungary since Sept. 10, when Budapest
broke ranks with the rest of the East bloc and opened its border
with Austria.
   The extraordinary accord permitting the latest refugees to go to
the West followed discussions involving East and West Germany,
Czechoslovakia, Poland, the United States, the Soviet Union and
France. It underscored dramatic changes in the Soviet bloc and
growing divisions among its member states.
   East Germany, under 77-year-old leader Erich Honecker, has been
an outspoken opponent of the reforms advocated by Gorbachev.
   Many of those arriving Sunday aboard packed trains in the
northern Bavarian city of Hof had tears streaming down their faces.
Others cheered and clapped wildly.
   ``We had no future there,'' 34-year-old Uwe Kuester of Cottbus
said of his Communist homeland.
   Well-wishers handed out bottles of wine, champagne and fruit as
the newcomers disembarked.
   West German law automatically grants East Germans citizenship on
arrival.

   A blind, aspiring minister who for nine years
has sought financial aid from Washington state so he can attend
Bible college lost a Supreme Court appeal today.
   The court, without comment, let stand the state's refusal to
subsidize vocational training for Larry Witters. He argued that the
refusal violates his religious freedom.
   The justices in 1986 ruled unanimously that the state's
providing Witters with financial aid would not violate the
constitutionally required separation of church and state.
   The 1986 decision overturned a Washington Supreme Court ruling
that had said giving Witters money under a state
vocational-training program for the blind would promote religion
impermissibly.
   Witters' case then returned to the state Supreme Court, which
last April 20 ruled, by a 5-4 vote, that letting Witters receive
the state funding would violate a state constitution ban.
   A provision of Washington's constitution says, ``No public money
... shall be appropriated for or applied to any religious ...
instruction.''
   In the appeal acted on today, Witters argued that the state
constitution's provision violates his religious freedom protected
by the federal Constitution's First Amendment.
   His case crystalizes the inherent tension between two First
Amendment clauses _ one banning official ``establishment'' of
religion and one banning official interference with ``the free
exercise'' of religion.
   Witters, who is legally blind, was first denied aid in 1980. As
a result, he was forced to drop out of the Inland Empire School of
the Bible in Spokane and take a dish-washing job in a medical
laboratory.
   His appeal said Washington had excluded Witters ``from receiving
the benefits of public welfare legislation because of his faith.''
   The appeal likened the state's treatment of Witters to an
attempt by Missouri to ban religious clubs from meeting on state
college campuses and Tennessee's attempt to bar ministers from
holding elective office.
   The nation's highest court struck down both of those state
attempts as unconstitutional infringements of religious rights.
   In urging the justices to reject Witters' appeal, Washington
Attorney General Kenneth Eikenberry argued, ``The problem with what
(Witters) wants arises from the type of instruction which he wishes
the state to fund, not from his career goal or from the institution
he wishes to attend.''
   Eikenberry said Witters would be eligible for state funding if
he took non-religious courses, even at the Bible school.
   The case is Witters vs. Washington Department of Services for
the Blind, 89-94.

<HEAD>Rafsanjani Calls On Afghan Rebels To Unite</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran
called on fractious Afghan rebel groups Monday to unite to form an
Islamic government in Kabul and to reject U.S. support.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia,
also quoted Rafsanjani as calling for an end to superpower
intervention in Afghanistan, where U.S.-backed Moslem rebels have
been fighting 11 years to oust the Soviet-backed government.
   Opening an international seminar on the Afghan issue, the
president urged all Afghan groups to cooperate in their fight for
self-determination and ``to isolate ideologies alien to Afghan
culture and tradition.''
   The seven-group guerrilla alliance is based in Pakistan.
   The Sunni Moslem alliance has been at odds with another
guerrilla coalition of Shiite Moslems based in Iran, which is
overwhelmingly Shiite.
   IRNA quoted Rafsanjani as saying only Islam could guarantee
Afghanistan's territorial integrity and independence.
   ``We are for an independent, Islamic and non-aligned
Afghanistan,'' he declared.
   Iran has been taking a growing role in efforts to form an
interim government dominated by the guerrillas, known as
mujahedeen, following the Soviet military withdrawal from
Afghanistan in February.
   The Iranian effort has developed as Tehran's relations with
Moscow have improved, in large part because of the Soviet
withdrawal.
   The Soviets regularly consult the Iranians on developments in
Afghanistan, Iran's northeastern neighbor.
   Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati told delegates to
the Tehran conference that recognizing Washington's role in
Afghanistan contradicted the interests of Afghanistan's Moslem
people, IRNA reported.
   ``The future of Afghanistan does not depend on a certain person
or group, but rather on the Afghan nation which has suffered a
great deal and should decide the country's fate,'' he added.
   That was an apparent reference to the split in guerrilla ranks.

<HEAD>Texas Supreme Court Finds School Finance System Unconstitutional</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Rewrites throughout to UPDATE with comment from school administrator

efficiency referred to schools, not government in general; add background

<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Texas Supreme Court ruled unanimously
today that the state's public school finance system is
unconstitutional and gave lawmakers until May to come up with a
solution.
   The nine-member court, however, said it would not instruct the
legislature what specific steps to take to correct the problem.
   A state district judge had held the school finance system
unconstitutional in a case brought by poor school districts, many
of them largely Hispanic, against the state education commissioner
and others.
   That ruling was overturned last December by a 2-1 vote of the
Austin-based 3rd Court of Appeals, but the high court upheld the
plaintiffs today on the grounds that the constitution required an
``efficient'' education system.
   ``We hold that the state's school financing system is neither
financially efficient, nor efficient in the sense of providing for
a `general diffusion of knowledge' statewide,'' Justice Oscar
Mauzy's opinion said.
   With an enrollment of 3.3 million, Texas has the second-largest
public school system in the country after California.
   Texas school districts with relatively low property values
brought the suit in 1984. As in most states, public schools in
Texas are funded largely through a combination of local property
taxes and state aid. Similar financing systems have been challenged
in court in at least 10 other states.
   The case is known as Edgewood vs. Kirby, from the lead
plaintiff, Edgewood Independent School District in San Antonio, and
lead defendant, William F. Kirby, commissioner of the Texas
Education Agency.
   ``I'm still, I think, about 20,000 feet over San Antonio,''
Edgewood Superintendent James Vasquez said after learning of the
ruling.
   ``It's the end of a five-year struggle for me, personally, but
it's the end of a 20-year struggle for the school district,'' he
said.
   Kirby was out of town to give a speech and could not immediately
be reached for comment.
   In its ruling, the court rejected arguments that reform in
school finance will eliminate local control, saying an efficient
system does not mean an end to local control, ``only that the funds
available for education be distributed equitably and evenly.''
   Mauzy's opinion said because the court had decided that the
finance system violated the constitution's efficiency requirement,
it need not consider petitioners' other constitutional challenges
such as the argument that the present system is discriminatory.
   Mauzy's opinion said the court would give the legislature until
May 1, 1990, to come up with a remedy, because the court wanted to
avoid ``any sudden disruption in the educational processes.''
   ``Let there be no misunderstanding,'' the opinion said. ``A
remedy is long overdue. The legislature must take immediate
action.''
   The legislature meets in special session Nov. 14. There was no
immediate response from Gov. Bill Clements on whether he would put
school financing on the agenda in the wake of the court's decision.
   In the Legislature's regular session this spring, lawmakers
approved five education bills, including a plan to pump $450
million in extra state aid to help equalize funding and provide a
pay raise for teachers.
   But many of the poor districts complained the extra money was
not nearly enough and many cities have been forced to raise
property taxes to pay for state-mandated education reforms.
   In 1988, Comptroller Bob Bullock found that 730 of the state's
1,100 school districts spend less than the statewide average of
$3,290 per student per year.
   The average in those districts was $2,976. In the wealthier
districts, the average yearly expenditure was $4,268.
   John T. Garcia, state director of the League of United Latin
American Citizens, the Hispanic civil rights organization, called
the decision long overdue and ``a very bold step for the Supreme
Court.''
   Texas is one of 11 states whose school financing systems have
been challenged in court on the grounds of equity. In June, for
example, the Kentucky Supreme Court ordered that state's
Legislature to reorganize the state's public education programs.
   Other states with active lawsuits or court orders concerning
school finance are Alaska, Connecticut, Indiana, Minnesota,
Montana, New Jersey, North Dakota, Oregon and Tennessee. A
coalition of poor Alabama districts says it will probably sue that
state this fall.

<HEAD>31 Killed Despite Government Cease-fire</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirty-one people died in the
bloodiest 24-hour period since the government declared a unilateral
cease-fire last week, military officials reported Monday.
   Twenty-four people were murdered by Sinhalese radicals, six were
killed by soldiers they had ambushed, and a jailed Sinhalese
extremist committed suicide, the officials said.
   A soldier and a child were wounded in the ambush Sunday at
Girikola village, 25 miles south of Colombo, said the officials,
whose names cannot be used under briefing rules.
   The deaths brought the total to 59 since the government
proclaimed the cease-fire Wednesday. It originally was called for
three days, then extended until 6 a.m. Tuesday.
   President Ranasinghe Premadasa instructed the military to halt
operations against members of the People's Liberation Front, a
Sinhalese radical group, but said they were allowed to defend
themselves.
   He declared the truce to give the radicals among the Sinhalese,
Sri Lanka's predominant ethnic group, an opportunity to end their
2-year-old uprising and join peace talks. At least 5,000 people
have been killed in the violence.
   The People's Liberation Front rejected negotiations and
continued its campaign of killings and arson, but the government
said 869 extremists had surrendered during the cease-fire.
   Military officials said the 24 people killed by Sinhalese
radicals included two soldiers whose vehicle was blown up. They
said the other victims were police informants, members of
policemen's families or supporters of the government.
   At least 14 post offices, 17 government buildings and three
buses were burned, the officials reported.
   Violence increased after Premadasa took office in January, after
elections the extremists claimed were fraudulent.
   They oppose the 1987 peace accord with ethnic Tamil separatists
and the presence of Indian soldiers assigned to supervise the peace
plan. India has said it will withdraw its troops by Dec. 31.
   About 11,000 people have been killed in the Tamil war, which
began in 1983.
   Tamils, predominantly Hindu, make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's
16 million people and claim discrimination by the Sinhalese, most
of whom are Buddhists.
   India became involved because it is the regional power and has a
Tamil population of 60 million. Most live in Tamil Nadu state, just
across the Palk Strait from Sri Lanka.

<TEXT>
   In a major policy reversal, the opposition Labor
Party dropped its once-cherished policy of unilateral nuclear
disarmament.
   At its annual conference, the socialist movement voted to adopt
a new platform that would commit a Labor government to scrapping
Britain's nuclear weapons only in a negotiated arms deal.
   Ditching the non-nuclear doctrine, which had been a factor in
Labor's successive defeats by Conservative Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher since losing power in 1979, is part of a major policy
overhaul.
   Anti-nuclear activists had accused the party of betraying its
principles.
   ``Britain does not need nuclear weapons; there is no Soviet
nuclear threat,'' declared Tony Benn, a former Cabinet minister and
veteran left-wing Labor legislator, during a sometimes impassioned
debate.
   The delegates voted by 3.6 million to 2.4 million for the new
policy, after moderate trade union leaders swung the huge votes of
their entire memberships behind party leader Neil Kinnock.
   Votes are counted in millions at Labor conferences because of
the block vote system.
   Labor leader Neil Kinnock, his party leading the Conservatives
in opinion polls for the past four months, had secured support from
most of the trade union leaders who control 90 percent of the
voting power at the party's conferences.
   Polls published Sunday showed Labor between five and 12
percentage points ahead of the Conservatives.
   Under the new policy, Labor would retain Britain's
submarine-launched Polaris nuclear missiles and also drop its
previous pledge to shut down U.S. nuclear bases.
   The policy also calls for a Labor-led government to stick with
Mrs. Thatcher's decision to replace Polaris in the early 1990s with
the far more powerful U.S. Trident missile system.
   Party moderates have long said the non-nuclear policy, adopted
in 1981, invited electoral defeat.
   But 47-year-old Kinnock, a committed unilateralist since his
student days, held out until after Mrs. Thatcher won a third
successive five-year term in 1987.
   Party leaders now argue that the strides in superpower arms
control negotiations mean Labor is dropping a redundant policy
rather than betraying a cherished ideal.

<TEXT>
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said today
after a meeting with President Bush that a ``golden opportunity''
exists for an eventual settlement of the conflict between Israel
and the Palestinian Arabs.
   After meeting with Bush for almost an hour, Mubarak told
reporters the essential next step in the peace process is to
convince the Israelis and the Palestinians to enter into a dialogue
without preconditions.
   Asserting that he believes a comprehensive settlement is
possible eventually, Mubarak said, ``It would be a grave mistake to
miss the golden opportunity existing today. A continuation of the
status quo is hazardous to both parties.''
   Mubarak met with Bush against a background of U.S. efforts to
persuade a reluctant Israel to open discussions with Palestinians
based on proposals set forth by the Egyptian leader.
   U.S. officials regard the 10-point Egyptian plan as a complement
to the proposal by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir for
elections in which Palestinians would select representatives to
negotiate with Israel on limited self-government in the occupied
territories.
   After the Oval Office meeting, Mubarak was off to the State
Department for lunch with Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
Mubarak addressed the U.N. General Assembly on Friday and arrived
in Washington on Sunday. His visit is officially listed as private.
   Shortly before leaving for the State Department, Baker
reaffirmed to reporters his backing for Mubarak's initiative,
calling it a way to get an Israeli-Palestinian dialogue that would,
in turn, pave the way for Palestinian elections.
   ``We won't get to peace until Palestinians and Israelis speak to
each other,'' Baker said.
   As photographers snapped pictures at the outset of the meeting,
Bush was asking the Egyptian leader, ``Did you get any squash in?''
   ``I didn't find time to. I didn't find any place,'' replied
Mubarak, an avid squash player.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater today declined comment on
an Egyptian newspaper report that the Bush administration had
proposed a joint Egyptian-Israeli committee to pave the way for
elections in the territories.
   Fitzwater said it would be ``inappropriate to comment'' on the
Al Akhbar report. ``We have discussed any number of ways to
facilitate that kind of discussion, but there have been no specific
proposals,'' he said.
   A key element of Mubarak's proposal is the convening of talks
between Israelis and Palestinians in Cairo. But Shamir said last
week he is worried that the Palestinians may be more interested in
Israel's surrender than in a peaceful settlement.
   Shamir also objects to Mubarak's suggestion that voting rights
be extended to Arabs living in East Jerusalem and to Palestinians
who live outside the occupied territories.
   Shamir has rejected Mubarak's suggestion that the outcome of any
negotiations be self-determination for the Palestinians.
   The Arab-Israeli conflict was a dominant issue for Baker during
his talks last week at the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
   Baker holds the view that Mubarak's plan and Shamir's election
proposal are not mutually exclusive and that Shamir therefore
should not use his objections as a basis for scuttling the peace
process.
   Mubarak's proposal stops short of demanding the establishment of
a Palestinian state, and it contains other features which have
attracted favorable comment from Israel's Labor Party.
   The plan has caused a deep split between Labor and Shamir's
Likud Party, threatening the governing coalition between the two
that has existed for 10 months.
   On Sunday, Israeli soldiers shot and killed four Palestinians in
clashes in the occupied lands and Arab activists stabbed to death a
man they accused of collaborating with Israel, the army and Arab
hospitals said.
   In the Gaza Strip, Moslem fundamentalists issued a new leaflet
calling on Palestinians to escalate their 21-month-old uprising and
to ``continue to kill collaborators.''

<TEXT>
   Zsa Zsa Gabor, former Hungarian beauty queen
and convicted cop-slapper, said today the court should turn the
other cheek and spare her jail time because it would be ``silly''
to punish her like that when she did nothing wrong.
   The unrepentant Miss Gabor said, however, that she is prepared
to turn in her glamorous garb for prison drab, according to an
interview from her Bel-Air home with ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
   ``Nothing in the world can scare me, I tell you, my darling,''
said the sometime actress in her trademark Hungarian accent.
   Miss Gabor, who appeared in such films as ``Moulin Rouge'' and
``Picture Mommy Dead'' was convicted Friday of slapping a Beverly
Hills police officer Paul Kramer during a traffic stop, of driving
without a valid driver's license and of having an open container of
alcohol in her car.
   Miss Gabor was acquitted of disobeying Kramer by driving away as
he checked her motor vehicle record on June 14. She faces up to 18
months, five days in jail and a $3,500 fine at her Oct. 17
sentencing.
   ``What did I do that was so wrong?'' Miss Gabor said today,
repeating the points she raised at her trial. ``I protected myself
from a 6-foot-4 man who called me every name in the world and who
treated me like ... a streetwalker. I should go for that to jail? I
think that would be really _ that would be silly.''

<TEXT>
   Teachers in this financially
strapped city went out on strike today after rejecting a salary
offer that would have left many ``taking home less pay than last
year,'' a union official said.
   Union members were setting up pickets at all 36 schools in the
district, said Terry Turley, president of the East St. Louis
Federation of Teachers Local 1220.
   Samuel Morgan, principal at East St. Louis Senior High School,
said classes were canceled for the district's 16,000 students. Most
of the staff members at his school were picketing, Morgan said, and
members of other unions, such as the custodians, were honoring the
picket lines.
   The East St. Louis Board of Education had proposed binding
arbitration to settle disputes over wage increases and insurance
payments. The district, which has a $12.5 million debt, is trying
to get the teachers to pay a larger share of health insurance costs.
   Turley said union members met Sunday and voted 347-227 to reject
binding arbitration, effectively voting to strike in the
fourth-largest school district in the state. The 1,200 teachers,
teachers' aides, clerks and attendance officers represented by the
union had been working without a contract since school started Aug.
28, Turley said.
   Turley declined to disclose the terms of the board's final
offer, but said rising insurance costs would have offset pay
increases for some teachers. Last year, the teachers were under a
wage freeze.
   Last week, State Superintendent of Education C. Robert Leininger
said the district stands to lose $60 million in state funds for
failing to implement an emergency debt-reduction plan.
   The plan called for firing 250 teachers, shifting the cost of
dependent health care coverage to employees and closing or
consolidating four schools to save $11 million by the end of this
year.

<HEAD>Court Asks Administration for Views on Gas Consumers Suits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today asked the Bush
administration for its views on broadening the power of states to
sue in behalf of gas consumers allegedly overcharged by utility
companies.
   The court said it wants to hear from Justice Department lawyers
before acting on an appeal by Kansas and Missouri officials who
have accused utilities of illegal price-fixing.
   The Justice Department's response may take months.
   The appeal was supported by 32 other states seeking to protect
their consumers and vigorously enforce antitrust laws.
   Kansas and Missouri officials sued the Kansas Power &amp; Light Co.
and Utilicorp United Inc. over natural gas transported by pipeline
from Wyoming and used to generate electricity sold to customers in
the two states.
   Some of the natural gas delivered from Wyoming was sold to the
utilities' customers.
   The states alleged that gas-producing companies conspired to
inflate the price of the gas, and that the utilities passed on the
higher rates to consumers.
   The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in January that the
states do not have the authority to sue in behalf of residential
customers.
   The appeals court said that only direct purchasers of fixed
amounts of gas may sue in such cases.
   ``Any allocation of illegal overcharges to the residential
consumers may require tracing the sale from the wellhead through
each level of distribution to establish the amount of illegal gas
costs actually paid ... adding new dimensions of complexity to
antitrust suits,'' the appeals court said.
   ``Residential indirect purchasers of natural gas are not
entitled to sue the alleged violators,'' the appeals court said.
   Kansas and Missouri officials said the ruling conflicts with
that of the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which permitted such
suits. The states urged the Supreme Court to resolve the conflict.
   The 10th Circuit court has jurisdiction over lawsuits in
Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Kansas and Oklahoma.
   The states that supported the Kansas-Missouri appeal are Alaska,
Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Hawaii,
Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland,
Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New
Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota,
Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and
Wisconsin.
   The case is Kansas vs. Kansas Power &amp; Light, 88-2109.

<HEAD>Court To Decide Bar Association Dues Issue in California Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether attorneys may withhold their state bar association dues if
the association uses the money to campaign for various causes and
issues.
   The justices said they will hear arguments by 21 California
lawyers who say their free-speech rights are being violated because
they are forced to pay dues to the bar group in order to continue
practicing law in the state.
   The attorneys said the money is being used to promote numerous
ideological causes, including a nuclear weapons freeze and handgun
control, that they do not support.
   The California Supreme Court ruled in February that the lawyers'
rights were not violated, except if money is used by the bar
association to help finance campaigns of candidates for public
office.
   ``We conclude that the state bar may use dues to finance any
activity, except election campaigning, which is germane to its
statutory mission to promote the improvement of the administration
of justice,'' the state court said.
   The ruling conflicts with decisions by other state courts that
limit the power of state bar associations to use members' dues for
ideological purposes.
   The California court said the bar association, with power to
license and discipline lawyers, is more like a state agency than a
labor union.
   The U.S. Supreme Court has limited the power of unions to spend
dues money for public-issue lobbying.
   The California court noted that every lawyer in the state must
be a member of the bar to practice law there.
   Also, the state court said, the bar association is run by a
governing board that includes six of 22 members appointed by the
governor with approval of the state Senate.
   ``The California Constitution, statutes and judicial decisions
... appear to envision the bar as a governmental agency,'' the
state court said.
   Therefore, the state court continued, the bar association may
use its revenues ``for any purposes within its authority.''
   Issues of public health, safety and welfare fall within that
category, the state court said.
   But the state court said the bar association went too far in
1982 when it distributed material supporting justices of the state
Supreme Court who were up for re-election.
   The material permissibly supported the independence of the
judiciary, the state court said. But ``its primary purpose, we
believe, was to assist in the election campaign on behalf of the
justices.'' That exceeded the association's authority, the state
court added.
   The case is Keller vs. State Bar of California, 88-1905.

   After 40 years of living together,
Axel and Eigil Axgil spent a happy first day as a ``married
couple'' Monday.
   Axel, 74, and Eigil, 67, were among the first 11 male couples to
exchange vows Sunday as Denmark became the first country to give
homosexual couples legal status and the right to join in a
``registered partnership.''
   Hundreds of homosexuals applauded, waved flags and threw rice on
them on the Town Hall steps, while Christian fundamentalists
demonstrated on the other side of the square. One demonstrator
waving a Bible called it ``Sodom's Day.''
   ``Homosexuality is a sin,'' he said.
   Parliament in May approved a gay rights bill by a lopsided
majority. Only the small People's Christian party opposed the
measure.
   The law, which took effect Sunday, gives homosexual couples
nearly equal rights as heterosexual couples but bars them from
adopting children. They have the same inheritance rights, tax
advantages and the right to share a last name.
   Under the new law, at least one partner must have Danish
citizenship and live in Denmark.
   Like the other 10 couples, Axel and Eigil solemnly answered
``yes'' to deputy mayor Tom Ahlberg when he asked if they consented
to tie each other in ``a registered partnership.'' They combined
their first names to form a common last name.
   ``We decided to get officially `married' because we have the
same feelings for each other as heterosexual couples,'' said Axel,
speaking on Danish television. He and Eigil later left town for
several days, friends said, apparently on a honeymoon.
   No lesbian couples have been registered. ``We don't like to be
in the front line,'' one woman said after Sunday's ceremony.
   ``The next step will be the acquisition of the right to adopt
stepchildren from one of the partners from an earlier heterosexual
marriage and the right to be blessed in a church,'' said Ivan
Larsen, who was among the couples and is a pastor of the Danish
Evangelist Lutheran Church.
   ``If I had the right to marry a homosexual couple in my church,
I would certainly like to do so, but for the time being we'll have
to wait,'' Larsen said.
   ``When it (the partnership) becomes official, it lasts longer,''
said Larsen's partner, school psychologist Ove Carlsen, who moved
into the church parsonage two years ago.

   The fate of Medicare catastrophic health care
coverage for 33 million Americans hangs in the balance as Congress
considers repealing the program to cool the ``blast furnace heat''
of angry senior citizens.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley today chided the Bush
administration for its silence on the program, which could be voted
on this week, and added: ``I'm told the president opposes the
repeal but I haven't seen any evidence of it.''
   Foley, D-Wash., supports a continuation of the program and said
President Bush's refusal to take a more vocal stand on the issue
puts Congress in ``an awkward position.'' Votes also may occur this
week in the Senate.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said today, ``Our
position basically is that we want to retain the benefits and
mitigate the premium costs.'' But the administration has not yet
endorsed or rejected any of the major alternatives the House is
expected to consider, he added.
   The program's defenders have launched a last-ditch effort to
save it by pushing a revision that would scrap major features of
the program, cancel the unpopular surtax that helps finance it, and
retain new prescription drug benefits scheduled to begin in January.
   ``We're on the heart-lung machine trying to keep the program
going,'' said John Rother, legislative director of the American
Association for Retired Persons. ``But it's obvious that some major
changes are going to have to be made.''
   The Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act is aimed at providing
protection for the elderly and disabled against financial ruin in
the event of a prolonged hospital stay or other high medical costs.
   The plan limits the amount that beneficiaries must pay for
hospital care, physician services, medical supplies and
prescription drugs and expands other health care benefits as well.
   For example, the program pays for unlimited approved
hospitalization after a once-a-year deductible of $560 in 1989.
Previously, Medicare charged a deductible for each hospital stay
during a year and provided full payment of hospital bills for 59
days a year.
   The program was enacted with support from major senior citizen
groups such as AARP but drew swift and strong criticism from many
older Americans who were angry at the costs for mandatory coverage
that some said they neither wanted nor needed.
   Many elderly people said they already had duplicate coverage
from private insurers and that the new program doesn't address
their chief concern with the high cost of long-term care in nursing
homes. Higher-income retirees also objected to paying a high
proportion of the program's costs.
   The focal point of the opposition is a surtax levied on the 40
percent of retirees whose incomes are high enough that they pay
more than $150 in income tax. The surtax _ 15 percent of their
income tax liabilities _ this year is capped at $800 per Medicare
enrollee but rises in future years.
   ``A lot of people don't have that extra money in their
budgets,'' said Alicia Hasek, a Florida retiree who joined a
grassroots group called Seniors Opposed to the Surtax. ``The best
thing is to go back to point one and start over again.''
   The opposition has members of Congress on the run _ literally.
Democratic Rep. Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, the 6-foot-4 chairman
of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, was booed and
chased down a Chicago street by a group of senior citizens last
month after he refused to discuss the catastrophic package with
them.
   ``These people don't understand what the government is trying to
do for them,'' Rostenkowski said as he hurried to outpace his
critics.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater earlier this month said
the protests had reached ``tidal wave'' proportions but that the
Bush administration still hopes to see the program preserved.
   Many proponents of the package maintain that most seniors
support the catastrophic package and that it is a vocal and
affluent minority making much of the noise.
   Eric Shulman, legislative director of the National Council of
Senior Citizens, said that while the opposition has hit Washington
with ``blast furnace heat,'' legislators and seniors will come to
regret it if they repeal important health care benefits.
   ``Over time, seniors would look back and say, `We really could
have used that benefit,'' he predicted.
   House action on the catastrophic package is expected this week
as the chamber works through an omnibus budget bill laden with a
host of unrelated items. Legislators will have the chance to vote
on proposals both to repeal and scale back the program.
   As an alternative to repeal, Democratic House leaders are
pushing a plan that would eliminate the surtax and strip out new
hospital, doctor and nursing home benefits. The remaining benefits
would be financed by keeping the existing flat fee of $4 a month
paid by all but the poorest Medicare beneficiaries.
   Left intact would be new prescription drug benefits and modest
expansions of coverage for home health care, hospice benefits and
in-home respite care. Also kept would be a requirement that
Medicaid pay the Medicare deductibles, premiums and copayments for
the poorest seniors.
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., is pushing a plan that would scrap
the surtax, retain the new hospitalization benefits, kill the drug
benefit and remove the cap on doctor payments. Other senators are
likely to push competing plans to repeal or revise the catastrophic
program.

   Czechoslovak writer Vaclav Havel on
Monday was named winner of the $16,000 Olof Palme Prize for public
service.
   Havel, Czechoslovakia's most prominent human rights activist,
was cited for ``his consistent and brave efforts for truth and
democracy,'' said Foreign Minister Sten Andersson, president of the
Olof Palme Memorial Foundation.
   Havel, a playwright, was jailed for four months this year.
   ``Havel is today a uniting figure in the struggle for human
rights _ not only in his own country. In spite of his beliefs,
which resulted in repeated jail terms, his humanistic view on life
is unbroken, and through his literary work he is an inspiration to
us all,'' Andersson said.
   Havel was invited to receive the prize in Stockholm in November,
a statement said.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar was given the
award last year and black South African labor leader Cyril
Ramaphosa received it in 1987.
   The prize was created three days after Palme, the Swedish prime
minister, was assassinated on a street in Stockholm on Feb. 28,
1986.
   Christer Pettersson was sentenced to life imprisonment for the
murder earlier this year. His appeal is being heard in a higher
court.

power to keep some accused criminals behind bars while they await
trial.
   The court said it will review a ruling in a New Mexico case that
forces the government to free, on bail, some defendants deemed to
be dangerous or a risk to flee before trial.
   The case is U.S. vs. Montalvo-Murillo, 89-163.
   
   TRESPASSING
   
   The court turned aside an appeal by three people convicted of
trespassing for handing out anti-abortion booklets to students
outside a Texas high school.

   EVANGELICAL GROUP
   
   The court turned aside an appeal by an evangelical Christian
group ordered to return most of the $6.5 million donated by a

ruling in a Maryland case that no such right to sue exists.
   The case is Milburn vs. Anne Arundel County Department of Social
Services, 89-96.
   
   MAFIA APPEALS
   
   The court turned aside appeals by eight Mafia figures from New
York City convicted in the 1979 killings of crime chieftain Carmine
Galante and two of his associates.
   The court, without comment, let stand the federal racketeering
convictions of family bosses Anthony Salerno, Anthony Corallo and
Carmine Persico, high-ranking mobsters Salvatore Santoro,
Christopher Furnari and Gennaro Langella, and mob members Anthony
Indelicato and Ralph Scopo.
   The cases are Indelicato vs. U.S., 88-1881; Salerno vs. U.S.,
88-2060; Persico vs. U.S., 88-2061; Scopo vs. U.S., 88-2071.

policy.
   The case is ALPA vs. Delta, 88-1901.
   
   AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE
   
   The court let states require automobile insurance for motorists
who say it violates their religious convictions.

   GENERAL MOTORS SUIT
   
   The court let stand a $1.2 million bonus in fees awarded to the
lawyers of consumers who sued over allegedly defective

in which there was a substantial risk of non-payment because of a
loss.
   The case is GM vs. Skelton, 88-1848.
   
   BANKRUPTCY
   
   The court said it will consider placing new limits on the

says sexually explicit photographs and caricatures in Hustler
magazine libeled her and invaded her privacy.

lawsuit by feminist author Andrea Dworkin.
   The case is Dworkin vs. Hustler, 88-1900.
   
   GRAND JURY WITNESSES
   
   The court agreed to decide whether states may prohibit grand
jury witnesses from making public their own testimony once the
investigation has ended.
   The justices said they will review an attempt by Florida
officials to block a former newspaper reporter from disclosing
details of his appearance before a grand jury three years ago.
   A federal appeals court said a state law barring such public
disclosure violates free-speech rights.
   The case is Butterworth vs. Smith, 88-1993.
   
   MEDICAID
   
   The court agreed to decide whether hospitals and nursing care
homes may sue in federal court to challenge how a state-run

of a disability annuity for a California man who was given
incorrect information about benefits eligibility.
   The case is Office of Personnel Mangement vs. Richmond, 88-1943.
   
   BLACK LUNG

unfairly makes it too difficult for coal miners who contract
``black lung'' disease to obtain a lawyer's help when seeking
benefits.

of Appeals ruling that the system for awarding lawyer fees in black
lung benefits cases violates due-process rights.
   The case is Labor Department vs. Triplett, 88-1671.

   The town council president remained
hopeful Monday that her golden retriever will be returned, two
months after it disappeared in a possible political extortion
attempt.
   The 7-year-old dog, Kelly, failed to return home July 31 from a
nightly romp on Sandra Johanson's 64-acre estate. Twelve hours
later, Mrs. Johanson received an anonymous telephone call from a
man who said: ``Get off the council and you'll get your dog.''
   Mrs. Johanson said she is confident the dog is alive. And she
vowed to remain in office.
   George Weeden, chief of the town's 10-member police force, said
Monday he has no new leads. Several people were interviewed, and at
least one was given a lie-detector test, but no arrests had been
made.
   Some residents of this rural town of 7,000 people, about 45
miles south of Providence, have speculated the dog's disappearance
could be related to the November firings of the town dump custodian
and the highway supervisor. The highway official was reinstated,
then resigned.

   Entertainer Bill Cosby used the ``tough
love'' approach with his 23-year-old daughter, Erinn, when she told
him that she was addicted to drugs and alcohol, both father and
daughter say.
   Erinn Cosby, who checked out of a drug rehabilitation center
Sept. 24, said she began using cocaine at age 19, but that her
parents had no idea se had a drug habit until she wrote them a
letter six months ago. She said she had kicked a $200-a-day cocaine
habit by then but was still heavily hooked on pot and alcohol.
   Cosby, who plays a father-knows-best-style dad on his hit
television series and wrote a best-seller ``Fatherhood'' about his
experiences with his five children, said he consulted specialists
on how to handle the situation and he and his wife wrote back
urging her to seek treatment. But they refused to coddle her.
   ```Tough love' is the only way of dealing with this. We love her
and want her to get better, but we have to take a very firm, very
tough stand that forces her to realize that no one can fix things
for her,'' the star told the National Enquirer. ``She has to beat
this on her own.''
   ``People see Bill Cosby as a super dad. But I'm proof that drug
and alcohol tragedies can happen even in the most loving
families,'' said his daughter, who is staying with a cousin in
Boston after her five-week stay at Edgehill Newport hospital in
Rhode Island.
   David Brokaw, Cosby's Los Angeles-based spokesman, confirmed
today that Ms. Cosby is under treatment for a drug and alcohol
problem, and said Cosby would have no further comment other than
what he had told the Enquirer.
   The Enquirer piece is ``the only interview that he's been
willing to give on the matter,'' Brokaw said. ``He has a
relationship with them. He has found them to treat him fairly.''
   He said he couldn't confirm any of what Ms. Cosby is quoted as
saying except that she did have a substance abuse problem.
   Ms. Cosby, the second of Cosby's five children, told the
Lantana-based newspaper she began drinking and smoking marijuana
about age 14 while at boarding school.

   Medicare reform, research to determine
effective medical procedures and an emphasis on healthy living are
needed to avert a health care crisis in America, said a
congressional staff report released Monday.
   The report by the Democratic staff of the Joint Economic
Committee also said some form of national health insurance would
ensure that everyone gets high quality, affordable health care,
solving the problem posed by an estimated 37 million uninsured
Americans.
   But the report said such a system ``may be a long way from
becoming a reality'' because of political reasons and resistance by
physicians.
   The report compiles information gathered during nine days of
hearings last year by the health subcommittee of the Joint Economic
Committee, which advises Congress on economic trends but does not
initiate legislation.
   At a news conference where the report was distributed, Rep.
James H. Scheuer, D-N.Y., chairman of the health subcommittee, and
Joseph A. Califano Jr., former secretary of Health, Education and
Welfare and the lead witness in the hearings, said much could be
saved by ridding waste from the health care system and directing
the savings.
   ``It's not a situation where you have to spend more money,''
said Califano, who served under former President Carter. ``Let's
wring the waste out of the system and use it.''
   Americans spent more than $550 billion annually on health care,
but Scheuer said, ``this system is falling apart'' as costs for
medical care soar.
   Though the report lists national health insurance as the top
recommendation, it said that given the political realities,
cost-saving changes in the Medicare system _ the federal health
insurance program for the elderly _ would be more easily achieved
in the short run.
   The key change suggested by the report would reform the rates by
which physicians are reimbursed, lowering some and raising others
to make the system fairer and less complex. Such a change was
proposed in Congress earlier this year.
   The report also says standards of care must be developed based
on research on the effectiveness of various tests and procedures.
The report said an estimated 20 percent of medical services,
costing $125 billion a year, may be unnecessary. This effort to
reduce unneeded medical services is also being considered by
Congress.
   Also, physicians should more actively promote healthier
lifestyles through drug, alcohol and nutrition counseling and
screen for prevalent diseases so they can be caught in the early
stages, the report said.

   A 51-year absence from the stage in
Fort Worth only made Helen Hayes more charming to an enthralled
audience.
   The Academy Award-winning actress was joined briefly on stage by
her son, actor James MacArthur, for a Sunday benefit performance
attended by about 400 people at the Fort Worth theater.
   Ms. Hayes gave a lecture peppered with anecdotes from her eight
decades on the stage and performed a humorous James Thurber sketch
with her son.
   At the end of the 90-minute program, the audience sang ``Happy
Birthday'' with Van Cliburn accompanying on the piano. Ms. Hayes
will be 89 on Oct. 10.
   Ms. Hayes last appeared in Fort Worth in 1938, in the touring
version of ``Victoria Regina,'' playing Queen Victoria from youth
to old age.
   She said she has been inspired for more than 50 years by a line
from that play, in which a working-class Londoner shouts to the
aged Victoria: ``Go it, old girl! You done it good!''
   ``I think I want that on my tombstone,'' Ms. Hayes said.

   A planned barbecue was rained out, so rock
'n' roller Jerry Lee Lewis celebrated his 54th birthday with 400
relatives and friends at a golf club lodge on the outskirts of
Memphis.
   Friends say Lewis, who has been married six times and has
survived struggles with alcohol and drugs, has calmed down in
recent years, spending as much time as he can with his wife and
3-year-old son at their home in rural Mississippi near Memphis.
   Lewis played to those observations while performing an ad-libbed
rendition of ``Goodnight Irene.''
   ``Jerry Lee, you've stopped your ramblin' and you've stopped
your gamblin,'' he sang at Friday's party. ``You've got a nice home

   Willcox's favorite son, cowboy singer and

and his wardrobes, movie posters, silver saddle, record jackets,
comic books and other mementos.
   The Rex Allen Arizona Cowboy Museum will open during the 38th
annual Rex Allen Days, Saturday and Sunday.
   A fundraiser in Phoenix earlier this year raised some $100,000
and was attended by the likes of Allen, Gene Autry, Roy Rogers and
Glen Campbell.
   The museum is in a building that was a pre-Prohibition saloon.
Exhibits will touch on local history in addition to Allen's life _
from his youth spent in this southeastern Arizona town, through his
singing and movie days, and his numerous narrations for Disney
``World of Color'' specials.
   ``There's so much great history there,'' Allen, 68, said from
his home in Sonoita, southeast of Tucson. ``I think that's a lot
more important than doing something for some damn movie cowboy.''

   Celebrities including Stevie Wonder, Paula

Principal turned out for a fund-raiser thrown by radio personality
Casey Kasem and his actress wife, Jean.
   The Kasems transformed their luxurious home into a huge lawn
circus Sunday to raise money for the homeless.
   Jugglers, mimes, sword swallowers, clowns, and fire eaters
performed for the more than 2,000 guests, said Karen Kukurin, a
spokeswoman for the couple.
   The fund-raiser also featured an auction of $3.5 million worth
of sculpture and oil paintings.
   It was not immediately known how much the auction had raised for
an Oct. 7 march on Washington, D.C., to draw attention to the
problem on homelessness, said Kukurin.
   Kasem's syndicated radio show is heard 450 stations each week.
His wife's acting credits include the television series ``Cheers''

   Bill Cosby, who plays a wise father on his
hit series and wrote the best-seller ``Fatherhood'' about raising
his five children, says he and his wife refused to coddle a
daughter addicted to drugs and alcohol.
   ```Tough love' is the only way of dealing with this. We love her
and want her to get better, but we have to take a very firm, very
tough stand that forces her to realize that no one can fix things
for her,'' the star told the National Enquirer. ``She has to beat
this on her own.''
   Erinn Cosby, 23, who checked out of a drug rehabilitation center
Sept. 24, said she began using cocaine at age 19, but that her
parents had no idea she had a drug habit until she wrote them a
letter six months ago. She said she had kicked a $200-a-day cocaine
habit by then but was still hooked on marijuana and alcohol.
   ``People see Bill Cosby as a super dad. But I'm proof that drug
and alcohol tragedies can happen even in the most loving
families,'' said Erinn.
   The Enquirer piece was ``the only interview that he's been
willing to give on the matter,'' Cosby spokesman David Brokaw said
Monday. ``He has a relationship with them. He has found them to
treat him fairly.''

   Thousands of would-be emigrants lined up outside
the U.S. Embassy for visa applications Monday as new rules on
emigration took effect, but the embassy quickly ran out of new
forms and turned away thouands of angry people.
   Consular officials distributed 30,500 applications at a rate of
100 per minute, with a maximum of five allotted each person, before
running out in about 2{ hours.
   Another 70,000 application forms were expected to be delivered
to the embassy by the end of the week, an official said, and
300,000 more shortly thereafter. ``We hope to be out of the woods
by Friday,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Many Soviets were angry at being turned away and are upset at
the new regulations, which require applicants to deal with
Washington rather than the embassy in Moscow. The changes were made
because the Moscow embassy was unable to handle the flood of
applications.
   ``It is a conspiracy between the U.S. Congress and Soviet
authorities,'' said one woman who refused to give her name.
   ``The United States Embassy should be ashamed of the way they
are treating us,'' said another Soviet, who also refused to
identify himself.
   The United States has long urged the Soviet Union to liberalize
its emigration policy. But now that Soviet rules have become more
lax, the United States has found it cannot accept all the Soviets
who wish to emigrate.
   The new regulations that went into effect Oct. 1 spurred a surge
in the number of people lining up at the embassy, and more than
15,000 lined up over the weekend to be among the first to get new
forms.
   They organized themselves into groups of 100, with group leaders
holding up signs so people could secure a place in line, then leave
and return later.
   On Monday morning, traffic around the embassy on Moscow's busy
Garden Ring Road was snarled, and the sidewalks around the embassy
were jammed with people.
   When the applications ran out, people still were lined up
between signs with numbers up to 11,000. According to Soviets at a
shack set up to register for a place in line, 17,000 people had
signed up over the weekend.
   A reporter visiting the embassy was besieged by hundreds of
people who though he was a consular official. They demanded to know
when they would get the applications and whether photocopies would
be acceptable in Washington.
   Several times during the day, embassy officials waded into the
crowd that had waited overnight to explain that new forms would be
available Wednesday and that photocopies would be acceptable.
   Hundreds of people have lined up outside the embassy every
working day since Soviet officials began liberalizing emigration
policies last year, and U.S. officials have been swamped with
paperwork.
   Under the new regulations, applications will be sent directly to
Washington rather than evaluated by Moscow consular officials.
   An official said last week that the embassy is likely to receive
300,000 applications in the next year but will be able to accept
only about 70,000-80,000.
   Following ceilings set in Washington, the United States will
accept 50,000 Soviets classified as refugees and another
20,000-30,000 on a so-called parole system that does not guarantee
any government support.
   The new system also gives priority to people with close
relatives already in the United States and to those who belong to
groups that the United States considers to be persecuted in the
Soviet Union.

<TEXT>
   Scores of small earthquakes shook Mount
Etna on Monday, threatening to open a new fissure on Europe's most
active volcano, scientists said.
   The volcano has been erupting since Sept. 11, coughing plumes of
ash and lighting the night sky with spectacular fountains of lava
down its southeastern flank. Officials say it poses no threat to
nearby villages.
   Since Sunday night, there have been 30 to 35 temblors an hour on
the volcano, scientists said. The quakes cracked pavement and
forced the closure of a road used to reach sites on the
southeastern side of the mountain.
   Some of the quakes had a magnitude of more than 2 on the Richter
scale of ground motion, said Giovanni Fazzetta, one of the
scientists monitoring the eruption.
   A quake of magnitude 2 on the scale, which gauges the energy
released by an earthquake as measured by a seismograph, is the
smallest normally felt by humans.
   The increase in quakes could open a new lava-spilling fissure on
the southern flank of Mount Etna, Fazzetta said.

   Nobel laureate Mother Teresa developed
chest pains, but doctors attending her said Monday her condition

   The 79-year-old Roman Catholic nun was admitted Sept. 5 to the
Woodlands Nursing Home hospital with a high fever and an irregular
heartbeat.
   Doctors said she developed chest pains Sunday, but ``She has

   ``There is nothing to worry about ... she is now all right,''
the doctors said.
   Mother Teresa's condition twice become critical after she
suffered a heart attack while in the hospital's intensive care unit
Sept. 8.
   Despite her poor health in recent years, the Yugoslav-born nun
travels widely to offer care and comfort to the destitute. Her work
earned her a Nobel Peace Prize in 1979.
   Mother Teresa founded the Missionaries of Charity in 1950 to
care for the poor of this eastern Indian city's slums. The order,
which was formally recognized by the Vatican in 1965, expanded and
now has 3,000 nuns working for it in 87 countries.

<HEAD>Disciplinary Inquiry Being Conducted for USS Iowa Officers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Associated Press Military Writer=
   Vice Adm. Joseph S. Donnell III, the commander of the Atlantic
Fleet's Naval Surface Force, is in the Mediterranean conducting a
disciplinary inquiry for officers of the USS Iowa, Pentagon sources
said today.
   The admiral is conducting a ``flag mast,'' a non-judicial form
of inquiry, to determine whether the captain and several other
officers should be punished for infractions in Navy procedure found
after the April 19 explosion that claimed 47 sailors' lives, said
the source, who spoke on condition of not being identified by name.
   Commanders are responsible for ``good order and discipline'' in
their commands.
   In its lengthy study of the blast, the Navy determined that the
explosion in the battleship's No. 2 gun turret ``most likely'' was
caused by gunner's mate Clayton Hartwig.
   But the investigation conducted by Rear Adm. Richard Milligan
also found numerous lax procedures aboard the Iowa, including
unauthorized experimentation with extra-strength gunpowder and
projectile loads.
   Milligan also found that the officers had failed to qualify
enough sailors for their specific duties in the gun turret and that
many safety procedures had been circumvented.
   The admiral's investigation determined, however, that neither
the experiments nor the procedural lapses had caused the explosion.
Instead, Milligan said, Hartwig probably sparked the fireball by
inserting a type of detonator between two power bags.
   In his section of the report, Milligan also recommended that the
captain, Fred Moosally, and four other high-ranking men aboard the
ship be relieved of their duties and that appropriate disciplinary
action be taken against them.
   Milligan's recommendation, however, was softened by his
superiors. They recommended that the men receive the non-judicial
punishment meted out through the mast procedure.
   The admiral could, for example, suspend the officers from duty
for not more than 30 days in addition to issuing a reprimand. Other
possible disciplinary action might include pay cuts or other
restrictions.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House on Monday approved a 4.9 percent
cost-of-living increase in benefits for some 2.5 million disabled
veterans and their survivors.
   The increase, effective Dec. 1, would raise from $1,468 to
$1,539 a month the basic benefit payment for a veteran with 100
percent disability resulting from his or her service in the
military.
   Maximum monthly benefits would rise from $2,559 to $2,684 under
the legislation, which was approved without opposition on a voice
vote.
   The increases will raise the annual cost of veterans' disability
and survivor beneifts _ now estimated at $10.2 billion _ by $398
million in fiscal 1990, which began on Sunday, and by $525 million
in fiscal 1991, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
   Also approved was legislation extending Vietnam era GI Bill
education benefits to 1977 and 1978 graduates of the military
academies and 1978 graduates of Reserve Officer and Training Corps
programs at other schools.
   In addition, education benefits for members of the military
reserves _ now limited to only undergraduate college courses _
would be expanded to cover graduate school courses, technical
schools, correspondence courses and on-the-job training.
   The package of legislation also renames the Department of
Veterans Affairs' outpatient clinic in Daytona Beach, Fla., after
former Rep. William V. Chappell Jr., D-Fla.; its medical center in
Leavenworth, Kan., after former President Dwight D. Eisenhower, and
its outpatient clinic in Mount Vernon, Mo., after former Rep. Gene
Taylor, R-Mo.
   It also orders the Army to set aside an appropriate area at
Arlington National Cemetery for the unmarked burial of cremated
remains.

<TEXT>
   Like many a construction project, the 31-mile rail
link being built beneath the English Channel is going to cost a lot
more than planned and might not be finished on time.
   The cost of the project, estimated in 1987 at $7.8 billion, has
grown 44 percent and now is $11.3 billion, builders said Monday.
   Project contractors blame the cost increase on inflation,
construction problems and higher costs for rail cars.
   The news sent shares of Eurotunnel PLC, the Anglo-French
consortium building the link betwen England and France, slumping 72
cents to $10.47 in trading on London's Stock Exchange. Shares were
trading at about $16.10 in late July, when Eurotunnel first
indicated it would need more money.
   Eurotunnel initially arranged $8.1 billion in loans and raised
$1.61 billion by selling stock in the project. Now it needs to
raise at least $1.61 billion more, said Eurotunnel co-chairman
Alastair Morton.
   The consortium said it would seek to raise the extra funds next
year or in 1991, 75 percent from its banks and the remainder
perhaps by selling additional shares to current shareholders.
   In addition to denting investor confidence, the announcement
fueled fears that the builders might be unable to complete the
tunnel without government aid and that the higher costs would lead
to higher fares.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher supports the project but has
maintained that no public funds would go toward it.
   Added to the financial problems are concerns about when the link
will be completed. Technical advisers to the banks funding the
project say it might be 5{ months late, on Dec. 31, 1993.
Eurotunnel insists it will be completed by its mid-1993 deadline.
   Workers on both sides of the channel began drilling toward each
other in mid-1987. One tunnel, the service tunnel, is more than
half-finished, but much work remains on the other two, which will
carry trains in opposite directions.
   The trains are to allow passengers, cars and freight to travel
between London and Paris in three hours.

<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 4th graf, `The Woods...', to UPDATE with arraignment postponed.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EUGENE, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An affluent New York doctor and his wife are
facing prostitution-related charges for allegedly conducting a
phony research project that included a sex tour of West Coast
college campuses.
   Rodney Thorp Wood, 60, faces a charge of promoting prostitution
while his wife, Nancy Steffen Wood, 44, faces a prostitution
charge, Eugene police Sgt. Rick Gilliam said last week.
   The Woods were originally ordered to appear in court today, but
Lane County assistant district attorney Sean Hoar said today that
attorneys agreed to delay the appearance while the investigation
continued. If convicted, Wood faces up to five years in prison and
a $100,000 fine, Mrs. Wood up to a year and a $2,500 fine.
   A 19-year-old University of Oregon student who allegedly
participated in a ``research'' session with the Woods is charged
with prostitution.
   The Southampton, N.Y., couple visited the Oregon campus two
weeks ago, telling male students they were ``evaluating the sexual
potential of the mature female'' for an Oxford University project
and would pay participants at least $10 for the encounter, Gilliam
said.
   Mrs. Wood distributed ``letters of introduction'' explaining the
supposed research project to young men on campus, Gilliam said.
   The couple were arrested after police, tipped by two students,
sent an undercover officer posing as a student to their hotel.
   Police later found a list of schools including Oregon State
University, the University of Washington, the University of
Victoria, British Columbia, and the University of California at
Berkeley, Gilliam said.
   ``They were traveling the West Coast with major universities on
their itinerary,'' Gilliam said. ``As I understand from a
background check in New York, they're real affluent and giving away
this kind of money isn't going to hurt them any.''
   The 19-year-old was identified through photographs the Woods
took and through a form listing biographical and sexual information
about him, Gilliam said. Police were unable to locate a second man
who appeared to have taken part in another session, he said.
   ``Because there was money exchanged for a sexual act, it was
prostitution,'' Gilliam said.

<HEAD>Purina Gets Down and Dirty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY SCHWARTZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There are just so many ways that you can sell
dog food, but Ralston Purina has found another one.
   In a full-page ad in Monday's New York Times, the St.
Louis-based purveyor of Puppy Chow claimed that ``If more dogs in
New York ate Purina Hi Pro, it would seem like there were less dogs
in New York.''
   Under that headline, there is a large picture of a disgusted
businessman, standing on one foot while examining the bottom of his
left shoe.
   He is not looking for gum on his heel.
   ``Hi Pro's high digestibility means smaller, firmer stools,''
the ad advises. ``The more nutrients a dog digests, the less passes
through his system _ and onto our sidewalks.''
   This is not what a Times reader expects with breakfast. A call
to Ralston Purina was referred to company spokesman Patrick
Farrell; he said he needed to do some research before he could talk
about the ad.
   ``I'll get all the scoop and the dirt on it and I'll call you
right back,'' he said.
   When he called back, he was a font of dog food information.
``When you _ well, not you, but when your dog eats, his system
absorbs the nutrients and the rest passes through. I don't know of
any polite way to discuss this.''
   Normal dog foods have a digestibility rating of 70 percent _
meaning 70 percent is absorbed and the rest passes through. Hi
Pro's rating is 82 percent, so ``less is coming out the other
end,'' Farrell said.
   Ralston Purina did no extensive field testing on New York
streets before plunging ahead with its ad campaign, which consists
of the ad in the Times and upcoming placards on telephone kiosks
around the city.
   Hi-Pro itself is not a new product; the company has been selling
it for more than a decade.
   ``We don't think for a moment that we have the solution to the
`Oops, I stepped in it' problem in New York,'' the ad says. ``But
perhaps we can help a little _ by making the pickups a little
quicker and easier for dog owners. And even when the scofflaws
won't pick up, the mess won't be quite as messy.''
   Farrell said New York is the only city slated for the ad
campaign. ``Very few cities have that same urban lifestyle,'' he
said.
   No television ads are planned. ``It would be difficult, wouldn't
it?'' he suggested.
   He said the company did not expect any, uh, flak from readers
who might be offended by the ad and its depiction of an unfortunate
pedestrian.
   ``There's actually nothing on the bottom of his shoe, is
there?'' he said.

<HEAD>Court Will Use Hitchcock Thriller to Study Copyright Rights</HEAD>

   The Supreme Court said Monday it will use the
famous Alfred Hitchcock thriller ``Rear Window'' to decide a
copyright dispute in which millions of dollars, and possibly the
future of some movie classics, are at stake.
   The justices said they will hear arguments on behalf of actor
Jimmy Stewart, Hitchcock's heirs and others seeking to prevent a
literary agent from sharing in profits from the motion picture's
re-release.
   The agent, Sheldon Abend, in 1971 purchased a copyright to the
short story on which ``Rear Window'' was based. Abend paid $650 to
Chase Manhattan Bank for the copyright.
   He filed a federal lawsuit seeking a share of the more than $12
million in revenue that ``Rear Window'' has generated since 1983,
when the 1954 movie was released once again in theaters and for the
first time on video casettes and over cable television.
   ``Rear Window'' is based on a short story, ``It Had to Be
Murder,'' that was first published in February 1942 in Dime
Detective Magazine.
   The copyright was owned by the story's author, Cornell Woolrich,
who sold the separate motion picture rights in 1945 for $9,250.
   ``Rear Window,'' starring Stewart and Grace Kelly and directed
by Hitchcock, had many elements not contained in the original short
story.
   Woolrich died in 1968 without any surviving spouse or children
and left his property to a trust administered by Chase Manhattan.
   Abend said in his suit that his copyright was infringed by the
re-release of ``Rear Window.''
   He also said the film distributors _ including Stewart and
Hitchcock's heirs _ interfered with his plans to contract with Home
Box Office for a new play and TV version of the story.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based in San Francisco,
ruled in Abend's favor last December, ordering a lower court to
hear his suit for damages. The appeals court noted that its ruling
is in conflict with a 1977 decision by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals, based in New York City.
   The appeals court noted that before 1976 federal law permitted a
copyright to be renewed for 28 years after the initial 28-year
copyright period ended.
   The law was amended in 1976 to provide for copyright protection
for the life of the author plus 50 years _ but only to works
copyrighted after Jan. 1, 1978.
   In Abend's case, the appeals court said he is entitled to
copyright renewal protection even though Woolrich died before the
copyright was renewed.
   The appeals court acknowledged that the success of ``Rear
Window'' was due to ``the collaborative efforts of many talented
individuals other than Cornell Woolrich.''
   Nonetheless, the appeals court said Woolrich's contribution was
significant and Abend still must be allowed to seek damages for
copyright infringement.
   But the court barred Abend from blocking distribution of ``Rear
Window.'' Such an injunction could deny ``the public the
opportunity to view a classic film for many years to come,'' the
appeals court said.
   Some of the nation's leading motion picture producing companies
are supporting the appeal by Stewart and Hitchcock's heirs.
   They said that thousands of films based on books, plays and
short stories might have to be withdrawn from distribution if the
9th Circuit court ruling stands.
   The case is Stewart vs. Abend, 88-2102.

   A search for memorabilia to display for Carnegie
Hall's hundredth birthday turned up a Bennie Goodman clarinet and
the ribbon cut on opening night in 1891, the hall's archivist said
Monday.
   Archivist Gino Francesconi is looking for more souvenirs for
special exhibitions in 1990 and 1991.
   ``People have responded from all over the country. It's just
been fantastic,'' he said. ``But we're fighting the clock now.
We've given ourselves until March to look for material.''
   So far the search has turned up the silver trowel used by Andrew
Carnegie's wife, Louise, to lay the concert hall's cornerstone in
1890 and a ribbon that was cut on opening night in 1891.
   Bennie Goodman's daughter, Rachel Edelson, donated one of her
father's clarinets, and lots of photographs and recordings have
surfaced.
   ``We're desperately searching now for posters prior to 1960,''
Francesconi said. ``Most of those are just hanging on people's
walls. I can't believe that there aren't posters of Mark Twain,
Woodrow Wilson, Toscanini out there.''
   At the top of Francesconi's wish list: ``I would give anything
for a ticket from opening night, 1891. I know it's out there. ... I
was told by a collector that he had seen it five or six years ago.''
   Composers are being asked to write down a few measures of their
music that was performed at the hall, then sign it.

<TEXT>
   Anglican leader Robert Runcie and Pope John
Paul II signed a document Monday committing their churches to
eventually heal their 450-year-old split but recognizing they still
had a long way to go.
   Runcie's first official visit to the Vatican yielded few other
visible signs of progress in relations between the world's two
largest groups of Christians.
   However, Runcie said he had built trust with Vatican officials
during four days of talks and that their commitment to seeking
unity was no mere ``academic exercise.''
   ``The way in which the conversations we have had together bear
fruit will come about gradually,'' he told a news conference.
   Among major points separating the churches is the doctrine of
papal infallibility, which applies to Roman Catholic beliefs such
as the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary and her assumption
to heaven after death.
   Runcie is the fourth archbishop of Canterbury to visit the
Vatican since the late Geoffrey Fisher did so in 1960, ending four
centuries of estrangement that began when King Henry VIII formed
his own church after the pope refused to grant him an annulment of
his marriage.
   Talks have been under way since 1966 on a theological framework
for unifying the world's 850 million Roman Catholics and 70 million
Anglicans.
   The document signed Monday said: ``We here solemnly recommit
ourselves and those we represent to the restoration of visible
unity and full ecclesial communion.''
   But it noted the ordination of women in some of the Anglican
Communion's 27 self-governing provinces, such as the U.S. Episcopal
Church, ``prevents reconciliation between us even where there is
otherwise progress toward agreement.''
   Nonetheless, Cardinal Johannes Willebrands, president of the
Vatican's Council for Promoting Christian Unity, said ``obstacles
are there to be considered and overcome.''
   Runcie, the head of the state Church of England, repeatedly
emphasized one of the advances in Anglican-Catholic talks _ an
Anglican proposal to grant the pope a ``universal primacy'' over
Anglicans.
   Other advances in recent years have included a draft agreement
on how people's souls are saved.
   But many practical barriers to unity remain, including
differences on the Catholic ban on artificial birth control; some
Anglican churches' acceptance of abortion and divorce; the role of
lay people in the church; and the Anglican practice of allowing
married priests.
   Still, Anglican-Catholic talks are considered among the most
promising inter-faith discussions in which the Vatican is involved,
and Anglican officials say they expect some kind of unity in the
21st century.
   While both sides described the Anglican-Catholic meetings as
extremely friendly, Runcie's speeches expressed more eagerness
about unification than the pope's.
   Willebrands indicated the hesitancy of some Vatican officials
when he discussed a delay in the church's response to a 7-year-old
Anglican-Catholic report on possible theological agreements.
   ``We have often to consider in the church at large ... problems
of internal struggles or differences of opinion, etcetera, and it
is rather new to consider officially ecumenical documents,'' he
said.
   Runcie left the Vatican meetings with the promise Catholic
officials would respond soon to the 1982 report by the theological
commission.
   That report included agreements on the Eucharist and priesthood
and said Anglicans could recognize the pope as a universal primate,
but with somewhat reduced powers.
   Runcie's appeals for a leadership role for the pope drew fire
from the Rev. Ian Paisley, a Northern Ireland Protestant leader and
anti-pope activist, who charged at an impromptu news conference
that Runcie was trying to ``dethrone the queen and enthrone the
pope'' in England.
   But Runcie said he envisioned a spiritual rather than political
role for the pope, aimed at helping churches to promote religious
practice.

   Police arrested an opposition leader and
eight supporters who were touring remote provinces urging people to
join a boycott of the military-controlled government, a fellow
opposition politician said.
   Ricardo Arias Calderon, a former candidate for vice president,
was arrested with the others on Sunday in Veraguas province, 180
miles west of Panama City, according to Guillermo Cochez, a fellow
Christian Democraty Party leader.
   The Panamanian Defense Forces announced in a statement that the
opposition figures were freed today. Their released could not be
confirmed.
   The statement came shortly after the Christian Democratic party
said that Arias Calderon would go on a hunger strike.
   The opposition has engaged in a campaign of urging people to
delay paying taxis and utility bills as a way of increasing
economic pressure on the government led by military strongman Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   The opposition also advocates a boycott of the lottery and
gambling casinos, which the government controls along with most of
the country's utilities.
   The Civic Democratic Opposition Alliance, which includes the
Christian Democrats, identified the other eight as party activists
Ivan Romero, his wife Mabel, Jose A. Sossa and his wife Gina,
Carlos Mantovani, Luis Eduardo Camacho, Temistocles de Obaldia and
Ramon Lima.
   Arias Calderon was one of two opposition vice presidential
candidates in May 7 national elections on a ticket led by Guillermo
Endara, who was in the 13th day of a hunger strike today as part of
the anti-Noriega campaign.
   The government annulled the May 7 election when returns showed
the opposition winning by a landslide.
   In a statement Sunday, Endara called Arias Calderon's arrest
``another symptom of despair by the dictatorship of Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega to repress the last vestiges of freedom and
democracy that remain in Panama.''
   The government, which depends heavily on revenues from the
lottery and casinos, has been short of funds since the United
States imposed trade and other economic sanctions on Panama soon
after federal courts in Florida indicted Noriega on
drug-trafficking and money-laundering charges in 1988.
   Endara, Arias Calderon, and his other running mate Guillermo
Ford want Noriega to respect the results of the May elections.
   The United States refuses to recognize the Noriega-dominated
government and considers Endara and his running mates Panama's
legitimate leaders.
   Noriega named his longtime friend, Francisco Rodriguez, as
provisional president on Sept. 1, the day Endara was to have been
sworn in.

<TEXT>
   A state legislator who spent the last four
months in jail for drunken driving resigned Monday amid pressure
from his colleagues, including threats by House Republicans to try
to expel him.
   State Rep. Dennis Dutko, an eight-term lawmaker from Warren, is
an acknowledged alcoholic with a history of drunken driving
incidents dating to 1973. During his time in jail, he has donated
his $42,670 salary to drug and alcohol treatment programs.
   Lawmakers had become increasingly concerned about the effect of
Dutko's jailing on the Legislature's integrity. But they were
reluctant to expel someone who was convicted of a misdemeanor
rather than a felony because it would be setting a precedent.
   The resignation came after last week's hint by House Minority
Leader Paul Hillegonds that he would call for an expulsion vote or
at least censure if the situation didn't change.
   Dutko twice said he'd resign, but backed down both times. He was
awaiting results of a floundering recall effort and his aides said
he still gets letters from constituents who don't think he should
step down.
   ``I am sure that many people will criticize me for not stepping
down sooner, but, in all honesty, I could not walk away from the
job and the people I love without a fight,'' Dutko said in his
resignation letter.
   He was jailed May 24, serving six-month and one-year sentences
concurrently. His scheduled release, counting time off for good
behavior, is Jan. 3.

<HEAD>Air Force Spent $12.8 Million Renovating Officers' Club</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Renovation of an officers' club at the largest
U.S. Air Force base in Europe cost nearly three times the original
pricetag of $4.5 million, according to a Defense Department report
released Monday.
   The House Armed Services Committee had requested the review,
citing reports of construction and funding abuses.
   Work on the club at Ramstein Air Base in West Germany totaled
$12.8 million due to the use of incomplete and misleading data,
design changes that had to be made after construction began and
structural problems with the building, the report said.
   In fact, the facility was so structurally unsound contractors
were forced to raze all of the building except for the kitchen and
several small walls, said the review conducted by the Defense
Department's Inspector General.
   ``We had an officers' club that began as a Volkswagon and ended
as a Mack Truck rolling over anyone who got in its way,'' said Rep.
Marvin Leath, D-Texas, a member of the Armed Services subcommittee
on readiness.
   The report found that the original cost proposals for
construction of the club were based on inaccurate information.
After the work began, 130 design changes were made at a cost of
about $1.6 million.
   In addition, the review found that management ``had not operated
the club system efficiently, effectively or profitably from fiscal
1984 to fiscal 1987.''
   Leath, who released the report, said enlisted officers at the
base saw ``their financially sound clubs go into the hole several
million dollars. These operations lost $10,000 a day as management
was diverted to throw lavish parties for thousands of people.''
   ``This report reads like a base operations horror story,'' said
Rep. David O'B. Martin, R-N.Y., another member of the subcommittee.
   The Air Force, in comments included in the report, said the
service has begun follow-up audits and the Office of Special
Investigation is looking into whether civil or criminal charges are
warranted.

<TEXT>
   Lebanese legislators meeting here
Monday put aside the problem of Syria's military presence in
Lebanon to discuss ways to disarm unruly militiamen and draft a
national charter to end the country's civil war.
   New tensions surfaced, however, over a surprise visit to Iran by
two key Moslem militia chieftains, Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt and
his Shiite Moslem civil war ally, Nabih Berri.
   Most of the 63 parliamentarians meeting here _ 33 Christians and
30 Moslems _ interpreted the trip as an Iranian attempt to
undermine the conference, under way since Saturday, conference
sources said.
   Berri heads the Shiite Moslem Amal militia and Jumblatt commands
the Progressive Socialist Party. Together, the two factions
comprise about 12,000 fighters.
   Tehran radio, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Berri as saying: ``We
are vehemently opposed to the plan submitted by the tripartite Arab
committee to solve the crisis in Lebanon.''
   The committee, composed of Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Algeria,
has proposed a peace plan that includes a series of political
reforms designed to end the Christian domination of government,
Parliament, the army and the judiciary in Lebanon.
   The conference sources said the parliamentarians on Monday were
going over the proposed national reconciliation charter ``point by
point.''
   The charter would serve as an alternative to an unwritten
national covenant reached among the various sects in 1943, when
Lebanon gained independence from France.
   ``This plan does not conform with the wishes and aspirations of
the Moslems. This plan ... will result in the division of
Lebanon,'' Berri said.
   Berri and Jumblatt are Syria's main allies. Their support and
that of their rival Lebanese Forces coalition of Christian militias
is essential for implementing any agreement that may be reached in
Taif.
   Despite political problems, a cease-fire called by the Arab
mediators Sept. 22 to end six months of fierce artillery battles
between the Syrians and Christians was holding.
   The Christians' demand that a timetable for the withdrawal of
the Syrian army from Lebanon be workd out before political reforms
hampered progress during Saturday and Sunday.
   But Saudi Arabia's foreign minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal,
steered the deputies away from arguments, persuading them to
discuss instead the proposed political reforms.
   Faisal is sitting in on the Parliament debates along with his
Moroccan and Algerian counterparts, Abdel-Latif al-Filali and
Bouallam Belsayeh.
   The deputies also discussed how to disarm militia factions whose
military strength has eroded government authority.
   The sources said several suggestions were being examined for
disbanding the militias, including attaching some of them to
various military corps.
   They said most deputies appeared to favor a timetable, phasing
Syrian withdrawal from Moslem sectors of Beirut to the Bekaa Valley
in east Lebanon over two years while the country's constitutional
structure, virtually dismantled by the war, is rebuilt.
   But most of the Christian deputies, backed by some Moslems
allied with Iraq, Syria's rival in the Arab world, demanded an
immediate Syrian withdrawal.
   The Syrian army has 40,000 troops in Lebanon, controlling 70
percent of the country.
   The troops entered Lebanon in 1976, a year after the civil war
broke out, under an Arab League peacekeeping mandate.
   Christian leader Gen. Michel Aoun, who is backed by Iraq, says
the Syrians abrogated their peacekeeping mandate by openly siding
with the Moslems.

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev urged the
legislature on Monday to impose a 15-month ban on strikes that he
says are wrecking the Soviet economy and threatening development.
   Gorbachev spoke at the end of a stormy two-hour legislative
debate on a proposal of emergency economic measures put forward by
First Deputy Premier Lev Voronin, the Tass news agency said.
   Gorbachev urged legislators to discuss the strike ban overnight
and be ready to vote on it Tuesday.
   He referred to the possible ban on strikes as a ``necessary
measure ... which are called for to protect democratization from
anarchy and irresponsible management.''
   Plans for future economic development are ``under threat''
because of the strikes, he said.
   Emergency measures to bolster the rapidly faltering economy
overshadowed Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov's lengthy presentation of a
package of legislation covering the government's long-term
proposals on property, ownership and use of land, and taxes.
   Voronin told the legislature the Soviet economy had lost $6.15
billion in July and August alone due to strikes and that supplies
of fuel are low enough that the country might be unable to supply
enough heat to see Soviet citizens through the winter.
   The most damaging of a series of strikes to hit the Soviet Union
this year was a walkout in July by thousands of coal miners in the
far north, Siberia, and the Don Basin of the eastern Ukraine.
   That strike alone cost the country millions of rubles, and the
government agreed to a package of economic and social improvements
that officials say will cost about $3 billion.
   Strikes also have become a way of expressing ethnic discontent.
Such actions have idled the Nagorno-Karabakh region, the center of
a dispute between the neighboring Caucasus republics of Armenia and
Azerbaijan.
   In Moldavia and Estonia, Russian and other workers walked off
jobs at factories and offices during the summer to protest laws
that they said favored the majority Moldavians and Estonians.
   After legislators expressed contradictory viewpoints during a
debate, Gorbachev proposed they return Tuesday to vote on the
strike ban, and an overwhelming majority agreed, Tass said.
   The package of government proposals also calls for imposing a
``special form of administration'' on railroads in Armenia and
Azerbaijan, with the ministries of railroads, defense and interior
responsible for protecting the railroads and their workers.
   Armenian activists say Azerbaijani railroad workers recently
have blocked the trains that Armenia depends upon for 80 percent of
the goods brought in from other parts of the Soviet Union.
   Food stores have been emptied of many basic goods and there is
no fuel even for vehicles such as ambulances.
   Gorbachev said when the Supreme Soviet opened its fall session
Sept. 25 that decisive steps would have to be taken if rails to
Armenia were not cleared.
   Ryzhkov and radical deputies both named the law on property as
the most important of five key economic reforms presented to the
legislature, but they disagreed on what it should say.
   Ryzhkov said the central government must learn to refrain from
interfering in local economic affairs _ including its tendency to
claim all forms of property for itself.
   ``As long as about 90 percent of the basic means of production
belong in the framework of one owner _ the government _ all talk
about developing a market will remain empty words, and progress is
impossible,'' he said.
   But progressive Deputy Anatoly Sobchak of Leningrad said the
government's proposal still started from the point of view that the
state had priority of ownership, and individuals were last.
   He said it should be just the opposite.
   Ryzhkov said the government saw no reason to allow private
ownership of land but supported expanded rights for farmers who
lease land on long-term contracts from collective and state farms.

<HEAD>Newspaper Says East German Leader Will Step Down After Anniversary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East German leader Erich Honecker will
likely step down after upcoming celebrations marking the 40th
anniversary of his Communist nation, a newspaper reported Monday.
   The Bonn-based Die Welt said Honecker's doctors have determined
he is suffering from a ``total deterioration of his internal
organs.''
   The conservative newspaper said ``there are indications'' the
77-year-old Honecker will be replaced soon after the celebrations
this weekend.
   It did not name its sources.
   Die Welt said that in addition to suffering from gallbladder
ailments, Honecker is plagued by pancreatic disorders.
   West German news reports in August said Honecker was suffering
from cancer, but those reports were denied by East German officials.
   East German media have said only that Honecker is recovering
well from a gallbladder operation.
   Die Welt's report was to appear in its Tuesday edition. A
summary of its report was telexed to other news media in advance.
   The report came as East Germany copes with the exodus of
thousands of its citizens to the West. Hungary opened its Western
border Sept. 11, defying its Communist ally, and East Berlin has
agreed to free thousands who had holed themselves up in West German
embassies in Czechoslovakia and Poland.

   Actor George Hamilton, who once got a loan from
a company with reported ties to Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos, is one
of 61 unindicted co-conspirators named in the Marcos case,
according to court papers.
   Hamilton, Manhattan real estate developers Joseph and Ralph
Bernstein, and the Marcos' children, Irene, Imee and Ferdinand Jr.,
are among the unindicted co-conspirators named in documents filed
in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
   An unindicted co-conspirator may have done something to advance
an alleged criminal conspiracy, without necessarily knowing he or
she was doing it.
   An indictment last October charged that Mrs. Marcos and her late
husband, ousted Philippines President Ferdinand E. Marcos, stole
$168 million from the Philippine treasury. The trial is set to
begin in March.
   One of Mrs. Marcos' co-defendants, California Overseas Bank,
listed the unindicted co-conspirators in pretrial motion papers
asking for more information about evidence the government plans to
present.
   Hamilton bought a Beverly Hills estate once owned by Charlie
Chaplin for $1.2 million in 1981. The deal was financed by
Hamilton's own money, Wells Fargo Bank and the seller, said his
attorney, Michael Sherman.
   In late 1983, Hamilton used the increased value of the property
to get a five-year loan from Calno Holdings N.V. in the Netherlands
Antilles, which reportedly had ties with the Marcos family.
   Jeffrey Lane, a spokesman for Hamilton in Los Angeles, said the
actor could not comment until asking his attorneys to clarify the
ramifications, if any, of being an unindicted co-conspirator.
   The actor said through a spokesman in March 1986 that while he
had met Imelda Marcos, she had no financial interest in his home.
   Hamilton, who often has served as an escort for Elizabeth Taylor
and other celebrities, is known for his perpetual tan and his
portrayal of a vampire in the movie, ``Love at First Bite.'' He and
Mrs. Marcos have denied rumors linking them romantically; Mrs.
Marcos said they were just good friends.
   Two other unindicted co-conspirators, the Bernstein brothers,
told a congressional hearing that they managed the Marcoses' New
York real estate investments.
   The Bernsteins and Richard Hibey, a Washington attorney who
represents the Marcos family, did not immediately return calls to
their office for comment.

<HEAD>Four Killed as Train Crashes Into Truck</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A train carrying 125 passengers slammed
into a truck Monday after the truck driver apparently was blinded
by the sun and failed to see warning lights of a railway crossing.
Police said four people were killed.
   The crash threw four cars off the tracks and injured 26 people,
said police.
   The train from Hamburg, West Germany, was bound for Oslo,
Norway, when the accident occurred near Varobacka, 25 miles south
of Goteborg.
   Police spokesman Ove Bergman said most of the injured were from
Sweden and one was in critical condition. Six were reported
seriously hurt.
   ``I saw how he (the truck driver) pulled down his cap and
squinted against the sun before he accelerated to cross the tracks.
The warning lights were working,'' said a witness, Ake Strandberg,
who was quoted by the national news agency TT.
   The truck, loaded with asphalt, was ripped apart and chunks of
metal were thrown hundreds of yards.
   The truck driver and three people on the train died.
   The collision ripped a large hole in the side of the first
sleeping car where the passengers were killed.
   The train's engineer was quoted as saying he tried to catch the
driver's attention, then threw himself onto the floor an instant
before ramming the vehicle. He escaped with minor injuries.
   It was the worst train accident in Sweden since a head-on
collision in November 1987 killed nine people and injured 130.
   The national railway company, Statens Jarnvagar, had intended to
erect barriers later this month at the crossing.

<HEAD>Raleigh Times to Cease Publication Nov. 30</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Raleigh Times, the capital city's
afternoon newspaper for 110 years, will publish its final edition
Nov. 30, the newspaper's publisher said Monday.
   Frank Daniels Jr., president of The News and Observer Publishing
Co., said an internal task force had recommended closing The
Raleigh Times as part of a plan to expand and improve The News and
Observer, Raleigh's morning newspaper.
   ``The recommendation to cease publication of The Raleigh Times
was one that was accepted reluctantly, but it was not unexpected,''
Daniels said. ``For several years, we have watched as afternoon
dailies in metropolitan areas closed. We cannot make the
improvements The News and Observer needs and still publish a
quality afternoon newspaper.''
   In recent years, afternoon newspapers in Winston-Salem,
Greensboro and Charlotte also have ceased publication.
   Daniels said no employee layoffs are expected. The news staffs
of The Times and The News and Observer were combined in 1987.
   The News and Observer will have five sections effective Dec. 1
to accommodate syndicated columns and features carried by The
Times, as well as expanded news coverage, Daniels said.
   The Times grew from the Raleigh Evening Visitor, founded in
1879. After merging with two competitors, the paper was renamed The
Raleigh Times in 1901. The Park family of Raleigh bought the Times
in 1911, with John A. Park serving as editor and publisher for 44
years.
   The Times was sold to The News and Observer Publishing Co. in
1955.

<TEXT>
   Soviet authorities have formed an independent
commission to monitor psychiatric abuses, an embassy spokesman
testified Monday, but U.S. experts said the reform was not adequate
to readmit the Soviets to the World Psychiatric Association.
   Seeking to bolster the Kremlin case, Georgi Markosov of the
Soviet Embassy appeared before a House panel to detail reforms his
government has taken to correct psychiatric abuses against
political and religious prisoners.
   The Soviet ``All-Union Scientific Society of Psychiatrists ...
is doing its utmost to implement and translate into reality the
needed reforms in the field of medical care and psychiatric
health,'' said Markosov, reading a statement prepared by the Soviet
society for the hearing.
   ``To prevent the use of psychiatry for non-medical purposes as
well as to assure maximum openness in specific cases of misuse of
psychiatry, an independent commission has been established, which
is composed of eight persons ... The commission is independent from
the Health Ministry or any (Communist) Party or state organs,''
Markosov said.
   Before this year, it was rare for Soviet officials to testify
before Congress, but since January, about a half dozen have done so.
   Markosov also listed other reforms, including:
   _New regulations that led to dropping 736,000 people from
so-called psychiatric registration lists. U.S. experts said the
lists contained 10.2 million names, and were used for job screening.
   _New rules that bar forcible commitment to a psychiatric
institution without the consent of patients or their relatives,
unless the patient poses a physical danger. ``Psychiatrists who
wrongly hospitalize mentally healthy persons may be sentenced to a
two-year prison term.''
   _Abolition in the Russian federation, the largest of the 15
Soviet republics, of two laws often used against dissidents.
   _A ban on the use of sulphazine, a drug made of pulverized
sulphur that has been injected into political dissidents, causing
extreme pain, fever and disorientation. Western experts say it has
no medical value.
   Most of the steps had been publicized previously, but the
existence of the commission was not known in the West, said another
witness, Peter Reddaway, a George Washington University professor
who has written two books on Soviet psychiatric abuses and was a
member of a U.S. delegation that visited Soviet psychiatric
institutions this year.
   ``It remains to be seen whether it is indeed vigorous and
independent,'' said Reddaway.
   The American Psychiatric Association, which supported the work
of the U.S. delegation, has voted to oppose readmission of the
Soviet group to the world body, which is scheduled to meet in
Athens, Greece, Oct. 11-16.
   ``It is my sincere hope as well as the hope of the American
Psychiatric Association, that there will be a time in the near
future when we can whole-heartedly welcome the All-Union Society of
Psychiatrists and Narcologists of the USSR into the World
Psychiatric Assocation,'' testified Ellen Mercer, head of
international programs for the U.S. organization.
   ``It is also our concern that, unfortunately, this time has not
yet arrived,'' said Mercer.
   Soviet health officials who in the past sent dissidents to
psychiatric institutions remain in senior government posts, said
Reddaway, and they could resume their abuses if there is a
conservative reaction along the lines of the crackdown in China
this summer.
   The officials he mentioned were Yevgeny Chazov, the health
minister, Nikolai Zharikov, last year appointed the head of the
Soviet Society of Psychiatrists and Narcologists, Georgy Morozov,
who for decades has headed the Serbsky Institute where many
political dissidents have been held in psychiatric care, Alexander
Churkin, chief psychiatrist of the ministry of health, and Marat
Vartanyan.
   These conservatives, said Reddaway, ``have a well justified fear
that if there is a genuine reform in Soviet psychiatry, they will
be swept out of office.''
   Senior Soviet psychiatric authorities want to be readmitted to
the World Psychiatric Association, said Reddaway, but ``the
reformers within Soviet psychology are opposed to it.''
   Denying the Soviets readmission to the world body, said
Reddaway, ``would delay genuine reform of Soviet psychiatry...''
   Soviet psychiatric abuses have been publicized for years by
Western experts, some of whom also testified Monday, and are now
being discussed more openly in the Soviet press.
   The U.S. Delegation to Assess Soviet Psychiatry, which visited
the Soviet Union this year, reported to Congress that ``while some
victims have been released, forced incarceration under the guise of
treatment for insanity, remains an institutional problem,'' said
Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., who presided over the hearing.
   ``Perhaps even worse, the perpetrators of these abuses remain in
key leadership positions in Soviet psychiatry,'' said Waxman,
chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce Subcommittee
on Health and the Environment.

<HEAD>Four Sailors Tell of Survival at Sea</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four men whose 42-foot sailboat was
overturned in a storm say they drifted for nearly four months in
the South Pacific and survived by trapping rainwater, spearing fish
and eating seaweed.
   ``We needed a miracle, and we got one,'' New Zealand skipper
John Glennie said after the crewmen washed ashore Sunday and were
rescued on the Great Barrier Island. The four were all reported in
good condition.
   After wind pushed the overturned boat ashore, the survivors said
they spent their first night on land in 120 days, sheltered from
rain under a tree in the bush of the island, about 60 miles
northeast of Auckland.
   On Sunday, they walked through bush until breaking into an empty
cabin and finding warm clothes.
   Peter Speck, an island resident, first met the sailors at the
cabin.
   ``At first I thought these guys were nuts,'' Speck said. ``I
couldn't believe it.''
   The crew included owner and skipper Glennie, a sailor who
designed the craft for long-distance cruising; Phillip Hoffman and
Rick Hellriegel of New Zealand; and Jim Nalepka, 38, of
Minneapolis, Minn., who was in the second of two years as caterer
for the Outward Bound program in New Zealand.
   Nalepka's sister, Kathy Moynihan of New Brighton, Minn., said he
lost 25 pounds but was declared fit by doctors in Auckland after a
two-hour hospital visit.
   ``We never gave up hope. He kept hoping he was safe. ... This is
wonderful,'' she said. ``It's just an amazing story.''
   The sailors' trimaran Rose Noelle left Picton, on the northern
coast of the South Island of New Zealand, on June 1 for a
three-week Pacific Islands cruise that was to take them to Tonga.
   On the night of June 3, a strong wind grew to a 60-knot gale.
   ``About six o'clock in the morning there was a huge wave, and it
just flipped the boat upside down,'' Glennie said.
   The boat floated on its crossbeams and cabin top, with the cabin
top _ now the floor _ beneath a couple of feet of water, Glennie
said.
   The sailboat's light, buoyant bow rode high, so it always
pointed away from the wind, he said. The craft was stable and would
not sink unless it had broken apart.
   The men, jammed four abreast in its 54-inch width, cut a hole
through the hull of the yacht to gain dry access outside, without
having to swim through the now-watery tunnel of the hatch, Glennie
said.
   The yacht's two emergency locator beacons, designed to transmit
for 30 days, were switched on, but there was no sign from jets
overhead that their signals were detected.
   The boat was reported missing June 24 after it failed to arrive
in Tonga.
   For the first few weeks there were survival rations.
   ``We had plenty of soda stowed in the forward compartment,''
Glennie said. ``We had stacks of apples and kiwifruit and we got
plenty of moisture from those. But the drinks were rationed to a
few ounces every night.
   ``After about 40 days, when we had all come to terms with things
and began working as a team, we organized ourselves into making a
system to collect rainwater.''
   They split some plastic piping and placed the pieces together to
collect rainwater, which was drained into empty soft drink bottles,
Glennie said. They also ate seaweed and speared fish.
   ``We ate them raw, and we had plenty of vinegar on board to
marinate them in,'' he said.
   The sailors' families had given them up for dead, said Malcolm
Tomes, Glennie's brother-in-law.
   ``We were absolutely ecstatic to hear John's voice on the
phone,'' Tomes said. ``We were just so thrilled that he and the
rest of the crew are still alive after so many months ... The
celebrations are already under way.''

   The interview with Trump could be published early next year,
said Cindy Rakowitz, a Playboy spokeswoman.
   ``There is a good chance he will be on the cover,'' she said. It
would make him the fourth male cover, following Steve Martin in
1980, Burt Reynolds in 1979 and Peter Sellers in 1964.
   But the developer, who has already spread his name across
airplanes, buildings, a book and a game, won't be posing in the

   ``No he's not,'' said Norma Foerderer, an aide to Trump.
   Trump revealed during the magazine's 35th anniversary party in
December that he was being interviewed by Playboy.

   Nearly 10,000 people marched
through Leipzig on Monday demanding legalization of opposition
groups and adoption of democratic reforms in the country's largest
such protest since 1953.
   Witnesses said marchers chanted ``Gorby, Gorby!'' and ``We're
staying here!''
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is enormously popular
among East Germans, who hope his policies of economic and political
reforms may some day be adopted by their nation's hard-line
leadership.
   Gorbachev is expected to visit East Berlin next weekend to take
part in celebrations marking East Germany's 40th anniversary.
   East Germany's aging orthodox communist leadership has so far
rejected the need for reforms.
   In 1953, workers rose up throughout East Germany in an ill-fated
uprising later crushed by Soviet tanks.
   The demonstrators Monday also demanded legalization of
opposition groups, which have been suppressed by the government.
   Fledgling opposition groups have rejected fleeing the country or
emigration and said they want to work for change in this country of
16.6 million.
   Tens of thousands of East Germans fled over Hungary's newly
opened border and thousands more were allowed to travel to West
Germany this weekend after seeking refuge in Bonn's embassies in
Czechoslovakia and Poland.
   Witnesses said security officials followed the demonstration but
did not try to break it up.
   About 8,000 people took part in a similar march in Leipzig last
week.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Arizona death row inmate who is challenging
the state's capital punishment law won a Supreme Court hearing
Monday.
   The court's eventual ruling in Jeffrey Alan Walton's appeal also
could affect death row inmates in Idaho and Montana, two states
that have death penalty laws similar to Arizona's.
   Walton was convicted of robbing and fatally shooting Thomas
Powell near Tucson in March 1986.
   Powell was robbed in a bar parking lot and then driven in his
own car to a secluded area where he was shot.
   A trial jury heard testimony that Walton fired the fatal shot.
Walton denied he killed Powell, swearing that a co-defendant was
the gunman.
   The jury did not specify whether it found Walton guilty of
premeditated murder or ``felony murder,'' the taking of a life
during commission of a felony.
   Walton's lawyers sought unsuccessfully during his sentencing
trial to introduce testimony indicating that the jury had been
undecided whether Walton killed Powell.
   The Arizona Supreme Court upheld Walton's conviction and death
sentence in a ruling that conflicts with a decision by the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals.
   The federal appeals court previously overturned a key provision
of Arizona's death penalty statute in the case of John Harvey
Adamson, convicted of murdering reporter Don Bolles. Bolles, who
had been investigating organized crime for The Arizona Republic in
Phoenix, died June 11, 1976, nine days after his car exploded.
   The 9th Circuit, setting aside Adamson's death sentence, said
Arizona's death penalty law unconstitutionally deprives defendants
of the right to a jury trial because the judge, not the jury,
decides whether an accused murderer is guilty of a crime warranting
capital punishment.
   The appeals court has jurisdiction in nine Western states,
including Arizona, Montana and Idaho.
   The case is Walton vs. Arizona, 88-7351.

<HEAD>Mubarak Meets Bush, Pushes Peace Plan; Shamir Not Budging</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met with
President Bush Monday on Mideast peace efforts and said he saw a
``golden opportunity'' for a breakthrough between Israel and the
Palestinians.
   Mubarak said failing to seize the opportunity ``would be a grave
mistake'' and that he and Bush agreed ``to work closely together in
order to utilize the existing momentum.''
   ``The continuation of the status quo is hazardous to both''
Israel and the Palestinians, the Egyptian leader told reporters
after an Oval Office session lasting nearly an hour.
   However, even as Mubarak sought to promote his plan, which
includes a demand that Israel agree in principal to giving up
seized lands, aides to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said the
Israeli leader does not intend to alter his own Palestinian peace
initiative.
   Monday's White House session came amid new concern that settling
Jewish immigrants from the Soviet Union in the Israeli-occupied
West Bank could threaten peace efforts.
   Bush administration officials reacted coolly to an Israeli
request for $400 million in housing loan guarantees for about
100,000 Jewish emigres from the Soviet Union. Israeli officials
have said some dwellings probably will be in the West Bank.
   ``The United States policy is to oppose additional settlements
in the occupied territories,'' Secretary of State James A. Baker
III said. And presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater
declared, ``Our policy is we don't allow U.S. aid to be used for
resettlement in the West Bank.''
   Still, Baker and Mubarak were both upbeat about peace prospects.
   ``I think it's fair to say that we all hope that conditions
exist for progress,'' said Baker.
   The Egyptian president, after his meeting with Bush, Baker and
Vice President Dan Quayle, said: ``We believe the potential is
great for further progress. ... It would be a grave mistake to miss
the golden opportunity existing today.''
   In Jerusalem, Yossi Ahimeir, a spokesman for Shamir, said the
Israeli leader does not intend to alter his own peace plan despite
pressure from Egypt, the United States or the rival Israeli Labor
Party.
   ``Only five months have passed'' since Shamir presented his plan
for elections as a first step toward negotiations, and the prime
minister ``does not see any reason to change it,'' the spokesman
said.
   Shamir's plan calls for elections in the occupied territories to
choose delegates for negotiations with Israel. However, final
status on the lands occupied by Israel since the 1967 Middle East
war would be decided later.
   Mubarak told reporters here the essential next step in the peace
process is to persuade the Israelis and the Palestinians to enter
into a dialogue ``without preconditions.''
   Mubarak's meeting came as the United States was seeking to
persuade a reluctant Israel to open discussions with Palestinians
based on Mubarak's proposals.
   U.S. officials regard the 10-point Egyptian plan as a complement
to Shamir's proposal for elections in which Palestinians would
select representatives to negotiate with Israel on limited
self-government in the occupied territories.
   ``The Egyptian ten points ... do not represent a competing
proposal. They represent a means of getting a dialogue
established,'' Baker said on Monday.
   Mubarak made a similar comment.
   A key element of Mubarak's proposal is the convening of talks
between Israelis and Palestinians in Cairo _ so far resisted by
Shamir. The Israeli leader also opposes Mubarak's suggestion that
voting rights be extended to Arabs living in East Jerusalem and to
Palestinians who live outside the occupied territories.
   And Shamir has rejected Mubarak's suggestion that the outcome of
any negotiations be self-determination for the Palestinians.
   On prospects of a summit with Shamir, Mubarak noted that he had
talked to Shamir by phone last Friday and discussed preparations
for such a meeting.
   But, he said, ``such a meeting should come out of something.
Otherwise, it would have negative reactions from the peoples of
both sides. I don't want to make complications. That's why any
meeting needs a thorough preparation.''
   Quayle, meanwhile, told reporters at a luncheon on Monday that
the administration would be ``very supportive ... (of) a dialogue
between Shamir and Mubarak that can be meaningful.''
   After visiting the president, Mubarak had lunch at the State
Department with Baker.
   Baker reaffirmed U.S. backing for Mubarak's efforts to help
broker the Israeli-Palestinian dispute. ``We won't get to peace
until Palestinians and Israelis speak to each other,'' Baker said.
   Both Baker and Mubarak said they wished to withhold comment on
specifics dealing with Palestinian representation until after the
Israeli Cabinet meets on Thursday on the subject.
   At the same time, Baker confirmed, in part, a report in an
Egyptian newspaper, Al Akhbar, that the Bush administration had
proposed a joint commission to pave the way for elections in the
territories.
   ``I'm not sure you would call it a commission,'' he said. ``What
has been suggested is the possibility that the three nations (the
United States, Egypt and Israel) could in some way determine the
Palestinian representation with respect to the dialogue.''
   Mubarak's 10-point proposal stops short of demanding the
establishment of a Palestinian state, and it contains other
features which have attracted favorable comment from Israel's Labor
Party.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev urged the
parliament Monday to impose a 15-month ban on strikes, which he
said are wrecking the economy and endangering development.
   He spoke at the end of a stormy two-hour debate on emergency
economic measures proposed by Lev Voronin, the first deputy
premier, the official news agency Tass reported.
   Gorbachev urged legislators to discuss the proposals and be
ready to vote on Tuesday.
   He referred to the possible ban on strikes as a ``necessary
measure ... called for to protect democratization from anarchy and
irresponsible management.''
   Plans for future economic development are ``under threat'' from
the strikes, he said.
   Voronin said the ailing economy lost $6.15 billion in July and
August because of strikes, and fuel shortages might mean inadequate
heat this winter.
   Proposals for the next 15 months include ``a prohibition on
conducting strikes ... in all branches of the economy,'' Tass said.
   The package also calls for a ``special form of administration''
for railroads in Armenia and Azerbaijan, with the ministries of
railroads, defense and interior responsible for protecting the
lines and their workers.
   Armenian activists say Azerbaijani railroad workers have blocked
the trains that carry 80 percent of Armenia's goods from other
parts of the Soviet Union. Food stores have been emptied of many
basic goods and even ambulances lack fuel.
   When the Supreme Soviet opened its fall session Sept. 25,
Gorbachev said decisive steps would be required if the rail lines
remained blocked.
   The neighboring republics in the Caucasus are in conflict over
Nagorno-Karabakh, a region that is part of Azerbaijan but has a
predominantly Armenian population.
   This year's most damaging strike was a walkout in July by
thousands of coal miners in the far north, Siberia, and the Don
Basin of the eastern Ukraine. It cost millions of dollars, and the
government agreed to economic and social reforms officials say will
cost about $3.08 billion.
   Strikes have become a common way of expressing ethnic
discontent. In addition to the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute, Russian
and other workers have struck factories in Moldavia and Estonia to
protest laws favoring native populations.

   Two administration officials caught the brunt
of criticisms Monday for President Bush's refusal at the education
summit to commit to an increase in federal funding for the nation's
schools.
   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos irked a luncheon meeting of
black Republicans, telling them, ``Our role is not one of funding.''
   Across the street, Charles Kolb, a key Education Department
official who helped craft Bush's education budget, drew angry
responses from members of the Council of Urban Boards of Education
when he said the $353 billion estimated to be spent this year on
education by all levels of government is sufficient.
   Cavazos and Kolb were keeping to the line held by Bush at the
conclusion of the two-day summit last week with the nation's
governors who agreed jointly to develop national performance goals
by February.
   Milton Bins of the black GOP group, the Council of 100, sharply
questioned Cavazos on the administration's commitment to ensure
adequate funding to educate minority and disadvantaged youths.
   ``I am here to remind our nation that the problem (of equity
education) has not been solved,'' said Bins, noting that about 80
percent of most state legislators are from ``suburban or affluent
white communities.''
   ``There is no clear indication on the scene today that they are
going to take the advice from the governors,'' Bins added.
   Bins, deputy director of The Council of the Great City Schools,
was assured by Cavazos, the first Hispanic to head the Education
Department, that Bush continues to fight for equality. Cavazos
cited the president's support for funding specialized magnet
schools and for allowing parents to select the school their
children will attend.
   Kolb drew harsh criticism when he discussed Bush's stances on
funding and choice with the schools council, which is part of the
National School Boards Association.
   ``There was a general recognition that money wasn't the issue,''
said Kolb in summarizing the summit.
   ``The biggest challenge for all of us _ on the federal, state
and local levels _ is to find ways to deploy the resources'' that
are already available for education, Kolb said.
   Stephen Kafoury, a member of the Portland, Ore. school board,
said more money is needed for schools and stressed that to imply
otherwise would be ``disingenuous at best.''
   ``I thought this area had been declared a drug free zone and
here I am wondering what you've been smoking,'' said a sarcastic
Jonathan Wilson, of the Des Moines Independent Community School
District. ``You've got to look at what we're doing with the money.''
   Wilson's was greeted with cheers and applause when he compared
the amounts spent on the military and the savings and loan
associations bailout with federal spending on education.
   ``He bailed out the S&amp;Ls. The man didn't say he wanted to be the
S&amp;L president, he said he wanted to be the education president,''
said Wilson, referring to Bush's pledge during last year's
presidential campaign.
   ``What we need is more resources, not someone talking
platitudes. The real test is what are the resources and where are
they coming from.''
   NSBA President James Oglesby admitted the group ``beat up on
Kolb'' but said it was because many of the members are frustrated
volunteers.

   The Soviet Union is equipping some of its
tanks with several layers of a special armor that can withstand
certain types of U.S. missiles, the chairman of the House Armed
Services Committee said Monday.
   The Soviets have bolted two and three layers of reactive armor
boxes to their T-72 tanks _ a discovery members of the committee
made during their trip to the Soviet Union in August, said Rep. Les
Aspin, D-Wis.
   Reactive armor, unlike the traditional type of armor, goes
beyond merely protecting against an oncoming missile or projectile.
The reactive armor consists of a steel box that includes layers of
steel plates and explosives.
   The rationale for the reactive armor box is that a missile may
hit the box and set off the explosive inside but the steel plate
will block further damage.
   To combat the reactive armor boxes, the United States has
equipped its anti-tank weapons with dual-charge warheads. These
missiles include a first charge, which penetrates the box and sets
off the explosive, and a second charge, which, when it ignites a
fraction of a second later, can break through the steel plates and
penetrate the tank.
   The Soviet action makes it difficult for even a dual-charge
warhead to penetrate past the armor.
   ``This can't be anything but bad news to forces planning to
defend against these tanks with current anti-tank weapons,'' Aspin
said. ``At the same time, our anti-tank weapons should retain high
effectiveness against Soviet armored fighting vehicles, whose
numbers are being increased as tanks are withdrawn from Soviet
forces in Eastern Europe.''
   The Soviets have said they are withdrawing 5,300 tanks from
Eastern Europe while increasing the number of infantry fighting
vehicles, which are thinner-skinned, Aspin said.
   The committee plans to release a full assessment of the
U.S.-Soviet military balance later this month.

<HEAD>Study: Cutting Salt, Losing Weight Cuts Risk of High Blood Pressure</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   People in danger of developing high blood
pressure cut their risk in half in a new study by reducing salt and
alcohol intake, losing weight and exercising.
   It is the first study to show that such steps, often recommended
for people who already have high blood pressure, can also reduce
risk of developing the condition, said researcher Rose Stamler.
   The steps might prevent 1 million cases of high blood pressure
over five years in people 30 to 44, and perhaps additional cases in
other age groups, she said.
   Stamler, of Northwestern University Medical School in Chicago,
spoke in an interview before presenting the work at an American
Medical Association science reporters conference.
   The work also appears in Friday's issue of the Journal of the
American Medical Association.
   The research focused on 201 men and women, ages 30 to 44, whose
blood pressure was relatively high but within the normal range.
Such people are at risk of developing clinical high blood pressure.
   At the start of the study, in addition to high normal blood
pressure, the participants were overweight by at least 10 percent
or they had a fast pulse rate of 80 or more beats per minute.
   About half the group was assigned to an intervention program. It
included goals of reducing weight by about 10 pounds if they
needed, reducing salt intake to about half the national average,
limiting alcohol to two or fewer drinks a day, and exercising for
30 minutes at least three days a week.
   The other 99 participants were simply followed for the study's
duration of five years.
   After five years, 8.8 percent of participants who followed the
intervention program developed hypertension, compared to 19.2
percent among the others.
   Stamler said she did not think any one part of the intervention
program produced the difference, but rather the combination of
strategies. Weight loss seemed to be particularly effective,
however, she said.
   About 25 percent of the targeted group reached the 10-pound
weight loss mark, she said. In addition, average salt intake in the
intervention group dropped about 25 percent, and they consumed 30
percent less alcohol than before. Most also exercised more.
   Federal statistics say that the nation has at least 10 milion
people in the age group she studied who have the relatively high
but still normal blood pressures, she said.
   Her results suggest that without intervention, 2 million of them
would progress to high blood pressure within five years. But the
intervention program might prevent that in half the cases, she said.
   The results are ``very encouraging,'' said Edward D. Frolich,
chairman of the American Heart Association's Council for High Blood
Pressure Research.

<HEAD>CIA Official Predicts Soviet Reforms Will Continue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior CIA analyst said Monday that Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev might face a revolt among
rank-and-file Communist Party members, but that his reforms are
likely to survive a backlash.
   ``Even if there is a temporary setback, I think the process of
reform will continue,'' Marc Zlotnik of the CIA's Office of Soviet
Analysis said in a lecture at the Kennan Institute for Advanced
Russian Studies in Washington.
   His remarks reflected a general sense of uncertainty among
government and academic experts over the course of Soviet politics
in the short term after four years of often tumultuous reform since
Gorbachev came to power.
   Asked to comment on Gorbachev's own description of a deepening
economic and political crisis and reference to rumors of a
conservative coup in Moscow, Zlotnik said, ``Some spark could set
things off ... to topple the senior leadership. But no one is in a
position to predict when it will come and whether it can be put out
quickly.''
   ``The crisis is really serious,'' Zlotnik said. ``But so far, I
think it is being managed pretty well.''
   Gorbachev has solidified his position by eliminating
conservative opponents in the Communist Party and by strengthening
the role of the Soviet parliament, which this year elected him to a
five-year term as president.
   But the party and parliament may be on a collision course,
Zlotnik said, and ``at some point, there is going to be a showdown
between those who want a traditional role'' for the ruling
Communist Party, and members of parliament who put faith in
Gorbachev's call to transfer power from the party to the
legislature.
   Most parliamentary deputies are also party members, said
Zlotnik, and for at least the next several years they are likely to
obey any decision by the ruling Politburo to dump Gorbachev.
   Although Gorbachev so far has done a good job of ``keeping two
steps ahead'' of his rivals, said Zlotnik, ``I wonder whether any
politician can keep outguessing the opposition time after time.''
   Gorbachev, heeding a ``sense of panic'' in the party, has
recently taken a more moderate view, asking non-Russian
nationalities to curb their drives for independence and asking the
legislature to approve a 15-month ban on strikes that he says are
disrupting the economy and endangering reform.
   ``Gorbachev has seen the need to rein in the most radical
forces,'' Zlotnik said. ``I don't think he has changed his goals of
radically transforming Soviet society ... but he sees a need for
stocktaking,'' a respite from the frantic pace of the last four
years.

   Officials expect 100,000 Soviet Jews to come to
Israel in the next three to five years following a tightening of
U.S. visa requirements and have asked the United States to
guarantee $400 million to help house them.
   But plans to settle new immigrants in the Israeli-occupied
territories may jeopardize support from Washington, which views
Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip as an obstacle
to Middle East peace efforts.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Monday the Bush
administration would reject any request for aid to resettle
immigrants in the occupied lands.
   The West Bank and Gaza are home to 1.7 million Palestinians and
70,000 Jewish settlers. They are the scene of a 21-month-old
Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule.
   Israeli officials say more Soviet Jews will flock to the Jewish
state as a result of new U.S. immigration restrictions that make it
more difficult to go to the United States and because of worsening
economic conditions in their homeland.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's special adviser on Jewish
affairs, Yitzhak David, said one barometer of the interest in
emigration is the number of sponsorship offers sent to Israel's
diplomatic mission in Moscow at the behest of would-be emigrants.
   He said an average of 200 such invitations, needed to start
emigration procedures, are received daily. About 200,000 Soviet
Jews have requested sponsorship so far this year.
   Washington has set a ceiling of 50,000 Soviets to be admitted as
refugees next year. An additional 20,000 to 30,000 may enter the
country on a so-called parole basis with no government support.
   ``We do anticipate growing numbers of Jewish immigrants wanting
to settle in Israel,'' Fitzwater said. ``There may be costs
associated with that.''
   Simcha Dinitz, head of the quasi-governmental Jewish Agency,
which helps settle new arrivals, said 100,000 Soviets are expected
over the next three to five years. David said the number could
reach 150,000.
   Israel estimates resettlement costs at $3 billion over three to
five years and hopes to get $600 million in donations from U.S.
Jewish groups.
   It also wants $400 million in U.S-government guaranteed loans
that would allow it to borrow money from commercial banks at low
interest, Finance Ministry Spokesman Arieh Greenblatt said.
   The funding request was made by Finance Minister Shimon Peres,
who raised the issue with President Bush last week in New York, he
said.
   Fitzwater said Bush ``emphasized his symphathy for that problem
and committed to look into it'' but details were not discussed.
   The current American program of financing housing projects
limits loan guarantees to $25 million per country a year.
   Officials in Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc say Soviet Jews
should be settled in the occupied territories, which Likud sees as
an integral part of Israel.
   Housing Minister David Levy drew sharp criticism from American
officials and Jewish leaders when he first voiced the idea last
June. Liberal critics said it would deter Soviet Jews who do not
want to be thrust into the midst of the Palestinian uprising.
   Dinitz said the Jewish Agency would not allow its funds to be
used in the occupied territories.
   ``The Jewish Agency, the main body raising funds abroad, is
obliged by its policy to use all the funds for absorption in Israel
proper,'' he said. ``Whatever the government decides, it's
government's business, but Jewish Agency funds will be used only in
Israel.''
   David, the Shamir adviser, said Israel would settle Jews in the
West Bank and Gaza with or without U.S. backing.
   ``We are a sovereign state, and we think this immigration wave
should be directed there. If the Americans refuse to give money, we
shall take a loan from our own population, but we won't stop.''
   David said a group of settlement leaders was discussing the idea
with Shamir and that he was working on a survey of housing and job
opportunities in the West Bank and Gaza.
   Another controversial proposal by Israel's Absorption Minister
Yizthak Peretz calls for directing the majority of new immigrants
to development towns in remote areas of Israel.
   Jewish activists in Moscow say many Jews who seek to go to the
United States would rather stay in the Soviet Union than go to
Israel.
   Some 250,000 Soviet Jews emigrated to Israel between 1967 and
1988.
   Last year, 2,173 out of 18,961 Soviet Jewish emigrants came to
Israel, according to the Jerusalem-based Soviet Jewry Education and
Information Center. In January-August this year, 4,175 of the
34,610 Soviet Jewish emigrants came to Israel, and the government
expects a total of 7,000 in 1989.

   President Bush on Monday named Securities and
Exchange Commissioner Edward H. Fleischman as acting head of the
panel while the Senate ponders his first choice, White House aide
Richard C. Breeden.
   The designation of Fleischman as chairman was an interim action
and does not represent a backing away from Breeden's nomination,
said deputy White House press secretary Alixe Glen.
   The previous chairman, David S. Ruder, left the job on Friday to
return to teaching at Northwestern University's law school.
   Bush nominated Breeden, assistant to the president for issue
analysis and the White House point man on the recent savings and
loan restructuring bill, last August.
   However, the Senate has yet to act on the nomination. A
committee vote is expected later this month.
   Fleischman, 57, a former New York lawyer, has been a member of
the SEC since 1986.

   Ten families are offering their table
scraps, raked-up leaves and old newspapers to development of a city
garbage profile.
   Susan Young, a regional environmental planner, said the city has
little information on what, or how much, Tulsa residents are
tossing away, so families were enlisted for special garbage pickup
and analysis.
   ``The biggest problem we have in doing any kind of planning on
solid waste management is we don't have any information about how
much is out there,'' Ms. Young said.
   The families began Sunday to separate their trash into
categories, including yard clippings, plastics and paper. They will
continue the effort for a year.
   Ms. Young said the project will provide valuable statistics. The
goal is to find new ways to encourage recycling.
   ``Any estimate, plus or minus 100 percent, is so much better
than what we have now, which is sitting down with a cocktail napkin
and saying, `Well, how much (trash) did you have last month?' ''
Ms. Young said.

   A Republican lobbyist with former ties to the
White House told Congress Monday that he ``played by the rules'' in
obtaining lucrative federal housing subsidies. But the head of a
House panel charged he had reaped the benefits of ``a greased,
sweetheart deal.''
   Paul Manafort, a former campaign adviser to President Bush and
former President Reagan and a former business partner of Republican
National Chairman Lee Atwater, underwent hostile questioning from
disbelieving members of a House panel probing scandals at the
Department of Housing and Urban Development.
   Manafort, who three months ago acknowledged to the same panel
that his work amounted to ``influence peddling,'' denied being
given an advance tip by insiders at HUD to the availability of HUD
subsidies for renovating low-income housing projects, which were
prized profit-makers for developers.
   He said his lobbying firm ``has worked within the existing
system at HUD.''
   ``We played by the rules,'' Manafort said. ``I understand that
the subcommittee views the process as fundamentally flawed. I am
not here to argue with the subcommittee about the process, or to
defend it ...''
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., took sharp issue with Manafort's
description of a New Jersey housing project in which Manafort was a
partner, and which benefited from more than $31 million in federal
subsidies for renovation and tax credits.
   ``This was a greased, sweetheart deal, where all the
participants knew what the final outcome would be,'' said Lantos,
chairman of the House Government Operations subcommittee on
employment and housing.
   Manafort contended that partners in the development faced normal
business risks, including the potential loss of a $450,000
downpayment, in buying the 326 units of dilapidated housing and
putting together a package of subsidies and financing.
   But Lantos said HUD documents showed Manafort's group was
assured of the HUD subsidies in contacts with top agency officials
before it invested the money. Lantos said Manafort and his partners
also benefitted from HUD specifications that were written to
exclude other developers. He said it was ``ludicrious'' for
Manafort to claim he faced any normal business risk.
   Lantos produced HUD documents which he said showed Deborah Gore
Dean, former executive assistant to HUD Secretary Sam Pierce, was
passing along copies of HUD project proposals to Manafort even
though he was not directly involved in them.
   ``There was no risk here. There was a prearranged deal which
went through as it was prearranged,'' Lantos said.
   ``There was a sweetheart deal with Deborah Dean,'' Lantos said.
``Deborah Dean promised them the units (of subsidy) and she
delivered on the units. Those are the facts.''
   Dean is one of four former top officials of HUD, including
Pierce, who have refused to testify before the panel by invoking
their constitutional rights against self-incrimination. Dean has
been at the focus of the panel's probe into political favoritism in
the awarding of HUD subsidies to developers.
   In one 1986 memo released by the panel, Dean had written another
HUD official should amass ``great wells of power and wield it on my
behalf.'' Manafort said he did not recall receiving the HUD
documents, but said they involved a partner, Victor Cruse, whom he
had introduced to Dean.
   Laurence Gay, an associate in Manafort's lobbying firm,
testified he met with Dean and discussed the New Jersey project.
Another associate in the firm, Richard Davis, was a former White
House liason to HUD who said he had been in contact with Dean daily
while in government.
   Manafort faced questions about his failure in his appearance
last June to recall all the HUD-related projects on which he had
served as a consultant or lobbyist.
   Manafort said he and his lobbying firm, Black, Manafort, Stone
and Kelly, had failed to fully check all their records but had now
produced a complete list. Rep. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn., said that
involved 21 separate clients.
   Although he faced contentious questioning, Manafort was offered
reassurance by one of the panel members. Rep. Christopher Shays,
R-Conn., said, ``In no way have I ever seen anything related to
your activity that would suggest any illegalities.''
   Lantos, however, later told Manafort that ``your're trying to be
evasive,'' and that while his deal may not have broken laws `` ``it
certainly was highly questionable in terms of ethics.'' As a
result, Lantos said, money was denied to ``infintely more worthy
projects.''
   Lantos said subcommittee staff last week visited the Seabrook
project in Upper Deerfield, N.J., in which Manafort and Cruse are
partners. He described it as a ``slum'' with ``shocking''
conditions, including water-damaged apartments with no
refrigerators renting for more than $700 a month, including federal
subsidies.
   The panel questioned Cruse and Manafort at length about the
renovations and the failure so far to install gutters. Manafort
said that while 182 units are occupied, construction is still under
way and asserted, ``When we are finished with construction, we
believe the tenants will be happy.''

   The Supreme Court, embarking on a term laced
with controversial issues, said Monday it will decide whether
police nationwide may use sobriety checkpoints in trying to curb
drunken drivers.
   The case accepted by the court, which poses the question of
whether police officers may use checkpoints to spot drunken
drivers, presents the latest test of strength for the court's newly
solidified conservative majority.
   Michigan courts struck down that state's sobriety checkpoint
program as an unconstitutional invasion of privacy, but courts in
other states have upheld virtually identical police tactics.
   In its usual start-of-term flurry, the court issued orders in
more than 1,000 cases _ denying review to most and agreeing to
study 22. They will be among 150 or so disputes to be decided by
the end of the term in July.
   The court also heard arguments in a Yonkers, N.Y. desegregation
case centering on four city councilmen who voted against a judge's
order to pass a legislative package designed to lure subsidized
housing to the city's white neighborhoods.
   In addition to that civil rights case, the justices are looking
ahead to a term in which they have agreed to decide thorny
right-of-privacy arguments in three abortion disputes and the high
court's first ``right to die'' controversy.
   In other action on the first day of its term, the justices:
   _Agreed to decide in an Illinois case whether public employers
may be forced to put aside partisanship when hiring, promoting and
transferring employees.
   _Turned down the appeals of eight Mafia figures from New York
City convicted in the 1979 assassinations of crime chieftain
Carmine Galante and two of his associates.
   _Left intact Maryland's revocation of a $300,000-a-year tax
break for a men-only golf club that has counted presidents and
members of Congress among its members.
   _Refused to spare an evangelical Christian group in Lenox,
Mass., from having to return $5.5 million donated by a wealthy
ex-member.
   _Rejected Alaska's attempt to forestall offshore oil and gas
exploration in Bristol Bay. The state had argued that an oil spill
there could do more environmental harm than the massive Exxon
Valdez spill last March.
   _Allowed states to criminally prosecute employers accused of
neglecting the health and safety of their employees. The justices,
without comment, let stand a ruling in an Illinois case that
federal workplace regulations do not bar such state prosecutions.
   The use of police sobriety checkpoints in Michigan was attacked
shortly after state police began using them in 1986. The program
was modeled after one used in Maryland.
   At a checkpoint site, police directed all traffic headed in one
direction to a roadside area where officers checked motorists for
signs of intoxication.
   If there was no immediate evidence of intoxication, the motorist
was given a traffic safety brochure and allowed to drive away. The
average delay was about 30 seconds.
   If signs of intoxication were detected, a driver was directed to
another area for further questioning and perhaps a breath test.
   At one such checkpoint, Michigan state police troopers checked
126 vehicles in less than an hour and detained two drivers for
sobriety field tests. One driver was arrested on drunken-driving
charges.
   The state police department was sued soon after the checkpoint
program began. The lawsuit alleged that the checkpoints violated
the Fourth Amendment's ban on unreasonable police searches and
seizures.
   State courts banned the checkpoints, citing ``the potential for
an unreasonable, subjective intrusion on individual liberty
interests.''
   In defending the checkpoint program, Michigan Attorney General
Frank Kelley told the justices that fighting drunken driving is a
``grave and legitimate public interest.''
   He said Michigan's checkpoint program is valid even if it is not
the most effective police procedure available or may carry the
``potential of generating fear and surprise in some motorists.''
   Lawyers for those who successfully challenged the checkpoint
program urged the justices to reject the appeal.
   They said the ``warrantless, suspicionless seizure'' of a
vehicle at a sobriety checkpoint could lead to drivers and
passengers being required to get out and being subjected to
pat-down searches. They said police officers may use such occasions
to inspect a vehicle's contents.
   In other matters, the court:
   _Agreed to use a Florida case to decide whether states may
prohibit grand jury witnesses from making public their own
testimony once the investigation has ended.
   _Said it will decide whether the government may prohibit
soliciting on all Postal Service property, including the sidewalks
adjacent to post office buildings.
   _Left intact a $278,600 libel award against a Pawtucket, R.I.,
newspaper by refusing to review a ruling that news stories may be
libelous even if they contain no false statement.
   _Turned down the appeal of eight antiwar activists, including
Philip and Daniel Berrigan, who were convicted of breaking into a
King of Prussia, Pa., plant and damaging two nuclear missile cones.
   _Agreed to decide in a California case whether lawyers who take
civil rights cases on a contingency basis may collect a big chunk
of their clients' awards.
   _Let stand the trespassing convictions of three people who
attempted to hand out anti-abortion booklets to students outside a
Texas high school.
   On the same day last July that the justices expanded state
authority to make abortions harder to get, they also agreed to
study disputes over abortion regulation in Minnesota, Ohio and
Illinois.
   Laws in Minnesota and Ohio require doctors to notify parents of
unmarried minors who seek an abortion.
   An Illinois law would require abortion clinics, where the
overwhelming majority of abortions are performed, to provide
services and equipment now found only in hospitals. The law could
force many clinics out of business and drive up the cost of an
abortion by nearly $50.
   The court also will decide whether a life-sustaining tube may be
removed from the stomach of a Missouri woman in an irreversible
vegetative state.
   When Nancy Cruzan's parents requested that artificial feeding
and hydration be ended for their daughter, hospital officials
refused to do so without a court order. The Missouri Supreme Court
ruled that the Cruzans, who say Nancy would prefer to die, have no
right to order the termination of such treatment.

<HEAD>Voyager Catches Geyser-Like Volcano in the Act of Erupting on Triton</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS lead and 13th graf, ``Triton's eruptions,'' to CORRECT
ice to nitrogen ice or frozen nitrogen.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voyager 2 photographed an active geyser
or volcano blowing gaseous and frozen nitrogen 5 miles high on
Triton, proving Neptune's biggest moon is the solar system's third
object with active eruptions, scientists said Monday.
   ``We caught one in the act!'' said Ellis Miner, deputy Voyager
project scientist at the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   A NASA news release called the eruptions ``geyser-like
phenomenon.'' But with 5-mile-high plumes, they can be considered
either volcanoes or giant geysers, said Brad Smith, leader of
Voyager's photographic imaging team.
   Earth and Io, a moon of Jupiter, are the only other bodies in
the solar system known to have active volcanoes. Io's volcanoes
spew molten sulfur.
   Images radioed to Earth when Voyager flew past Neptune and
Triton in August showed dark, plume-shaped deposits of material
lying on Triton's south polar ice cap. At the time, scientists said
they believed the deposits were created by volcanoes spewing gas
and ice 12 to 20 miles skyward. They said they believed the
volcanoes were active or had been active in the past few hundred
years.
   But it wasn't until late last week that closer examination of
Aug. 24 pictures taken from a distance of 62,000 miles revealed an
eruption in progress, Miner said Monday.
   ``Resembling a smokestack, the narrow stem of the dark plume
rises vertically nearly 5 miles, forming a cloud that drifts 90
miles eastward in Triton's winds,'' NASA said in a stratement.
   NASA made the announcement as Voyager formally ended its
two-month close inspection of Neptune, the solar system's
fourth-largest planet. The one-ton space probe was 34.7 million
miles past Neptune, traveling at 37,337 mph. It was 2.83 billion
miles from Earth, and had traveled 4.46 billion miles on a curved
course since its launch in 1977. Voyager 2 explored Jupiter in
1979, Saturn in 1981 and Uranus in 1986.
   Voyager 2's encounter with Neptune formally started Aug. 5 and
it will continue to look back at the planet until December.
   But the formal end of the encounter was marked by the activation
Monday of a new set of computer commands replacing the program that
guided the craft and its cameras and instruments through the close
examination of Neptune.
   Voyager 2, like its twin Voyager 1, is expected to return
information to Earth for another 25 or 30 years before its
plutonium power generators fail. The probes will measure magnetic
fields and electrically charged particles in space. Voyager 1
explored Jupiter in 1979 and Saturn in 1980.
   The eruption isn't apparent in any single image of Triton, but
was ``recognized by examining several images taken from different
angles and analyzed through stereoscopic techniques,'' NASA said.
   Triton's eruptions are of nitrogen ice with nitrogen gas, Smith
said.
   ``It's a semantic issue'' whether to call them volcanoes or
giant geysers, Smith said. ``If we're talking about the materials
involved, it's closer to a geyser than a volcano. But if you're
talking about the mechanics involved _ shooting material miles
above the surface _ that's closer to a volcano.''
   Scientists don't know what causes the eruptions on Triton, the
coldest known object in the solar system with a surface temperature
of 400 degrees below zero Fahrenheit.
   ``One possibility being considered is that pressurized gas,
probably nitrogen, rises from beneath the surface and carries aloft
dark particles and possibly ice crystals,'' NASA said. ``Whatever
the cause, the plume takes the particles to an altitude where they
are left suspended to form a cloud that drifts.''
   Triton is about four-fifths the size of Earth's moon.
   Voyager 2 also discovered gargantuan storms and 720-mph wind in
Neptune's atmosphere, and six moons orbiting the planet in addition
to Triton and Nereid, which were detected from Earth. It also
discovered three thin rings and one broad band of dust orbiting the
planet.

<HEAD>Quayle: Administration May Seek Aid for Philippines' Internal Security</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle said Monday the
administration may ask Congress to let the Philippines use U.S.
foreign aid to bolster internal security against communist
insurgents.
   Two American military base workers were ambushed and killed by
communist rebels in the Philippines last Tuesda shortly before
Quayle's arrival.
   Quayle said a waiver of the restriction on using U.S. foreign
aid for internal security would ``help protect American lives.''
   Quayle, who returned Friday from a 12-day, four-nation Asian
tour, was instrumental in obtaining a similar waiver for El
Salvador earlier this year after he visited there.
   The Philippines is due to receive almost $650 million in U.S.
aid next year.
   Quayle did not say how much he felt should be reallocated toward
internal security, but aides said the country needs basic security
equipment including two-way radios for police cars in Manila to
help combat terrorism.
   In a luncheon interview with The Associated Press and other news
organizations, Quayle said that a long-term agreement to keep the
six American military installations in the Philippines would make
the country more attractive to foreign investors.
   ``The country needs economic development. You see that just upon
arrival, traveling the streets of Manila. You still have poverty at
a very significant degree,'' Quayle said.
   ``They need private investment. They need businesses to come
over there and invest,'' said Quayle, who also visited Japan, South
Korea and Malaysia.
   The base agreement, covering Clark Air Base, Subic Bay naval
station and four smaller installations, expires in September 1991,
and a dozen of the 23 members of the country's Senate favor closing
them. Vice President Salvador H. Laurel has suggested a 5-to-10
year extension of the lease agreement.
   But Quayle said he told Laurel a 5-to-10 year agreement ``means
we're leaving. I don't believe that that is what you really want if
you want to think of the long-term stability of the Philippines.''
   ``That's the question the Filipinos have to ask themselves,''
said Quayle, who reiterated that he believes ``the majority of the
people ... still support our presence.''
   ``I think we are a stabilizing force in the Philippines, and
stability is what investors and people look to.''
   On other issues, Quayle said:
   _The Soviets should not misconstrue the Bush administration's
continued support for a ``realistic'' Strategic Defense Initiative.
``If they view a phased deployment and a redefinition of SDI as a
lessening of the commitment, they're misreading the tea leaves.''
   _Shrugged off a question about his own low standing in public
opinion polls. ``I'm gratified for the president's good standing in
polls. That's my concern right now. I got plenty of time to worry
about my own,'' said the 44-year-old vice president.
   _The United States cannot support the ``puppet'' Cambodian
government installed by the Vietnamese. The main U.S. goal now in
the wake of the Vietnamese troop pullout is supporting the
non-communist resistance and trying to prevent the ``mass
murderers'' of the Khmer Rouge from returning to power, he said.
   _It will ``take time for China to recover'' following the
government massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators in Tianamen
Square.
   ``The problem is China continues to perceive that nothing
happened, or whatever happened is nobody's business, and therefore
it's for us to change, not them,'' said Quayle. That ``attitude''
must change, he added.
   _All three South Korean opposition leaders Quayle met with
``clearly support'' keeping the 43,000 U.S. troops stationed there.
``For us to pull the cord at this time would be very
counterproductive,'' said Quayle, who said democracy is clearly
emerging in South Korea.

<HEAD>Mitchell Tweaks Administration Over Aid To Poland</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell again
goaded the Bush administration Monday on its ``timidity'' in U.S.
policy toward Poland and said the Democratic Congress will press
ahead with additional aid for the new non-communist government.
   Mitchell, who met with top Polish officials last week, said the
new government led by members of the Solidarity trade union is
``firmly committed'' to establishing a more Western-style economy.
``The only question is whether the West will make it possible for
this transformation to succeed,'' he said in a floor speech.
   He noted that Bush has voiced support for new loans to Poland
through the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. But he said
those moves alone will not meet the country's immediate needs.
   ``It appears the administration remains hesitant to move forward
until Poland's economic reforms already are fully in place,'' said
Mitchell, D-Maine. ``In light of our great stake in the success of
the new Polish government, I believe this response is excessively
timid.''
   The comments were Mitchell's fourth public attack on Bush's
Poland policy in two weeks.
   ``Congress will do its best to ensure that the United States
does in fact play a leading role in encouraging the success of
Poland's brave experiment,'' he said, pointing to a three-year $1.2
billion aid package passed by the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee that dwarfs Bush's three-year, $119 million program of
economic development aid.
   ``I call upon the administration to abandon its timidity and to
take advantage of this historic opportunity to provide the kind of
help that is necessary for democracy and open government to succeed
in Poland,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   For the second straight month, Jewish
emigration from the Soviet Union reached an all-time high, a
spokesman for the National Conference on Soviet Jewry announced
Monday.
   In September, 8,442 Jews left the Soviet Union, up from the
previous monthly high set in August of 6,756 emigres. Before this
year, the previous high was set in October 1979, when 4,746
emigrated.
   At the current rate of emigration, ``we are within sight of
surpassing the benchmark year of 1979,'' when 51,320 Jews left the
Soviet Union, said Jerry Strober, a spokesman for the conference.
   The cumulative total this year is 41,886. Of last month's
emigres, 1,042 or 12.3 percent, went to Israel, the conference
announced.
   The group, which has been monitoring and lobbying for Jewish
emigration from the Soviet Union for two decades, repeated its call
for the Soviet parliament to pass legislation liberalizing
regulations for people seeking to leave.

<TEXT>
   Victims or families of victims of foreign
government-sponsored torture could sue for damages in U.S. district
courts under a bill passed Monday by the House.
   Approved on a 362-4 vote, the legislation extends to U.S.
citizens who have been tortured abroad the same civil redress now
available to foreign nationals tortured in the United States.
   ``This bill puts torturers on notice they will find no safe
haven in the United States,'' said Rep. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn.
   All of the four votes against the bill were cast by Republicans:
Reps. Joe Barton of Texas, Robert K. Dornan of California, Jon L.
Kyl and Bob Stump, both of Arizona.
   Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Texas, chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee, said the legislation was prompted in part because of a
ruling in 1985 by then-U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Robert
Bork.
   In a case involving alleged terrorist acts by the Palestine
Liberation Organization, Bork ruled that courts could hear such
suits having a possible impact on U.S. foreign relations only
through an explicit grant from Congress.
   The bill deals only with officially condoned acts of torture or
extrajudicial killings and does not touch upon acts of torture or
killings by private groups.

<TEXT>
   The first day of registration for
February's national election went smoothly and about 30 percent of
eligible voters signed up, a ranking international observer
reported Monday.
   Spokesmen for an opposition coalition, however, accused the
Sandinista government's electoral authorities of foot-dragging and
said about half its own representatives were not given credentials
to observe the registration.
   Joao Baena Soraes, secretary-general of the Organization of
American States, described the complaints as ``administrative'' and
said his organization's 52 observers throughout the country
reported about 570,000 of an estimated 1.9 million eligible voters
registered on Sunday, the first day.
   ``There was some (opposition) discussion of administrative
aspects, for example the delay in accrediting representatives and
the payment of the per diem, but ... everything proceeded
normally,'' he told reporters Monday. ``I did not verify any
obstacle or any complaint that could compromise the process.''
   Baena visited 35 registration centers Sunday in Managua, Leon,
Granada and in two villages.
   Voters are permitted to register at 4,394 centers on the first
four Sundays of October. General elections to be held Feb. 25 are
for a president and vice president, mayors and a 90-member National
Assembly.
   Publisher Violeta Barrios de Chamorro of the National Opposition
Union coalition is challenging President Daniel Ortega, who seeks
another term as candidate of the ruling leftist Sandinista party.
Eight other parties are contesting the presidential election.
   Ortega called early elections as part of regional accords with
the presidents of Honduras, Costa Rica, Guatemala and El Salvador
calling for demobilization of the Contras, U.S.-supported rebels
fighting the Sandinistas.
   Luis Sanchez, spokesman for the opposition alliance, told The
Associated Press registration was slow and about half the
opposition's representatives were not given credentials in time to
help supervising the process.
   He said the alliance would file a formal complaint with the
Supreme Electoral Council.
   Of seven Managua-area registration centers the AP visited
Sunday, the coalition was represented at only two. Other opposition
parties had observers at two of the remaining five and there were
no opposition observers at three.
   Observers from the Sandinista National Liberation Front were
present at all seven centers.
   An official said a registration center in Chontales province was
moved ``to a safer place'' five miles away because of armed men in
the area, presumably rebels. Ofiel Acuna, president of the regional
election council, said the center was in El Guarumo, 100 miles east
of Managua.
   There were no reports of Contra military activity on Sunday.
Most of the rebels are in jungle camps in Honduras, but a few
Contra groups remain in Nicaragua, including Chontales.
   A joint commission of the OAS and United Nations is charged with
supervising the demobilization and re-integration of the Contras
into civilian life.
   Baena said the necessary elements for fair elections appear to
be present. ``Generally, I believe that on Feb. 25 there will be
free and honest elections,'' he said.
   Thirty U.N. observers watched the registration Sunday but did
not comment.

   A federal judge acted within his powers by
fining four Yonkers, N.Y., city councilmen for disobeying his
desegregation order, a lawyer for the federal government told the
Supreme Court on Monday.
   But an attorney for the councilmen argued that the judge could
have changed the city zoning ordinance, but chose instead to
violate the councilmen's common-law right of legislative immunity,
as well as their constitutionally protected freedom of speech.
   The case, argued before the high court Monday, is an outgrowth
of the bitter, nine-year battle to desegregate Yonkers. The
justices are expected to rule by July.
   The case centers around four city councilmen _ Nicholas V.
Longo, Edward J. Fagan Jr., Peter Chema and Vice Mayor Henry
Spallone _ who voted against a judge's order to pass a legislative
package designed to lure subsidized housing to the city's white
neighborhoods.
   Kenneth W. Starr, the federal government's solicitor general,
praised U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand for not employing more
stringent tactics to compel the councilmen to obey his July 26,
1988, order.
   In 1985, Sand found Yonkers that had for 40 years deliberately
concentrated virtually all its subsidized housing in the southwest
part of the city to keep blacks away from whites. Sand ordered the
city to build 200 units of public housing in white neighborhoods in
1988 and to plan for 600 more. The city appealed, lost and seemed
close to agreeing on a desegregation plan until Yonkers residents
raised loud objections. The council defied Sand's order by voting
4-3 against the desegregation plan.
   Sand then set fines of $500 a day and threatened to jail the
four unless they obeyed his order.
   ``They simply chose not to obey, and furthermore, they said, `We
don't have to obey,''' Starr told the justices.
   Sand had also set fines for the city _ starting at $100 a day
and doubling daily until they reached $1 million daily _ prompting
Councilmen Chema and Longo to change their votes as Yonkers faced
imminent bankruptcy.
   The councilmen ultimately paid $3,500 apiece in fines; none went
to jail. Yonkers paid a total of $819,000 in fines, which were
upheld by the Supreme Court.
   James D. Harmon Jr., the attorney representing the councilmen,
argued Monday that the district court used ``the most intrusive
means'' available to compel the four to change their votes,
violating their legislative immunity. Harmon also argued that to
vote is to exercise one's freedom of speech, which is protected by
the First Amendment.
   ``Is this like the court ordering somebody to say something they
don't want to say?'' Justice Byron White asked Harmon at one point.
``Courts are always doing that.''
   White gave the example of courts ordering employers to post
notices they'd rather quash, and suggested Harmon could make his
argument without invoking the Constitution.
   Harmon also argued that there are limits to judicial authority,
and that the councilmen were compelled to vote their consciences.
This prompted Justice Anthony Kennedy to ask whether the councilmen
had the right to force the city into bankruptcy.
   ``Yes, and to be held accountable for that at the ballot box,''
Harmon said.
   The cases are Spallone vs. U.S., 88-854; Chema vs. U.S., 88-856;
and Longo vs. U.S., 88-870.

<HEAD>Legislative Battle Builds Over Development in the Desert</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers, miners, developers and
environmentalists clashed Monday over legislation that would
designate about 9.5 million acres of California land as wilderness
areas and national parks.
   ``We need to draw clear lines that development can work around
while saving some lands as parks and wildernesses,'' Sen. Alan
Cranston, D-Calif., sponsor of the measure, told a crowded hearing
conducted by the Senate Energy and Resources subcommittee on public
lands, national parks and forests.
   Congress in 1976 enacted the Federal Land Policy and Management
Act which established the California Desert Conservation Area. The
Bureau of Land Management, in accordance with the law, developed a
management plan for the California desert to balance the demands of
environmentalists, hunters, miners, ranchers, energy developers,
tourists and the military.
   But, according to Cranston, the Bureau of Land Management has
``failed to protect important desert resources.''
   Citing a report by the General Accounting Office, Cranston said
the investigative arm of Congress found that the bureau ``has
frequently allowed the needs of competing interests, such as
recreation and commercial use, to take precedence over wildlife
interests when conflicts have arisen.''
   The bureau disputed that charge.
   ``I wish the folks at GAO would have had both their eyes and
ears open when they did their report,'' said Cy Jamison, director
of the bureau. ``GAO's report presents only a partial picture of
BLM's wildlife activities in the California desert.''
   Jamison also criticized the legislation which appears driven by
the premise that public lands will be destroyed if they are not
designated as wilderness or placed in national parks.
   ``That is wrong and that mindset would gut the multiple use
philosophy mandated by Congress,'' Jamison said.
   Robert A. Sanregret, a representative of the Western Mining
Council, Inc., said the legislation ``would destroy thousands of
private businesses and would, literally, make thousands of citizens
homeless.''
   Sanregret argued the measure would lock out millions of acres of
public land for future use by mineral exploration and development.
   Recreationists complained that the legislation would close off
camping areas, hiking trails and rock collecting sites. Cranston
had noted that the bureau proposes permitting a motorcycle race
through a desert tortoise habitat during the Thanksgiving weekend
next month.
   The state has listed the desert tortoise as an endangered
species.
   The High Desert Cattlemans Association said the legislation
``will directly affect the livelihoods of the ranchers, the future
of desert ranching and the local economy.''

<HEAD>Court Agrees To Consider Use Of Undercover Agents To Gain Confessions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to consider
allowing the use of police undercover agents to elicit confessions
from jailed criminal suspects.
   The justices announced they will use the the case of an Illinois
murder suspect to consider weakening its famous 1966 Miranda ruling
that requires police to warn suspects of their right to an attorney
and to remain silent.
   An Illinois appeals court ruled last November that police
violated the rights of Lloyd Perkins when they planted an
undercover agent in jail to question him about a murder.
   Perkins was charged with fatally shooting Richard Stephenson on
Nov. 8, 1984, in Fairview Heights.
   Police lacked a suspect in the murder in 1986 when Donald
Charlton, an inmate at Graham Correctional Facility in Hillsboro,
told authorities he had information about the homicide.
   Police then placed Charlton and undercover narcotics officer
John Parisi in the Montgomery County Jail on March 31, 1986.
Perkins was being held there awaiting trial on a charge of
aggravated battery unrelated to the murder.
   Parisi, using the alias Vito Bianco, wore motorcycle garb and
told Perkins he was interested in planning an escape. Parisi,
Charlton and Perkins arranged to meet in the cellbock after the
other inmates went to sleep.
   At that meeting Parisi asked Perkins whether he had ever ``done
someone,'' a phrase the appeals court said was intended to elicit
information about any killings in which Perkins took part.
   The appeals court said Perkins then recounted in detail the
killing of Stephenson.
   Perkins then was taken to the county courthouse, placed under
arrest for murder and given his Miranda warnings.
   A state judge in 1987 ruled that Perkins' jailhouse statements
to Charlton and Parisi about the Stephenson killing could not be
admitted as evidence.
   State officials, seeking to have the statements admitted, said
the Miranda ruling is designed to protect suspects against police
coercion.
   The officials said since Parisi and Charlton had engaged in
friendly conversation pretending to enlist Perkins in a jailbreak,
there could be no coercion.
   But the Illinois appeals court said the Miranda ruling applies
whenever a suspect is in custody, ``even when the purpose of the
custody is unrelated to the purpose of the interrogation.''
   The Supreme Court in 1980 ruled that law enforcement officials
cannot hire jailhouse informants to induce criminal defendants in
custody to make incriminating statements.
   The justices in that ruling relied on their own 1964 decision _
handed down two years before Miranda _ that barred government
agents from eliciting incriminating information from defendants
entitled to a lawyer's help during interrogation.
   Illinois officials said the 1980 high court ruling permits
Parisi's questioning of Perkins because no murder charges against
Perkins had been filed.
   Under such circumstances, the state said, ``there exists no
inherent danger that a suspect will believe he has no choice but to
submit to (police) will and to confess.''
   The case is Illinois vs. Perkins, 88-1972.

<HEAD>Supreme Court to Review Federal Crime Victims Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court agreed Monday to review a
law requiring people convicted of federal crimes to pay money to
help crime victims.
   The court said it will study a ruling that the law is
unconstitutional because it is a revenue-raising measure that
originated in the U.S. Senate rather than the House of
Representatives. The Constitution requires that revenue-raising
measures start in the House.
   The Bush administration is seeking to have the appeals court
ruling reversed.
   The case stems from a $50 ``assessment'' against German
Munoz-Flores, convicted of helping an illegal alien evade
inspection by immigration officials in San Diego County, Calif.
Munoz-Flores also was placed on probation for two years.
   The assessment was ordered under a 1984 law aimed at raising
money to offset the cost of helping victims of crimes.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last December that
the law is a revenue-raising measure that should have originated in
the House rather than the Senate.
   The appeals court's ruling is binding in Arizona, Alaska,
California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon and Washington.
   Justice Department lawyers said the ruling invalidates
assessments imposed against thousands of people convicted in those
states. The government's appeal said that the 9th Circuit's ruling,
if adopted nationwide, would affect tens of thousands of criminal
cases each year.
   Government lawyers argued that the 1984 law is not primarily
designed to raise revenue, but rather was part of a package to help
crime victims. The lawyers also said the assessments measure is
designed in part to punish those convicted of crimes.
   The appeal said the appeals court was mistaken in describing the
measure as originating in the Senate because it actually originated
in the House, which passed a crime-control bill that included the
assessments feature.
   The law calls for assessments ranging from $25 to $200 per
offense.
   The case is U.S. vs. Munoz-Flores, 88-1932.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir does not intend
to alter his Palestinian peace plan despite pressure from the
United States, Egypt and the rival Labor Party, his aides said
Monday.
   ``Only five months have passed'' since Shamir presented his plan
for elections as a first step toward negotiations and ``the prime
minister does not see any reason to change it,'' spokesman Yossi
Ahimeir said.
   Egyptian, Israeli and U.S. officials have been meeting in New
York and Israel's governing coalition _ Shamir's rightist Likud
bloc and the center-left Labor Party _ is preparing to debate
Mubarak's efforts to bring Palestinians and Israelis together in
preliminary talks.
   At the United Nations in New York, Foreign Minister Marwan Kasim
of Jordan urged the United States, Soviet Union and others to
persuade Israel to talk with the Palestine Liberation Organization
and move ``out of the circle of violence and oppression ... into a
state of security, stability and constructiveness.''
   The Cabinet leadership, including Likud and Labor ministers, is
to meet Thursday about Mubarak's ideas.
   Likud rejects a formula backed by Egypt and the United States
that involves trading occupied land for peace and including people
deported by Israel in a Palestinian negotiating delegation. Labor,
led by Finance Minister Shimon Peres, supports both ideas.
   Shamir's proposed elections would choose delegates to negotiate
with Israel about interim autonomy in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
occupied by Israel since the 1967 Middle East war.
   Mubarak raised the land-for-peace proposal after many
Palestinians dismissed Shamir's plan as an effort to end the
uprising against Israeli occupation that began Dec. 8, 1987.
   At Tammun village in the West Bank, Mahmud Hamed Bani Awde, 22,
was stabbed to death Monday for reasons not immediately clear.
   The Israeli army said the killing was a family matter and was
under police investigation, but the national news agency Itim and
Arab reporters said Awde belonged to the Democratic Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, a Marxist group, and the murder may have
been political.
   In the Gaza Strip, a soldier was slightly injured Monday by a
rock thrown by Palestinians in the Jabaliya refugee camp, the army
said.
   Elsewhere in the occupied lands, Arab hospital officials
reported 11 Palestinians wounded by army gunfire, including a
15-year-old boy hospitalized in Israel with a critical head wound.
   Shops in Nablus and Bethlehem closed Monday to protest the
shooting deaths of two Palestinians youths the previous day, Arab
reports said.
   Israeli soldiers or civilians have killed at least 581
Palestinians in the uprising, and 123 Palestinians have been slain
by fellow Arabs, most as suspected collaborators with Israel. Forty
Israelis have died in the violence.
   Mubarak telephoned Shamir on Friday to talk about his proposals.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III issued a veiled threat to
drop support for the election plan unless Israel moved toward the
proposals made by Egypt, the only Arab country to have made peace
with Egypt.
   Baker said last week the United States would ``have to go back
to the drawing board'' on plans for Middle East peace if Israel
rejected Mubarak's ideas.
   Avi Pazner, another Shamir aide, said Israel did not see Baker's
comment as a threat but added that the government would not bow to
U.S. pressure.
   ``Everybody knows you can't twist Israel's arm when you want to
get something,'' he told The Associated Press in a telephone
interview.
   Yossi Ben-Aharon, director of Shamir's office, said including
deported Palestinians in a negotiating team was a ploy to sneak the
Palestine Liberation Organization, which Israel defines as a
terrorist group, into the peace process.
   Peres, the Labor Party leader, noted that Mubarak did not
mention two Arab demands Israel has found most objectionable: a
direct role for the PLO and creation of a Palestinian state.
   He criticized what he called Shamir's effort to create ``a new
Palestinian people'' who agreed with Israel on all points.
   ``The opinions of the Palestinians, the sentiments of the
Palestinians ... must be known not only by every Israeli, but to
every Israeli politician,'' he said on television. ``We must
negotiate with people who do not agree with us.''

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A flood of potent Mexican black tar heroin
washed across San Francisco over the weekend, killing three users
and sending dozens to hospitals with injuries ranging from broken
bones to brain damage.
   ``Black tar heroin is pretty potent stuff anyway,'' said police
Inspector Sam Osborne. He said the drug normally sold on the street
is 5 to 9 percent pure. ``What we think is somebody forgot to cut
it somewhere along the line.''
   Between Friday and Monday morning, three people died in San
Francisco and 54 others were treated for overdoses after they shot
up the gooey black drug.
   Some users were unconscious and unable to breathe when reached
by paramedics who administered an antidote called Nalaxone.
Overdose cases were reaching San Francisco General and a few
private hospitals at the rate of one an hour, compared with the
usual heroin overdose rate of one or two a day, authorities said.
   The fatalities were said to be men aged 35, 41 and 43. The
coroner's office was not releasing their names on Monday.
   At the Haight-Ashbury Free Clinic, Medical Director Dr. Alex
Stalcup said the latest overdoses were the worst since a ``similar
wave of overdoses and deaths'' in March 1987 that involved black
tar mixed with fentanyl, a pharmaceutical compound that can be
1,000 times more powerful than heroin. It is used by
anesthesiologists and redirected illicitly.
   Stalcup speculated that the same thing may have happened in the
recent overdoses. Introduction of fentanyl into the drug scene
several years ago resulted in a sudden rash of even more deaths, he
said. Today it's often mixed with an adulterant and sold as China
White, he added.
   Black tar has become the most commonly used heroin by San
Francisco's estimated 15,000 to 18,000 addicts since coming on the
scene about seven years ago, Stalcup said. It sells for about $20 a
bag that can be broken into several shots.
   Stalcup attributed its popularity to the ease of bringing it
into the country in ``body pack'' _ bags attached to one's body _
compared with the difficulties of smuggling so-called China White
from Asia.
   A 35-year-old musician who spoke with The San Francisco Examiner
while recovering at San Francisco General said he uses heroin about
once a week.
   ``It hit me good. Real good,'' he said. ``I remember telling my
friends that it almost was too good. I sat back to enjoy it and
just nodded off. Next thing I was waking up here.''
   While San Francisco police pursued leads from overdose victims,
Oakland police seized 4 pounds of black tar heroin worth about $2
million, and arrested five people in their largest heroin bust in
more than 10 years.
   Last week, federal Drug Enforcement Administration agents seized
2 kilos of black tar heroin at hotels near San Francisco
International Airport.

<HEAD>Heiress' Claim for Return of $5.5 million Upheld</HEAD>
<HEAD>Wth AM-Supreme Court Rdp Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LENOX, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An heiress who donated $6.5 million to an
evangelical Christian group won a battle to recover most of the
money Monday when the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the
group's appeal of an order to repay her.
   ``I'm thrilled,'' said department store heiress Elizabeth Dayton
Dovydenas. ``I think this decision shows that the Supreme Court
does not protect bogus preachers.''
   The court, without comment, let stand rulings that the group,
The Bible Speaks, received the donations after exerting undue
influence on Mrs. Dovydenas.
   ``A lot of aspects of it aren't over yet, but this was the
biggest part,'' she said.
   Mrs. Dovydenas joined The Bible Speaks in 1982. Within three
years, she donated more than $6.5 million _ including contributions
of $5 million, $1 million and $500,000.
   Mrs. Dovydenas' family in late 1985 hired two ``deprogrammers''
to talk to her. She later left The Bible Speaks, and sued to have
her gifts returned.
   The case was first heard in U.S. Bankruptcy Court after the
church petitioned for Chapter 11 protection maintaining that Mrs.
Dovydenas' lawsuit could force it into insolvency. A judge ruled in
her behalf and a trustee was appointed. The 1st U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals upheld her claim to only $5.5 million, saying the other
$1 million had been donated in good faith.
   The appeal acted on Monday challenged only that portion of the
appeals court decision concerning the $5 million in gifts.
   At issue was whether allowing Mrs. Dovydenas to rescind her
gifts violated the The Bible Speaks' religious freedom.
   Attorneys for The Bible Speaks had argued that Mrs. Dovydenas'
money was used for the purposes she specified, including the
construction of a new chapel, a swimming pool and other
improvements at the church's headquarters. They maintained the
lower court rulings threaten all religious groups. ``But they are
of especially grave concern to evangelical and fundamentalist
religious communities.''
   Church leaders have since abandoned the former prep school in
Lenox that had served as the church's headquarters. The former
pastor now works in Baltimore for a group called ``The Greater
Grace.''
   ``I am very disappointed that the Supreme Court has chosen not
to grant our petition to hear this case. There were many issues
involved that should have been addressed, and now they will
obviously go unanswered,'' Carl Stevens, founder of both groups,
said in a statement issued through a spokesman.
   Mrs. Dovydenas, who acquired the Lenox headquarters at a
bankruptcy auction for a fraction of her claim while the case was
under appeal, said she now plans to sell the property.
   Mrs. Dovydenas, an heir to the Dayton-Hudson fortune, grew up in
Minnesota. Some years ago, after moving to Lenox in 1981 with her
husband, she assessed her personal wealth at about $19 million.

<HEAD>Hungary Rejects Reported Romanian Proposal to Intervene in Poland</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Hungarian Communist Party has
rejected a proposal by Romanian President Nicolae Ceausescu for
Warsaw Pact intervention to prevent formation of Poland's new
government led by non-Communists, an official said Monday.
   Geza Kotai, the Communist Party's secretary in charge of
international affairs, made the remark in an interview with the
party newspaper Nepszabadsag. He was confirming reports published
in a Polish newspaper that said the Hungarian Communist Party had
received such a proposal from Romania's Communist Party.
   A pro-Solidarity Polish newspaper, Gazeta Wyborcza, published
articles Friday saying Ceausescu had summoned the Polish ambassador
in August to complain about the planned formation of a
Solidarity-led government in Poland.
   It said Ceausescu had decided to turn to the leaders of the
Warsaw Pact to ``jointly act in favor of preventing a serious
situation in Poland, in favor of defending socialism and the Polish
nation.''
   The report did not say if Ceausescu had made such an appeal to
other members of the Warsaw Pact, a seven-nation military alliance
led by the Soviet Union.
   But Kotai said the Hungarian Communist Party had received a call
for intervention ``and we gave a definite rejection.''
   Nepszabadsag quoted Kotai as saying, ``In present day Europe,
the fate of a nation is decided by the majority of the society in
that country, and not by a single party''
   Last month, Solidarity journalist Tadeusz Mazowiecki became the
leader of the Polish government _ the first non-Communist prime
minister in the Soviet bloc.
   Hungary's Communist Party, among the most liberal in the East
bloc, has agreed to hold free elections by June and has said it
would surrender power if it loses and join the opposition.
   ``We categorically reject the idea of any interference here, and
the Warsaw Treaty can give no grounds for such action,'' Kotai told
the newspaper.
   At recent Warsaw Pact meetings, the members expressed the stand
of non-interference in each others' internal affairs.

   A West German diplomat rescued an
East German grabbed by a policeman Monday as he tried to scale a
fence into Bonn's mission. However, most Czechoslovak police
relaxed their controls, letting hundreds more refugees enter the
compound as a new diplomatic dispute built up over the issue.
   East German refugees inside the embassy said they numbered more
than 2,000 by late Monday and more than 100 additional refugees
were arriving hourly.
   In a formal protest delivered to West German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's office, East German envoy Horst Neubauer said his government
demanded that the new refugees be ``turned out of the embassy and
returned to East Germany.''
   The latest rush came after 7,000 East Germans were allowed to
leave West German embassies in Prague and Warsaw over the weekend
for West Germany.
   More than 32,000 East Germans have arrived in West Germany since
Sept. 10, when Hungary opened its western border with Austria and
the numbers of refugees occupying Bonn's embassies swelled.
   On Monday, both East Germany and Czechoslovakia accused West
Germany of breaking its word by harboring new refugees, going back
on conditions it agreed to in gaining release of the earlier
refugee throng.
   Kohl spokesman Hans Klein denied any such agreement. And Peter
Rothen, a spokesman for the Bonn Foreign Ministry, insisted West
Germany ``never told the East Germans it would stop taking in East
Germans seeking refuge.''
   West German officials said they would press East Berlin to let
the new arrivals leave for the West.
   Czechoslovak police continued patrols outside the embassy Monday
but relaxed controls on pedestrians and drivers, witnesses reported.
   Nearly 10,000 people marched through Leipzig, East Germany, on
Monday, demanding legalization of opposition groups and adoption of
democratic reforms. It was the largest mass opposition
demonstration since 1953, when workers rose throughout East Germany
in an ill-fated uprising later crushed by Soviet tanks.
   In Warsaw, Poland, an estimated 100-200 refugees had arrived at
the West German Embassy. About 800 left the embassy Sunday for West
Germany.
   Bonn officials said Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze was instrumental in winning the release of East German
refugees and that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was in
touch with Bonn on the matter.
   East German opposition groups criticized their government's
approval of the exodus, declaring in a statement that East Germany
was ``losing a village every day.'' It said reforms were the only
``reasonable'' solution.
   More than 120,000 East Germans have reached West Germany so far
this year, including those who left legally and illegally.
   Police at the embassy in Prague were alternately harsh and
lenient.
   An East German man about 30 years old was seen climbing the
fence to the embassy. A policeman hung on, exerting all his weight
to bring the climber down. Refugees inside the fence clung to the
man and shouted for help.
   A diplomat ran outside the fence and put his arm around the
refugee.
   They walked away, ringed by police and reporters. A policeman
pointed to an East German handcuffed to a park bench. The diplomat
arranged for the East German to be freed, then led both men into
the embassy.
   Refugees said Czechoslovak officers patrolled the embassy area
with dogs during the night. A 26-year-old woman said she, her child
and her husband were dragged away from the embassy fence during the
night, kicked and beaten by police.
   Later, she said, three other policemen helped the family and
showed them the way to the mission's entrance, where they and
others were admitted.
   Some refugees said East Germans caught by police were detained,
then released elsewhere.
   Inside the embassy garden, studded with tents that sheltered
those who left over the weekend, refugees got assistance for
newcomers and helped others over the fence, witnesses reported.
   More East Germans, however, were reported crossing the border
from Czechoslovakia to communist Hungary and entering Austria from
Hungary.
   Hungary's official news agency, MTI, said 2,880 people entered
Hungary from Czechoslovakia over the weekend, most of them East
Germans. It said 24 people swam the Danube between Rajka and
Esztergom to cross into Austria.
   Newly arrived East Germans at the Giessen, West Germany, refugee
reception center said Monday they had been prepared to stay
indefinitely in Bonn's mud-filled embassy in Prague rather than
return home.
   ``I would have never gone back to East Germany, this was it,''
said Heinz Schmidt, a railway worker from Magdeburg who spent eight
days in a tent with his wife and teen-age son.
   He said the family never applied for permission to emigrate
legally because certain harassment would follow.
   ``You can lose your job ... Once you apply, you will be
interrogated by the security police, and soon you can drop out of
sight,'' Schmidt said.
   Lutz Gillert said he was demoted from chief doctor in a hospital
near Magdeburg after applying to leave five years ago and his son,
an excellent scholar, was rejected when he tried to enter a
university.
   ``The officials made no secret of the reason _ they told us in
writing it was because we wanted to emigrate,'' Gillert said.
   Several refugees at the Bonn embassy in Warsaw emphasized their
material situation was quite good in East Germany, but their lives
were constricted.
   ``I am not poor,'' said a 24-year-old civil engineer, who spoke
on conditoin of anonymity. ``But I have no future. We see no chance
for change. We have no trouble with eating and drinking, but we
have our limits.''

<TEXT>
   Converting an abandoned, 28-building
factory into a $77.5 million contemporary art museum could
revitalize this remote milltown, consultants said Monday.
   A commission is working on such a museum, but critics question
whether art lovers would drive to North Adams _ three hours
northwest of Boston, four hours from New York _ for the stark
enticements of contemporary art.
   Backers of the so-called Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary
Art want to use a plant complex abandoned in 1984 by the town's
largest employer, Sprague Electric. They want to convert the vast,
grimy plant into rooms of unique environmental works or sculptures.
   Sprague employed more than 1,000 people before relocating to
Connecticut. A draft of the consultants' feasibility study projects
the museum could employ 640 people in the town of 16,000 people
where unemployment is about 4 percent.
   Consultants hired by the commission project as many as 150,000
people would visit the museum in a year, pumping $22 million into
the region's economy.
   ``The sheer reality of marketing this museum will depend in a
certain extent to a creative approach,'' said Dennis Bidwell, one
of the consultants.
   The idea of turning the complex of 28 buildings into 350,000
square feet of gallery space was devised by Thomas Krens, former
director of the Williams College Art Museum in the Berkshires.
Shortly after launching the project, Krens was named director of
the Guggenheim Museum in New York.
   Plans for the museum call for an accompanying restaurant and
luxury condominiums selling at $160,000 to $250,000.
   ``The project will work,'' Don Bonz, another of the consultants,
told the commission Monday during review of the draft study.
   The commission is looking for $35 million from the state, spread
over four or five years. The remaining $44.5 million would come
from private donations.
   Members of the commission did not take final action on
feasibility of the project. They endorsed the draft study and
scheduled a presentation to the state Dec. 11.

   The Texas Supreme Court found ``glaring
disparities'' etween the state's rich and poor school districts and
ruled Monday that funding within the nation's second-largest system
is unconstitutional.
   Spending varies by as much as $17,000 per pupil per year from
rich to poor districts, the court found.
   ``A remedy is long overdue,'' Justice Oscar Mauzy's opinion
said. ``The Legislature must take immediate action.''
   The 9-0 ruling could have enormous financial and social
implications for the 3.3 million-student Texas school system,
second in size to California's.
   The court found the public school finance system violates the
113-year-old constitutional provision for an ``efficient system''
of public schools. It set a May 1, 1990, deadline for legislators
to find a solution.
   State attorneys had argued that the word ``efficient'' was
intended to suggest a `simple and inexpensive system.'''
   But the court said, ``The state's school financing system is
neither financially efficient, nor efficient in the sense of
providing for a `general diffusion of knowledge' statewide.
   ``It must be recognized that the constitution requires an
`efficient,' not an `economical,' `inexpensive,' or `cheap'
system,'' Mauzy said.
   ``A Band-Aid will not suffice; the system itself must be
changed,'' the court warned.
   Gov. Bill Clements said he will call for a special 30-day
session of the Legislature in the spring.
   Nearly $10 billion in state money will be made available for
public schools in 1990-91, and almost $12 billion is expected to
come from local districts.
   A state district judge in Austin ruled the school funding system
was unconstitutional in a case brought by school districts with low
property values against the state education commissioner and
others. That ruling was overturned last December by a 2-1 vote of
the Austin-based 3rd Court of Appeals.
   The lawsuit, known as Edgewood vs. Kirby, was filed in 1984.
Public schools are funded largely through a combination of local
property taxes and state aid. The federal government also
contributes.
   Because of the disparities in district property wealth, annual
spending per student ranges from $2,112 to $19,333, the high court
said without placing an exact date for the figures.
   The case got its title from the lead plaintiff, Edgewood
Independent School District in San Antonio, and lead defendant,
William Kirby, education commissioner.
   Edgewood Superintendent James Vasquez led about 1,800 students
and teachers in a celebration rally Monday. The high school's
marching band played and students waved banners with sayings like
``Victory'' and ``Edgewood All the Way.'' A marquee at the
stadium's entrance read ``Texas Children 9, Kirby 0.''
   ``Today we can begin to say we're no longer the poorest school
district in Texas _ we're the toughest,'' Vasquez told cheering
students and teachers. ``We took on the state of Texas and we beat
'em.''
   Also attending the gathering was Demetrio Rodriguez, who
launched the fight for equal school funding in 1968 when he and
other Edgewood parents filed a lawsuit that reached the U.S.
Supreme Court in 1973 but was defeated.
   ``This is a big day for me and my family,'' said Rodriguez, who
has four children who graduated from the Edgewood district and one
who is a high school senior. ``I cried this morning because it
really is something that has been in my heart,'' Rodriguez said,
his voice cracking with emotion.
   In Dallas, education commissioner Kirby said, ``As the lead
defendant in this case, I have been required to defend the
constitutionality of the system. But I have always maintained that
it is not adequate and have pressed for additional amounts of money
to improve equity.
   ``Now that the Supreme Court has ruled the system
unconstitutional, the Legislature must create a system that is
constitutional and that provides adequate funding to ensure a high
quality education for all children in the state,'' Kirby said.
   Olivia ``Ollie'' Besteiro, president of the Texas State Teachers
Association, said, ``History will mark this day as the opening of
the door to opportunity for tens of thousands, even millions, of
children.
   ``These children have been the victims of `segregated'
opportunity determined by a geographical roll of the dice.''
   Similar rulings have been issued in other states. The Kentucky
Supreme Court in June ordered an overhaul of that state's schools.

   World chess champion Garri Kasparov
of the Soviet Union won the 13th annual Interpolis chess tournament
Monday with a record score of 12 points in 14 matches.
   Viktor Korchnoi, a Soviet exile who lives in Switzerland,
finished second.
   First prize in the $50,000 event was $12,000. Kasparov's
performance in this southern Dutch city also gave him to 2,795
points for the year on the World Chess Federation's international
ranking list, surpassing the record 2,785 earned by former champion
Bobby Fischer in 1972.
   The win at Tilburg, where the maximum possible score was 14,
extends an undefeated string for the 26-year-old Soviet grandmaster
that began in 1981. He does not plan to enter any more tournaments
this year.
   Korchnoi, 58, compiled 8{ points in the tournament and won
$8,000 for his second-place finish.

   The opposition Labor Party abandoned
its controversial policy of unilateral nuclear disarmament Monday,
overturning the vote-losing doctrine at its annual conference.
   It also approved a motion urging Israel to begin a dialogue with
the Palestine Liberation Organization and called the Palestinian
uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip a ``just
revolt.''
   Israel refuses to negotiate with the PLO, which it describes as
a terrorist group bent on destroying the Jewish state.
   The motion said that, since Israel seized the territories in the
1967 Middle East war, ``the Israeli military occupation has
prevented the Palestinians from living under their own chosen form
of government and enjoying civil and political rights.''
   Delegates reaffirmed previous party positions backing the right
of both Palestinians and Israelis to states with internationally
recognized borders and calling the PLO the only legitimate
representative of the Palestinians.
   It referred to the 21-month-old uprising in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip as ``the just revolt of the Palestinian people calling
for an end to the `iron fist' policy of the Israeli military ...
and a withdrawal from the occupied territories.''
   After sometimes heated debate, delegates voted for a policy that
commits a Labor Party government to give up Britain's nuclear
arsenal only as part of a negotiated arms deal.
   Dismayed left wingers hung peace symbols from balconies in the
conference hall as speakers warned that the socialist movement must
change or suffer a fourth successive election defeat by
Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   ``It puts us in a very strong position to argue for an effective
and realistic initiative and to get verifiable (nuclear arms)
agreements,'' party leader Neil Kinnock said after the vote on the
first full day of the weeklong conference.
   Delegates at the convention in this south England resort cast
votes totaling 3.6 million to 2.4 million to ditch unilateral
nuclear disarmament after leaders of big, moderate trade unions
swung behind Kinnock.
   There are 1,500 conference delegates but the votes are counted
in the millions because the leaders of trade union that control 90
percent of the voting power cast blocks of tens of thousands of
votes based on the memberships of their unions.
   In a victory for party leftists, the conference voted by a 4-2
margin for a Labor government to cut defense expenditures by
one-fourth, bringing it in line with the average in other West
European members of NATO.
   Under the new policy, a Labor government would retain Britain's
submarine-launched Polaris nuclear missiles. It would also stick to
Mrs. Thatcher's decision to replace them in the early 1990s with
U.S. Trident missiles, which are nine times more powerful than
Polaris missiles.
   Legislator Tony Benn, a former energy secretary and doyen of the
Labor left, accused the party of betraying ``the basis of our whole
policy.''
   ``Britain does not need nuclear weapons. There is no Soviet
nuclear threat. That is the challenge we cannot ignore,'' declared
Benn to cheers from sections of the conference hall.
   A succession of speakers cited strides in superpower arms
control negotiations since Soviet leader Mikhail s. Gorbachev took
office, and they said a new Labor policy suited the improved
East-West relations.
   But others argued simply that Labor must change to win.
   ``We know it is the policy which is at fault, not the
presentation,'' said delegate Sylvia Heal. ``The leadership has
been accused of betrayal. But the people who will be guilty of
betrayal are those who by their actions ensure Thatcher's return
for another term.''
   Labor adopted its policy on nuclear weapons in 1981 as the party
lurched left after losing power to Mrs. Thatcher two years
previously.
   Polls show the policy was a major factor in Labor's two
subsequent defeats by Mrs. Thatcher in 1983 and 1987. She must call
the next election by mid-1992.
   Dropping the non-nuclear doctrine was part of a major new policy
platform aimed at shifting the party toward the center. The
conference is to vote on the changes, the result of a two-year
review, through the week.

   The Sony Walkman, the Dictaphone and the
Braun coffeemaker were successful industrial designs that are the
focus of designers gathered to look for an edge on products of the
future.
   Those products succeeded because their companies took their
industrial designers seriously, said Earl Powell, director of the
Design Management Institute of Boston, which is conducting a
four-day symposium with the Harvard Business School.
   Most business managers say they use engineers or others to
create a product, and ``then get the flakes to get the color picked
out,'' Powell said.
   Powell, one of those ``flakes'' by training, said designers can
be the consumer's advocate inside the firm, choosing the right size
knobs and switches that can make a product work easily or not.
   Yamaha Corp., which had an electronic saxaphone in the exhibit,
used its designers to find a modern shape that would match the new
technology of digital wind music.
   The first design was described by one Yamaha worker as a ``snake
that ate a lunch box.'' Several versions later, the final product
resembles a futuristic rifle. Embellished with the standard finger
pads in black, the instrument is a long black tube, bent down at
one end for the mouthpiece.
   The sound that emerges from the instrument can range from
synthesized voices to the acoustic timbres of wind instruments. The
product dominates the professional wind digital music market,
according to Yamaha.
   Designers at AB Bahco Vertyg, the tools division of The
Investment AB Bahco of Sweden, helped the company maintain its
share in the screwdriver market, while increasing its profit margin
by 20 percent, said Powell.
   The company had discovered in market research that carpenters
use a two-handed grip 70 percent of the time, and gave the problem
to its designers.
   The new screwdriver, which was presented at the exhibit, is
shaped like the numeral 8, with textured polypropylene where the
handle widens.
   At Braun, business managers faced the problem of an extremely
low share of the coffeemaker market. The KF20 model, introduced in
1972, had won awards for its simple, cylindrical design, but it was
too expensive.
   ``Artists and designers would collect our things to add to their
collections, but we were not succesful,'' said Dieter Rems, the
company's chief designer, who spoke at the symposium Monday.
   The solution, which included cheaper materials and fewer parts,
may not seem that innovative at first glance. But Rems said the new
design, marketed as the KF40, used one heater for both coffee and
water instead of two, which cut the price dramatically.
   More than 2.5 million units of the new design sold in 1988,
giving Braun a 12 percent market share. The company makes 12,000
units a day.
   Rems said having the designers talk to the manufacturers was a
crucial element in the Braun story, because the design could be
adapted to cut production costs.
   Powell said he thinks if American businesses adopted more of
these tactics, the competitiveness of U.S. products would improve
vastly.
   Designers are still supposed to pick the right color, though.
Dallas-based Texas Instruments wanted its new educational toy, a
headset computer, to appeal to both boys and girls.
   But the company's research showed that boys liked black headsets
and girls liked lavender, and each sex hated the other's top choice.
   The result is a grand compromise: a slate-gray headset with
cushioning foam done in purple, yellow, blue, green and magenta.

   Violinist Eugene Fodor, whose skills won
him international acclaim, was placed on probation Monday after
being indicted on cocaine and heroin charges.
   ``Of course I'm relieved that this ordeal is over,'' Fodor said.
``The experience has been a frightening and profound one. What I
want to do now is get back to my music and my life.''
   Fodor, 39, of New York City, pleaded guilty to breaking into a
Martha's Vineyard motel room where he was discovered July 27.
   A search of the room found a bottle containing more than 20
grams of cocaine, a hypodermic needle with a small amount of heroin
and a dagger.
   A Dukes County Grand Jury on Monday morning returned indictments
of breaking and entering, possession of heroin and cocaine and
possession of instruments used to administer drugs.
   After lawyers on both sides conferred, Fodor pleaded guilty to
the breaking and entering charge, which carried a maximum penalty
of six months in jail.
   Judge Raymond Cross sentenced Fodor to three years probation,
during which he must continue a drug treatment program and submit
to random drug testing.
   Fodor pleaded innocent to the other charges, and they were
placed on file, pending his completion of probation.
   ``This shouldn't have been treated as a serious criminal matter
and it wasn't,'' defense attorney Michael Altman said. ``Eugene
Fodor has been to a treatment center and has turned his life
around.''
   Born in Denver, Fodor began playing violin at age 8. He has
performed at the White House and in Moscow, where in 1974 he became
the first American medalist at the Tchaikovsky Violin Competition.
   After Fodor's arrest, family members and colleagues said his
drug use had begun recently, after he had trouble building on his
early celebrity.
   ``This was a very important experience actually in his life,''
Altman said. ``He was feeling down in the dumps and he turned
toward drugs.''
   Altman said Fodor has undergone seven weeks of treatment, and
couselors say his progress has been good and they are confident he
can remain drug free.

<HEAD>Founder of Warsaw National Philharmonic Dead</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Witold Rowicki, founder of the Warsaw
National Philharmonic Orchestra and its conductor for nearly 25
years, has died, the official PAP news agency reported Monday. He
was 75.
   The agency said Rowicki died Sunday but did not give the cause
of death or say where he died.
   Rowicki had remained active as a guest conductor since leaving
the National Philharmonic in 1977.
   He was ``one of the artists whose art has brought the greatest
fame to Polish musical culture,'' PAP said.
   Rowicki had conducted major orchestras on five continents.
   He was born Feb. 26, 1914, in Taganrog, now part of the Soviet
Union, and graduated in 1938 from the Krakow Music Conservatory,
where he became the professor of the violin class.
   During the Nazi occupation, Rowicki was a member of the symphony
orchestra in Krakow, playing violin and viola. After the war in
1945, under the new Communist regime, he became head of the music
section of Polish Radio in Katowice in southern Poland.
   There he founded the Polish Radio Orchestra, now the Grand
Symphony Orchestra of Polish Radio and Television.
   In 1950, Rowicki moved to Warsaw and founded the National
Philharmonic in the capital that was rebuilding from World War II.
Except for a three-year leave in the mid-1950s, he served as its
artistic director and first conductor until relinquishing the
position in 1977.
   When the war-ravaged Wielki Teatr, Warsaw's opulent opera,
ballet and concert hall, was finally restored in 1965, Rowicki
conducted the premier performance, featuring the opera ``The
Haunted House'' by Polish composer Moniuszko.
   After his retirement from the philharmonic, Rowicki participated
in the Wiener Meisterkurse in Vienna, a series of lectures by
masters of music.
   Rowicki, who was married and had a son and daughter, was
scheduled to appear this month as a guest conductor with the San
Francisco Symphony in the United States.
   ``Throughout his artistic career, he was faithful to his passion
of popularizing Polish music _ especially the modern,'' PAP said.

<HEAD>Justice Stevens Removes Himself from Illinois Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens will
not take part in a key Illinois case over abortion rights to be
decided during the 1989-90 term, a court spokeswoman said Monday.
   Stevens had not disqualified himself when the justices agreed
last July 3 to review the case, one of three abortion disputes
before the high court this term.
   But a minor court order issued in the Illinois case Monday noted
that Stevens did not participate.
   Asked about that, court spokeswoman Toni House said the justice
had disqualified himself from the case for unstated reasons.
   Stevens was one of four dissenters from the court's decision
last July letting states make abortions harder to get. He has
provided a consistent vote in support of the 1973 court decision
that women have a constitutional right to abortion.
   The Illinois case focuses on a state law that would require
abortion clinics to add services and equipment now found only in
hospitals.
   The law could force many clinics to close down, and could add up
to $50 to the cost of an abortion performed in the first three
months of pregnancy.
   In invalidating the law, lower courts said it violated a portion
of the 1973 ruling in Roe vs. Wade that limited state regulation
over first-trimester abortions.
   Illinois officials are not asking the justices to use the
Illinois case to reverse Roe vs. Wade, but legal experts say the
court's ruling could chip away at the trimester-by-trimester
approach taken in the 1973 decision.
   The two other abortion cases under high court study this term
focus on parental notification requirements for unwed minors
seeking to end their pregnancies in Minnesota and Ohio. Stevens has
not disqualified himself from those cases.
   The Illinois case is Turnock vs. Ragsdale, 88-790.

   PTL founder Jim Bakker testified Monday
at his fraud trial that he and his wife, Tammy, accepted $3.1
million in bonuses while the ministry's finances foundered.
   Bakker said PTL board members granted the bonuses ``of their own
free will'' and often told him, ``I was worth much more than this,
and they would say that over and over again.''
   Bakker left the witness stand Monday, completing 10 hours of
testimony that began Friday. Both sides rested their cases Monday,
with closing arguments scheduled for Tuesday. The case could go to
the jury as early as Wednesday.
   The disgraced television evangelist testified that he raised
more than $425 million for PTL from 1984 to 1987, when he and his
wife received $3.1 million in bonuses.
   Bakker was asked by his lawyer, George Davis, what he did with
the $425 million.
   ``I put it to the work of Jesus Christ,'' he said.
   During defense questioning, Bakker summed up his defense: ``We
were a church, and people always wanted to run it like a business.
I had to keep telling them, this was a church, not a business.''
   As Bakker left court during a break, he was smiling, saying, ``I
feel fine.'' He turned to Davis and said, ``This is a nice place to
visit but I didn't plan to live here.''
   In other testimony, M.C. Benton, the trustee overseeing the
ministry's property since it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection from creditors, testified PTL was $50 million in debt
and had $160 million in claims against it from ``lifetime
partners'' when Bakker resigned in March 1987.
   Bakker, 49, is charged with 15 counts of wire fraud, eight
counts of mail fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit wire and
mail fraud. Bakker is accused of diverting more than $3.7 million
in PTL money for his own benefit and of conspiring to defraud PTL
followers to support his lifestyle.
   If convicted, he faces up to 120 years in prison and more than
$5 million in fines.
   Richard Dortch, PTL's former executive vice president, was
sentenced Aug. 24 to eight years in prison and fined $200,000 under
a plea bargain. Dortch pleaded guilty to two counts of wire fraud
and one count each of mail fraud and conspiracy and testified
against Bakker.
   At the heart of the government's case is the charge that Bakker
failed to live up to his promises of providing lodging at PTL
facilities for nearly 153,000 ``partners,'' people who sent in
gifts of $1,000 or more.
   Bakker is accused of diverting money from $158 million in
contributions solicited to build lodging for donors. Bakker
testified Friday that based on his own calculations he could
accommodate more than 211,000 partners.
   ``Your long list (of available lodging) for the partners is
really a recent fabrication you prepared for this trial?'' special
prosecutor Deborah Smith asked Bakker.
   ``That's a lie,'' he responded.
   Christine Howe, a supervisor at PTL's Heritage Grand Hotel,
testified she had to turn away thousands of guests each month
because there was no room for them.
   Ms. Smith said Bakker failed to tell PTL board members about the
ministry's money problems.
   ``I don't know how the board members could not be aware of the
financial crisis at Heritage USA,'' Bakker testified. ``They knew
we had cash flow problems and they voted to borrow funds to pay for
them.''
   Ms. Smith asked Bakker if he was contradicting testimony from
six board members who said they didn't know about the ministry's
financial problems.
   ``I would tell them we were in great financial need. They were
always up to date on all the financial information,'' Bakker said.
``I gave them the information to the best of my ability.''
   But Bakker later acknowledged he may have painted a rosy picture
of PTL's finances to fellow board members.
   ``I was a minister,'' he said. ``I did my best to keep them
informed and I know I was positive in the face of turmoil at times.
I preached faith.''

<TEXT>
   Friends and foes of the conservative National
Action Party on Monday mourned the death in a traffic accident of
Manuel J. Clouthier, the party's presidential nominee in 1988
elections.
   The charismatic, 55-year-old Clouthier, who ran against
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, was killed on Sunday while
campaigning for local candidates in his home state of Sinaloa in
the northwest.
   He was considered an architect of pragmatic, business-oriented
politics within National Action.
   Salinas, in Washington on his first official visit to the United
States, called Clouthier's death ``very lamentable,'' describing
him as a Mexican ``who sought to promote the good of the country,''
the government news service Notimex said.
   Newspapers lauded Clouthier's efforts to increase democracy in
the country, which has been dominated by Salinas' Institutional
Revolutionary Party for 60 years.
   Salinas registered just over 50 percent of the vote to
Clouthier's 17 percent in an election Clouthier described as
``filthy.''
   Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, who finished second to Salinas with 31
percent of the vote, on Monday sent his ``condolences for the
tragic death of a man who loved his country and set an example for
his party members.''
   Cardenas's coalition of followers formed a new leftist party
following the presidential contest in July 1988.
   Clouthier's death came two weeks after his party celebrated its
50th anniversary and three months after National Action won its
first victory in a governor's election in Baja California.
   Ernesto Ruffo, the first opposition governor-elect in 60 years,
left the Baja state capital of Mexicali for Sinaloa state as soon
as he heard of Clouthier's death.
   Javier Calvo Manriquez, National Action's president in Sinaloa,
was killed with Clouthier when their vehicle crossed a highway lane
divider and ran into a heavy truck transporting papayas and bananas.
   A thousand people lined the streets Monday outside the Church of
the Sacred Family in Culiacan, where Clouthier's body was taken.
Funeral services were scheduled for Tuesday.
   Clouthier is survived by his wife, Leticia Carrillo de
Clouthier, and 10 children.

   A ferry traveling between Argentina
and Brazil capsized while crossing the turbulent Uruguay River on
Monday and five people drowned, officials reported. Up to 10 people
were reported missing.
   The Santa Victoria, a 26-foot launch with a crew of three, was
overloaded with 30 passengers, according to the coast guard. It
said a passing barge rescued the survivors, and five bodies were
recovered.
   The coast guard said at least four people were missing, but
border police reported nine or 10 people were not accounted for.
   Initial reports indicated the barge, transporting a bus and
several cars, collided with the ferry. But the independent news
agency Diarios y Noticias reported later that there was no
collision.
   No reason for the accident was given. However, the news agency
said the ferry was designed to carry only 12 people.
   It capsized shortly after it left Panambi, Argentina, for Vera
Cruz, Brazil.

<HEAD>U.S. Stakes Hopes on `More Constructive Soviet Role' in Indochina</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS grafs 4-5 bgng: ``Vietnamese intransigence,'' with defense
of Vietnam policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENE KRAMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior State Department official said Monday
more fighting might occur in Indochina but the United States hopes
``a more constructive Soviet role'' could help revive the stalled
Cambodian peace process and avert civil war.
   ``Unfortunately, there is a prospect of more fighting'' in the
Southeast Asian country,'' Deputy Assistant Secretary of State
David F. Lambertson told a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee.
   But ``we hope it is not prolonged'' since the failed peace
conference at Paris in August ``was not the final chapter,''
Lambertson said.
   ``Vietnamese intransigence'' at that conference is one reason
the United States believes it is premature to normalize relations
with Vietnam and will try to maintain the diplomatic and economic
isolation of Vietnam, Lambertson said.
   ``In the current situation we plan to steadfastly maintain our
support for the diplomatic and economic isolation of Vietnam as a
reminder ... that attempts to manipulate international opinion will
not provide a real basis for improved relations with other
countries,'' Lambertson said.
   He testified as critics of U.S. Cambodian policy warned of a
``fourth Indochina War'' in the current dry season and attacked
U.S.-backed Prince Norodom Sihanouk's alliance with the communist
Khmer Rouge, blamed for more than 1 million Cambodian deaths during
the regime's 1975-78 rule over the country.
   Dith Pran, the Cambodian-born photographer whose escape from the
Khmer Rouge was portrayed in the motion picture ``The Killing
Fields,'' said the breakdown at Paris means that ``Cambodians are
being forced by their leaders to go to the killing fields again.''
   Pran said international pressure is needed to force the
Cambodian factions back to the negotiating table.
   At Paris, the Soviets were ``frankly, quite passive'' about
pressing for compromise on the part of their ally, Vietnam, and
Prime Minister Hun Sen's Vietnam-backed Cambodian government,
Lambertson said.
   But he said the United States is encouraged by subsequent
``useful discussions about Cambodia'' between Secretary of State
James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
at their recent meetings in Wyoming and at the United Nations.
   The United States blames collapse of the Paris conference on the
refusal of Vietnam and Hun Sen to agree to share power with
Sihanouk in an interim Cambodian government.
   `We will continue to work on resolving the Cambodian conflict
with the Soviets in the context of the United Nations, the
continuing Paris conference process and on a bilateral basis,''
Lambertson said. ``We hope these discussions will result in a more
constructive Soviet role in this process.''
   He said the two superpowers have agreed on the need for a
political settlement ``and a continuation of the negotiating
process ... on the importance of averting both increased bloodshed
and the return of the Pol Pot (Khmer Rouge) regime to power, and
declared our readiness to announce, together with other states, a
moratorium on military assistance to all Cambodian factions as part
of a comprehensive settlement.''
   Lambertson said Vietnam appeared to have met its pledge to
withdraw its military forces from Cambodia late last month, ending
an 11-year occupation. While there was no evidence to back reports
of ``massive'' numbers remaining, the withdrawal should be verified
as part of an overall political settlement, he said.
   ``U.S. government assistance to the non-communist resistance has
been and continues to be non-lethal,'' Lambertson said, an apparent
reference to recent reports from the area about weapons assistance.
In the days ahead, he said, ``it is critical to maintain support
for Prince Sihanouk'' and the other non-communist Cambodians, he
said.
   But Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., chairman of the East Asian and
Pacific Affairs subcommittee, said the United States had pursued a
``morally bankrupt'' policy of backing Sihanouk's insistence on
including the Khmer Rouge in an interim Cambodian government, ``not
because we supported the Khmer Rouge, but because we supported
Prince Sihanouk.''

   President Alfredo Cristiani of El Salvador
on Monday proposed a cease-fire with leftist rebels who have fought
for 10 years to overthrow his country's government.
   He told the 44th General Assembly he will formally propose the
cease-fire at a meeting with the rebel Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front in San Jose, Costa Rica, on Oct. 16-17, ``because
the suffering must be brought to an end once and for all.''
   Cristiani invited all political factions in El Salvador to join
the current government. He said his administration would discuss
guarantees of security for the FMLN.
   After his speech, he told a news conference the rebels' interest
in political negotiations is partly due to Moscow's reluctance to
continued funding of guerrilla movements worldwide.
   About 70,000 people have died in the civil war.
   Cristiani's rightist ARENA party took office June 1 after
defeating the incumbent, centrist Christian Democrats in elections.
   The U.S.-backed government and the rebels held a first round of
preliminary peace talks in Mexico City in September. They decided
then to hold more meetings to seek a negotiated settlement of the
war.
   The rebels announced on Sept. 22 that they would not extend an
11-day truce that expired that day because the guerrillas felt the
government was not responding positively and was increasing
repression.
   The rebels last week launched a nationwide offensive that killed
or wounded 78 people.

   About 1,200 teachers and other
school workers went on strike Monday, canceling classes for 15,000
students in the state's fourth-largest district.
   The employees, represented by the East St. Louis Federation of
Teachers, walked out after rejecting the school board's proposal
for binding arbitration to settle disputes over wage increases and
insurance payments. A federal mediator had been trying to help the
sides reach an agreement.
   Negotiations resumed Monday afternoon. Thirty-three schools were
closed.
   The school board has offered employees a 2 percent pay raise for
the next year, but teachers would have to pay from $22 to $34 per
month for health insurance coverage for dependents. The district
currently pays for dependents' health insurance.
   The teachers' union is asking for a 5 percent pay raise with the
school district continuing to pay all health insurance bills .
   ``The district made every reasonable effort to avoid this
interruption of the educational process,'' school officials said in
a statement. There are ``certain undeniable economic facts which
some in the teaching ranks are apparently unwilling to accept.''
   The school district is trying to lower its $12.5 million debt.
   Union president Terry Turley said his members, who have been
working without a contract since the school year began, are
sensitive to the district's financial distress.
   ``As a matter of fact, last year we agreed to work with a wage
freeze with the promise that this year our concerns would be
addressed in some way,'' Turley said. ``As we began the strike
today, many of those concerns have not been addressed.''

<TEXT>
   Imelda Marcos pledged in a radio
interview broadcast Tuesday to return to the United States to stand
trial on racketeering charges if allowed to leave and bury her
husband in the Philippines.
   Supporters of former President Ferdinand Marcos asked the
Philippine Supreme Court on Monday to lift the ban on returning his
body to his homeland for burial and let Marcos' widow and three
children return.
   The high court was to consider the appeal at its regular weekly
session Tuesday.
   Marcos died Thursday at age 72 in Hawaii. He had lived there in
exile after a popular uprising in February 1986 ended his 20-year
presidency.
   President Corazon Aquino banned return of his remains and barred
members of his family, saying a Marcos burial in his homeland could
ignite unrest. Marcos supporters have been linked to repeated coup
attempts, though protests since he died have been small and
peaceful.
   U.S. authorities have banned Mrs. Marcos from leaving the United
States. She is to stand trial in New York in March on U.S. charges
of embezzling Philippine government funds and using some of the
money for U.S. investments.
   ``I will have to go back to New York because I have to face the
indictment,'' she told Manila radio station DZXL in an interview
from Honolulu. ``What I am defending here is not only the Marcos
name but the entire nation.''
   Mrs. Marcos, who is free on $5 million bail, claimed the
indictment against her tarnished the Filipino nation. Philippine
officials believe the Marcos family and their associates made off
with up to $10 billion in embezzled money, kickbacks, and other
funds during his administration.
   ``They have spat on Filipinos here,'' Mrs. Marcos said. ``Is it
because our color is brown? No, I am going back to New York.''
   She claimed Marcos remained the legitimate president of the
Philippines until his death.
   ``He is the real president. She is illegal,'' Mrs. Marcos said,
referring to Mrs. Aquino. ``This irregularity should be brought to
all the courts of the world.''
   The appeal filed Monday said the ban against Marcos violates the
Philippine Constitution and Mrs. Aquino's commitment to due process.
   ``What we are asking for is for the family to be allowed to come
back and bury the president,'' said Nicanor Yniguez, leader of
Marcos' New Society Movement party.
   Francisco Chavez, the Philippines' chief law officer, said the
government will argue that the issue is political, not legal.
   On Sept. 15, the court ruled in an 8-7 decision that Marcos'
return would pose a security threat.
   The appeal said Marcos' death ``should completely remove
apprehension, however unfounded, as to both his intent and
capability to `destabilize' conditions in the country.''
   It argued that Mrs. Aquino's ``inability or failure to assure
stability'' has been used ``to impair individual rights.''
   Rolando Abadilla, Marcos' former Manila area intelligence chief,
said the Marcos group will organize a march on Manila from Marcos'
birthplace in Sarrat, 250 miles to the north, if the petition is
rejected.
   Abadilla, vice governor of Marcos' home province of Ilocos
Norte, has been linked to previous coup attempts against Mrs.
Aquino.
   Former Sen. Arturo Tolentino, Marcos' running mate in 1986,
suggested the body be flown to Laoag, capital of Ilocos Norte,
instead of Manila, and buried there. Laoag is about 250 miles north
of the capital.

<HEAD>Soviet Foreign Minister Calls For `New Deal' Worldwide</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BETH J. HARPAZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet foreign minister called Monday for an
international ``New Deal'' to avert an impending economic disaster
fueled by militarization, Third World debt, poverty and
environmental problems.
   ``Right before our eyes the world is sliding into a deep
economic depression,'' Eduard Shevardnadze said in a speech in
Manhattan sponsored by the Foreign Policy Association.
   ``The debt of the Third World countries, the interest they have
to pay and the pace of their economic development _ are these not
the signs of an impending catastrophe?''
   He added: ``We could one day begin competing not for political
supremacy or spheres of influence but for access to water, fresh
air and even a green lawn.''
   Shevardnadze told the audience of about 350 people that the
abolition of nuclear weapons, forgiveness of some Third World debts
and increased protection for the environment will be essential for
peace and worldwide stability in the next century.
   ``Radical bold steps are needed, a kind of `New Deal,' a
transition to a policy that would draw developing countries into
the scientific, technological and information revolution,'' he said.
   In the 1930s during the Great Depression, President Franklin D.
Roosevelt promised Americans a ``New Deal'' of government-sponsored
social welfare programs.
   Shevardnadze compared pessimism over the future of perestroika,
the economic liberalization of the Soviet Union, to pessimism over
the future of capitalism during the 1930s in the United States.
   He noted that in 1931, 100,000 Americans requested permission to
emigrate to the Soviet Union.
   ``There were bread lines in New York's Times Square and tents of
the jobless huddled along Riverside Drive,'' he said, adding: ``It
is well known that in those years there were widespread
expectations in left-wing circles that the severe crisis of the
world capitalist system would finally bring about the world
revolution.''
   He said the Soviet Union's ``economic system is undergoing an
adjustment. ... Something similar happened in the Unites States 60
years ago.''
   But he predicted that ``so long as there is the will, the
understanding of the situation and the determination to change
things for the better _ and we certainly have them _ the economy
can remedy its ills.''

   The House on Monday overwhelmingly approved
President Bush's compromise plan to extend steel import
restrictions on 29 foreign trading partners until April 1992.
   The vote was 354-10.
   Bush's plan, announced July 25, called for immediate
negotiations with Japan, South Korea and other leading
steel-exporting nations to extend annual limitations on the volume
of steel allowed to be shipped to the United States.
   The original pacts, which expired Saturday, were negotiated by
the Reagan administration in 1984 to give domestic steelmakers
breathing space from subsidized, foreign competition.
   Many steel-district lawmakers had pushed the administration this
summer to extend the curbs for five years. But Bush opted for a
smaller-scale, 2{-year program in deference to steel-using
manufacturers who argued that the quotas have driven up steel
prices and caused supply shortages of some steel products.
   The compromise all but eliminated debate on the House floor.
Opposition came largely from free-traders who felt the steel
industry has had enough protection.
   ``It's not my first choice,'' said Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn.,
who had opposed the industry's requests for a longer extension.
``Nevertheless, I have to admit it's about as good a compromise as
could be achieved.''
   Rep. Joseph Gaydos, D-Pa., who represents a western Pennsylvania
steel district, said the Reagan and Bush program ``is not a
cure-all, but has been the most effective method of dealing with
dumped imports.
   ``This legislation is basically and fundamentally giving the
steel industry in this country a little more time to become
competitive. And they're well underway,'' Gaydos said.
   Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., has introduced a companion measure in
the Senate, but no action on it has yet been taken.
   With the old steel program due to expire Sept. 30, the Bush
administration could not afford to wait until Congress acted to
begin the painstaking process of negotiating new import ceilings.
   Trade representatives from Japan, South Korea, the European
Community, Mexico, Venezuela and Romania were all in town last week
for meetings on renewing their pacts.
   Many of the negotiations are already complete, according to U.S.
Trade Representative Carla Hills. Even though Congress has not yet
finished work on the bill, she said steel imports would continued
to be monitored by the Department of Commerce and the U.S. Customs
Service.
   No details on individual pacts have yet been announced.

   A federal drug agent, his wife and the
owner of a construction company pleaded innocent Monday in an
indictment that alleges thousands of dollars were funneled into
real estate and coin collections.
   Drug Enforcement Administration agent Dennis Harker, his wife,
Mary Ann Harker, and Susan K. Terry, who owns SKT Construction, all
entered the pleas before U.S. Magistrate Celeste Bremer. Bremer set
a Dec. 4 trial.
   The charges against the three include tax violations, conspiracy
and structuring bank deposits to avoid a $10,000 limit over which
banks are required to report cash deposits.
   An indictment handed up by a grand jury last month details real
estate and bank transactions and charges the Harkers had hundreds
of thousands of dollars in transactions during years they reported
only a fraction of that income.
   In all, there are 11 counts in the indictment, with Harker
charged in eight of the counts, Ms. Terry in six and Mrs. Harker in
four.
   The indictment alleges that between 1986 and 1988 Harker and his
wife ``spent, invested and profited by cash transactions exceeding
$1 million.''
   The indictment did not elaborate further on the charges and did
not mention drugs.
   Harker is a DEA agent in Miami, but he earlier lived in West Des
Moines. Ms. Terry and the Harkers describe themselves as friends
since high school. Mrs. Terry also has been identified as a
business partner of Roxanne Conlin, a former U.S. Attorney and
Democratic candidate for governor.
   The indictment says Ms. Terry and Harker set up a company which
funneled cash to real estate investments and rare coin transactions.
   All three were free pending the trial. As part of the bail
requirements, all three must turn in their passports. Harker will
be forced to get rid of his extensive gun collection despite his
lawyer's arguments being a DEA agent means Harker lives under
serious threats.
   Harker could face up to 40 years in prison and $2 million in
fines if convicted on all the charges. The Harkers also could owe
taxes and penalties.
   Mrs. Harker, 40, faces up to 20 years in prison and $1 million
in fines if convicted. Ms. Terry, 38, faces up to 30 years in jail
and fines of up to $1.5 million.

<HEAD>Karpov Draws with Yusupov in Battle To Challenge World Chess Champion</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS throughout, UPDATING with chess results, Kasparov earns
record rating. No pickup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOODMAN</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former world champion Anatoly Karpov drew with
fellow Soviet Artur Yusupov in their first game Monday in a battle
among four top chess grandmasters to decide the challenger to
reigning champion Garri Kasparov.
   Jan Timman of the Netherlands and British grandmaster Jon
Speelman adjourned on the 60th move in the other game in the World
Championship Candidates' semifinal at Sadler's Wells ballet theater
in London.
   Timman was a pawn ahead in an endgame but most experts predicted
a draw when play resumes.
   Kasparov, in the 13th annual Interpolis chess tournament in
Tilburg, Holland, on Monday earned the highest rating record in the
history of the game, shattering U.S. player Bobby Fischer's 1972
record.
   The Soviet champion, by defeating Norway's Simen Agdestein in
the final round, won 12 points out of 14 matches, the best
tournament record ever. A win scores one point, and a draw half a
point.
   This entitled 26-year-old Kasparov to a total of 2,795 points on
the international ranking list of the World Chess Federation, known
by the French initials FIDE.
   Fischer's 1972 record was 2,785 points.
   Although the next rating list will not be officially published
before Jan. 1, Kasparov, who plans no further tournament
appearances this year, seems certain of his record.
   The second round in the semifinals in London will be played
Tuesday.
   The two winners of the semifinals contest will meet in the
Candidates' final scheduled for March in London.
   The winner will challenge Kasparov for his world title in a
24-game contest in October 1990.
   Playing with the disadvantage of the black pieces, Karpov
quickly neutralized Yusupov's opening advantage and exchanged both
pairs of rooks to reach an endgame where neither side could make
meaningful progress.
   After further exchanges, Yusupov forced a draw on the 44th move.
   Timman, playing white, gained an early opening initiative.
Speelman mistakes on the 17th and 21st moves let Timman reach an
endgame with an extra pawn and superior placed pieces.
   ``It's just one of those days when you miss everything,'' said
British grandmaster Nigel Short, the third ranked player in the
world, of Speelman's early play.
   But having gained a winning position, Timman failed to find
several promising continuations and Speelman put up the toughest of
defenses.
   In the adjourned position, each side has a rook. Timman has
three pawns and Speelman two.
   ``It looks like a draw now,'' said Short after Timman sealed his
61st move. ``Timman missed a lot of chances.''
   Karpov, 38, is heavily favored to knock out the 29-year-old
Yusupov. The outcome of the Timman-Speelman contest remains, in the
words of British Grandmaster Daniel King, ``completely unclear.''
   Karpov, ranked second in the world, held the world title for 10
years before losing to Kasparov in November 1985. Karpov is famous
for his so-called creeping style which analysts say squeezes the
play out of his opponent's position like a boa constrictor squeezes
the life from its prey. He has never lost to Yusupov.
   Yusupov, the world's 14th ranked player, rose to prominence in
1977 when he won the world under-20 championship at age 17.
   He will be hoping for a repeat of Karpov's astonishing collapse
at a June tournament in Rotterdam in the Netherlands. Over a
dramatic final three rounds, Karpov lost every game for the first
time in his long career.
   The winner of that tournament was Timman, a 37-year-old who is
ranked eighth in the world. By virtue of his formidable
performances, Timman was for many years the top Western grandmaster
and in 1987 a magnificent run of victories put him within striking
distance of Karpov.
   Speelman, who celebrated his 33rd birthday Monday, is ranked
13th in the world. He has a solid and tricky playing style,
punctuated with flashes of brilliance.
   Speelman, in the six-game quarter final, defeated Short by
3.5-1.5.
   Speelman said of the semifinals in his column in London's
newspaper The Sunday Correspondent: ``Before Karpov's collapse at
the end of Rotterdam I would have rated him the overwhelming
favorite against Artur Yusupov. Now I put him at about 70-30. I
rate Jan Timman favorite by about 55-45, but will strive mightily
to upset these odds.''
   The winner of each contest will receive $77,000, the loser
$46,000.
   If the matches are tied 4-4 after eight games, two more games
will be played. If it is still tied, the rules call for sudden
death games.

   Rain, floods and a tornado heaped more
misery on Hugo-wrecked South Carolina on Monday, interrupting
rebuilding efforts from the storm that pummeled the coast 12 days
ago.
   Relief officials deluged with clothing urged donors to send
building supplies, food and cash.
   ``I feel sorry for the people. It's terrible. It adds insult to
injury,'' National Weather Service meterologist Dick Shenot said
after 2.5 inches of rain fell in a 24-hour period on Charleston,
the town hardest hit by Hugo's 135-mph winds.
   A tornado in Lebanon, about 25 miles north of here, left two
injured. About 100 people in Anderson County, 200 miles north, had
to be evacuated due to flooding.
   The Broad and Blair rivers in Gaffney, the Congaree River in St.
Matthews, the Waccamaw River in Conway and the Saluda River in
Chappells all spilled over their banks Monday.
   The Tiger River rose 12 feet above flood stage, damaging a major
telephone cable and knocking out long-distance service from
Spartanburg to Asheville, N.C., said Ron Laughlin, spokesman for
AT&amp;T. He had no estimate of the number of people affected, but said
service was expected to be restored by nightfall.
   In neighboring North Carolina, also deluged by rain Monday and
also still recovering from the wrath of Hugo, Monroe rescuers were
looking for three people missing when a creek flooded and swept
away their car. A fourth passenger was rescued after clinging to a
downed tree for more than an hour.
   Aid from across the nation continued to pour into South Carolina
for victims of the hurricane. The response has been so
overwhelming, though, that some officials don't know what to do
with everything.
   ``We have clothing backed up on us, including in boxcars that
have come from the West Coast,'' Maj. Ken Bush of the Salvation
Army said. ``People, generally speaking, only want a number of
clothes ... and we've reached that certain amount. We're
backlogged.''
   In the fishing village of McClellanville, population 500, about
10 classrooms in the local school are filled ``from floor to
ceiling with used clothing.''
   ``Used clothing has almost choked us to death,'' Billy Newsom of
the American Red Cross said.
   Bush and Newsom said donations of non-perishable food items are
still desperately needed. As cleanup efforts progress, hardware
items will be in demand to help repair homes and businesses, Bush
said.
   Sixty trucks carrying canned food, clothing and other relief
material reached Charleston on Monday, said Charleston Mayor Joseph
Riley, praising the cities across the country which have sent aid.
   ``There has never been in our country's history this degree of
community sharing,'' Riley said. ``You can bet your bottom dollar
that the next city that has a disaster, Charleston will be
represented'' in giving aid.
   A cash and food drive held at 10 college football games in six
Southeastern states over the weekend generated about $60,000 and
six tractor-trailer loads of canned goods, said organizer U.S. Sen.
Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.
   His colleague, Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., took to the Senate
floor Monday and continued his criticism of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, the agency coordinating the federal government's
response to the disaster.
   ``FEMA does not have but 10 centers in South Carolina 10 days
after the disaster,'' he said. ``And, as far as I know, they still
haven't given out a financial grant yet.''
   Marilyn Quayle, the vice president's wife, visited the
hardest-hit areas of South Carolina and worked briefly at a FEMA
center in Moncks Corner on Monday. ``I don't think news accounts
can adequately describe the damage that is in this state. It's
really incredible,'' Mrs. Quayle said. ``It was very beneficial for
me to see and really understand what the state is going through. We
will be taking back information to the vice president and
president.''
   ``It was wonderful. I wasn't expecting it,'' said Annabell
Frazier, who was interviewed by Mrs. Quayle for federal aid. The
roof of Ms. Frazier's home blew off and water poured into the house
during the hurricane.
   Hurricane Hugo slammed into South Carolina Sept. 21 with 135 mph
winds, leaving at least 18 dead, 50,000 homeless, 270,000 jobless,
and homes, businesses, schools and municipal buildings damaged or
destroyed as far inland as Sumter and north to North Carolina. In
all, 29 people were killed on the U.S. mainland.
   Damage has been estimated at $3 billion or more, with crop
damage placed at some $100 million.
   Insurance agents have fanned out across the state since the day
after the hurricane hit. State Farm Insurance Co., the largest home
and automobile insurer in the state, expects to handle 130,000
claims worth $500 million, said company President Edward Rust Jr.
   ``It would be the largest single disaster we've ever
encountered,'' he said.
   There were signs the city was returning to normal. Classes
resumed Monday at the College of Charleston, the Medical University
of South Carolina and Baptist College. Cadets at The Citadel were
asked to return Wednesday.
   An 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew was scaled back to 9 p.m. until 5
a.m., enforced by National Guardsmen toting M-16 rifles.
   The Ben Sawyer Bridge, which links the barrier islands of Isle
of Palms and Sullivans Island to neighboring Mount Pleasant, was
expected to be back in place by Wednesday. The span of the swing
bridge was knocked into the Intracoastal Waterway during the
hurricane, cutting off all access to the islands by vehicle.
   In Myrtle Beach, beachfront property owners were told they could
begin applying for permits to repair seawalls, homes and businesses
that were less than two-thirds damaged by the hurricane.
   The Beachfront Management Act, enacted in 1988 to limit
development along the state's 187-mile coast, prohibits rebuilding
or repairs on structures that are more than two-thirds damaged.
   About 5,900 structures in North Myrtle Beach, Myrtle Beach,
Georgetown County and Charleston were damaged or destroyed, said
Donna Gress, spokeswoman for the South Carolina Coastal Council,
which enforces the law.
   Also Monday, The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced that two
state firms will buttress eight miles of beach from North Myrtle
Beach to Pawleys Island later this week at a cost of about $820,000.
   The sand is meant to block further erosion during expected high
tides in mid-October at oceanfront properties already damaged by
Hurricane Hugo.
   The federal government will pay 75 percent of the cost under an
arrangement with FEMA. More beaches may be declared eligible for
such federal money or for state funds, said Tucker Eskew, spokesman
for Gov. Carroll Campbell.

   Rival Colombian drug cartels may be joining
forces to keep smuggling and distribution lines open during their
government's crackdown, a federal agent investigating a record
cocaine seizure said Monday.
   Drug agents were surprised to find cocaine from both the
Medellin and Cali cartels in a Los Angeles warehouse that housed 20
tons of cocaine, said John M. Zienter, the Drug Enforcement
Administration's special agent for Los Angeles.
   ``It very well could be that, based on the pressure in Colombia,
this is a way cartels are trying to get much of the cocaine out of
the country and to maintain distribution channels,'' said Zienter,
who declined to say exactly how much of the cocaine was from the
two cartels named for the cities where they are based.
   DEA spokesman Cornelius Dougherty in Washington said he did not
believe it was unusual for the cartels to work together.
   ``They're not as competitive as might be the public perception
when it comes to what is the best, most profitable way to
distribute (the cocaine),'' he said. ``What works for one will work
for the other.''
   Seven men were arrested Thursday and Friday in Los Angeles and
Las Vegas in connection with the 20-ton seizure Thursday.
   Arrested Thursday in Los Angeles were James Romero McTague, 41,
of El Paso and Mauricio Monroy, 36, of Mexico City. On Friday,
authorities arrested Hugo Fernando Castillon, 32, of Sherman Oaks
and Miguel Garcia Chavez, 34, of Panorama City, who sometimes uses
the alias Ronald Reagan.
   The four men arrested in Los Angeles appeared before a Municipal
Court judge, who agreed to postpone their arraignments on various
drug charges until Oct. 6. The men were ordered to remain in jail
without bail.
   Authorities said they plan to eventually consolidate the cases
in a federal action.
   ``These are the major drug dealers, not just the runners,'' said
Los Angeles County District Attorney Ira Reiner. ``They are as
large as they get outside Colombia.''
   One of the men arrested in Las Vegas, Carlos Tapia Ponce, was
described by authorities as a former customs inspector for the
Mexican government who became a major drug smuggling player.
   Tapia Ponce, 68, was arrested at the Flamingo Hilton hotel in
Las Vegas, along with his son, Hector Tapia Anchondo, 38, and
Hector Eduardo Tapia Ponce, 66, the brother of Carlos, the Drug
Enforcement Agency said. Federal officials said Monday they did not
have enough evidence to charge the brother in the case.
   The father and son case appeared before U.S. Magistrate Lawrence
Leavitt in Las Vegas on Monday, but refused to identify themselves
on the advice of their defense attorney, David Chesnoff.
   Leavitt set an identity hearing for Friday to be followed by a
detention hearing, where motions for bail will be argued. They are
being held without bail.
   Leavitt set an identity hearing for Friday to be followed by a
detention hearing, where motions for bail will be argued. They are
being held without bail. Chesnoff also requested a preliminary
hearing for the two, which under law must be held within 10 days.
   Tapia Ponce apparently ran the Mexican operation, said Special
Assistant U.S. Attorney Susan Bryant-Deason.
   ``He picks up the ball once it is in his country, and moves back
into the hands of the Colombians in L.A.,'' said Ms. Bryant-Deason.
``The rest of the men work for him. Anybody who gets that close to
that much narcotics is an extremely trusted part of the
organization.''
   In the Los Angeles raid, authorities acting on a tip knocked
apart a $6 padlock on Adriana's Pottery Warehouse in suburban
Sylmar, 25 miles northwest of Los Angeles, and found 40,000 pounds
of cocaine, worth between $2 billion and $20 billion on the street.
Also found was $10 million in cash.
   It was the world's largest drug seizure, topping the previous
record of 12 tons seized in Colombia.
   The seizure also signaled the existence of a major drug route in
which the drugs are shipped from Colombia to Mexico, taken across
the border through El Paso, Texas, and shipped, probably by truck,
to Los Angeles for American distribution.
   On Friday, officials raided six warehouses in El Paso as well as
three homes in Juarez, Mexico. Authorities said the warehouses were
used as staging sites before the cocaine was transported to Los
Angeles.
   Ray Sepulveda, DEA special agent in El Paso, said his agents
discovered an underground storage facility being excavated in one
of six warehouses he and his men raided in east El Paso.
   DEA agents who tore down a false wall found a concealed room
about the size of a living room, he said.
   ``They had been digging a pit down about 20 feet. It would have
been a good hiding place for narcotics,'' Sepulveda told the El
Paso Herald-Post.
   Drug agents in California, meanwhile, had begun destroying the
20 tons of cocaine, said Zienter. The $10 million had been
deposited into a downtown Los Angeles bank.

   The Atlantic hurricane season's thirteenth tropical
depression formed Monday evening, packing top winds of 35 mph and
showing signs of growing strength, the National Weather Service
said.
   Satellite pictures taken at 10:30 p.m. EDT Monday showed the
strong depression near latitude 14.8 north and longitude 48.6 west,
about 830 miles east of the Windward Islands.
   Forecasters said the depression would continue moving west
northwest at 12 mph and could carry tropical storm-force winds of
39 mph by Tuesday.
   Once a storm's maximum sustained winds reach 74 mph, it becomes
a hurricane. Hurricane Hugo was the eighth named storm and Iris was
the ninth of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1
to Nov. 30.

   A Colombian named as the co-conspirator with
Panamanian Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega in a 1988 cocaine
trafficking indictment was ordered held without bond Monday by a
federal judge.
   Ramon Saldarriaga, 45, who was arrested Saturday south of Miami,
is only the second defendant of 16 named in the indictment to
appear in court.
   Saldarriaga is charged with conspiracy and two other counts in
the 12-count, 30-page indictment returned by a federal grand jury
in Miami on Feb. 4, 1988.
   The indictment accuses Saldarriaga of conspiracy to import
cocaine and aiding and abetting in cocaine trafficking linked to
the Medellin drug cartel. If convicted on all counts, he faces a
maximum prison sentence of 40 years.
   Saldarriaga's attorney, Steven Kreisberg, said his client has
lived in Florida since the early 1980s.
   Saldarriaga did not enter a plea, and Turnoff scheduled
arraignment for Oct. 13.
   Authorities at the hearing before U.S. District Court Judge
William Turnoff said Saldarriaga was caught in a routine traffic
case, but Saldarriaga's wife told The Associated Press that ``there
were at least seven police cars and there was a helicopter
overhead.''
   Bryan Davidow, the only U.S. citizen named in the Noriega
indictment, surrendered a few days after the indictment was issued
and has been released on bail. No date has been set for Davidow's
trial before U.S. District Court Judge William Hoveler.

<HEAD>Exxon President Says `Chance' Was Oil Spill Factor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROSEANNE PAGANO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of Exxon said Monday the
11 million-gallon Valdez oil spill has given him renewed respect
for ``what chance can do when it zeroes in on a target.''
   ``Valdez has made us appeciate all over again that plan as we
will, take care as best we can, we are all subject to chance,''
William D. Stevens told the state Chamber of Commerce. ``Especially
are we subject to human error.''
   Stevens, in only his third public appearance since the nation's
worst oil spill on March 24, said the oil giant was not trying to
avoid responsibility for the wreck of the Exxon Valdez.
   Instead, he said, ``a recognition that chance often has a say in
human affairs does allow a more dispassionate view of what
happened.''
   A breath analysis of former tanker Capt. Joseph Hazelwood taken
nine hours after the accident revealed his blood-alcohol level was
.06. The Coast Guard limit is .04. Investigators also are
questioning why a third mate was at the helm as the tanker was
navigated through glacial ice floes while Hazelwood apparently was
in his quarters.
   Stevens, whose speech was interrupted three times by hecklers,
said the oil spill had hurt his professional pride, but he said he
was satisfied with Exxon's billion-dollar cleanup was having
results.
   He said summerlong efforts to treat tarred Alaska beaches had
produced ``very remarkable progress.''
   ``Should we let chance events which could happen prevent us from
taking risk?'' he asked.
   Without accepting risk, he said, there could have been no
oilfields at Prudhoe Bay and no trans-Alaska Pipeline. Without
them, he said, Alaskans would have been denied a share in oil
development wealth.
   Stevens said managing risk was a related Valdez lesson. If great
undertakings are forfeited or delayed because of the risk of
accident, Stevens said, ``the country and all of us will be the
poorer.''
   ``We all have some stake in Alaska oil,'' he said, noting that
the state's oil meets 25 percent of U.S. demand. Stevens said
``soaring imports, unrest in the Mideast and few viable oil and gas
alternatives'' all remind him of conditions from the mid-1970s that
led to U.S. gasoline shortages.
   Development will continue to focus on Alaska, Stevens said,
since analysts have predicted as much as a third of the nation's
undiscovered oil is here.
   Stevens also said he was satisfied that Exxon policies regarding
tanker captain training and alcohol use on the job are adequate. He
said the oil spill was like ``a bad dream.'' He said it had
prompted a review of company policy, which Stevens said was
determined to be sound.
   ``I don't mean that to sound as if we are self-satisfied,''
Stevens told a crowd of about 600. ``Clearly, procedures weren't
followed,'' he said.

   Angola's foreign minister indicated Monday
that if the United States continues aiding Jonas Savimbi's UNITA
rebels, the withdrawal of Cuban troops from his country might be
halted.
   Pedro de Castro van Dunem claimed U.S. officials repeatedly told
Angola that Washington would extend diplomatic recognition to
Angola and end aid to the rebels if Angola agreed to the Cuban
troop withdrawal.
   The United States and South Africa have linked the removal of an
estimated 50,000 Cuban soldiers in Angola by mid-1991 to South
Africa's agreement to cooperate with a U.N. plan to grant
independence to Namibia by April 1990.
   Chester Crocker, former U.S. assistant secretary of state for
African affairs, said in a telephone interview Monday the United
States did not promise to end aid to UNITA or to give diplomatic
recognition to Angola.
   He mediated the accords last year between South Africa, Angola
and Cuba on Namibia and the Cuban withdrawal.
   ``In 1988, we did not make any commitment, in principle or
otherwise, as the United States, to end aid to UNITA,'' Crocker
said. ``South Africa did,'' he said.
   Crocker said in December that Washington would not end its
support for UNITA while Angola received military aid from the
Soviet Union.
   In an interview at U.N. headquarters, van Dunem was asked if the
U.S. aid to UNITA might mean the Cuban troops would remain in
Angola. He said, ``We have not discussed this question, but it can
be a question.''
   In August, when six Cuban soldiers were killed in a rebel
ambush, Cuban President Fidel Castro said further attacks ``can
unfavorably influence compliance with the timetable for the Cuban
troops' withdrawal from the People's Republic of Angola.''
   Both Savimbi and Angolan officials are taking their case to
Washington.
   Van Dunem said he has requested a meeting with Secretary of
State James A. Baker III.
   Savimbi is in Washington seeking continued aid to the rebels'
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola _ UNITA.
   UNITA has been battling Angola's Marxist government since 1975
when the country gained its independence from Portugal and the
Soviet-backed Popular Liberation Movement of Angola won a brief
civil war.
   Cuba sent troops to Angola to help the government battle the
rebels.
   A change in the scheduled withdrawal of the Cubans could
jeopardize the planned independence for South African-ruled
Namibia, also known as South-West Africa.
   UNITA and Angola signed a peace accord June 22 and declared a
cease-fire effective two days later, but it broke down within weeks
amid charges of violations.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said recently
that U.N. military observers confirmed 15,927 Cuban personnel left
Angola by Aug. 1 and the rate of departure was ``fully consistent''
with a timetable calling for complete withdrawal by mid-1991.

converging on Prague and Warsaw now that East Berlin has allowed

   In mid-September, East Germany's Communist leaders registered
fierce protests when Hungary's liberal leaders opened their border
to the West and thousands of East Germans fled.
   But this weekend East Berlin actually agreed to allow another
wave in the exodus after the grounds of West Germany's embassy in
Prague, Czechoslovakia, had become a crowded, muddy encampment for
hundreds of East German refugees.
   On Friday, Mikhail S. Gorbachev is expected in East Berlin to

saddled with a Third World economy and that situation won't change
any time soon, even with Mikhail Gorbachev's reform efforts, many
Soviet experts believe.
   If anything, these analysts said, the Soviet economy is in worse
shape now than when Gorbachev launched his perestroika, or
restructuring program.
   He is facing the need to slash a huge budget deficit in half
while at the same time coping with an economy which went into a
nosedive in the spring even as inflation was heating up.
   ``The Soviet economy has fallen behind,'' said Howard Wachtel,
an economics professor at American University in Washington. ``When
you take off the tight controls of a command system, you lose the
threat over people and you get a drop in productivity unless you
replace it with something else, like market incentives.''

   Americans overwhelmingly favor an increase in
``sin taxes'' to help fund President Bush's war on drugs, according
to a Media General-Associated Press poll.
   The poll also found that many preferred treatment of drug users
to punishment, and expressed doubt that more prisons will help.
   And many doubted Bush's plan will succeed: Among the 61 percent
who called drug abuse the nation's most important problem, barely
more than a third expected the problem to ease during the next
decade.
   Nearly one-third of all respondents knew someone who uses
cocaine. But most said drug abuse is not a serious problem in their
own neighborhoods, and just one-seventh rated it ``very serious''
where they live.
   The poll, conducted Sept. 14-24 among 1,071 Americans, had a
margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
   Bush has proposed a $7.9 billion program to fight illegal drugs,
saying they are ``sapping our strength as a nation.'' Seventy
percent of the money is earmarked for law enforcement, the rest for
education and treatment.

   It took Hurricane Hugo six hours to roar
across South Carolina, lashing the state with wind, rain and flood.
Officials ending a week of cleanup say those few hours will be felt
for years.
   The storm smashed the state's economy, throwing thousands out of
work. It devastated timberlands, farmlands and coastal areas,
damaging everything from tourist havens to shrimp beds. The genteel
face of Charleston has been scarred and muddied.
   ``It's not going to be a quick process, it is going to be hard
for all of us,'' said Joseph P. Riley Jr., the mayor of Charleston,
where more than 2,500 historically significant buildings were
damaged. The repairs to those building will take five years.
   The immediate effects are obvious. Eleven days after South
Carolina bore the brunt of the storm, thousands of people remain
without electricity, and an estimated 50,000 are homeless.

<TEXT>
   Fernando Collor de Mello, the
independent candidate in Brazil's first presidential election by
popular vote in 29 years, has lost ground in opinion polls but
still remains far in front of 22 other candidates.
   In the most recent survey for the Nov. 15 balloting by the
newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo, Collor de Mello was the choice of 33
percent of the voters, down from more than 40 percent four months
ago.
   The populist Leonel Brizola, his most vehement adversary, had 15
percent, and Luis Inacio Lula da Silva of the left-wing Worker's
Party, a front-runner early on, had 7 percent.
   The private polling organization IBOPE on Sept. 28 gave Collor
de Mello 35 percent, Brizola 14 percent and da Silva 8 percent.
   All other candidates came below the top three in both polls.
   Collor de Mello, ideologically right-of-center and running under
the banner of the newly formed National Reconstruction Party,
promotes himself as an independent without ties to vested
interests. He promises to launch an all-out war on what he says is
a corrupt government bureaucracy.
   ``There's a tremendous sense of moral outrage out there, a
disgust with the status quo,'' said Eli Diniz, a political science
professor at the University Research Institute of Rio de Janeiro.
``Collor de Mello, running as the anti-candidate and
anti-politician, has capitalized on it.''
   But political opponents charge that Collor de Mello is guilty of
the same kind of corruption he vows to eliminate.
   ``The man is a hoax,'' said Rep. Vivaldo Barbosa of Brizola's
Democratic Labor Party.
   In August, Barbosa delivered a 228-page report to the Justice
Ministry containing allegations of corruption during Collor's
tenure as governor of the poor northeastern state of Alagoas from
January, 1987, to this past May. The accusations are now being
investigated.
   The report charges that:
   _He gave a $400,000 state contract to a company owned by a close
political associate, Zelia Cardoso de Mello (no relative), without
competitive bidding.
   _He named thousands to state jobs just before he resigned as
governor to run for president.
   _He spent almost $1 million on official propaganda extolling his
administration's work during his last five months in office and
more than half the money went to media outlets owned by his family.
   _Around 1987, a state bank exchanged a debt of $124,000 with the
family-owned business TV Gazeta for free commercials on the station
as well as on three radio stations and for advertisments in a
newspaper owned by the family.
   _He spent more than $1 million in state money intended for
emergency expenditures _ more than 5,000 percent above what was
budgeted _ from January to May and some of the money was used to
buy gifts of flowers, crystal and silverware for friends and
political colleagues.
   The charges run head-on with Collor de Mello's image as an
austere corruption fighter who cracked down on politicians and
public servants.
   Collor de Mello is best known for his refusal as governor to pay
the exorbitant salaries of an elite group of state employees, known
as ``maharajas.''
   Some of these functionaries, by combining two or three
government jobs but not really working at them, were amassing
paychecks of up to $10,000 a month in contrast to Brazil's montly
minimum wage of about $70.
   The battle with the maharajas is the centerpiece of Collor de
Mello's presidential campaign.
   He also has gained support by sharply criticizing President Jose
Sarney, who many Brazilians blame for soaring inflation of more
than 1,000 percent annually and rampant corruption.
   Direct presidential votes were banned by a right-wing military
regime that ruled the country from 1964 to 1985. Sarney, the first
new civilian chief, took office in March, 1985, following a vote by
an Electoral College made up of congressmen and state
representatives.
   Collor de Mello's campaign office has provided literature
responding to some of the allegations against the candidate.
   According to the material:
   _The contract with Zelia Cardoso de Mello was legal. No bidding
was necessary, as she was clearly qualified for the job.
   _With Collor de Mello as governor, Alagoas was among the three
states that spent the least on official propaganda. What
advertising occurred was placed where it would reach the biggest
audience.
   _Emergency funds spent were ``modest,'' and a good part of the
money went to worthy projects such as health care and housing.
Flowers were bought for receptions for visiting dignitaries.
   Herbert de Souza, of the Brazilian Institute of Analysis and
Statistics, said Collor de Mello's popularity will be seriously
tested with the free television time given the major candidates on
all networks.
   ``The other candidates are using their TV time to go after
Collor de Mello, and most people are now going to hear the
allegations of corruption against him for the first time,'' Souza
said.

<HEAD>Solar Storm Makes Northern Lights More Spectacular</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A geomagnetic storm battering the Earth's
poles is growing increasingly violent, and northern lights
researchers call it the best thing that's ever happened to them.
   The storm, caused by the bombardment of energy from solar
activity, is making the shimmering aurora borealis brighter, more
colorful and more spectacular than usual this year.
   Unni Pia Loevhaug, a space researcher, plans to fire bolts of
electricity at the ionosphere, the layer of Earth's atmosphere that
acts like a movie screen for the solar lights, to get an even
better picture.
   The study should offer insights into the universe and theories
of physics and ``increase man's storehouse of knowledge,'' she said.
   Her work may have practical applications in helping to overcome
the havoc that the electrically charged lights can play with radio
communications and navigation.
   In Tromsoe, 185 miles north of the Arctic Cicle, the tourism
board is thankful for the aurora borealis, which has drawn the
curious and adventurous for hundreds of years.
   These amazing sheets of light are the offspring of solar winds,
bursts of energized atomic particles that sweep 93 million miles
through space and slam into the Earth's magnetic field at a speed
of 1.56 million miles an hour.
   The collision releases the storm of energy seen in the
constantly changing lights. Over the South Pole they are called the
aurora australis.
   ``It's absolutely the most fantastic thing we have up here in
the north,'' said tourist official Gunn Sissel Jaklin.
   ``The aurora will just keep getting better and better from now
until 1994 because the 11-year solar cycle is moving toward a
peak.''
   Space researcher Loevhaug keeps tabs on the lights summer and
winter, even when they are dimmed or hidden by the midnight sun.
   ``We're already seeing things that I have never witnessed
before,'' she said. She has studied the lights since 1983.
   From her laboratory 18 miles outside town, the 33-year-old
physicist is taking part in European Incoherent Scatter Radar
(EISCAT), a project launched in 1981 to study the northern lights
and the Earth's outer atmosphere.
   EISCAT's studies are funded by Britain, France, West Germany,
Norway, Sweden and Finland.
   A transmitter fed by five megawatts of power, enough to light a
small village, bounces a radar beam off the ionosphere 30 to 1,250
miles above the Earth. Signals are picked up in Sweden and Finland
and relayed to Tromsoe.
   ``A radar wave is an electromagnetic field,'' Loevhaug said.
``It scatters through the northern lights and we receive a picture
of what is going on. When solar activity builds up, it amplifies
the lights and makes our studies easier.''
   It took centuries for mankind to discover that solar flares,
tongues of fire that leap thousands of miles above the sun's
surface, caused the lights.
   The Vikings believed the lights were flashes from the shields of
warriors bound for heavenly Valhalla. Eskimos imagined dangerous
spirits, while Swedes thought it was the torchlight of Lapps
stalking stray reindeer.
   Centuries ago, Tromsoe's people feared that laughing at the
northern lights would anger the gods, who would strike them lame.
   The aurora has sometimes been seen far south of the Arctic
Circle. It was mentioned in the Bible and pondered by Greek
philospher Aristotle 2,500 years ago.
   Even though lights are commonly seen in Tromsoe, ``a colorful
display makes everyone drop what they are doing to watch,'' said
Jaklin, the tourism official.
   ``They look fantastic even when you understand them,'' said
Loevhaug.

<HEAD>Conservative Movement a `Paper Tiger'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When we left Paul M. Weyrich, he had just
undermined President Bush's first choice for secretary of defense.
Now he has decided to rebuild the American conservative movement
from the bottom up, using the tactics of Mao Tse-tung.
   That sounds unlikely, but it is no less plausible than the
undoing of John G. Tower, the former Republican senator from Texas,
rejected by the Senate for secretary of defense last winter after a
controversy that surfaced when Weyrich accused him of misbehaving
with women and whiskey. He said his testimony against another
conservative stemmed from concern about Tower's character and about
leadership at the Pentagon.
   Weyrich says he is asked about the Tower episode at his
organizing and fundraising appearances for his Free Congress
Foundation, but that other conservatives haven't been critical,
only curious. Nor, he said, have there been any lingering problems
in his contacts with the White House.
   And conservative business seems to be thriving. Weyrich's
organization raised $3.34 million last year, has a staff of about
55, and has just expanded its row of small office buildings near
the foot of Capitol Hill.
   But while his outfit has prospered, Weyrich says the
conservative movement has declined in political power over the past
10 years. He blames a sort of Potomac fever on the right, and says
he was guilty of it himself.
   Because of it, Weyrich said in an interview and in a monthly
newsletter sent to about 600 leading backers of his operation,
conservatives have lost clout in precinct, congressional district
and state politics.
   He calls it a confusing time for conservatives who think they
are making ideological headway but can't convert that into
political action. As an example, he points to the Supreme Court
decision permitting state legislatures to restrict abortions, a
victory for the right _ if abortion foes can get legislatures to
take the next step. ``They are absolutely unprepared for that
battle,'' Weyrich said.
   Weyrich contends that liberals are outnumbered now, but can win
political and legislative fights because their forces are organized
and disciplined for state and local campaigns. Conservatives, he
said, started moving people and political operations to Washington
when Ronald Reagan became president.
   Mao ``was correct in one thing he said: `In any revolution, take
the countryside and the capital will fall,''' Weyrich told his
backers. ``Our strength is not in Washington. Yes, we had and have
influence here, and we helped to change certain policies. But we
have not had real power ...
   ``We will only be powerful in Washington when we once again
speak for a powerful movement outside Washington _ when we have
taken the countryside,'' he wrote them.
   Weyrich said he plans to test his operation first in Wisconsin.
He and his cadre went to Madison last weekend, to meet, he said,
with 25 leaders of organizations identified with conservative
causes, and then to begin training about 75 people in political
operations.
   ``Recently, a high White House official who is sympathetic to
our view described the conservative movement ... as a paper
tiger,'' Weyrich said. ``Unfortunately, he is close to the mark.
   ``But it need not be so,'' he said. ``We are only a paper tiger
because we are not organized.''
   President Bush never has been a favorite with doctrinaire
Republican conservatives; they didn't want him on the Reagan ticket
in 1980 and they didn't want him nominated in 1988. Indeed, Weyrich
told his supporters that Bush's 1988 primary victories were
evidence of conservative weakness.
   But he says that a politically strengthened conservative
movement would strengthen the president's hand in dealing with
Congress. ``Nobody's talking about taking on George Bush,'' he said.

<HEAD>``Peanuts'' Gang Hits Middle Age</HEAD>

   Good grief! Charlie Brown is 40 years old?
   Yep. Charlie and the rest of the ``Peanuts'' gang hit the Big
Four-O, a midlife plateau that usually sets off a good deal of
soul-searching in most folks.
   Just don't expect to see it mentioned in the award-winning strip.
   ``A comic strip should not make self-conscious statements,''
says Charles Schulz, 67, creator of the ``Peanuts'' characters who
appear in more than 2,000 newspapers in 68 nations. ``There will be
nothing in the strip.''
   But that hardly means the milestone will pass unnoticed. An
exhibition is slated for the Louvre in Paris, and half time at the
Super Bowl next January will feature a birthday extravaganza.
   Most importantly, the story of Charlie, Snoopy, Lucy, Linus and
friends can finally be told. The whole truth comes out in the shy
cartoonist's biography, ``Good Grief: The Story of Charles M.
Schulz.'' It's due out October 12 from Pharos Books ($17.95).
   The book, by Rheta Grimsley Johnson, is a first, says Phyllis
Henrici of Pharos, a sister company of the Scripps Howard newspaper
chain. Schulz draws for the United Features Syndicate, a Scripps
Howard subsidiary.
   ``Publishers have wanted to do a biography of him for years, but
he hasn't wanted to authorize one,'' she said.
   What made the difference this time?
   ``I liked her right away,'' Schulz said of Johnson, a columnist
for the Memphis Commercial Appeal.
   Good thing, too. There's no apprentice or designated cartoonist
working for Schulz who can tell the tale some day.
   ``When I retire that's the end of the strip,'' said Schulz.
``It's in my contract.'' Also in his contract is the clause, ``was
mainly my children's idea,'' said Schulz, a father of five. ``They
didn't want anyone but dad drawing it.''
   It is a strip that's become a household name, and one that's
brought Schulz international fame. He won the Rueben Award, comic
arts highest honor, in 1955 and 1964. In 1978, he was named
International Cartoonist of the Year, an award voted by 700 comic
artists around world.
   The CBS Special ``A Charlie Brown Christmas'' won a Peabody
award in 1966.
   Charlie Brown, the round-headed kid who seems to court bad luck,
was named after a friend at art school and is Schulz's alter ego.
Snoopy was inspired by a dog he had as child. The other characters
all have distinct personalities and eccentricities.
   Somehow the strip wouldn't be the same if Charlie actually
kicked the football _ or Lucy didn't yank it away.
   Schulz studied art when he was in high school, after he saw a
``Do you like to draw?'' ad.
   ``The truth is, I wasn't a very good student,'' he said.
   His first professional job was doing lettering for drawings in
Timeless Topix, a Catholic comic book. He later taught at the Art
Instruction School, and sold cartoons to the Saturday Evening Post.
   His cartoon feature, ``Li'l Folks,'' which was the start of
Peanuts, was developed for St. Paul Pioneer Press in 1947. The
strip was sold to a syndicate in 1950, and the name changed to
``Peanuts.''
   The artist, whose income for 1987-88 was estimated by Forbes at
$62 million, is almost a natural resource in the wine country city
of Santa Rosa, about 80 miles north of San Francisco.
   He spends much of his time at his Redwood Empire Ice Arena,
where he frequently plays hockey or sips coffee at the rink's Warm
Puppy snack bar.
   The actual drawing of the strip takes place in his office at One
Snoopy Place, a single-story, stone-and-redwood building. It's
appropriate that the little beagle's monicker got the nod for the
office. It was the Snoopy and Red Baron episodes that really put
the strip into orbit.
   Snoopy, until then just another pet pooch, became a World War I
flying ace in October 1965 and piloted the strip to its pinnacle.
   ``It worked beautifully, so beautifully that nothing can be
expected to duplicate it,'' Johnson recounts.
   Although the book contains stories about all the strip's
characters, the most interesting is about a character never shown _
the ``little red-haired girl'' who is Charlie Brown's unrequited
love.
   ``Peanuts'' began syndication on Oct. 2, 1950, 19 days after
Schulz' proposal of marriage was turned down in his native St.
Paul, Minn., by Donna Mae Wold, the original red-haired girl.
   ``It's heartbreaking,'' said Schulz, who proposed five years
after plowing across France in a half-track as an infantryman
during World War II. ``It's something you never get over, but I
think the only purpose in recounting the story was to show how
experience prompts a cartoonist's ideas.''
   Johnson, whose book discloses that the artist suffers from
depression, says Schulz' life contains many rejections he
translated to the strip.
   ``Rejection is his specialty. Losing his hobby. He has spent a
lifetime perfecting failure,'' she said.
   At first Johnson thought the artist was kidding about Wold's
turning him down. ``He talked about it as if it took place last
year,'' she said in an interview.
   Along with depression, the artist also has bouts of agoraphobia,
the fear of being alone in public places from which escape might be
difficult.
   ``The sight of a hotel lobby, for example, puts Schulz in a
sweat,'' writes Johnson.
   Such fears and troubles are too bad, says the author. Yet, there
would not be Schulz' ``unique gift to the world without the
sensitivity that so limits his personal life.''
   And what does ``Peanuts'' mean to Schulz?
   ``This is my whole life,'' he said. ``I pour my heart into this,
every day, and some people don't even read the comics.''

<HEAD>Italian Official Creates Fuss Over Saving Leaning Tower of Pisa</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto planned</HEAD>
<HEAD>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PISA, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The tower of Pisa has been leaning for 800
years, so the keeper of the marble wonder can't understand what all
the latest fuss is about.
   It's true that experts have been making dire predictions for
years. But there was a real tower tizzy after the minister of
public works, Giovanni Prandini, sounded an alarm recently that
scared all of Italy.
   Newspapers immediately published headlines warning of a ``red
alert'' for the tower, raising fears that one of the symbols of
Italy could, at worst, topple, or at best, be closed for repairs.
   But Giuseppe Toniolo, chairman of the committee responsible for
preservation of the monument, says there's nothing to get excited
about.
   ``There is absolutely nothing new in the situation,'' he said in
an interview. ``To say that the tower is in danger, so what? It's
always been in danger.''
   ``What does the tower need?'' Toniolo added. ``It needs to be
left in peace.''
   The 180-foot circular tower, begun by Bonnano Pisano in 1173,
started to tilt almost immediately because the ground shifted
underneath. It was completed by Tomasso D'Andrea with the
construction of the belfry between 1360 and 1370.
   The tower now leans about 13 feet off the perpendicular, but
Toniolo and other tower experts say it would not topple for more
than another century if it continues to tilt at its average rate.
   According to the last measurement in June, the tower leaned an
additional 0.008 inches in the last 12-month period. The average
yearly tilt since the measurements began in 1918 is 0.047 inches.
   ``The thing should fall over,'' Toniolo said, seated behind a
desk in his office, the tower visible through Gothic windows. ``How
long will this lean last? No one can say. But at a certain time, it
will reach the point where it falls. That will take more than 100
years. It could be 200, 250 years.''
   For decades, Italy has tried to come up with ways to save the
tower. A number of national and international commissions have
proposed plans for stabilizing the monument, but none has ever been
implemented.
   ``The problem of trying to stabilize the tower is enough to make
the hands of great technicians tremble,'' said Gero Geri, a
topography professor who has been measuring the lean of the tower
since 1969. ``Who wants to risk doing something that could upset
the equilibrium?''
   The latest plan, approved by the government in 1987, is to
implant a wheel-shaped support below the base around the tower. It
would be connected by concrete spokes to the marble foundation.
   The Public Works Ministry appointed a commission a few months
ago to study the soil conditions to determine whether the plan can
go ahead.
   But Toniolo believes the tower can't be fixed until officials
figure out what has kept the 14,000-ton structure standing all
these years.
   ``All the technicians say it can't be understood,'' said the
white-haired, 80-year-old retired radiologist who has headed the
monument preservation committee for 12 years. ``This means there
are special conditions of the terrain which haven't yet been
explained. If you can't understand this, how can you do a project
to save it?''
   Prandini, a Christian Democrat who has been public works
minister for barely two months, apparently wants to find a solution.
   After expressing his concern over the state of the tower,
Prandini ordered a panel of technical experts to report back
quickly on the feasibility of a stabilization plan. He also told
them to devise a round-the-clock monitoring system for the tower.
   Mayor Giacomino Granchi, a Socialist, accused Prandini of
exaggerating the situation and trying to get publicity for himself.
   Prandini replied, ``I don't see why one wants to make a
controversy out of a well known problem only because there's the
will to act decisively and go from the study phase to concrete
realization.''
   The sense of urgency was heightened by the collapse in March of
the 900-year-old tower of Pavia in northern Italy, killing three
people. Experts said the 255-foot tower crumbled either because of
natural decay in the mortar holding the bricks together or because
of a sudden sinking following a dry spell that lowered the water
table.
   ``The example of Pavia doesn't count because no one ever
monitored it,'' Toniolo said. ``No other tower in Italy is
monitored like Pisa's. If Pavia had all the instruments that we
have, they would have known a few months before'' that it was in
danger.
   Toniolo said he receives an average of 40 proposals a year from
people around the world, mostly Americans, for saving the tower.
   The latest: erecting a huge statue of Saint Ranieri, Pisa's
patron saint, with arms raised to hold up the tower.
   Some even suggest trying to straighten the tower, a notion that
makes Toniolo shudder.
   ``Never, for heaven's sake,'' he said. ``It was born tilted. Our
ancestors built it that way eight centuries ago. It must remain
that way.''

   Slowly, the largest animals ever to roam the
planet are returning to the craggy coves and lofty fiords of
Newfoundland, beckoning the curious from across America and Europe,
as well as scientists who want to study them. While the seasonal
arrivals of the whales are met with some trepidation by fishermen,
Newfoundlanders are learning that a live whale can be just as
valuable as a dead one.

<TEXT>
   Spring comes late and winter comes
early to these climes, governing the coming and going of exotic
seabirds, moose, caribou and seals. But the creatures that linger
most on the mind are the whales.
   In fact, a group of scientists will gather in Newfoundland in
February under the auspices of Memorial University in St. Johns to
tally the number of humpback whales left in the world by comparing
thousands of photographs taken over the years of humpback tails,
which have telltale fluke patterns.
   Situated off the food-rich Grand Banks, where codfish is king,
the seas around Newfoundland provide enough food, deep water and
isolation to satisfy the pickiest leviathan.
   ``This is the biggest restaurant in the world's oceans. It's got
a varied menu, everything you want and all you want, and it's
cheap,'' says whale researcher Peter Beamish, who conducts
whale-watching expeditions out of Trinity.
   The waters off Newfoundland have the highest concentration of
whales in the world, says Beamish, who holds a doctorate in marine
bioacoustics from the University of British Columbia and a master's
degree from Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Up to 25 species
of cetaceans _ whales, dolphins and porpoises _ migrate every
summer to the northwest Atlantic to feed.
   ``If a place like Alaska is a fish-and-chips joint that seats 25
people, then this is the entire city of Paris, which seats 5
million people all eating gourmet, 15-course meals,'' Beamish says.
   But the waters around Newfoundland have not always been
hospitable to whales, whose numbers have been decimated by 500
years of relentless pursuit and slaughter by whalers from several
continents.
   Since the time of Columbus, the coastlines of Newfoundland and
Labrador were littered with makeshift whale factories, which were
moved from one site to another after whales in an area were
depleted.
   Whales were deemed expendable. The rendering of their blubber
provided light for the streets of Europe and food for Asia.
Observations of their habits were limited to those who hunted them,
almost to extinction.
   Since the turn of the century, more than 2 million whales have
been reported killed for food, oil, cosmetics and other products.
   But after the 1960s, the decade of increasing environmental
awareness, and the 1970s, the decade of discovery about the
intelligence and gentleness of whales, the 1980s have been a decade
in which most nations banned whaling _ at least temporarily.
   While tourists spend thousands of dollars to travel here to view
whales, the fishermen who spend the most time in the company of the
gentle giants view them more like city pigeons than a national
treasure.
   ``My stepfather is a fisherman and I can't go home and speak of
what a great day I had,'' says Collette Churchill, 21, of Port
Rexton, Beamish's assistant on the whale-watching expeditions. ``To
him, the whales are a nuisance. They get in their traps and cost
them a lot of money.''
   Whales often wreak havoc with expensive fishing nets, and
toothed whales compete for the capelin, squid and cod that
contribute to Newfoundland's $700 million fishing industry.
   ``For fishermen, whales are marine rats. It's a pest, an
endangered pest, because it really does cost them money,'' says
John Lien, professor of ocean studies at Memorial University.
   The provincial government and whale researchers such as Beamish
and Lien have been working diligently over the past decade to
create goodwill between whales and the fishermen.
   Educational programs about whales have been presented in just
about every village and outport _ tiny settlements reachable only
by boat. And when a whale gets trapped in a net, a toll-free hot
line can put a fisherman in contact with a rescue team that will
try to free the animal and save the net.
   ``In Newfoundland as a whole, attitudes have changed,'' says
Lien. ``We've printed a half million whale posters, and I claim
they have replaced Sears catalogs in the outhouses. Now 90 percent
of the fishermen can identify a humpback, for instance. Before, it
was a very low figure.''
   Before hot lines and whale rescues, one in two whales trapped in
fishing nets would die, Lien says. This year, only three of 65
humpbacks that blundered into nets died.
   ``When I first came here, live whales cost Newfoundland
fishermen over $1 million a year from lost or damaged nets and
all,'' Beamish says. ``And now tourism probably brings in $1
million a year to the island.
   ``What I did and what I'm proud of is that I came to
Newfoundland hoping to make live whales more valuable to
Newfoundlanders than dead whales. And we did that.''
   A new generation of Newfoundlanders also is emerging, one much
more atuned to the special creatures in their midst.
   ``We surveyed 7,000 kids in Newfoundland and found that seal
pups and whales were their favorite animals. They were right up
there with puppies and kittens,'' says Lien. ``That's probably the
most important thing an animal can do for its survival _ get humans
attached to it.''
   There are two kinds of whales, toothed whales like the dolphin,
sperm and killer whales, and baleen whales like the blue, humpback
and right whales, which feed on krill, tiny shrimp-like plankton,
gulped by the thousands while the water is expelled through a mesh
of whalebone called baleen.
   Some whales, like the rare blue whale, the largest animal ever
to have lived, can be seen in winter feeding near the edge of ice
floes along the island's undulating, 5,500-mile-long coastline.

   But most of Newfoundland's whales, notably humpbacks, minkes and
fins, breed and calve in warm southern waters during the winter and
migrate north in summer to feed on the millions of tiny smelt-like
capelin that spawn on Newfoundland beaches.
   ``North to feed, south to breed,'' says Beamish.
   With little exaggeration, that's just about all that's known
about these warm-blooded, air-breathing mammals. What they do at
night, how deep they dive, where they go in the winter, how they
communicate, how some species feed, why certain whales beach
themselves, how long they live, how often they give birth, even
whether some species still exist, are all mysteries.
   ``Whales are really mysterious animals because they seem to
disappear. They'll go down and you don't see them ever again,''
says Beamish, who spent 10 years at the Bedford Institute of
Oceanography.
   ``We know a fraction about whales of what we do about other
animals on Earth because we can't study them at nighttime, we can't
study them when they're below the surface, we can't study them in
captivity and we can't study them in the winter very well.''
   Nevertheless centuries of hunting whales have yielded some of
their secrets. The sperm whale for instance feeds mostly on squid,
preferably the giant squid and octopus. That requires that it dive
to great depths, although like all whales it is an air breather.
   One sperm whale, a relative youngster at 45 feet long, was found
at a depth of 3,240 feet by the cable repair ship All America in
1932. It drowned apparently in mortal combat with the cable it
encountered while hunting squid. Almost 200 feet of cable was
twisted around its jaws and body.
   While most whales have a gentle reputation, the killer whales
are the most formidable. Thirty feet long and capable of swimming
at about 30 mph, they are unmatched in lethal potential. They are
voracious, some caught with the remains of more than 20 porpoises
and seals in their bellies.
   But no whale challenges the imagination as much as the great
blue, protected now but once hunted almost to extinction. Some 100
feet long and 150 tons, it is the largest creature on Earth, and
may have begun its evolutional history on dry land. There are
vestigial hipbones in the rear third of its body indicating that it
may have prowled the primordial land.
   It was a boon to the whalers. One blue whale could yield 45 tons
of meat and 40 tons of blubber. Its skeleton alone weighed 27 tons
and its internal organs 18 more.
   Beamish, who moved to Newfoundland from Nova Scotia 10 years ago
to study whales more closely, says he sometimes gets frustrated at
the very thing that makes them so mysterious _ their elusiveness.
   ``Sometimes I feel like switching to an easier animal,'' he says
wryly. ``I do this as well as anybody in the world, so I'm on the
edge of knowledge. But you'd like to work on an animal you can work
with more than just a few hours a day.''
   Nevertheless, there is something about whales that makes them
special in the marine kingdom and attractive to scientists.
   ``They are highly intelligent, and their brains are extremely
unusual and as complex as ours,'' says Jennifer Bates of the Whale
Center in Oakland, Calif. ``Not only that, they arrived at their
brain size at least 2 million years before we attained ours.''
   ``They are at the top of the evolutionary ladder among ocean
animals and man is at the top among land animals,'' Beamish says.
``So even though you get less data, the data might be more
meaningful.''
   The body of knowledge about whales, for the most part, is a
recent acquistion _ begun only in the latter half of this century.
   The reason may be found in a little clapboard museum in historic
Trinity dedicated to the town's fishing and whaling past. Curator
Calvert Goldsworthy, a former fish-plant worker, fingers the long,
sinewy fibers of a humpback's baleen.
   Looking out the window at Trinity Bay, a favorite haunt of
whales, the slight man of 63 years remembers when fish plants
smelling of salt cod covered the rocky coast and recalls stories of
the carcasses of dead whales hauled ashore for rendering a century
before.
   In many parts of the globe, the animals are still scarce. Some
species, like the bowhead and right whale (so called by the whalers
because it would float when killed, therefore ``right'') are highly
endangered, while others, like Longman's beaked and the
melon-headed whale, have not been seen for decades.
   Slowly, the largest animals ever to roam the planet have
returned to the craggy coves and lofty fiords of this verdant
island. And their arrival in the spring is met with both eagerness
and trepidation by the local inhabitants.
   ``It means spring is here, just like when my animals have young,
when the first lamb is born,'' says Goldsworthy. ``The first whale
is like the first robin. The ponds start to melt and you take your
rod and go out for a meal of trout.''
   ``You get this burst of energy,'' says Collette Churchill.
``Research doesn't go so well on the first day because I can't sit
down. I still feel like that every morning with our first humpback
sighting.''
   Sitting at a table in the small restaurant of Beamish's Village
Inn, Churchill relaxes before the start of another day of
note-taking on rough seas. After several days of rain and fog _ an
obvious deterrent to whale watching _ the clouds part and the sun
warms the small, clapboard houses built haphazardly along the steep
slopes.
   ``You can't describe the feeling that goes over you when you see
a whale for the first time or a humpback breach,'' Churchill says,
her face beaming. ``It doesn't matter who you are, where you're
from. I don't see how you can't feel that way, such a big animal,
so friendly. It's like they have this need to communicate.
   ``They want to and are trying, it's just that no one understands
them.''

   Like a roller coaster stuck on go,
the 60-mph Zodiac raft assaults mile after mile of 12-foot swells,
startling puffins into diving for safety, as tourists pursue an
elusive minke whale.
   ``Blow, 2 o'clock,'' yells a passenger, pointing into a
sun-washed horizon as the curved, black back of the minke appears
for a split-second breath of air.
   Minutes elapse before the whale watchers, all peering intently
into the vast expanse of ocean, spy the sickle-shaped dorsal fin
that appears as a minke spouts.
   ``Blow, 6 o'clock,'' yell two people at once as the Zodiac makes
a quick left turn and veers out toward open sea.
   After two days of rain and fog, the participants in a three-day
whale-watch expedition in Newfoundland are eager to see what they
paid thousands of dollars and traveled thousands of miles to see.
   Their patience is rewarded this sunny day in late summer.
Several minkes make appearances in coves at the base of high, rocky
cliffs, and the group of seven whale watchers establish brief
contact with a solitary humpback, an endangered whale known for its
melodious songs.
   ``I felt totally overwhelmed by it all,'' says Wendy Davidson,
35, an English native teaching in Norway. ``You really felt as if
the humpback was there with us. She came and rolled right beside
the boat as if to say, `Look, aren't I lovely?'''
   ``I think we were relieved, actually, that we had seen what we
came here to see,'' says Paul Collins, 33, a stage technician for
the Royal Shakespeare Theater in Stratford on Avon, England.
   Whale enthusiasts gravitate to this remote Canandian province at
the easternmost edge of North America because of the abundance and
variety of whales that migrate here every summer.
   What they find is sometimes more than they expected _ seals,
bald eagles, Arctic seabirds, and, inland, caribou, bear and moose.
   What they get in programs like those run by whale researcher
Peter Beamish in the historic village of Trinity is a chance to
participate in experiments in human-whale communication.
   ``Most people's expectations are just to see a whale, and as
soon as they walk in the door we tell them that we do a lot more
than that. We try to get them involved in a communication
experience, which is a lot more valuable,'' says Beamish, who has
operated his Ocean Contact program for 10 years.
   Beamish conducts three- and seven-day expeditions costing up to
$1,000. Air fare is not included.
   Participants are fed and housed at an old inn in Trinity, where
evenings consist of whale-related slide shows, movies and
discussions. Days are spent at sea looking for and, hopefully,
``talking'' to whales.
   The talking actually consists of electronic beeps sent through
the water several times at certain intervals. A ``conversation''
develops when a whale responds, either by spouting, breaching,
slapping his tail or lifting his head above water. Participants
help work the equipment and scan the horizon for the whale's
response.
   In his ``Whale Watcher's Handbook,'' author Erich Hoyt says,
``Sooner or later, the serious whale watcher finds himself in
Newfoundland.''
   But serious whale watchers also are finding there's more to this
ruggedly beautiful island than just whales.
   ``People come here to see whales. That's one of the things on
the list, but it's not the only thing,'' says Dan Collins, chief of
visitor activities at Terra Nova National Park near Trinity. ``They
are also interested in seeing icebergs and the wide-open spaces.''
   ``Newfoundland is kind of like the last outpost,'' says Terra
Nova superintendent John Fulton. ``The frontier ethic that existed
in the United States is still here. You still go out and cut your
wood, get your moose or caribou and your fish.''
   Greg Taylor, 40, an Englishman teaching in the Netherlands, said
the whales and the promise of pristine country are what attracted
him to Newfoundland and Beamish's program.
   ``When I asked the travel agent if she could get me a flight to
Newfoundland, she said: `Nobody ever goes there. Why do you want to
go there for?' I said, `Great, then that's where I want to be.'''
   New York City woodworker Cathy Zadoretzky, 39, says she felt
renewed by such close contact with animals that, to her, symbolize
``the things we are not'' in a land that is ``an idealization of
what I think of as peaceful, beautiful country.''
   ``Whales are superior beings who live in the ocean, and we are
supposedly the superior beings on land. They are a great force who
live peaceably under the sea, but we are a destructive force, and
we are beginning to realize that it might cost us.
   ``They're our salvation. If we can save them, we are starting to
save ourselves.''

   It was once called the ``American Clyde,'' after
the Clyde River in Scotland, then a major shipbuilding center in
Europe. Now the Delaware River is losing the last of its once-proud
shipbuilding yards, partially because of a general slump in the
industry brought on by new government policies.

   When the unfinished hulls of two Navy ships
leave the yard of Pennsylvania Shipbuilding Co., the Delaware River
will be without a shipbuilding business for the first time in more
than 300 years.
   Since William West built the Amity in 1682, the year William
Penn came from England, companies putting together seagoing ships
have been a part of the Delaware River landscape. At one time or
another, there were 38 shipyards along the river and its
tributaries.
   It has been in decline here for decades, but spokesmen say a
national slump in shipbuilding, aggravated by new government
policies, really finished off a once-proud industry that was a
national leader.
   For example, John Fitch advertised steamboat trips along the
Delaware River 17 years before Robert Fulton ran his Clermont along
the Hudson. Some of the Civil War-era ironclad ``monitors'' were
built here.
   Delaware Valley shipyards built boats to defend the America's
Cup. In Wilmington, Del., the Pusey &amp; Jones shipyard built them for
trade on the Amazon River.
   In 1915, with war under way in Europe, American International
Shipbuilding Corp. built what was then the world's largest shipyard
_ 50 shipways employing 34,000 workers. It turned out 122 cargo
ships and troop transports in two years.
   The river was nicknamed the ``American Clyde,'' after the Clyde
in Scotland, then the center of European iron shipbuilding.
   The proud tradition continued down to 1960, when the huge
aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk was launched from the New York
Shipbuilding Corp. yard in Camden, N.J., right across the river
from the Philadelphia waterfront. That yard closed soon after and
is now being demolished.
   The Kitty Hawk is being modernized now in Philadelphia at the
U.S. Navy Yard, which does ship repair work but hasn't built a ship
from the keel up since 1971.
   The two ships the Navy ordered from Pennsylvania Shipbuilding
sit at the river's edge, one tied up in a slip and the other braced
in a dry dock and minus the bow, stern and deckhouse. A mortgage
agreement filed in the Delaware County Recorder of Deeds Office
gives the Navy title to four parcels of land owned by Penn Ship if
the company fails to pay for the costs of finding another company
to finish the work.
   Pennsylvania Shipbuilding was known as Sun Shipbuilding &amp;
Drydock when Sun Oil opened it in 1916 to guarantee a supply of
tankers. Over the years it built 674 oceangoing ships.
   Sun got out of the shipbuilding business in 1982 and sold the
yard to a Texas company that renamed it. It was later sold to three
Mobile, Ala., real estate developers.
   In May 1985, Penn Ship won a $222.4 million contract to build
two fleet oilers for the Navy, vessels that refuel combat ships at
sea.
   The Navy planned to buy 18 of the 677{-foot, T-AO-187 class
tankers eventually, and Penn Ship stood to gain a good share of
that business if it completed the contract successfully.
   It didn't. The Navy renegotiated the contract to $331.4 million,
but Penn Ship announced in February that it didn't have enough
money to finish the ships with the cost overrun factored in.
   Work stopped on the ships and Penn Ship laid off 1,200 workers.
Rumors have said the hulls, one 90 percent finished and the other
70 percent done, will be towed to either Tampa, Fla., or New
Orleans to be finished.
   William Gallagher, the yard's general manager, couldn't say what
would become of the unfinished ships.
   ``The contract has been terminated,'' he said. ``We are not
involved with where they will go. I have no idea when they will
leave.''
   What went wrong? Why couldn't the yard finish a couple of
tankers, basically like ships that were built here for years?
   ``There were a lot of circumstances contributing,'' Gallagher
said. ``We bid in a time frame when labor rates were low. There was
also an expectation of follow-up work. Our costs turned out to be
much higher than we expected, and there was no follow-up work to
spread them over.''

   Nationwide, Gallagher said, shipbuilding is in trouble.
   ``There's no business,'' he said. ``The only new construction in
this country for the past couple of years has been for the
government.''
   Why?
   ``Aging facilities, and other countries' yards are subsidized,''
he said. ``It's impossible to compete in the world market the way
we're having to compete.''
   The U.S. maritime administration once subsidized the
construction of new vessels, but those subsidies have been
terminated, Gallagher said.
   In Washington, John Stoker of the Shipbuilders Council of
America agreed in part.
   ``For purposes of discussion, it's fairly accurate,'' he said.
``You can just watch the downward trend.''
   In 1982, the council counted 110 shipbuilding companies in the
United States, employing 112,000 workers. This year it's down to 69
companies employing 72,000.
   ``We lost 41 shipyards and 41,000 people,'' Stoker said.
   Shipbuilding in the Seattle area has been devastated in recent
years, Stoker said. Other areas that were hit hard were south
Texas, Baltimore and the San Francisco area.
   The Reagan administration terminated shipbuilding subsidies,
Stoker said, arguing that the government shouldn't be interfering
in the private sector, propping up the industry.
   ``But that was looking at the world through naive and myopic
lenses,'' he said. ``It doesn't recognize that if we are not
subsidized and the rest of the world is, we are doomed.''
   What saved American shipbuilding through the '80s, Stoker said,
was rebuilding the Navy. With that almost complete, American
shipyards face tough times again.
   Rather than asking the government to return to subsidies, the
council wants the major shipbuilding nations _ South Korea, Japan,
West Germany and Norway _ to drop government intervention in the
business.
   The council filed a complaint in June with the Office of the
United States Trade Representative against the four. It agreed to
withhold the petition while the United States tried to negotiate an
agreement on shipbuilding subsidies.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills agreed to seek agreements
with U.S. trading partners both through the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development and through the Uruguay Round
negotiations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   ``I have received assurances from representatives of all these
countries that they will negotiate seriously on this matter,'' she
said.
   Ms. Hills set a deadline of March 31, 1990, which Stoker called
``fairly aggressive.''
   ``But we can't really allow the process to drag on,'' Stoker
said. ``A number of our companies are potentially in trouble.''
   Stoker agreed it will not be easy to persuade other governments
to stop subsidizing shipbuilding.
   ``It depends on how you define a subsidy,'' he said. ``They tend
to think of a subsidy as a direct payment from the government to a
business. But when they make export credit available to a shipyard,
they don't think they're subsidizing it.''
   Gallagher is pessimistic.
   ``Those countries have decided they want to maintain a
shipbuilding industry,'' he said. ``In this country, we've
apparently made the decision not to have one.''
   Stoker is more optimistic. The nation still has areas where
employment is high in ship construction and repair _ the Gulf
Coast, San Diego and the area around Hampton Roads in Virginia.
Other big yards are in Connecticut, Rhode Island and Maine.
   U.S. trade negotiators have started talks with Japan and South
Korea, and Stoker said the major talks are expected in mid-October.
   ``We are hoping the U.S. negotiating position can be hammered
out later this month,'' he said. ``We frankly think some attitudes
about the shipbuilding industry in the nation have changed.''

   The last working commercial shipyard in
Pennsylvania was started by an oil executive making sure his
company had enough tankers. It went out of business trying to
finish a pair of military fuel ships.
   Sun Oil Co. incorporated Sun Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock Co. in 1916,
a year after company President J. Howard Pew had taken a business
trip to Germany and been impressed with that country's naval
strength.
   Sun Ship's first vessel, the SS Chester Sun, slid down the ways
in October 1917. By the end of World War I the yard had built six
tankers plus three minesweepers for the Navy.
   Over the years Sun Ship emerged as one of the nation's largest
privately owned shipyards. Its Sun Doxford diesel engine eventually
made it the biggest American manufacturer of large marine diesel.
It also launched the first all-welded tanker, the SS White Flash,
in 1931.
   But its glory years were during World War II, when an average of
a ship a week rolled down its 28 ways. On one day, the yard
launched three ships.
   By the end of the war, Sun Ship had produced more than 250 ships
_ 40 percent of all U.S. tankers built. It converted, armed and
repaired 1,000 more. The yard employed 33,500 people.
   But the end of the war brought a sharp decline in ship
construction. The other yards on the Delaware River began closing
and by 1975 only Sun Ship was left. By the end of 1980, the parent
Sun Co. estimated it had lost more than $200 million keeping the
shipyard alive.
   Sun announced it was getting out of the shipbuilding business in
January 1981. A company official estimated the shipyard would be
sold for $30 million to $40 million.
   In February 1982 the yard and its assets were sold for a
reported $8 million to Levingston Industries Inc., a Texas company
that renamed the yard Pennsylvania Shipbuilding. Levingston sold
control two years later to three real estate developers from
Mobile, Ala.
   But shipbuilding hasn't been very successful for Penn Ship. In
May 1985, when the Navy awarded the contract for two 677{-foot
fleet oilers, it was hailed as a deal that would keep the yard
alive.
   Later, Penn Ship would argue that it had to submit an
unreasonably low bid to get the contract and the Navy renegotiated
the deal to $331.4 million. In February, Penn Ship said that wasn't
enough either, and it suspended work with an eye to hiring another
yard to finish the job.
   Finally the Navy decided to find a new contractor itself.
   William Gallagher, the yard's general manager, said Penn Ship
made its bid when labor was plentiful and rates were low but soon
had trouble finding qualified employees in a booming economy.
   How could a shipyard that built tankers for years lose a
contract to build a couple of Navy fuel vessels? Michael Shaffer,
business agent for Local 802 of the Boilermakers Union, says the
company made a mistake by hiring Japanese consultants to introduce
``modular'' construction techniques.
   In traditional shipbuilding, workers build the hull and install
mechanical and electrical equipment inside the cramped confines.
The new technique has workers completely build entire sections and
then weld or bolt them together.
   ``That's one thing we're bitter about,'' Shaffer said. ``We've
been building 50-ton units and lifting them into place for years.
The Japanese didn't show us anything we didn't know already. But
the company treated them like gods while they treated their own
employees like dirt.''
   Gallagher disagrees.
   ``The modular techniques helped,'' he said, insisting that the
shipyard's troubles would have been even worse without them.
Absenteeism wasn't especially a problem, Gallagher said, but hiring
skilled workers was.
   ``That's really true throughout the country,'' he said. ``The
shipbuilding industry used to have a lot of skilled people. Most
shipyards used to have apprentice programs, and they were major
employers. Those people have left and found work in other areas.
   ``These are people in the skilled trades _ electricians, sheet
metal workers, machinists and so on _ and they don't have any
trouble finding new jobs. If you have to build up again, you have
to start over.''

   Lifesaving drugs are often available in France
long before they are on the market in the United States. The reason
is a difference in the bureaucracies of the two countries. While
some argue that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration should speed
up its drug approval process, others warn that it's risky to be
hasty.

   In 1985, a desperately ill Rock Hudson was one of
many AIDS patients who fled to France for a drug they couldn't get
in the United States.
   The drug didn't work. But at the time it was the only hope, and
American doctors couldn't prescribe it.
   Last year, French doctors began prescribing the so-called
abortion pill to terminate pregnancies. American women may not get
it for years.
   These are two examples among many in which the French became the
first to receive the potential benefits of new drugs.
   It happens because the French drug approval system is simpler
and faster than that of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
Advocates of the French system say it has elements that could be
adopted in the United States, cutting the time that Americans must
wait for new drugs.
   The issue has become increasingly important as the FDA faces
growing pressure to speed the approval of experimental cancer and
AIDS drugs that might help patients who would otherwise be unlikely
to survive.
   The FDA has, in fact, responded to that pressure by speeding the
approval of the AIDS drug AZT. And on Sept. 28, it announced that
it was making a newer AIDS drug, called DDI, widely available while
tests of its safety and effectiveness are still continuing.
   Defenders of the FDA argue the French system has certain
drawbacks that would make it unworkable in the United States.
   The French system is faster ``because it's very different,''
says Jerome Halperin, former deputy director of drugs at the FDA.
In the United States, the drug approval process is subject to
enormous oversight by Congress and consumer groups, says Halperin,
who is now with the U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention, a private
organization that sets standards for drug quality, purity and
strength.
   Some public interest groups are calling for a speed-up in drug
approval, Halperin notes, at the same time that others are arguing
that the agency takes unnecessary risks by sometimes being too
hasty.
   The classic example of a drug being approved too quickly is
thalidomide, which caused severe birth defects after it was
approved in Europe in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The drug was
never approved in the United States.
   Oversight from Congress and the public interest groups
inevitably puts pressure on reviewers and slows down the
drug-approval process, Halperin says. Similar government and public
oversight does not exist in France.
   ``There is hardly ever anybody from the AP or The New York Times
looking over their shoulders,'' says Dr. Michael Weintraub, a
clinical pharmacologist at the University of Rochester School of
Medicine in Rochester, N.Y., who spent the 1980-81 academic year in
France studying its pharmaceutical approval process. ``Our system
is much more political.''
   Most Americans see that public scrutiny as important, even
though it might slow new drug approvals, Halperin says.
   Nevertheless, he says, there are examples of drugs that get
approved here before they get approved in other countries,
including some AIDS drugs.
   ``I think the FDA has gone remarkably far in making experimental
AIDS drugs available with as little administrative encumbrance as
possible,'' Halperin says.
   The principal difference between the French and American systems
is that while the FDA relies on an in-house staff of drug
reviewers, the French rely on an outside committee of expert
volunteers, says Dr. Yves Juillet, director of scientific affairs
for the French National Pharmaceutical Industry Association.
   Some of the volunteers are drawn from the drug industry itself.
That works well in France, Juillet says, but the use of drug
company scientists to review drugs in the United States would
likely draw allegations of conflict of interest.

   The French expert committee meets every other Friday morning to
review pending new drug applications. Individual committee members
present written technical reviews of each application and then the
committee makes its decisions.
   In cases in which unusual speed is needed, or in which research
results are especially complicated, the health ministry simply
invites additional experts to join the committee for a time.
   ``It doesn't cost a lot because people are not paid for that,''
Juillet said in an interview at Broussais Hospital in Paris, where
he practices medicine.
   A decision is generally rendered within a few months after a
company sends in its research reports. The health minister
rubber-stamps it.
   ``When I was there, the limit was four months, and I almost
never saw anything over four months,'' Weintraub says.
   In contrast, at the FDA ``some drugs are quicker than others but
by and large it's about 18 months'' for approval after a final
application has been submitted, Weintraub says.
   ``In the French system, everything is reviewed within an hour or
an hour-and-a-half in one day at one presentation,'' Weintraub says.
   The FDA also places great emphasis on certain studies considered
pivotal in demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of new drugs.
The most important thing the FDA could learn from the French would
be ``not focusing on the so-called pivotal studies, but looking at
all the studies and all the data,'' Weintraub says.
   One of the drawbacks of the French system, according to
Weintraub, is that the health ministry does little until research
is complete and the company is ready to ask for approval.
   The FDA requires a review of laboratory findings before it will
allow a new drug to be tested on humans. The French don't. Drug
companies simply inform the health ministry that human trials are
about to begin, and the ministry rarely intervenes.
   ``They can't guide you,'' Weintraub says. The FDA meets
regularly with drug companies testing new drugs to advise the
companies on what further research is needed for approval.
   In France, ``there are no contacts between the committee and the
companies until the file is through,'' Juillet says.
   When the file of research data is complete, Juillet, acting as
the industry representative, makes the company's case before the
committee. ``My mission is to be a witness and defend the companies
and give them information if there is a problem,'' he says.
   French drug companies have a much closer relationship with the
health ministry than American companies do with the FDA, Weintraub
says, ``because the reviewers don't work for the government; it's
not a `them-and-us' thing.''
   In contrast, FDA reviewers and drug companies often deeply
distrust each other. Company officials charge the FDA with dragging
its feet, while the FDA often blames delays on the inadequacy of
the companies' research.
   Juillet suggests the FDA should rely more on outside reviewers.
``I think the open system is a good thing, working with people on
the outside,'' he says.
   Dr. Charles Leighton, a senior vice-president at Merck Sharpe &amp;
Dohme Research Laboratories in Blue Bell, Pa., says one reason
French drug approvals are often faster is that the French have
decided that the benefits of speeding new drug approval outweigh
the risks.
   ``They realize there might be a risk,'' he says. ``If you're the
first country to approve a drug, you might be the first to see a
problem.''
   Weintraub says history shows, however, that the French have not
in fact been subject to more problems with drug side-effects than
have Americans. ``We aren't saved from every problem drug, nor are
they exposed to every problem drug,'' he says.
   Although he believes the FDA has much to learn from the French,
Weintraub praises the expertise of the FDA's reviewers. ``Everybody
respects those people. They're smart, hard-working. ... A lot of
countries will allow marketing of the drug once the FDA does.
   ``We are the benchmark, for good or ill.''

   The startling boom of heavy artillery
reverberates through the world's highest mountains where for five
years India and Pakistan have been fighting for control of an icy
wasteland. While neither side will say how many casualities they
have suffered, they estimate only one in three resulted from combat.

<TEXT>
   The Top of the World is the
battleground in a largely unknown and undeclared war raging between
India and Pakistan, a war in which wind, snow and ice often take a
greater toll than the enemy.
   At stake is national prestige and possession of the Siachen, a
Himalayan wasteland wedged between Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and
territory controlled by China.
   After more than five years of fighting and artillery duels over
what would appear to be a minor issue, India and Pakistan are
trying to end the costly war.
   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India and Pakistani Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto, confident they can do business, are
pushing to bury ancient animosities and move their countries into a
friendlier era.
   But while they talk of peace, huge artillery guns continue to
boom, each startling blast echoing through the stillness of the
cathedral-like mountains.
   Fifteen years ago few thought it possible to fight, let alone
hold ground, for years in the higher reaches of the Karakoram
mountain range, where lie the Siachen and more than half of the
world's 20 tallest peaks.
   Never had battles been fought for any length of time at heights
of up to 4 miles, breathing air that contains less than half the
oxygen at sea level and at temperatures that frequently drop to 50
degrees below zero.
   ``Climb a 21,000-foot mountain anywhere else in the world and
you get an award,'' Brig. Gen. V.R. Raghavan, commander of the
Indian troops, told foreign journalists flown to the base camp at
the mouth of the Siachen and then taken by helicopter up the
45-mile-long, 6-mile-wide glacier.
   The number of casualties on both sides remains a military
secret, although Raghavan estimated only one-third are actually due
to combat.
   ``There are natural limits to this conflict _ the weather and
the terrain,'' he said. ``Here one has to fight constantly and even
more doggedly to survive. So much depends on so few and death can
be just one false move away.''
   The conflict's roots can be traced to the 1947 partition of
Moslem Pakistan and India, which is predominantly Hindu.
   Both countries have coveted the 85,000 square miles of
Jammu-Kashmir, a predominantly Moslem state that acceded to India.
   The dispute led Pakistan to grab about one-third of the
territory. In 1949, the two countries signed an agreement that drew
a cease-fire line that stopped at the southern foot of the Saltoro
range running along the glacier's western edge toward the Chinese
border.
   Negotiators did not extend the line because there was no
fighting in the region and glaciers were difficult to demarcate.
Although there were minor adjustments following the 1965 and 1971
India-Pakistan wars, the question of Siachen was left unresolved.
   Almost from the beginning, India has said it is entitled to
control all of Kashmir. Pakistan, however, says it has controlled
the Siachen all along, citing mountaineering expeditions that for
years sought its permission to enter and atlases published in the
United States and Britain in the early 1980s that showed the area
under its control.
   India first deployed troops to the Siachen in April 1984, a move
it said was merely to pre-empt a planned Pakistani strike.
Islamabad denied the charge.
   The conflict slowly escalated, with each side deploying
thousands of soldiers, erecting outposts and setting up bigger,
more powerful artillery.
   In the winter of 1987, Indian troops abandoned a 20,000-foot
outpost on Bilaford, one of three key passes. When they returned in
the spring and found the Pakistanis had moved in, a fierce six-day
battle ensued, with both sides pounding the other with artillery.
   Pakistan retaliated three months later with its biggest strike
of the war, capturing one post and closing in on a second before
the Indians unleashed an artillery barrage.

   ``The secret to this conflict is to control the high ground, and
we do. Pakistan is on the lower slopes, and we can punish them
whenever necessary,'' Raghavan said as 130mm artillery guns fired,
reverberating through the canyons.
   ``We have just given them our reply for firing at one of our
posts.''
   Indian soldiers posted on the peaks and ridges keep watch day
and night for the other side's supply and patrols columns.
   It is a lonely existence for the soldiers, most of whom come
from the palm-fringed beaches of southern Kerala state or the
desert of western Rajasthan or the jungles of eastern Assam and
have never lived _ much less fought in _ a snowbound environment.
   ``This is the hardest place on Earth,'' said Modhival Iqbal, a
weary 23-year-old soldier who just completed four months of duty at
a 19,000-foot outpost.
   From the base camp, soldiers armed with ice picks, skis,
shovels, ropes and 65-pound backpacks trudge across the black
moraine, through knee-deep snow and over 200-foot crevasses and up
the walls of ice to their posts.
   But before leaving, each visits the cave-like enclave where
there are hung images of the Hindu gods Rama, Shiva and Ganesha, as
well as a portrait of Jesus Christ.
   ``Everybody who goes to the glacier comes here first and says
his prayers. It doesn't matter if he's Hindu or Moslem or
Christian,'' Raghavan said.
   The trek takes six to eight days, with brief rest stops at posts
along the way, before reaching the small outposts where the
soldiers live for months in bunkers dug deep in the snow.
   ``Every day up there is important because every day you survive
means you're one day closer to leaving,'' Iqbal said. ``It's not
just the Pakistanis. It's the blizzards, the howling winds, the
blinding glare of the sun off the snow. It's the avalanches and the
isolation.
   ``We have plenty of food and supplies, but not much else. Maybe
someday somebody will organize a society for the prevention of
cruelty to soldiers.''
   A month-long clash erupted in April when Pakistan allegedly
tried to establish a new post within easy firing range of the
Indians and both sides dispatched soldiers to an icy 21,300-foot
peak. Pakistan, however, said it had only discovered an old
observation post.
   Accounts of what happened differ, but the Indians apparently
requested a meeting between the two opposition commanders. After
three sessions both sides agreed to pull back and the Indians
agreed to accept the post the Pakistanis had said was there all
along.
   With India commanding most of the heights along the Saltoro, it
now wants that boundary to serve as the northern extension of the
line that divides most of Kashmir between India and Pakistan.
   Since January 1986, the two governments have met five times to
discuss withdrawing their troops from the glacier and to consider
declaring the region a demilitarized zone.
   Pakistan officials believe the eventual withdrawal of Indiain
troops would be a major victory for Ms. Bhutto and a vindication of
their position that India started the conflict by sending troops
into an undemarcated area.
   Both Pakistani and Indian officials say the rapport between
Gandhi and Ms. Bhutto is helping but it still may be difficult for
either to yield. Gandhi is only months away from facing a national
election. Ms. Bhutto is in an even stickier situation, facing
criticism at home from opposition leaders who accuse her of
submission to India.
   While their leaders struggle to find a political solution, both
sides contend they can hold out indefinitely.
   ``Whether there is a settlement is a matter between state and
state,'' Raghavan said. ``Until then, we have a job to do. That
doesn't mean we want to stay here forever. Who would? But we can
stay here as long as we have to.''

   Since the Rev. William Blackstone settled on the
side of Beacon Hill in 1630 and cleared paths that jokesters later
said followed the route of his cow's wanderings, Boston has been
undergoing change. The city's current effort to remake itself began
in the mid-1970s and Bostonians today don't have to sleep 100 years
to feel like Rip van Winkle.

   Boston is trying to preserve its colonial heritage
and intimate scale while riding into the 21st century on a
bulldozer.
   Office towers are going up, and up. Old ones are coming down or
being remodeled. Elevated roads are going underground. The water in
Boston Harbor is on its way to the cleaners.
   Take a walk and see.
   The heart of downtown Boston still beats along narrow streets
lit by gas lamps and threaded between 19th century brick buildings.
Out along the Charles River, boulevards of the Back Bay repeat this
image on a grander scale with tall, graceful row houses built with
bay windows and front yards framed by cast-iron fences.
   But rising beside this embrace of the past are elegant 20th
century buildings that blend Boston's antiquity with the pride of
new money.
   Stroll out to Rowe's Wharf. Built on the ruins of a pier, the
hotel and condominium complex is graced by an immense open archway
to the harbor. Though just a few years old, admirers often assume
the handsome building is a well-preserved old masterpiece.
   Amble through the nearby financial district. Renovators dusted
off art deco embellishments on the buildings. Whimsical gold-leaf
accents climbing up the granite face sparkle on a new office tower
at 75 State St.
   Take a ride on the subway to any number of remodeled train
stations turned into vaulted cathedrals of glass and steel.
   Stand on a tree-shaded corner of Boston Public Garden, a park
evocative of the city's British roots, and gaze at a
brick-and-glass palace of condominiums. Called Heritage on the
Park, this new building's towers and wings blend so artfully with
its authentically aged surroundings it might have been there all
along.
   Conventioneers no longer visit the cramped and forgettable Hynes
Auditorium. There is a new bolder structure that sits long and low
with a grandeur more appropriate to a city that acknowledges its
power and ambitions.
   More than the skyline is in upheaval.
   Downtown in Boston, top-of-the line department stores occupy
shining new towers of commerce that cater to the city's new wealth
in its shift from industry to a service economy. The mannequins in
the windows of Bonwit Teller and Neiman-Marcus reach to the new
upper class with outstretched arms clad in designer fashions.
   Gritty Charlestown, home to historic Bunker Hill and witness to
racial violence when busing forced the integration of schools 15
years ago, is attracting affluent professionals. Working-class
natives are less than comfortable with the gentrified air these
newcomers bring.
   The once-vibrant Combat Zone is dying. A district that offered
X-rated films and strip shows to soldiers in wartime and to
business conventioneers more recently is coming down. Coming in are
refined office condominiums.
   In the South End, streets of stately row houses were claimed
long ago by a rich racial and economic mix of people. New moneyed
people, largely young and white, see in those homes an upscale
neighborhood waiting to happen.
   Renewed efforts to integrate public housing in mostly white
South Boston are forcing residents there to accept neighbors they
never dreamed of seeing across the fence.
   Boston has undergone change, whether from fire or changes in the
economic climate, since the Rev. William Blackstone settled on the
side of Beacon Hill in 1630 and cleared paths that jokesters later
said followed the route of his cow's wanderings.
   The city's current effort to remake itself began in the
mid-1970s. The churning, crashing and dust have been accelerating
ever since.
   ``A living city is never finished,'' says William Whitney, the
Boston Redevelopment Authority's assistant director for urban
design and development.
   ``Zoning is the principal tool of the city to implement its
policies. This is done with an eye to preserving the city's
intimate scale while accommodating the pressures of economic
vitality and growth.
   To date, a staggering 1,872 projects have been logged in the
authority's computer since 1975.
   In that time, the city has added or restored 59.4 million square
feet in floor space, from office suites and hotel rooms to housing
and parking lots. The price tag, in current dollars, rings up $14.4
billion.
   Major projects currently under way or on the drafting table
include:
   _Midtown Cultural District. This 20-block expansion of Boston's
tiny theater district would also overtake the Combat Zone.

   _Downtown Crossing. The city's chief shopping district is slated
for the biggest retail project in city history. Developers intend
to spend $600 million tearing down a mediocre and claustrophobic
4-year-old mall that looks more like a fortress than a shopping
arcade and replace it with a larger complex of department stores
and office space.
   _Depression of the Central Artery. This $4.5 billion job that
sounds like an unhappy medical procedure threatens to make life
miserable for motorists and businesses alike. The project,
scheduled for 1990 to 1998, will lower the major six-lane elevated
highway in Boston and make it an underground expressway. It also
would add a tunnel under Boston Harbor.
   Numerous other office and residential towers and projects are
planned. The New England Aquarium wants to move to Charlestown. A
new federal courthouse is proposed at Government Center. The Boston
Garden is slated to be replaced with a bigger and better sports
complex. The Prudential Center, which in the 1960s was in the
avant-garde of Boston's new look, is set for a makeover.
   The city involves not only developers and planners in its grand
designs but neighborhood groups, affected property owners and
history lovers.
   ``It's no more random development; it's calculated, managed
growth,'' says Antonia Pollak, executive director of the Boston
Preservation Alliance, a consortium of 33 preservation and historic
societies.
   ``We have learned how to protect and manage good architecture.
Not the character of 1630, but the character of contemporary
Boston: a combination of colonial, Victorian Boston with new
state-of-the-art structures.''
   ``This is a nation that has always loved change,'' said
architect and developer Peter Madsen, who is on the board of the
Boston Society of Architects, one of many groups guiding the city
in its constant transformation.
   For Boston to cease changing would take a cataclysm affecting
its widely diverse economy, a cornucopia of education, finance,
medicine, legal and other professional services and corporate
headquarters, he said.
   But for others, the handsome changes can be dizzying and
discomfitting.
   Tom Cunha is a 36-year-old machinist and a third-generation
resident of Charlestown.
   Like many of his fellow Charlestown residents, Cunha is learning
to adjust to life with the ``Toonies.'' That's the derisive name
locals give the moneyed people who began moving in after 1975, when
an elevated train came down and property values went up.
   ``Charlestown isn't a neighborhood of generations anymore,''
Cunha says. In the not-too-distant olden days, Charlestowners
married each other, he says. Their offspring grew up and began
Charlestown families of their own.
   ``A lot of the people who own places here now don't raise
families, they raise pets, plants and Porsches,'' Cunha says.
   The concerns of new people in the racial and economically
diverse South End seem to be getting more selfish, says Jeanette
Boone, who works in the Boston office of U.S. Sen. John Kerry.
She's troubled by the trend.
   ``The problem I have is when you move into a neighborhood that
has a history and people decide they want to change it, not having
a regard for it. They want to move the suburb into the city.''
   A homeowner for six years, Ms. Boone fondly remembers the South
End she first encountered.
   ``When we first moved to the South End, we were friendly and
people talked to us. Now, half the people you see wouldn't give you
the time of day.
   ``It was a neighborhood that had low-income blacks, Hispanics
and whites _ basically people who lived together and tried to get
along,'' Ms. Boone says.
   ``With some of the changes, people have no regard for the rich
history. We're finding a generation of people who are not as
caring, who care more about `my space' ... People of all colors,
all races, all kinds, have a right to live in a neighborhood. It
makes a neighborhood a lot richer.''
   Architecture critic and author Jane Holtz Kay grew up in Boston
and now lives in the Back Bay, where 20 years ago the distinctive
brick row houses were rooming houses, not small showcases for the
up-and-coming.
   ``I don't find the changes heartwarming,'' she said, referring
to the new demography. ``The diversity is evaporating. It's
becoming a city of the rich and the poor.
   ``I don't mean it was a kinder, gentler city, if you'll pardon
the expression ... But you wouldn't have seen $3,000 suits on the
street.''

   The painting of religious icons is an art form

   Philip Zimmerman paints mystical ``windows
to heaven,'' he says, haunting religious icons used as vehicles of
prayer.
   ``Icons are a very important part of the church,'' Zimmerman
says. ``They are a spiritual and physical depiction of some sacred
image _ of Christ or the Virgin Mary, a saint or some other
liturgical happening.''
   Icons, popular in the Eastern Orthodox Church, are painted in
rich, luminous colors. Faces are depicted with prayerful
expressions, and religious figures usually are crowned with halos
of real gold, not gold paint.
   Perpective and scale are distorted to give the religious scenes
a supernatural feel.
   Some regard icons simply as products of religious devotion or
art inspired by the Eastern Orthodox Church, which began the
tradition centuries ago.
   The religious regard icons as ``windows to heaven'' or
``theology made visible'' and believe focusing on them deepens
prayer and meditation, Zimmerman says.
   Zimmerman, 36, of nearby Johnstown, has been teaching two-week
classes in icon painting since last summer at Antiochian Village,
an Orthodox cultural center outside this mountain community about
60 miles east of Pittsburgh.
   The village, and the School of Sacred Arts in New York City, are
the only schools in the United States offering classes in icon
painting. Zimmerman says there are about 90 iconographers in the
United States and Canada.
   Students must learn to create within the strict conventions of
the art. They eventually develop their own styles while absorbing
hundreds of details on symbolism used in icons.
   For instance, halos _ blazing disks of golden light _ are
applied in gold leaf around the heads of divine figures to depict
emanations of radiant light.
   ``They are auras of spiritual holiness. Icons depict not just a
person's earthly image, but a spritual-type image as well,''
Zimmerman says. ``There is no light source like in other art. The
light source comes from within the figure.''
   Anatomical details such as facial features, fingers and body
shapes are stylized to give figures an additional aura of the
supernatural. Scenes are painted in two dimensions and no shadows
are cast.
   ``That's why in iconography, the icons do not look like real
people,'' Zimmerman says. ``We're not trying to make them look like
real people. It's a symbolic representation of a person.''
   Certain colors are associated with some religious figures.
Christ, for example, usually is depicted in blue and red.
   ``You usually never depict Christ in green,'' Zimmerman says.
``It's not traditional.''
   Iconographers say they technically do not paint icons, but
``write'' them. Artists are taught to create their works with
thousands of tiny caligraphic strokes.
   ``What they are are scriptural pictures _ pictures of the
scriptures,'' Zimmerman says. ``When you write the icon, you're
writing scriptures just the same as when you are using words.''
   Although the mechanics of the art are important, theology
debates often erupt during class sessions.
   ``It's very, very, very theological,'' Zimmerman says. ``There's
a lot of rules attached to this _ not a lot of painting rules, but
a whole lot of rules on what's proper, what's liturgical, what's
not liturgical.''
   Interest in icon painting has increased dramatically in recent
years, and not just among the religious.
   ``People here in the West are just beginning to discover the art
of the Orthodox church,'' Zimmerman says. ``It's not just something
Grandma brought over from Czechoslovakia.''
   ``I think the whole interest in religion is coming back,'' says
Steven Glazer, an official of the School of Sacred Arts.
   ``For a long time people were looking to Eastern religions and
Eastern mysticism. While that's still popular, people are returning
to their own traditions now.''
   Iconographer Vladislav Andreyev, who was born in the Soviet
Union, offers a 14-week class at the New York school, which also
offers classes on the art traditions of other religions.
   ``It's pretty international and we sell out every time. We
usually limit classes to 10 students,'' he says. ``Many of the arts
we teach are not available elsewhere.''
   Classes offered in the subject are short-term, but it often
takes years to develop competence, says Nicholas Papas, 30, an
iconographer from nearby Indiana.
   ``When I first started I was very timid and self-conscious,'' he
says. ``I was pretentious, boxed in and stiff. I feel that it took
me years to even begin to break out of that. I feel like I'm still
breaking out of that.''
   Papas began painting icons in 1979 and started full-time work as
an iconographer in 1982.
   Papas sells notebook-size icons of a favorite subject, such as
portraits of Christ, for as little as $175, but bigger and more
complicated works can be worth thousands of dollars.
   ``Every iconographer has his own idea of what he should get for
an icon,'' he says.
   Papas' icons usually are sold to churches or people who display
them in their homes. A giant mural of his is displayed 30 feet
above the ground in the dome of St. Mary's Byzantine Catholic
Church in nearby Homer City.
   A 70- by 12-foot mural Papas currently is working on, ``The
Communion of the Apostles,'' will attempt to depict what heaven
looks like.
   The idea of selling icons to people who admire them only as
works of art is a sticky ethical problem for some iconographers who
fear the buyer would be misusing a holy object.
   ``I would feel uncomfortable, but I would do it,'' says Papas,
who was born to an Eastern Orthodox family. ``Even if a person
asked me for an icon for the wrong reason, there's a possibility
that the icon could be a good influence on them.''
   Zimmerman began painting icons 18 years ago, while studying to
be an art teacher at Indiana University of Pennsylvania.
   An iconographer who served as the choir director of one local
Orthodox church recruited him and several of his college friends to
help him with his work.
   ``We made his job a little easier by filling in colors and stuff
like that,'' Zimmerman says.
   Also during college, Zimmerman decided to leave the Protestant
United Church of Christ to become an Eastern Orthodox Christian.
   ``I was always interested in religion, always interested in
exploring other religions as well,'' he says. ``I felt the Orthodox
Church was very satisfying. I felt this church has so much to offer
liturgically, spiritually, musically, artistically _ everything.''

   Fred Savage didn't set out to become an
actor, but now that he's become quite successful at the age of 13
he'd like to stick to it.
   Fred, who was nominated for an Emmy for his lead role in ABC's
hit comedy series ``The Wonder Years'' but didn't win, is a video
game hustler in the upcoming December release ``The Wizard.''
   ``I never really wanted to get into the business,'' he says.
``It was never a goal. It just happened.''
   It happened when he began doing commercials at the age of 6 in
his hometown of Chicago, where he lives with his family when he's
not working. He made his film debut at 8 in the movie ``The Boy Who
Could Fly.''
   ``I really enjoy acting,'' Fred says, now that he is a veteran
performer. ``I'd like to continue it for a while. I do want to go
to high school and college. I'd like to direct. On the set they
call me `Little Opie,' because Ron Howard started as a child actor
and grew up to direct. He could be a role model for me. I'm always
looking through the camera and checking angles. I want to learn all
I can.''
   ``The Wonder Years'' is the kind of show that will grow with
Fred. It made its debut in March 1988, and it has already changed
to reflect that Fred, as Kevin Arnold, is maturing and facing
different problems and challenges.
   ``The beauty of the show is that when my voice changes I can
still do the show,'' he says. ``Even if I get zits.''
   The beauty is also that virtually everyone can identify with the
adolescent traumas of Kevin, Paul, Winnie and their friends. The
time period this season has advanced to 1969, but its stories and
characters transcend time and place.
   ``I see Kevin as just a typical kid growing up in the late
1960s,'' he says. ``He's very shy. He has a non-stop fear of the
men in his family. His older brother's always beating up on him and
everyone's afraid of his dad.
   ``He's sort of insecure, especially around girls. But I think
he's a cool kid. He's a normal kid in 1969. This year he moves into
the eighth grade and has trouble with algebra and the algebra
teacher. This year his older brother learns to drive.''
   His favorite episode is the one in which Kevin accompanies his
father to his office.
   ``It's so true,'' he says. ``The exact thing didn't happen to me
but I went to my dad's office. I was so impressed watching him
work. I'd bring books to the office and copy the whole book on the
copy machine.''
   Fred, accompanied by his mother, is late for an interview. He
explains he had to complete work with his tutor for the public
school he attends in Chicago. He also explains that his father,
who's an industrial real estate broker, is back in Chicago.
   ``But they're not divorced,'' he quickly adds. They're merely
temporarily apart because of the requirements of his role on ``The
Wonder Years.''
   Fred has a younger sister, Kala, and a brother, Ben, who
appeared with him in his latest movie, ``Little Monsters.''
   In ``The Wizard,'' he and his younger brother head for a video
game championship. ``They're heading from Utah to the game in Los
Angeles,'' Fred says. ``They make money hustling other kids to play
video games. Their father's looking for them and their mother hires
a kind of bounty hunter.''
   The movie also stars Luke Edwards, Beau Bridges, Christian
Slater and Jenny Lewis.
   Fred first got into acting when notices in his Chicago
neighborhood asked for small children to audition for a television
commercial.
   ``The auditions were near our house and it sounded like fun,''
he says. ``So Mom and I went over. I didn't get it and six months
later the same director held another audition. I didn't get it
again. Six months later the director called and I was cast in a Pac
Man vitamins commercial.
   ``I did commercials for about two years, then I got into movies.
I did quite a few and I was in a TV series called `Morning Star,
Evening Star.' It only lasted six weeks.
   ``I was called in to read for `The Wonder Years' because the
producers had seen me in the movie `Vice Versa.' I flew to L.A. and
read for the network. I guess they approved because I got the part.
They ran the pilot after the Super Bowl in 1988 and we went on the
air in March.''
   The show won the Emmy last year as best comedy series after just
half of a season on the air. Fred never saw the Emmy telecast
because he was asleep when the show came on. He was in North
Carolina making the movie ``Little Monsters.'' His mother wouldn't
let him stay up.
   This year he was not only nominated as best lead actor in a
comedy, making him the youngest person ever nominated in a lead
role, but he was an award presenter with Carl Reiner.

   Before he returned to Broadway for the first
time in 25 years, Tony Randall wondered whether audiences would
forget television's Felix Unger long enough to accept him as the
tormented protagonist of ``M. Butterfly.''
   After all, Randall was Felix, the fussy, fastidious half of
``The Odd Couple,'' for five years on prime time television as well
as in nine stage productions with four different Oscar Madisons,
including his TV co-star, Jack Klugman.
   ``That question came up a million times,'' Randall recalled the
other day. ``Would they want to laugh instead?''
   He need not have worried.
   ``There's not a moment of rejection and having to win them
over,'' he says now, talking about his performance as Rene
Gallimard, the French diplomat who has an affair with a Chinese
opera singer. And theatergoers go along willingly with the more
bizarre plot developments in David Henry Hwang's Tony award-winning
play. Gallimard is seduced by the singer who turns out to be a man
masquerading as a woman.
   ``But then director John Dexter has set up the play so that when
the first voice comes out of this miasma of light and movement and
music, the audience is already captivated,'' the actor says. ``He's
the only director I ever worked with in my life who I thought was a
genius.''
   Randall is one of those actors who's not afraid of opinions.
   Asked why it has been more than 25 years since he has appeared
on Broadway, he says, ``No one's asked me.
   ``I've frequently had a year off or more and have noised it
around town that I was available. The fact that a man is a Broadway
producer doesn't make him any more intelligent than a network
executive.''
   Not that he hasn't been on stage during this time. Last year,
there was a Ray Cooney farce done at the Paper Mill Playhouse in
New Jersey, and he has worked for John Neville's theater company in
Nova Scotia as well as in all those tours of ``The Odd Couple.''
   ```The Odd Couple' is a masterpiece,'' he states
matter-of-factly. ``The laughs just roll in. But you have to play
it as if it's `Hamlet' _ very, very seriously.
   ``Any play that is good has some ideological basis behind it. In
`The Odd Couple,' it's male bonding. The play is very chauvinistic
and anti-feminist. The only women in it are two dingbats, and the
men hate their wives. The only happiness these men have is when
they are away from their wives.''
   Randall has worked in just about every medium except burlesque.
Last year when he was honored at the Museum of Broadcasting, four
videocassette machines simultaneously unspooled ``The Odd Couple,''
``The Tony Randall Show,'' ``Love, Sidney'' and ``Mr. Peepers,''
the four television series he has done.
   ``There was my life on the screen,'' he recalls. ``You could
watch me go bald.''
   Bits and pieces of Randall's story also are told in ``Which
Reminds Me,'' a collection of show business anecdotes he has
gathered during his more than 40 years as an actor. Randall, who
says he's ``cursed with almost total recall,'' wrote the book in
collaboration with and at the urging of a good friend, Michael
Mindlin, an advertising executive and movie publicity man. It
arrives in bookstores in November from Delacorte Press.
   Randall, fresh out of Tulsa, Olka., and one year at Northwestern
University, came to New York in the early 1940s. His first Broadway
show was Thorton Wilder's ``The Skin of Our Teeth'' in 1942. Well,
almost. He was drafted into the Army the second day of rehearsals.
   Four years later, Randall returned to New York, where he found a
lot of work on radio and a few small parts in the theater. But he
didn't _ and still doesn't _ think much of radio work.
   ``It was nothing,'' Randall recalls. ``Standing there reading a
script. What was that? And the script, for the most part, was
dreck. It probably had been written that morning. How could you
act? You had one rehearsal and you were on the air.''
   Randall had better luck _ and better parts _ on television,
beginning in 1952, when he appeared as English teacher Harvey
Weskitt in ``Mr. Peepers,'' one of the best of the early TV sitcoms.
   His big break on Broadway came in 1955 in ``Inherit the Wind,''
a retelling of the Scopes trial in which he played a reporter
modeled after H.L. Mencken.
   The play propelled him to Hollywood for scores of movies,
including three Doris Day-Rock Hudson classics, ``Pillow Talk,''
``Lover Come Back'' and ``Send Me No Flowers,'' as well as other
films like ``Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?'' and ``The Seven
Faces of Dr. Lao.''
   The 69-year-old Randall admits he was a little frightened about
returning to Broadway in a play as physically demanding as ``M.
Butterfly.''
   ``That's what I thought would kill me,'' he says. ``Moving
around like that and the knowledge that my predecessor (John
Rubinstein) had lost 25 pounds. And he was a young guy. They had to
get new costumes for him.
   ``But I was at the doctor's this morning with my wife and I've
gained weight.''
   Memorizing was an easy part of the job, Randall says. He had
four weeks of rehearsal before going on in ``M. Butterfly,'' and
director Dexter came back for a week to work with him.
   ``A replacement doesn't have that much option really,'' Randall
says. ``The first three weeks of rehearsal, he just works with the
stage manager who takes him through the established staging. If he
wants to change anything he can, but it's foolish. The stage is
lighted. Everything is set. If you want to move here instead of
there, that means they have to change the lights. It's not worth
it.''
   Actually, he adds, playing in ``The Odd Couple'' was more tiring
than ``M. Butterfly.'' ``But the role of Oscar is harder than
Felix. Oscar is a killer,'' he says of other half of ``The Odd
Couple.''
   ``I don't think I could play Oscar too well. Although when I
went into this play, a half dozen people asked me what part I'm
playing,'' Randall laughs. ``I don't see myself as the young
Chinese girl.
   ``I think it's `The Seven Faces of Dr. Lao.' They know I played
an Oriental in that movie.''

<HEAD>After 40 Years, Taiwan Is Rich and Democracy Makes Inroads</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ Forty years after Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek
and his Nationalist Chinese arrived in defeat from the mainland,
Taiwan is prosperous _ the world's 13th largest trading nation _
and democracy is beginning to take hold.
   But in 1949, with Mao Tse-tung' Communists in control of
mainland China, the outlook for the Chinese Nationalists on Taiwan
was bleak.
   Not only had they been routed from their homeland, they faced a
restive Taiwanese population that viewed Chiang and his 2 million
or so followers as an occupying force.
   The Nationalists prevailed, nevertheless, by dint of
authoritarian rule and clinging to their contention, supported by
the United States and other Western nations, that they were the
legitimate rulers of China.
   In the years since, firmly guided economic policies have
transformed Taiwan into the economic success it is now as the
island approaches its national day Oct. 10 _ Double Ten, for the
tenth day of the tenth month.
   With prosperity at its peak and people demanding greater
freedoms, the Nationalists have begun to loosen their authoritarian
grip, slowly bringing democracy to the island of 20 million and
permitting contacts with the rival Communist Chinese for the first
time since the civil war on the mainland.
   ``Many people used to be disappointed with the government and
tried to emigrate whenever they had the chance,'' said Lu Ya-li,
political science professor of National Taiwan University. ``They
now feel there is some hope and have begun to care and criticize.''
   An agrarian economy based on rice and sugar production has given
way to the manufacturing of textiles, electronic products and
machinery.
   The formula was capitalism mixed with government policies
designed to stimulate selected industries. While the Nationalists
controlled major monopolies, many of the light-industry factories
were family-run operations that helped spread the wealth around the
island.
   Annual per capita income rose from $50 in 1949 to $5,512 last
year. Gross national product soared from $1.2 billion 40 years ago
to $119 billion in 1988.
   Exports led the way, with foreign trade jumping from $300
million in 1952 to $110 billion last year. So much foreign exchange
has poured in that the island's coffers bulge with $74 billion in
reserves.
   Prosperity is everywhere on the streets of Taipei. Porsche and
BMW automobiles snake through the congested streets, fancy
restaurants are on almost every block and the latest electronic
gadgets fill store windows.
   Indeed, Taipei, the island's capital, seems to lack nothing.
   Except foreign embassies.
   While the island advanced on economic successes, it faced bitter
diplomatic defeats as the world recognized the Communist Chinese
government in Beijing.
   Only 24 countries, mostly tiny island nations and Latin American
countries, still recognize Taiwan diplomatically, down from 50 in
1949. The Communist Chinese government has formal ties with 135
countries.
   The toughest blow came in 1978, when Taiwan's major ally, the
United States, announced it was cutting diplomatic links and
setting up formal relations with Beijing.
   The United States dismantled its military bases on Taiwan and
said military aid would not increase in quantity or quality.
   But the U.S. market did not close to Taiwan and that helped
assure its economic health.
   Chiang Peng-chien, a leading opposition politician, blamed
Taiwan's diplomatic isolation on the ``dream of a reunified China''
ruled by a Nationalist government.
   The Nationalists also used that dream in their efforts to
justify their monopoly on political power and the harsh quelling of
dissent.
   The Nationalists placed Taiwan under martial law and refused to
allow rival political parties or an opposition press. Critics who
traveled overseas often were not allowed back; many of those who
stayed in Taiwan were thrown in jail.
   By claiming to be the rightful ruler of all China, the
Nationalists insisted that native Taiwanese, who comprise about 80
percent of the population, could not replace any of the members of
the Legislature and electoral college who had been elected in
mainland China before the civil war defeat.
   But as the Taiwanese prospered economically they demanded more
political rights. It was Chiang Kai-shek's son, the late President
Chiang Ching-kuo, who finally launched the political liberalization
the Nationalists needed if they were to maintain popular support.
   In 1987, Chiang Ching-kuo lifted martial law, which paved the
way for the formation of opposition political parties. Some media
restrictions were erased, leading to a more critical press. Taiwan
residents were allowed to visit relatives on the Chinese mainland,
bringing a more relaxed attitude toward the Communists.

   Demonstrations became an almost daily occurrence, with Taiwanese
taking to the streets to protest everything from prostitution to
pollution.
   By the following year, it became apparent that the gradual
liberalizing trend would not easily be reversed.
   When Chiang Ching-kuo died in January 1988, he was succeeded by
Vice President Lee Teng-hui, the first native Taiwanese to lead the
Nationalist government and a supporter of democratic reform.
   Six months later, Lee was named chairman of the Nationalist
Party and some, but not all, aging hardliners from the mainland
retired from top party posts.
   The Nationalist leadership under Lee has proposed a gradual
increase in the percentage of the Legislature that is elected on
Taiwan. Still, only less than half the seats will be contested in
Dec. 2 elections, making it impossible for the opposition to wrest
any real political power from the Nationalists.
   ``We are fully committed to democratization,'' government
spokesman Shaw Yu-ming said in a recent interview. ``We are moving
slowly but surely to meet the demands of the time.''
   But Taiwan still has problems:
   _Rising wages and an appreciating currency: These have made
Taiwan less competitive in low-cost exports and the government is
seeking a new economic formula to deal with the problem. ``We must
actively push forward the research of top-notch industrial
technologies,'' Premier Lee Huan recently told the Legislature.
``The service sector should also grow quicker to become the center
of our future economic development.''
   _Pollution caused by years of rapid development: Taipei's air is
foul and the island's rivers are filthy. Some villagers have
protested the construction of new factories they fear will ruin the
local environment.
   _Gambling and speculation: Gambling is illegal but rampant, and
speculating in the stock market has become the national pastime.
The Taiwan stock exchange is second only to Tokyo's in trading
volume, and some analysts believe it is a speculative bubble
waiting to burst. Some see the obsession as a temporary phenomenon
following the easing of foreign exchange controls in 1987. Others
argue that industrialists are more interested in quick profit than
in longterm investment, such as automating factories and developing
more sophisticated products.
   Perhaps the greatest challenge facing Taiwan is its policy
toward mainland China.
   Official policy remains the ``three no's'' _ no contact, no
negotiations, no compromise with the Communists. But that policy
today is a shambles.
   The government allows trade with the mainland if conducted
through a third party such as Hong Kong, and Taiwanese businessmen
have begun investing in the mainland to take advantage of low labor
costs.
   Finance Minister Shirley Kuo traveled to Beijing in May to
attend an Asian Development Bank meeting and met privately with
Communist officials.
   The future of such contacts is somewhat clouded because of the
Communists' violent suppression of the democracy movement this past
spring. But the old Nationalist dream of returning to rule the
mainland seems shattered.
   When the Chinese Communist government seemed in disarray during
the spring democracy movement, the Nationalists were forced to
acknowledge there was not much they could do but watch.
   ``We must have the courage to face the fact that at this moment
we are unable to effectively exercise the right to govern the
mainland,'' President Lee told a meeting of Nationalist leaders on
June 3.

   Antarctica, the last place on Earth where nature
reigns over man, is facing a showdown between those who want to tap
its fabled wealth and those who want it to remain forever untouched
under ice.
   The majestic continent at the bottom of the world, larger than
United States and Mexico combined, is still peopled by scant
thousands who have to import everything but ice cubes.
   Although 16 nations fly flags in Antarctica, and seven claim
slices of it, no one holds title. No one needs a passport. It is a
vast global common, ruled only by the harsh, unforgiving elements.
   But statesmen, scientists and environmentalists must decide soon
whether Antarctica will open up to oilmen and airmen, miners,
commercial fishermen, hotelkeepers and, possibly, colonists.
   In Paris, beginning Monday, 33 nations will review the 1959
Antarctic Treaty that expires in 1991. They also will examine the
remains of the Antarctic Minerals Convention, signed in May 1988.
   The convention would have allowed controlled mining and oil
exploration, replacing a voluntary moratorium. But Australia, one
of seven claimant nations with a veto, decided not to ratify it.
   The United States, the Soviet Union and Japan, among others, are
pressing for a minerals accord. France, echoing Australia's
concerns, wants Antarctica to be an unspoiled world park.
   Delegates were guarded over an eventual compromise. The 1988
convention took six years to negotiate.
   Proponents say a world short of resources has no choice.
Antarctica hoards unknown quantities of gold, platinum and other
strategic metals, along with oil in amounts estimated to be in the
billions of barrels.
   Detractors insist that even controlled exploitation inevitably
pollutes a reserve crucial to man's survival. Upsetting its
delicate balance, they say, will have consequences no one can
predict.
   Undeniably, the world is already muscling in. Penguin livers are
tainted with pesticides and plastics. Century-old garbage litters
pristine panoramas. Antarctica has had its first oil spill.
   ``Trash thrown into the North Sea will eventually settle in
Antarctica,'' the French oceanographer Jacques-Yves Cousteau once
told The Associated Press. ``The world is a closed system.''
   In a more recent interview, he railed against plans to exploit
the last untamed place on earth.
   ``That would be almost criminal, at least stupid,'' he said.
``It would be a catastrophe.''
   Scientists worry that tourists, whose numbers now approach
10,000 a year, endanger fragile ecosystems. Huge ice floes menace
ships' hulls, adding a threat of oil pollution.
   Yet it is the ancient lure of the mysterious continent, largely
unexplored for all of history's daring expeditions, that make it
such a disputed prize.
   Antarctica is 98 percent under ice, but it is no more a white
continent than Africa is a dark one.
   Old ice grows blue, then rich turquoise. As the sun shifts its
angle over floating ice and the glacier beyond, Antarctica is aglow
in pinks and oranges beyond the range of film or canvas.
   Penguin colonies, like rush-hour crowds dressed in black tie,
amuse scientists who try to take them seriously. Seals frolic and
birds move from place to place in turbulent clouds.
   For all the beauty, arguments focus on survival of the planet.
   President Francois Mitterrand of France, making the case for a
world wilderness area, told scientists from 40 countries at a June
meeting: ``It's not just the forests, the prairies or rivers that
are in danger. It's the entire Earth.''
   Specialists regard Antarctica as the world's weather factory.
   For 10 years, scientists there have measured the Earth's
thinning ozone layer, letting through radiation that risks
catastrophic changes in world climate and ocean levels.
   A New Zealand team recently reported the ozone hole over
Antarctica was much more serious than previously believed.
   Cousteau warns that jostling the precarious balance invites
calamity. For example, just scraping the surface of the Earth
spreads dust that alters reflectivity, raising temperatures and
melting ice.
   Human activity disturbs the breeding of unique species of birds
and marine mammals, scientists say. Fishing threatens a delicate
food chain that depends upon plentiful supplies of krill, a tiny
shrimp.
   In Antarctica, with treacherous sea lanes and lashing winds,
accidents are common. Once damage is done, experience shows, it is
very difficult to correct.

   Man on the frozen continent requires steady supply. The fauna is
all but inedible. Even penguin eggs are too greasy for breakfast.
The plants are minuscule lichens. And what comes in must be carried
out.
   Travelers today find Capt. Robert Falcon Scott's hut as he left
it in 1911, with unrusted tins of Huntley &amp; Palmer's biscuits lined
up on dust-free shelves. Cold, clean air preserves almost anything.
   Environmentalists rage at garbage dumps that accompany a
lengthening string of military and scientific outposts, including
the sprawling U.S. McMurdo Station.
   The Greenpeace environmentalist group set up a base near McMurdo
to monitor developments. Its members came to blows with French
soldiers building a runway across from a penguin rookery near the
South Magnetic Pole.
   The group accuses the Americans, among others, of killing marine
life with sewage and refuse. If scientists cannot protect the
environment, Greenpeace argues, oilmen and miners will be worse.
   Near the end of September, word filtered out that 44,000 gallons
of diesel fuel leaked from a pipe at the U.S. Amundsen-Scott
Station at the South Pole. The leak was discovered in August.
   U.S. officials said it would seep into the ice with no
environmental damage. But Foreign Minister Gareth Evans of
Australia called it a perfect example of why Antarctica had to be
protected.
   In the early 1970s, when politics heated in Antarctica, claimant
nations hurried to strengthen their positions.
   Argentina leased a Greek ship, with deck chairs but no radar,
for cut-rate tourism. Chile built a hotel. Last year, the first
commercial flights landed at the South Pole.
   Now Australian entrepreneurs propose ``Project Oasis'' _ a
runway for 747 jet aircraft, a five-story hotel and a hovercraft
dock.
   When the mineral convention was signed, some specialists argued
that controlled exploitation was better than no accord at all. If
anyone broke the moratorium, no international law would apply.
   Ideas included carrying out oil in submarines, rather than
tankers, to minimize risk.
   But the picture changed in January when an Argentine supply
ship, the Bahia Paraiso, nosed into waters marked on charts
``dangerous ledges and channels'' and tore open its double hull.
   The crew and all 81 tourists escaped, but an estimated 170,000
gallons of its 250,000 gallons of fuel oil leaked onto marine
habitats, eventually killing seals, penguins and other marine life.
   Salvage crews were able to stop the leakage but oil still
remains in the ship's tanks.
   The Argentine navy reported after a reconnaissance flight over
the area in early September that the Bahia Paraiso is still aground
in ice-free waters and listing at about 140 degrees.
   Capt. Raul Pueyrredon of the Argentine navy said the airmen
``saw no evidence of leakage nor any visible ecological damage.''
   He added that he was not sure how much oil remained in the
vessel but that ``it was very little.''
   In a letter to U.S. Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner in
May, the Environmental Defense Fund, an American organization that
describes itself as non-profit, said the Bahia Paraiso still had
about 70,000 gallons of fuel on board when the Southern Hemisphere
winter set in and still poses a threat to Antarctica's environment.
   ``Antarctica's worst environmental disaster has become a
forgotten oil spill,'' the letter said.

<HEAD>Differences Over Islam Are at Root of Afghanistan's Conflict</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Differences over what is and what is
not Islam lies at the heart of Afghanistan's 10-year war.
   President Najib has been attempting to deflate his foes' main
rallying cry _ that his Marxist-based People's Democratic Party of
Afghanistan is a pack of godless Soviet stooges _ by transplanting
the party's ideology into the country's Islamic heritage.
   But many Afghans hold deep suspicions that the party is rooted
in the Soviet Union next door. The assault on Islam by Najib's
predecessors has not been forgotten.
   Islam is the one link the violently competitive Afghan tribes
all share. Being recognized as a good Moslem is an ironclad form of
acceptance.
   Doubt in the leaders' faith is strongest among the Shiite Moslem
minority known as the Hazara. They make up about 17 percent of the
16 million Afghans, 99 percent of whom are Moslems. The Sunni sect
is the overwhelming majority.
   Hundreds of thousands of Hazara live in Kabul, but most inhabit
the mountains at the country's center, an area known as Hazarajat.
   The government has little control there, but the Hazara rejected
a government offer of formal autonomy earlier this year.
   ``The Hazara want to be part of the government, but not their
(People's Democratic Party) government,'' said one 52-year-old
professional interviewed at the Chendawul mosque. ``It is a
communist government.''
   The group was officially discriminated against for years, kept
out of the army and their rituals banned in public.
   The Hazara now have religious freedom, but they contend the
government ignores their development needs.
   ``If you go to Hazarajat, there are no houses, there are no
schools, there are no hospitals,'' said a mullah, or prayer leader,
at the Chendawul mosque.
   The Hazara spoke in interviews only on condition of anonymity,
saying that many who publicly denounced the government in the past
were sent to prison.
   They said the government's wooing them is in part motivated by
the desire to improve relations with neighboring Iran.
   The Islamic Republic of Iran, founded by the late Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, is run by Shiite Moslem clergymen and supports
the Shiite branches of the Moslem rebels, the mujahedeen, seeking
to overthrow the government in Kabul.
   The Hazara say they respect Khomeini as a religious figure but
do not look to his revolution to solve their problems.
   Many Hazara reject fellow Shiites who have joined the
government, such as Prime Minister Sultan Ali Kishtmand.
   ``The people in the party, it makes no difference from what
place, what religion they are, we still think they are communist,''
said the mullah.
   Najmuddin Kawyani, secretary of the party's Central Committeee,
says, ``Our party is not a communist party, our ideology is not a
communist one.''
   Government officials say development will come in time. They
point out that President Najib, who uses just one name, went to the
Chendawul mosque in August and pledged 10 million afghans, about
$180,000, for reconstruction.
   Suspicions about the religious faith of the government also are
held by other Afghan Moslems, including Maulavi Abdul Rauf at the
upscale Wazir Akbar Khan mosque, which is surrounded by a rose
garden in Kabul's diplomatic quarter.
   ``Our people are Moslem,'' he said. ``We don't know about the
government.'' The Sunni Maulavi, who is roughly the equivalent of a
bishop, spent five months in prison after he assailed Soviet
influence in Afghanistan at a sermon the president had attended.
   He also opposes the government's practice of writing sermons in
support of its policies for the 20,000 mullahs on its payroll.
   ``Religion should be free,'' Rauf said.
   The role of the government is ``to build more mosques, persuade
people to pray more, to establish the conditions so people will
want to pray,'' he said.
   The lack of trust in the party stems from alleged atrocities
that followed the April 1978 Marxist revolution.
   Independent studies put the number of Afghans killed in those
early days of the revolution at 50,000 to 100,000, with Hazara and
clergymen a particular target. Hazara claim 13,000 of their
tribesman disappeared from Kabul in one day.
   The government's land redistribution program was seen as an
attempt to rewrite Moslem inheritance laws and a heavy-handed
literacy campaign as an attack on the clergy as teachers. Even the
study of Islamic art was banned.
   These measures helped spark the rebellion against the government
and all have been reversed since the Soviet intervention in
December 1979, after which a more tolerant wing of the party was
given power.
   ``The culture of the people must be taken into considertion,''
said Abdul Ghafoor Bahir, minister of Islamic guidance. ``When the
revolution came there were some mistakes.''
   Islam was enshrined as the state religion in the constitution
adopted in 1987, which also stipulates that the president be a
Moslem. New laws cannot contradict Islamic law.
   Najib has won praise for establishing the University of Islamic
Studies and Research in Kabul. The Soviet withdrawel in February
gave a major boost to combating his un-Islamic image.
   The research center publishes books about Islamic history in
Afghanistan, such as a chronicle of the holy place in Kandahar.
   It is also a religious cheering section for the party, however.
Its walls are plastered with stickers of Koranic quotations used by
President Najib.
   ``He who destroys the house of one Moslem, he is in truth
destroying his own house,'' said one quotation. It is a pointed
reference to the destruction wrought by rockets of the mujahedeen,
whose name means holy warriors.
   Mohammad Siddiq Sailani, the university's president, Kabul said
that its aim is to educate students and that the religious
squabbling impedes progress.
   ``Some traditional customs that exist among the people are
un-Islamic,'' he said. ``We want to replace them with the real
Islam.''
   Among the customs he listed as un-Islamic was what he described
as the lack of equal treatment for women.
   ``A woman is not a toy,'' he said. ``Islam establishes many
rights for women and the rights should never be threatened by men.''
   The government viewpoint on this and other issues clashes
sharply with that of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, leader of the
fundamentalist Hezb-e-Islami faction of the Pakistani-based
mujahedeen.
   He has a reputation for having all the bars in Kabul bombed
because Islam forbids the consumption of alcohol. His group also is
believed responsible for killing two women bus drivers by blowing
up their buses when the government briefly experimented with women
drivers several years ago.
   The government also highlights what it calls the atrocities
committed in the name of Islam by the Saudi Arabian-financed
Wahhabi mercenaries fighting for the mujahedeen. Reports of their
mutilating victims and selling women into slavery are widespread.
   ``In our opinion, it is because of lack of knowledge of the
Koran that makes people act like this,'' said Gholam Sarwar Manzur,
president of the state-run Council of Clergy.
   Afghans in general say they basically want Islam respected by
the government.

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Look Who's Talking''</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Film opens nationwide Oct. 13.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Remember the ``Bachelor Mother'' kind of movie in which Ginger
Rogers seeks a husband so her baby will have a father?
   ``Look Who's Talking'' is a 1989 replay with all the old
gimmicks intact (``I don't like to fly,'' she insists. Next scene,
she's flying in his plane). The only innovation: the baby talks.
Not only that, the voice is that of Bruce Willis. The title, get it?
   It's a pleasant sitcom with amiable performances, especially by
the four infants who play Mikey. The scenes under the titles will
no doubt arouse controversy. A large round object floats amid
translucent, undulating folds of matter, bouncing gently at the
bottom of a pit. A flock of flittering, chattering polliwogs enters
the space, and one of them joyfully discovers the round object and
climbs inside. A new kind of sex education.
   Throughout the film, the voice of Willis makes comments,
enjoying his nine-month swim, complaining about his abrupt
emergence, conversing with other infants and generally observing
the human comedy. The one-liners wear thin, but some of it is funny
stuff.
   Mikey's mother is Kirstie Alley, a thirtysomething accountant
who has been impregnated by her client, a lecherous, charmless
fast-food entrepreneur (George Segal). When she goes into labor,
she hails a New York cab driven by John Travolta, who races her to
the hospital, then dons a mask and gown and witnesses the delivery.
   As you can guess, he falls for Kirstie and her baby, but she
considers him a loser. He becomes the sitter while she prowls for
prospective fathers, not realizing that Travolta is really a
struggling flight instructor. To illustrate his compassion, there
is a subplot about his concern for his senile grandfather (Abe
Vigoda).
   Amy Heckerling (``Fast Times at Ridgemont High'') directed her
own script, a loose affair that allows the actors to ad lib
aimlessly. The veracity of the film was not helped by filming it in
Canada. The producers saved money, but there's no way that
Vancouver can double for Manhattan.
   Kirstie Alley manages an endearing portrait of the beleaguered
mother; she's as appealing on the big screen as she is in
``Cheers.'' Travolta is so laid back that he seems invisible at
times, but it's good to see him back. Olympia Dukakis has some
bright moments as the worrying grandmother.
   ``Look Who's Talking'' is a Tri-Star release produced by
Jonathan D. Krane. The rating is PG-13, mostly for adult
situations. Running time: 103 minutes.

   ``Edge of Sanity'' (Virgin Vision. VHS-Beta, $89.95. Rated R)
   
   In ``Edge of Sanity'' Anthony Perkins remakes the classic Dr.
Jekyll and Mr. Hyde role into cheap buffoonery.
   As the good doctor Jekyll, he discovers the anesthetic powers of
a remarkable new drug, cocaine. His research elevates him in the
eyes of his peers. It advances the causes of medicine. It gives him
vigor and vitality. It's great.
   But it also leads to his downfall.
   In a laboratory mishap, Jekyll is exposed to spooky dry-ice-like
fumes, apparently from the cocaine, that _ presto _ change him into
a ghoulish monster. As Hyde, he is unable to resist his most base
desire, which, as it turns out, is slashing the throats of
prostitutes on the streets of London.
   Also as Hyde, he gets a ridiculous makeup job. His face is
slathered with a white film that looks suspiciously like Crisco.
His eyes are lined with auburn rings and his lips are painted with
cracking ruby-red grease.
   The pursuit of the murderer, Jack the Ripper-Hyde, has Scotland
Yard in a dither. Even though Hyde kills many of his victims in
plain view, has several witnesses and leaves behind mounds of
indicting evidence, the poor blokes can't seem to nab the killer.
   If you can get beyond those leaps of logic, you might find some
humor and entertainment value in the movie. If you take it
seriously and consider it a legitimate suspense thriller, you will
certainly be on ... the edge of sanity.

   ``Working Girl'' (CBS-Fox Home Video. VHS-Beta, $89.98. Rated R)
   
   With the possible exception of the gorgeous panoramic opening
view of New York from the Statue of Liberty, ``Working Girl'' is as
charming and fun to watch at home as it was in the theater. And the
charm is the problem.
   In the guise of a tale of one of the little people making it big
on Wall Street, ``Working Girl'' reinforces stereotypes: Most of
the secretaries are good-hearted but not real bright and not too
classy. The one woman at the top, Katharine Parker (Sigourney
Weaver), is perfectly tailored but a manipulative liar who tramples
other women and men to keep her place.
   Tess McGill (Melanie Griffith), the secretary who breaks out of
the typing pool, lies and cheats her way out, using as an excuse
that she had no part in making the rules she's breaking. And she's
also escaping her working-class boyfriend and crowd stuck out on
dumpy Staten Island.
   Assisting Tess in her meteoric rise is _ of course _ a modern
Prince Charming, a broker played by Harrison Ford. From the start
this is not just a business partnership, and even Tess' friend
(played wonderfully by Joan Cusack) can see the obvious and warns
Tess not to expect him to take her ``away from all this,'' though
the audience certainly expects that to happen.
   And the movie can be sloppy: If Tess is so determined to make it
on Wall Street that she takes class after class and can show up the
male traders, then how could she possibly have overlooked the
``dress for success'' advice?
   The acting is superior _ Griffith, Ford and Weaver all are a
treat to watch. Kevin Wade's screenplay is witty and Mike Nichols'
direction is lively _ almost covering up the lack of freshness
underneath.

   Anderson, Bruford, Wakeman, Howe (Arista)
   
   At least when Jon Anderson, Bill Bruford, Rick Wakeman and Steve
Howe were members of Yes, it took comparatively few strokes of the
computer keyboard to dismiss them. Now that they bill themselves as
Anderson, Bruford, Wakeman and Howe it's a bit more time-consuming.
   So let's be brief. Their record is as ponderous as the group's
name, all the worst tendencies of 1970s art rock brought back to
life in digital sound. Wakeman's pompous synthesizer playing and
Anderson's soprano are even more annoying than they were 15 years
ago. Such titles as ``Fist of Fire'' and ``Rock Gives Courage''
tell you not much is happening lyrically, either.
   Even worse, these men choose to noodle and drone for 60 minutes,
making this record a real endurance test.
   Don't encourage them. Just say no.

   Piano Quintet in A, the ``Trout,'' by Franz Schubert; Piano
Quartet in G minor, by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart; Artur Schnabel and
the Pro Arte Quartet (EMI).
   
   Artur Schnabel, giant of 20th century pianists and superlative
Beethoven interpreter, is reported to have said: ``I play Beethoven
to make my living; Schubert I play for love.'' His loving treatment
of the ``Trout'' can be heard on this EMI reissue of a 1935
recording, previously released on Arabesque.
   The interpretation may put off some listeners at first, but it
grows on you after a number of hearings. Schnabel's occasional
rhythmic flexing evokes an earlier romantic style, as do the string
players' tendency to slide between notes.
   The sound quality is not the greatest. The remastering from 78s
is uneven, and background noise considerable. But first violinst
Alphonse Ounnou's sweet tone and Schnabel's direct, lucid reading
of the notes shine through.
   The performance is brisk and muscular, but not so much that
Schubert's fleeting changes of color and mood are sacrificed. In
the first movement, phrases seem to build through their own natural
momentum. The cello and viola of the Pro Arte, a Belgian quartet
founded in 1912 and one of the most prominent before World War II,
sing beautifully in the Andante.
   The scherzo is the least successful of the movements, with a not
very appealing percussive, militaristic quality. The tempi in the
fourth movement variations never seem quite right, but that problem
is straightened out in the forceful finale.
   The wonderful Mozart G minor quartet was recorded a year
earlier. Schnabel and the Pro Arte members give a clean, square-cut
rendition. More than in the Schubert, the pianist's singing tone
and uncluttered phrasing come out.

   Piano Concerto in G minor, by Antonin Dvorak; Introduction &amp;
Allegro Appassionato, by Robert Schumann; Andras Schiff and the
Vienna Philharmonic, conducted by Christoph Von Dohnanyi (London).
   
   The G minor piano concerto was written in 1876, midway through
Dvorak's happy career. Behind the Bohemian master were five
symphonies, a good deal of chamber music and his first opera. He
had yet to write his last symphonic masterpieces, including ``From
the New Work,'' the opera ``Rusalka'' and his best concerto, the B
minor for cello. The 35-year-old composer was still 16 years away
from coming to New York as head of the National Conservatory, where
he was affectionately known as Old Borax.
   The G minor is a middling sort of work, a little long in the
first movement, sometimes amorphous and lacking truly memorable
moments. Yet the sunny melodies, Slavonic motifs and beautiful
orchestration are there.
   The orchestra is no mere accompaniment but collaborates with the
soloist in a joint symphonic effort. Dohnanyi and Schiff play it
that way. Pianist and orchestra players beautifully link their
passages, picking up and gently handing back themes. The Vienna
strings show an amazing sweetness in the highest reaches.
   The performance is live and shows few of the drawbacks of that
medium, with the usual advantages of freshness, immediacy and
excitement. Schiff and the orchestra are close to flawless
technically, and the audience is incredibly quiet. No tubercular
ward of coughers here.
   But the piano's recorded sound lacks richness and sounds almost
thin in the upper register.
   In the Schumann, not recorded live, Dohnanyi draws particularly
tasteful and melding phrases from the Vienna. Schiff plays well,
though the inspiration level seems to dip. Maybe that is due to a
comparison with the live Dvorak performance.

   Diego Rodriquez de Silva y Velazquez managed to
fill his canvases with spirit and dignity, whether his subject was
a nobleman or a twisted dwarf.
   His exquisite use of color and the fluidity of his paint made
him one of the most celebrated and honored artists of the 17th
century Spanish School.
   The Metropolitan Museum of Art is showing the stylistic
intellect of Velazquez at an exhibit through Jan. 7. The show
includes his ``An Old Woman Cooking Eggs'' (1618) with its haunting
reality and ``The Forge of Vulcan'' and ``Joseph's Coat,'' two
large works painted during a trip to Italy in 1629-31.
   Born in Seville, Velazquez was apprenticed to Franciso de
Herrera at age 11, and later to Franciso Pacheco. ``Christ and the
Pilgrims of Emmaus'' is among his early work and shows his
developing tendencies toward naturalism. He was made court painter
at the age of 25.
   In his later years, when he painted ``Coronation of the Virgin''

<TEXT>
   For a political activist such as Donald
Sutherland, the experience of playing the role of an Afrikaner who
becomes a fighter against South Africa's apartheid was something to
``kick-start'' his soul.
   The film is ``A Dry White Season,'' which so moved another
actor, Marlon Brando, that he ended a nine-year retirement to take
the brief role of a civil rights lawyer. The MGM release is also
notable as the first major film by Euzhan Palcy, a 32-year-old from
Martinique who directed her only other feature, ``Sugar Cane
Alley,'' on a $1 million budget.
   Sutherland and Palcy were here to help kick off ``A Dry White
Season,'' and in separate interviews both had high praise for
Brando.
   ``He's a genius,'' declared Sutherland. ``A genius as a
performer but also as a human being. He has this immense wealth of
observation, culture and literary reserves. You start to talk to
him, and you can see the ripples of the little stone you throw into
the water.
   ``As a fellow actor, he is blissful and so sharing. He makes you
feel so secure. I'm 54, and to work with this man that I used to
see in movie theaters and giggle at because he was so perfect, it
was incredibly intimidating. I had this crush on him; I just wanted
to be next to him.''
   ``He was wonderful,'' said Palcy, a stunning beauty with a dark
helmet of tiny braids. ``When Marlon came to the set the first day
of shooting _ dead silence. Nobody was talking. It was magical, the
myth was there. At the end of the first shot, he did something very
funny: He said, `And now I'm going to pee.' Everybody laughed,
realizing he was a human being.''
   Expectedly, Brando brought his own concepts to the role of the
defense lawyer: rumpled hair, a limp, a cane and an English accent
_ ``Marlon didn't want to portray an Afrikaner, so he wanted the
character to be an English South African barrister,'' the director
said.
   Palcy's involvement with ``A Dry White Season'' began in 1984,
when she read the Andre Brink novel about an Afrikaner school
teacher whose tolerance for apartheid turns to activism at the
sight of the regime's atrocities. Two years later she joined forces
with Hollywood producer Paula Weinstein, who had been seeking a
project about South Africa.
   The pair developed the script at Warner Bros., which decided not
to proceed. MGM's then boss, Alan Ladd Jr., agreed to sponsor the
project. A key element in getting ``A Dry White Season'' made was
the participation of Brando. The connection was made through the
actor's close friend, Jay Kanter, then Ladd's associate.
   When Brando approved the script, Palcy warned that the $9
million budget did not permit big salaries. He replied, ``I'll do
it for nothing.''
   Sutherland became involved in ``A Dry White Season'' through his
former agent, Hannah Weinstein, Paula's mother. Paula Weinstein
also served as his agent before moving on to production posts at
major studios. Sutherland signed on at one-third his usual salary.
   ``I thought it had the potential to be an entertaining film in
the best sense of entertainment,'' said the actor, who has never
visited South Africa. ``I didn't want it to be just a message
picture.
   ``I loved the idea of this film being about an Afrikaner, not
about a white Anglo liberal, but an Afrikaner whose forebears had
forged their way through on that great trek to set up their own
community. It was not unlike what we did in North America: We came
in and wiped out the local people, put them into reserves.''
   The locations for ``A Dry White Season'' were filmed in
Zimbabwe, and Sutherland rhapsodized about such experiences as
watching 79 elephants walking noiselessly in the moonlight.
   ``Of all of the places I've been, including China, Zimbabwe is
the only place where my wife and I want to go back on vacation,''
he said.
   Donald Sutherland has traveled far from Nova Scotia, where he
grew up plagued by shyness, ill health and gawkiness that prompted
playmates to call him Dumbo and Goofus. He withdrew into a world of
imagination, fashioning puppets and performing his own plays. He
claims a 40-year career.
   ``At 14 I was a radio announcer in Nova Scotia,'' he said.
``Then I went to the University of Toronto and got involved in
theater there. I studied at the Academy of Music and Dramatic Art
in London. I worked in the professional theater in England until I
got a walk-on part in a film called `The Dirty Dozen.'''
   He recalled sitting around a table with Lee Marvin, Charles
Bronson, John Cassavetes and other members of the cast. Clint
Walker complained to director Robert Aldrich that he didn't want to
impersonate a general because it wasn't fitting for his role as an
Indian.
   ``So Aldrich, who made decisions faster than you can imagine,
looked down the table, saw my shaved head but didn't know my name.
He said, `You with the big ears, you do it.' That changed
everything,'' Sutherland recalled.
   Sutherland became one of the screen's busiest actors, with such
achievements as ``M-A-S-H,'' ``Klute'' and ``Ordinary People,'' as
well as duds such as ``Start the Revolution Without Me,''
``Casanova'' and ``Die! Die! My Darling!'' Now his son, Kiefer, is
following his father's footsteps.
   ``He's terrific,'' said Donald. ``He has what I used to have
before I went to school and had it trained out of me: a kind of
purity.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Symphony Star Started Career Late, at Age Nine</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG MELLGREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Finnish conducter Esa-Pekka Salonen is a
star in the symphony orchestra world, and his only lament is that
his career in classical music started late _ at age 9.
   ``In this business people start at age 4 or 5,'' said the
31-year-old Salonen, named in August as musical director of the Los
Angeles Philharmonic.
   ``I realized young that this would have to be my life. I had no
other hobbies.''
   Salonen, in Oslo recently as a guest conducter, said he looks
forward to settling down with the Los Angeles orchestra after years
of nomadic conducting. He begins with the 1992-93 season.
   He succeeds Andre Previn in Los Angeles. `When I got the offer
from L.A., I did a hell of a lot of thinking ... finally, after
some time, I decided it made a lot of sense,'' Salonen said.
   ``With the L.A. Philharmonic I have an instrument that is
capable of anything. I have no other plans beyond it. It is
definitely one of the world's most important symphonies and the
possibilities are unlimited.''
   Between bites of an apple during an interview in a hotel lobby,
the boyishly handsome Salonen said, ``Frankly I'm fed up with
hotels and guest conducting.''
   He currently conducts the Swedish Radio Symphony and is
principal guest conducter of the London Philharmonia and the Oslo
Philharmonic.
   These and other engagements keep him on the road up to 44 weeks
a year. He speaks five languages, but countries often blur and,
``in the morning it doesn't matter what I say, its always in the
wrong language.''
   Salonen, in jeans and a blazer, said his weariness goes deeper
than jet lag.
   ``Guest conducting is almost doomed to be superficial unless you
know the orchestra very well. You work with one orchestra and then
a week later you go to another place,'' he said.
   ``What really excites me ... is getting beneath the skin of an
orchestra, which is not possible as a guest conducter. It takes a
long time to build up trust. You have to establish certain musical
habits in an orchestra to be able to express yourself.''
   So he will take a ``semi-sabbatical'' in 1991. ``I will lay down
in my hammock and remain there until I feel the urge to do
something.''
   But he will remain open about guest conducting in Oslo and
elsewhere and about renewing his Swedish contract, which overlaps
with his Los Angeles contract for the 1992-93 season.
   Salonen drew international attention in 1983 when he conducted,
with one week's notice, a London Philharmonia performance of Gustav
Mahler's Third Symphony.
   It was followed by a U.S. debut with the Los Angeles
Philharmonic and concerts in West Berlin, New York, Chicago,
Boston, Philidelphia, Paris, Montreal, Minneapolis and Washington.
   ``I always have so much work to do that I haven't really had
time to think about such concepts as success,'' he said.
   Salonen was raised in Helsinki. His classical music training
began at age 9. He studied composition and conducted at Sibelius
Academy. He eventually began to give concerts in Scandinavia.
   ``I happened to be part of a stimulating group and we had a
music society,'' he said of his childhood experience. ``I loved the
instant feedback. It was fun.'' He still joins young Finns who
compose and play their own music in a group called Avanti!
   A a composer, french horn player and pianist, Salonen began
conducting to make a living, and ``because I needed a conducter who
was sympathetic to my music, and that was me.
   ``Now I would rather see someone else conduct my music ... I get
very nervous about conducting my own music.''
   He is known as a champion of contempory music and avant-garde
experimentation. A philharmonic has a dual function, he said: as a
guardian of traditional music and as a forum for new ideas.
   ``Contemperary music allows you to understand old musical
phenomena in new ways,'' he said.
   A conductor's frustration is having to depend on others, he
said. ``You never make your own sound. You depend on the orchestra.
The chemistry ... is essential.
   ``It's hard to describe what I will do in Los Angeles. It must
be something organic, something that emerges by itself from the
collaboration between the orchestra and me.''
   Salonen got to know the orchestra as a regular guest since 1984.
His youth and small-country origins will be no problem, he said. In
Finland, talent finds encouragement.
   ``I never felt the age question as a problem in the States. The
society favors youth ... and age doesn't help if you can't
deliver,'' he said.
   Being a hot property presents other problems.
   ``You know three or four years in advance exactly where you will
be on any given date. It creates a claustrophobic feeling, like
your life is being taken away from you. You talk and think about
things that are five years in the future, but by that time you will
be five years older,'' he said.
   Salonen still has few hobbies. An avid reader and movie buff, he
occasionally listens to pop music so he can know what's going on,
and he cannot relax with classical music.
   ``If I listen to classical music when I'm relaxing I immediately
go to work, thinking about how I would do it,'' he said. ``I relax
to enthic music, Indian and Japanese, because I can just listen.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: Not the Average Rock Band</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Combine a mail deliverer, a dishwasher, a tour
guide and a certified driller of bowling balls and you have
``Katrina and the Waves,'' not the average rock 'n' roll band.
   Take the name, for instance. Former postal worker Kimberly Rew
is the acknowledged leader, the band's principal writer and
arranger. So who gets top billing? Singer and ex-dishwasher Katrina
Leskanich, of course.
   ``At first Kimberly was doing the singing and the group was
called `The Waves,''' explained drummer Alex Cooper, the band's
one-time tour guide. ``But once Katrina started singing, we became
`Katrina and the Waves.' Someone said we'd get more dates at the
military camps because the soldiers will come out for a girl's
name.''
   Military camps are important because both Cooper and Leskanich
grew up in military families that traveled all over the world.
Leskanich alone has lived in England, Germany, the Netherlands,
Nebraska, Massachusetts, California, Georgia and Kansas.
   The group's first live performances were at military bases,
before crowds that responded to a singer called Katrina.
   ``We used to play on these horrible naval bases up in Scotland
where these guys had in been submarines for six months and I was
the first female they'd seen,'' Leskanich said.
   ``They'd go absolutely wild, they were up to here in liquor.
They'd pull down their pants right on the dance floor. We just
collapsed laughing, it was all a joke. We're trying to do our
number and it was just ridiculous.''
   In 1981, Rew wrote ``Walking on Sunshine,'' a good old-fashioned
rock 'n' roll summer song _ bouncy melody, memorable guitar riffs
and Katrina's joyous vocals on top. It sounded like a sure hit, and
was: four years later.
   ``We took it around to all the stations and all the companies,
and nothing happened,'' Cooper said. ``Then we were signed at the
end of '84 to Capitol and at the end of '85 they put it out, pow! A
classic! It was released at the right time, just one of those
things.''
   After finally cracking the charts, Katrina and the Waves could
be expected to get right to work on a new album. They did, but the
record didn't come out until recently.
   ``We thought we had finished the record,'' Cooper said. ``But we
took it back home and listened to it, and said: `Oh dear. I think
we'll start again.' We did that twice.''
   The Waves consider their group a democracy; whoever shouts
loudest wins. Nothing is considered finished until everyone is
satisfied, and with four very distinct personalities, that can take
time.
   ``Alex is dad. I'd sit home all the time if I could. `C'mon,'
he'll say, `let's get on the bus,''' said bassist and bowling ball
surgeon Vince de la Cruz. ``Kim is the mad professor. Katrina is
chief brat. I just try to do as little as possible.''
   The band agrees that Katrina's voice and Kimberly's guitar and
songwriting are the key to their sound. But since Katrina won't
sing anything that doesn't feel right, ``creative differences'' can
emerge.
   ``Kim's songs are brilliant and he's still going to write songs
on his own that the band's not going to touch,'' Katrina said.
``But he's trying to write songs from my point of view and
sometimes I didn't agree.''
   She cited ``Crush on You,'' a ballad off the new album.
   ``At first, I thought it was a little too boy-meets-girl. That's
a good example of one of Kim's `boy-meets-girl' songs I tried to
change but when I did, it lost the innocence.
   ``I have to sing a song from my point of view. I feel it's going
to be believed. But when you are trying to write from someone
else's point of view, you start getting into cliches.''
   While all due admiration for Rew, the fellow Waves have started
contributing their own material.
   Katrina and Kim co-wrote ``To Have and to Hold'' and ``Love
Calculator.'' Kim and Alex share credits on ``Rock Myself to
Sleep,'' and the whole band contributed to ``Chain Lover,'' ``Rock
'n' Roll Girls'' and the hit single ``Break of Hearts.''
   ``We've only started doing that in the last six months,'' Cooper
said. ``Kimberly tended to always just come to us with songs, but
he suggested himself after about eight years that we should
contribute. It's taken us eight years to get confident enough to
work on our own ideas.''
   Sharing material has helped keep the band together; so has
separating their private lives.
   ``You live a very tense existence,'' Cooper said, ``but we all
have interests outside the band that are not musical and not
similar to each other's interests.
   ``Kimberly's happy to be working 24 hours a day, seven days a
week on music. It's a complete obsession. We love music, too, but
not with that kind of intensity.''

   Money matters to Terry McMillan. But the author
doesn't yearn for luxury hotels or billion-dollar deals, just
simple things _ a nice apartment or a good movie.
   The characters in her second novel, ``Disappearing Acts''
(Viking, $18.95), think a lot about money, too. Franklin works off
and on as a construction worker. Zora is a school teacher dreaming
of making it as a singer and songwriter.
   They're two warm, intelligent people living in Brooklyn who meet
by accident and fall in love. But if savings are low, luck matters,
and Franklin and Zora are nearly destroyed by events they're
incapable of controlling.
   ``She loves Franklin,'' McMillan said. ``That's the whole point
of the story. How much is enough? How much do you give before you
say, `I can't do this anymore'?
   ``It's like real life. Every relationship starts out great and
then reality sets in and there are things you have to deal with. A
lot of it boils down to how much of an investment you're willing to
make in order to make a marriage, or whatever, work.''
   The novel is a tapestry of exits and entrances, disappearances
and reappearances. Franklin's moods fluctuate like the Dow Jones
average, ranging from playfulness to self-pity and violence. Zora,
hiding a case of epilepsy she fears will drive her man away,
juggles career and family, finding release in music, friends and
the son conceived with Franklin.
   ``The title of the book came to me in a dream,'' McMillan said.
``I was in Brooklyn and I knew I wanted to tell the story about
what can happen between a man and a woman when they fall in love
and all these other things happen.
   ``I was in a similar situation where I couldn't believe I had
arrived at this point. I stopped seeing my friends, I stopped going
to certain places because he wasn't interested. I just disappeared.
I went to sleep and when I woke up that morning, I said,
`Disappearing Acts.'''
   McMillan lets Franklin and Zora tell their own stories, trading
chapters between the two. She began with the names, originally
wanting to call Franklin ``Langston,'' after author and poet
Langston Hughes, and Zora ``Mona.''
   But somehow, ``Franklin,'' with its soft first syllable running
into the hard ``k'' and gently trailing off again, fit the
powerful, sensitive man tortured by his inability to find steady
work.
   And the sophisticated but streetwise woman he alternately loves
and torments was renamed ``Zora'' in honor of the great writer Zora
Neale Hurston.
   The voices followed _ Franklin's earthy and angry, tender and
romantic. A self-educated black man trying to win Zora's trust
while battling a racist society and his own feelings of inadequacy.
His voice is mirrored in the following passage:
   ``I could see that she was a little scared at first. I mean,
sparks was flying so fast and everything, and I was just waiting
for her to tell me that her heart had been broke so many times she
didn't trust men no more. I was all set to tell her, `This time,
baby, don't be scared. This man ain't interested in breaking your
heart _ he's interested in gluing it back together and keeping it
for hisself.'''
   Zora's voice is hopeful and frightened. She's smart enough to
know what she wants but too dependent on Franklin to contend with
his bitterness and physical power:
   ``One of the things I've loved about Franklin from the start is
how safe he makes me feel. Protected. I'm not even talking about
his job situation. I'm talking about his heart. When he puts his
arms around me, if the wind was blowing a hundred miles an hour, I
wouldn't know it. ... One thing I'm sure of _ when God made him, he
should've been cloned. More women need to feel like this.''
   Zora was harder for McMillan to write than Franklin. ``I wanted
her to have some street smarts, but I didn't want her to be one of
these prissy Smith College types,'' the author said.
   ``There are a lot of educated black people who sound white. I
didn't want her to sound like that. There's a rhythm to her
sentences.''
   Much of McMillan's childhood can be traced by reading her first
novel, ``Mama.'' She grew up in a poor section of Point Haven,
Mich., but escaped to the sunshine and promise of California as a
teen-ager in the late 1960s. A love affair at 18 inspired her to
write poetry, and soon McMillan was writing vignettes.
   She attended the University of California at Berkeley, joining a
fiction workshop run by novelist and poet Ishmael Reed, who
encouraged McMillan to tap her writing talents.
   ``It was so easy, so gratifying,'' said McMillan, who now lives
in Tucson, Ariz. ``Not to say I actually wrote and finished real
stories, but the whole thing was emerging and it was just
wonderful.''
   Vignettes soon gave way to short stories and one short story
gave way to ``Mama,'' published in 1985. McMillan needed just two
weeks to write the book's first draft and another two weeks to
complete the second.
   ``My mother raised a houseful of kids, sort of alone, and I
think she did a good job of it,'' she said. ``I couldn't figure out
how she did it. It was more of an exploration, or a recounting, of
where she got her strength from.
   ```Mama' was autobiographical and so is `Disappearing Acts.'
When I say autobiographical, I mean being able to relate and
identify with things that I have witnessed, seen, observed or
experienced or a combination of all of them.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Urban Cowboy Johnny Lee Lost It All</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>

   Johnny Lee was an unknown honky-tonk
performer before his song ``Lookin' for Love'' from the movie
``Urban Cowboy'' climbed the charts.
   His stardom, though, was merely a blink in time. His career,
finances and personal life all plunged, and now he's trying to
regain some of what he lost.
   He has a 10-album contract with Curb Records. He's selling
another LP, ``Woods &amp; Water,'' through TV marketing. His biography,
``Lookin' for Love,'' has just been published by Diamond Books.
   ``The negative stuff is in the past,'' Lee said. ``Things are
positive now. I look forward to making good records, having a
family, being happy and healthy and being alive.''
   When ``Urban Cowboy,'' with John Travolta and Debra Winger, came
out in 1980, Lee's ``Lookin' for Love'' became a hit on both the
country music and pop charts. Another song, ``Cherokee Fiddle,''
was also on the movie's soundtrack LP, which sold 3 million copies.
   He and his country buddy, Mickey Gilley, came to represent
country chic in their snappy cowboy hats, spiffy Western shirts and
expensive cowboy boots. They appeared on TV shows such as ``Fantasy
Island,'' ``CHIPs,'' ``The Dukes of Hazzard'' and ``The Fall Guy.''
And Lee married actress Charlene Tilton, who portrayed Lucy Ewing
on TV's ``Dallas.''
   Today, he and Gilley are hardly friends. He went four years
without making a record. All the money he thought he made during
his peak years has vanished. He and Tilton divorced. They had a
child, Cherish Lee, 7.
   ``I lost everything except my talent,'' the 43-year-old singer
said. ``I never saw a dime.''
   Lee has since remarried, to Deb Lee in November 1986. That
marriage was a year after he released ``Keep Me Hanging On,'' his
last album until this fall's ``New Directions.''
   For reasons still unclear to Lee, no record company wanted him.
   ``I felt absolutely useless,'' he said. ``My dignity was taken
away. I just worked jobs at clubs here and there _ did whatever I
could do. It was quite devastating for a while.''
   Lee was a nightclub singer in the Houston area when he was
chosen to sing ``Lookin' for Love'' in the ``Urban Cowboy'' movie.
   ``Everybody related to it,'' he said. ``It's a meaningful,
simple song. To this day, everyone still knows the words to that
song.''
   He followed it with hit records such as ``One in a Million,''
``Pickin' Up Strangers,'' ``You Could've Heard a Heart Break'' and
``Yellow Rose,'' which also was the theme song for the former TV
series.
   But he had trouble getting money he felt was due him from his
career. An associate who was handling money Lee earned from
performing told him the money had been deposited in safe accounts,
but when Lee tried to get his money back he was unable to do so. He
hired lawyers to try to get the money, but legal fees mounted and
he finally could afford them no longer. He gave up.
   ``I was ready to get on with my life and start over. That's what
I had to do, start over,'' he said.
   He and Gilley went their separate ways under strained
circumstances, Lee said, because Gilley apparently felt Lee didn't
support him in his own legal battles.
   ``I still think the world of Mickey,'' Lee said. ``I love him
like a brother. But I've called him numerous times and he's never
returned my calls. I'm a little let down with him. It hurts me to
think so much of someone ... you can only do that for so long. If
they don't think the same about you, what are you going to do?
   ``I still think he's a great talent and a great guy and I miss
the relationship we had.''
   Lee estimates that he owns at least 100 cowboy hats.
   ``I just always have worn them,'' he said. ``All the clothes I
have go with them.''

   Richard Sherry began to ponder his own
mortality after his father died 20 years ago, and wondered how to
extend his own life.
   Two years later, Sherry found a way to help find an answer. He
enlisted as one of 1,000 volunteers in what has become the
longest-running comprehensive study of growing old, the Baltimore
Longitudinal Study on Aging.
   ``We owe it to ourselves,'' said Sherry, 57 _ a year older than
his father was when he died. ``I'm a great believer in what it is
trying to do.''
   Sherry comes every two years from Oklahoma City to the
Gerontology Research Center at Francis Scott Key Medical Center for
2{ days of tests.
   ``A great deal of energy has been spent by scientists who have
worked in this study for over a quarter of a century to prove that
aging is not a disease and does not necessarily end in a disease
process,'' said James Fozard, BLSA's scientific director since
1985. ``Many of the things that we used to blame on age ... are
indeed modifiable (by lifestyle) and probably add to the life
expectancy and add to the quality of life of people.''
   The BLSA, a component of the National Institute on Aging in the
National Institutes of Health, was founded in 1958 by Dr. Nathan W.
Shock, regarded as the founder of modern research on aging. He
started the first NIH section on gerontology in 1941 at Baltimore
City Hospital.
   ``Dr. Shock wanted to measure such things as the rate of
aging,'' said Fozard. ``As it turns out, this hope sort of
disintegrated and was replaced by a number of more specific
questions.''
   BLSA researchers have studied aging's effects on more than 1,800
people, who are given physical examinations. Tests are done each
visit on all of the organ systems, the condition of the blood,
muscles, bones, hearing and vision. Electrocardiograms and tests
using radiation are given less frequently.
   Volunteers also are tested on their memory, reasoning and
problem-solving abilities, intelligence and personality, a history
of each person's aging that is used in more than 50 studies under
way as part of the overall project.
   Among the findings is that ``there is no single biological
master clock which drives all of the physiological aging that we
see,'' Fozard said.
   Volunteers pay their own way to Baltimore and spend more than
two days every 2{ years undergoing as many as 103 medical and
behavioral tests. ``I know of no other study that makes that kind
of demand,'' he said. ``We ask them for a lifetime'' of commitment,
and many agree to be autopsied after they die.
   The study pays for lodging and meals while volunteers are here,
as well as for the tests, which could total $4,000 at a doctor's
office or hospital.
   The volunteers range in age from 20 to 97. Sixty-five percent
are men, 70 percent are college educated, and half of those have
advanced degrees. Most are middle- or upper-middle-class and only 5
percent are black.
   ``In some of the studies the social class definitely makes a
difference,'' Fozard said. ``In that sense, the study may not be as
representative'' as one with a more varied sample. But ``when you
compare all types of biological results, these things don't vary
much on social class.''
   Scientists who use data from the BLSA say the racial and social
structure of the study is one of its weaknesses.
   ``In an ideal world, we'd have it truly representative of all
groups in the United States,'' said Dr. Hugh Taylor at the Wilmer
Eye Institute at Johns Hopkins Hospital. ``But you have to be
realistic. There is a variety of people there and everybody is
going to die. Everybody gets old.''
   Researchers say the study's history explains its sociological
profile.
   The first subject, Dr. William Wesley Peter, recruited
participants from among family and friends, a practice that
continues among volunteers today.
   The study has a waiting list of about 1,000 people, and
researchers have not made an effort to broaden its base, Fozard
said.
   Paul Kirby's grandfather volunteered shortly after the study
began. Since then, Kirby, 40, of Glenwood, Md., his father, brother
and three sisters became involved. His wife, Pamela, and a sister's
husband also have volunteered.
   The involvement of nine members of a single family could help
the BLSA determine whether heredity determines aging, Kirby said.
``If they can see a trend in different generations of a family,
they might find a genetic link.''
   That genetic link still has scientists baffled, Fozard said.
``We are constantly looking for ways to measure to get a handle on
the genetic component of aging. We think there are only a few genes
involved with aging, but where they are and what they are is still
a mystery.''
   Kenneth J. Nicholson, 86, of Mesa, Ariz., joined the study in
1960. He recently completed his 13th checkup for the study, which
he said has ``made me more cognizant of aging and the aging
population.''
   Nicholson said he also has modified his diet and made other
changes in his lifestyle as a result of information gleaned during
his visit.
   Information on any medical problem detected is given to the
volunteers, and their family physicians are notified so treatment
can be prescribed.
   ``The longer I have cooperated, the more they are providing
information to us,'' Nicholson said. ``They give me good advice and
that is very helpful.''
   Fifteen scientists work with the BLSA full-time, Fozard said. As
many as 10 other scientists collaborate periodically through
agreements with universities around the country. The study has an
annual budget of about $3 million.
   Volunteers say the BLSA's impact on society is enormous.
   ``The longer it can run, the more value they will get out of
it,'' said Nicholson. ``I would certainly hate to see it stopped.''

<HEAD>New Rules Ease Threat of Poverty When Spouse Enters Nursing Home</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Husbands and wives struggling with the
staggering costs of nursing home care for a spouse have new
protections against the threat of poverty under rules that kick in
this month as part of the Medicare catastrohic health insurance
program.
   The ``spousal impoverishment'' rules have broad support on
Capitol Hill and appear safe from repeal as Congress debates
whether to scrap major provisions of the catastrophic-care package
to appease senior citizens angry at the costs of the coverage.
   The new nursing home protections most typically will benefit
older women who might otherwise be left destitute when their
husbands are institutionalized at costs averaging more than $25,000
a year, advocates say.
   In the past, Medicaid would help pay nursing home bills only
after couples spent most assets and income of the institutionalized
spouse, often leaving the at-home spouse little to live on.
   ``It was really a very tragic situation,'' said Laura Loeb of
the Older Women's League. ``With women living on average about
eight years longer than men, these older women were forced to live
out their remaining years in poverty.''
   Attorney Patricia Nemore of the National Senior Citizens Law
Center said that if most of a couple's assets and income were
listed in the name of the spouse who went into the nursing home,
``you could lose pretty much everything.''
   Some couples were driven to divorce to establish court-ordered
property and income rights for the non-institutionalized spouse.
   A 1987 congressional study found that the high costs of
nursing-home care were quickly exhausting many couples' resources,
leaving more than half of all couples impoverished within six
months after one spouse entered a nursing home. About 15 percent of
the nation's 1.5 million nursing home residents are married.
   ``Most often it is the wife who remains in the community, and
she often is left with little or no money with which to meet her
own health care and other needs,'' the Senate Special Committee on
Aging reported last year.
   Under rules that took effect Sept. 30 and being implemented by
states this month, the spouse in the community will be able to keep
more of the couple's combined assets and income.
   Where couples in the past could qualify for Medicaid help only
after spending all but about $2,000-$3,000 in assets other than
their homes and certain personal belongings, now they will be able
to keep $12,000-$60,000, depending on the level set by their state.
   The minimum monthly income allowed in the past was set at the
Supplemental Security Income level, $368 in 1989, but now rises to
122 percent of poverty, or $815, and will increase to 133 percent
in July 1991 and 150 percent in July 1992. States will be allowed
to let couples keep up to $1,500 a month in 1989, with the maximum
rising in future years.
   Income and asset limits could be even higher if ordered by the
courts.
   Ronald Pollack, executive director of Families USA, an advocacy
group for the elderly, said that while the new protection doesn't
solve the problem of rising costs for long-term care, ``it
certainly provides tremendous relief.''
   ``For somebody who has lived relatively well, the amount they
can keep still may be seen as a hardship, but for those of moderate
to middle income, it is going to substantially improve the
protection that they had before,'' Pollack said.
   The Health Care Financing Administration has estimated that in
fiscal 1990 the new protections will cost the federal government
$165 million and state governments $135 million. The federal share
will rise to $245 million in 1991 and the state share to $200
million.
   John Rother, legislative director for the American Association
of Retired Persons, said the costs are ``a drop in the bucket'' yet
produce a benefit that is ``a real lifesaver'' for many older
Americans.
   ``It doesn't do anything for the person without a spouse, but it
does protect many of the people who've sacrificed the most,''
husbands and wives who already have spent years taking care of a
spouse at home, Rother said.
   The new impoverishment rules were enacted as part of a program
to insure the elderly against the costs of catastrophic illness,
but even before all the program's benefits have taken effect, many
senior citizens are demanding its repeal because they say it is too
costly.
   Congress is expected to scrap much of the program or cut it
back, but even legislators leading the call for repeal favor
preserving the new impoverishment rules as a worthwhile and
inexpensive protection.
   Advocates for the elderly, meanwhile, say that even if the whole
catastrophic program survives, the nation still needs a solution to
the high costs of long-term care, largely overlooked in the package.
   ``Spousal impoverishment is a result of the fact that our health
care system doesn't cover these costs,'' said Ms. Loeb. ``We still
need some sort of public program that provides protection for the
really catastrophic costs of nursing and home health care.''

   Maggie Wiel is 80, nearly blind and
can't live on her own. Yet she bristles at talk of a nursing home.
   But Wiel lives at Tam House, a communal home on a tree-lined
street in the shadow of Mount Tamalpais, with seven other women and
two men. Its directors call Tam House an idea whose time has come;
residents are simply thankful it exists.
   ``It's perfect for someone like me. I needed to be around people
but I needed to be independent and on my own,'' said Dorothy
Wright, 70, who moved in 18 months ago after separating from her
husband of 46 years.
   Now Wright spends her time gardening, playing bingo, visiting
nearby senior centers and hiking six miles a day. ``It's great to
be able to walk to a good trout fishing lake from your home,'' she
said.
   Charlotte Mulford, 79, came to Tam House after staying with a
cousin on his houseboat in Sausalito. Now she wouldn't feel
comfortable going back. ``If I didn't live here, I couldn't afford
to live anywhere else,'' she said.
   The 7-year-old, private, non-profit home owned and operated by
the Ross Valley Ecumenical Housing Association, offers more
independence than a board-and-care home, while fostering
companionship and support. Although there is a waiting list, there
hasn't always been. Communal living isn't for everyone.
   It took more than a year to fill the six-bedroom main house and
four-bedroom annex, said Norma Dougherty, RVEHA executive director.
``It was a new idea. Shared living was not a real popular idea with
seniors.''
   Many wanted their own apartment and were reluctant to squeeze a
lifetime's belongings into a bedroom, Dougherty said. And for many,
Tam House also is the first time they've lived with a group since
they were youngsters.
   Tam House is the product of a group of local church members who
started meeting in 1975 to discuss senior housing. In 1980, they
found the house, which was bought and renovated with federal
development funds.
   Residents must be at least 55 and able to live independently
when they move in. Rents range from $400 to $425 a month, including
dinner and food for do-it-yourself breakfasts. Operating costs were
$78,780 in 1988, Dougherty said.
   Advocates for the elderly expect shared group housing to become
increasingly common among seniors. ``It's very common among young
people, it's just not been an acceptable mode of living among old
people until recently,'' said Ellen Caulfield, director of the
Marin County Agency on Aging. ``I think it is an extraordinarily
viable concept but it takes the right mix of people.''
   This year, for the first time, California expanded its senior
housing program to include funds for such shared group residences.
For those who don't mind paring down, group housing offers a
balance of privacy and company.
   Mulford's tidy room disguises the fact that she has boxes and
crates under the bed, jammed in the closet and covered with afghans
in the corner. Little things can rankle, she admitted, laughing at
her own annoyance when others forget to refill the ice cube tray or
replace a roll of toilet paper.
   But the good outweighs the bad, she said. Tam House is within
walking distance of shopping, restaurants, entertainment and public
transit.
   Although residents must be independent, Tam House is small
enough to accommodate changes. Wiel's glaucoma has reduced her
vision since she moved in so ``that they wouldn't take me this way
now.'' But residents help her with chores, and all agree she is
coping remarkably well with her handicap.
   Otto Springer, 81, is a senior member of the house, having moved
in in 1983. Boxes of files create a maze-like pattern on his floor,
and books and more files practically spill off the bookshelves. A
portable computer hums in the corner. Springer is writing his
memoirs.
   He is a survivor of German concentration camps and was a spy for
the British Secret Service who worked to rescue Jews during World
War II. He was imprisoned for refusing to divorce his Jewish wife,
who escaped. Family photos hang on the wall beside framed
commendations from Israel and California.
   Although his two daughters have each offered to share their
homes, Springer will never accept. ``I would have the feeling that
I am burdening someone. We have a wonderful relationship but I
wouldn't want to encroach on their privacy. Even if you have a big
house, it's a problem to have old people around.''
   Although only one person, who had a drinking problem, has been
evicted, Tam House residents are sensitive to the ruptures that
conflicts can cause.
   Springer said he is sometimes bothered by noise but uses
earplugs rather than complain because ``it would establish a
certain tension.''
   ``This is 10 crotchety old people,'' said Teddy McDonald, 81.
``We're all set in our ways before we get here. It's simply amazing
how we all get along.''

   Chip Hutton has retired from a 27-year Navy
career that included the command of two ships, but he's still
giving plenty of orders.
   ``You can't do anything now but sit in your seat.''
   ``I want everything off the desk.''
   ``Listen to me. If you're not listening, you're not going to do
well.''
   The orders are directed at fourth- and fifth-graders at
Larchmont Elementary School. Hutton, 50, became their teacher this
year after completing an Old Dominion University program that
offers a master's degree and teaching certification to retiring
military personnel.
   ``I believe that I can help these kids,'' the former Navy
commander said of his 16 students, all of whom have failed a grade
and have difficulty learning.
   Between commanding a destroyer and a salvage ship, Hutton spent
much of his career teaching ROTC courses. Fed up with
administrative work, he chose his new career because it lets him
work with a small number of students all day long.
   Hutton is one of the first graduates of the Old Dominion
program, which has attracted 162 military personnel nearing
retirement. All but four are men.
   Robert H. MacDonald, professor of educational curriculum and
instruction at Old Dominion, has no trouble recruiting students or
finding schools for them.
   ``The school divisions are calling and asking for these guys,''
said McDonald. Their military backgrounds make them good planners,
counselors and negotiators, and ``all those are teacher skills.
They also bring to education just extensive life experiences.''
   MacDonald has found the retired officers are no more
authoritarian than anyone else. They are unfamiliar with young
children, though, so the program sends them into the schools to
talk with students and teachers before they decide whether teaching
is right for them.
   A half-dozen have done their student teaching at Indian River
Junior High School in Chesapeake, where Assistant Principal Kathy
DuLaney said, ``They're wonderful. They come in with a lot of
experiences that we can use. They're used to dealing with the
public. They've got lots of managerial skills.''
   One Indian River mother wanted to know if her son could have a
retired military officer for his teacher again this year because
the one her son had last year was the only teacher who ever made
him work, Ms. DuLaney said.
   The military retirees also provide good role models for teen-age
boys, she said. ``For so many of our kids the father figure is
absent.''
   Similar programs are offered in Florida, California and North
Carolina, which have large military populations, but Old Dominion's
is the largest, said MacDonald. Many of the retired officers are
interested in teaching math or science, both areas where teacher
shortages have developed.
   Hutton went into his new job with realistic expectations, so
he's had few surprises. He has learned that teaching rambunctious
children takes a lot more patience than giving orders to sailors on
a ship. ``It takes an awful lot of patience and you have to grab
every success that you have and remember it because the successes
are few and long in coming.''

   David Karp is only 45 but he's convinced his worst
years are just around the corner. Karp isn't afraid of old age, he
just fears the 50s.
   The Boston College sociologist believes too much attention is
paid to the trauma of turning 30, the midlife crises of the 40s and
the infirmities of old age. The 50s may be the most neglected
decade _ and the most frightening. The 50s, he says, is when one's
mortality first comes sharply into focus.
   ``The basic idea of the science of aging is how other people
define us,'' said Karp, who studied 72 people between 50 and 60.
``You're as young or old as other people make you feel.
   ``I think that during the 50s, those messages pick up steam.
During this period, people begin to think in terms of how long they
have to live.''
   Writing in a recent issue of The Gerontologist, in a piece
titled ``A Decade of Reminders,'' Karp outlines the ominous signs
of aging that appear for the first time in the 50s.
   He begins with the ``body reminders.''
   ``In the 50s, people's bodies begin to betray them. Some develop
life-threatening disabilities. For others, it's as simple as
playing ball with your kid and noticing you can't throw the ball
that far anymore.''
   Then come the ``generational reminders.''
   Those in their 50s are ``sandwiched'' between generations in a
way that makes them face their own growing limitations, Karp said.
Their elderly parents may be aging rapidly or about to die, and
their children may be growing more independent, often making them
grandparents.
   Finally, there are ``contextual'' reminders, like the perennial
Wunderkind who suddenly realizes his days as a whiz kid are long
over.
   ``People find themselves the oldest in many settings. People
want you to be their mentor. People start to read the obituary
pages. Collectively, they give rise to a changing conception of
time _ they recognize the finiteness of time.
   ``The sharpness of the recognition that you're aging, the
discrepancy between mental and physical selves, becomes harder and
harder to maintain.''
   Men and women may cope with these psychological crises
differently.
   By their early 50s, men, especially professionals, have usually
reached the peak of the their careers, Karp said. It's often
depressing to them to realize they may never go higher.
   But many women who sublimated career ambitions to home and
family may have just joined the work force in their 40s. They feel
they still have a lot to do.
   ``Whereas men in their 50s are beginning to develop an exit
consciousness, women can't even thing about it,'' Karp said.
   But all is not just ``doom and gloom,'' he said. Though the
signs of aging are there, ``nothing is said. Married couples in
their 50s, their children often already launched, may live together
for another 15 years.
   ``People are working longer. At the same time, many of the
people talk about a growing wisdom. They see things more
holistically. They look forward to life. They sometimes see the
empty nest as a liberating time.''

<HEAD>Patriarch of Journalism Still Going Strong at 93</HEAD>

   Journalism careers begin humbly under
Wesley Maurer, a 93-year-old patriarch of the profession who starts
the process by having bright young students restock newspaper
vending machines.
   Maurer teaches an old school of journalism, the small-town kind
known unkindly in big-city newsrooms as ``chicken dinner news.''
It's the toughest journalism there is, and the most important, he
believes.
   Maurer bought the Mackinac Island Town Crier for his students
and the St. Ignace News for himself. At both weeklies, reporters
and interns write about ice cream socials and summer parades. They
sell ads, take subscriptions, paste up the paper and collect
quarters from the stands.
   They also probe social issues and pry truth from rumor. And they
listen for the beat of the community heart.
   ``The idea to know about journalism is to know the whole
thing,'' Maurer says. That means living with the people you write
about and to whom you sell the stories and the ads. Shed your
cynicism and tell readers of their own decency, grace and
commonweal, Maurer says.
   You might not expect to learn such high ideals selling ads for
an obstinate man who can hardly hear, who sits dwarfed in his dim
office beneath a wall of books, ripping into newspaper stories.
Here is a man who advocates such old-school and now taboo ideas as
doctoring quotes to improve their clarity.
   Some of Maurer's students start their summers on Mackinac Island
thinking they're entering a museum. The necessity for reporters to
cover their beats by riding bicycles on the motorless island
doesn't help.
   ``I think they look at him, in a way, just as an old man. I hate
to see it but I know where it's coming from,'' said one of Maurer's
disciples, Richard Hayden, a publisher who came out of retirement
to be advertising manager.
   ``I know they respect him but they wonder with his age that he
might be out of touch with reality. ... They look at him as a
stodgy old professor.
   ``Then, all of a sudden, it's a rude awakening. Here's this man
tearing into their copy and they're not prima donnas anymore.''
   There is more to Wesley Maurer than this.
   He works every day of every week and always wears a suit with a
University of Michigan pin _ he joined the faculty in 1928 and was
journalism chairman for two decades starting in 1947 _ and a tie
with a perfect Windsor knot, even when weeding his beloved roses.
Sunday mornings, he gathers his interns for three-hour lectures on
topics ranging from the Cold War to why papers didn't sell.
   ``He called me back into his office once and I thought there was
something wrong with one of my stories,'' said former St. Ignace
reporter Mark Esper, now at the Ironwood Daily Globe. ``Instead, he
leans back in his chair and says `Light can illuminate but it can
also blind.'''
   Vintage Maurer.
   The reporters he has coached, encouraged and tormented have gone
on to become correspondents, editors and publishers around the
world.
   ``He is a terrific teacher, a very stimulating fellow. He makes
you think,'' said Earl Gottschalk, one of Maurer's first island
interns, now senior writer for the Los Angeles bureau of the Wall
Street Journal.
   Maurer's students tell of a relentless teacher and
perfectionist. The idiosyncrasies are tolerated. The ideologies are
cherished.
   ``I feel every moment I can spend with him is worthwhile. He is
forever the teacher,'' says senior intern Sean Reavie. ``I know new
students see this 90-year-old man waddling around and they say,
`What can he do for us?' But they genuinely love the man at the end
of the summer.''
   And how Maurer loves them. ``I get always connected with young
people. It's a delight. I find them interesting.''
   Age now is wedging itself between Maurer and the business he
loves. Bypass surgery last fall knocked him off his feet. ``Despite
doctors' orders, he would come down here and be on his feet to
check the paper,'' Hayden said. ``He was just obstinate. I know he
had said to me at one time when he was recovering, that he thought
it could be the beginning of the end.
   ``I had never seen that attitude in him.''
   Maurer has, however, turned over more of the daily newspaper
work to his son, Wesley Maurer Jr., and to Hayden. Neither man has
a journalism degree, but both are lifelong students of Maurer's
community news.
   ``I'm an old man who doesn't know when to retire,'' Maurer says.
``As long as I can, I will do some kind of work, because I think
that keeps you alive.''

<HEAD>Xeriscape _ Native, Low-Water Gardening Sweeping the West</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE>
<TEXT>
   James Walters worked for the AP as a reporter
and editor from 1947 until he retired in 1984.

<BYLINE>By JAMES E. WALTERS</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A revolution called Xeriscape is sweeping home
and public landscapes of the West. Manicured lawns and carefully
tended plants seem out of place. Native plants requiring minimal
care and water are popular.
   Water shortages are the primary catalyst, of course. But the big
push comes when folks realize many native plants are things of
beauty that can be grown with minimal effort and expense.
   In Denver, for example, a water department brochure suggests a
number of outstanding plants that grow well with little or no water
beyond what nature provides, and reports savings of from 30 percent
to 60 percent.
   ``Lots of greenery does not have to mean lots of water,'' says a
brochure published by the Arizona Municipal Water Association; the
state Department of Water Resources; the Salt River Project, which
manages reservoirs; and the cities of Phoenix, Glendale, Mesa,
Scottsdale and Tempe.
   ``Xeriscape News'' is the official publication of the National
Xeriscape Council Inc., 940 E. 51st St., Austin, Texas, 78751. A
recent edition featured the opening of a xeriscape garden in a San
Diego park, though most material is aimed at the average homeowner.
The more than 50 Xeriscape projects nationwide include a
demonstration garden in Wichita, Kan.
   The national council has trademarked the term Xeriscape to
prevent its use as a product or corporate name for private gain.
The Xeriscape concept, which means water conservation through
creative landscaping, is generally credited to a 1981 idea of the
Denver Water Department. The idea, of course, has been around for
years, especially in the arid Southwest.
   One of the earliest advocates was Warren Jones, then a professor
of landscape architecture at the University of Arizona. He won
hoots of derision when he first suggested limiting lawns to
10-by-10 feet. Jones, now retired, is a director of the national
council, and removing most of the lawn is generally the first
recommendation to homeowners switching from conventional
landscaping.
   The second recommendation is to use plants adapted to one's
area, grouping them according to moisture, light, climate and other
needs.
   ``Be sure to learn the needs of any plant and have a use for it
in your landscape before purchase,'' advises the Front Range
Xeriscape Task Force of Colorado.
   The concept involves using numerous attractive trees, shrubs,
flowers and ground covers, plus mulches. Pruning, weeding,
fertilizing, pest control and similar maintenance often isn't
required because of plant adaptability.
   While low water use is a must, there is some dispute over
whether this is a sufficient criteria. ``Few things are more
beautiful than our desert's natural low-care, low-water-using
plants,'' says Robert Breunig, director of Phoenix's Desert
Botanical Garden.
   Karen Reichardt, president of the Arizona Native Plant Society,
says ``our native mesquites, desert willows, palo verdes and
acacias help to distinguish'' the state. ``Olives, eucalyptus and
Italian cypress are examples of things that will thrive in Perth,
Australia, or Kabul, Iran, as well as here. If we focus only on
water-saving plants, we open the doors to their widespread use.''
   Greg McPherson, a University of Arizona assistant professor of
landscape architecture, recently studied the landscaping value of
the native palo verde and the non-native mulberry, a popular shade
tree in Arizona.
   Starting with 5-year-old trees, he found it cost $25 a year more
to irrigate the mulberry although it provided about equivalent
savings in air conditioning. Most native trees also grow much
quicker than non-native ones. The desert willow, for example, can
grow three feet a year in the the summer before reaching its
eventual height of around 25 feet. And it's always included in
lists of highly desirable local trees.

<HEAD>Never Too Late to Try Cancer Prevention Measures</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE>

director of the National Institute on Aging, one of the 13
institutes that comprise the National Institutes of Health of the
Department of Health and Human Services.

<TEXT>
   More than half of all cancers occur in
people 65 and older, but many people mistakenly assume that once
they reach retirement age they are powerless to prevent the disease
_ that it's just too late to try.
   Age is one of the greatest risk factors for developing cancer.
At 25, the chance of being diagnosed with cancer within five years
is one in 700; at 65 it is one in 14. However, scientists are
convinced we can improve those odds.
   It's never too late to prevent cancer. Here's how.
   Stop smoking. Cigarette smoking causes 85 percent of lung
cancers in men and 75 percent in women. Smokers also are more
likely to develop cancers of the mouth, throat, esophagus, pancreas
and bladder. Once you quit _ no matter what your age _ your risk of
cancer begins to decline right away.
   Eat a variety of good foods. Researchers have found that a
high-fat diet increases the risk of breast, colon and prostate
cancers, which are common in older people; a well-balanced diet
reduces the risk. In particular, eat more high-fiber foods
(whole-grain cereals, fruits and vegetables) and fewer fatty foods
(butter, cream and high-fat cheese). It's not as hard as it sounds.
You don't have to give up all of the foods you like; eat more of
the foods that reduce your risk of cancer and less of those that
increase it.
   Drink alcohol only in moderation. Cancers of the mouth, throat,
esophagus and liver occur more often among heavy drinkers of
alcohol.
   Avoid too much sun. Almost all skin cancers are caused by
exposure to the sun. Repeated exposure is especially dangerous for
people with fair skin and those who freckle easily. The sun is
strongest from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Sunscreen lotions and protective
clothing, like a hat or long-sleeved shirt, can help.
   Use hormones carefully. Estrogen has been associated with
higher-than-average rates of uterine cancer. Women who take it to
relieve hot flashes and other symptoms of menopause should discuss
the benefits and risks with their doctor.
   In addition to changing your lifestyle, enlist your doctor. The
chances of surviving cancer are greatest with early detection and
prompt treatment.
   Even before symptoms appear, doctors can detect cancers of the
breast, colon, prostate and cervix. As part of your regular
checkup, your doctor may recommend a number of tests to look for
these and other forms of cancer.
   For example, all women should have their breasts examined
regularly by a doctor, and should learn how to perform monthly
breast self-examination. After menopause, women should examine
their breasts the same day each month. An X-ray of the breast
(mammogram) can detect a cancer too small to be felt. Beginning at
50, women should have a mammogram each year or as recommended by a
doctor.
   Men and women over 40 should have a digital rectal exam on an
initial visit to a primary care doctor and at least every three
years after that. This is the most reliable test for prostate
cancer in men; it also can detect cancer of the rectum in men and
women.
   The stool blood test for rectal and colon cancers is recommended
yearly after age 50. In addition, most cancer specialists recommend
sigmoidoscopy, an examination of the colon and rectum with a thin,
hollow, lighted instrument which can detect cancer and noncancerous
growths. This exam is recommended at least once after age 50 and
then every three to five years after two negative exams a year
apart.
   Most cases of cervical cancer could be prevented if every woman
had a Pap test and pelvic exam regularly. The Pap test detects
cancerous cells in and around the cervix. After women have normal
test results three years in a row, their doctors may suggest they
have a Pap test less often.
   Many people automatically attribute aches and pains to growing
older. They may ignore their symptoms, assuming they are an
unavoidable part of aging. Most symptoms are not serious, but only
a doctor can tell for sure. To be safe, tell your doctor about any
unusual symptoms that last two weeks or more.
   Cancer frightens everyone. But many older people are reluctant
to discuss it with their families or doctors because they believe a
number of myths about the disease and its treatment. When they grew
up, nothing could stop cancer's deadly progress. Even the word was
whispered behind the patient's back.
   Today, however, many cancers can be treated successfully if
found early. Even better news is that the chances of surviving are
greater than ever. The best news of all is that many cancers can
even be prevented.

<HEAD>Blind Volunteers Sought in Program to Help Blind Elderly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blind Americans aged 60 and over will be
recruited as volunteers to help other visually handicapped elderly
people under a project being launched as part of the government's
Senior Companion Program.
   SCP announced Sept. 15 that it had awarded a $220,000 grant to
the American Foundation for the Blind, which will help find and
train visually impaired senior volunteers and locate other blind
seniors who need help.
   The Senior Companion Program uses low-income citizens 60 and
older to provide care and companionship to other adults to help
them live independently. The program is sponsored by ACTION, the
federal domestic volunteer agency.
   Acting ACTION Director Jane A. Kenny said the new program
targeting the blind is designed ``to focus attention on the
abilities of the disabled.''
   Under the grant, the American Foundation for the Blind will
assist four local Senior Companion Programs in developing two-year
demonstration projects, which have not been selected.
   The foundation will help develop training materials, evaluate
the projects and offer information to other SCP groups interested
in using blind volunteers or serving more visually impaired elderly
people. The New York-based, non-profit foundation is contributing
12 percent in matching dollars toward the cost of the demonstration
project.

<HEAD>Screening, Brochure Available on Leg Pains</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 3 million Americans ignore leg ache,
pain or cramps during walking or exercise as simply signs of aging,
but they could have an easily diagnosed and treated disease that
could be incapacitating.
   Peripheral arterial disease is a narrowing or blockage of
arteries, generally in the lower abdomen or extremities and
especially in the legs. The most common cause is atherosclerosis,
or hardening of the arteries.
   P.A.D. most often afflicts people over 50 and has most commonly
hit men, though women also are at increased risk because more women
are smoking. Other risk factors include diabetes, hypertension and
high fat levels in the blood.
   ``P.A.D. is easily treated if detected in its early stages,''
said Dr. Charles Kilo of Washington University School of Medicine.
   LEG ALERT, a 3-year-old program established by the National
Council on the Aging Inc., and Hoechst-Roussel Pharmaceuticals
Inc., has screened over 34,000 people. The NCOA and
Hoechst-Roussel, which makes a drug that increases blood flow, also
have prepared a booklet describing P.A.D. and what to do about it.

<HEAD>Outreach Program Aims to Increase Access to Government Benefits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An advocacy group for older Americans is
expanding its outreach program to help more elderly and disabled
poor people get the government benefits to which they are eligible.
   The American Association of Retired Persons said it will help
people in 30 communities nationwide learn about and apply for
Medicaid, food stamps, low-income home energy assistance and
Supplemental Security Income benefits.
   The outreach program earlier had been planned for 10 cities and
was focused on helping eligible people obtain SSI benefits, which
provide a minimal income floor for the nation's blind, aged and
disabled.
   A pilot SSI outreach program in 1988 in Oklahoma City,
Pittsburgh and El Paso, Texas, resulted in a 97 percent increase in
SSI applications and a 58 percent jump in SSI awards, AARP said.
   Training, community presentations and publicity are among the
methods used to reach people who may be eligible for benefits, the
group said.
   AARP's expanded outreach program, scheduled to run through 1990,
is being financed with help from The Commonwealth Fund Commission
on Elderly People Living Alone. Cities to be included in the
project will be selected after local organizations apply to assist
in the outreach program.

<HEAD>Billions Wasted on Unneeded Medical Care, Report Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans waste billions of dollars on
unneeded medical costs while nearly half the U.S. population can't
pay for decent care, says a report to a congressional study group.
   Witnesses before the panel recommend national health insurance,
national care standards to avoid unnecessary treatments, an
emphasis on preventive medicine, and a shift of more research
dollars to health problems affecting the elderly, according to the
report.
   The American health care system is ``expensive, wasteful and
denies millions of Americans even the most basic medical
attention,'' Rep. James H. Scheuer, D-N.Y., said today in releasing
the report.
   ``We spend $1.5 billion a day on health care, much more as a
share of GNP than any other industrialized nation,'' he said. ``Are
we getting our money's worth? Absolutely not.''
   The report was based on nine days of hearings conducted in 1988
by the Joint Economic Committee's subcommittee on education and
health, chaired by Scheuer. The 18-member committee is a bipartisan
economic advisory group with membership weighted in favor of the
majority party.
   Some of the findings:
   _Of the $500 billion spent in 1988 by Americans on health care,
$125 billion was spent on unneeded tests and procedures, including
many caesarean sections, pacemaker implants and coronary bypasses.
Paperwork imposes a $20 surcharge on every $100 spent for health
care, with malpractice premiums adding to that.
   _Some 37 million Americans have no insurance, 70 million more
are underinsured and 23 million are served by Medicaid, which has
declined in its ability to provide basic or equitable coverage. The
U.S. population is 240 million.
   _Twelve percent of the population is 65 and older, a group that
generates high health care costs. That will grow to one in four in
2050, with 20 percent of that group expected to be 85 and over. Yet
while incontinence, dementia and arthritis, all problems of the
elderly, produce $60 billion a year in health care costs, only $200
million is spent annually on research to combat those afflictions.
   The report recommended that until national health insurance can
be provided, Medicare must be required to implement a fee schedule
and encourage preferred provider organizations. Those are
physicians who meet cost, quality and volume expectations.
Standards of care must be developed to prevent unnecessary
treatments, it said.
   People must be encouraged to develop good habits _ such as diet
and exercise _ that will prevent illness, the report said, adding
that research priorities ``must be drastically reordered'' to focus
on diseases of the elderly.
   It also suggested seeking alternatives to malpractice lawsuits.
   The subcommittee members are Reps. Augustus F. Hawkins,
D-Calif.; Scheuer; Olympia Snowe, R-Maine; and Hamilton Fish,
R-N.Y.; and Sens. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas; Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M.;
Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn.; and Pete Wilson, R-Calif.

12-nation trading bloc.
   An OPEC spokesman, who demanded anonymity, said the discussions

   The two officials would likely discuss conditions in the
international oil market, said a spokesman for the community, also
demanding anonymity.
   Subroto, former oil minister of Indonesia, will deliver a speech
Thursday evening at the Royal Institute of International Relations
in Brussels.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Land prices in Tokyo's residential areas have
fallen for the first time since the government began keeping
records in 1975, but real estate costs have been rising elsewhere
in Japan, a report released Monday said.
   The National Land Agency said residential land prices in Tokyo
were down 4.4 percent as of July 1 from 1988, when they rose 8.1
percent.
   The highest residential land price in Japan was $88,000 a square
meter, or 10.76 square feet, in the Tokyo area, said an agency
official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The official declined to say who lives there, but Kyodo News
Service said Prime Minister Toshiko Kaifu lives in an apartment
house in that area, and owns his apartment.
   Last year's highest price was $79,000 a square meter.
   Japan's most expensive commercial land was $254,000 a square
meter at the site of a building of Meidi-Ya Co., a trading firm, in
the Ginza, Tokyo's leading shopping district. That area also was
most expensive last year, at $242,000, the official said.
   He said the report was based on a survey of land prices
conducted on July 1 at 25,216 spots throughout the nation.
   The official said the nation's average land price went up by 6.8
percent from a year earlier in residential areas and 7.5 percent in
commercial areas, compared with 7.4 percent for residential land
and 8.0 percent for commercial land last year.
   In Osaka and neighboring areas in western Japan, residential
land prices rose 37.3 percent from a year earlier, compared with an
increase of 26.9 percent last year.
   In Sanrizuka, land prices went up 96 percent, the highest in
Japan this year, to $317 a square meter from $162.

   The estimated cost of building the English Channel
tunnel has jumped to $11.20 billion from $7.80 billion two years
ago, developers Eurotunnel PLC said Monday.
   The builders and banks for the 31-mile underwater rail link
between Britain and France say the price tag is likely to go higher.
   Eurotunnel, the Anglo-French consortium, said it will probably
turn to shareholders and its creditor bankers to raise extra money
in 1990 or 1991. It originally raised $9.66 billion from
shareholders and a syndicate of 200 banks worldwide.
   Eurotunnel has puts the completion date at June 15, 1993.

<HEAD>New Competition Bringing Down International Phone Rates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARI YAMAGUCHI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The company that held a monopoly on Japan's
international telephone service will cut its rates by 14 percent
next month to compete with two new rivals, officials said Monday.
   Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co. Ltd. began receiving telephone service
competition Sunday from the new International Telecom Japan and
International Digital Communications.
   The new companies started with service to the United States and
Hong Kong, the two places called most frequently from Japan,
company officials said.
   IDC plans to extend its services to Britain and Singapore later
this year, and to Taiwan next year, company spokesman Koyo Taura
said.
   ITJ said it also would be serving Singapore, Britain and France
by November, and such places as South Korea, Taiwan, Australia and
West Germany next year.
   Government officials said they hoped the new competition would
help the international telephone business grow in Japan.
   While domestic phone calls produce about $33.7 billion a year in
profit, the international phone business in Japan has been worth
only $1.44 billion in annual profit, said Takaharu Yamamoto,
spokesman for the Post and Telecommunication Ministry.
   Two years ago, the average Japanese called overseas only once a
year, he said.
   The two newcomers' normal daytime rates for three-minute calls
to the United States are $4.86, lower than KDD's current $6.35,
Taura said.
   The Post and Telecommunication Ministry's recent approval for
KDD's percent rate cut starting Nov. 1, to $5.20, would narrow the
price gap, making competition keener, he added.
   KDD has reduced its rates nine times since 1979, said KDD
spokesman Shinichiro Terada. The largest reduction was last year's
21 percent cut, said the post ministry's Yamamoto.
   Japan long has been criticized for expensive international phone
call rates.
   ``It used to be almost twice as expensive to call from Japan to
America, we admit that,'' Yamamoto said.
   But the gap has been narrowing, and will narrow further with
healthy competition in Japan, Yamamoto added.
   Currrently, AT&amp;T Co., America's largest long distance carrier,
charges $6.02 for a three-minute daytime call to Japan. U.S. Sprint
Communications Co., a competitor, charges $5.67, Yamamoto said.

   The stock market declined slightly today,

   Construction spending rose 1.8 percent in
August, its first advance in three months and the largest this
year, the government said today in a report indicating the building
industry may be pulling out of its slump.
   The Commerce Department said spending increased $7.3 billion to
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $421.8 billion last month.
That followed decreases of 0.6 percent in July and 0.8 percent in
June. Spending rose 1.4 percent in May.
   The August advance was the biggest since a 2.3 percent gain in
December 1988.
   It was thought earlier the industry decline had bottomed out
when the Commerce Department reported that July construction
spending posted a tiny fractional increase of 0.02 percent.
However, additional information caused a downward revision in that
report.
   Analysts have been looking for a pickup in construction spending
ever since interest rates began falling earlier in the year.
Fixed-rate mortgage rates declined from a peak of 11.22 percent in
March to 10.22 at the end of August, according to a survey by the
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Co.
   In today's report, the department said residential construction
dropped a miniscule 0.05 percent to an annual rate of $198.9
billion, with single-family construction off 0.2 percent to an
annual rate of $113.1 billion.
   Apartment buildings gained 0.4 percent to $23.5 billion on an
annual rate.
   Non-residential construction showed a 2.9 percent increase to an
annual rate of $100.3 billion. A 4.5 percent increase in office
buildings and a 1.8 percent gain in factory buildings led the
advance.
   Government construction rose 5.3 percent to an annual rate of
$86 billion as the largest government category, highway building,
rebounded 4.2 percent after falling 4.5 percent in July.
   The total construction figure was up 3.4 percent from the level
of building a year ago.

   Japan's ``bullet train,'' named for its shape and
high-speed, is 25 years old.
   The train began service on Oct. 1, 1964, running at speeds of up
to 131 miles an hour and making the 324-mile run between Tokyo and
Osaka, in western Japan, in 3 hours, 20 minutes.
   ``Since then, the bullet trains have carried 2.7 billion
passengers between Tokyo and Osaka,'' said Tomoko Shimokawa, a
spokeswoman for Japan Railways, the private company that replaced
the government-owned railroad in April 1987.
   The train never has been involved in a major accident.
   The introduction of bullet train services in 1964, shortly
before the Tokyo Olympic Games, was seen as a symbol of Japan's
remarkable postwar economic recovery.
   The Tokyo-Osaka run has since been cut to three hours, with
trains running at up to 138 miles an hour, Ms. Shimokawa said
Monday.
   In 1975, the original line from Tokyo was extended past Osaka to
Hakata, on the southernmost main island of Kyushu, 563 miles west
of Tokyo.
   In the late 1980s, new lines were added from Tokyo to Morioka,
289 miles to the north, and from Tokyo to Niigata, 160 miles
northwest of the capital.
   The fastest train on the line to Morioka runs at up to 150 miles
an hour, the railway says.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Zenith Electronics Corp. said today it was
selling its fast-growing computer group to the French company
Groupe Bull to concentrate on consumer electronics, the weaker
segment of its business.
   Zenith is the last major U.S.-headquartered manufacturer of
televisions, a business that has usually lost money for the company
in recent years.
   Zenith said in a statement it expected the purchase price for
the computer business to be less than $635 million, with the exact
amount to be based on the net asset value of the computer business
when the deal is closed, probably by the end of the year.
   The deal is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval.
   Sales of Glenview, Ill.-based Zenith's computer systems and
components expanded by 23 percent to $1.6 billion last year
compared to a 2.7 percent increase in consumer-electronics sales,
which totaled $1.1 billion.
   Despite its fast growth, Zenith Chairman Jerry K. Pearlman said
the computer business was saddled with a large amount of debt that
had restricted Zenith's ability to realize the full potential of
its consumer electronics division.
   ``Zenith will emerge as a conservatively financed company better
prepared to capitalize on our strengths in consumer electronics,''
Pearlman said in a statement.
   Zenith said it will concentrate on ``new consumer electronics
and component technologies, particularly high-definition television
and advanced high-resolution color displays.''
   Zenith's stock surged more than $2 a share, to $16.75 from
Friday's close of $14.50, in early trading today on the New York
Stock Exchange. Pearlman estimated the book value of Zenith's stock
after the sale at $19 a share.
   Charles Ryan, an analyst with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., said the deal
represented good value for stockholders. He said that with the
proceeds from the sale, Zenith could retire about $300 million of
its debt load and invest heavily in emerging video technologies
such as high-definition television and its own flat-mask video
display, an industry standard.
   ``This takes a company in the red that was becoming quite
financially shaky into very sound financial condition,'' Ryan said.
   Zenith spokesman John Taylor said the company had $167 million
in short-term debt and $309 million in long-term debt at the end of
the second quarter.
   Zenith turned a profit of $11.7 million last year _ its first
annual profit in four years _ but had a net loss of $17 million for
the first half of 1989.

Coal Co. and Rob Fork Mining Co. in Kentucky to begin at midnight
Sunday, said Dean Bentley, UMW International representative.
Bentley and company officials today confirmed that the mines, with
about 250 union workers total, had been shut down.
   In West Virginia, about 120 UMW members went on strike today at
five coal companies, a spokesman there said.
   ``The union found them doing business with Pittston, they found
them aligning themselves with them and supporting them,'' said
Danny Wells, executive board member at UMW District 17 in West
Virginia. He said ``there's no way to tell'' how long it will last.
   Kentucky State Police and company officials reported no problems
on the picket lines, and Wells said the situation was also peaceful
in West Virginia.
   Members of the union's international committee met Sunday with
UMW Local 1468, representing about 200 Sunglo miners, and Local
1812, representing about 50 workers at Rob Fork Mining, formerly
known as Beth Energy. Both mines are in southern Pike County in
eastern Kentucky.
   ``They said they had solid proof (the mines) were selling coal
to Pittston and that's the reason the local is being called out on
selective strike,'' said Charles Spartman, an officer of Local 1468.
   The companies affected in West Virginia, all in Logan County,
are the M&amp;H Coal Co.; War Eagle Construction Co.; Gar Coal Co.;
Auger Resources, and Can Run Coal Co., Well said.
   About 1,700 UMW members went on strike against Pittston in
Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky in April after working more
than a year without a contract. Among the issues the union has been
unable to resolve with Pittston include insurance and pension
benefits, and hiring non-union labor.
   Wildcat strikes related to the Pittston dispute affected tens of
thousands of union miners at other companies in June and July.
   Phil Lucas, superintendent of Rob Fork Mine 29 and processing
plant, said he didn't know if the company was filling Pittston's
orders. He said the company has salesmen who handle coal shipments
but could not provide their names or any other details.
   There was no comment from Sunglo mine manager I.C. Spotte.
People who answered the telephone at one Sunglow mine said Spotte
was at another mine, where there was no answer.
   Leonard Fleming, co-administrator for UMW District 30 in
Pikeville, said Spotte has denied to the union that the company was
helping Pittston, but he was ``confident w can prove our case in
any court of law that they are filling Pittston's order.''
   UMW spokesman Joe Corcoran said the union is looking at other
unspecified companies in the three states to see if they also are
assisting Pittston.

   An importer of fine Spanish porcelain that
accuses another company of illegally selling the product in the
United States at a discount lost a Supreme Court appeal today.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that permitted
the so-called ``gray market'' import of Lladro porcelain.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had ruled last May in
favor of Jalyn Corp. of New Jersey and against Weil Ceramics and
Glass Inc., a New York firm.
   The appeals court relied in part on a 1988 Supreme Court ruling
that upheld a lion's share of the multibillion-dollar gray market.
   The justices said then that the U.S. Customs Service does not
have to shut down the gray market _ famous-name, foreign-made goods
bearing valid U.S. trademarks sold in this country at reduced
prices without approval from trademark owners.
   Weil Ceramics is a wholly owned subsidiary of Lladro Exportadora
of Spain. Weil became the exclusive U.S. distributor of the
hand-made porcelain in 1966, and later was acquired by the Spanish
company.
   Jalyn Corp. and its president, Bernard Dash, began importing
Lladro porcelain in 1982.
   Weil, seeking to collect damages and block the rival imports,
sued Jalyn over alleged trademark infringement.
   The 3rd Circuit court rejected Weil's arguments that the Supreme
Court's 1988 ruling does not apply to it because it is the
independent owner of the U.S. trademark for Lladro porcelain.
   ``Although Weil was not a sham incorporated by Lladro with the
specific intent to benefit from the protection of the trademark
act, its present relationship with Lladro nonetheless presents the
potential for undesired monopoly of the domestic (U.S.) market,''
the appeals court said.
   Weil said it should have exclusive rights to sell the porcelain
in this country because its marketing, promotion and distribution
efforts have built the popularity of the Lladro name.
   The case is Weil Ceramics vs. Dash, 89-173.

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices rose sharply in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade amid signs the
Soviet Union has returned in a big way to the U.S. agricultural
markets.
   Corn futures soared the permitted daily limit of 10 cents a
pound shortly after the opening on rumors the Soviets had bought
1.5 million to 2 million metric tons of U.S. corn over the weekend.
   Rumors of an impending Soviet corn purchase had simmered through
the markets last week despite statements last month by the Soviet
Union's grain-buying agency that the country would purchase no more
grain this year.
   Further buying of grain futures was prompted by a news service's
report that an agricultural aide to President Bush had said an
``unprecedented'' sale of U.S. farm goods to the Soviets would be
announced soon.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 1{ cents to 4{ cents higher
wiith the contract for delivery in December at $4.11} a bushel;
corn futures were 9 cents to 10 cents higher with December at $2.43
a bushel; oats were 4\ cents to 5 cents higher with December at
$1.48\ a bushel; soybeans were 8} cents to 18 cents higher with
November at $5.86 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were higher in
early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .35 cent higher with October at
71.92 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .13 cent lower
with October at 82.82 cents a pound; live hogs were .05 cent to .78
cent higher with October at 44 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .40 cent to .78 cent higher with February at 48.77 cents a
pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mixed on Friday.

   USX Corp. said today it is offering to sell
the oil and natural gas reserves of its Texas Oil &amp; Gas Corp.
subsidiary.
   The oil and steel giant said it has retained the investment
banking firm First Boston Corp. to handle the sale. The reserves
are mainly located in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana,
Colorado and Kansas.
   USX, based in Pittsburgh, issued 133 million shares of stock in
1986 to acquire Texas Oil &amp; Gas in a deal valued at around $3
billion. USX has been disappointed by the company's earnings ever
since. The parent has pinned its hopes for a turnaround at Texas
Oil &amp; Gas on the prospect of natural gas prices surging.
   A sale is anticipated by year's end, said USX spokesman William
E. Keslar, who declined to say what value USX places on the
reserves.
   Texas Oil &amp; Gas has 1.2 trillion cubic feet of gas in reserve,
about a quarter of the 3.5 trillion cubic feet held by the other
USX subsidiary, Marathon Oil Co. Texas Oil &amp; Gas has 28 million
barrels of oil, or 3 percent of Marathon's 766 million barrels.
   The bulk of Texas Oil &amp; Gas' business is natural gas gathering,
which would not be affected by the sale. The subsidiary also would
retain its contract drilling business.

   The stock market was little changed today,
getting off to a sluggish start on the last quarter of 1989.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 1.33 to 2,694.15 by
noontime on Wall Street.
   Losers slightly outnumbered gainers in nationwide trading of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 635 up, 647 down and 532

   Analysts said prices backtracked a bit in the absence of the
end-of-quarter buying by investing institutions that helped support
the market last week.
   They said the atmosphere was characterized more by an absence of

   But brokers noted that the report contained few surprises for
investors, and actually indicated a modest improvement from August.

<HEAD>Odd Position For The Fed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   You have the assurance of a person with 60 years
of experience that there will be no recession so long as interest
rates remain high.
   That might sound odd, because conventional thinking associates
high or rising interest rates with a downturn sometime in the
future. This fellow says high rates will protect us from recession.
   Albert Sindlinger has been analyzing public and economic opinion
for close to six decades, during the past three of them through
information gathered from an average of 110 telephone calls a day,
seven days a week.
   The staff of Sindlinger &amp; Co. asks probing personal questions of
a scientific sample of households, and obtains remarkably straight
answers. Out of each interview comes about 95 pieces of information.
   The staff is especially interested in levels of income compared
with six months earlier, and income expectations for the next six
months. They ask about job security, and about the household's view
of business six months ahead.
   Albert Sindlinger, a pioneer in consumer research, analyzes the
data. Of late, that data has suggested a lot of Americans feel
rather well-heeled. As usual, he wanted to know why and made sure
his staff probed into the subject.
   Answer any question asked by a canny interviewer and you're
likely to provide more information than you realize. One bit of
information stood out: People felt comfortable because they are
getting good returns on their savings.
   This is part of what often is referred to as the wealth effect,
although it is a lot more complicated than that. With banks
deregulated _ remember the old days of 5.25 percent interest a year
_ people know they can get good returns.
   To say that they have gone ``yield crazy'' may be an
exaggeration, although Sindlinger used the term a couple of times.
But they are squeezing every nickel they can out of their assets in
savings bonds, certificates of deposit, corporate and junk bonds.
   It is an accepted dictum of market psychology that when
consumers feel comfortable they are inclined to spend. This being
so, says Sindlinger, there's a real question of whether the Fed can
wrestle inflation by raising rates.
   But these people also carry a lot of debt, too. Sure they do,
says Sindlinger, but never forget that you can't go into debt
unless you have assets _ not just a nest egg of collateral but a
good secure job too.
   This situation tends to feed inflation, but there is more: For
the first time in seven years, Sindlinger is finding an ominous
rise in the wage demands of service workers. That also is an
inflationary sign.
   The stock market? Sindlinger is finding that while households
might have debts, some of those debts are going to finance stock
purchases, adding to the wealth effect.
   This debt situation, household and corporate, might cause
problems down the road, but he believes the immediate impact is to
sustain a relatively high level of stock prices, together with a
sense of financial well-being.
   Many people feel capitalistic today, he said. About 20 years ago
fewer than 25 percent of households had $100,000 of liquid assets.
Now, he says, 55 percent do. It's a bullish feeling, even if
$100,000 isn't what it used to be.
   As Sindlinger sees it, the household financial condition
explains why House Democrats lost the battle of capital gains
taxes. He says too many of their old constituents think of
themselves as taxpayers rather than tax recipients.
   But the biggest lesson of all, he maintains, is for the Federal
Reserve Board. That august body, he says, appears to be in the
position of trying to fight inflation via high interest rates, but
is fueling it instead.

<HEAD>Court Opens Term With Rulings on Worker Safety, Energy Exploration</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Monday allowed states to
file criminal charges against companies accused of neglecting the
health and safety of workers and limited Alaska's efforts to
control offshore energy exploration. In another business-related
decision as the court opened a new term, the justices refused to
take up an antitrust controversy stemming from the once-planned
acquisition by Thomas J. Lipton Inc. of Kraft Inc.'s Celestial
Seasonings Inc. two years ago.
   Competitor R.C. Bigelow Inc. had claimed in a federal lawsuit
that a merger would create a monopoly. A federal judged favored
Lipton, but an appeals court reinstated the suit, saying the deal,
which was later canceled, was in apparent violation of antitrust
laws.
   In the worker-safety decision, the Supreme Court let stand a
ruling in an Illinois case that federal workplace regulations don't
bar state prosecutions.
   Five officials of Chicago Magnet Wire Corp. await trial on
charges of recklessly injuring 42 workers by exposing them to toxic
chemicals, extreme heat and other unsafe conditions at a
wire-coating plant.
   But Chicago Magnet Wire officials argued criminal charges should
be dropped because the federal government pre-empted state
prosecutions when it enacted the Occupational Safety and Health Act
of 1970. The company said worker safety should be part of uniform
national standards.
   The Illinois Supreme Court last February ruled that state
criminal law ``can provide a valuable and forceful supplement to
insure that workers are adequately protected.''
   In the case involving Alaska, the high court left intact rulings
that allowed the federal government last year to sell leases on 5.6
million acres of Bristol Bay, off Alaska's southwestern coast.
   The court turned away warnings by Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper and
others that an oil spill in Bristol Bay could do more environmental
harm than the massive Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska's Prince William
Sound last March.
   The disputed leases were sold for nearly $100 million after a
federal judge and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected a
challenge by Cowper and numerous enviromental groups, fishing
associations and Alaska communities.
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun voted to hear arguments in the case
but four votes are needed to grant such review.
   In other business-related decisions Monday, the Supreme Court:
   _Asked the Bush administration for its views on broadening the
power of states to sue on behalf of gas consumers allegedly
overcharged by utility companies.
   _Agreed to decide whether a federal law unfairly makes it too
difficult for coal miners who contract ``black lung'' disease to
obtain a lawyer's help when seeking benefits.
   _Agreed to decide whether farm workers who suffer
transportation-related injuries may sue their employers after
receiving worker-compensation benefits.
   _Decided to consider placing new limits on the ability of
convicted criminals to avoid making restitution to their victims by
declaring bankruptcy.
   _Refused to hear an appeal by non-union Pennsylvania state
employees who oppose paying the equivalent of dues to a union that
represents them in collective bargaining.
   _Refused to reinstate a $3.5 million damage award a Missouri
television station owner won, and then lost, against Capital
Cities-ABC Inc.
   _Let stand a ruling that allows the so-called ``gray market''
import of Lladro porcelain by permitting a firm to sell the product
even though another company is the exclusive U.S. distributor.
   _Let stand a $1.2 million bonus in fees awarded to the lawyers
for consumers who sued over allegedly defective transmissions in
some General Motors Corp. cars.
   _Refused to disturb a state's ban on telephone solicitation for
pre-arranged funerals.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Surge on Rumored USSR Corn Purchase</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn futures prices soared Monday on the Chicago
Board of Trade amid rumblings of a major Soviet purchase of U.S.
corn, and the other grain and soybean markets went along for the
ride.
   Rumors that the Soviet Union had bought as much as 3 million
metric tons of corn over the weekend sent futures prices for the
commodity up the permitted dily limit of 10 cents a bushel shortly
after the opening.
   The other markets rose in sympathy with corn, but prices
retreated from their highs across the board in afternooon trading
when ``the biggest thing was profit-taking,'' said Victor
Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   Rumors of an impending Soviet corn purchase had simmered through
the markets last week, despite statements last month by Russia's
grain-buying agency that the Soviet Union would purchase no more
grain this year.
   At the close, wheat futures were \ cent to 4\ cents higher with
the contract for delivery in December at $4.07{ a bushel; corn was
5{ cents to 8\ cents higher with December at $2.41\ a bushel; oats
were 2} cents to 4\ cents higher with December at $1.46} a bushel;
soybeans were 3} cents to 11 cents higher with November at $5.76 a

   International Business Machines Corp. said
Monday it is offering special payments to people who quit or retire
at four locations, a step that is expected to cut 600 to 1,000 jobs.
   The job cuts, which are voluntary, represent less than half of 1
percent of IBM's U.S. work force of 223,000.
   The four locations are Owego, N.Y., and Manassas, Va., where IBM
makes specialized equipment for defense contracts; Endicott, N.Y.,
where it makes the 9370 line of minicomputers; and Lexington, Ky.,
where it makes typewriters and printers.
   Most of the people who will be offered the special payments are
in administrative and support areas of the company, IBM spokesman
John Reilly said. They will be given a bonus of one week's pay for
each six months they have worked for IBM, up to a maximum of one
year's pay.
   IBM spokesman Peter Thonis said the cost of the cuts would not
significantly hurt the company's profits. He said the cuts were not
related to a slowdown in sales of products made at the four
locations.

   State legal and consumer officials said
Monday that, after a successful sting operation, they were suing a
Pennsylvania company over alleged deceptive techniques in marketing
the ``Contour Chair'' _ a chair advertised on television by
entertainer Art Linkletter.
   Acting Attorney General Clarine Nardi Riddle said claims that
the chairs, which are sold through presentations in customers'
homes, were custom fitted for individual consumers were false.
   She also said salesmen deceived buyers in offering
senior-citizen and other discounts when there was no original
retail price for the chair, which she said sells for anywhere from
$2,800 to more than $4,000.
   The suit, filed in Hartford Superior Court Sept. 19, charges use
of false and deceptive sales techniques by the distributor, Contour
Lounge Inc. of Bensalem, Pa., its president, Mark S. Levinthan of
Huntington Valley, Pa., and the manufacturer, Craftmatic-Contour
Organization Inc. of Trevose, Pa.
   The suit seeks to have the company barred from doing business in
Connecticut. Riddle said that the state of Washington has already
obtained a cease-and-desist order against the company and others _
Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Oregon, as well as the city of Denver,
Colo. _ are trying.
   Charles B. Chernofsky, the lawyer for Craftmatic-Contour, said
the company's sales techniques were standard in the business.
   ``I'm sorry for the way they feel, but ... Contour is really
doing nothing that I've been able to determine ... that's wrong,''
Chernofsky said.
   He said the chairs are, in fact, ``custom made for each
customer'' including the size, fabric and various configurations of
``viviration units'' _ vibrators and heating units _ preferred by
each customer.
   All those factors, he said, affect the price of the chair,
accounting for differences in prices that customers paid.
   Riddle said the sting included employees of the Department of
Consumer Protection posing as interested customers. The employees
were secretly ``wired'' and taped the sales presentations that
allegedly used false and deceptive claims, including offering
discounts that didn't exist, according to Consumer Protection
Commissioner Mary M. Heslin.
   ``This is an important case because these chairs are advertised
extensively on television and also because we've had problems with
their sales techniques before,'' Riddle said, adding that 281 of
the chairs had been sold in Connecticut.
   She said the sales techniques violated terms of a court
settlement two years ago between the company and the state. She
also said that the salesmen claimed that the chairs were medical
devices and endorsed by the American Medical Association and
claimed that the company's sales materials and business practices
had been approved by Riddle's office.
   Chernofsky said the problems encountered in other states were
not directly related to the chairs themselves, but with
distributors who had difficulty filling orders.
   He said the company would vigorously challenge the allegations
in court.

<HEAD>Coke Board Approves Columbia Sale to Sony</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coca-Cola Co.'s board of directors on Monday
approved the sale of its stock in Columbia Pictures Entertainment
Inc. to Sony Corp. and said it would use the money _ $1.45 billion
_ for its soft drink operations and buying back some of its own
stock.
   The Coca-Cola board gave its formal OK to the sale of the
company's 53.8 million shares of Columbia Pictures to Sony USA
Inc., a subsidiary of the Sony Corp. The board also authorized the
purchase of up to 20 million shares of Coca-Cola stock through 1991.
   The deal will bring Coke an after-tax gain of some $530 million,
or $1.53 per share, this year, the company said.
   Sony reached an agreement to buy Columbia last week, with Sony
paying $27 a share, for a total cost of $3.4 billion. At that
price, Coke's take comes to $1.45 billion.
   Coke entered the movie business in 1982, when it bought a
predecessor of Columbia.
   ``Our investment in the entertainment business has provided
substantial value and outstanding returns to our shareholders,''
Coca-Cola Chairman Roberto C. Goizueta said in a statement. ``We
see excellent opportunities to continue to build ... through growth
of and further investments in our worldwide soft drink business,
and by instituting a new share repurchase program.''

   A round of afternoon buying carried the stock
market to a four-week high in light trading Monday, getting Wall
Street off to a positive start on the last quarter of 1989.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 20.90 to 2,713.72,
its highest close since it stood at 2,719.79 on Sept. 6.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
861 up, 598 down and 509 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 127.41 million
shares, down from 155.30 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 150.85 million shares.
   Analysts said traders had been braced for a pullback in the
absence of the end-of-quarter buying by investing institutions that
helped support the market last week.
   But in early trading prices steadied after a brief and shallow
decline, suggesting that the market faced little selling pressure.
   The results of a monthly survey of corporate purchasing
executives, released this morning, showed continued softness in the
manufacturing sector of the economy during September.
   Brokers noted, however, that the report contained few surprises
for investors, and actually indicated a modest improvement from
August.
   USX, which said it was looking for buyers for the oil and gas
reserves of its Texas Oil &amp; Gas subsidiary, climbed 1} to 34~,
making a health contribution to the Dow's gain.
   Coca-Cola, meanwhile, rose 1{ to 68{. The company said it would
realize a $500 million-plus profit from the sale of its stake in
Columbia Pictures Entertainment to Sony Corp.
   Directors also authorized the repurchase of as many as 20
million shares through 1991.
   Elsewhere among the blue chips, General Electric rose 1\ to 57};
Exxon ] to 45[; Eastman Kodak 1| to 48, and DuPont 2\ to 122.
   Harcourt Brace Jovanovich led the active list, down 1~ at 10\ on
top of a 4[-point drop Friday. The selloff was attributed to
disappointment over the $1.1 billion price at which HBJ agreed to
sell its theme parks to Anheuser Busch.
   Kellogg dropped 2\ to 73[. The company said it expected to
report lower earnings for the third quarter, citing intense
competition in the ready-to-eat cereal business.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $16.41 billion, or
0.48 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .93 to 194.90.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 2.07 to 400.02, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 1.72 at 350.87.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added
2.27 to 475.19. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value

<HEAD>Two-Year Extension of Coffee Agreement Is Backed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A two-year extension of the International Coffee
Agreement has received the necessary backing of importing and
exporting nations, allowing it to take effect without new
provisions for price supports, officials said Monday.
   The announcement by the International Coffee Organization
coincided with the resumption of talks among coffee-trading nations
aimed at reopening negotiations on a replacement accord.
   Some 41 exporting and 18 importing countries have notified the
United Nations that they accept the extended coffee agreement, said
Alexandre Beltrao, the coffee organization's executive director.
   The backers include Brazil, Colombia, the Ivory Coast, Mexico,
El Salvador, Indonesia, Uganda and all other key exporters.
   The United States, the world biggest importer, all members of
the European Community, Canada, Switzerland and Japan have also
accepted the extended agreement.
   The agreement maintains the International Coffee Organization as
a forum for discussing matters of mutual concern to exporters and
importers including the shape of any possible new agreement on
quotas.
   The coffee pact's price-support clauses, allowing exports to be
controlled by quotas to stabilize prices, were suspended
indefinitely on July 4.
   Since then, the market has dropped to a 14-year low, triggering
efforts by Colombia to bring coffee-trading nations back to the
negotiating table to agree a new pact.
   But talks in London last week failed to remove the obstacles in
the way of reopening negotiations.

<HEAD>USX Puts Texas Oil &amp; Gas Reserves on Block</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARL BOHN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   USX Corp. Monday offered to sell the natural
gas and oil reserves of its Texas Oil &amp; Gas Corp. subsidiary in
what is being viewed on Wall Street as a concession to shareholders.
   Texas Oil &amp; Gas has been a disappointment to USX since it was
acquired in 1986 in a $3 billion stock swap.
   ``I think shareholders have just lost their patience,'' said
David N. Fleischer of Prudential Bache Securities.
   USX is showing a willingness to part with assets that probably
will appreciate if held long enough but could enhance the stock's
value now by being sold, he said.
   ``This is a very strong statement that they're committed to
shareholders,'' Fleischer said.
   Chief among the shareholders who stand to benefit is corporate
raider Carl Icahn, who is holding an 11 percent stake in USX.
   Fleischer and analyst Frank Bracken of Fidelity Investments of
Boston said they valued the reserves at around $1.5 billion. A sale
is anticipated by year's end, said USX spokesman William E. Keslar,
who declined to say how USX values the reserves.
   The Pittsburgh-based oil and steel giant said it has retained
the investment banking firm First Boston Corp. to handle the sale.
The reserves are principally located in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas,
Louisiana, Colorado and Kansas.
   After racking up impressive operating income of $547 million and
$377 million in 1984 and 1985 respectively, Texas Oil &amp; Gas
reported an operating loss of $21 million the year USX acquired it,
then broke about even with $2 million the next year and lost $31
million last year.
   ``I estimate that TXO's producing properties are losing $30 to
$40 million per year on an operating basis,'' said Fleischer.
   The sale, besides boosting Texas Oil &amp; Gas's earnings, will help
with USX's goal of reducing debt and may lead to the repurchase of
stock or raise the dividend, he said.
   USX had been pinning its hopes for a turnaround at Texas Oil &amp;
Gas on the prospect that natural gas prices will surge.
   Texas Oil &amp; Gas has 1.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in
reserve, about a quarter of the 3.5 trillion cubic feet held by the
other USX subsidiary, Marathon Oil Co. Texas Oil &amp; Gas has 28
million barrels of oil, or 3 percent of Marathon's 766 million.
   The sale would not affect gas gathering, the bulk of Texas Oil &amp;
Gas's business, or contract drilling, USX said.
   Gas gathering accounted for $538 million of Texas Oil &amp; Gas's
$937 million in total sales last year. Drilling and other activites
had sales totaling $41 million.
   The remainder, or $358 million, came from petroleum sales.

   Nissan Motor Corp. car sales should drop
in 1990 although it expects its truck sales to increase, led by its
new four-door Pathfinder sport-utility vehicle, a Nissan executive
said Monday.
   Overall, sales throughout the industry in 1990 will drop to
about 14 million cars and trucks from nearly 15 million in 1989,
said Bob Thomas, general manager of the Nissan Division of Nissan
Motor Corp. in U.S.A., the Japanese company's U.S. marketing arm.
   Thomas said Nissan's share of that market should be about
660,000 vehicles in each year. Nissan's car sales in 1990 should
drop by about 0.8 percent but truck sales should rise by 2.5
percent.
   Thomas estimated the four-door Pathfinder would make up 90
percent of the vehicle's U.S. sales of about 31,000 vehicles. About
24,000 two-door Pathfinders were sold in the United States during
the 1989 model year, but Thomas said that number would drop
drastically because of price increases needed to recover tariff
costs effective on the 1990 models.
   The Treasury Department, under rules announced earlier this
year, classified the four-door version of the imported Pathfinder
as a car, making it subject to a 2.5 percent tariff.
   Nissan officials had worried that the four-door Pathfinder would
be classified as a truck, making it subject to a 25 percent import
duty.
   Nissan now makes pickup trucks and Sentra automobiles at its
Smyrna, Tenn., plant. Thomas projected that Sentra sales will fall
to about 180,000 cars in the 1990 model year, down 21.1 percent
from the 228,000 the company expects to sell in the 1989 model
year. Sales of U.S. built pickup trucks should increase slightly,
he said.
   When asked if a larger car would be made at the Smyrna plant,
Thomas said only that it would be two to three model years away.
However, he later said a redesigned Stanza would be offered at
about the same time, and with design work done in California, ``at
that time it could be an all-American vehicle.''
   He predicted the newly redesigned 1990 Stanza would more than
double U.S. sales for the nameplate during the 1990 model year. He
also forecast that sales of the 300ZX sports car would rise in
1990, with sales of other cars flat or lower.

<TEXT>
   Striking Eastern Airlines pilots and Machinists
unions said Monday they filed a civil racketeering lawsuit against
Texas Air Corp., company chairman Frank Lorenzo and two subsidiary
airlines.
   The lawsuit seeks relief for damages to employees and
shareholders from a pattern of ``fraudulent empire-building,
misrepresentation, extortion, asset-stripping and criminal activity
against Eastern Airlines unions,'' the Air Line Pilots Association
said.
   A spokesman for the clerk's office at the federal court in Miami
was unable to confirm receipt of the documents on Monday afternoon,
but ALPA attorney Michael Harwood confirmed that he had filed the
papers.
   The action, a counterclaim to an earlier lawsuit filed by
Eastern, charges violations of the federal Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act by the company.
   ALPA spokesman Ron Cole said many of the allegations have been
made to the bankruptcy court in New York, but the racketeering
complaint was filed because the progress of the bankruptcy case has
been slow.
   Eastern spokesman Robin Robin Mattell said the lawsuit was
without merit.
   In a separate action Monday, a federal bankruptcy judge in New
York granted an injunction to Eastern blocking another union
lawsuit from being tried in the Miami district court. That suit,
filed by ALPA alone on Sept. 1, challenges Eastern's recent
practice of leasing DC-9 jets and flight crews from sister carrier
Continental Airlines.
   In a hearing before U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland,
ALPA attorney Bruce Simon contended that Eastern violated its
collective bargaining agreement with the pilots union by leasing
the planes and crews from Houston-based Continental. Bruce
Zirinsky, a lawyer for Eastern, insisted that the leasing
arrangement didn't violate any labor agreements and was vital to
Eastern's rebuilding effort.
   Lifland agreed, saying that the loss of the leasing arrangement
_ now involving 16 jets and crews _ could cause ``irreparable
harm'' to Eastern.
   In the corruption countersuit, the unions alleged a pattern of
racketeering activity in violation of the securities laws, mail and
wire fraud statutes and other federal laws. In addition to Texas
Air, Lorenzo and Eastern, the lawsuit names subsidiary Continental
and Lorenzo's Jet Capital Corp.
   The lawsuit seeks multimillion-dollar damages and relief to be
determined by the court. The civil RICO statute allows juries to
award triple damages.
   Because Eastern is in bankruptcy proceedings in New York, the
unions said they will ask for a release from the bankruptcy court
to press the claims against Eastern.
   Texas Air filed a civil RICO lawsuit against ALPA and the
International Association of Machinists in May 1988 accusing
Eastern unions of trying to wreck the airline in order to force its
sale at a loss.
   Eastern's Machinists, pilots and flight attendants walked off
the job last March 4 and Eastern filed for bankruptcy protection
from creditors five days later.

   The U.S. economy's manufacturing sector remained
weak in September, although orders for exports increased sharply in
spite of a stronger dollar, the nation's corporate purchasing
managers said Monday.
   The Purchasing Managers' Index, a widely watched barometer of
the economy's direction, rose to 46 percent from 45.2 percent in
August and matched the rate for July.
   A reading below 50 percent indicates the manufacturing sector of
the economy is in decline while a reading above 50 percent
indicates growth, according to the National Association of
Purchasing Management.
   Survey responses indicated new export orders rose during the
month while prices continued falling, and production, employment,
new orders and inventories all declined.
   The mixed picture painted by the managers left economists
divided in their opinions of where U.S. manufacturing is headed in
coming months.
   ``This is a report that is filled with cross currents. It
doesn't have a black and white picture that the economy is doing
great,'' said Allen Sinai, economist with Boston Co. and Economic
Advisers Inc.
   The monthly report is based on a survey of purchasing executives
in more than 250 industrial companies. The index is a composite of
five separate indicators, including new orders, production, vendor
deliveries, inventories and employment.
   The September overall index represented only a slight upturn
from the August reading, which had been the lowest for the index
since December 1982, although the overall index averaged 49.5
percent for the first three quarters of 1989.
   ``Past experience indicates that if this average were to
continue for the final quarter, it would be consistent with real
GNP growth of about 1.7 percent for all of 1989,'' said Robert J.
Bretz, survey chairman.
   But Bretz also said the index would have to fall below 44
percent to show economic contraction for the year.
   A sharp increase in export orders came despite the strength in
the U.S. dollar during September. Some 60.5 percent of those
surveyed reported their volume of new export orders rose during the
month, compared with 56 percent in August. It was the highest level
since April when the New Export Order index was 62 percent.
   The seasonally adjusted indexes for the five separate indicators
represent the net change between those reporting positive, negative
and similar responses from the previous month.
   The report also indicated inflation eased for the fourth
consecutive month in September, with the index remaining at 43.1
percent. Ten percent of those surveyed reported higher prices,
compared with 13 percent in August, and 25 percent reported lower
prices, compared with 30 percent in August.
   The production index rose to 48.5 percent from 46.5 percent in
August while the employment index rose to 45.9 percent from 44.7
percent.
   The index for new orders moved up to 45.4 percent from 45.1
percent in the previous month. And the inventories index rose to
45.1 percent from 43.3 percent in August.
   ``Manufacturing related to exports, particularly capital goods
and capital goods spending and equipment were strong, while the
automobile sector and related areas remained soft,'' Sinai said.
``The report is reflecting this mixture of pluses and minuses.''
   James Solloway, economist at Argus Research Corp., said that
given the likely decline in car sales and corporate profitability
as well as other sectors, ``the report would seem to point to a
deepening weakness into October and probably into the end of the
year.''
   A slowdown in home construction would affect demand for lumber
and other building-related materials and equipment, Solloway said.
   ``I still wouldn't rule out recession starting toward the end of
the year,'' Solloway said. ``It's a minority view but one that can
still be argued.''
   Some economists said the data showed a more positive outlook.
   ``The manufacturing sector seems to be coming back a little,''
said Sinai. ``It is consistent with continuing strong growth in
exports and equipment spending.

<HEAD>Dollar Edges Higher In Quiet Trading</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: Precede LONDON BC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose in quiet trading Monday,
resisting continued intervention by central banks to weaken the
U.S. currency.
   Gold prices were mixed.
   ``Trading was dominated by profit-taking with central bank
intervention less effective,'' said Ronald Holzer, currency broker
with Harris Trust &amp; Savings Bank.
   The U.S. Federal Reserve and foreign central banks continued for
the second consecutive week to sell dollars in a concerted effort
to push the dollar lower.
   Last week the U.S. currency lost more than 4 percent of its
value against the West German mark and Japanese yen. The action has
followed a recent agreement by the Group of Seven industrialized
democracies that the dollar's recent rise was ``inconsistent with
longer run economic fundamentals.''
   The seven nations in the group are the United States, Britain,
Japan, France, West Germany, Italy and Canada.
   Currency analysts said many traders remained bullish and
repeatedly challenged the intervention.
   ``The underlying pro-dollar sentiment was coming back out of the
closet, and every time it came out the Fed came in and intervened
along with other central banks,'' said Robert A. Feldman, vice
president of Salomon Brothers Inc.
   In Tokyo, the dollar ended slightly lower at 139.30 Japanese yen
compared with 139.35 at Friday's close. In late London trading, the
dollar was at 139.25 yen. In New York, the dollar traded at 139.70

<HEAD>Cocoa Futures Touch 16-Year Low On Ivory Coast Concerns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Cocoa futures prices plunged to a 16-year low Monday on New
York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange on indications that more
cocoa from the Ivory Coast may be headed for an already
overburdened world market.
   On other commodity markets Monday, cotton futures rallied
strongly, grains and soybeans were sharply higher, most energy
futures fell, livestock and meat futures were mixed, and precious
metals were mixed.
   Cocoa settled $25 to $34 lower with the contract for delivery in
December at $1,008 per metric ton. The December contract traded as
low as $995 during the session, marking cocoa's first dip below
$1,000 since 1973. The close was also the lowest since 1973.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds.
   Analysts attributed much of the market's weakness to
confirmation that the Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa
producer, had slashed by 50 percent the support price it pays to
cocoa farmers.
   Arthur Stevenson, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc., said the price-support cut had been urged by international
lending agencies and could signal a more aggressive selling posture
on the part of the Ivory Coast.
   Meanwhile, rumors resurfaced that a 500,000-ton Ivorian cocoa
deal involving two trade houses had collapsed.
   ``It just means there is that much more cocoa to be sold,''
Stevenson said.
   Cotton futures soared on New York's Cotton Exchange, largely
reflecting bullish chart signals. Further buying was linked to
speculation that India's cotton crop may be smaller than forecast
and to position-evening by traders in a market that has fluctuated
wildly in recent weeks.
   ``A lot of people have been whipsawed by this market,'' said
analyst Judy Ganes of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   Corn futures prices soared on the Chicago Board of Trade amid
rumblings of a major Soviet purchase of U.S. corn, and the other
grain and soybean markets went along for the ride.
   Rumors that the Soviet Union had bought as much as 3 million
metric tons of corn over the weekend sent futures prices for corn
up the permitted daily limit of 10 cents a bushel shortly after the
opening.
   The other markets rose in sympathy with corn, but prices
retreated from their highs across the board in afternooon
profit-taking.
   Wheat futures settled unchanged to 4} cents higher with December
at $4.07\ a bushel; corn was 6 cents to 8{ cents higher with
December at $2.41{ a bushel; oats were 2} cents to 4\ cents higher
with December at $1.46} a bushel; soybeans were 4{ cents to 9 cents
higher with November at $5.77 a bushel.
   Energy futures finished mostly lower on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, led by a drop in near-term heating oil contracts that was
viewed as a technical correction following five days of steady
gains.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 5 cents to 12 cents
lower with November at $20.01 a barrel; heating oil was .30 cent to
.45 cent lower with November at 59.58 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was 1.42 cent lower to .05 cent lower with November at
56.80 cents a gallon.
   Live cattle futures dropped sharply on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange amid worries that cash prices would not follow through on
expectations for higher levels.
   Pork futures advanced moderately following Friday's quarterly
Agriculture Department hogs-and-pigs report, which showed
lower-than-expected hog-breeding intentions.
   Live cattle settled .05 cent to .90 cent lower with October at
71.15 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent to .60 cent lower
with October at 82.60 cents a pound; hogs were .30 cent lower to
.65 cent higher with October at 44.17 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .03 cent to .33 cent higher with February at 48.55
cents a pound.
   Precious metals finished nearly unchanged on New York's
Commodity Exchange.
   Gold was 20 cents lower to 40 cents higher with October at
$367.60 a troy ounce; silver was 0.6 cent to 1 cent lower with
December at $5.303 a troy ounce.

<TEXT>
   Oil futures prices fell Monday as a recent rally
inspired by a new OPEC production agreement ran out of steam.
   The November contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, slipped 12 cents to close at $20.01 per
42-gallon barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract
had gained 27 cents on Friday.
   Friday's advance was sparked by an agreement among the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries that raised the
ceiling on the cartel's overall output to 20.5 million barrels of
oil a day from the previous limit of 19.5 million barrels.
   Oil investors were encouraged by the group's ability to reach an
agreement to limit production.
   On Monday, though, many traders sold futures contracts to cash
in their profits and halted the rally, analysts said.
   ``There was a feeling the market was overbought'' on Friday,
said Mary Haskins, a vice president of energy futures trading at
Drexel Burham Lambert Inc.
   Home heating oil futures traded on the mercantile exchange also
declined. The November contract for heating oil, in its first day
of trading, fell 0.38 cent a gallon to close at 59.58 cents and
subsequent months also retreated.
   The November contract for gasoline, also in its initial trading
day, dropped 1.42 cents a gallon to 56.80 cents. Most subsequent
months also fell.

<HEAD>AMR Plane-Buying Spree Continues With $850 Million Airbus Deal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AMR Corp. announced another airplane purchase
Monday, a deal for six Airbus Industries jets and options for six
more, giving the parent of American Airlines firm orders for 248
jets with options for 302 more as it continues to expand what is
already the largest fleet in the non-Communist world.
   Neither company would reveal the cost of the deal, but previous
estimates have placed it above $850 million.
   The deal means that in the last 31 months, the Fort Worth-based
company has placed firm orders and options for more than $22
billion worth of planes for American, which last year became the
nation's largest carrier. In addition, its AMR Eagle commuter
airline has placed orders and options for another 250 jets valued
at about $1.45 billion.
   Meanwhile, AMR continued to be one of the most actively traded
issues on the New York Stock Exchange Monday as 1.6 million shares
changed hands and the price declined $1.12{ a share to close at
$85. The activity has been attributed to speculation involving a
possible takeover of the airline.
   AMR said it would use the six widebody A300-600Rs ordered Monday
to expand its Caribbean service, and return to domestic service
some of the DC-10s now flying those routes.
   Five of the jets, valued at about $71 million each, will be
delivered in 1991, with one the following year. AMR also has
options for six more of the jets to be delivered in 1992 and 1993.
The jets are powered by two General Electric CF6-80C2 engines.
   The planes, which meet the strictest noise requirements, are
designed to carry about 267 passengers, said David Venz, spokesman
for the French manufacturer.
   ``The point is that we are a growing and expanding airline
company with a great need for airplanes,'' AMR spokesman Al Becker
said. ``We are always looking for aircraft.
   Most of the planes purchased during the buying binge have been
intended for expansion and not replacement of older aircraft,
Becker said.
   American's fleet already numbers 485, and Becker said the
carrier plans to have 575 planes by 1994. That does not count the
options the airline holds for an additional 302 jets.
   ``Admittedly it's blue sky,'' Becker said, but American is in
position to have a 900-plane fleet by the end of the next decade.
   With Monday's order, American now has firm orders for 85 MD-80s
and eight MD-11s from McDonnell Douglas Corp.; 70 757-200s and 10
767-399ERs from Boeing Co.; and 75 Fokker 100s from the Dutch
manufacture.
   The airline also has options on 100 MD-80 and 42 MD-11s, 85
options split between the two Boeing aircraft and 75 options on the
Fokker 100s.

   The value of export orders booked by French arms

French Defense Ministry said Monday.
   The ministry said 53 percent of the total was accounted for by
orders for aeronautical equipment and 36 percent for land-based
defense equipment, while naval orders represented 11 percent.
   France's biggest customers remain the Middle East and North
Africa, together accounting for 55 percent of total orders. North

total, and South America for 14 percent.

   Motorola Inc. announced Monday a plan to
reduce its 105,000-employee workforce by some 2,500 people through
a program emphasizing what the electronics company called
``enhanced voluntary severance.''
   ``This is aimed primarily at salaried employees,'' said Motorola
spokesman Chuck Sengstock. ``We've improved our normal voluntary
severance package. Those applying who are accepted will now receive
two weeks' severance pay for each year of service.''
   The program, which is restricted primarily to Motorola's U.S.
operations, goes into effect immediately, Sengstock said. He said
most of those being urged to take the severance package work in the
company's communications and semiconductor products groups.
   ``If we do not have enough people volunteering for severance,
some involuntary severances may occur, but we won't know about that
for at least six weeks,'' said Sengstock. ``We're hoping we can
meet our goals through voluntary severance, normal attrition and
internal business transfers.''
   The company said a pretax provision of approximately $43 million
to cover the cost of the severance would be reflected in
third-quarter earnings to be announced next week.
   ``We retain our confidence in the company's growth prospects,''
said company president George Fisher. ``This program simply
reflects what we at Motorola consider to be good and prudent
management and provides a means for us to reduce our cost base
through a voluntary process which is in the best interest of our
employees.''
   The package will be offered to workers at selected Motorola
facilities until approximately mid-November, Sengstock said. He
mentioned plants in Chicago; Phoenix; Austin, Texas; Fort Worth,
Texas; Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; and Boynton Beach, Fla., as among the
facilities where salaried employees would be encouraged to take
severance.
   Motorola, headquartered in this Chicago suburb, has plants or
other facilities at some 24 locations in the United States,
Sengstock said.

<HEAD>Boston Bank Announces It Will Take a Loss to Cover Shaky Loans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bank of Boston Corp., expressing concern about the
economy, announced Monday it was diverting $370 million from its
earnings to increase its reserve for possible loan losses.
   Ira Stepanian, chairman and chief executive officer, said based
on current estimates, Bank of Boston will have a third-quarter loss
of approximately $125 million after placing the money in its
reserve for credit losses.
   But he said Bank of Boston should end the first nine months of
1989 with a profit.
   ``It's a good deal of money,'' said bank spokesman Wayne Taylor.
``It's certainly a big hit for us.''
   In a separate matter, Stepanian said the bank has taken steps to
strengthen its internal controls, real estate lending and review of
credit risk, as suggested by federal regulators after a review by
the office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
   ``The issues raised by the regulators are ones we take very
seriously,'' Stepanian said in a prepared statement.
   On the new reserve, Stepanian said the bank was taking a
leadership position similar to 1987, when it shifted money to cover
loans to Third World countries.
   Among the reasons he cited for Monday's action were continued
weakness in the real estate industry and ``further signs of
softness in general economic conditions.'' The bank already had 100
percent reserves against its non-trade-related lending to Third
World countries.
   Also, Taylor said, one of the bank's business customers assumed
a large amount of debt for a transaction, and now the bank is
concerned that the company might have trouble paying off the loan.
   He declined to name the company or the amount of the loan.
   By shifting money into the reserve account, ``it doesn't just
forgive the debt,'' Taylor said.
   ``We're taking it off the books so it doesn't just hang there,''
he said, adding that the bank would still try to recover the money.
   The additional reserve, combined with $70 million in charge-offs
for bad loans in the quarter, brings the total reserve to about
$945 million, or 3.5 percent of total loans and leases.
   Stepanian said the bank expects to enter an agreement with the
federal agency in which the board of directors will review steps to
improve its performance in those areas cited in the governmental
review.

   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. will retain its New
York headquarters at least until 2004 but with about half the space
currently occupied, under terms of a renegotiated lease announced
Monday by the investment banking firm that recently settled
widespread fraud charges.
   Drexel said it had reached agreement with landlord Olympia &amp;
York, a large real estate concern that owns many New York
properties, to restructure and extend for 10 years Drexel's lease
on its world headquarters in southern Manhattan. The lease had been
due to expire in about four years.
   Within two years Drexel expects to consolidate most of its New
York-based operations into 700,000 square feet in one building, vs.
1.5 million square feet in four locations now, the firm said.
   Financial details of the restructured lease weren't disclosed,
but Drexel said in a statement it will ``result in a substantial
cash savings over the next three and a half years.''
   Drexel was once the fifth-biggest Wall Street firm but underwent
a drastic restructuring earlier this year, after agreeing to settle
securities fraud charges that stemmed from a prolonged federal
investigation.
   As part of the settlement, Drexel pleaded guilty to six felonies
and paid more than $650 million in fines, penalties and interest.
   The firm eliminated its retail operations and terminated about
4,000 employees of its 9,300 workforce worldwide. The New York
staff was cut by 1,345 people to 3,635.

   Braniff Inc., using $49 one-way flights to lure
passengers, on Monday resumed about 20 percent of its 256-flight
network virtually shut down when the carrier filed its second
bankruptcy reorganization in seven years.
   Meanwhile, the list of creditors against the cash-squeezed
airline continued to grow as laid-off union workers prepared
petitions for back wages and benefits.
   Braniff, which has lost nearly $1.6 million a week this year,
filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Thursday and announced
plans to cut its work force to about 2,000 from 4,791. Officials at
the Orlando-based carrier say they plan to reorganize as a smaller
airline.
   On Friday, Braniff operated four flights linking its Kansas
City, Mo., hub with Dallas and Orlando. Eight flights were run
daily on the weekend using 160-seat Boeing 727 aircraft, and 46
flights were scheduled for Monday.
   Braniff spokeswoman Sandy Smith said the most crowded weekend
flight was Sunday from Los Angles to Kansas City, with about 73
percent of the seats filled. On Saturday, only 13 percent of seats
were occupied on a flight from Dallas-Fort Worth to Kansas City.
   From Kansas City, Braniff on Monday scheduled flights to and
from Chicago; Dallas-Fort Worth; Los Angeles; Newark, N.J.; New
York's La Guardia Airport; Phoenix; San Diego; San Francisco;
Washington, D.C.; and Orlando.
   From Orlando, round-trip flights were scheduled to Dallas and La
Guardia.
   Before the bankruptcy filing, Braniff flew to 39 U.S. cities and
Nassau, Bahamas.
   Ms. Smith said the carrier will not likely consider boosting
service until mid October. Braniff's $49 one-way fare ends
Wednesday, but $99 fares will be in effect until Oct. 31.
   Teamster officials Monday held meetings in Orlando for the more
than 1,800 laid-off Braniff union workers, said Teamster business
representative Bob Belans. Braniff employed about 2,250 Teamster
members, mostly customer service agents, clerical workers and other
support personnel.
   Belans said the meetings were called to instruct workers on how
to petition the bankruptcy court for back pay and benefits. The
airline withheld final paychecks to many laid-off workers.
   The Association of Flight Attendants, which represents 900
Braniff employees, plans to establish some type of relief effort
for laid-off members who need food, clothing and other assistance,
said union spokeswoman Ruth Hinsey in Orlando.
   ``We have the work force now to support the flights and I can't
speculate when we may need more,'' said Braniff spokesman Don
McGuire in Orlando.
   He said the company has set up a toll-free telephone number to
assist laid-off employees find job-training programs and other
resources.
   Braniff, acquired last year in a leveraged buyout by a group of
investors led by PaineWebber Inc., lost $31.8 million on revenue of
$293 million from February to July. The carrier's net worth _
assets minus debts _ declined from $33.6 million on Jan. 31, 1988,
to a negative $23 million July 31.
   Braniff International Corp. filed for bankruptcy in 1982,
shortly after industry deregulation, and emerged in 1984 as a
smaller carrier. It relocated its headquarters from Dallas to
Orlando in May.
   Braniff hopes to settle the $1.5 billion in claims from the
first bankruptcy filing by the end of the year.
   A hearing is scheduled for Oct. 20 before Bankruptcy Judge C.
Timothy Corcoran in Orlando on Braniff's $2 billion agreement to
acquire 50 Airbus A320 jets, McGuire said.

<TEXT>
   The man picked to head the Securities and
Exchange Commission believes he can fight to keep the nation's
stock markets honest, but that it's up to the industry to woo back
small investors.
   Richard C. Breeden, replying at length Monday to a series of
written questions from the senators who will vote on his
appointment, said restoring investor confidence in the wake of the
1987 crash and the insider trading scandals is a job for the
securities industry itself.
   ``Many Americans may also have a perception that self-interest
and corruption among securities industry participants are
widespread,'' said Breeden in the 109-page question-and-answer
sheet.
   ``The commission can help correct this perception through
vigorous enforcement, but much of this change must be accomplished
by the industry itself through renewed attention to retail
customers and dedication to ethical business practices.''
   Breeden also said that the head of the SEC does not have the
authority, on his own, to halt trading in the midst of a disaster
such as the 1987 crash _ and even if he did, ``I would not consider
such a step.''
   Breeden said that there's too much uncertainty about when the
markets would close and for how long.
   ``In a crisis, this uncertainty and the related rumors
concerning its likelihood could have seriously adverse
consequences.''
   Breeden, 37, a key White House aide, was nominated by President
Bush in August to succeed SEC Chairman David S. Ruder, who returned
to teaching law last week.
   The Senate has yet to confirm Breeden, the assistant to the
president for issue analysis and the chief White House liaison on
the recent savings and loan bailout bill.
   Breeden received a warm reception last month at his confirmation
hearing before the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs
Committee. A committee vote is expected later this month.
   In the meantime, SEC member Edward H. Fleischman has been tapped
as acting SEC chairman until the Breeden nomination is decided.
   Breeden said in the written response that he believes vigorous
enforcement of existing rules against insider trading and other
illegal activities is ``one of the most effective means to increase
individual investor confidence and participation.''
   He added that his experience with the S&amp;L restructuring ``has
largely confirmed my prior views rather than changing them'' about
``strict enforcement of safety and soundness standards.''
   On other topics Breeden said he:
   _Believed securities laws ``would benefit from modernization''
because ``current law often excessively restricts competition.''
   _Doesn't think the rival Commodity Futures Trading Commission
should have exclusive control over all ``hybrid'' financial
products that have some characteristics of securities and futures
contracts because it could ``stifle innovation.''
   _Favors breaking down the Glass-Steagall Act's barrier between
commerical banking and the securities industry ``but only if the
entire regulatory structure'' that would replace it ``was adequate
to protect the integrity of the securities markets.''

<HEAD>Honeywell Sells Its 50 Percent Stake In HNSX Supercomputers To NEC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Honeywell Inc. has sold to NEC Corp. of Japan
its 50 percent ownership in HNSX Supercomputers Inc., the
Massachusetts company that markets NEC supercomputers in the United
States and Canada.
   Terms of the agreement were not disclosed Monday.
   HNSX, based in Burlington, Mass., had been jointly owned by
Honeywell and NEC since its inception in 1986. Honeywell said the
venture is no longer within its ``strategic focus.''
   The Minneapolis-based controls maker and defense contractor lost
$435 million in fiscal 1988 and announced a sweeping restructuring
in July. Earlier Honeywell had sold its other computer operations.
   The HNSX deal puts NEC in complete control of its attack in the
U.S. against Minneapolis-based Cray Research.
   Cray is the world's largest supercomputer maker, but NEC threw
America's long-term dominance of the industry into question in
April when it announced it will introduce the world's fastest
supercomputer next year.
   Supercomputers are considered crucial to national security
because they are heavily used for designing nuclear weapons. They
also are used for such tasks as scientific research, oil
exploration and weather forecasting.
   The U.S. government has strongly discouraged federal agenies and
universities that receive government grants from buying
Japanese-made supercomputers.

<HEAD>Cray Announces 400 Layoffs at Two Plants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHIPPEWA FALLS, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cray Research Inc., one of the
world's largest supercomputer manufacturers, announced Monday it is
laying off 400 employees at two Wisconsin plants.
   The layoffs are due to a failure to meet sales projections and
the fact that fewer employees are needed to manufacture today's
supercomputer systems, the Minneapolis-based company said. Cray
said it has essentially completed the transition from the Cray X-MP
system to the more advanced Cray Y-MP product line.
   Cray has about 5,400 employees worldwide.
   ``We never have had a major layoff in our 17-year history,
largely because growth in market demand has more than made up for
efficiencies realized in the manufacturing process,'' John
Rollwagen, Cray chairman and chief executive officer, said in a
statement.
   ``Today, however, our rate of growth has slowed, and the
technical advances move as fast, if not faster, than before,'' he
said.
   The company said all costs associated with the manufacturing
work force reduction would be incurred in 1989, and are expected to
total about $3 million.
   Cray said it was eliminating 280 jobs at Chippewa Falls and 120
at its Rice Lake plant.
   The company offered full salary to the end of year for any
employees who left voluntarily at the end of the month. Any layoffs
will be based on seniority, Cray said.
   Workers who lose their jobs would also get $4,000 in education
grants, the company said.

<HEAD>Lockheed To Take $165 Million in Charges Against 3rd-Quarter Profits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CALABASAS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lockheed Corp. said Monday it would
take a charge of about $165 million against its third-quarter
profits because of overruns on fixed-price contracts.
   The writeoffs will result in an after-tax loss of about $35
million for the three months ended Sept. 31, Daniel N. Tellep,
Lockheed's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.
   The charges stem mainly from a subcontract for wing parts on the
C-17 transport that McDonnell Douglas Corp. is building for the Air
Force and a contract to modify 12 EP-3E patrol planes for the Navy.
   Also included in the charge are overruns on some smaller
fixed-price development contracts and certain other programs,
Lockheed said.
   Lockheed's initial cost figure was $1.3 billion for the C-17
wing work, and $59.8 million for the EP-3E modifications.
   Lockheed spokesman Bob Slayman said the company is continuing
efforts to persuade the government that Lockheed should be paid
more because hundreds of changes were made in design specifications
after the contracts were made.
   ``The assumption was these were build to (blue) print,'' he
said. ``But then there were many changes made in those prints.''
   Despite the expected third-quarter loss, Slayman said Lockheed
expected the year to be profitable as a whole.

<HEAD>Coal Strike Blamed for Profit Decline at CSX</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CSX Corp.'s third-quarter profit declined,
due in part to the United Mine Workers strike against Pittston Coal
Group Inc., the Richmond-based railroad, barge and natural
resources company said Monday.
   CSX said third-quarter earnings totaled $94 million, or 91 cents
per share, compared with $120 million, or 75 cents a share, for the
same period last year. Revenue for the quarter totaled $1.9
billion, $1 million less than last year's third quarter.
   The disparity in the per-share earnings between the two quarters
reflects an ongoing share-repurchase program.
   In addition to lower coal traffic caused by the ongoing coal
strike, which began April 5, CSX cited an overall weakening of the
economy's industrial sector as well as service disruptions and
damage caused by Hurricane Hugo for its lower earnings.
   The company said earnings for the first nine months of 1989
totaled $327 million, or $3.10 per share, compared with earnings of
$25 million, or 11 cents a share, for the first nine months of
1988. Last year's results reflected a post-tax special charge of
$492 million, or $3.16 per share.
   Revenue for the first nine months was $5.7 billion, compared
with $5.5 billion for the same 1988 period.

<HEAD>Fidelity, Nintendo Announce Home Financial Trading System</HEAD>
<DATELINE>REDMOND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tomorrow's investors may have to battle
their 9-year-olds for control of the home Nintendo set under a plan
to add financial services to a system previously reserved for fun
and games.
   Fidelity Investments, Nintendo Co. Ltd. and Nintendo of America
announced Monday they would develop and build a system to deliver
financial services into American and Canadian homes via the
Nintendo Entertainment System.
   The financial services, which will be available in 1990, include
personal portfolio management, trading of securities and mutual
funds, and access to financial markets.
   Nintendo of America, based in Redmond, estimated 20 million
American homes will have Nintendo entertainment sets by the end of
this year. The company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Nintendo Co.
Ltd. of Kyoto, Japan.
   ``This is a critical step toward the evolution of the Nintendo
Entertainment System beyond traditional home video game play,''
said Jerry Ruttenbur, vice president at Nintendo of America.
   ``We think this will be a vital communication link in the
1990s,'' said Jack Chafin, senior vice president of Boston-based
Fidelity Investments. ``This project ... adds an entirely new
dimension to how consumers can access and use financial services.''
   The companies plan for Nintendo to develop and manufacture a
modem, or telephone hookup, and a controller, which will work with
the Nintendo home set to form part of a network delivering
entertainment and informational products.
   Fidelity will develop software cartridges for home securities
trading.
   Fidelity Investments manages more than $100 billion for its
mutual fund and brokerage customers. It is the nation's largest
privately held investment manager.

<HEAD>Belzbergs Seek Special Stockholders Meeting In Armstrong Takeover</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LANCASTER, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Canadian family considering a hostile
takeover of Armstrong World Industries Inc. has asked the board of
directors to allow a special stockholders meeting.
   Lancaster-based Armstrong, which manufactures interior
furnishings, said in a news release Monday it is examining the
request from the Belzberg family of Vancouver, British Columbia,
which has interests in real estate and a financial company.
   The family's petition asks the board to amend its articles of
incorporation to allow investors holding 20 percent of the
company's stock to call a special meeting.
   According to the petition, two companies controlled by the
Belzbergs own 4.56 million shares, or 9.85 percent of the company.
The shares were purchased for $181 million this summer.
   The petition, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, indicates the Belzbergs have not acquired any more
Armstrong stock since announcing their initial stake July 5.
   Under Pennsylvania law, only investors holding at least 10
percent of a company's stock can file amendment petitions. The
Belzbergs were joined in the action by United Funds Inc. and United
Vanguard Fund Inc., which together own nearly 800,000 shares.
   Armstrong's stock closed Monday at 44.62{, up $1.37{, on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   The petition also seeks to waive the Pennsylvania business
combination statute, which is intended to discourage takeovers.
   The Belzbergs asked the U.S. District Court in Philadelphia to
approve the petition's requests.
