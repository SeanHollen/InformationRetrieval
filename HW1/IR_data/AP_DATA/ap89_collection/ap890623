   The United Nations will now refer to Burma
as the Union of Myanmar in all official business, Burmese and U.N.
officials said Friday.
   It is the first nation to formally change its name in the world
body since the Ivory Coast became Cote d'Ivoire in 1986. In the
past, other nations have changed their names, including Upper Volta,
which became Burkina Faso.
   The change is primarily one of procedure and protocol, involving
little expense in the world body. The nation, which used to be
seated alphabetically in the front of the General Assembly chamber,
now will be seated in the middle along with other nations with names
beginning with ``M.''
   Name plates in various U.N. chambers will be changed from Burma
to Myanmar and seating will be changed accordingly, U.N. protocol
officials said. The flag will not be changed.
   The government recently decided to change the name to Myanmar to
reflect the actual usage in the region and not to refer to the
ethnic Burmese population alone.

   President Bush dispatched a team led by
Interior Secretary Manual Lujan and Environmental Protection Agency
William Reilly to inspect the oil spill off Rhode Island, the White
House said Friday night.
   Bush was briefed on the spill at 8 p.m. at the Camp David weekend
retreat by White House chief of staff John Sununu, said deputy press
secretary Steve Hart.
   ``He expressed his deep concern and asked to be kept informed,''
Hart said.
   The delegation will fly over the spill Saturday morning, Hart
said.
   Other members of the group include Rear Adm. Clyde T. Lusk. chief
of staff of the Coast Guard, and Elaine Chao, deputy transportation
secretary. The Transportation Department is the parent agency of the
Coast Guard.
   The Coast Guard assumed direction of the cleanup immediately for
the most rapid response, Hart said.
   Hart said officials on the scene had told the White House that as
many as 1.6 million gallons of No. 2 fuel oil could leak from four
penetrated tanks on the vessel. Reports from Rhode Island put the
spill at about 1 million gallons when the leak was stopped at about
9 p.m.
   Steve Goldstein, press spokesman for Lujan, said form his home
Friday night, ``There has been some impact on the shoreline.''

<HEAD>Court Says Death Row Inmates Don't Get Free Lawyers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Constitution doesn't require that states
provide free lawyers for inmates who are sentenced to death if the
prisoners have already lost a round of appeals, a divided Supreme
Court said Friday.
   The court ruled 5-4 to uphold Virginia officials who said forcing
states to pay for second-round appeals could lead to long delays in
executing inmates.
   When inmates file a first appeal in state courts, lawyers are
provided by the state.
   If that fails, inmates can pursue a second round of appeals. Like
other states, Virginia provides prison law libraries and assigns
part-time lawyers to help all inmates prepare their second-round _
or collateral _ appeals. In some cases, volunteer lawyers are
available.
   Death row inmates who lose a second time may then shift to
federal courts, but legal help in those appeals was not at issue in
Friday's case.
   In writing the majority opinion,, Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist said convicts' constitutional rights are not violated by
cutting off free access to lawyers.
   ``The additional safeguards imposed by the (Constitution) at the
trial stage of a capital case are, we think, sufficient to assure
the reliability of the process by which the death penality is
imposed,`` Rehnquist said.
   Rehnquist was joined by Justices Byron R. White, Sandra Day
O'Connor and Antonin Scalia.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy supplied the fifth vote to overturn a
federal appeals court ruling that said condemned killers in Virginia
who cannot afford a lawyer are entitled to greater representation at
taxpayer expense than the state provides.
   In a separate concurring opinion, Kennedy agreed with the result
reached by the other four but on narrower grounds.
   In a dissenting opinion, Justice John Paul Stevens said the
ruling violates ``simple fairness'' for death row inmates. He was
joined by Justices William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall and Harry
A. Blackmun.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled a year ago the
Constitution requires special legal help for death row appeals
because of their complexity.
   Twenty states joined in support of Virginia. They are Florida,
Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, Missouri, South Dakota,
Wyoming, Delaware, California, Pennsylvania, New Mexico, Indiana,
Kentucky, New Hampshire, Nevada, Utah, South Carolina, Oregon,
Maryland and Idaho.

   A routine traffic check turned into a drama on the
Boston waterfront Thursday as police officers and fire crews tried
in vain to rescue a police horse that fell through a hole in a pier.
   The horse, Fortrek, died from shock a few minutes after animal
rescuers pulled it from the water Thursday at the A.C. Cruise Line
pier at Harbor Park.
   Boston Police officer Edward Cahill left the horse tied to a
fence along the pier while he checked out a vehicle reported stolen
across the street. The horse's hind legs fell when asphalt gave way
on the pier and despite the efforts of Cahill and others, dropped 15
feet into the harbor.
   William Sweet, a bus driver for the Warpula Bus Co., said he had
parked his bus in a nearby parking lot and was walking towards the
bridge when he heard the horse struggling.
   ``I got the officer and by the time we got to the horse it was in
to its hips,'' said Sweet.
   Sweet said he and three pedestrians assisted Cahill in holding
the horse by its reins and saddle, then the horse ``started slipping
through the saddle.''
   Police officers, firefighters and rescue workers kept the horse's
head above water with secured ropes through the hole, while Cahill
and other officers tried to keep the horse calm below the pier.
   Eventually, two cranes were brought to the scene and the horse,
struggling wildly, was hoisted back onto the pier. Minutes later,
however, it died of shock and trauma from the fall.
   Dr. Edward Leonard of the Animal Rescue League said Fortrek may
have severely injured his back because the horse could not control
its legs as it was lowered to the ground.
   The brown, 18-year-old Fortrek had been assigned to Cahill for
the last six months.

<TEXT>
   Ailing former Gov. Dan Walker was released from
federal prison in Minnesota on Thursday after serving 17 months of a
seven-year sentence for financial fraud, his lawyer said.
   U.S. District Judge Ann Williams ordered Walker's release
Wednesday. A defense motion for reduction of his sentence said he
was ``frail and chronically ill,'' as well as ``financially
destitute,'' said a clerk in Williams' office.
   The former governor, 66, was surprised and pleased by the
decision, said Walker's lawyer, Thomas Foran. But he added that
Walker would have been ``eligible for parole 10 months down the road
anyway.''
   Foran did not know Walker's future plans but said the
ex-politician was considering a move to Virginia.
   ``He's got a brother there who is a retired Navy captain who has
a successful business,'' Foran said. ``They're close.''
   Walker, a Democrat who was governor from 1973 to 1977, pleaded
guilty in August 1987 to financial fraud for using his Oak Brook
savings and loan as a personal treasury to obtain $280,000 in loans.
   Government prosecutors said Walker used the loans to pay expenses
for other businesses and personal debts. Walker had been involved in
an unsuccessful chain of quick-oil-change garages.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas Durkin said Walker still must
serve five years on probation after his release from the prison in
Duluth.
   Walker has hypertension, emphysema and back problems, and lost 13
pounds while in prison, according to court documents filed on his
behalf. The documents also say he cooperated with government
investigators.
   Walker achieved national prominence when he was elected governor
for overcoming the political machine of the late Richard J. Daley,
which had backed then-Lt. Gov. Paul Simon, now a member of the U.S.
Senate, in the Democratic primary.

   Containers of two toxic and potentially
explosive chemicals overturned while being loaded on trucks
Thursday, forcing President Bush to change his route out of New York
City.
   Six hours later, workers in special impervious suits found all
the drums and boxes in the shipping containers intact and the
emergency was declared over.
   The president was delayed by about half an hour in flying back to
Andrews Air Force Force Base near Washington because his plane had
to be flown from Newark International Airport, adjacent to the
mishap area at Port Elizabeth, to John F. Kennedy International
Airport in the borough of Queens in New York, about 25 miles away.
   The president delayed the departure of his motorcade from a New
York banquet to permit Secret Service officials and police to plot
the route to Kennedy.
   Bush had spent the day in New York, winding up at a Republican
fund-raiser.
   Because of the potential hazards, ``We have been advised to move
Air Force One and the press plane to another location,'' White House
press secretary Marlin Fitzwater told reporters in New York.
   Security was extremely heavy, with at least 80 New York City
police and Port Authority vehicles converging on the hangar at
Kennedy where Air Force One was briefly parked.
   The presidential jet took off from a runway shrouded in fog.
   Richard Fulton, a spokesman for the state Department of
Environmental Protection, said the two containers of sodium nitrate
and allyl isothiocyanate _ ``mixed together, extremely explosive'' _
were being taken off a ship from Europe at the SeaLand Terminal when
the overturned.
   The president and Mrs. Bush had flown to Newark on Air Force One
Thursday morning for a day-long visit to New York City. They visited
a shelter for runaway youth and the president, in a speech before a
civic group, called for a crusade to spur volunteerism.

   Robert Hornbeck aimed his truck up the
winding mountain road and eyed the aged forest looming above.
   ``There is your pristine old-growth forest,'' said the logger,
pointing to silver shafts of dead and dying trees within the green
shag of hemlock, fir and lighter-colored cedar. ``To me, it's not
beauty. It's a little bit pathetic. It's a forest that's overripe.
   ``It would have been logged by now, but it was pulled from the
market because of the spotted owl, and I don't think it will ever be
logged now. If they take it away, it's a way of life that is gone,
not just jobs.''
   Whether, when, and where cutting may resume in many Northwestern
national forests won't be known until U.S. District Judge William
Dwyer in Seattle decides whether to alter a March injunction
temporarily halting the sale of 1 billion board feet of timber in
Oregon and Washington.
   Dwyer's ruling came in a lawsuit challenging a Forest Service
plan to set aside 374,000 acres as habitat for the Northern spotted
owl. Environmentalists charged that the plan fails to set aside
enough old-growth forest to ensure the owls' survival; Dwyer's
injunction expands the affected acreage.
   Meanwhile, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife _ which refused in 1987 to
list the spotted owl as a threatened species _ reversed itself in
March and decided the bird's dwindling habitat warrants giving it
that status, a year-long process.
   Oregon Gov. Neil Goldschmidt and state congressional leaders have
called a summit meeting Saturday in Salem to try to resolve
conflicts over the owl. The governor, the state's entire
congressional delegation and representatives of government agencies
and timber and environmental groups will attend.
   The prospect that the owl will be listed as a threatened species
has added more doubt to the future of timber supplies.
   But there is much more at stake than board feet of lumber and a
subspecies of spotted owls, said forest ecologist Peter Morrison of
The Wilderness Society's Seattle office, who insists, ``I'm no tree
hugger.''
   ``We need to consider long-term impacts on biological
diversity,'' said Morrison, noting that relatively little is known
about virgin forests and interactions between plants and animals in
them.
   ``I can see serious impacts if we give up that biological
diversity found in an ancient forest, and by then it will be too
late. ... It's not going to be just the spotted owl disappearing.''
   The unique attachment of the owl to old growth is what put the
bird in the middle of controversy. Biologists say that while the owl
can use other forest land, it requires a certain amount of old
growth for nesting and mating. If that old growth is too fragmented,
the owl could spend so much time seeking food and shelter that it
wouldn't have time or energy to mate.
   The Forest Service doesn't know how much old growth is left, but
The Wilderness Society has estimated that less than 15 percent of
the original old-growth forest remains in the owl's range from
northern California to southern British Columbia. What is left is so
badly fragmented that much of it is worthless as habitat for the owl
and other wildlife.
   ``People want to say, `Let's sit down at a table and reasonably
talk about this dividing of a loaf,' when in reality the loaf is all
gone. What we are doing is squabbling over the crumbs,'' said Rick
Brown, a former Mount Hood National Forest biologist now working for
the National Wildlife Federation.
   But Ted Anderson, executive director of FFACTS, a group in
Washington's Skagit Valley organized this spring to defend the
timber industry, said it's the livelihood of workers and their
families that's at stake.
   National parks, wilderness areas, wild and scenic rivers and
other set-asides have removed 53 percent of the federal forest lands
in Washington from the timber base, he said. ``We simply can't write
off our industry.''
   For example, six timber sales in the Mount Baker District
covering half of the 2,200 acres set aside for one pair of spotted
owls would have produced 47 million board feet of timber to keep
local mills running for the next year.
   ``To us, that's our life,'' said Anderson. ``To them, it's for
one owl.''
   Andy Kerr, conservation director of the Oregon Natural Resources
Council, said timber jobs are going, owl or no owl. He cited a study
by The Wilderness Society estimating that the 71,500 timber jobs in
Washington and Oregon in 1985 will shrink to half that by 2030
mainly because of increased mill productivity. Stopping the harvest
of old growth altogether would eliminate only 6 percent of the
timber and 2,300 extra jobs in that period, the study said.
   Chuck Sisco of the National Audubon Society, another Forest
Service veteran, said the agency has bungled the works since 1978,
when it picked the owl as the indicator species for the well-being
of the old-growth ecosystem under provisions of the National Forest
Management Act.
   About two-thirds of the sites the Forest Service identified in
Oregon and Washington as owl habitats would affect lumbering, but
``their own data showed that 65 or 70 percent of the areas they said
were spotted owl sites in wilderness (where logging is prohibited)
didn't have any birds in them,'' Sisco said.
   On the west side of the Olympics, Larry Mason, owner of the Mason
Lumber mill in Beaver, reiterated the doubts held by many in the
timber industry that the spotted owl is threatened. Even if the
owl's days are numbered, he said, it is not responsible to shut
timber supplies down overnight.
   Mason complained that the fight over the owl vividly illustrates
the growing urban-rural separation in Washington, where the
Seattle-area economy has been fueled by a growing aerospace industry
and computer-age businesses while the traditional forest industry
has been pushed aside.
   ``You know,'' he said, ``There are people who have to get their
hands dirty every day earning a living, and there are city people
who think the forests should be their private playgrounds.''

   The 15-foot cross made of old-growth timber
stands across from Jerry Leppell's saw shop, where it was hewn.
   A half-dozen plastic owls are nailed to the crossbeam with a sign
that says: ``Here lie the hopes and dreams of our children.''
   The residents of this Olympic Peninsula logging town say they are
being crucified by environmentalists and the government, which have
closed, at least temporarily, thousands of acres of timber to
preserve old-growth forest and one of its elusive denizens, the
Northern spotted owl.
   ``Every way you turn, the government, the preservationists, big
business, they all want your job,'' said Garth Leavitt, a log
hauler. ``What do they want us to do? Move to the cities where
there's no work and no place to live?''
   Forks _ an isolated town of 3,000 on the western edge of the
Olympic National Park, 150 miles from Seattle _ sits in a broad
valley surrounded by bare green hills that still bear scars of what
modern loggers contemptuously call ``cut-and-run boys'' who took the
timber but didn't bother to replant.
   Logging trucks roar down a main street of gas stations and small
stores. Neighborhoods are dotted with swingsets, lush gardens and
yards decorated with rusting saws and other logging tools. The air
carries the peaceful aroma of burning cedar chips from nearby shake
mills.
   But like timber towns across the Northwest, Forks isn't peaceful.
   Yellow ``solidarity'' ribbons flutter on fenceposts and pickup
truck aerials from Forks to Oregon's Willamette Valley, where a
Eugene man is selling hundreds of T-shirts that read, ``Save a
logger, eat an owl.''
   Organized by the timber companies, labor unions and local
governments, millworkers and their families are turning out in
massive demonstrations. About 1,500 participated in a log truck
parade in the Columbia Gorge town of Hood River, Ore. More than
1,000 rallied at the Oregon Capitol.
   The pain from the shutdown of federal timber sales ``really
hasn't hit yet. There's still timber in the pipeline from sales
before this thing got going,'' said Mayor Warren Paul, adding that
it probably will hit just before winter.
   But Forks merchants say people already are pinching pennies, and
houses are going up for sale as loggers leave for Alaska's Tongass
National Forest.
   ``We have a house payment, and a new truck and stuff,'' said
Renee Robinson, a waitress and part of a third-generation logging
family. ``We don't know what's going to happen. A lot of people are
going to Alaska.
   ``We're all scared.''
   At the mental health center serving Forks and Clallam County,
director Steve Ironhill said the area already has the highest
suicide rate in the state and an alcoholism rate among the top 10
percent of U.S. counties. The pending economic disaster ``is going
to be the thing that is going to turn the community upside down.''
   Ironhill, a psychologist, said he hears the fear from children he
and his staff treat for abuse and other problems. ``I'm hearing them
say: `The spotted owl won't let my daddy work,' or `Daddy isn't
working,' or `Daddy went to Alaska.'''

   An American relief worker was apparently
kidnapped Thursday in Israel's occupied Gaza Strip, U.S. officials
said.
   The worker was identified as Chris George, 37, of the Save the
Children Federation. It was believed to be the first kidnapping of a
non-Israeli in Israel or its occupied territories.
   ``As far as we know he was taken today,'' a U.S. official who
spoke on condition of anonymity said late Thursday. ``We're not sure
by whom.'`
   The official said George apparently was kidnapped at about noon
Thursday local time in the Gaza area, although the exact location
was unknown.
   ``We've been in touch with local authorities on that, and both
the secretary of state and the president have been fully briefed on
this,'' the official said.
   He would not say whether officials have received any
communication or ransom demand.
   The Save the Children Federation Inc., based in Westport, Conn.,
is a private international development and relief organization that
employs over 3,000 employees in 40 countries.
   Federation spokeswoman Betty Woodward, reached by telephone in
Des Moines, Iowa, said she had no information on the matter. She
confirmed that George is an employee of the federation, but said she
did not have more information about him.

<TEXT>
   Not far from the site of Indiana Jones'
final triumph, bedouins hawk ancient coins and pottery chips, fake
Roman oil lamps and three-minute rides on a grunting camel.
   There's nary a sign of the cinematic swashbuckler _ not even a
bullwhip or souvenir fedora.
   ``Nobody knows nothing about Indiana Jones,'' says Mohammed
Ibraheem Al-Hasanat, a guide to the 2,000-year-old ruins of Petra,
where the climax of ``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'' was
filmed with Harrison Ford and Sean Connery.
   Bedouin boys who guide tourists on horseback to the site shrug
their shoulders and look puzzled at the mention of the movie.
   Petra, once the heart of a great trading empire, is not the sort
of place where first-run films play.
   Tens of thousands of tourists annually visit the remote mountain
valleys, shaped and tinted like melting scoops of multicolored ice
cream, to see Petra's eerie classical monuments.
   The makers of ``Last Crusade'' chose Petra's most famed edifice,
the 140-foot-tall Treasury, as the facade for the encounter by the
fictional archaeologist with the Holy Grail, the cup used by Jesus
Christ at the Last Supper.
   Local bedouins once sought lesser treasures from the monument,
probably hewn from its reddish rock slab a few years before Jesus
walked the streets of Jerusalem 100 miles to the north.
   A carved cylinder resembling a chess piece atop the monument is
scarred by the gunshots of those who tried to break it open,
believing ancient men had left riches inside.
   ``Nobody knows if there is any treasure or not,'' another guide,
Mohammed Al-Ashram, said as he pointed to the bullet marks. ``The
people have heard about this (legend) for maybe 10 generations.''
   Most of the bedouin seek their gold from the tourists _ offering
horseback rides, homebrewed tea, lukewarm soda pop and minor
antiquities to the visitors.
   Almost 1,000 yards from the Treasury, real archaeologists from
the University of Utah are at work on excavations.
   Digging through a temple dating from the time of Christ, they
hope to find more clues to the life of the Nabateans, the Arabian
people who built Petra and ruled a kingdom just beyond Rome's domain.
   The sprawl of their capital is evident from the High Place of
Sacrifice, an altar to pagan gods complete with a runoff channel for
blood.
   The dizzying rock summit overlooks miles of canyons and hillsides
carved with the distinctive Nabatean monuments and even earlier
Edomite remains.
   From a peak at Petra, the Bible says, the Hebrew chieftain
Amaziah hurled 10,000 Edomites to their death.
   On another summit nearby, the biblical prophet Aaron died. The
village just outside Petra, Wadi Mousa, is where locals believe
Moses struck a rock and made water run.
   Real crusaders in the Middle Ages left their mark as well in two
small castles meant to help protect the Kingdom of Jerusalem.
   A few miles north of Petra, archaeologists have discovered the
9,000-year-old village of Beidha, among the oldest settlements ever
excavated.
   With so much history scattered across the rocks, many of the
workers and residents at Petra seemed blase about the arrival and
departure of a screen star.
   At the Petra Resthouse bar, built into a Nabatean tomb, bartender
Mifleh Zoubi waved his hand when asked about the movie.
   ``Indiana Jones?'' he said. ``Joan Collins is better.''

   Protest and unrest were everywhere 20 years ago,
with civil rights, women's rights and anti-war demonstrators
regularly taking to the streets to cry their causes.
   But police arriving at an unlicensed Greenwich Village bar for a
routine raid on the muggy Friday night of June 27, 1969, had no
reason to expect trouble from homosexual patrons long accustomed to
sporadic harassment.
   Certainly no one, least of all the participants, expected a riot
that would launch a movement.
   ``For the gay and lesbian movement, that was our shot heard
'round the world,'' said Craig Rodwell, whose gay bookstore, the
Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookshop, has been operating in the Village for
22 years.
   ``There was nothing organized about it at all,'' said Edmund V.
White, who was at the Stonewall Inn when the raid began. ``For the
first time, people, instead of running away, decided to fight back.''
   The crowd hurled coins, bottles and rocks, anything at hand; they
set wastebaskets ablaze and threw them into the bar's doorway, said
White, a novelist.
   The next night, people gathered again outside the shuttered
Stonewall. The police had a riot control unit in the area, but White
said the night had ``a carnival atmosphere.''
   ``We were turning over cars,'' he said. ``We were quite crazy.''
   For most of those involved, ``it was just a night of great
excitement that did not necessarily propel them out of the closet,''
said Michael Scherker, who is preparing an oral history of the
Stonewall riots.
   But many others were propelled into political activity that
continues today. Opinion polls generally track a growing rate of
acceptance of gay men and lesbians among heterosexual Americans,
particularly in the cities, and laws barring discrimination on the
basis of sexual preference are on the books in dozens of U.S.
municipalities.
   ``The sense of rebellion and pride that Stonewall inspired is a
real factor in the number of openly gay people that you see today,''
said Urvashi Vaid, executive director of the National Gay and
Lesbian Task Force in Washington, D.C. ``It was not a sentiment
which existed in the '50s.''
   In June 1970, one year after Stonewall, about 3,000 people
marched up Manhattan's Sixth Avenue, and the idea spread to cities
across the country.
   In New York, a month of events ranging from art shows to panel
discussions culminates this weekend. Some 30,000 people are expected
at a rally in Central Park on Saturday, according to organizers, and
Sunday's parade down Fifth Avenue is expected to be the largest
ever, with more than 400,000 marching or watching.
   March organizers in San Francisco, which has a sizable gay
population, expect at least a quarter-million participants Sunday.
   The marches and celebrations this month have special significance
because of the 20th Stonewall anniversary and because of the urgency
of AIDS, the disease that has claimed thousands of gay lives.
   The epidemic has forced homosexuals to put traditional social
goals on hold in the 1980s as many in the community focused on
caring for the sick and demanding help from researchers and the
government.
   ``I think AIDS has sort of put a human face on gay people,'' said
Neil Miller, author of ``In Search of Gay America.'' ``I think that
that has broken down prejudice.''
   It also ``has ironically helped to bring a lot of people into
activism who might not have been so visible or so vocal,'' said
Larry Kramer, whose acclaimed play, ``The Normal Heart,'' attacked
society's slow response to the epidemic.
   But Vaid said the support gays have won in the AIDS fight ``does
not mean we have greater support for non-AIDS-related issues.''
   She cited the federal gay rights bill, which has been introduced
in Congress every year since 1975 and ``literally gone nowhere.''
   The task force has managed to gather only eight Senate and 70
House co-sponsors. ``That's an indication of how far we still have
to go,'' she said.
   ``In the first 10 years, we did not have an organized
opposition,'' Vaid said. ``In last 10 years we have had one _ the
fundamentalist right. That has contributed more than anything to
negative attitudes toward gay people.''
   Vaid says the work of the future should be directed toward
``getting recognition for our families and our relationships,'' such
as that provided by San Francisco's recently enacted domestic
partners law.
   That will rquire grass roots organizing at the state and local
level and a willingness by more gay men and lesbians to join the
effort, activists say.
   ``Twenty years ago, it was such a complete taboo to even talk
about homosexuality,'' Miller said.
   In another 20 years, Rodwell said hopefully, whether a person is
homosexual or heterosexual ``simply won't matter.''

   In a storefront in Arab east Jerusalem, Israeli
volunteers have set up a hot line to field Palestinian complaints of
misconduct by soldiers, settlers and police.
   ``We try to enforce the democratic principle that the authorities
are accountable to the citizens,'' said Tsilli Goldenberg, a former
antiques dealer who now works at the Hot Line for Victims of
Violence.
   The spare desk-and-telephone operation in a former men's clothing
store is one of more than 40 volunteer organizations created in
response to the Palestinian uprising.
   At least 528 Arabs and 23 Israelis have been killed since the
revolt against Israeli rule of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip
began 18{ months ago.
   In the past year, 731 complaints were filed with the hot line,
which can all on 70 volunteers and is financed in part by a grant
from the U.S.-based New Israel Fund, Goldenberg said.
   Complaints range from a claim that Jewish settlers sprayed
vineyards with toxic chemicals to a report that soldiers contributed
to the death of a Palestinian by delaying an ambulance at a
roadblock.
   Aliza Herman, 28, a Chicago-born civil rights lawyer, said some
Palestinians turn to the hot line when they are afraid to file
complaints with the police or face bureaucratic obstacles.
   ``Many times doors are closed to people from the occupied
territories and they can't get past a guard who tells them to go
home,'' she said. ``As Israelis, we know how to get things done.''
   In one recent case, a hot line inquiry resulted in two border
police officers being disciplined for harassing a Palestinian social
worker. He was detained and beaten when he questioned an order to
clean up the scene of a protest while on his way to work.
   Getting the army to respond to queries about the location of Arab
detainees or the behavior of soldiers is more difficult.
   ``Some of investigators respect us,'' Herman said. ``Some don't
speak to us. Generally, we don't get a bad reaction. More often we
are just ignored.''
   Most of the volunteer groups are leftist-oriented.
   The Israel Information Center For Human Rights was founded by
parliament member Dedi Zucker of the liberal Citizens' Rights
Movement. It is partly funded by a U.S. Ford Foundation grant and
compiles statistics on human rights violations and social trends in
the occupied lands.
   Director Zahava Galon said three psychologists are studying the
impact of collective punishment such as house demolitions. The
center estimates that 700 houses have been destroyed since the
uprising began, many as a punishment for the political activities of
one family member.
   ``They are studying how this affects the dignity and self-respect
of the victims, and how this will affect their ability to function
in the future,'' Galon said.
   She said that despite the volunteer work on behalf of
Palestinians, Israeli society generally is apathetic about the
uprising and has not been moved to the kind of protests that helped
end the three-year occupation of Lebanon in 1985.
   ``This is not a clear-cut case like Lebanon,'' Galon said. ``Most
people don't feel Israel is absolutely wrong. They feel threatened
and see the intefadeh (uprising) as a threat to their existence.
They tend to be more emotional than logical.''
   Other activists noted that Israel has not paid the same price as
in Lebanon, where more than 700 soldiers were killed and the army
spent billions of dollars.
   The army also has created a volunteer group _ a team of 20 people
who have subpoena powers to investigate cases in which army
discipline appeared to break down. Most of the volunteers are
lawyers with combat experience as soldiers.
   Col. Haim Adini, head of the unit and a veteran of three wars,
said he volunteered because he believed the army was at a critical
juncture and could not afford to duck accusations of misconduct.
   ``You can't sweep these problems under the carpet,'' the
53-year-old Adini, also a lawyer, said in an interview. ``If we lose
discipline, we lose the army.''
   The volunteers believe they can work more freely than regular
army investigators because they do not have promotion worries or
fears about damaging friendships.
   So far, the unit has started work on 20 cases in which soldiers
are accused of misconduct. Adini said that in some cases officers
tried to cover up for their men, either to preserve morale or
personal ties.
   In one case, Adini said, soldiers were not justified in beating
four Arabs in a refugee camp near Jericho. ``They overreacted, and
could have handled the situation in a softer way,'' he said. He
declined to say whether he had recommended prosecution.
   ``We are not covering up. We are dealing with the cases seriously
and objectively,'' Adinia said. ``In other countries, you don't find
such openness at a time of such pressure on the army.''

<HEAD>Cesar Romero Thinks `Batman' Is a Joke</HEAD>

   Hollywood's new gothic
action-thriller ``Batman'' is nothing like the campy television
series of the 1960s, and Batman's old TV nemesis found nothing to
laugh about in the new Joker.
   ``This just hit me the wrong way,'' said Cesar Romero, the former
Joker, played in the movie by Jack Nicholson. ``This picture is
dreary. The violence in it _ good God!''
   The new ``Batman'' opens in 2,100 North American theaters
tonight, poised like the dark avenger himself to make a killing at
the box office.
   Amid a summer slate of movie blockbusters already shining like
gold for major studios, the Gotham world of ``Batman'' glowers in
its grim portrayal of primeval violence and urban corruption.
   ``This is a very serious, heavy crime drama,'' said Romero, a
robust 82-year-old who just finished filming a cops and robbers
movie in Pittsburgh called ``Simple Justice.'' Romero attended a
media screening of ``Batman'' Wednesday night at the invitation of
The Associated Press.
   ``It's not the Batman concept at all,'' Romero lamented. ``And
Nicholson, who is such a wonderful actor and who has done such good
work, is just so violent.
   ``What we did was fun. It wasn't played that way. It was a spoof.
It was fun. It was a comic strip.''
   Still, Romero added, ``The picture will probably make a bloody
fortune.''
   Indeed, entertainment industry insiders predict that ``Batman''
may gross more than $30 million in its opening weekend.
   The ``Batman'' Romero remembered was as much a reflection of its
time as pop art and sunflower stickers on Volkswagens. It was silly
burlesque, with Adam West's wooden Batman squaring off against a
new, less-than-fiendish villain each week.
   And the villains were hardly theatrical slouches. There was
Vincent Price, Burgess Meredith, Tallulah Bankhead, Roddy McDowall
and Frank Gorshin.
   ``Everybody wanted to be a villain in Batman, it was sort of
`the' thing to do,'' Romero recalled.
   ``Batman's'' popularity mushroomed after the series began in
1966, but the slapstick wore out with all the countless ``KA-POWS!''
and ``SPLATS.'' By 1968 the show was dead.
   ``I thoroughly enjoyed playing the part, playing the Joker,''
said Romero, whose film career began in 1934, and who appeared as
the Cisco Kid in a series of 20th Century Fox movies, beginning in
1939.
   During the 1940s and '50s, Romero often appeared as a tall, dark
Latin lover and later was cast in roles requiring a suave character.
   Romero joined the TV show at the invitation of the producer,
William Dozier, who showed him a proposed script for an episode with
the Joker and a film of the first episode, featuring the Riddler.
   ``It was great,'' Romero said. ``But why he wanted me, I'll never
know.''
   Casting against type also is evident in the new film, with the
slight Michael Keaton playing the hulking, 6-foot caped menace who
is more obsessed with avenging his parents' death at the hands of
hoodlums than in truth, justice and the American way.
   Keaton ``plays a very subdued character,'' Romero said. ``The
Joker naturally has to be the flamboyant one.''
   To say that Nicholson's Joker is flamboyant is to say that his ax
murderer in ``The Shining'' was neighborly or that the actor's
devilish address to a congregation in the ``The Witches of
Eastwick'' was prim.
   But for Romero, Nicholson's Joker was too evil, too revolting and
the film was all too dismal and bewildering.
   ``In fact, I don't understand what this `Batmania' is all
about,'' he said.

   Known for his crooning cowboy tunes,
singer-songwriter Willie Nelson has turned his fondness for the
American Wild West into a broadcasting network he can call his own.
   The Cowboy Television Network, which Nelson developed with Austin
entrepreneur Edward Yi, will air movies, series, music videos, live
music shows, specials, and historical vignettes in the United States
and several other countries.
   The network's 24-hour programming, to start in late summer or
early fall, will be designed by Nelson and associate Mack Long,
according to a news release Thursday from Nelson and Yi.
   Yi, chairman and chief executive of Sunin International, created
a sister network, the Asian Broadcasting System, to air American
programs in Korea, Japan, China, the Philippines, Taiwan and other
nations in Southeast Asia.
   The networks will be located at Nelson's ranch in Willie, about
30 miles outside Austin.

   U.S. Rep. Morris K. Udall, D-Ariz., plans to marry
former congressional staffer Norma Gilbert this summer.
   No wedding date has been set, Dan O'Neill, Udall's district
assistant in Tucson, said Thursday.
   O'Neill said Ms. Gilbert is a California native who now lives in
the Washington area. He said she worked as a lobbyist before working
for a subcommittee of the House Interior Committee. Udall chairs the
full committee.
   The marriage will be Udall's third. He and his first wife
divorced and his second wife, Ella, committed suicide last August at
the couple's Washington-area home.
   O'Neill said he did not know Ms. Gilbert's age, her employer as a
lobbyist or whether she had been married before.
   Udall, 67, was first elected to the House in a 1961 special
election. He unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential
nomination in 1976.

   Federal marshals roved the southern West
Virginia coal fields Thursday to disperse striking miners and end
wildcat walkouts that have idled nearly 44,000 workers in 10 states.
   A disabled coal miner's 19-year-old son was grazed by a bullet at
a Mingo County mine in what state police said was the most serious
incident since the unauthorized walkouts began in West Virginia last
week. The teen-ager was treated at a local hospital and released.
   The target of the sympathy strikes, Pittston Coal Group Inc.,
announced Thursday night it was planning to move some salaried
workers from its operations in West Virginia to its holdings in
Virginia, where miners have been on strike since April.
   Pittston's president, Michael Odom, refused to elaborate on the
plan to move workers.
   The wildcat strikes in Appalachia and the Midwest are in support
of 1,900 West Virginia, Virginia and Kentucky miners' strike against
Pittston.
   The sympathy strikes prompted a spate of federal court motions
obtained by coal companies who want their miners back on the job.
Several coal companies in some of the 10 states involved have filed
complaints with the National Labor Relations Board against the
United Mine Workers, which in turn has filed unfair labor practice
charges against companies.
   U.S. District Judge Dennis Knapp on Wednesday fined six West
Virginia UMW locals, their officers and members for defying a
back-to-work order issued earlier this week. He ordered the U.S.
marshal's office to have deputies serve picketers at any of 12
Island Creek Coal Co. mines with copies of his order.
   Walt Biondi, U.S. marshal for West Virginia's Southern District,
said deputies were told to order any miners, demonstrators or
picketers to disperse and appear later for a contempt-of-court
hearing.
   Biondi said deputy marshals arrived in West Virginia on Thursday
from other states to help issue the orders. He declined to say how
many marshals were involved or how long they would be in West
Virginia.
   ``I think it's fair to say it's going to cost us at a minimum
several thousand dollars over the next couple of days,'' Biondi
said, declining to estimate the total.
   The additional manpower also is in anticipation of a federal
court hearing scheduled Friday for at least a dozen coal companies
seeking back-to-work orders for their striking miners.
   In U.S. District Court in Clarksburg, Judge William Kidd on
Thursday said he would rule soon on Consolidation Coal Co.'s
petition to force miners from six north central West Virginia locals
to return to work.
   Back-to-work orders also were sought by companies in Alabama and
Pennsylvania, and Consolidation has said it plans to seek similar
legal action in Illinois and Ohio.
   Jamie Blankenship, 19, was wounded early Thursday when a bullet
grazed his head while he was at Hampden Coal Co., a non-union mine
shut down by the wildcat strikes, state police said. Union and coal
company officials blamed each other, and police said they were
investigating.
   The wildcat strikes began June 13.
   The estimated number of miners involved Thursday in unauthorized
sympathy walkouts, according to union and industry officials, are:
West Virginia 16,000; Illinois, 8,000; Pennsylvania, 6,600; Alabama,
5,000; Ohio, 2,660; Indiana, 1,750; Kentucky, 2,325; Virginia, 755;
Missouri, 350; and Tennessee, 200.

   Casino executives reacted warily
Thursday to a judge's ruling that casinos may be held liable for
money lost by drunk gamblers. Some worried that it could give losers
a way to recoup their money.
   ``Maybe we have to put Breathalyzers at the door,'' said Roger
Wagner, president of the Claridge Casino Hotel, only half-joking.
   U.S. District Court Judge Mitchell Cohen ruled Wednesday that
casino operators, like tavern owners, have a responsibility to their
customers. The judge's decision stemmed from a lawsuit between the
Golden Nugget Hotel and Casino and a customer who lost $200,000.
   Shmuel Aboud, of New York City, said casino officials plied him
with free alcohol and pain killers for his aching back. The ruling
will allow a court case to continue toward a finding of whether the
casino was responsible for Aboud's losses.
   Some observers believe the ruling could mean casinos will stop
serving free drinks to gamblers and could force the gaming halls to
forbid drunk patrons from placing bets for fear of liability claims.
   Some casino executives believe the decision only reinforces what
the gaming halls already do. Jim Wise, a spokesman for TropWorld
Casino and Entertainment Resort, said, ``The judge uses such terms
as `obviously' and `visibly' intoxicated. We already follow those
guidelines. Anyone in that state is neither allowed more alcoholic
beverages or the opportunity to gamble.''
   An intoxicated gambler poses problems for a casino, Wise said.
   ``If someone does not have all his facilities, they have viable
reasons to complain afterward that they were treated unfairly,'' he
said.
   Stephen Hyde, chief executive officer for Donald Trump's two
casinos in Atlantic City, said, ``It is not in our best interests to
have a drunk sitting at a gaming table making a fool of himself.''
   Trump's casinos will stop serving an intoxicated customer, he
said.
   ``When you stop serving him, the patron usually does not go on
much further,'' Hyde said. ``He usually gets a little obnoxious and
ends up leaving the gambling floor.''
   But a liberal interpretation of the ruling could give customers
an easy way to reclaim large losses, Wagner said.
   ``Every idiot in the world will be suing us,'' he said.
   Likewise, casino executives in Nevada were worried about the
judge's decision. Roy Galyean, president of the Union Plaza Hotel
and Casino in Las Vegas, said, ``Are they suggesting that we
administer a drug-alcohol test to a patron before we let him
gamble?''
   Wagner said cocktail waitresses who stroll casino floors have a
scripted question: ``Would anyone like any complimentary coffee,
juice or soda?''
   ``We do not solicit free alcoholic beverages,'' he said. ``But if
a customer says he wants a beer instead of juice, he can have it.''
   Many gamblers will not drink alcoholic beverages ``because it
dilutes the decision-making process,'' Wise said.
   Lois Szabo of New Brunswick, sipping a pina colada at Trump Plaza
Hotel and Casino on Thursday, agreed. She said most casino customers
``are more interested in gambling than drinking. You get so caught
up in the slots that you actually forget to take a drink.''
   Some customers might take advantage of the decision ``because
some people would do anything to sue,'' she said. ``Personally,
everybody should be able to control themselves with liquor. When
some people drink excessively, they should be responsible for their
own actions.''
   Judge Cohen's ruling probably would attract the ``little guy,''
said Anna Krommer of Washington, relaxing with a beer at a casino
bar on Thursday.
   ``The casinos are a big attraction for the poorer people who
imagine they can become richer,'' she said.
   Gus Sunday of Philadelphia, who visits Atlantic City's casinos
about twice a month, said he has never seen a fellow gambler
intoxicated.
   ``Anybody who would get drunk has his own problems. It's not the
casino's problem,'' he said. ``People who come to Atlantic City are
not kids. They should have enough sense to know when to say no.''

<DATELINE>CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There's no prize, and the winner will have
to announce her age publicly. But that has not discouraged entries
in the competition to be named Illinois' oldest active farm woman.
   ``There are so many women active in agriculture today, we thought
it would be fun to see how many keep their hand in the business for
a long time,'' said Karen Benning of the Illinois Department of
Agriculture. The agency honored a 97-year-old Stark County man as
the state's oldest active farmer in 1987.
   The oldest farm woman does not have to live on a farm or drive a
tractor, but she must actively manage the farm or be a full partner
in its operation.
   ``It's hard to say whether there are more women or fewer women in
agriculture than men,'' said Mrs. Benning. ``There are a lot of
widows who have stayed with the operation, and more of that all the
time.''
   So far 20 people have requested entry forms, and many more are
expected by the July 21 deadline, said Mrs. Benning. The oldest
applicant thus far is 88 years old, she said.
   The top five candidates will attend the Illinois State Fair on
Aug. 15, when the winner will be announced.
   ``There is no monetary prize, but they will be our guests at the
fair,'' said Mrs. Benning.

<TEXT>
   The death toll from a Peruvian air force
plane that crashed into an Andean mountain has reached 60, officials
said today.
   The aircraft, a cargo plane converted to civilian transport,
crashed Thursday near Tarma, 100 miles east of Lima, killing all 60
Peruvians on board, the air force said. Witnesses said the plane
broke in two on impact.
   It was the sixth plane crash in Peru the past two years. Critics
blame most of the accidents on poor maintenance because of a
shortage of spare parts in Peru, which has been ravaged by high
inflation and a costly rebel insurgency.
   An investigation into the cause of the cause is pending.
   Gen. Edgar Sullca Flores, police chief of this central highland
city, initially said the plane had been carrying 42 people,
including military and civilians. The air force communique said
later that 42 of the 60 bodies had been identified.
   The Canadian-made Buffalo bimotor plane left the jungle town of
San Ramon, 126 miles northeast of Lima.
   The air force provides passenger service to towns in the remote
eastern Amazon jungle because the routes are not profitable for
civilian airlines.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Bush Taking A Long Slow Look at Iran's Ties With
Soviets</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union is moving swiftly to repair
its relations with Iran after the death of the Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini even as the Bush administration takes a long, slow look at
developments in Tehran.
   Both the Soviets and the United States were targets of the
cleric's wrath. With Khomeini's passing, Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev is working overtime to reverse a decade of bad feelings
and make inroads with his successors.
   But President Bush is standing firm on at least two U.S.
preconditions for a resumption of the relations severed by the
United States in 1980 five months after militants took over the
American embassy in Tehran and held the diplomats and Marine guards
hostage.
   Bush is insisting on renunciation of terrorism and help from Iran
to gain the release of the nine Americans held hostage in Lebanon by
pro-Iranian forces.
   It is a waiting game with an element of risk. An opportunity
could be lost. But Secretary of State James A. Baker III and
officials in the State Department who keep close tabs on Iran
apparently do not think so.
   The post-Khomeini situation is still cloudy. Two viewpoints are
still vying for control. One is the suspicious and fundamentalist
stance represented by the ayatollah. Its proponents are as wary as
Khomeini was of the United States and the Soviet Union. The second
is less uptight, but not any less inclined to fall under U.S. or
Soviet influence.
   The era of the late Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, who sought with
billions of dollars of U.S. weapons to be the kingpin of the Persian
Gulf, is past. ``It is in Iran's interest to play the Third World
game of balancing one superpower off against the other,'' a U.S.
official explained Thursday. This suggests Gorbachev's drive for
better ties with Tehran is unlikely to produce a pro-Soviet policy
in Iran.
   Besides, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity:
``Where is the urgency? Where is the fire?''
   The Soviets have been negotiating with Iran for three years to
purchase Iranian natural gas. The deal isn't struck yet. And it
remains the key to improved economic ties between Moscow and Tehran.
   Also, Gorbachev also could be running a risk. The Soviets are the
main weapons supplier to Iraq, the Iranians' bitterest enemy. If
Gorbachev gets too close to Iran he might lose influence in Baghdad
and with a number of other Arab countries traditionally hostile to
the Moslem but non-Arab Iranians.
   Still, Gorbachev heartily welcomed the speaker of the Iranian
parliament, Hashemi Rafsanjani, to Moscow this week. On Thursday,
the two sides agreed to exchange delegations of Moslem religious
leaders and the Soviets hinted in a communique they would send
weapons to Iran.
   The key phrase in the communique spoke of ``strengthening the
defense capacity'' of Iran. That could mean anything from Soviet
spare parts or replacements for armored personnel carriers and
artillery, which the Soviets provided Iran before the collapse of
the shah's Peacock throne a decade ago, to fighter planes.
   There was no nuanced phrase when Baker replied to congressional
inquires at a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing. ``We are
concerned about the possibility of weapons transfers,'' he said.
   Referring to his meeting in Moscow with Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze last month, Baker told Rep. William S.
Broomfield, D-Mich.: ``We indicated our concern across the whole
spectrum of questions involving proliferation of missiles and
chemical technology.''
   Asked by Rep. Lee H. Hamilton, D-Ind., about the Soviet embrace,
Baker said U.S. policy toward Iran will be guided by developments in
the country _ and not by Iran's relationship with the Soviet Union.
   Besides, Baker said, ``We do not know exactly what course the
developments in Iran will take.''
   This is the same unhurried approach Bush and Baker took at the
outset of the administration when Gorbachev was rolling out a series
of arms reduction initiatives. Last month, the president produced
his own proposal to reduce Soviet and U.S. forces in Europe as well
as NATO and Warsaw Pact weapons arsenals.
   Bush and Baker are taking a similarly measured approach to the
repression in China of forces seeking a more liberal Marxist regime.
Defending that policy against congressional calls for stronger
action, Baker said the administration was ``taking carefully
targeted actions while not being inflammatory in its rhetoric and
preserving its options for the future.''
   Five months old, the Bush administration's foreign policy is
developing several characteristics. Among them is an unhurried pace
and a basic idea that U.S. actions abroad will be guided by American
self-interest rather than by flashes of intuitive brilliance.

<HEAD>Administration Considering End to Loans for Food Aid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration may halt the
long-standing policy of loaning Third World countries money to buy
American food, says a high-ranking foreign aid official.
   ``One must wonder why our present food aid structure encourages
foreign countries to add to their debt burden and whether those
debts can be serviced in the future,'' said Philip L. Christenson,
assistant administrator of the U.S. Agency for International
Development.
   Christenson did not indicate whether some other way would be
found to pay for food purchases. He did say, however, that AID has
decided to make grants rather than loans in the future for long-term
development projects.
   Christenson testified Thursday before a hearing by the House
Select Committee on Hunger on whether the distribution of U.S. food
as aid should be restructured.
   Grants generally were used rather than loans when the Marshall
Plan and other aid programs began under President Harry Truman more
than 40 years ago, though Christenson did not go that far back in
his account.
   He said that 35 years ago loans to Third World countries were
considered highly secure, while today many countries have debt
burdens that are holding down their living standards.
   ``We are asking ourselves whether it makes sense to increase the
debt burden of these already over-extended countries in order to
finance the importation of a consumable,'' Christenson said.
   The Bush administration also wants to explore whether the loans
increase the role of government agencies in the borrowing countries
at a time when U.S. policy is to promote private business, he said.

<HEAD>S&amp;L Bailout Important, but Vacation Comes First</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of a House-Senate savings and loan
panel are calling for speedy enactment of President Bush's proposed
bailout _ but they're putting off work on it until they get back
from vacation.
   A conference committee appointed to reconcile S&amp;L bills, passed
by the Senate on April 19 and the House on June 15, held a brief
organizational meeting Thursday but did not tackle any of the issues
dividing the two chambers.
   Senate Banking Committee Chairman Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich.,
who was named chairman of the conference panel, scheduled the next
session for July 11.
   The Bush administration, noting that the industry is hemorrhaging
at a rate of $10 million to $12 million a day, has been pressing
Congress to move quickly ever since the president proposed his
bailout plan on Feb. 6.
   However, the Senate is taking off the last week in June and the
first in July. The House is due to be out of session only during the
July 4 week.
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, who is heading the House
delegation, said he was willing to work through the recess.
   ``The sense of urgency must be sustained,'' Gonzalez told
reporters after the meeting, adding that pressure from industry
lobbyists to weaken the bill ``never ceases.''
   ``I think it's important that we do it as soon as possible,''
Riegle agreed, but said it will take aides time to prepare an
analysis of the lengthy and complex bills _ 602 pages in the Senate
version and 770 pages in the House.
   Also, two of the five members representing the Senate on most
conference issues _ Sens. Jake Garn, R-Utah, and Paul Sarbanes,
D-Md. _ will be in Switzerland next week as part of a Senate team
monitoring U.S.-Soviet arms talks.
   In a related development, federal regulators took control of
three savings and loans in Georgia on Thursday, bringing the total
under government management to 226 in 32 states.
   The three are: First Federal Savings and Loan Association,
Americus; Habersham Federal Savings Bank, Atlanta, and Great
Southern Federal Savings Bank in Savannah. They have combined assets
of about $1.03 billion.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. has been taking over the most
deeply insolvent S&amp;Ls in preparation for congressional passage of
the S&amp;L bailout, which now appears unlikely before late July.
   Two other members of the Senate Banking Committee, John Heinz,
R-Pa., and Alan Cranston, D-Calif., are joining Riegle, Garn and
Sarbanes in the Senate conference delegation. Three members of the
Senate Finance Committee _ Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas; Spark Matsunaga,
D-Hawaii, and Bob Packwood, R-Ore. _ will represent the Senate on
tax matters in the bill.
   On the House side, Gonzalez is involving nearly everyone on his
51-member banking committee. He's divided the bill into five areas,
and a separate delegation of 12 to 14 Democrats and eight or nine
Republicans will represent the House on each issue.
   Gonzalez called on the conference panel to preserve tough new
capital standards for S&amp;Ls, which has been identified by President
Bush as the most important reform in the bill.
   The House would require S&amp;L owners to risk $3 of their own
capital for every $100 in lending. It allows five years for the
phaseout of an accounting break known as ``supervisory good will.''
The Senate standard is $1.50 and provides for a 25-year amortization
of good will.
   Gonzalez said the conference likely will agree on a 3 percent
capital standard but said the Senate delegation probably will try to
push back the five-year deadline on good will.
   The Senate adopted President Bush's plan to keep spending out of
the federal budget deficit. The House would include it in the
deficit, but exempt it from automatic spending cuts under the
Gramm-Rudman budget balancing law.

<HEAD>Asset Forfeiture Law Aids Fight Against Crime, Thornburgh Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court struck a blow against
organized crime and drug dealers by letting the government seize
assets which defendants wish to use to pay their lawyers, the
nation's chief law enforcement officer says.
   But attorneys groups said a pair of high court rulings Thursday
undermines the nation's system of justice _ tipping the balance
unfairly in favor of prosecutors.
   The court, in two 5-4 decisions, upheld the constitutionality of
federal laws that permit the confiscation of money and property from
people accused of crimes _ even if it means they cannot afford a
lawyer.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said the rulings are ``a notable
victory in the government's war on drugs. As the court put it,
Congress did not write this law to rewrite the old adage that `crime
does not pay' to read `crime does not pay except for attorneys'
fees.'''
   But Scott Wallace of the National Association of Criminal Defense
Lawyers said, ``We see these cases as a national tragedy. The
Clarence Darrows of today and tomorrow are going to go into some
other area of the law.''
   American Bar Association President Robert Raven, head of the
nation's largest lawyers' organization, said, ``The Supreme Court's
decisions today seriously weaken our criminal justice adversarial
system and impede a person's basic right to retain counsel of his or
her choice.''
   He said the ABA will ask Congress to amend federal law to shield
legal fees from confiscation.
   As it sped toward the expected end of its 1988-89 term next week,
the court also:
   _Narrowed a century-old federal law by giving cities important
new protection against big-money damage awards when they are accused
of violating people's civil rights.
   In the latest in a string of setbacks for civil rights activists,
the court said an 1866 law may be used to sue a city only if it can
be proved the alleged civil rights violation was part of an official
municipal policy. The court ruled against a former Dallas high
school football coach who said he lost his job because he is white.
   _Ruled 6-3 in a free-speech case from New York City that
communities may impose regulations aimed at keeping down the volume
at rock concerts.
   _Upheld a $200,000 libel award against Harte-Hanks
Communications, but the decision did not appear to weaken
significantly the news media's protections against such lawsuits.
   In the legal fee cases from Virginia and New York, the court said
the rights to due process and a lawyer's help are not violated when
the direct or indirect proceeds of allegedly illicit activities are
confiscated.
   At issue were forfeiture provisions of key federal crime-fighting
laws, the Continuing Criminal Enterprise Act and the Racketeer
Influenced Corrupt Organizations law.
   The rulings also left states free to enact or enforce similar
laws.
   The decisions said a criminal defendant's assets may be frozen
before trial if there is probable cause to believe they were
obtained illegally. Defendants who are acquitted may keep or recover
their assets.
   In one case, a law firm was denied $170,000 in legal fees for
representing Christopher Reckmeyer in 1985. He pleaded guilty in
Virginia to charges stemming from what prosecutors said was his role
as kingpin of a multimillion-dollar drug operation.
   Reckmeyer was sentenced to 17 years in prison and ordered to
forfeit all proceeds from the drug deals. That included a parcel of
land the government sold for $5.3 million. The seizure of his money
left him without funds to pay the law firm.
   In the second case, the government appealed a ruling that would
have allowed Peter Monsanto access to assets worth $400,000 to help
him pay his lawyers.
   Monsanto was convicted in New York City of charges he headed a
heroin-selling ring.
   The jury had ordered Monsanto to forfeit to the government a
house in Mount Vernon, N.Y., valued at $335,000, a $30,000 apartment
in the Bronx and $35,000 in cash. But a federal appeals court said
Monsanto could use the assets to pay his lawyers.

<HEAD>FAA Opts For More Inspections, No Ban On Radio Cassettes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Airline passengers can still carry laptop
computers or radio cassette players, but the devices are to be
closely inspected for plastic explosives on U.S. flights originating
in the Middle East and Europe.
   The Federal Aviation Administration, in announcing a new
inspection order to all arlines Thursday, said passengers who don't
need electronic devices on a trip ``should consider leaving them
behind.''
   But the agency and Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner
rejected proposals to ban the devices on all U.S. flights.
   Noting the inconvenience a ban of electronic devices might cause
businessmen and others who use laptop computers or electronic
equipment, Skinner announced the new measures in a speech to an air
freight group.
   His office had billed the announcement as a major step in efforts
to ensure aviation security.
   But the action by the FAA fell short of calls for at least a
temporary ban made by relatives of some of the 270 people killed in
the radio cassette bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland last
December.
   The new screening order is limited to U.S. flights originating in
Europe and the Middle East. It will not affect foreign airlines,
U.S. domestic flights, flights from the United States to Europe or
the Middle East, or U.S. flights to and from other countries.
   The flight 103 victims' relatives had called for the government
to require all airlines to refuse to carry any device that might
easily conceal plastic explosives, pending installation of
sophisticated detection equipment in airports used by U.S. carriers
in the United States and abroad.
   Skinner in April ordered airlines to install equipment that can
detect plastic explosives, with six units scheduled for installation
before the end of the year.
   Congress is considering legislation that would have the
government pay for the explosive screening equipment, at about $1
million per unit, out of a $6 billion aviation trust fund. The
administration wants the airlines to pay for more than 100 units it
wants installed over the next few years.
   Skinner said the new screening measures take effect immediately
and will include ``more than just turning on and off'' the equipment
as passengers board a plane. He said inspectors will go through a
series of checks, including possibly opening up the devices.
   The screening is not likely to put U.S. carriers at a competitive
disadvantage with foreign airlines, he said.
   Skinner said he expects several other countries to announce
similar increased screening, as the latest reaction to the Pan Am
bombing. British authorities are continuing their investigation into
who planted the bomb.
   Skinner said he consulted with top transportation officials of
other countries, and the officials agree that increased screening is
the most ``acceptable and effective'' method of dealing with the
danger.
   ``It is my firm belief that the option we have selected provides
the proper balance between passenger safety and convenience at this
time,'' Skinner said.

<HEAD>Senator Asks Fiske to Withdraw From Consideration for Justice Job</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leading Republican senator is trying to
persuade Robert B. Fiske Jr. to withdraw from consideration for the
Justice Department's second-ranking job to avoid a bitter Senate
confirmation fight.
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., the ranking GOP member of the Senate
Judiciary Committee, warned Fiske that conservatives could wage a
filibuster against his Senate confirmation if he is nominated to
become deputy attorney general.
   Fiske has been the object of conservative criticism for the role
he played in screening the professional qualifications of judicial
candidates for the American Bar Association.
   Some conservatives argue that when he chaired the ABA's Standing
Committee on Federal Judiciary, Fiske improperly applied ideological
standards to evaluate some of President Reagan's choices for the
federal bench.
   Thurmond, one of 14 Senate Republicans who have urged President
Bush not to nominate Fiske, made his appeal to the New York lawyer
at a meeting on Capitol Hill earlier this week.
   ``Sen. Thurmond is very concerned that a divisive, protracted
debate about this nomination would not be in anybody's best
interests,'' Christopher Simpson, the senator's press secretary,
said Thursday.
   Thurmond did not threaten to wage a filibuster but warned Fiske
that his conservative opponents might do so, Simpson said.
   The meeting on Wednesday was convened by Minority Leader Robert
Dole, R-Kansas, to give Fiske an opportunity to talk with senators
who had expressed opposition.
   Fiske's secretary at his New York office said he was traveling
Thursday evening and couldn't be reached.
   Also present were Sens. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., and John
Danforth, R-Mo., who are among 18 moderate and liberal GOP senators
who signed letters this week urging Bush to nominate Fiske, a
prominent New York lawyer who once was U.S. attorney there.
   Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., who opposes Fiske and attended the
meeting, said, ``The issue is causing an increasing polarization
among Senate Republicans.''
   ``That is something we can ill afford as the minority party in
the Senate,'' Humphrey said. ``There is no need for it. There are
lots of well-qualified people. Why should we have someone against
whom there is strong opposition?''
   ``Based on our concerns, the White House so far has declined to
make such a nomination. It is the Justice Department which is
lobbying for this candidate,'' Humphrey said.
   ``I haven't heard boo from the White House,'' he added.
   The intra-party squabble comes against the backdrop of a dispute
between the White House and the Justice Department over remarks
about Fiske that were inserted in a speech Bush made to U.S.
attorneys last week.
   A White House source, speaking Thursday on condition of
anonymity, said presidential aides were ``flabbergasted'' when Bush
told the federal prosecutors that he hoped Fiske would soon be
joining his administration.
   The Washington Post, in Thursday editions, quoted unnamed White
House sources as saying someone from the Justice Department inserted
the remark into the speech without the permission of Chief of Staff
John H. Sununu.
   David Runkel, chief Justice Department spokesman, disputed the
account, saying: ``I just don't think it happened the way it was
described.''
   The issue of whether to send Fiske's name to Capitol Hill is
still an open question at the White House, the source said.
   Despite the problems Fiske has encountered with conservatives,
Runkel said: ``I still believe that he is going to be nominated and
confirmed.''

<HEAD>Weight Is Bigger Problem in Midwest, South, Survey Says</HEAD>

   People in the Northeast and West are thinner than
Midwesterners and Southerners. Just ask them.
   The national Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday that
25.7 percent of the adults surveyed in Indiana and Wisconsin
reported that they were overweight, the highest percentage out of 32
participating states and the District of Columbia.
   On the other end of the scale was New Mexico, where only 15.2
percent reported being overweight.
   Among the five heaviest states _ Indiana, Wisconsin, West
Virginia, Ohio and North Dakota _ four are in the Midwest.
Meanwhile, the slimmest five are in the West: New Mexico, Hawaii,
Utah, Montana and Arizona.
   ``The prevalence of overweight in this report may be
underestimated,'' because people may not always tell the truth about
their weight, the CDC cautioned.
   The CDC survey, conducted in 1987, asked 47,975 adults about
their weight and height, and used the information to compile a
``body mass index.'' Overweight was defined as a level equal to the
fattest 15 percent of American adults in their 20s.
   By region, the West had the lowest overweight percentage, at 17,
followed by the Northeast, at 19.8 percent, the South, at 22
percent, and the Midwest, at 23.1 percent, the Atlanta-based CDC
reported.
   ``State and regional variations ... may result from differences
in eating habits and exercise practices,'' the agency said.
   An estimated 34 million adult Americans are overweight, putting
them at increased risk for diabetes, high blood pressure and some
types of cancer, the CDC said.
   The formula used to compute ``body mass index'' is this: weight
in kilograms, divided by height in meters squared. A figure of 27.8
or higher for men or 27.3 or higher for women indicates overweight,
the CDC said.

<HEAD>Book Calls For End to Farm Subsidies, Sets Up Legislative Debate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new book raises an old cry for abolishing
government farm programs, which the author says have been trampling
on individual rights, sacrificing the poor to the rich and giving
lawmakers and bureaucrats vast arbitrary power over Americans.
   The book already has stirred the ire of some farm groups and is
expected to provide further fuel to new debates in Congress on farm
policy legislation for the 1990s.
   James Bovard, a policy analyst for the Cato Institute and the
Competitive Enterprise Institute _ two Washington research firms _
says the government for 60 years has ``devotedly repeated the same
agricultural policy mistakes.''
   At ``roughly $25 billion a year in federal handouts and $10
billion more in higher food prices,'' Bovard says that would give
every full-time subsidized farmer two new Mercedes Benz automobiles
each year.
   ``Annual subsidies for each dairy cow in the United States exceed
the per capita income for half the population of the world,'' he
says. ``With the $260 billion that government and consumers have
spent on farm subsidies since 1980, Uncle Sam could have bought
every farm, barn and tractor in 33 states.''
   Bovard's book, ``The Farm Fiasco,'' is being published this month
by the ICS Press, Institute for Contemporary Studies, of San
Francisco.
   The book is coming out as Congress begins to move toward new
general farm legislation to replace the Food Security Act of 1985,
which is set to expire next year. The 1985 law itself was a step
toward more market-orientation in farm programs and a modest shaving
of some features of federal commodity subsidies.
   Bovard thinks more is needed, and quickly. President Bush, he
said, should send a special message to Congress immediately calling
for the abolition of the sugar, tobacco, peanut, honey, wool, rice
and cotton programs. After those reforms, the other commodity
programs should be ended.
   ``It is vital that President Bush set the terms of the farm
debate, that he avoid being boxed in by the farm lobby's usual scare
tactics and that he avoid at all costs getting locked into a
Reagan-style `rope-a-dope' defense in which he spends all his time
either denying that a farm crisis exists or asserting that farmers
are responsible for their own problems,'' he said.
   Benny Bunting, president of the National Family Farm Coalition,
said Thursday that Bovard's book is ``full of outrageous claims that
do not contribute to the difficult task of developing sound policy''
for American agriculture.
   Bunting, an Oak City, N.C., farmer, said it was ``shortsighted''
of Bovard to seek their outright removal.
   The coalition says it is made up of 42 national, state and
grassroots organizations committed to saving the family farm.
   David L. Senter, national director of the American Agriculture
Movement, said the AAM ``expected that kind of a conclusion to come
from the book,'' referring to Bovard's call for an end to farm
programs.
   ``We think he's off base in his assumptions and analysis of farm
programs,'' Senter said in a telephone interview. ``It's one of
those things that we in agriculture have to deal with from an
educational standpoint, as far as the general public is concerned.''
   Senter was asked about a passage in one of Bovard's chapters
listing ``myths of farm policy,'' one of which, in the author's
view, is farm bankruptcy.
   ``Hostility to farm bankruptcies stems partly from the notion
that any clodhopper can be a good farmer, so it is a shame to throw
one fool off the land and put another in his place,'' Bovard said.
``Federal agricultural policy implicitly presumes that the farmers
currently on the land are the best of all possible farmers _ and
that we should pay any price to keep them in possession of their
farms. This is why Congress forces the Farmers Home Administration
to give new loans to farmers who cannot or will not repay previous
(FmHA) loans.''
   Senter replied, ``You cannot look at a farmer that has operated
successfully for 20 or 30 years and then all of a sudden figures
he's become inefficient and is not doing a good job.''
   He added, ``There's all kinds of things, from weather to prices,
to policy ... there's all kinds of interference in agriculture
beyond the farmer's control that affects his ability to stay on the
farm.''
   Senter said books such as Bovard's ``do not look at the whole
picture. They come from a very narrow, biased philosophy against
farm programs'' and the authors ``go to any length to try and make
that point.''

<HEAD>Eagleburger Sees No Legal German Reunification</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The No. 2 official in the State Department
predicted the Soviet Union will not soon allow East Germany to
reunite with West Germany, despite improved Kremlin relations with
Bonn's government.
   Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger told a Senate
panel that increasing pressure in both Germanies to unify may bring
greater contacts between the nations, but that no legal
reunification will likely result.
   ``I think what you see over the course of the next decade or two
is an increasing German desire for some form of reunification,''
Eagleburger said Thursday. ``If it comes in any reasonable period of
time it will come in fact, not de jure (in law).''
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev recently completed a state
visit of West Germany that highlighted improved relations between
the Soviet Union and Bonn. Gorbachev said during the trip that he
could envision a day when the Berlin Wall dividing East and West
Germany could come down.
   But Eagleburger told the Senate Foreign Relations European
subcommittee that current political conditions are not ripe to erase
the borders that were created after World War II.
   ``There are a lot of countries in western Europe ... and
certainly in eastern Europe, who do not contemplate with any joy
whatsoever a reunified Germany,'' he said. ``So that I have great
difficulty conceiving of a tim when the Soviet Union, in my lifetime
at least, will with equanimity look toward some reunified if neutral
Germany. I just don't think that's in the cards for them.''

<HEAD>Heterosexual AIDS Cases Holding Steady</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The proportion of AIDS cases transmitted through
heterosexual contact continues to hold steady at around 4 percent,
according to federal researchers.
   The Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday that
heterosexual transmission of AIDS accounts for 4,305, or 4.4
percent, of the total of 97,193 AIDS cases in the United States.
   Although the percentage of heterosexual cases ``has remained
relatively stable'' in recent years, the characteristics of that
group are changing, the Atlanta-based agency said, citing an
analysis of the 3,962 adults with heterosexual cases of AIDS through
March 1989.
   Prior to 1985, more than half the heterosexual AIDS cases in the
United States occurred in people born in other countries, such as
some African nations, where heterosexual transmission is the chief
way AIDS is spread. In the United States, most cases are linked to
homosexual contact.
   But since 1985, the majority of heterosexual cases have been in
people who had sexual contact with a person either infected with
human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS, or at high risk of
infection, such as an abuser of injectable drugs or a bisexual, the
CDC said.
   Through March of this year, 65 percent of the reported
heterosexual AIDS cases occurred in people who had sex with a
high-risk partner, the report said. The majority of those partners
were drug users.
   Among the 4,305 heterosexual-transmission AIDS patients, 2,499,
or 58 percent, are women. Women account for only 9 percent of all
AIDS patients.
   ``An appreciable proportion of HIV infection among women in the
United States is acquired through heterosexual contact,'' the CDC
said in its weekly report. Because AIDS infections are more
prevalent in men, ``a woman is more likely than a man to have an
infected heterosexual partner.''
   The CDC noted that the actual number of heterosexual AIDS cases
may be higher than 4,305. Nearly 3,000 more AIDS patients who are
classified either as bisexual males, intravenous drug abusers or
hemophiliacs also reported heterosexual contact with an AIDS-risk
person.
   ``Some of these persons may have acquired HIV through
heterosexual contact rather than through these other routes,'' the
CDC said.

<HEAD>Female Veterans Not Collecting Their Due</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many female veterans of the Vietnam War aren't
collecting their benefits even though they show the same war-related
disorders as male veterans, witnesses told a congressional panel.
   Retired Rear Adm. Frances Shea-Buckley, chairwoman of the
Department of Veterans Affairs advisory committee on women veterans,
said a survey found women were routinely excluded from government
studies of such veterans' problems as Agent Orange contamination and
post-traumatic stress syndrome.
   ``We also found a general lack of awareness or concern about the
effects on women of their experiences in the combat theater,'' she
told a House subcommittee Thursday.
   ``We believe the VA should address the war experience of women
who served in Vietnam, specifically the physical, reproductive and
psychological effects,'' she said.
   She said one of the biggest problems in extending benefits to
female veterans is getting women to admit they served in the armed
forces.
   ``They don't see themselves as veterans,'' said Shea-Buckley.
   She said veterans hospitals are not setting up proper mental
health programs for women because few women come forward for help.
   ``It is difficult to provide a true therapeutic community for a
minority of one or two women,'' she said.
   Susan Mather, chief of women veterans programs for the Department
of Veterans Affairs, said several studies have been done on the
health effects of Vietnam service.
   ``Results indicate significant differences between women who
served in Vietnam and those who did not,'' she said. ``Nearly 27
percent have had PTSD (post-traumatic stress syndrome) at some point
in their lives and an additional 21 percent have some symptoms of
PTSD.''
   Rep. Lane Evans, D-Ill., chairman of the Veterans' Affairs
subcommittee on oversight and investigations, called the hearing as
a follow-up to the first hearing on the women veterans two years ago.
   ``Women have particular problems related to post-stress disorder
and there needs to be particular attention paid to that,'' said
Evans.
   Women can get all the benefits available to male veterans _
including extensive health care opportunities, educational
assistance and housing loans as long as they have spent one year in
service, said Mather.
   Linda Caldwell, chairwoman of the advisory commission on women
veterans in New Jersey, shared Shea-Buckley's opinion about getting
women to come forward as veterans.
   She said Vietnam era women veterans are particularly reticent
about identifying themselves.
   ``When pressed for details, they often reply, `I'd rather forget
that part of my life,''' she said.
   She said World War II veterans are most vocal about their needs,
primarily nursing care since they are now among the aging population.
   The 1980 Census, the first to ask women if they were veterans,
counted 1.1 million women had served in the armed forces, or 3.1
percent of the veteran population. Women veterans' now are believed
to comprise about 4 percent of the veteran population, said Mather.

<HEAD>Scientists Explode Powerful Nuclear Weapon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MERCURY, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A powerful nuclear weapon was detonated
under the Nevada desert, and officials intend to explode a second
one Saturday.
   The year's sixth underground nuclear test at the Nevada Test Site
was declared a success Thursday. No radiation escaped.
   ``Nothing has gone wrong with the test, the scientists appear
pleased,'' said Energy Department spokesman Jim Boyer.
   Immediately after the test, Boyer announced Saturday's detonation
near the same area of the test site.
   Saturday's test, like Thursday's, will be 20 to 150 kilotons, the
upper limit allowed under treaties with the Soviet Union.
   Energy Department officials said Thursday's blast was set off
without incident 1,800 feet below the surface of Pahute Mesa, about
105 miles northwest of Las Vegas.
   The weapons test, code-named Contact, was announced in advance,
indicating it was close to the 150-kiloton limit.
   The blast registered 5.2 on the Richter scale at the National
Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo., said center
spokesman Waverly Person.
   Boyer said the blast shook the control center housing scientists
monitoring the explosion some 30 miles away and kicked up a large
amount of dust over the site of the underground explosion.
   ``We're feeling considerable, rolling motion here,'' Boyer said
by telephone seconds after detonation.
   The test, conducted by the Lawrence Livermore Laboratories for
the Energy Department, had been scheduled Wednesday morning, but was
delayed for 31 hours because the prevailing winds were blowing
toward Las Vegas.
   Tests are not conducted when winds are blowing toward a populated
area in case radioactive gases escape the underground cavity where
the nuclear device is detonated.

   A U.S. relief worker was kidnapped Thursday in
the Israel's occupied Gaza Strip, and the kidnappers apparently
demanded Israel release Palestinian prisoners in exchange for his
freedom, Arab reports said.
   In Washington, U.S. officials confirmed that 37-year-old Chris
George, of the Westport, Conn.-based Save the Children Federation,
was taken by unknown kidnappers.
   It was believed to be the first kidnapping of a non-Israeli in
Israel or the territories it has occupied since the 1967 Middle East
war.
   ``As far as we know, he was taken today,'' a U.S. official said
late Thursday. ``We're not sure by whom.''
   The official, who asked not to be identified, said George
apparently was kidnapped at about noon Thursday in the Gaza area,
although the exact location was unknown. George, a native of
Montclair, N.J., is the co-director of Save the Children in Israel
and the occupied territories.
   ``We've been in touch with local authorities on that, and both
the secretary of state and the president have been fully briefed on
this,'' the official said.
   Arab reports from Gaza said George was last seen at midday during
a trip to Gaza City.
   The reports said a Palestinian man walked into George's office on
the main Omar el-Mukhtar street and told the relief worker:
   ``I would like to talk to you. Could you come outside?''
   George's wife, Liz, reached by telephone early Friday, said she
had no precise information on his whereabouts.
   ``We are not sure what happened,'' she said.
   Several hours after George's disappearance, the office of the Red
Cross in Gaza received a ransom demand, Palestinian reports said.
Some reports said it came in the form of a written letter in which
the kidnappers demanded Israel release Palestinian detainees.
   It reportedly demanded the release of detainees belonging to the
Moslem fundamentalist Hamas (Zeal) group, the radical Syrian-backed
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and Yasser Arafat's
mainsream Fatah branch of the PLO.
   More than 200 Hamas activists have been detained since an Israeli
army crackdown in May. Among them was the movement's elderly leader,
Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, whom the letter reportedly mentioned by name.
   Last Sunday, the Israeli government outlawed Hamas along with two
other Moslem fundamentalist groups, the Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah,
a radical Shiite militia that mostly operates in Lebanon and is
believed to be holding foreign hostages.
   Fourteen foreign hostages, including nine Americans, are being
held in Lebanon by pro-Iranian Islamic fundamentalists.
   The longest-held foreign hostage is Terry A. Anderson, 41, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, who was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   The ransom letter, Arab reports said, also demanded an inquiry
into the death of Omar Qassem, a senior figure in the Democratic
Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a radical Marxist PLO faction.
   Qassem, 48, died on June 4 after spending 21 years in Israeli
jails.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Donald Cofman declined to provide any
comment on the reported kidnapping.
   George, a former peace corps volunteer based in Oman, has also
been stationed in Lebanon and for the last two years has headed Save
the Children in Gaza.
   For the last year and a half, he has been a co-director of the
foundation, based in Jerusalem. George has two children and speaks
fluent Arabic.
   The Save the Children Federation Inc. is a private international
development and relief organization that employs over 3,000
employees in 40 countries.

<HEAD>HHS Secretary Says Medicare Reform Opponents Deceive Public</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's health chief says doctors who
criticize a Bush administration-backed plan to curb Medicare growth
with annual spending targets are ``engaged in a deception of the
American public.''
   Dr. Louis Sullivan, secretary of the Department of Health and
Human Services, told a group of female physicians Thursday an
American Medical Association attempt ``to conjure a picture of
governmental control and rationing of health care'' is off base.
   ``That is not correct,'' Sullivan said in a speech to the
American Medical Women's Association. ``They are engaged in a
deception of the American public.''
   He said the plan backed by the administration and approved last
week by a House subcommittee would help reduce growth in physician
spending under Medicare, which has been growing by 16 percent a year.
   ``The introduction of Medicare reform will help to meet the
changing landscape of health care in our nation,'' Sullivan said.
``It is a step that might have been anticipated by America's
physicians.''
   Sullivan outlined the plan for the American Medical Association
in a speech to the group's annual convention earlier this week,
saying it offers a better cost-control solution than a total
overhaul of Medicare.
   But Dr. James Sammons, AMA executive vice president, said the
plan would result in ``rationing'' of medical care.
   Dr. Susan C. Stewart, president-elect of the American Medical
Women's Association, said her group has taken no position on the
proposed Medicare overhaul.
   Under the plan, the government would set an ``expenditure
target'' for Medicare physician spending, based on the previous
year's spending with adjustments for inflation and the number of
Medicare enrollees. If the target is exceeded one year, the money
could be recovered by cutting the next year's budget.
   The plan also would change the way doctors are reimbursed by
setting a uniform national fee schedule that would take into account
the time, effort and overhead needed to perform a specific service.
Under the schedule, family practitioners and other physicians whose
services are mostly in the form of office visits would see their
fees rise at the expense of surgeons, ophthalmologists and other
specialists.
   A third part of the plan would limit the amount a physician could
charge a patient above the amount reimbursed by Medicare.
   Sullivan has said the administration would not accept the changes
in physician payment and balance billing without expenditure
targets, which are aimed at controlling the volume of medical
services.

<HEAD>American, Delta Drop Reservations System Merger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Airlines and Delta Air Lines said they
were blindsided by the Justice Department's opposition to the
planned merger of their computer reservation systems into one $2
billion venture.
   The airlines ended the attempted merger Thursday after the
Justice Department threatened to file an antitrust suit alleging the
joint operation would harm competition in the computerized sale of
airline tickets.
   ``We explicitly structured the partnership to satisfy the
previously expressed concerns of several departments of the U.S.
government about single-carrier ownership of (computer reservation)
systems,'' said Robert L. Crandall, chairman and president of
American.
   The proposal to merge the computer reservation systems, known as
CRS, would have ``gotten the government off our back,'' said Delta
spokesman William Berry. ``We owned our system outright, and the
government had been complaining that single ownership of CRS was not
good.''
   Delta and American had intended to sell up to 50 percent of the
merged system to other airlines and already had received expressions
of interest from Alaska, Southwest, Lufthansa and more than a dozen
other carriers, Berry said.
   ``The likely result of this transaction would be higher fares and
poorer service for airline passengers,'' Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh said in a statement.
   American operates Sabre, which has 41 percent of the nationwide
market among the five systems used by airlines and travel agents.
Sabre took in $445 million in fees last year, the Justice Department
said. Delta's Datas II, the smallest of the CRS ventures, did $68
million in business last year.
   The computer systems, the primary channel for the distribution of
airline tickets, provide up-to-the-minute information about
schedules, fares, seat availability, hotels, car rentals and package
vacations.
   Despite a 1986 regulation that says airlines must not favor their
own flights in computer listings, ``Travel agents using a particular
CRS tend to sell a disproportionately high number of tickets on that
CRS owner's airline,'' according to Judy L. Whalley, acting
assistant attorney general for the antitrust division.
   Crandall said American will continue to seek partners for its
computer system.

   An environmental coalition is warning that the
Bush administration's clean air proposals would not deal with the
``frequent and pervasive'' accidental releases of toxic chemicals at
industrial plants.
   ``Chemical accident prevention has not yet become national
policy,'' Gerald V. Poje of the National Clean Air Coalition told
the House Energy and Commerce environment subcommittee Thursday.
   Testimony before the subcommittee focused on the 2.7 billion
pounds of toxic chemicals released into the air each year, including
360 million pounds of cancer-causing substances.
   President Bush has proposed legislation to regulate airborne
toxic chemicals as part of his comprehensive clean air package. Two
other versions have been introduced in the House and another has
been proposed in the Senate.
   Neither Bush's language nor a bill introduced by House Energy and
Commerce Committee Chairman John D. Dingell, D-Mich., include
provisions on accidental spills.
   A version introduced by Reps. Mickey Leland, D-Texas and Guy
Molinari, R-N.Y., backed by environmental groups and their
congressional backers, would deal with the problem. So would the
Senate bill, introduced by key members of the Senate Environment
Committee.
   The Leland-Molinari legislation would require the Environmental
Protection Agency to develop a list of substances most likely to
endanger the public through accidental releases to the air, and
force the agency to issue regulations to prevent such releases. The
Senate bill has similar language.
   Robert C. Forney, a Du Pont Co. executive testifying for the
Chemical Manufacturers Association, said the chemical industry
opposed new legislation on accidental releases because ``a great
deal has been done by industry'' to prevent accidents, and ``we
don't believe additional legislation is required.''
   ``I find it difficult to understand that position,'' said
subcommittee Chairman Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., who cited
Environmental Protection Agency figures showing there were more than
4,700 accidental releases between 1980 and 1987. The 120 most
serious releases killed 145 people, injured more than 5,000, and
caused nearly 250,000 to evacuate their homes, Waxman said.
   Poje said, ``Chemical accidents at industrial facilities are
frequent and pervasive problems. While individual impacted
facilities and communities may learn important lessons from an
accident and thereby improve safety consciousness, it is by no means
guaranteed under the present system.''
   Industrial facilities and communities ``are unprepared to
understand and respond to the consequences of chemical accidents,''
he said.
   Forney also said the nation's chemical manufacturers have
reversed their previous opposition, and now support legislation to
control airborne toxic chemicals as part of new clean air proposals.
   ``We intend to be a constructive player in the legislative
process,'' he said.
   Forney said the chemical industry's trade group previously
believed new legislation was unnecessary, but has now concluded the
Environmental Protection Agency ``cannot adequately regulate air
emissions under the existing law.''
   EPA now regulates only seven of the more than 200 toxic chemicals
released into the air.

<BYLINE>Ohio Calls For Trash Tax on Neighbors' Garbage ^By KATHERINE RIZZO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Ohio is asking Congress to consider taxing the
trash that crosses state lines.
   ``The importing of wastes has truly enraged the citizens of
Ohio,'' Richard Sahli, chairman of the Ohio Solid Waste Management
Advisory Council, told a House subcommittee Thursday. ``We could
become the next New Jersey in just a few years.''
   New Jersey sends 55 percent of its trash out of the state,
including 1.5 million tons a year to Ohio, a state whose landfills
last year doubled their intake of imported garbage.
   Sahli said Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste proposes a $40-a-ton tax on
garbage shipped long distances.
   ``Such a tax would act as an incentive to states to take care of
their own waste disposal needs and not create ... potential
environmental problems in communities located hundreds of miles
away,'' he said.
   The money could be used to encourage recycling, develop markets
for recycled products and to increase Environmental Protection
Agency funding for research into better ways of handling solid waste.
   The garbage shipped to Ohio alone would generate more than $100
million if taxed at the suggested $40-a-ton rate, he said.
   Ohio last year took in 2.4 million tons of out-of-state waste, up
from 1.2 million tons in 1987.
   ``We simply do not have adequate disposal capacity to become the
East Coast's dumping ground,'' Sahli told the House Energy and
Commerce transportation and hazardous materials subcommittee.
   The Natural Resources Defense Council said 15,000 landfills have
closed in the past 10 years, leaving about 5,000 nationwide. All of
Florida's landfills must close within 10 years because of threats to
groundwater, the environmental group testified.
   Paul Templet, secretary of the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality, said that state has 40 landfills, down from
800 in operation in 1980.
   ``Solid waste management in Louisiana has reached crisis
proportions,'' said Templet, who suggested a national recycling
program and strict landfill guidelines.
   Rep. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., said he would introduce legislation
that would treat trash the same way the government treats low-level
radioactive waste. His bill would force states to develop regional
compacts to deal with the garbage problem collectively.
   Donald Deieso, assistant commissioner of the New Jersey
Department of Environmental Protection, said the state hopes to end
all trash exports by 1992. He suggested Congress order every state
to become able to handle its own garbage by a certain date.

   The Chinese government today announced the arrests
of more student activists and said leaders of the crushed
pro-democracy movement sought to turn China into a ``vassal of
international capitalism.''
   Four student leaders were caught in Zhangjiakou, a city about 110
miles northwest of Beijing. One of them, Liu Fuan of Beijing Medical
University, was said to have organized health care for students who
mounted a one-week hunger strike last May on Beijing's Tiananmen
Square.
   Zhao Yiqiang, a teacher at the medical school, and his wife were
detained. Also arrested was Qin Weidong, a student at Beijing Iron
and Steel Institute. He was accused of organizing crowds to set up
barricades to block the military advance into the city.
   Troops smashed through the barricades on June 3, killing scores
of unarmed people as they shot their way toward students occupying
Tiananmen Square.
   The government has said variously that 200-300 people, most of
them soldiers, died in the unrest. Western intelligence reports and
Chinese witnesses say the death toll may have been as high as 3,000.
   A fifth person, a worker accused of beating soldiers and throwing
stones during the military attack, was also arrested in Zhangjiakou,
the Economic Daily reported.
   Beijing radio said today that 27 people were given prison terms
for rioting in the southern city of Changsha last April in the early
days of the protest movement. It said one of them, Li Weihong, was
given a death sentence with a two-year reprieve, meaning the
sentence will be commuted to life imprisonment if he behaves well
for two years.
   Twenty-seven people were executed Wednesday and Thursday,
including seven in Beijing for attacking soldiers and destroying
military vehicles during the June 3-4 military push to Tiananmen
Square. In carrying out the death sentences, China has ignored
international appeals for clemency and international sanctions,
including a cutoff of U.S. military aid.
   In Washington, the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday
unanimously condemned the ``murderous crackdown and brutal
repression of the pro-democracy movement'' and supported President
Bush's call for an end to the executions.
   In China today, Beijing radio also reported the arrest of Li Bin,
a worker accused of the murder and burning of Liu Guogeng, one of
the soldiers the government has raised to martyr status in the
struggle to put down the ``counterrevolutionary rebellion,'' as the
protests are now called.
   Liu's father, an army veteran who walks with a crutch, has been
shown frequently on state-controlled television being consoled by
the nation's top leadership.
   Despite the large numbers of arrests, more than 1,600 since early
June, the official media insists that the rebellion was perpetrated
by a ``small handful'' of agitators.
   The ``small handful'' is not identified, although dissident Fang
Lizhi, who is now under the protection of the U.S. Embassy, is
included among those branded ``counterrevolutionary elements.''
   An editorial in the People's Daily, the official voice of the
Communist Party, said today that ``class struggle,'' a concept that
had been in eclipse since the Cultural Revolution of 1966-76, was
still under way. ``We should not lower our vigilance,'' the paper
said.
   During the Cultural Revolution, tens of thousands of people were
jailed, persecuted and killed after they were accused of being class
enemies.
   Today's editorial said agitators were taking advantage of an
international trend of trying to push socialist countries toward
capitalism.
   ``We must fight against this trend. Otherwise, socialist China
will be turned into a vassal of international capitalism,'' the
paper said.
   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping, after rising to power a decade ago,
played down class struggle and talked instead of economic
modernization. However, he appears to have revived the ideological
line in a bid to smother dissent and hold onto power.

   The U.S. dollar fell against the Japanese yen
Friday, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose
moderately.
   The dollar ended trading at 140.35 yen, down 1.05 yen from
Thursday's close of 141.40 yen. It opened at 139.60 yen and traded
between 139.40 yen and 140.60 yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which lost 20.31 points
Thursday, gained 205.74 points, or 0.61 percent, to close the week
at 33,530.71. The index continued to rise throughout the trading day.
   The dollar's decline followed its plunge in New York, which
traders attributed to a false rumor that President Bush had been
shot.
   Toru Kanai, foreign exchange analyst with the New Japan
Securities Co., also said the dollar fell in reaction to its surge
of the past few weeks, which was widely considered unsustainable.
   On the stock exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues rose 199.98 points within the first 15 minutes of morning
trading.

<TEXT>
   History will get a price tag this weekend
when artifacts from the estate of Josiah Bartlett, a signer of the
Declaration of Independence, are auctioned by his descendants.
   The sale items include an extensive collection of 18th century
letters and papers, a watch, cowhide britches and a handpainted vest
Bartlett is said to have worn when he followed John Hancock in
signing the Declaration.
   ``I've never done anything of this magnitude and it's very, very
exciting,'' said auctioneer Martin Willis, who will handle
Saturday's ``American History at Auction'' at the Bartlett home in
Kingston.
   Born in 1729, Bartlett gave a lifetime of public service as
doctor, judge, governor from 1790 to 1794 and founder of the New
Hampshire Medical Society.
   He signed the Articles of Confederation, which governed the
nation after the Revolutionary War, and played a role in New
Hampshire's decisive ratification of the U.S. Constitution in June
1788, which replaced the articles.
   ``We think he was an extraordinary man who gave of himself
extraordinarily,'' said state archivist Frank Mevers.
   One of the more unusual sale items is an apothecary chest with
Bartlett's handwritten labels intact, as well as some of the
medicines he used as a physician, according to Willis. The
historical value of the chest, as well as pieces of period furniture
kept in the Bartlett house built in 1774, makes it difficult to
predict what prices they will bring, he said.
   But Bartlett's papers are even more difficult to value, Willis
said. The Smithsonian Institution made one of a flood of inquiries
from around the nation about the documents, and the state has set
aside $1 million to buy some of the papers.
   They include a 1743 copy book from Bartlett's school days in
Amesbury, Mass., where he was born; official correspondence marking
the ``Surrender of Proud Cornwallis to the Illustrious Washington''
at Yorktown to end the American Revolution; a 1748 receipt for
payments to the families of two soldiers and an Indian killed near
Concord, during the French and Indian War; Bartlett's charter for
the New Hampshire Medical Society; and a copy of a handwritten
biography of Josiah Bartlett by his son Levi.
   Mevers said state historians see the documents, which include
records kept by Bartlett's descendants after his death in 1795, as
an excellent account of early New Hampshire life.
   ``That's what makes them so unusual and so inestimable in
value,'' he said. In a recent interview, Bartlett's
great-great-great-great granddaughter, Ruth Ready, says she has
struggled with having to part with meticulously kept family history.
   Ready, 38, owns the home with her 71-year-old aunt, Janet Donahue
of New Rochelle, N.Y., who wanted to sell the estate. Ready hopes to
buy her aunt's half of the house with her share of the auction
proceeds.
   Pausing before a delicate-looking 18th century duckfoot table,
Ready described how it was saved from a fire that destroyed the
original Bartlett house in February 1774. The present house was
built later that year.
   ``The main reason I always liked it was because it has some
history,'' said Ready, a postal clerk. ``When I grew up, I wasn't
looking at it like a piece of furniture that could be worth a lot of
money _ it was more to me.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush says he'll enforce the Supreme
Court's ban on flag desecration laws, but he doesn't like it one bit.
   Bush returned to the White House late Thursday after a day trip
to New York where he mixed politics with a patriotic call to all
Americans to join his crusade for volunteerism.
   He made clear his distaste for the Supreme Court's 5-4 ruling
striking down the 48 state laws against flag burning and other
desecration.
   The president told 1,000 business leaders he understands the
legal basis for the ruling, and ``will see that the law of the land
is fully supported, but I have to give you my personal, emotional
response: flag burning is wrong, dead wrong.''
   Bush's distaste for the ruling was matched in Congress as a
bipartisan Senate passed a resolution condemning the Supreme Court
decision.
   ``Congress has believed that the act of desecrating the flag is
clearly not `speech' as protected by the First Amendment,'' said the
resolution, which passed 97-3.
   Sens. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and Howard Metzenbaum of
Ohio, both Democrats, and Gordon Humphrey of New Hampshire, a
Republican, were the only dissenters.
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., summed up the majority mood: ``We
must stand for America. The flag, the flag. America, America. For
us!''
   At a New York Republican fund-raising dinner later Thursday, Bush
urged the GOP to press for ``big legislative gains in Albany'' and
other capitals to keep the Democrats from rigging congressional
district lines after the 1990 Census.
   ``It is absolutely essential that we block the gerrymandering
ways of the Democratic party in all 50 states,'' he said. ``They've
done it to us in the past, and we can't let them do it to us again.''
   Bush also exhorted the faithful to wrest control of ``the most
powerful local office in America'' from incumbent New York Mayor Ed
Koch. He tried to play no favorites in the three-man Republican
field in September's primary, but stumbled and mispronounced the
name of front-runner Rudolph Giuliani, the former top U.S. attorney
in Gotham.
   ``Sorry, Rudy,'' he apologized.
   The ex-prosecutor, vying against Ron Lauder and Herbert London,
laughed it off, saying, ``If you haven't taken Latin, sometimes the
name Giuliani can be a little difficult.''
   Bush capped his New York visit with a stop at a black-tie banquet
marking the 100th anniversary of The Wall Street Journal. He hailed
the business newspaper as ``one of America's most trusted
publications,'' but quipped that the thing he really liked about it
is ``you don't carry Doonesbury.'' That comic strip has taken
frequent shots at Bush over the years.
   Bush also seized the occasion to repeat his pitch to corporate
America ``to enlist in a new crusade to bring national service into
every corner of America.''
   Bush's return from New York was delayed a half hour by an
accident involving containers of dangerous chemicals near Newark
International Airport that led him to detour in the fog to New
York's Kennedy Airport. Containers of two toxic and potentially
explosive chemicals overturned while being loaded on trucks next to
the Newark airport, but never spilled, officials said.
   Air Force One was flown to the other airport and Bush's motorcade
was held up at the banquet as the Secret Service plotted a new path
out of New York.
   Earlier, Bush elaborated on plans for a public-private foundation
called the Points of Light Initiative to spearhead the push for
volunteerism, and he chatted with youths who have spent years living
on the streets and now have found shelter at Father Bruce Ritter's
Covenant House.
   Barbara Bush joined him at the shelter, cradling one young
woman's three-week-old baby.
   At one point in the unusual rap session, when a boy told the
president he could make ``a $100 in 15 minutes'' peddling drugs,
Mrs. Bush remarked that the same boy had said earlier that selling
drugs led to jail, death ``and whatever the third (choice) was.''
   ``Doesn't always happen, though,'' the boy replied.
   ``Mrs. Bush,'' said the priest, ``the kids are bullet-proof.''
   ``Oh, I forgot that,'' said the first lady.
   New Jersey Gov. Tom Kean, named by Bush to head an advisory
committee for his Points of Light Initiative, said the emphasis on
voluntary service is ``a shift obviously away from the Great Society
because what it's saying is clearly there are limits to what
government can do.''
   Bush is pledged to seek $25 million a year for four years for the
foundation from Congress, but his director of national service, C.
Gregg Petersmeyer, emphasized, ``This isn't bricks-and-mortar. ...
This is a movement.''

   Dozens of anti-abortion demonstrators say they're
prepared to spend a year in jail rather than promise not to blockade
abortion clinics for two years, a defense lawyer said.
   ``We're willing to face the consequences,'' attorney Thomas
Olmstead said Thursday.
   Police prepared for a possible confrontation at the District
Court in adjacent Bellevue, where up to 50 faced sentencing today on
criminal trespass charges for attempting to block an abortion clinic
on Nov. 12.
   Fifty officers were placed on call and protesters were expected
to come from as far away as California, said Maj. Paul Olson, head
of the Bellevue Police Department patrol division.
   The security is partly in response to dozens of angry letters
Judge Joel Rindal has received from abortion foes, Olson said.
   An an initial sentencing hearing in April, Rindal stunned the
protesters when he said he would sentence them to the maximum
penalty of $5,000 in fines and a year in jail unless they promised
not to commit the same offense for two years. He gave them two
months to make up their minds.
   More than 40 defendants say they'll choose jail time, Olmstead
said.
   ``Throughout the Bible there are instances where the law of God
was more important than the laws of man,'' he said. ``Martin Luther
King broke the law throughout the South because he believed God's
law was higher than the law of Alabama.''
   Olmstead said protesters believe ``God is on our side.''
   ``There's no question what I'll do, I don't have a choice but to
go to jail,'' Jim Demers, who is defending himself in the case, told
the Journal-American, a Bellevue newspaper.
   Another defendant, Kenneth Bridges, said he would give up his
$45,000-a-year oil refinery job and go to jail if necessary.
   ``In good conscience, I couldn't promise a judge I wouldn't
commit another `rescue' for two years,'' he told the newspaper. The
protesters claim their blockade was an attempt to rescue fetuses
from abortion.
   But some defendants said they would promise not to break the law
because of family obligations.
   ``The harm psychologically and emotionally to my children would
be greater than any good I could do in jail for a year,'' defendant
Pat Landwhr said. But she said she was willing to spend as long as
50 days in jail rather than pay a possible fine of $1,000.
   ``I will not pay for the privilege of protesting in this
country,'' she said.

   Gov. Mario Cuomo urged the Legislature to
adopt a punishment of life without parole after lawmakers
indefinitely postponed an attempt to override his latest veto of a
death penalty bill.
   State Senate Majority Leader Ralph Marino said Thursday he was
postponing an override vote because of new cancer surgery for Sen.
James Donovan.
   A consistent death penalty supporter in the past, Donovan stunned
his colleagues last week when he said his bout with cancer had
caused him to have second thoughts about capital punishment.
   The bill's chief sponsor, Sen. Dale Volker, has said Donovan's
support was crucial to winning an override vote in the Senate.
   The chief Assembly sponsor of the bill, Democrat Vincent Graber,
said the postponement effectively put off a showdown on the issue
until next year, when all 211 legislative seats and the governorship
go before the voters.
   New York governors have vetoed legislation to reinstitute the
death penalty every year since 1977.
   After learning of the postponement, Cuomo issued a statement
appealing for quick passage of legislation for life without parole
for murderers.
   With senators unable to override his veto, the Democratic
governor said ``it is incumbent on them to explain what steps they
can take to provide the people of this state, particularly its
police officers, with a tougher penalty for the worst crimes.''
   The Legislature is expected to end its regular 1989 session at
the end of next week.
   New York's electric chair hasn't been used since 1963.
   For the past four years, the Republican-controlled Senate has
voted to override Cuomo's death penalty vetoes, but the effort has
fallen short repeatedly in the Democratic-controlled Assembly.
   This year, death penalty supporters felt they were within one
vote of winning in the Assembly before problems began appearing in
the Senate.

<HEAD>Victims of Rare Accelerated-Aging Disease Attend Annual Reunion</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   They are coming from Australia, Argentina
and South Africa as well as other far-flung places in search of
support and a cure for their rare disease.
   Fifteen victims of the accelerated-aging disease known as
progeria are gathering this weekend at the River Ranch resort in
this central Florida community for the eighth annual reunion
sponsored by the Sunshine Foundation.
   The boys and girls, ages 4 to 19, meet once a year with their
parents and siblings to enjoy themselves in a vacation setting,
exchange experiences and come under observation from doctors, who
monitor their progress and hope to develop an effective treatment
for the rare condition.
   The genetic syndrome, which has a reported incidence of 1 in 8
million newborn children, is characterized by rapid aging, dwarfism,
baldness and distortion of facial features and bodily joints. Its
cause is unknown. Patients usually die of cardiac complications
between ages 7 and 27.
   Among those who will take part in the weeklong gathering is
16-year-old Fransie Geringer, perhaps the best-known of the progeria
victims because of previous visits to the United States from his
home in South Africa.
   The publicity surrounding Fransie's trip to Disneyland in
California in the early 1980s led to the series of reunions by the
non-profit Sunshine Foundation, which was formed in Phildelphia in
1976 to grant wishes to terminally ill children.
   The youngest child scheduled to attend is 4-year-old Courtney
Arciaga of Bonita, Calif. The oldest is 19-year-old Greg Mercer of
Warner Robins, Ga.
   ``The families are very close. None of them knew each other
before the foundation began its reunions,'' said publicists Julie
Auspitz.
   The founder of the Sunshine Foundation, former Philadelphia
policeman Bill Sample, said: ``Because of these reunions, they're
not alone anymore. They have brothers and sisters now.''

<DATELINE>REYKJAVIK, Iceland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When word reached Iceland that the U.S.
military planned large-scale maneuvers beginning June 17, the
underlying strains of anti-Americanism surfaced on this fiercely
independent island nation.
   June 17 is Iceland's national day, and the U.S. forces had to
delay the start of their exercises by three days because of an angry
11-hour debate in the Icelandic Parliament and a warning from Prime
Minister Steingrimur Hermansson that the timing of the maneuvers was
unwise.
   Foreign Minister Jon Baldvin Hannibalsson also scaled down the
maneuvers from 1,300 to 1,000 reservists to allay parliamentary
outcry over a U.S. officer's erroneous description of the exercises
as the largest in Iceland since World War II.
   In this strategically important North Atlantic country, proud of
its independence, reliance on the American military for defense
draws gratitude from some and rancor from others.
   Iceland is the only member of the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty
Organization with no army or navy. Under the NATO treaty, the
Iceland Defense Force is all-American.
   With 250,000 inhabitants, Kentucky-sized Iceland has no interest
in raising its own army and the suggestion often sparks astonishment
and laughter.
   ``We are this unique nation that tries to maintain its
independence without any military force,'' Hannibalsson said in a
recent interview.
   When Iceland won independence from Denmark in 1944, most people
saw little point in establishing an army, he explained. ``Who was it
going to deter?''
   In World War II, the British beat the Germans to Iceland and
turned over its defense to the Americans.
   Col. Andrew Duncan of the International Institute of Strategic
Studies in London said Iceland was ``a rather large aircraft
carrier,'' halfway between Europe and North America. It is also on
Soviet submarine routes into the north Atlantic.
   The American presence is no longer the issue it was in the
1970's, but it is still viewed with ambivalence.
   At the government's request, enlisted servicemen in the
3,300-strong American force have a midnight to 6 a.m. curfew. Armed
Forces Television is also barred from broadcasting outside the NATO
base at Keflavik, 31 miles south of Reykjavik, where the Americans
live.
   Three of Iceland's four major parties have consistently backed
the American presence, but a September 1987 poll of 1,753 people by
the University of Iceland found just 41 percent wanted the Americans
to stay. Thirty three percent wanted them to leave and 26 percent
said they didn't care.
   By contrast, over 80 percent consistently support Iceland's
membership in NATO.
   Opposition to the U.S. military is led by a vocal left-wing
minority.
   ``We have been very unfriendly to them,'' said Gudrun
Helgadottir, president of Iceland's parliament, the Althing, and a
member of the left-wing People's Alliance.
   The alliance, part of the three-party center-left coalition
government, believes the U.S. presence makes Iceland a military
target and endangers Iceland's culture and language, she said.
   Incidents like the timing of this week's military maneuvers by
U.S. reservists from Westover Air Force Base in Massachusetts bring
to light the Icelanders' sensitivities.
   ``All of a sudden, it was a matter of national honor not to have
those exercises on national independence day and all of a sudden
people discovered they were a disgrace because now we're living in a
period of disarmament and peace,'' Hannibalsson said.
   He gave the go-ahead for the exercise, codenamed Northern Viking
'89, but changed the dates to June 20-28. He said it was far from
the largest held here and was similar to maneuvers in 1985 and 1987,
which he said nobody noticed.
   Last month, Iceland officially protested a farewell speech by the
outgoing U.S. commander, Rear Adm. Eric McVadon, in which he urged
Icelanders who support the American forces to speak out. McVadon
also implied that Icelandic authorities were ungrateful to U.S.
troops.
   A U.S.-NATO request to build a second airport in northern Iceland
has also aroused critics who fear a military build-up.
   Hannibalsson said he will decide in a few months whether to
authorize a feasibility study. If Iceland says no, Greenland has
expressed willingness to have the airport.

<HEAD>Chinese Intellectual Leader Escapes to Hong Kong</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A leader of an illegal organization for
intellectuals in China has been smuggled to Hong Kong as part of a
campaign to save pro-democracy activists from a crackdown in
Beijing, student activists said today.
   They said more dissidents and Chinese students who led the
movement for freedom were expected to arrive shortly in Hong Kong
from Communist China. One dissident already has gone to the United
States.
   Yan Jiaqi and his wife, Gao Gao, came to Hong Kong on Tuesday
from China, said the students, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
They said the couple were planning to go to the United States by way
of Western Europe.
   One Hong Kong student said he could release no details of the
escape other than to say they did not arrive by train or plane.
   ``There are many ways to leave China,'' he said.
   He said Yan and his wife ``were in a safe place'' but he refused
to specify where.
   On Thursday, another Chinese dissident, Liu Binyan, speaking in
Hong Kong, joked that Yan and his wife ``were even in a safer place
than I am.'' Liu came to Hong Kong from the United States on the
invitation of the Hong Kong Journalists Association.
   As a leader of the Beijing Independent Intellectuals Association,
Yan faced certain arrest in China. The organization was formed in
May and played an important role in the movement for freedom. The
Chinese government banned it and other independent organizations
when martial law began in Beijing May 20.
   Since June 3, when the Chinese army invaded Beijing, gunning down
unarmed citizens, China has moved to crush the freedom movement.
More than 1,600 have been arrested since early June and so far this
week 27 people have been executed.
   The Chinese government also has tightened its borders to prevent
activists from fleeing. The state press has reported participants in
the movement have been arrested boarding planes and trains in
attempts to leave Beijing.
   Yan was aided in his escape by Hong Kong students who belong to
the Committee for the Advancement of Democracy in China, a New
York-based dissident organization.
   An official of the group in New York said the organization is
dedicated to helping Chinese pro-democracy activists flee the
mainland.
   Another leading dissident, Su Shaozhi, arrived in the United
States on Thursday and went to live with his brother in Chicago. But
he refused to tell U.S. reporters how he left China.
   Su headed the Research Institute of Marxist Thought until 1987
when he was removed from his post during a campaign to battle
``bourgeois liberalization,'' or Western liberal thought.
   Su was not active in the recent protests for freedom. But he had
signed an open letter earlier this year calling for the release of
political prisoners including Wei Jingsheng, who was jailed in 1979
for calling for political change in China.
   He also advocated sweeping reforms of China's Communist system.
   Yan, however, did participate in the protests.
   He was a drafter of an essay criticizing senior leader Deng
Xiaoping and worked to organize intellectuals. On the day before the
June 3-4 crackdown, Yan was named president of the symbolic
Democracy University set up by students who occupied Tiananmen
Square.
   Yan and his wife are the co-authors of a well-known work on the
Cultural Revolution, the 1966-76 ultra-leftist movement that
destroyed the lives of many of China's intellectuals.

   Some moviegoers left a special showing
of ``Batman'' believing the Joker had the last laugh.
   One hour into a sneak preview of the much-publicized film,
spectators were driven batty when the movie played out of sequence.
   Right off the bat, members of the crowd rushed into the lobby of
the Warner Theater and demanded that the show be stopped until the
problem was fixed.
   When theater officials investigated, they found their copy of the
seven-reel movie had two reel 5s and no reel 4.
   Theater officials said they'll try to correct the problem for
this weekend's showings, but they're not sure if they can locate the
missing reel in time. ``Batman'' opens in 2,100 North American
theaters tonight.
   ``They just kept showing the ending,'' one spectator said after
the theater handed out rainchecks to the disappointed crowd. ``The
end was great. The middle, we don't know.''

<TEXT>
   Three high-ranking Cuban military officers
were arrested in a drug investigation ordered by President Fidel
Castro after the United States said his country helps drug
traffickers, the official Cuban news agency said.
   Prensa Latina added that Cuba is ready to take ``drastic
measures'' against drug smugglers, including shooting down suspected
airplanes using Cuban airspace.
   In an unusually detailed report Thursday, the agency praised the
government for ``uprooting the evil'' of drug trafficking. It also
acknowledged that Cuba is not immune from a problem that afflicts
much of the hemisphere.
   The investigation, undertaken in April, resulted in the June 12
arrest of two generals and a colonel accused of acting as middlemen
for a Colombian cocaine cartel based in Medellin.
   Prensa Latina said Castro ordered the investigation because the
U.S. charges added weight to information from ``friends of Cuba''
that ``drug traffickers could count on the cooperation of Cuban
officials.''
   ``Even though it is habitual in the United States to give room to
all sorts of slanders against the Cuban revolution, the coincidences
of the past several months caught the attention of President Fidel
Castro,'' Prensa Latina said.
   The report said Maj. Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa, Brig. Gen. Patricio de
la Guardia and Col. Antonio de la Guardia ``collaborated for the
last three years in the movement of drugs from South America to the
United States, using their authority and official functions.''
   The news agency said the officials admitted delivering about six
tons of cocaine and said they were paid $3.4 million for their
efforts.
   Prensa Latina said the cocaine arrived in Cuba in small airplanes
and was transferred to Miami-bound boats by the Cuban accomplices.
   It said the Cuban involvement began in 1986, when Ochoa acted as
Cuba's military liaison with other nations. It said a Panamanian
connection put Ochoa in touch with a ``North American citizen of
Italian origin named Frank Morfa.''
   It said Morfa suggested a money-laundering scheme that in turn
led to involvement with the Medellin cartel, reputedly the world's
largest cocaine smuggling ring.
   The arrested officers have been charged with disloyalty to the
people, the revolution and the national ethic.

   Here are some facts and figures on Angola.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE HISTORY _ Portuguese settlers reached Angola in the 15th
century and ruled it as a colony until Angola gained independence in
1975. Virtually all the Portuguese fled at that time, leaving the
country more than 90 percent illiterate and woefully short of
capital and skilled workers. After fighting a civil war since
independence, Angola formally accepted an agreement along with South
Africa in July 1988 that was designed to withdraw foreign troops
from Angola and grant independence to Namibia.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE LAND AND PEOPLE _ Angola, twice the size of Texas, is on the
southwest coast of Africa. Its capital is Luanda. Most of the
country is a plateau, with a tropical climate. Angola is bounded by
Congo on the north, Zaire on the north and northeast, Zambia on the
east, Namibia on the south and the Atlantic on the west. It has 8
million people, most of them living in tribal villages and rural
areas from three ethnic groups, the Ovimbundu, the Kimbundu, and the
Bakongo. Mixed-race and white Angolans comprise about 1 percent.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE GOVERNMENT _ The Marxist Popular Movement for the Liberation
of Angola, one of the guerrilla groups that fought the Portuguese,
has controlled the country since it seized Luanda in 1976 with the
help of Cuban troops. An estimated 50,000 Cuban troops helped the
government of President Eduardo dos Santos fight the rebels of the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), which
seeks a power-sharing agreement.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE ECONOMY _ Almost 200 oil wells in the Angolan enclave of
Cabinda supply more than 90 percent of the country's export
earnings. U.S. oil companies help run the petroleum fields. Cuban
and Angolan troops protect the fields against UNITA guerrillas, who
use American weapons to try to sabotage the facilities. Angola is
also rich in diamonds and has potential for mining other minerals,
including uranium. It also has rich agricultural land, but the
economy has been seriously disrupted by civil war since independence.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   UNITA _ Jonas Savimbi's UNITA rebels fought the Portuguese until
they departed and now oppose the MPLA government. UNITA receives
U.S. aid. South African troops backed the rebels until a pullout in
August 1988 under terms of a regional peace accord that UNITA did
not sign. UNITA says it controls about one-third of Angola and
claims widespread popular support.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE REFUGEES _ About 1.5 million Angolans fled areas of fighting
and are registered as displaced persons in the country by the U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees.

<HEAD>Administration Backs Civil Rights for Disabled, Lists Some Areas
of Concern</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration endorsed landmark
legislation to bring millions of disabled Americans into society's
mainstream but has disagreements over several specific provisions.
   ``We must end the anomaly of widely protecting women and
minorities from discrimination while failing to provide parallel
protection for people with disabilities,'' Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh said Thursday.
   Thornburgh told the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee
the administration was prepared ``to work in good faith toward a
consensus'' on areas of concern.
   Those areas included the scope of the public accommodations
provisions, the size of businesses covered by the employment
discrimination section and the inclusion of punitive damages as a
legal remedy, he said.
   But the attorney general and representatives of disabled-rights
groups played down the disagreements over the proposed Americans
with Disabilities Act.
   ``It's a historic day, the administration and the legislature for
mainstreaming disabled people,'' said Evan Kemp Jr., a member of the
U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. ``This is the first
administration that has ever taken a disability bill seriously.''
   ``I don't see any potential major areas of disagreement,'' said
Pat Wright, Washington director of the Disabled Rights Education and
Defense Fund.
   David Runkel, Thornburgh's chief spokesman, said ``there are some
differences'' but added that ``I don't think anybody sees there's
any insolvable problem at this time.''
   The bill would prohibit employment discrimination against people
with disabilities by business with more than 15 employees.
   It would also require theaters, restaurants and public offices to
make ``reasonable accommodations'' to improve access for disabled
persons that are ``readily achievable'' without posing an ``undue
hardship'' on businesses.
   New buses purchased by public transit authorities would be
required to be equipped with wheelchair lifts.
   ``We are firmly committed to the notion that every new bus
purchased by public transit authorities in the United States should
be fully accessible, period,'' Thornburgh said.
   ``What has to be examined is the coverage of the public
accommodations language. How many public accommodations are covered
will depend to a great extend on the definition that's given to
`reasonable accommodation,''' Thornburgh said.
   ``I hope that kind of examination will be at the top of the list
that should be considered in reaching some specificity'' of
definitions, Thornburgh said.

   Edmund and Mary Malzan remember when the
Cuyahoga River was clean enough to swim and fish in, then dirty
enough to catch fire.
   ``It's changed a lot since I've been here last. It sure looks
good to me now,'' said Malzan, who lives about 50 miles southeast of
Cleveland and last visited the river about five years ago.
   The couple stood on the riverbank near downtown Thursday and
watched the festivities marking the 20th anniversary of a pollution
fire on the Cuyahoga that made the city the brunt of countless jokes
nationwide.
   ``It's built up now,'' said Mrs. Malzan. ``It looks as if
somebody cares.''
   About 100 people gathered at the riverbank to commemorate the
anniversary. Some stressed they also were celebrating the area's
resolve to render the waterway freer of oil, chemicals and debris
dumped from this industrial city.
   ``We Americans tended to see the natural world as unlimited. Most
people probably never thought much about where the waste went,''
said Greg Studen, chairman of the Cuyahoga River Community Planning
Organization. ``The fire in the Cuyahoga River ... helped to destroy
that naive and outdated view forever.''
   As he spoke, firefighters on the Anthony J. Celebrezze _ the same
fireboat that extinguished the 1969 blaze _ nabbed a fish from the
river and held the dripping net and fish up for all to see.
   Absent from the ceremonies was Mayor George Voinovich, whose
administration at first refused to release the fireboat for the
event. The city feared it would resurrect some of the razzing the
city has endured.
   On June 22, 1969, a burning pile of unspecified debris,
apparently soaked with industrial contaminants already in the river,
was floating near a Norfolk &amp; Western railroad trestle. The wooden
trestle then caught fire.
   Local officials speculated a train rolling over the trestle
tracks sparked the fire in the river.
   The fire caused about $50,000 in damage, but some say more
extensive damage was wrought as the public conjured visions of
burning waters amid the city's steel, chemical and cement factories.
   The following year, songwriter Randy Newman penned ``Burn On'' in
tribute to the Cuyahoga fire.
   The Cuyahoga, a winding, 100-mile river that begins about 30
miles northeast of Cleveland and empties into Lake Erie, also had a
surface fire in 1936 and two in the 1950s.
   But sewage plants have been upgraded, discharge laws are tougher
and the steel plants don't produce the same volume as in the 1960s.
   John Olive, a University of Akron biology professor and a
specialist in river water quality, said analyses show more aquatic
life _ fish, mayflies and other insects _ are thriving. At the same
time, midges, leeches and other indicators of pollution are
decreasing, he said.
   Near downtown Cleveland, patrons can sip drinks from riverside
restaurants and watch pleasure boats skip across the river.
   About $1.5 billion has been spent by local government,
businesses, civic groups and others determined to change the face of
the Cuyahoga and make the 1969 fire stand for the day Cleveland got
tough, said Jim Cox, a local businessman who works with a remedial
action group trying to clean up the river
   ``It was used nationally as a symbol for the environmental
movement. It had very strong impact in getting the EPA started,''
Cox said. ``It's a cleaner river, more friendly to aquatic life and
human life.''

   A pilot federal program that tracks medical
waste from the hospital to the dump should make life more pleasant
for beachgoers and more expensive for illegal dumpers, New Jersey's
senators say.
   ``Who wants to tiptoe through the needles?'' asked Sen. Frank
Lautenberg, D-N.J., as he and Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., discussed
implementation of the 1988 Medical Waste Tracking Act, which became
effective Thursday.
   The two senators held a news conference after meeting with
Environmental Protection Agency officials to discuss the program,
which could be made nationwide after it is evaluated by Congress.
   The federal law authorizes a two-year pilot program that subjects
producers, transporters and disposers of medical waste in New
Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Louisiana, Rhode Island, the District
of Columbia and Puerto Rico to federal and state inspections and
legal action.

<HEAD>Panel Restores Funds For V-22 Osprey</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A House subcommittee has sent Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney ``a clear signal'' by approving an amendment to save the
V-22 Osprey aircraft by giving it $351 million of research and
development funds, says Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa.
   The amendment was approved 11-7 during a closed session of the
Armed Services research and development subcommittee, according to
aides to Weldon, who sponsored the amendment with Rep. Thomas
Foglietta, D-Pa.
   The amendment was backed despite opposition by the subcommittee
chairman, Ron Dellums, D-Calif., and by Rep. William Dickinson,
R-Ala., the panel's ranking Republican, according to Weldon press
aide Doug Ritter.
   Cheney, in overseeing cuts in the fiscal 1990 budget promised by
President Bush, announced in April that he was scuttling the V-22
program as too expensive. He has held that position in spite of
congressional pressure and threats by contractors to begin layoffs.
   The V-22, described by the Marine Corps as its most important
weapons program, is a revolutionary aircraft designed to take off
like a helicopter and fly like a plane.

<HEAD>TV Networks Ask Congressional Help in Battle for TV Rerun Rights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The three major TV networks, contending the
tradition of free television is threatened, have asked Congress to
side with them in a war against Hollywood studios over lucrative
syndication rights to reruns of popular shows.
   The top executives of CBS, ABC and NBC warned that unless the
rules are changed so they can get in on the syndication of such
shows as ``Jeopardy'' and ``Cheers'' viewers may have to start
paying for the World Series, Olympics and Super Bowl on TV.
   ``At any point in time, the cable systems can take away the World
Series,'' Laurence A. Tisch, president of CBS Inc., told the Senate
Commerce Committee's communications subcommittee.
   At issue is a regulation issued in the 1970s by the Federal
Communications Commission forbidding networks from having any
ownership in programing they did not produce or from selling them to
independent TV stations for syndicated reruns.
   The FCC, as well as the Federal Trade Commission and Justice
Department, called for repeal of the so-called Financial Interest
and Syndication Rule in 1983 as an antiquated regulatory practice.

<DATELINE>GILROY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A driver doing 60 mph on a freeway was
surprised when something smacked the rear of his covered pickup.
Surprise became shock when he turned and saw two injured
motorcyclists lying in the truck.
   ``I looked in the rearview window after something smashed
violently into my truck,'' Lawrence Wilson said in a telephone
interview Thursday night. ``I saw a gaping hole in the camper shell
and the tailgate was flattened.
   ``I was preparing to pull over to pick up the debris from the
crash, and then I got this unusual sensation, as if I was dreaming.
And then this guy looked (through the rear window) and said, `Dave
is hurt, can get you get help?' I thought I better pull over and
look for Dave, but the guy said, `No, Dave's here.' They were there,
lying there like they had been sleeping in the back of the truck for
hours.''
   Wilson, 35, drove straight to a hospital after the motorcycle
driver and passenger crashed through his tailgate and camper shell.
Authorities said the bikers were traveling about 120 mph on Highway
101, south of San Jose.
   The motorcycle driver, David Cordova, 28, of Gilroy, was taken by
helicopter to San Jose Medical Center for treatment of broken bones
and internal injuries. His condition was not available immediately.
   Cordova faces a felony drunken driving charge, said Diane
Muhleman, spokeswoman for the California Highway Patrol.
   His passenger, Gary Lopez of Gilroy, was treated and released.
Neither bike rider wore a helmet.
   Adding a further bizarre twist to the story, Wilson said he
realized after arriving at the hospital that he knew Lopez. Both are
musicians and have performed together.
   ``I can't imagine how they managed to live through that,'' Wilson
said.
   ``I really thought at first that a grenade had been thrown into
the back of my truck and exploded.''

<HEAD>Collegues Left Wondering Why American Nun Was Shot</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Colleagues today puzzled over
why a gunman in a pickup truck fired on a vehicle carrying three
churchwomen, seriously wounding an American nun.
   Sister Mary Stanislaus MacKey, 73, suffered a shattered cheek
bone when she was shot Wednesday evening, said the Rev. Ken Myers, a
fellow Roman Catholic Church worker. He said she may lose sight in
her left eye.
   The nun, who was at Policlinica Hospital, had regained
consciousness and communicated with others by writing notes, her
colleague said.
   An American plane today is to fly her to Houston where her order,
the Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word, is based, Myers said
in a telephone interview.
   Sister MacKey, a native of Ireland, is a naturalized U.S.
citizen. She had worked in Central America since 1963 and in El
Salvador since 1983.
   Witnesses and authorities say one of several men in a pickup
truck opened fire on another pickup truck that carried Sister MacKey
and two other nuns outside Zaragoza, a town 10 miles south of the
capital.
   Sister MacKey, a registered nurse, worked at a Zaragoza home for
orphans founded by Myers. It shelters about 200 orphans of the
nine-year civil war between leftist guerrillas and the government.
   Sister Ana Maria Brangan, who was driving the pickup with the two
other nuns, said they were approaching Zaragoza from the capital
when a yellow pickup carrying at least six men _ four of them in the
back _ pulled alongside.
   ``They stayed alongside and pulled closer, and I didn't
understand what was going on. Then I heard a noise and thought they
had bumped us. I didn't realize it was a bullet,'' she told
reporters at the hospital.
   She said the other nun, Sister Juana Flores, saw a man standing
in the back fire a single pistol shot.
   She said she stopped the truck, and the attackers stopped just
ahead. However, when she started, they fled.
   ``There were at least six men in the truck and only one weapon.
They may have been thieves. Maybe they were drunk,'' Myers said.
   In 1980, four American churchwomen were murdered by five National
Guard troops, and the United States temporarily suspended aid to the
Salvadoran government in protest.
   The five were convicted of murder and sentenced in 1984 to 30
years imprisonment.
   Extreme rightists and some armed forces officers consider nuns,
priests and other churchpeople who work in poor communities to be
guerrilla sympathizers.
   Myers said his colleagues have not been directly threatened but
have been accused of being leftist sympathizers. ``That kind of
thing happens all the time because of the kind of work we do: the
orphanage, bringing in medicine, a clinic for poor people,'' he said.
   Cpl. Asencio Mejia of the Zaragoza Civil Defense, which is
handling the preliminary investigation, said no suspects had been
found.
   U.S Ambasador William Walker said he will press officials to find
the attackers.

U.S. military spokesman reported today.
   The F-A-18 crashed and sank Thursday shortly after takeoff from
the aircraft carrier USS Midway, which has its home port at
Yokosuka, Japan.
   The aircraft had been conducting a routine training mission over
the South China Sea, about 90 miles west of the Philippine island of
Luzon, the military spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   The pilot, who was not identified, was rescued by a helicopter
from the Midway, the spokesman said. He was not injured.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar dropped sharply against the Japanese
yen today, while the Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index rose
moderately.
   The dollar ended trading at 140.35 yen, down 1.05 yen from
Thursday's close of 141.40 yen. After opening lower at 139.60 yen,
the currency traded between 139.40 yen and 140.60 yen.
   Shigeru Tamaki, a senior currency dealer at the Industrial Bank
of Japan Ltd., said the dollar was ``well bidded above the 140-yen
level,'' though it fell briefly below 140 yen in early trading.
   ``The dollar will remain firm for the time being,'' Tamaki said.
   On the stock exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which
shed 20.31 points Thursday, gained 205.74 points, or 0.61 percent,
to end the week at 33,530.71.
   Dealers said the market's main index gained broadly, encouraged
by the relative stability of the dollar-yen exchange rate.
   ``With the stability in the exchange rate, investors gained
confidence in a broad range of stocks,'' Tamaki said.
   Among major winners were shipbuildings, shippings, constructions
and basic material-related issues. The volume traded in the first
section totaled 750 billion shares, up from Thursday's 550 million
shares.

<HEAD>Woman Found Guilty Of Killing Couple, Snatching Baby</HEAD>

   A woman was convicted of killing a couple to
steal their 9-day-old son, and the victims' family will be satisfied
whether she is sentenced to death or life in prison without parole,
a family spokesman said.
   The Kent County Superior Court jury that convicted Joyce Lynch on
Thursday was to begin deciding between those two possible sentences
today.
   Mrs. Lynch was convicted of killing Joseph and Beverly Gibson,
snatching their infant son Matthew and trying to pass him off as her
own.
   ``We're satisfied that at this point, for the rest of her life,
she won't hurt anybody else. She won't murder anybody else,'' said
the Rev. Kenneth Valentine, a spokesman for the Gibson family.
   Valentine said family members would not comment on whether they
had a preference for punishment.
   The state is seeking the death penalty. Delaware has seven men on
death row. The last woman executed was May H. Carey, who was hanged
June 7, 1935.
   Mrs. Lynch, 36, and her 27-year-old husband, Richard, stalked the
Gibson couple for at least a week before gunning them down at their
mobile home on Christmas Eve 1987, the prosecution said in closing
arguments after 16 days of testimony.
   The Lynches have accused each other in the slayings, and are
being tried separately. Lynch faces trial in September.
   They were each charged with two counts of murder, two counts of
felony murder, one count of conspiracy, and one count of possession
of a deadly weapon during the commission of a felony, burglary and
unlawful imprisonment.
   When the Lynches were arrested on Jan. 7, 1988, they had Matthew,
whom they claimed was Richard Lynch III. Police found them by
tracing telephone calls from their Houston home to the Gibson's.
   Mrs. Lynch claimed her husband controlled her by injecting her
with overdoses of a painkiller she needed for a back ailment. She
said she thought the killings were a dream until her husband told
her they had actually killed the couple.
   The prosecution, however, contended Mrs. Lynch was the mastermind
and duped her husband into thinking she was pregnant. The
prosecution said she knew she had a hysterectomy in 1978 and could
not have children. She has two children from a previous marriage.
   Gibson, 32, was found in a pool of blood by his then-5-year-old
daughter, Rebecca, and 1-year-old son, John Gregory.
   Mrs. Gibson, 27, was found slumped over the steering wheel of her
car, clutching the cloth diaper she used when burping Matthew.
   Matthew and his brother and sister have been raised by their
paternal grandparents.

<HEAD>Casinos Ponder Liabilities From Drunken Gamblers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE A. VENEZIA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge's ruling that casinos
may be held liable for money lost by drunk gamblers could give
customers an easy way to reclaim large gambling losses, casino
executives said.
   ``Every idiot in the world will be suing us,'' Roger Wagner, the
Claridge Casino Hotel president, said Thursday after U.S. District
Judge Mitchell Cohen's ruling.
   Casino operators, like tavern owners, have a responsibility to
their customers, the judge wrote in his decision.
   ``Maybe we have to put Breathalyzers at the door,'' Wagner said,
only half joking.
   Nevada casino executives were concerned about the judge's
decision, too.
   ``Are they suggesting that we administer a drug-alcohol test to a
patron before we let him gamble?'' said Roy Galyean, president of
the Union Plaza Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
   But some casino executives believe the decision reinforces what
the gaming halls already do.
   Jim Wise, spokesman for TropWorld Casino and Entertainment
Resort, said: ``The judge uses such terms as `obviously' and
`visibly' intoxicated. We already follow those guidelines. Anyone in
that state is neither allowed more alcoholic beverages or the
opportunity to gamble.''
   Stephen Hyde, chief executive for Donald Trump's two casinos in
Atlantic City, said, ``It is not in our best interests to have a
drunk sitting at a gaming table making a fool of himself.''
   Trump's casinos will stop serving an intoxicated customer, he
said.
   Wagner said cocktail waitresses who stroll casino floors will ask
customers if they want any complimentary coffee, juice or soda. ``We
do not solicit free alcoholic beverages,'' he said. ``But if a
customer says he wants a beer instead of juice, he can have it.
   ``Casinos are the best whipping boy. They're so visible and
exciting,'' he said. ``You know, Johnson &amp; Johnson makes drugs. If
someone took too many, should they be held accountable?''
   Wise said many gamblers will not drink alcoholic beverages
``because it dilutes the decision-making process.''
   Lois Szabo of New Brunswick, sipping a pina colada at Trump Plaza
Hotel and Casino Thursday, concurred. She said she and most casino
customers ``are more interested in gambling than drinking. You get
so caught up in the slots that you actually forget to take a drink.''
   But some customers might take advantage of the decision ``because
some people would do anything to sue,'' Ms. Szabo said.
``Personally, everybody should be able to control themselves with
liquor. When some people drink excessively, they should be
responsible for their own actions.''
   The judge's decision, issued Wednesday, stemmed from a lawsuit
between a casino and a customer who lost $200,000. Shmuel Aboud of
New York said casino officials plied him with free alcohol and
painkillers for his aching back.
   The ruling will allow a court case to continue toward a finding
of whether the casino was responsible for Aboud's losses.
   Gus Sunday of Philadelphia, who visits Atlantic City's casinos
about twice a month, said he has never seen a fellow gambler
intoxicated.
   ``Anybody who would get drunk has his own problems. It's not the
casino's problem,'' he said. ``People who come to Atlantic City are
not kids. They should have enough sense to know when to say no.''

   A lava flow that destroyed a visitor
center at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park is no longer an imminent
threat to an ancient Hawaiian temple, a park spokesman said.
   The wooden visitor center burst into flames late Thursday
afternoon after molten rock from erupting Kilauea Volcano crept
beneath the raised structure, said park spokesman Jon Erickson.
   Firefighters on Hawaii Island had pumped more than 18,000 gallons
of water onto the lava flow in a futile effort to save the building,
Erickson said.
   It would cost about $60,000 to replace the building that housed
an information office, museum and restrooms, he said.
   Park officials had feared the lava would next claim the temple,
called the Waha`ula Heiau, which was built in 1275 and sits on a
bluff 50 yards south of the center.
   But the lava, some 25 to 30 feet below the temple, was moving to
the west, posing no immediate danger to the temple, Erickson said.
No other structures are in the flow's path, he added.
   The eruption began Jan. 3, 1983, from a vent 2,000 feet up
Kilauea and seven miles from the visitor center.
   Lava from the eruption has destroyed 68 homes, including four
last month in the lava-ravaged Royal Gardens subdivision above the
visitor center.
   Meanwhile, the world's most active volcano continued to pump out
half a million cubic meters of lava per day, said Reggie Okamura,
chief of operations at the U.S. Geological Survey's Hawaiian Volcano
Observatory.

<HEAD>Judge Agrees to Seek Outside Jury in Cottam Case</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) _ A judge has granted defense motions to
look for jurors from another county for the trial of a couple
accused of starving their son to death.
   ``A fair trial is impossible at this time in Luzerne County,''
Judge Gifford S. Cappellini said Thursday. ``Because of the nature
of the pretrial publicity, virtually every prospective juror in
Luzerne County was exposed to it.''
   Defense attorneys for Larry and Leona Cottam renewed their calls
to seek jurors outside the county after 14 potential jurors were
dismissed during the eighth day of jury selection on Wednesday.
   The Cottams face third-degree murder charges in the Jan. 3 death
of their 14-year-old son, Eric.
   Authorities said the Cottams allowed their two children to go
without food for 42 days rather than spend more than $2,130 in cash
set aside as a religious tithe. The Cottams and their 12-year-old
daughter, Laura, were hospitalized for malnutrition.
   The nine jurors who had been picked from among 82 prospects were
dismissed Thursday morning by Cappellini.
   The state Supreme Court will decide what county the jurors will
be chosen from, Cappellini said.
   The Cottams continue to be held in the Luzerne County
Correctional Facility in lieu of $50,000 bail. Their daughter was
placed in a foster home.
   If convicted of third-degree murder, the Cottams would face a
maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. They also have been charged
with two counts each of recklessly endangering another person and
endangering the welfare of children.

<TEXT>
   A jury was chosen for the trial of two
former PTL aides of Jim Bakker after a judge asked potential
panelists if they contributed to a church or recognized luxury
brands like Cartier and Mercedes-Benz.
   Twelve jurors and four alternates were selected Thursday to hear
the trial of David Taggart, 32, and his 35-year-old brother and
housemate, James.
   They are accused of not paying $494,000 in income taxes from 1983
to 1987 and of using more than $1.1 million of PTL money to pay
personal bills, including $55,000 for purchases from the Cartier
jewelry store in New York.
   The trial, scheduled to begin July 5, will be a prelude to the
August trial of Bakker and Richard Dortch. The two former PTL
leaders are accused of diverting more than $4 million in PTL money
for their own benefit.
   David Taggart went to work at PTL in 1978 as an administrative
assistant to the television ministry's music director and soon
became Bakker's most trusted aide. According to PTL records, he drew
more than $620,000 in pay in the 15 months ending March 1987, when
Bakker resigned in a sex and money scandal.
   James Taggart received nearly $300,000 during that period, when
he was PTL's interior decorator.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter asked some potential jurors if
they contributed regularly to a church or a religious organization.
He also asked if they were familiar with brand names such as Gucci,
Jaguar, Cartier and Mercedes-Benz. He then asked if they buy
clothing and jewelry in discount stores or expensive shops, and if
they normally pay with cash, credit cards or checks.
   It was not known whether any prospective jurors were excluded on
the basis of their answers to those questions.

<TEXT>
   A confessed murderer was put to death
today by lethal ejection for the slayings of two men he thought were
homosexuals.
   Sean Patrick Flanagan, 28, had refused to seek appeals of his
death penalty for the 1987 killings in Las Vegas. One of his victims
was dismembered.
   After he was strapped to a gurney at the Nevada State Prison,
Flanagan lifted his head and told the man who prosecuted him, ``I
love you.'' He was declared dead at 2:09 a.m.
   Flanagan was the fourth person put to death in Nevada and the
114th nationally since the 1976 U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowing
states to resume use of the death penalty. He was the second person
executed this week in Nevada.
   Before he died, Flanagan also told Deputy Clark County District
Attorney Dan Seaton, ``You are a just man.''
   ``He has said it before,'' said Seaton, who witnessed the
execution. ``He means it in terms of Christian love and
forgiveness.''
   A last-minute bid by the American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada
to intervene in his behalf was rejected late Thursday by Gov. Robert
Miller.
   ``I'm paying my debt to society,'' Flanagan said in an interview
Wednesday. ``If I had to live, I'd live. I do not have that choice.''
   ``Every man who has committed a crime of murder knows deep down
inside he should die for taking another man's life,'' he said.
``These men have no right to life.''
   Flanagan apologized to the families of his victims for ``the
horrible burdens I've put in their lives. I hope they'll understand
my execution is proper and just.''
   Flanagan said he became involved in homosexual activity while in
the Marines.
   ``I'm just as wicked and nasty as Ted Bundy. I believe if I had
not been arrested, I would have ended up being another Ted Bundy
against homosexuals,'' said Flanagan.
   Bundy was executed earlier this year in Florida after admitting
to the serial killings of women throughout the country.
   But Flanagan said he is no longer violence-prone. ``After giving
my life to Jesus, I couldn't hurt anybody again,'' he said.
   Flanagan provided a rambling seven-page statement in which he
said he hated his homosexuality. He said it was difficult for him to
determine what made him kill homosexual men, but ``the thought that
I would be doing some good for our society crossed my mind.''
   Flanagan spent Thursday with family members and a minister, said
Warden Pete Demosthenes.
   The first of his victims befriended him, bought him some clothes
and got him a room, Flanagan said. James Lewandowski, a 45-year-old
chef, was strangled and dismembered. The body parts were put in
plastic bags and tossed into a trash bin near the motel. The remains
were never recovered.
   Four days later, he said he strangled pianist Albert Duggins, 59,
after Duggins offered him a ride and Flanagan concluded the man was
homosexual.
   Flanagan was arrested in Orange, Calif., for jaywalking shortly
after Duggins' death and voluntarily returned to Las Vegas where he
led detectives to the man's body in a vacant lot.

   Two forest fires were burning out of control and
endangering towns after scorching more than 220,000 acres on the
eastern Soviet island of Sakhalin, Tass reported today.
   ``During 33 years of work on Sakhalin, I have never encountered a
catastrophe of such scale,'' a forestry officer identified only as
N. Kopeikin told the official news agency.
   Tass said the fires had brought Sakhalin, a 500-mile-long island,
``to the brink of an ecological catastrophe.''
   Firefighters, including parachutists, have been sent from several
Soviet cities with special equipment. However, they have been unable
to control the fires, which broke out June 8, according to the
Communist Party daily Pravda.
   The worst fire has destroyed 197,600 acres. Another has charred
24,700 acres. The two fires are spreading toward one another, Tass
said.
   It said one town, Val, is preparing for evacuation, and flames
are approaching the village of Piltun.
   Pravda and Tass indicated natural causes are not suspected.
   ``Very often fires are caused by people who discard cigarette
butts and matches in the forests'' despite government warnings, Tass
said.
   Pravda blamed the forest industry for carelessness.

   The Defense Ministry today denied that 13
men arrested in China on charges of promoting the pro-democracy
movement were spies for Taiwan.
   The ministry said in a statement that the accusations were
China's ``conventional way of framing people with false charges
rather than a fact.''
   Communist China announced the arrests Thursday. It said the 13
men, all Chinese nationals, were recruited by military intelligence
officers of Taiwan's Nationalist government or by local agents.
   China's national television news showed videotapes of some of the
accused men mixing with demonstrators during pro-democracy rallies
in Beijing before the June 3-4 military crackdown. The television
also showed secret codes, letters and invisible ink it said were
used by the men.
   Taiwan's mass-circulation China Times quoted an unidentified
Nationalist intelligence officer as saying that, although Taiwan
maintains agents on the mainland, they long ago stopped using secret
codes and invisible ink.
   Nationalist legislator Chien Han-sheng said China intended to
``divert mainland people's anger and indignation'' over the
crackdown by putting the blame for the turmoil on Taiwan.
   The Chinese Nationalist government fled to Taiwan following its
1949 defeat by communist forces in a civil war.
   The Nationalists remain technically at war with the communists
but recently adopted a more flexible policy that allows visits
across the strait separating the two nations and trade through third
countries.

   Rain fell in much of the nation today and caused flooding in
western New York after flash floods in Pennsylvania led to the
drowning death of a disabled woman.
   Early morning showers and thunderstorms extended today from
Oklahoma across Wisconsin into western Indiana, and across northern
parts of the Virginias and from Georgia across Florida.
   A state of emergency was declared for Genesee County in western
New York, where heavy rains washed out parts of some roads and left
some elevated railroad bridges in danger of collapsing. Roads also
were washed out or closed by flooding in three other counties. At
Arcade, 3{ inches of rain fell Thursday evening.
   Flood watches were posted through the morning in much of the
central and southern Appalachians and a large part of western New
York.
   Heavy thunderstorms in southeastern Pennsylvania unleashed flash
floods that stranded rush-hour commuters Thursday and led to a freak
drowning accident, authorities said.
   Linda J. Sanford, a 22-year-old woman with cerebral palsy, was
sitting in her family room at her home in Holland when the room
filled with about 2{ feet of water, said Detective Ken Barnes of the
Northampton Township Police Department. She apparently fell into the
water and drowned, Barnes said.
   Rain soaked parts of Alabama again Thursday, with thunderstorms
downing trees and power lines in Chilton, Cullman and Talladega
counties. Birmingham's suburb of Leeds received nearly 1.7 inches of
rain.
   Rain that flooded farmers' crops and inundated homes has caused
at least $2 million in damage in east-central Alabama, officials
said Thursday.
   More harsh weather also hit Georgia Thursday afternoon, with
lightning sparking at least three house fires in Gwinnett County,
one of which injured four firefighters when a roof collapsed on them.
   A Fire Department spokesman said the firefighters were taken to
Gwinnett Medical Center, where they were treated and released.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
in much of the Gulf Coast, Florida, the southern and middle Atlantic
Coast and the upper Great Lakes; and showers and thunderstorms in
central Oklahoma, the middle and upper Mississippi Valley and the
northern and central Rockies.
   Predicted highs: 60s in eastern Colorado, the northern Rockies
and parts of the Pacific Coast; 90s in Florida, southern Georgia,
the Gulf Coast, much of Texas and southern Oregon; 100s in the
desert Southwest and inland valleys of California; and 70s and 80s
elsewhere.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 34
degrees at Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming to 90 at Blythe,
Calif.

<HEAD>Hungary Party Meeting Opens Amid Calls for New Party Chief</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Central Committee of Hungary's
deeply split Communist Party met today as some progressives called
for the replacement of centrist party chief Karoly Grosz.
   The state news agency MTI in a terse report announced only that
the meeting had started and that the committee was working on
preparations for a party congress this fall.
   On Thursday, the reform-minded speaker of parliament, Matyas
Szueroes, appeared to lend his voice to calls from other reformers
inside the ruling party for a replacement of Grosz. He took up the
post of party general secretary 13 months ago.
   Szueroes did not criticize Grosz by name. But, according to MTI,
he said the Communist Party could only work for national integration
``if the reform wing unambiguously takes the upper hand and the key
positions are filled by ... popular and intelligent leaders of the
reform wing.''
   Szueroes' remarks followed calls from at least five party reform
groups for Grosz's ouster and a caretaker leadership under
reformers' control until the fall congress.
   The central ground that Grosz tried to stake out has eroded as
the divisions between reformers and more orthodox Communists become
increasingly evident.
   Imre Poszgay, a minister of state and Politburo member who is the
country's leading Communist reformer, said Thursday that the
113-member, policymaking Central Committee would be told to keep
Grosz on as party leader until the congress.
   But he said anything might happen given the fluid situation in
Hungarian politics.
   Democratic reforms have advanced rapidly since Grosz became party
leader in May 1988.
   This week, the Communists and democratic opposition groups agreed
to work out plans for multiparty elections.
   A week ago, Imre Nagy and once reviled fellow leaders of the
failed 1956 uprising against Stalinism were buried after a
nationally televised mourning ceremony attended by Pozsgay, Szueroes
and up to a quarter of a million Hungarians.

   Yosef Yehudai, the police chief of Jerusalem,
died today of a heart attack, officials said. He was 42.
   The Romanian-born Yehudai emigrated to Israel in 1961 and has
served with the paramilitary border police and regular police since
he was 17 years old.
   Yehudai, appointed commander of police forces in Jerusalem three
years ago, has confronted frequent outbreaks of violence in the
disputed city since the Palestinian uprising broke out in December
1987.
   The soft-spoken, pipe-smoking Yehudai was often seen commanding
his forces during Palestinian stone-throwing clashes with police in
east Jerusalem, annexed by Israel after the 1967 Middle East war.
   Yehudai is survived by his wife, who is also a police officer,
and two daughters.
   Funeral arrangements are incomplete.

   Two detectives distributing a sketch of a subway
vigilante known as the ``Remember Me?'' gunman couldn't believe
their eyes _ or their luck _ when they found themselves face-to-face
with the suspect.
   Transit police detectives Sonia Pinckney and Gregory Bellatone
were handing out copies of the sketch near the scene of the June 10
shooting Thursday morning when they spotted a man leaning on a car
who matched the sketch perfectly, police spokesman Al O'Leary said.
   Pinckney turned to Bellatone and said: ``Do you see what I see?''
   When the detectives approached the man and handed him a copy of
the sketch, he said, ``It's like looking in a mirror.''
   Police identified him as Clemente Jackson, 21. He said he didn't
know anything about the attack but the detectives took him into
custody for questioning, O'Leary said.
   The district attorney's office is expected to charge Jackson with
either attempted murder or first-degree assault, O'Leary said.
   The alleged gunman had been robbed of a gold chain and gold
bracelet at a subway station on June 9. The next day, he happened
upon his alleged robbers at a nearby subway station, said ``Remember
me?'' and opened fire with a 9mm gun. Three people were wounded,
none seriously.
   One of the shooting victims positively identified Jackson,
O'Leary said.
   Three people have been charged in the robbery, included David
Godbole, 24, and Dantay Smith, 16, who were shot in the thigh. A
14-year-old whose name was withheld because of his age also has been
charged with the robbery.

   Millions of households are expected to face
higher water bills because of new federal rules that are designed to
make water safer to drink, says the Environmental Protection Agency.
   The EPA announced new regulations Thursday which will require
local water authorities serving an estimated 150 million people to
rid drinking water of a variety of germs that are annually blamed
for 90,000 illnesses, including diarrhea, nausea and upset stomachs.
   About a third of the nearly 10,000 water systems subject to the
new requirements will have to install new filtration equipment or
make other expensive adjustments over the next four years to comply
with the federal requirements.
   In many cases local authorities will be given up to four years to
install the equipment required by the new federal water standards,
said EPA spokesman Dave Ryan.
   The communities that already use filtration as a way of
decontaminating their drinking water may have to make other, less
costly, adjustments such as improving their chemical treatment
procedures, the agency said.
   The EPA estimated the new requirements will cost $3 billion
overall for initial equipment and add about $500 million a year to
operating costs. These costs are expected to be passed on to water
customers.
   The increases in household water bills are likely to vary widely
depending on the size of the public water system and whether the
system already has some filtration equipment. In some cases
compliance to the regulations will require modest adjustments, while
others will need entirely new filtration systems.
   In communities where water systems serve fewer than 500 customers
and where no filtration is now used, household water bills could
increase as much as $30 to $50 a month, the EPA estimated. The
increases in urban areas where the cost may be more widely
distributed are likely to be about $6 a month or less if some
filtration equipment already is being used, the EPA said.
   ``These rules are a major step forward in providing maximum
protection for our nation's drinking-water supplies,'' said EPA
Administrator William K. Reilly.
   The regulations, which apply only to communities where drinking
water comes from surface sources such as rivers and streams, are
aimed at reducing the risk of illness from microscopic living
organisms such as viruses, bacteria and protozoa.
   The EPA estimated Americans are subjected to tens of thousands of
illnesses annually from such waterborne germs and that those
estimates might be low because such illnesses often go unreported or
are not linked to water contamination.
   The agency said estimated 90,000 such illnesses could be avoided
each year because of the improvements.
   The EPA said more than 21 million people get water from systems
that use no filtration, including residents of Boston, New York
City, Newark, N.J., San Francisco and Seattle.
   Other cities listed by the EPA as not filtering their drinking
water were Portland, Maine; Syracuse and Utica, N.Y.; Scranton,
Bethlehem, and Wilkes-Barre, Pa.; Greenville, S.C., Reno and Sparks,
Nev.; Tacoma, Wash., and Portland, Ore.

   In a summer school program that could
really take off, students filled tissue paper balloons with hot air,
built gliders and rigged eggs with parachutes to learn the mysteries
of flight.
   ``It's really not like school,'' said Julie Taylor, a 9-year-old
sky school cadet. ``It's fun because you get to make your own
airplanes and balloons and fly them.''
   Taylor was one of 100 fourth- through 11th-graders who postponed
their summer break for one week to participate in the NASA-inspired
program.
   It was to end today with a hot-air balloon contest and a
soft-landing competition, in which students will try to drop a
one-pound package containing an egg and suspended from a parachute
from a second-story window, without breaking the egg.
   ``My first attempt was a complete disaster, basically,'' said
Marcel Malfregeot, 13, as he proudly displayed his entry _ a small,
white box wrapped in bubbly plastic packing material.
   ``This time I've got a box inside of a box and the egg is totally
surrounded by oatmeal, which is a good shock absorber.''
   Other cadets launched brightly colored gliders or compared models
of real aircraft they built.
   ``Each one of the students has been in the cockpit of an airplane
and learned how to work the controls,'' said Thelma Nutter, a
kindergarten teacher who spent a week at NASA's Sky School in
Orlando, Fla., to prepare for the program.
   Students from 10 counties in north-central West Virginia
participated in the program.
   ``The only problem, as I see it, is that it wasn't long enough,''
said Bob Beckwith, a Randolph County science teacher. ``We had
enough material left over to run the school for another 10 days.''

   As about 50 onlookers yelled in protest,
seven members of the Revolutionary Communist Youth Brigade set fire
to six miniature American flags at the University of California.
   There was no violence when a 3-by-5 inch and five postage-stamp
size flags were burned on Thursday, one day after the Supreme Court
ruled 5-4 that states cannot enforce laws against burning the
American flag.
   Dean Tuckerman, a self-described anarchist who was not part of
the demonstration, also burned a tiny paper American flag stuck on a
toothpick.
   ``I think it's important to burn flags,'' Tuckerman said. ``I'm
in favor of burning that red flag they're carrying, too, and my
black flag of anarchy. They're just symbols. They're not sacred.''
   As the demonstrators stomped on the burned remains, onlookers
yelled ``Get real!'' and ``Let's talk about Stalin.''
   ``This makes me angry,'' said Michael McCormick, 39, a Vietnam
veteran. ``Americans fought and died for the flag.''
   Demonstrator Chila Morris said she wanted to ``put the flag on
trial against mindless flag-waving.''
   The American flag ``is the flag that flew over slave ships, that
flew with the cavalry that shot Indians,'' she said. ``Now it stands
for U.S. domination of the Third World.''
   John Spahr of Punxsutawney, Pa., said he was delighted his family
encountered a demonstration while visiting Berkeley.
   ``This demonstration's what the flag and this country are all
about,'' he said after his son suggested that the deomonstrators
should be gagged. ``I'm glad my boy got to see this.''

   A team of U.S. burn specialists returned to Moscow
today after helping Soviet officials treat victims of a gas
explosion that engulfed two passenger trains in flames three weeks
ago.
   At least 600 people died in the June 4 inferno when a spark from
a railroad electrical line ignited a highly flammable mixture of
benzine and propane-butane gas that leaked from a pipeline in the
Ural mountains near the city of Ufa. About 800 passengers were
hospitalized with severe burns.
   The team of about 30 specialists from the Institute of Surgical
Research at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas,
carried out 26 skin grafting operations at Ufa's burn center,
according to Dr. Lisa Walker, a team surgeon.
   ``We took care of two intensive care wards and a surgical ward
for less critically burned patients,'' Ms. Walker said at a news
briefing. ``Overall we took care of approximately 80 to 90 victims.''
   She said the U.S. team included three surgeons and support
personnel who worked hand-in-hand with Soviet physicians. They
brought seven tons of special surgical equipment and left most of it
behind in Ufa, Ms. Walker said.
   The burn center team, composed of military doctors, nurses and
technicians, was sent to Ufa after President Bush went to the Soviet
Embassy in Washington to offer condolences to the blast victims and
proposed sending U.S. experts to help survivors.
   ``Our flight team was on standby and ready to be deployed at any
time,'' Ms. Walker said. ``It was easy to mobilize us.''
   She said all of the 26 surgical patients treated by the U.S. unit
were now in stable condition.
   Ray Keith, a medical operations officer, said Soviet treatment of
the blast victims was more than adequate.
   ``I was impressed by the distribution of patients, the equipment
and technology,'' he said. ``They treated the patients very well.''
   Ms. Walker said the team would return to Texas on Sunday.
``Overall it was a very good experience for all of us,'' she said.
   The burn center at Brooke Army Medical Center is the only U.S.
military facility for burn treatment. The burn teams are on standby
to fly anywhere in the world and were used extensively during the
Vietnam War to transfer patients from the battlefield to Japan for
treatment.

<HEAD>Baby Sitter Says Hurt Referred to Jennings as His Wife</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAMUEL MAULL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former baby sitter joined witnesses testifying
that actor William Hurt called Sandra Jennings his wife, but none
has referred to the four weeks on which the former ballerina is
basing her claim for a common-law marriage.
   Linda Patrick testified Thursday that she and Hurt went to lunch
with Hurt's and Jennings' son, Alexander, in the summer of 1985.
   ``How do you like working with my wife?'' she quoted Hurt as
asking.
   However, the value of Patrick's testimony isn't clear. State
Supreme Court Justice Jacqueline Silbermann, who is hearing the case
without a jury, has said what matters is what happened in South
Carolina during four weeks between Dec. 9, 1982, when Hurt learned
that his divorce from actress Mary Beth Hurt was final, and the time
he and Jennings left the state, Jan. 19, 1983.
   South Carolina recognizes common-law marriages; New York does not.
   Jennings is seeking to have the court declare she and Hurt are
married so she can get a divorce and a share of his assets,
estimated by her lawyer, A. Richard Golub, to be about $10 million.
   Jennings, 32, says Hurt introduced her to people in Beaufort,
S.C., where he was filming ``The Big Chill,'' as his wife. But no
testimony or other evidence has been offered to support that
assertion.
   Earlier in the day, Dr. Barbara Ann Barker, who was Hurt's
ophthalmologist and the wife of one of the actor's lawyers,
testified she was unable to explain why Jennings' name was whited
out of a space marked ``spouse'' on one of her office records while
the copy of the record had Jennings' name.
   ``I did not, to my knowledge, white it out,'' Barker replied to a
question by Golub. The lawyer tried to suggest the document was
altered after Jennings sued Hurt.
   The witness also testified that she had never heard Hurt refer to
Jennings as his wife. She said he did hear him say, ``This is the
mother of my child.''
   The civil trial is scheduled to resume Monday.

   A court found K mart partially
responsible for injuries suffered by a customer who shot himself in
the toe while examining a rifle he wanted to buy for his 6-year-old
son.
   Palm Beach Circuit Judge Edward Garrison ruled that K mart was
negligent in the June 1987 accident because a clerk handed Richard
Rubin the gun without checking to see that it was loaded. The judge
awarded Rubin $10,419 on Thursday.
   The jury originally awarded Rubin $16,000, but found he was 35
percent negligent, reducing the corporation's liability to 65
percent.
   Rubin, 29, of Boca Raton, said he went to a K mart in Boynton
Beach to buy a .22-caliber semiautomatic rifle when he pulled the
trigger and shot himself in the toe. The gun was to be a first-grade
graduation present for his son.
   ``I was shocked when it went off,'' said Rubin, who owns more
than 25 guns.
   He sued for $200,000, claiming disfigurement and business losses.
   An employee testified that company policy required guns to be
unloaded. Witnesses were unable to say how the gun came to be loaded.

   Two cargo ships collided in heavy fog off
northwestern Spain today and one sank, killing one sailor and
injuring two, a navy official said. Rescue workers were searching
for five missing crew members.
   The Cypriot-registered Lady Rhoda had eight sailors aboard when
it sank after colliding at 3 a.m. with the Moroccan vessel Melouiya
12.5 miles off the port of Cabo Silleiro, a Spanish navy official
said.
   Two Lady Rhoda sailors were slightly injured, one died and the
other five were missing, said the official, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   He said there were no injuries among the eight crewmen of the
Melouiya. Authorities towed the ship to Vigo, where its damaged prow
will be rebuilt.
   Two Spanish air force helicopters, two Spanish navy patrol boats,
a Portuguese navy vessel and several Red Cross launches were
searching in foggy conditions for the missing sailors, he said.
   The Lady Rhoda, a 500-ton, 165-foot vessel, was hauling wood from
Suez to the British port of Rochester, the official said. Portuguese
news reports said it left the northern Portuguese port of Leixoes on
Thursday night.
   The official said the Melouiya was roughly the same size as the
Lady Rhoda.
   The Melouiya reportedly was headed for Morocco with a cargo of
iron and chemicals it picked up in the Spanish port of Bilbao.

   Paynai Sirirat, a senior Thai border official, said Peter L. Pond
of Providence, R.I., was shot in the leg by a Cambodian from the
Site 8 camp, located on the Thai-Cambodian frontier. The official
could not confirm whether the guman was a Khmer Rouge soldier.
   Pond was taken to a Bangkok hospital where a nurse said he was in
the emergency room for X-rays. She declined to give more details,
saying the U.S. Embassy had asked the hospital not to talk with
reporters about the case.
   Sirirat said Pond and the gunman quarreled before the shooting.
He said the argument might have been over Pond's work at the camp.
   Pond is a Protestant minister who has worked with Cambodian
refugees and adopted several Cambodian children.
   He helped Cambodian Buddhist monks build a temple at the refugee
camp and planned to set up a Buddhist school.
   Jim Anderson of the International Rescue Committee, which also
works with Cambodian refugees, said he had heard Pond was shot by a
Khmer Rouge soldier in the leg while just south of the camp.
Anderson said his information was sketchy and ``not firsthand.''
   Site 8 is south of the Thai border town of Aranyaprathet and
houses nearly 40,000 refugees. They are followers of the Khmer
Rouge, one of three guerrilla groups fighting the Vietnamese and the
Phnom Penh government in Cambodia.
   Pond has been closely associated with a charismatic Cambodian
Buddhist monk, Maha Ghosananda, who has sought to unite the warring
parties in Cambodia.
   Ghosananda heads The Cambodian Mission for Peace, which Pond
helped found and organize. Both men attended recent peace talks to
end the civil war in Cambodia and urged all factions to reconcile
their differences.
   The ultra-leftist Khmer Rouge ruled Cambodia in the 1970s and
killed hundreds of thousands of people in a drive to return to a
primitive agrarian society. Vietnam invaded Cambodia in 1979 and
ousted the Khmer Rouge.
   The guerrillas claim they have renounced their radical ways, but
Western aid organizations, human rights groups and others say their
is mounting proof the Khmer Rouge remains a ruthless force.

<HEAD>Kazakh Government Addresses Rioters' Complaints; New Disturbances
Reported</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of the republic of Kazakhstan promised
today to solve social and economic problems fueling riots that have
killed four people in an isolated city. New disturbances were
reported.
   The official Tass news agency said Kazakhstan's Council of
Ministers set up a commission to outline improvements for Novy Uzen,
a city of 56,000 people where arson and other attacks began last
weekend.
   Pravda reported that six people tried to seize a gas compressor
station in the area on Thursday and that many workers in Novy Uzen,
where the four people died, were staying away from work.
   The Communist Party daily said only a quarter of the city's
factory and office employees showed up for work Thursday. Only a
bakery and food shops operated normally, Pravda said.
   The rioters have demanded that all members of Caucasus ethnic
groups be evicted from Novy Uzen. More than one-third of the
population is from the Caucasus.
   Native Kazakhs complain the Caucasus settlers dominate the oil
industry jobs on which the city depends and receive preferential
treatment in housing and other benefits.
   The rioters also complain the settlers have set up private
businesses that sell supplies in the desert city for exhorbitant
prices.
   Tass said cooperatives found guilty of abuses would be closed. It
did not detail what other measures would be taken but quoted deputy
Premier Oktyabr I. Zheltikov as saying that rapid development of the
oil and gas industry had led to shortages of housing and food in
Novy Uzen.
   The social-economic package under consideration recalled similar
pledges authorities made to quell rioting in another region of
Central Asia, the Fergana Valley of Uzbekistan. An Uzbek government
commission on Monday outlined plans to create 200,000 jobs, clean up
polluting factories and grow more food in the valley, where rioting
in late May and early June against minority Meskhi Turks killed 100
people.
   Tass reported today that a legislative commission in Moscow would
be set up to investigate the Meskhi Turks' problems.
   The attack on the Novy Uzen compressor station was carried out at
3 a.m. Thursday by six people wielding metal rods and a rifle,
Pravda reported. It said all six were detained.
   Pravda said other attempts have been made to disrupt the town's
water, electricity and a gas processing plant.
   A curfew was imposed in the town after the rioting began, and
foreign reporters have been barred from the region.
   ``A mass attack is being conducted now on autotransport
enterprises, and calls for sabotage are ringing out,'' Pravda said.
   At one transport business, a driver was quoted as saying his
colleagues did not show up for work because they feared attacks.
   Uzbekistan's Communist Party chief was replaced today, but there
was no indication the move was related to the unrest.
   Tass said Rafik N. Nishanov was relieved as Uzbek party first
secretary because he had been appointed head of one of two chambers
of the Supreme Soviet legislature in Moscow. Nishanov heads the
Soviet of Nationalities, which reviews problems of the Soviet
Union's more than 100 national groups.
   The Uzbek party's Central Committee, meeting in the republic's
capital, Tashkent, elected Islam A. Karimov, a regional party chief
in the republic, to replace Nishanov, Tass reported.
   It was the third change in a Soviet republic's leadership in two
days.
   Gennady Kolbin was let go Thursday as party chief in Kazakhstan
so he could devote full time to his new job as chairman of the
People's Control Committee, a watchdog operation over government
ministries, Tass reported.
   The new Kazakh party chief is 49-year-old Nursultan Nazarbayev,
premier of Kazakhstan since 1984.
   Also Thursday, the president of Azerbaijan, Suleiman Tatliyev,
retired ``at his request'' and was replaced by Elmira Kafarova, Tass
said.

   A pilot program by seven local McDonald's
restaurants to determine if customers will separate recyclable trash
has been labeled a success.
   McDonald's and the Polystyrene Packaging Council, a national
trade and lobby group, wanted to know whether customers would
separate plastic items for recycling.
   At a news conference Thursday, Susan Ferris, the council's Oregon
spokeswoman, said the program worked. The program had customers drop
plastic utensils, straws and hamburger containers into bins marked
for recyclables.
   In the McDonald's program, 300 to 400 pounds of plastics have
been carted away three times a week by recyclers, according to Bruce
Holser of Denton Plastics.
   Ferris said Portland was chosen for the pilot project because
many residents are environmentally conscious. ``We have a willing
community,'' she said. She said she didn't know how long the program
would be continued.

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police are conducting spot checks
of cars and vans approaching Frankfurt's airport as part of
increased security measures imposed after a recent threat of a
terrorist attack, an official said today.
   West German officials this month stepped up police protection at
the airport _ continental Europe's busiest _ after receiving a tip
that Palestinian terrorists were planning to attack an airline
flying out of Frankfurt.
   Frankfurt Airport has been especially crowded recently as foreign
tourists begin to flood Europe and as West Germans start leaving on
summer vacations.
   Some security experts say they believe the bomb that downed Pan
Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December was smuggled on
board in Frankfurt. West German officials deny that.
   A high-ranking West German police official assigned to the
airport detail said today that officers began checking some motor
vehicles approaching the airport terminal at the beginning of the
month.
   ``The stepped-up measures, including the checks of cars and vans,
will stay in effect as long as the security situation is what it is
now,'' said the official, who spoke to The Associated Press on the
condition of anonymity.
   The checks sometimes include searches of automobile trunks, while
police also question drivers and ask to see documents such as the
vehicle registration.
   At one of the two airport checkpoints, police were flagging down
automobiles whose occupants appeared to be of Middle East origin.
The majority of the approaching vehicles were waved through.
   A half-dozen officers, some wearing bulletproof vests and one
carrying an automatic rifle, stood at the checkpoint.
   One of the checkpoints was just 110 yards from the terminal
building on an approach ramp, while the other was 330 yards away on
another approach ramp.
   Other noticeable changes in security included police officers
standing at curbs to ensure drivers moved their cars immediately
after dropping off or picking up passengers.
   Armed police officers are constantly on patrol, while an armored
personnel carrier stands at the corner of the terminal building
alongside the busiest approach ramp.
   Officials have refused to say how many police are patrolling the
airport.
   Christian Jaletzke, a spokesman for the Hesse State Interior
Ministry, told the AP the stepped-up security measures will be in
place ``as long as necessary.''
   Jaletzke, whose ministry oversees police functions in Frankfurt
and elsewhere in Hesse state, said he did not know whether Frankfurt
is the only European airport checking approaching motor vehicles.

   Stanford University has agreed to return
the bones of more than 500 Indians to the Ohlone-Costanoan people
for reburial.
   Indians, who consider ancestral remains sacred, have praised the
move announced Wednesday, following followed five years of
negotiations between the university and the Ohlone tribe. But some
anthropologists say it is a blow to medical research.
   Stanford is ``giving the Indians the right to decide'' whether to
take possession of the remains or allow delays for further research,
Stanford archaeologist Barbara Bocek said.
   Once the Indians take charge of the remains, she said, it would
be assumed that they would be reburied and gone forever from
research.
   The decision is up to the Ohlones, she said, and ``if they came
today for the bones'' they would be returned.
   Rayna Green, a Cherokee scholar and author from Washington, D.C.,
said she knew of no other formal agreement like the one between
Stanford and the Ohlones.
   ``It's really extraordinary,'' she said. ``I'm deeply admiring of
what Stanford is doing.''
   ``The decision to support reinterment has been difficult,''
Provost James Rosse wrote to the elders of the Ohlones.
   In Washington, the chairman of the anthropology department of the
Smithsonian Institution said researchers have made important strides
recently in analyzing proteins in Indian remains that could help
medical researchers in the study of bone and joint diseases.
   ``From a scientific standpoint, it's a very bad move,'' Donald
Ortner told The Washington Post. ``There is going to be a terrible
price to be paid down the road.''
   Bocek said most of the remains involved come from California's
Ryan Mound in Fremont and the Castro Mound in Mountain View. Most
were acquired by Stanford scholars as far back as the turn of the
century.
   ``Indians feel an extremely great sense of continuity with their
ancestors over generations,'' she said. ``The tradition of respect
and responsibility for their elders, including those who died long
ago, is still a very vital part of the culture.''
   Rosemary Cambra, a representative of the Ohlones, said she was
``very, very happy Stanford has agreed to respect the religious
rights of the Indians.''

<HEAD>Using Connections to Get Government Millions OK, Ambassador Says</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS new 14th graf, When she, to include background on earlier
testimony by Pierce and Ms. Dean.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The leader of a group of former federal housing
officials says there was nothing wrong with using their connections
to get millions of government dollars for apartment projects they
were developing.
   ``Is it unethical for anybody who has been in government to use
the expertise they picked up?'' Philip Winn, now the U.S. ambassador
to Switzerland, asked following his testimony Thursday before a
congressional panel. ``I don't see anything unethical.''
   Winn, who was an assistant secretary of HUD for a year before
making an unsuccessful run for the 1982 GOP gubernatorial nomination
in Colorado, led a group that won HUD funds for several projects in
the West and Southwest. In tax credits alone, those projects got
some $29 million from the federal government.
   Asked if he and his partners used their influence with the agency
to their advantage, Winn replied: ``It may very well be the case.''
   ``I don't believe my partners willfully disregarded any rules or
regulations,'' he added.
   Among Winn's other partners were Silvio DeBartolomeis, former
general deputy assistant secretary for housing; J. Michael Queenan,
the former director of HUD's Denver regional office; and Lance
Wilson, a former executive assistant to then-HUD Secretary Samuel
Pierce Jr.
   Winn was greeted skeptically by members of the House Government
Operations subcommittee on employment and housing when he said no
rules were broken and that competition wasn't squelched.
   ``If it is your purpose to show how that is not the way things
worked, you have a tall order, Mr. Ambassador,'' said Rep. Tom
Lantos, D-Calif., the subcommittee's chairman.
   Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., also criticized Winn: ``You're
really out of touch.''
   One of Winn's partners was Philip Abrams, who had been HUD
undersecretary _ the second-highest post in the department.
   Earlier, Abrams told the panel that his position at HUD _ which
he likened to being vice president of the United States _ rarely
gave him operational authority and that some of those functions had
been handled by Deborah Gore Dean, who followed Wilson as executive
assistant to Pierce.
   In testimony before the panel, Ms. Dean has been identified time
and again as the key individual within the department whose support
was needed to get increasingly scarce government funds to pay
developers for fixing up and running housing projects for the poor
and the elderly.
   Her wide-ranging but unofficial authority, as well as Pierce's
detached management of the department, have become focal points of
the investigation into allegations of influence peddling at HUD.
   When she appeared before the subcommittee a few weeks ago, Ms.
Dean invoked her constitutional right against self-incrimination and
refused to testify. Pierce's testimony before the panel in May at
times became a shouting match as the former secretary tried to
defend his role at the department and members of Congress accused
him of trying to deflect blame.
   Abrams testified that before leaving HUD in 1984, his
relationship with Ms. Dean was cordial but became strained on
occasion.
   He said it flared up ``on one occasion when she thought that I
had sidestepped her.''
   But he said they became more friendly after he quit the
department and went into partnership with Winn.
   On two occasions in 1986, Abrams sent hand-written notes to Ms.
Dean, both addressed ``Dear Debbie,'' seeking HUD funding for
projects in Oklahoma and Nevada. Both projects got the money.
   The subcommittee on Thursday also heard from Joseph Strauss, a
former special assistant to Pierce who received $1.3 million in
consultant fees in connection with 13 moderate rehabilitation
projects.
   After leaving HUD to go into private business, Strauss hired
former Interior Secretary James Watt on a retainer to help get money
from the department.
   ``The reason was because of his access and his influence,''
Strauss said of his decision to retain Watt. ``I don't want to make
any bones about that.''

<HEAD>Thatcher-de Klerk Meeting Causes Protests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 60 anti-apartheid demonstrators protested
in London today while Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher met with a
politician who will become South Africa's next president in
September.
   Police said seven demonstrators were arrested at a protest
outside the South African Embassy and one was arrested outside Mrs.
Thatcher's home, where she met with F.W. de Klerk, leader of South
Africa's governing National Party.
   Mrs. Thatcher said after her meeting that she believed there was
a ``new mood'' in the racially segregated nation.
   ``It was evident that there is a ... greater determination to
resolve the great issues of the day through negotiation,'' said a
statement issued by her office. ``Our hope ... is that these new
opportunities will be grasped and there will be an end to violence.''
   A protester splattered white paint on De Klerk's blue Jaguar as
he arrived at Mrs. Thatcher's residence and tried to rush toward the
car.
   Police overpowered three protesters who broke from a group of 15
holding banners near a security barrier about 40 yards from Mrs.
Thatcher's front door.
   Robert Hughes, chairman of the Anti-Apartheid Movement, said Mrs.
Thatcher should not engage ``in a process of dialogue with the
apartheid regime.''
   Outside the South African Embassy, 50 demonstrators banged drums
and blew whistles in a daylong protest. Some banners described de
Klerk and Mrs. Thatcher as ``fascists.''
   Others said ``Free Mandela Now,'' referring to black leader
Nelson Mandela, who has been in prison since 1964 serving a life
term for sabotage and trying to overthrow the South African
government. Mrs. Thatcher's statement said she had pleaded with de
Klerk to release Mandela.
   The statement also said she reiterated that she will not talk
with South African groups that practice violence, indicating she
will continue to refuse meetings with representatives of Mandela's
African National Congress guerrilla movement.
   At a news conference at the South African Embassy, De Klerk made
no reference to Mandela but said he and Mrs. Thatcher agreed ``about
the need for continued discussion and interaction between the two
governments.''
   De Klerk is to replace President P.W. Botha in September.
   He called the news conference but then refused to answer
questions, saying he had to get to an appointment with Foreign
Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe.
   De Klerk said he discussed with Mrs. Thatcher South Africa's
position on ``constitutional development'' and ``the negotiation
process.''
   He appeared to be referring to the white-led government's so
unsuccessful attempts to get black leaders to enter constitutional
talks.
   South Africa's apartheid system denies the nation's 28 million
blacks a vote in national affairs. The white minority of 5 million
controls the economy and maintains separate neighborhoods, schools
and health services.
   Mrs. Thatcher is the West's most outspoken opponent of imposing
economic sanctions on South Africa to pressure it to end apartheid.
She contends such sanctions cost jobs, including in Britain, hurt
South Africa's black majority most and harden white resistance to
change.
   De Klerk met in Bonn on Thursday with West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl. The South African leader also will visit Italy,
Portugal and Switzerland.

   Another foreign youth flying a
single-engine Cessna swooped out of the Western sky into Soviet
airspace today, but this one was met with children and flowers
instead of police and a jail cell.
   Tony Aliengena, an 11-year-old from California, arrived in
Leningrad this morning. His flight was approved well in advance,
unlike that of Mathias Rust, who spent 14 months in a Moscow prison
after evading Soviet air defenses and landing in Red Square two
years ago.
   Tony, from San Juan Capistrano, sent a letter to President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev in May 1988 asking permission to fly across the
Soviet Union, otherwise closed to foreigners, on a ``friendship
flight.''
   Thirteen months and $150,000 in expenses later, he landed in
Leningrad with an entourage including his parents and sister, a
documentary film crew, a 10-year-old Russian pen pal, a publicity
agent, Soviet and American journalists and a world-record observer
to verify his attempt to become the youngest person to pilot a plane
around the globe.
   After touching down in Leningrad under clear skies, the
fourth-grader looked nervous but sounded nonchalant.
   ``What do you have to say to Soviet children?'' he was asked by a
crowd of reporters upon exiting his red, white and blue Cessna 210
Centurion turboprop.
   ``I say want to say `hi,''' the scrubbed, crew-cut youth said
with a shrug.
   ``Do you want to be an astronaut?'' asked another reporter.
   ``No, I want to be a brain surgeon,'' he replied.
   Tony's Soviet host, Gennady Alferenko, director of the Foundation
for Social Invention in Moscow, was not so relaxed.
   Alferenko said Soviet Defense Ministry officials were at first
horrified by Tony's flight plan because of the memory of Rust, a
19-year-old West German whose aerial escapade in a single-engine
Cessna led to the retirement of Defense Minister Sergei L. Sokolov
and the firing of the chief of Soviet air defenses. ``You mean it's
the same kind of plane?'' Alferenko quoted the ministry officials as
saying.
   ``Tony will show all the Soviet Union what it means _ the freedom
to fly,'' Alferenko said. ``Now a Siberian boy will think, `Why do I
have to stay in this village in Siberia? I live in the whole world,
and I went to see it, to fly by balloon or cross the Bering Strait
by kayak.'''
   Alferenko's foundation is financing the Soviet portion of Tony's
trip.
   It is also untangling red tape so Tony can make 14 stops in the
Soviet Union, mostly in isolated Siberian towns. The Soviet route
will enable him to cross the Pacific Ocean on a short hop across the
Bering Strait to Alaska, and then head home.
   The price for the Soviet portion of Tony's flight is $70,000,
including $10,000 for landing rights alone.
   Tony will fly to Moscow on Monday where he hopes to present a
friendship scroll signed by 250,000 American children to Gorbachev.
Tony said he still doesn't know if he will get to meet Gorbachev.
   Tony began his flight June 5 in California.

<HEAD>Energy Department Agrees to Release Records of Nuclear Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHERINE RIZZO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Department of Energy has decided to allow
outside scrutiny of health records of 600,000 people who have worked
on government nuclear projects over the past four decades, Sen. John
Glenn, D-Ohio, said today.
   The decision is a dramatic policy reversal for the agency, which
has been fighting a Freedom of Information Act request for the data
filed by the Three Mile Island Public Health Fund, a group created
after the accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in
Pennsylvania.
   Glenn, who for several years has been investigating problems in
the government's nuclear weapons complex, began pressing for the
release of the data two months ago.
   He said he asked for the health records because of ``the growing
controversy over the conflicts of interest between the DOE's dual
roles of promoting radiation technologies and assessing their health
impacts.''
   The medical information dates back to the early 1940s, when the
government began work on the Manhattan Project to develop the atomic
bomb. It includes records of workers at about 50 government
facilities, and is considered the world's largest body of
information on the effects of radiation exposure.
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins said he ordered the department
to establish a national repository for ``all epidemiologically
relevant information on DOE workers.'' That central data base would
cost $4.5 million, The Washington Post reported in today's editions.
   The department also awarded the National Academy of Sciences a
$250,000 contract to ``develop a mechanism'' for giving ``qualified
researchers'' access to the raw files before the central data base
is ready, the newspaper said. Researchers should be able to start
reviewing the files in a few months, the Post said.
   Energy Department spokesmen did not immediately return a
telephone message seeking comment on the new policy.
   In the past, the department has refused to release the records on
the ground it was barred under privacy laws and agreements with
state health agencies. The National Academy of Sciences' job will be
to find a way to overcome those impediments.
   Glenn praised Watkins in a statement for ``assuring that these
studies will no longer be hidden behind the shroud of secrecy.''
   ``The DOE is taking a first positive step to make this research
part of the broader public health domain,'' he said.

<HEAD>Palestinian Killed In Settler Raid</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jewish settlers armed with machine guns raided a
town in the occupied West Bank today, killing a Palestinian with a
shot to the head and wounding another, Arab villagers said.
   An army spokeswoman confirmed a Palestinian was killed in the
village of Qarawat Bani Zeit but said the circumstances were under
investigation. Nine West Bank settlers were detained in the village
for questioning, she said.
   A second Palestinian reportedly was shot and killed in clashes
with troops after Moslem noon prayers in the West Bank town of
Hebron. The army spokeswoman said she was checking the report.
   The deaths brought to 530 the number of Palestinians killed in
the 18-month Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of the
West Bank and Gaza Strip. Twenty-three Israelis also have been
killed.
   The reported raid on Qarawat Bani Zeit was the latest in a series
of settler attacks on Arabs in recent weeks.
   The attacks have intensified since last week's slaying of
Frederick Steven Rosenfeld, a U.S.-born settler who was stabbed to
death. Three Palestinians were arrested in the slaying.
   Qarawat Bani Zeit is four miles southwest of Ariel, the West
Bank's largest Jewish settlement with 8,000 residents. Rosenfeld
lived in Ariel before being killed.
   Fathi Refai, a Qarawat Bani Zeit resident, said in a telephone
interview that about a dozen armed settlers entered the village on
foot this morning.
   A confrontation ensued with dozens of stone-throwing youths, and
the settlers shot to death 20-year-old Aziz Khamis Yousef Arar,
Refai said. He said Adnan Yousef Arar, 14, a relative of the slain
man, was wounded in the leg.
   The elder Arar was buried immediately, Refai said. The army
spokeswoman said troops arrived in the village after the funeral.
   Arar is the first Palestinian to be killed in a clash with
settlers since last month when Jewish seminary students from the
West Bank town of Nablus stormed the village of Kifl Harith and
fatally shot a 13-year-old girl.
   In Hebron, troops today shot 19-year-old Ayman Taher Muhtasseb in
the neck during stone-throwing clashes after prayer services, Arab
reports said.
   Muhtasseb arrived dead in a Hebron clinic of the Red Crescent,
the Moslem equivalent of the Red Cross, a Red Crescent official said.
   Also today, a Jerusalem court sentenced a Palestinian to life in
prison for stabbing to death two elderly Israelis and wounding three
last month, Israeli media reported. The defendant, 28-year-old Nidal
Zalum from the West Bank town of Ramallah, allegedly belonged to
Islamic Jihad, a Moslem fundamentalist group opposed to Israel's
existence.
   The stabbing deaths were the bloodiest Palestinian assault in
Jerusalem's Western Jewish sector since the uprising began in
December 1987.

<HEAD>Justice Department Must Supply Magazine with Trial Court Opinions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department has a legal obligation
to supply a weekly tax magazine with copies of all federal trial
court opinions and orders in tax cases, the Supreme Court ruled
today.
   The justices, by an 8-1 vote, said the federal Freedom of
Information Act imposes such a duty on the Justice Department's tax
division.
   Government lawyers, warning of ``enormous administrative costs
and burdens'' at taxpayer expense, had urged the high court to rule
that the 1966 law aimed at curtailing government secrecy does not go
that far.
   Tax Analysts, a Washington-based weekly magazine reporting
legislative, judicial and regulatory development in federal
taxation, first invoked the FOIA in 1984 in seeking timely copies of
federal court opinions and orders from the Justice Department.
   Such opinions and orders are available to the public from the
individual courts but the magazine had difficulty in obtaining them
quickly.
   The Justice Department's tax division turned down the magazine's
FOIA request, and a federal judge upheld the denial.
   But the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here last year ruled that
the government must comply with the FOIA requests, and today's
decision upheld that ruling.
   Government lawyers estimate that complying with the Tax Analysts
requests on a regular basis will cost nearly $75,000 a year for
search time alone.
   They had told the court that commercial publishers and law firms
would flood the Justice Department with similar requests if the
appeals court ruling were not overturned.
   But writing for the court today, Justice Thurgood Marshall said
Justice Department officials ``improperly withheld agency records''
as defined by the FOIA.
   Only Justice Harry A. Blackmun dissented, saying, ``It seems to
me that the lnguage of the statute is not that clear or conclusive
on the issue and, more important, because the result the court
reaches cannot be one that was within the intent of Congress when
the FOIA was enacted.''
   The case is U.S. Justice Department vs. Tax Analysts, 88-782.

<HEAD>L.A. Police Chief Disciplines 38 Officers in Violent Drug Raid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirty-eight police officers are being
disciplined and some could be fired after inner-city residents filed
a civil rights lawsuit saying their homes were vandalized and they
were terrorized during a drug raid.
   ``This is not something I do with any joy at all,'' Chief Daryl
Gates said during a news conference Thursday. ``But clearly, the
situation got out of control. The officers were trying very hard to
do the right thing _ to solve the gang problem, to solve the
narcotics trafficking problem. Unfortunately, while doing the right
thing, they were doing it in the wrong way.''
   A drive-by shooting involving gang members prompted the raid by
88 officers Aug. 1. Police officials later determined that during
the raid, walls and plumbing fixtures in four homes were smashed and
some residents were beaten and humiliated.
   Nine officers have been ordered to appear before department Board
of Rights tribunals and face firing or long suspensions from duty
without pay, Gates said. Twenty-five others agreed to suspensions of
22 days or less without pay.
   Three other officers had letters of reprimand placed in their
files, and a captain has been reassigned to another job at a lower
salary, Gates said.
   The 38 were charged with violations ranging from lying to
department investigators to damaging personal property.
   In addition, two officers also involved in the raids have
resigned, and another was fired for an unrelated rules violation,
police officials said.
   Police seized crack cocaine, marijuana and a sawed-off rifle
during the raid, Gates said. Of 32 people taken into custody, nine
were arrested.
   The lawsuit, filed in federal court by some of the 32, alleges
they were forced to whistle the theme song from the old Andy
Griffith television show and run a gantlet of officers at the police
station. It also says that officers spray-painted walls of the homes
with such anti-gang slogans.

<DATELINE>GBADOLITE, Zaire (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of U.S.-backed rebels in
Angola and the nation's Marxist president have agreed to a
cease-fire in the civil war that has ravaged Angola since it gained
independence 14 years ago.
   As part of an accord worked out at a summit in Gbadolite, rebel
leader Jonas Savimbi will go into exile, according to President
Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia, a participant at the summit.
   ``I was not born to make war at all costs,'' Savimbi said
Thursday after the cease-fire was announced. ``Even if I have made
war until now for precise reasons _ and even if these reasons cease
to exist _ I will always remain, in my skin, a citizen of Angola.''
   The cease-fire, which goes into effect at midnight Saturday, left
details of the peace agreement to be worked out in later
negotiations between Savimbi and President Eduardo dos Santos.
   ``We've taken the first step,'' dos Santos said after he returned
to Luanda, Angola today, the Portuguese news agency LUSA reported.
``The future will tell. But at least we're all acting in good
faith.''
   Kaunda said: ``I want to believe that going by what took place at
Gbadolite, there is no doubt at all that the reconciliation is real.
It is genuine.''
   Kaunda said the decision to go into exile was Savimbi's. ``He
hasn't told us where he will be going, but he will be going out of
Angola,'' said Kaunda, chairman of the six-nation African Frontline,
which includes Angola.
   The summit was the first meeting between dos Santos and Savimbi
since civil war broke out in 1975 shortly after the Portuguese
colony gained independence. There have been tens of thousands of
casualties since.
   Savimbi heads the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola, known as UNITA, which has fought to share power with dos
Santos' Popular Liberation Movement of Angola.
   The peace agreement was called the Declaration of Gbadolite, a
town 400 miles northeast of Kinshasa, Zaire's capital. Savimbi and
dos Santos sealed the accord with a handshake.
   About 20 African leaders attended the one-day summit, sponsored
by the Organization of African Unity.
   The agreement came after a U.S.-brokered regional peace accord
was signed in New York in December. South Africa, which backed
Savimbi, agreed then to grant independence to Namibia and halt aid
to UNITA in exchange for the withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops
backing dos Santos' government.
   Angola, Cuba and South Africa signed that accord, but UNITA was
not a party to it.
   The summit adopted an eight-point declaration, drafted by
President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire.
   In Washington, the assistant secretary of state for African
affairs, Herman Cohen, said Thursday that the United States ``helped
develop'' the Zaire summit.
   Moussa Traore, president of Mali and chairman of the Organization
of African Unity, said in closing the summit: ``This brotherly
handshake between Dr. Jonas Savimbi and President dos Santos
symbolizes the end of civil war in Angola, which will open up a new
era ... devoted to economic and social development.''
   Angola, twice the size of Texas with only 8 million people, has
oil, diamonds, minerals and fertile agricultural land, but the civil
war has seriously disrupted the economy.
   Most of Savimbi's support comes from the rural southern area. The
northern city and coastal area form Dos Santos' power base.
   It was not clear if Savimbi would play a role in the
reconcilation process. Kaunda said Savimbi promised to abide by a
previous agreement to personally stay out of peace negotiations,
according to the Portuguese news agency LUSA.
   Savimbi said last month that he would not demand a role in a
transitional government if democratic elections were held within two
years.
   Dos Santos agreed to ``the formation of a government of national
unity, though a policy of national reconciliation, a comprehensive
amnesty program, and the reintegration of UNITA members and all
other Angolans outside the present political system into the
mainstream, including the armed forces,'' according to the
semi-official Zimbabwe Inter-African News Agency.
   On Thursday, dos Santos commuted the death sentences of 50
rebels, Angola's official ANGOP news agency reported. On Wednesday,
the government released 700 rebel prisoners who accepted an amnesty,
it said.
   A commission headed by Mobutu will be set up to supervise the
national reconciliation There was no immediate word on where and when the
national
reconciliation talks would begin and who would participate.

<TEXT>
   Israeli troops and allied militiamen
backed by helicopter gunships today launched attacks on pro-Iranian
guerrillas in southeast Lebanon, outside Israel's self-proclaimed
security zone, police said.
   Israeli army officials denied their troops were involved and said
their militia allies, the South Lebanon Army, carried out the
``initiative actions.''
   Hezbollah, or Party of God, Iran's main Shiite Moslem ally in
Lebanon, said in a statement its guerrillas suffered ``a number of
casualties, killed and wounded'' in the three-hour attack that began
at 11 a.m.
   Police said about 300 Israeli troops and militiamen of the South
Lebanon Army in 35 armored personnel carriers moved up for the
assault behind an artillery barrage, with backing from three Israeli
helicopter gunships.
   The attackers fought their way into the villages of Kawkaba,
Dellafeh, Kfar Houna and Mydoun, three to four miles north of the
security zone in the Syrian-controlled western Bekaa valley, police
reported.
   They blew up several houses in a search for Hezbollah guerrillas,
said a police spokesman who cannot be named under standing
regulations. He said it was not known if any guerrillas were
arrested.
   Israeli officials said the force made sweeps for guerrillas and
weapons south of Mydoun and returned safely early in the afternoon.
   The attack occurred two miles south of the Syrian army's front
lines in the Bekaa valley. The Syrians took no part in the
hostilities, the police spokesman said.
   Israel carved out the security zone when it withdrew the bulk of
its invading army from south Lebanon in the summer of 1985 after a
three-year occupation.
   The 6-to-10-mile deep enclave, a buffer against guerrilla attacks
on northern Israeli settlements, is patrolled by the Israeli army
and the SLA.

   A transient with a history of sleeping
in big trash bins was found dead after he was scooped up by a
garbage truck crew.
   An autopsy performed Thursday to determine the cause of death was
incomplete, which means the man could have been dead before he was
hoisted into the truck, said Los Angeles County coroner's spokesman
Bob Dambacher.
   The man's body was covered with cuts and bruises but didn't
appear crushed, although he had been tossed into the truck's trash
compactor, which can exert more than 17,000 pounds of pressure per
square inch, said police Lt. Ellis Smith.
   The man probably failed to awake when the trash hopper at a
storefront district on Sepulveda Boulevard was picked up
mechanically Wednesday morning and upended over the cargo bay of the
garbage truck.
   But Culver City sanitation manager Mark Gauerke conceded the
possibility that the hydraulic lifts could have drowned out the
homeless man's screams.
   Authorities withheld the 41-year-old man's name early today
because his family had not yet been notified.
   ``He had a history of wrapping himself up in carpets and sleeping
in dumpsters,'' Ellis said.

   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen has rejoined three clubs he
quit last summer after being picked as the Democratic vice
presidential nominee, his spokesman said today, contending that the
clubs have no membership restrictions.
   Bentsen has rejoined River Oaks Country Club, the Middleburg
Tennis Club in Middleburg, Va., and the Ramada Club of Houston,
spokesman Jack DeVore said. The Houston Post, which first reported
the senator's decision in today's editions, said officials at two of
the three say their groups have no black members.
   ``The clubs have no membership restrictions,'' said DeVore. ``A
number of Senator Bentsen's associates have told him they thought it
would be appropriate for him to rejoin.''
   When Bentsen resigned from the clubs last August, DeVore said he
did so because he believed it was ``the appropriate thing to do.''
He belonged to both Houston clubs for 25 years before resigning.
   W.R. Steger, River Oaks manager, said the club still has no black
members but has several Hispanic members. Sandy Myers, assistant
manager at the Middleburg club, said no blacks have applied for
membership.
   Ramada Club manager John Divernois has described the membership
of his goup as ``mixed.'' It is a downtown business luncheon club
founded in 1939.

<TEXT>
   A European weather satellite will be moved west
to gather images of the entire south Atlantic Ocean and help fill a
gap left by a failed U.S. satellite, the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration announced today.
   Officials said the European satellite, called METEOSAT 3, will be
moved to a point at 50 degrees west longitude over the Atlantic. The
move is expected to be completed by next October.
   Gene Legg, staff meteorologist at NOAA's satellite service
center, said that from its new location METEOSAT 3 will be able to
view weather patterns as far west as Colorado and as far east as the
Atlantic coast of Africa.
   ``This will be very helpful during the hurricane season,'' Legg
said. The European satellite will be able to detect developing
hurricanes earlier than the U.S. weather satellites, he said.
   The United States has had two satellites, called GOES, positioned
to gather weather images of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans and all
of this country. But last January, an imaging instrument failed on
the GOES 6 satellite, which was positioned to photograph the Pacific
and the western United States.
   To compensate, NOAA has been making the GOES 7 satellite do
double duty. GOES 7 was positioned at 108 degrees west longitude in
the winter and then moved to 98 degrees west in the spring to
monitor the Atlantic hurricane season.
   With the assistance of the European satellite, Legg said it will
not be necessary to seasonally move GOES 7. This should prolong the
lifetime of that satellite, he said, since it uses less fuel while
stationary.
   The United States plans to launch a new GOES satellite in July
1990.
   Legg said data from the European METEOSAT 3 will be beamed to
stations in Europe for processing and then retransmitted to weather
agencies on both sides of the Atlantic. He said this relay will
delay images about half an hour compared with the time required to
receive pictures from GOES 7.
   Images from the European satellite also will look slightly
different than those from GOES 7. Legg said that since METEOSAT 3
will be over a more easterly point than was GOES 7, the images as
seen on television screens will show less of the United States.
   The coast of Florida, for instance, will be farther to the left
of the projected image than it is in views taken by GOES 7.
   By moving the METEOSAT 3 west, the Europeans return a favor to
the U.S. weather service. From 1985 to 1988, NOAA repositioned the
GOES 4 satellite over the eastern Atlantic in order to fill a gap in
weather monitoring created when an earlier METEOSAT failed.

   Chris George devoted more than a decade to
helping Palestinian refugees in the Middle East. Now, Palestinian
militants are being blamed for his abduction.
   George, co-director of the Save The Children Federation in
Jerusalem, was seized Thursday and released today after about 30
hours.
   George knows how to survive and even make things happen in the
complex and often tumultuous Middle East. He is fluent in Arabic
after earlier postings in Oman and Lebanon. Friends know him as a
man who can be called for help at any time, day or night.
   Because he and his wife lived in a Palestinian community in the
West Bank, they were more affected by the 18-month uprising than
many foreigners who live in Israeli cities.
   Frequent strikes closed the local market. A boycott of
Israeli-made goods declared by underground leaders had the Georges
asking friends for recipes on how to make butter and yogurt at home.
   On Thursday, the turmoil of this part of the world overwhelmed
George like never before.
   The 35-year-old, from Montclair, N.J., was kidnapped in Gaza
City, and the Israeli army blamed ``terrorists linked to the PLO.''
Palestinian sources said handwritten letters demanded Israel release
Palestinian prisoners in exchange for his freedom.
   George was the first foreigner kidnapped in Israel or the
occupied areas since the 1967 Middle East conflict, according to the
Foreign Ministry.
   George is no stranger to detention. On May 24, Israeli soldiers
seized him in a raid on the Al Amari camp in the occupied West Bank,
where he lives, and held him several hours. The soldiers finally
realized he was an American and set him free.
   George was especially upset that the soldiers entered his home
with M-16 automatic rifles.
   ``We do not allow weapons in my home, and I certainly did not
want my children to see them,'' he said.
   George lives with his wife, 34-year-old Elizabeth Webb, and their
two daughters, 4-year-old Susannah and 2-year-old Rosalind, in an
apartment house overlooking the camp on the outskirts of Ramallah.
   He told the The Associated Press that during his detention, he
tried to make sure Palestinians held by the soldiers at the camp
were well treated.
   He complained, however, that ``if anyone talked, they were
shouted at or kicked.''
   George said that when he saw a soldier kick a Palestinian in the
side, he told the soldier ``that isn't necessary'' and was told
``shut up.''
   The relief official began work overseas with the Peace Corps in
Oman in the 1970's.
   Before and after Israel's 1982 invasion, he lived and worked in
the Ein Hilweh camp outside Sidon, Lebanon. The camp had a large
civilian population but also served as a base for Palestine
Liberation Organization guerrilla groups.
   George helped Palestinian families readjust and rebuild after
Israeli shells and bombs devastated the camp in the 1982 war.
   Foreigners left the Lebanon office of Save the Children after a
series of kidnappings by Shiite Moslem radicals made the country
unsafe for Westerners. When the Israeli army last month began
restricting movement of Gaza workers into Israel, George told The
Associated Press he would survey the strip to see if the 700,000
Palestinian residents needed more projects to improve their
self-sufficiency. He was on a field trip Thursday when he
disappeared.

<UNK>Women Protesting Uno Geisha Scandal Reportedly Scuffle With Supporters</UNK>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A scuffle broke out today between supporters of
Prime Minister Sousuke Uno and women who say he should resign
because of allegations he kept a mistress, a news agency reported.
   Uno was speaking at a campaign rally for a candidate running for
the Tokyo assembly when the confrontation occurred, the Kyodo News
Service said.
   Several members of the governing Liberal Democratic Party shouted
insults at women who carried placards saying ``A prime minister who
buys sex is a national disgrace'' and ``We don't need a prostitution
premier,'' the report said. Kyodo quoted one of the women as saying
a party member shoved a Japanese flag at her after several placards
were pulled down.
   No one was injured, and police reported no arrests.
   Party officials could not be reached for comment tonight. Kyodo
said one official had apologized for the scuffle.
   A Tokyo police official said he had no knowledge of the scuffle
but that women carrying placards with anti-Uno slogans held a march
before Uno arrived and attended the rally. About 3,000 people
attended the rally, said the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Women's groups across the nation have called on Uno to either
confirm or deny a published report charging that he paid a geisha to
be his mistress for several months in 1985.
   Uno, who is married, has refused to comment. His took over as
prime minister on June 3 after his predecessor, Noboru Takeshita,
was forced to resign because of the Recruit influence-peddling
scandal.
   The scandal involved dozens of prominent politicians and
businessmen. Prosecutors say the politicians bought stock in a
Recruit subsidiary and then profited handsomely when it went public.
   The Liberal Democrats chose Uno as their leader because of his
clean image. The geisha report surfaced later.

<HEAD>Conservatives Fail to Form Government; Papandreou Asked to Try</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK QUINN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president today asked interim Premier
Andreas Papandreou, who is hospitalized with pneumonia, to try to
form a new government after conservative leader Constantine
Mitsotakis failed to do so.
   There was no immediate comment from Papandreou, who was admitted
to General State Hospital on Thursday. He has until Monday to come
up with a government.
   A medical bulletin today said the 70-year-old Papandreou, who led
Greece eight years until his party lost Sunday's election, was
``receiving the proper medical treatment and will remain in the
hospital.'' Papandreou underwent a triple heart bypass operation in
London eight months ago.
   Mitsotakis told President Christos Sartzetakis today he was
unable to form a government in the three-day constitutional limit.
He blamed the failure on the Coalition of Left and Progress, an
alliance of the Communist and Greek Left parties.
   Sunday's national elections ended without a majority in
Parliament, forcing the country to seek its first coalition
government since the return to democracy in 1974.
   Under the constitution, the president offers the leading party,
Mitsotakis' center-right New Democracy, the first chance to form a
government. Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Movement, or PASOK,
which finished second in the election, gets the second chance,
followed by the Coalition, which finished third.
   ``New Democracy made specific proposals to the Greek political
world and especially to the left. The proposals I made were honest
and went beyond the demands of the left,'' Mitsotakis said at a news
conference after his meeting with the president.
   The conservative leader had appealed to the Coalition to join an
interim government with a mandate limited to rooting out allegations
of corruption and scandal in Papandreou's government.
   He said the government would last only a few months and would
call new elections after carrying out the ``catharsis,'' or
cleansing of Greece's government.
   Mitsotakis met twice with Harilaos Florakis, the president of the
Coalition, in his efforts to reach an agreement.
   ``I have offered two crucial ministries to the left. The ministry
of catharsis _ the Justice Ministry _ and the Interior Ministry,''
Mitsotakis said.
   ``The offer remains open. Our party remains open for discussion,
with the left or anyone else. The catharsis must occur,'' the
conservative leader said.
   Papandreou and most of his socialist Cabinet retained their posts
in a caretaker capacity following Sunday's election.
   New Democracy won 145 parliamentary seats in the vote, seven
short of the number needed for a majority in the 300-seat
Parliament. PASOK won 125 seats and the Coalition 28.
   Mitsotakis said a government must be formed quickly as Greece was
``being shamed internationaly'' following revelations of a new
banking scandal.
   The scandal involves the arrest of 13 executives of the Greek
Mortgage Bank who allegedly laundered about $700 million though its
American braches.
   Papandreou's defeat at the polls came after another bank scandal
involving the Bank of Crete and its chairman, George Koskotas, who
was accused of taking money from the bank.
   Koskotas claimed Papandreou and other members of his government
took some of the money to finance their campaign. Papandreou denied
wrongdoing.

   The Supreme Court today refused to let Congress
totally outlaw the billion-dollar ``dial-a-porn'' industry,
rejecting arguments that such a ban is needed to protect the
nation's children from merely ``indecent'' messages.
   The justices unanimously said Congress was not justified when it
passed a law last year banning all sexually explicit telephone
dial-up message services.
   Congress may outlaw obscene telephone messages only, not indecent
ones, the court said. The dial-a-porn industry therefore must be
allowed to survive, it said.
   The ban violates free-speech rights when applied to ``indecent''
messages, the court ruled.
   An adult magazine's graphic centerfold or a movie love scene that
leaves nothing to the imagination may _ or may not _ be obscene.
That's for a jury to decide. If such material is deemed only
indecent, it is constitutionally protected.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Ruled that states are not required by the Constitution to
provide free lawyers for death row inmates who lost an initial round
of appeals.
   By a 5-4 vote, the court ruled in favor of Virginia officials who
said requiring states to pay for attorneys in second-round appeals
could lead to interminable delays in carrying out executions.
   _ Made it more difficult for older workers to prove that when
some of their benefits are reduced their employers violated a
federal law against age discrimination.
   By a 7-2 vote, the court revived an Ohio pension law provision
challenged by a woman forced to retire because of a disability.
   _ Ruled that the Justice Department has a legal obligation to
supply a weekly tax magazine with copies of all federal trial court
opinions and orders in tax cases.
   The justices, by an 8-1 vote, said the federal Freedom of
Information Act imposes such a duty on the Justice Department's tax
division.
   A 1988 law made it a crime to use a telephone to make any
``obscene or indecent'' communication for commercial purposes. But
its total ban was never imposed because U.S. District Judge A.
Wallace Tashima in Los Angeles ruled it could be applied only to
obscene _ not merely indecent _ phone messages.
   The judge said that outlawing non-obscene messages, even though
they may be inappropriate for minors, violates the free-speech
protections of the Constitution's First Amendment.
   Today, the nation's highest court said the law could be applied
to obscene messages, but not to indecent ones.
   ``Sexual expression which is indecent but not obscene is
protected by the (Constitution's) First Amendment,'' Justice Byron
R. White wrote for the court.
   In an argument session before the justices last April, the Bush
administration urged that the total ban be reinstated.
   Justice Department lawyer Richard Taranto said then that the ban
is needed to ``protect children from hearing patently offensive
speech.''
   But Laurance Tribe, a Harvard law professor representing a
dial-a-porn company, said technological safeguards blocking
children's access to the racy messages make a total ban unnecessary
and unconstitutional.
   In today's decision, White said, ``It may well be that there is
no fail-safe method of guaranteeing that never will a minor be able
to access the dial-a-porn system.''
   But he said technological restrictions on the industry might
prove ``extremely effective, and only a few of the most enterprising
and disobedient young people will manage to secure access to such
messages.''
   The court's three most liberal justices in freedom-of-expression
cases _ William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall and John Paul Stevens
_ voted to strike down the law as it applies to obscene material as
well.
   ``I have long been convinced that the exaction of criminal
penalties for the distribution of obscene materials to consenting
adults is constitutionally intolerable,'' Brennan wrote in an
opinion joined by Marshall and Stevens.
   Dial-a-porn companies make their services available to callers
through 976 exchanges and AT&amp;T's 900 long-distance lines.
   The telephone company typically charges callers according to
per-call rates, retaining a portion of the charges and giving the
remainder to the dial-a-porn company.
   The same exchanges also are used for other, non-controversial
types of messages such as sports scores, time checks and weather
reports.
   Born in 1983, the dial-a-porn industry matured quickly. According
to court records, in 1984 some 180 million calls were placed by
customers in New York alone.
   The industry's income last year topped $2 billion.
   Congress in 1983 directed the Federal Communications Commission
to figure out ways children could be prevented from calling
dial-a-porn services. A company's failure to adhere to those methods
was to be a crime.
   The commission considered various means of restricting access to
sexually explicit messages and eventually settled on access codes,
scramblers and requiring credit card payment.
   But an impatient Congress in 1988 enacted the outright ban.
   Writing for the court, White said, ``Because the statute's denial
of adult access to telephone messages which are indecent but not
obscene far exceeds that which is necessary to limit the access of
minors to such messages, we hold that the ban does not survive
constitutional scrutiny.''
   Obscenity is a legal term that does not apply to all sexually
explicit material.
   The Supreme Court since 1973 had defined obscenity as a work that
appeals to a morbid interest in sex, is patently offensive and when
taken as a whole lacks serious literary, artistic, political or
scientific value.
   Sexually explicit material, often called pornography, may or may
not be legally obscene.
   In 1978, the court drew a distinction between obscene and
``indecent'' expression when it allowed federal regulators to
restrict the broadcast of indecent language.
   Upholding the government's power to punish use of ``dirty words''
carried on television or radio at times when children might be
listening, the court adopted the FCC's definition of indecent _
``patently offensive references to excretory and sexual organs or
activities.''
   After Tashima's decision last July, the Reagan administration
appealed directly to the Supreme Court, challenging that part of the
ruling that protects indecent material.
   Sable Communications of California Inc., a major purveyor of
dial-a-porn services in that state, filed a counter-appeal
challenging the part of Tashima's ruling that allows the ban on
materials judged to be obscene.
   The cases are Sable Communications v. FCC, 88-515, and FCC vs.
Sable Communications, 88-525.

   The Supreme Court today made it more difficult
for older workers to prove that when some of their benefits are
reduced their employers violated a federal law against age
discrimination.
   By a 7-2 vote, the court revived an Ohio pension law provision
challenged by a woman forced to retire because of a disability.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for the court, said to win
her case the woman must prove that the reduced benefits resulted
from ``an intent to discriminate in some non-fringe benefit aspect
of the employment relation.''
   The ruling apparently means that workers charging age bias in
such cases must prove reduced fringe benefits were aimed, for
example, at discouraging older workers from applying for jobs or
were intended to force them to quit.
   Justice Thurgood Marshall, in a dissenting opinion, said the
ruling ``immunizes virtually all employee benefit programs from
liability under the (federal) Age Discrimination in Employment Act
of 1967.''
   He said, ``Henceforth, liability will not attach under the ADEA
even if an employer is unable to put forth any jusitification for
denying older workers the benefits younger ones receive, and indeed,
even if his only reason for discriminating against older workers in
benefits is his abject hostility to, or his unfounded stereotypes of
them.''
   Justice William J. Brennan joined Marshall's dissent.
   The case stems from a challenge to an Ohio law by June Betts, a
former speech pathologist for the Hamilton County Mental Retardation
Department.
   When her work degenerated because of medical problems, Ms. Betts
was given a choice by the state in 1985 of taking unpaid medical
leave or retirement with a standard pension.
   She was barred from receiving more generous disability retirement
benefits because she was 61.
   A provision of the state pension plan allowed disability benefits
only for those who worked for the state for at least five years and
were under 60 when forced to quit.
   Ms. Betts' pension was $158.50 a month under the standard plan,
compared to $355 a month in disability retirement benefits.
   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year upheld a federal
judge's ruling in Ms. Betts' favor that threw out the state's
age-based pension provision.
   The appeals court said the provision violated the federal Age
Discrimination in Employment Act since Ohio officials failed to
prove that giving larger benefits to younger workers is justified by
cost considerations.
   Today's Supreme Court ruling said the state was not required to
prove that for the benefit plan to survive.
   The case is Public Employees Retirement System of Ohio vs. Betts,
88-389.

<HEAD>States Immune from Suits for Monetary Damages by Bankrupt Businesses

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   States are immune from being sued for monetary
damages by bankrupt businesses and individuals, the Supreme Court
ruled today.
   By a 5-4 vote in a Connecticut case, the court said federal
bankruptcy law may not be used to pierce the legal armor the
Constitution gives states.
   In a separate bankruptcy ruling, the court voted 6-3 that
defendants charged by a bankruptcy trustee with fraud are entitled
to jury trials.
   The decision in the Connecticut case was a defeat for Martin W.
Hoffman, a court-appointed trustee supervising payment to creditors
of the Wilington Convalescent Home and Edward Zera, who ran a
maintenance service.
   The nursing home, which shut its doors in 1983, said Connecticut
owed it $64,000 in Medicaid payments for patients it treated.
   ``Congress did not abograte 11th Amendment immunity by enacting
(federal bankruptcy law),'' Justice Byron R. White wrote in the
court's main opinion.
   Justices Thurgood Marshall, William J. Brennan, Harry A. Blackmun
and John Paul Stevens dissented.
   In the second case, the court threw out a $1.6 million judgment
against two Colombian banking corporations won by a bankruptcy
trustee for the Chase &amp; Sanborn Corp.
   In an opinion by Brennan, the court said Granfianciera and Medex
wrongly were deprived of a jury trial when facing allegations that
three money transfers from Chase &amp; Sanborn to them were fraudulent
and could be avoided by the bankruptcy trustee.
   Chase &amp; Sanborn filed for protection under federal bankruptcy law
in Miami in 1983.
   Two years later, bankruptcy trustee Paul C. Nordberg filed a
complaint against the two Colombian corporations.
   A bankruptcy judge awarded the trustee $1.5 million from
Granfianciera and $180,000 against Medex.
   But Brennan's opinion said the award cannot stand because the
Constitution's 7th Amendment guarantees such defendants a jury trial
if they request it.
   Justices White, Blackmun and Sandra Day O'Connor dissented.
   The cases are Hoffman vs. Connecticut Department of Income
Maintenance, 88-412, and Granfinanciera vs. Nordberg, 87-1716.

   Petr Placak, a prominent member of the Czech Children, a
dissident group, was dragged into a police van and taken to a forest
west of Prague, where he was beaten and left behind, according to
friends in Prague.
   The following day, Placak was ordered to appear at state police

   A dog named Master Teddy who inherited his
owner's $102,000 house and fought off her relatives in a courtroom
wrangle won another legal round today _ this time to save his hide
from the tattooist's needle.
   When Celeste V. Crawford died in 1984, her will said Teddy could
live in her Silver Spring home for the rest of his life, with a
friend of hers allowed to live there to look after the dog.
   Her relatives went to court because they didn't want to wait for
the dog's death, but three years ago a judge ruled they cannot
inherit and divvy up proceeds from the house's sale until Teddy dies.
   Fearing another white spitz could be substituted for Teddy, the
six heirs next sought to have a Montgomery County Circuit judge in
Rockville order a veterinarian to tattoo Teddy's hind leg.
   The heirs said the tattoo would positively identify the dog's
body and serve as a safeguard against possible dognapping.
   Today, just as a hearing on their new dispute was to begin,
lawyers for both sides reached an out-of-court settlement that would
enable the dog to be identified after its death without a tattoo.
   Karl G. Feissner, an attorney for the dog's caretaker, said
Teddy's veterinarian had X-rays and photographs that could properly
identify the dog, and the agreement would allow a detailed
inspection of the dog's corpse to satisfy all parties.
   ``Everybody's going to look at this dog _ everybody in the
world,'' Feissner said. Earlier, he had suggested that if the judge
had approved the tattooing, the heirs ``should be tattooed too so we
know who's who.''
   Ralph Gordon, who represents the heirs including Mrs. Crawford's
siblings, had refused to disclose any information about the legal
action. ``We are not going to be the genesis of any publicity on
this case,'' he said.
   Chester A. Anderson, a veterinarian, said in an affidavit that
tattooing was a ``quick, painless and permanent method for
identifying a dog.''
   But K.T. Somaiah, Teddy's veterinarian for the past decade,
argued in court papers against tattooing the 13-year-old dog.
   ``It is not a wise idea to have Teddy tattooed at his age since
it is very traumatic and has to be done under general anesthesia and
hence is not conducive to his health,'' Somaiah said. ``In my
professional opinion, Teddy still has a few more years of good
life.''
   The 60-pound dog had been a constant companion to Mrs. Crawford
until she died of cancer at 77.
   In her will, she also said that her friend, George J. Schnabele,
who's rented the basement apartment since 1968, should be allowed to
live at the house and care for Teddy until the dog's eath. When
Teddy dies, Schnabele, a 74-year-old retired policeman, would have
to leave so the house could be sold.
   Schnabele, who takes the dog to the park daily for exercise, said
he had no idea why the relatives were seeking the tattoo.
   ``If Mrs. Crawford were alive she'd have a fit,'' Schnabele said.

   A U.S. relief worker
kidnapped in the Gaza Strip was freed today and said his captors
gave him a letter urging greater understanding of the Palestinian
situation, especially among Americans.
   Chris George, co-director of the U.S.-headquartered Save the
Children Federation, told reporters he was treated well during his
30-hour captivity.
   ``They were nice to me,'' said George, 35, of Montclair, N.J. ``I
practiced my Arabic during this period.''
   George, who was kidnapped Thursday in Gaza City, showed reporters
a six-page letter he said the kidnappers asked him to deliver to
President Bush. The letter requested that Bush meet with PLO leader
Yasser Arafat.
   The letter also said the kidnapping was not intended to hurt
Americans but was a plea for people across the world, especially the
United States, to understand the plight of the Palestinians and
their need for independence.
   George was released at the U.N. hostel on the beach in Gaza City,
then taken to the Marne House hotel by about 10 Americans from the
U.S. Embassy.
   He walked into the Marne House hotel at about 6 p.m. (11 a.m.
EDT) and shook hands with hotel workers and Palestinian journalists.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Len Lefko said he was ``not aware of any
conditions'' for the release.
   He said George had spoken with U.S. Ambassador William Brown.
``His condition is good ... he told the ambassador he was well and
happy and delighted,'' Lefko said.
   Earlier today, the army blamed his abduction on Palestinian
terrorists linked to the PLO. Palestinian accounts said the hostage
sent letters demanding jailed Palestinian prisoners be set free.
   In Tunis, the PLO denounced the kidnapping and a spokesman said
it was making the ``greatest effort'' to obtain the hostage's
release. It was unclear immediately what role, if any, the PLO
played in George's release.
   He was the first foreigner to be kidnapped in the occupied lands,
said Foreign Ministry spokesman Alon Liel.
   State Department sources in Washington said George was released
into the custody of the Red Crescent, the Arab Red Cross. The
officials, who demanded anonymity, said it was not known who
kidnapped George.
   During the 18-month uprising against Israeli occupation, the
PLO-backed underground in the occupied lands has maintained a policy
opposing the use of arms and exempting foreigners from attacks. The
kidnapping would mark a change of strategy if it was sanctioned by
the leadership. More than 500 Palestinians and 23 Isrealis have been
killed in the uprising.
   After the abduction, the army set up checkpoints and stopped cars
driven by Palestinians in Gaza City, a city of 150,000. Soldiers
conducted searches and declared the 140-square-mile Gaza Strip a
closed military area, barring journalists from entering.
   PLO spokesman Ahmed Abdul-Rahman said in a telephone interview
from Tunisia that the PLO had nothing to do with the abduction and
``denounced completely and thoroughly this capture of an American
citizen who works to help Palestinian children.''
   Khatem Abu Shaaban, a Palestinian official of Save the Children,
said the agency's office in Gaza received a letter written by George
that was relayed via the Red Cross.
   ``It said that Chris George was kidnapped by five people, and
that they have certain demands,'' Abu Shaaban said in an interview.
   Abu Shaaban said George and Tony Charter, the director of Save
the Children in Gaza, were alone in the Gaza City office on Omar
el-Mukhtar street around noon Thursday when a Palestinian whom
George knew entered.
   ``The man said he wanted Chris to walk out of the office so that
they can discuss an important subject,'' Abu Shaaban said. ``Chris
never came back.''
   The Israeli news agency Itim reported George knew the man well
enough to hug and kiss him.
   A Palestinian journalist who spoke on condition of anonymity said
a Red Cross worker showed him one of two letters written in English
by George.
   ``After 20 hours I write my second letter to the American
ambassador and George Bush and his administration, the friends of
the Israeli government, in order to obtain my freedom,'' he quoted
the letter as saying.
   The letter, received by Save the Children today, said George was
abducted by five men armed with a machine gun and four grenades.
   It said the captors demanded the release of seven senior
Palestinian activists held in Israeli jails, including Sheikh Ahmed
Yassin, the wheelchair-bound spiritual leader of the Hamas
fundamentalist movement, which does not belong to the PLO; Mutawakil
Taha, a member of Yasser Arafat's Fatah organization and the head of
the Arab Writers Union, who is held without trial unde
administrative detention; and members of two PLO factions, the
Syrian-based Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and
pro-communist Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
   In addition, the letter said Israel should stop deporting
Palestinian activists and investigate the death of Omar Al Qassem, a
senior figure of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of
Palestine.
   Arab activists and Israeli officials said Qassem died of cancer
this month.
   Save the Children is a private international development and
relief organization with more than 3,000 employees in 40 countries.
   George lives with his wife and their two daughters outside the
West Bank town of Ramallah.
   George worked in Oman with the Peace Corps and in a Palestinian
refugee camp in Lebanon with Save the Children before moving to
Israel. He left Lebanon after kidnappings by Moslem radicals there
made it dangerous for Westerners.

<HEAD>Big-Ticket Orders Down in May</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Orders for big-ticket factory goods in May
plunged at the steepest rate in 10 months, the government said
Friday, raising the prospect of layoffs at manufacturing plants.
   In a second report indicating the economy is running out of
steam, the Commerce Department said Americans' income grew at the
slowest pace since September.
   Orders for durable goods _ items ranging from toasters to tanks _
fell 4.2 percent last month, to a seasonally adjusted $124.0
billion, the department reported. That was the largest decline since
July 1988 .
   Economists monitor the orders as a measure of the industrial
sector's health and to gauge the impact of interest rates on the
economy. Persistent weakness is liable to lead to layoffs at
manufacturing plants.
   ``It means fewer people will be needed to make things, whether
it's planes or cars or washing machines,'' said economist Cynthia
Latta of Data Resources Inc. in Lexington, Mass.
   In the other report, the government said American's personal
income and personal spending both rose a lackluster 0.3 percent last
month, not even keeping up with inflation.
   It was the weakest income number since September and worst
spending figure since October.
   Durable-goods orders have fallen in three of the last five months
and their level remains $5.9 billion below the December high of
$132.1 billion.
   At the same time that business is dropping off, manufacturers are
being squeezed by higher energy and labor costs, said economist
Allen Sinai of The Boston Co.
   ``Are we going to have layoffs? Yes. A big round of layoffs? I
would doubt it, not soon anyway, but by 1990, I wouldn't be
suprised,'' he said.
   The unemployment rate, in part reflecting weakness in
manufacturing, has risen to 5.2 percent last month, up from a
15-year low of 5 percent in March.
   However, William C. Dunkelberg, dean of Temple University's
business school, pointed out that the backlog of unfilled orders
remains high, at $467.6 billion, up 0.1 percent from April. That
will keep factory workers busy enough to cushion the effect of
lagging orders.
   ``I don't think it's anything too scary at this point,'' he said.
``If orders were to continue to deteriorate at this pace, obviously
we'd eat up that backlog pretty fast, but I don't think they will.''
   Friday's economic reports are consistent with other recent
evidence that the economy is slowing in response to a year-long
campaign by the Federal Reserve Board to fight inflation with higher
interest rates.
   Durable goods are particularly sensitive to interest rates
because consumers must usually borrow to buy them. Recently, the Fed
has eased monetary policy slightly in response to signs of
sluggishness.
   Michael K. Evans, a private economic consultant in Washington,
said the central bank likely will be cautious about loosening
further. But, he said, ``if we get another month of numbers like
these, the Fed is going to ease.''
   Analysts were less alarmed by the May report than they might have
been because orders had surged 3.2 percent in April and because May
was heavily influenced by a sharp decline in orders for aircraft and
parts.
   Excluding the volatile transportation sector, which swings widely
from month to month, orders fell a more moderate 2.1 percent in May
after rising 4.5 percent in April. Excluding military purchasing,
which is also volatile, orders declined 3.9 percent in May after a
5.1 percent rise a month earlier.
   Nevertheless, orders were down across all sectors last month.
   Transportation fell 9.4 percent; primary metals, including steel,
dropped 1.5 percent; electrical machinery was down 4.5 percent and
non-electrical machinery fell 3.4 percent. Orders for military goods
dropped 8.6 percent in May after a 18.2 percent plunge in April.
   Orders for non-defense capital goods, considered a good barometer
of business plans to expand and modernize, fell 8.3 percent in May
after rising 5.8 percent a month earlier. It was the biggest decline
since September.
   Shipments of durable goods also fell last month, edging down 0.1
percent to $123.3 billion. Shipments had risen 2.4 percent in April.

   They're burning Donald Duck, Mickey
Mouse and Bambi in Bangkok _ and Walt Disney executives couldn't be
happier.
   Torching toys, T-shirts and books emblazoned with the famous
cartoon characters is part of an offensive by Disney against rife
counterfeiting of its products across Asia.
   The American entertainment giant is enjoying a boom on the
continent, but also loses between $10 million and $20 million each
year in royalties because of the pirates, according to John J.
Feenie, who heads Disney's consumer products division in Asia. This
estimate does not include losses to pirates of Disney videotapes.
   Short of erecting their own Disneyland, adroit craftsmen fake
virtually all the company's merchandise: fluffy Mickey Mouse dolls,
videotapes of cartoon classics, children's clothing, books, pens,
stationery, figurines and watches.
   While many foreign companies are reluctant to become involved in
the legal wrangles and costs of tackling Asia's teeming pirates,
Feenie said Disney decided to take action after its fortunes surged
in Asia about two years ago and local licensees began to complain
about rip-offs.
   Thailand was picked as the first target. The country affords
copyright protection by law but has become a haven for pirates
because of lax enforcement, low penalties, cheap labor costs and a
vigorous entrepreneurial spirit. Copies of the world's leading brand
name products can be found on Bangkok's streets.
   Feenie said Thailand was also singled out because it is a big
exporter of Disney fakes to the Middle East and, perhaps most
importantly, is seen as major future market for and a legitimate
manufacturer of the company's consumer line.
   Disney already has licensed six companies in the country,
including Srithai Superware Co. Ltd., which Feenie described as ``a
model for us'' because it is following the rules and still making
hefty profits. Srithai produces children's dinnerware sets and
utensils for Disneyland and DisneyWorld in the United States,
Tokyo's Disneyland and other foreign outlets.
   ``We're not just going to be the big foreigner clubbing the
little guy,'' Feenie said in an interview. ``We want to help develop
local business. And it will be the locals who will fight for us
because they will see their own interests hurt by the pirates.''
   Following complaints from the Thai licensees, Disney hired an
outfit in the anti-counterfeiting field to run a three-month survey
of the market.
   A ``pile of cases'' accumulated, he said, and with police
cooperation, raids were staged beginning in March against the most
flagrant violators. Typically, these were sweatshop-type operators
with their own retail outlets.
   Confiscated merchandise worth about $30,000 has been burned in
big piles at a city dump. Disney executives hope the bonfires will
deter the fakers.
   ``We'll continue with the program. There will be no let-up until
there is a significant drop in the level of counterfeiting,'' Feenie
said. ``We're hoping other companies will join us. More hands make
lighter work.''
   The Disney vice president said similar campaigns to protect
copyrights and trademarks will be launched in Taiwan, South Korea
and Malaysia, while a ``second phase'' will focus on the Philippines
and Indonesia. China, despite its ``avalanche of counterfeits,'' is
not a current priority because of recent political turmoil.
   The massive fakery reflects Disney's mass appeal among Asians _
``Everyone loves Disney characters,'' says Feenie. The retail value
of Disney's consumer products, excluding videotapes, in Asia is
estimated at more than $1 billion and further growth is projected.
   Legitimate Disney business in Taiwan has doubled in the last two
years. ``The Mickey and Donald Show,'' a potpourri of old cartoons
dubbed in Mandarin, is seen by 250 million Chinese each week, making
it the No. 1 TV show in the world in terms of viewership, Feenie
said.
   In Japan, which is virtually counterfeit-free, Disney is notching
double-digit growth and considering another theme park along the
lines of Tokyo's Disneyland which opened in 1983 and has been a
money spinner since.
   The company, Feenie said, is even thinking about markets such as
Vietnam and the Indian subcontinent, where Mickey Mouse and his crew
_ enduringly lovable and profitable _ have yet to make an inroad.

   Jewish Holocaust survivors who adjusted best to
life after World War II were able to seal away their traumas so
successfully that they protect even their present-day dreams,
according to an Israeli study.
   The findings suggest that modern techniques of treating
post-traumatic stress syndrome, such as that suffered by Vietnam war
veterans, may actually be aggravating the disorder instead of curing
it, said Peretz Lavie, a psychology professor at Technion-Israel
Institute of Technology in Haifa where the study was conducted.
   In a paper prepared for presentation today at the annual meeting
of the Association of Professional Sleep Societies, Lavie said a
study of a group of survivors of the Holocaust found those who were
the most healthy mentally had learned to suppress recall of
virtually all dreams.
   This, he said, was a defense mechanism against the awful memories
of the Nazi persecution of Jews during World War II.
   These survivors also spent little time while awake thinking about
the wartime trauma and showed little interest in reviewing their
experiences. Yet, when prompted, they could recall those days in
detail.
   ``These data suggest it is better to suppress some types of
trauma,'' Lavie said in an interview Thursday. ``It's better to
forget it than to year after year expose them to the trauma through
therapy.''
   One Washington psychiatrist, defending the current conventional
treatment, suggested that Lavie needed to prove his theory by
testing the alternative theories with matched sets of Holocaust
survivors.
   In the study, Lavie and an associate, Hanna Kaminer, used 23
Holocaust survivors to investigate the long-term effects of mental
trauma by recording the dreams recalled when awakened in the midst
of deep sleep.
   The group included 11 survivors who were determined by tests to
have adjusted very well to life after the war. The other 12
continued to suffer the effects of the Holocaust with emotional and
mental problems and general dissatisfaction with life.
   For four consecutive nights, each of the subjects slept in a
laboratory while their body processes, such as heart beat,
respiration and brain activity, were monitored.
   When slumber reached a point called rapid eye movement, or REM,
sleep, they were awakened and asked to recount their dreams.
   Previous studies have shown that most people awakened during REM
sleep can recall dreams about 80 percent of the time.
   ``The well-adjusted had only 30 percent dream recall,'' said
Lavie. ``When we woke them up they denied dreaming. They were
disappointed that they couldn't remember any dreams because they
truly wanted to help our study.''
   This group, he said, also ``had no sleep disturbances
whatsoever,'' enjoying peaceful and untroubled sleep before and
after the awakenings.
   The poorly adjusted Holocaust survivors, however, had a 60
percent dream recall, and ``showed all the signs of post-traumatic
stress disorders'' in their sleeping pattern, said Lavie.
   ``There were multiple arousals, they suffered from difficulty in
falling asleep and there were body movements,'' he said. ``But they
remembered twice the dreams than the well-adjusted did.''
   Lavie said the few dreams recalled by the well-adjusted were
short, simple and devoid of emotions.
   ``The dreams of the poorly-adjusted included anxiety, regression
_ inwardly directed. It was mostly all anxiety,'' he said.
   Based on further tests, Lavie said it became evident the
well-adjusted survivors had coped with their Holocaust experience by
avoiding the memory.
   ``They sealed it off and this enabled them to go on with their
life,'' said Lavie. ``This was the mechanism that allowed them to
survive and adapt and adjust.''
   The mechanism even included what the study called ``massive dream
repression'' that protected against any unconscious recall of the
distressing memories.
   Lavie said the study suggests that similar ``sealing off'' should
be taught to Vietnam and other war veterans who continue to suffer
emotional traumas from their experiences.
   Currently, he said, the practice is to treat such stress
disorders by forcing the patients to recall the trauma and to relive
the emotions. The idea is rather like lancing and draining a wound.
   But Lavie said it may be better to seal the wound with mental
scar tissue and, instead, to teach the PTSD patient to forget.
   ``We say that in some cases, repression is the key to cure,''
said Lavie. ``We should stop all of the nonsense of going back over
and over the trauma, and just treat them in the here-and-now and
divert their attention from the experience.''
   Lavie said his group is now conducting research, using the
suppression technique, on veterans of the Israeli wars and hopes to
confirm this new method of treating PTSD.
   Dr. Stephen M. Sonnenberg, a Washington psychiatrist and author
of the book ``The Trauma of War: Stress and Recovery in Viet Nam
Veterans,'' said he has not seen details of the sleep study, nor
talked with Lavie.
   But, he said, the theory of treating poorly adapted trauma
survivors by causing them to forget experiences ``runs counter to
current conventional wisdom among those who provide psychotherapy
for survivors.''
   ``Most of us feel that the essence of treatment is in assisting
the survivor in thinking about the traumatic experience and
mastering it,'' said Sonnenberg in a telephone interview.
   He said that to test the Lavie's theory there should be matched
groups of survivors treated in different ways, with one group
encouraged to remember their traumatic experiences and the other
encouraged to forget.
   ``Only then would Dr. Lavie's hypothesis be reasonably tested,''
said Sonnenberg.

<TEXT>
   A new biography of Mike Tyson quotes the
heavyweight champion as saying he enjoys hurting women and the best
punch he ever landed was on ex-wife Robin Givens.
   The book, ``Fire and Fear: The Inside Story of Mike Tyson,'' was
written by former Tyson friend Jose Torres, himself a former boxing
champion. Excerpts of the book were published in today's editions of
the New York Daily News, and further portions were scheduled to be
published in the August Playboy.
   In one, Tyson was quoted and saying that he once fought with
Givens and ``she really offended me and I went BAM. She flew
backwards, hitting every ... wall in the apartment. That was the
best punch I've ever thrown in my entire life.''
   Tyson also details a sadistic viewpoint on sex: ``I like to hurt
women when I make love to them. I like to hear them scream with
pain, to see them bleed.''
   The office of Tyson adviser Don King, who is also portrayed
unflatteringly in the book, said the two were both considering
filing suit.
   Tyson and Givens married in February 1988 and divorced less than
a year later. The actress, who appears in the television series
``Head of the Class,'' had accused her husband of physical violence
during their marriage.
   Talking about his first round knockout of Jesse Ferguson, Tyson
said, ``I was trying to push his nose bone up into his brains.''
   The book also provides unflattering portraits of a greedy Givens
and an anti-Semitic King.
   Torres writes of Givens screaming at one of Tyson's
representatives at the investment firm of Merrill Lynch: ``I want my
money! Where is my money? You're one of Cayton's boys. We're going
to take our money out of here.''
   Tyson's managers were Jim Jacobs and Billy Cayton. Jacobs has
died, and Cayton and Tyson are embroiled in a bitter court fight
over the champion's finances.
   King, the fight promoter who has recently become Tyson's adviser,
told the Daily News both he and the heavyweight champion were
considering lawsuits against Torres, and he called the book
ununauthorized and a smear. King's office said today that he and
Tyson would be releasing a statement later in the day with more
detail.

   Some people seem unable to distinguish a cathedral
from a pub, according to a lawmaker who complained Friday about
cigarette smoking in churches.
   Harry Greenway, a member of the Conservative Party, said he had
reported a tourist for smoking in Westminster Abbey last week. An
abbey warden who had warned the offender received ``a packet of
cheek'' in return, Greenway said.
   ``More and more people are casual. They come into churches and
cathedrals, not having a religious background of any kind and not
even a real respect for God's house,'' Greenway said.
   ``They don't even know what they are doing. They don't know that
it is offensive.''
   Speaking in a House of Commons debate on the problem of litter,
Greenaway proposed that people who smoke or throw trash in a church
should be fined at least $1,550.

<HEAD>Liquor, Appliance Prices Raised</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The cost of Polish-made liquor went up an
average 50 percent Friday in the latest of a series of steep price
increases imposed as part of an economic reform program.
   A half liter of vodka now costs nearly 4 percent of an average
monthly salary.
   The increase, announced overnight to prevent hoarding, also is
designed to combat alcoholism under a law requiring liquor prices to
rise faster than incomes, the state-run PAP news agency said.
   The price of a half liter of the most popular vodka will rise
from about $2.99 to about $4.78.
   The average salary for May was about $124 per month, with the
average old age, disability or veterans' pension put at about $52
monthly.
   Most varieties of liquor, including those that are imported, must
be purchased for hard currency at special stores.
   Earlier this week, prices for sugar, refrigerators and washing
machines were raised as the government works to get prices closer to
the state-subsidized cost of production without setting off the
social unrest and strikes that have often followed increases.
   The price rises come at a sensitive time, following the freest
elections in Poland's communist history during which candidates from
the Solidarity-led opposition won a big share of the National
Assembly.
   Legal again after a seven-year ban and now a partner with the
government in Poland's political and economic life, Solidarity may
risk being assigned a degree of responsibility for the increases.
   The union and government have agreed that salaries will be raised
automatically to cover 80 percent of average price increases, but
there is a lag of several months between the time new prices take
effect and workers receive the raises.
   The cost of the standard model refrigerator was raised from about
$84 to $142, PAP said. The prices of washing machines were raised 37
percent.
   Despite the high cost, neither appliance is readily available in
stores.
   The price of sugar was raised from 25 cents to 41 cents for 2.2
pounds, with the government reporting that demand was exceeding
supply.
   The annual inflation rate in Poland is officially projected at
about 60 percent annually but already this year is running at a rate
of more than 100 percent.

   Iran-Contra prosecutors moved Friday to dismiss
some charges and narrow the scope of others against former national
security adviser John M. Poindexter to eliminate obstacles posed by
using government secrets in a trial.
   In a motion filed a week after he announced plans to abandon the
charges, independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh asked for dismissial
of wire fraud and theft of government property charges stemming from
the diversion of U.S.-Iran arms sales to finance the Nicaraguan
rebels.
   Walsh also asked U.S. District Judge Harold Greene to narrow the
scope of conspiracy charge against Poindexter to eliminate all
references to the arms-sale diversion and clandestine efforts to
help the Contras.
   Poindexter would still be charged with conspiring to obstruct
congressional inquiries into the Iran-Contra affair, two counts of
obstruction and two counts of making false statements to
congressional investigators in 1986.
   ``Experience in the recently-completed trial of Oliver North has
made clear that certain broad-reaching allegations... concerning
defendant's interaction with intelligence agencies and
highly-classified covert programs _ create the potential for
difficult problems in dealing with classified information,'' the
motion said.
   Prosecutors dropped the major Iran-Contra conspiracy charges
against North because intelligence agencies refused to allow public
disclosure of government secrets the trial judge had ruled were
needed by the defense.
   Walsh said his decision to seek dismissal of the charges against
Poindexter was based discussions with intelligence agencies about
the former national security adviser's request for secret documents.
   ``Although it might be possible to resolve those problems through
limitations on the scope of discovery and proceedings udner CIPA
(Classified Information Procedures Act), independent counsel
believes that the cost of such efforts, in terms of both delay and
consumption of resources of the court and the parties, would be
excessive,'' Walsh said.
   No date has been set for Poindexter's trial.
   North, a former National Security Council aide, is awaiting
sentencing on three felony convictions arising from his involvement
in the Iran-Contra affair.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Friday by the Supreme Court.
   
   PHONE PORN
   
   The court refused to let Congress totally outlaw the
billion-dollar ``dial-a-porn'' industry, rejecting arguments that
such a ban is needed to protect the nation's children from merely
``indecent'' messages.
   The justices unanimously said Congress was not justified when it
passed a law last year banning all sexually explicit telephone
dial-up message services.
   Congress may outlaw obscene telephone messages only, not indecent
ones, the court said. The dial-a-porn industry therefore must be
allowed to survive, it said.
   The cases are Sable Communications v. FCC, 88-515, and FCC vs.
Sable Communications, 88-525.
   
   DEATH ROW
   
   The court ruled that states are not required by the Constitution
to provide free lawyers for death row inmates who lost an initial
round of appeals.
   By a 5-4 vote, the court ruled in favor of Virginia officials who
said requiring states to pay for attorneys in second-round appeals
could lead to interminable delays in carrying out executions.
   The case is Murray vs. Giarrantano, 88-411.
   
   AGE BIAS
   
   The court made it more difficult for older workers to prove that
when some of their benefits are reduced their employers violated a
federal law against age discrimination.
   By a 7-2 vote, the court revived an Ohio pension law provision
challenged by a woman forced to retire because of a disability.
   The case is Public Employees Retirement System of Ohio vs. Betts,
88-389.
   
   TAX OPINIONS
   
   The court ruled that the Justice Department has a legal
obligation to supply a weekly tax magazine with copies of all
federal trial court opinions and orders in tax cases.
   The justices, by an 8-1 vote, said the federal Freedom of
Information Act imposes such a duty on the Justice Department's tax
division.
   The case is U.S. Justice Department vs. Tax Analysts, 88-782.
   
   BANKRUPTCY
   
   The court ruled that states are immune from being sued for
monetary damages by bankrupt businesses and individuals.
   By a 5-4 vote in a Connecticut case, the court said federal
bankruptcy law may not be used to pierce the legal armor the
Constitution gives states.
   The cases are Hoffman vs. Connecticut Department of Income
Maintenance, 88-412, and Granfinanciers vs. Nordberg, 87-1716.

   A jammed airfoil caused the jetliner crash that
killed 18 people after an aborted takeoff in East Berlin, East
Germany's news agency said Friday.
   The Soviet-built Ilyushin-62 of East Germany's Interflug airline,
with 113 people on board, crashed through trees and burst into
flames at East Berlin's Schoenefeld airport June 17.
   The nose of the Moscow-bound jetliner lifted during takeoff but
then slammed back onto the runway, witnesses said. The jet careened
through a field, ripping apart as it hurtled along, and burst into
flames after coming to a stop.
   One of those killed was a farmer hit by debris as he was working
in the field.
   A commission found that a blocked elevator caused the accident,
the official ADN news agency said. An airplane's elevator, an
airfoil hinged to the tail section, is used to make a plane go up
and down.
   The reasons for the malfunction were still under investigation by
the commission, headed by Transport Minister Otto Arndt, ADN said.
   No evidence of negligence by the crew or ground personnel had
been found, the news agency said.
   The death toll in the accident rose to 18, apparently after a
victim died of injuries suffered in the crash.

<TEXT>
   The leaders of Hungary's Communist Party
met privately Friday to try to resolve a power struggle over the
pace of political reform and decide whether to replace their party
chief.
   Emil Kimmel, a spokesman for the Central Committee, told
Hungarian radio the meeting of the policy-setting body would
continue Saturday because so many people had asked to speak in the
debate.
   Another issue before the committee was the agenda for a party
congress meeting this fall. The congress is to approve radical
changes in party policies to boost the communists' chances in
multiparty elections to be held by next summer.
   Party members who back sweeping reforms have called for the
committee to replace party chief Karoly Grosz with a leading
reformer. The most popular reformers include Politburo member Rezsoe
Nyers, Minister of State Imre Pozsgay and Foreign Minister Gyula
Horn.
   Grosz, considered a centrist, took over as party general
secretary from Janos Kadar in May 1988. But he has lost support as
the conflicts between reformers and more orthodox communists have
intesified.
   Reformers have increasingly argued that only a popular figure
such as Pozsgay or Nyers could guarantee the communists a victory in
multiparty elections.
   The party and opposition groups arov. 11,
1975.
   Agostinho Neto, the movement's leader, immediately requested
Cuba's help to fight off Jonas Savimbi's South African-backed
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, and the
National Liberation Front of Angola.
   The latter eventually disbanded, while fighters of the
charismatic Savimbi retreated and established bush headquarters in
the thinly populated southeastern corner of Angola.
   From there, they staged hit-and-run guerrilla raids throughout
the huge country and fought semi-conventional battles against Cuban
and government troops attacking their southeastern strongholds.
   Savimbi's army has controlled most of southeastern Angola for
years, administering schools and hospitals in rural areas occupied
by 2 million to 3 million of the country's 9 million inhabitants.
   The United States has supplied them with Stinger ground-to-air
missiles and other sophisticated weapons, while South African troops
have invaded Angola to help the rebels.
   In one of its largest incursions, South Africa sent 15,000 troops
more than 60 miles into Angola in 1981.
   Thousands of South African soldiers, based in Namibia, fought in
southern Angola in 1985 and returned in 1988 to take part in a major
battle for southeastern Cuito Cuanavale.
   In May 1988, both the Cuban-Angolan forces and the rebels and
South Africans claimed they had won control of the city in the
heaviest fighting of the war.
   Both sides seemed ready for even larger battles. Cuban troop
strength had surpassed 50,000 and South Africa acknowledged it had
3,000 soldiers more or less based in Angola.
   Faced with an open-ended conflict and mounting white casualties,
South Africa opted for peace talks which began with Angola and Cuba
in May 1988.
   South Africa completed withdrawing from Angola last August. In
December, the three countries signed an accord calling for South
Africa to halt aid to Savimbi and grant independence to Namibia,
while Cuba withdraws its troops.
   The rebels, meanwhile, vowed to fight on for a share in
government. There have been regular reports of battles this year,
and last month the rebels accused government forces of using
chemical warfare.
   As recently as Monday, Angolan Foreign Minister Afonso van Dunem
said his government would not negotiate with the rebels.
   Savimbi on Wednesday gave reporters no indication that he would
meet Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos on Thursday in Zaire,
where the cease-fire was announced.

<HEAD>Stanford Agrees To Return Ohlone Skeletal Remains To Indians</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STANFORD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stanford University has agreed to return
ancestral bones to Ohlone-Costanoans Indians, but an archaeologist
said Thursday no one has claimed the bones yet and scholars may ask
for time for more research.
   Indians have praised the move to return for reburial the skeletal
remains they consider sacred, but some anthropologists say it is a
blow to medical research.
   The announcement Wednesday followed five years of negotiations
between Stanford and the Ohlone tribe.
   Stanford archaeologist Barbara Bocek explained Thursday that
Stanford is ``giving the Indians the right to decide'' whether to
take possession of the more than 500 bones or allow delays for
further investigation.
   Once the Indians take charge of the remains, Bocek said, it would
be assumed that they would be reburied and gone forever from
research.
   The decision is up to the Ohlones, and ``if they came today for
the bones'' they would be returned, Bocek said.
   But ``they don't have a hole big enough for the bones. They don't
have a place to put them and they haven't asked for them,'' she said.
   Stanford's decision, which could convince other universities to
do the same, was characterized as an extremely difficult one for the
academics to make. Praise from the Indians was immediate.
   Rayna Green, a Cherokee scholar and author from Washington, D.C.,
said she knew of no other formal agreement like the one between
Stanford and the Ohlones.
   ``It's really extraordinary,'' she said. ``I'm deeply admiring of
what Stanford is doing.''
   ``The decision to support reinterment has been difficult,''
Provost James Rosse wrote to the elders of Ohlones who, like other
native peoples, regard ancestral remains as sacred.
   In Washington, the chairman of the anthropology department of the
Smithsonian Institution said researchers have made important strides
recently in analyzing proteins in Indian remains that could help
medical researchers in the study of bone and joint diseases.
   ``From a scientific standpoint, it's a very bad move,'' Donald
Ortner told The Washington Post. ``There is going to be a terrible
price to be paid down the road.''
   Bocek said most of the remains involved come from California's
Ryan Mound in Fremont, and the Castro Mound in Mountain View. Most
of the remains were acquired by Stanford scholars as far back as the
turn of the century.
   ``Indians feel an extremely great sense of continuity with their
ancestors over generations,'' she said. ``The tradition of respect
and responsibility for their elders, including those who died long
ago, is still a very vital part of the culture.''
   Rosemary Cambra, a representative of the Ohlones, said she was
``very, very happy Stanford has agreed to respect the religious
rights of the Indians.''
   Larry Myers, executive secretary of the Native American Heritage
Commission in Sacramento, said the decision was crucial.
   ``This decision actually puts Stanford several steps ahead of
where the nation appears to be going,'' he said, advising that there
should be limits placed by the university on the research time for
analysis of remains.

<HEAD>Woman Injured In Bathroom By Rodeo Bull Awarded More Than $15,000</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A rodeo group must compensate a woman injured
when an enraged bull jumped three fences and charged into the
bathroom where she was waiting out the competition, a judge ruled.
   The indoor rodeo arena's 5{-foot restraining fences should have
been higher to contain the bull, even though he ``performed a
routine that even an Olympic steeplechase horse'' would have trouble
duplicating, said District Judge Jon Kerian.
   The bull, after throwing its rider and chasing a rodeo clown out
of the ring, went over the fences and down a hall before bursting
into the bathroom, according to testimony.
   The animal pinned Barbara Deck against a wall, injuring her left
shoulder and arm, and kicked out a bathroom sink before the woman
was rescued by cowboys, said her attorney, David Hogue.
   Mrs. Deck was waiting while her husband watched the bull riding
because she once saw a bull break the legs of its rider, Hogue said.
   The North Dakota Rodeo Association must pay Mrs. Deck $15,000
plus more than $3,000 in medical expenses for the July 1985
incident, Kerian ruled Wednesday after a one-day trial. Kerian also
awarded Daniel Deck $3,000 for the loss of his wife's services in
farm chores.
   The Rodeo Association's attorney, Lawrence Dopson, said an appeal
was unlikely.

<HEAD>Chicago Theater Company Well-Received In London</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<UNK>Associated Press Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chicago's Steppenwolf Theater Company received
mostly warm reviews from London critics Friday following the
European debut of its stage version of John Steinbeck's ``The Grapes
of Wrath.''
   Jack Tinker in The Daily Mail called the play, adapted from
Steinbeck's Depression-era, Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, ``as
shatteringly a perfect piece of American theater as you are likely
to experience in a lifetime of trans-Atlantic travel.''
   Claire Armitstead in The Financial Times found the show ``a
magnificent ensemble piece ... richly and simply evocative.''
   London is the third stop for the play, which bowed in Chicago
last September, before moving last month to the La Jolla Playhouse
in California. The hope is for it to go to Broadway in the upcoming
season if financing can be found for a New York production with a
cast of 35.
   The 12-performance London engagement at the National's midsized
Lyttelton Auditorium was 70 percent sold before it opened. It is
expected to sell out the remainder of the run, through July 1, on
the strength of the reviews.
   It is the second Steppenwolf show to be seen in London, following
the 1986 run of Lyle Kessler's ``Orphans,'' with British actor
Albert Finney.
   The three-hour play is more faithful to the book than was John
Ford's 1940 movie starring Henry Fonda and Jane Darwell as Tom and
Ma Joad, who lead a community of itinerants westward across the dust
bowl to California.
   Adapted and directed by Frank Galati, an Oscar nominee this year
for co-writing ``The Accidental Tourist,'' the play stars Gary
Sinise as Tom and Lois Smith as his mother.
   Jeremy Kingston in The Times of London praised Sinise as
``intense and sinewy.'' While he pointed to ``a faltering in the
second half,'' he said ``for the most part Galati's dramatization is
convincingly theatrical.''
   Milton Shulman in The Standard said: ``The cast, in spite of
characters that are often too sentimental and too one-dimensional
for credibility, provide ensemble acting of almost balletic
precision.''
   Maureen Paton in The Daily Express sounded a notable note of
dissent, writing: ``The cast are about as moving as Mount Rushmore.''
   ``It is no wonder Dustin Hoffman was desperate to join a British
theater company if this is typical of what the American stage has to
offer,'' she said, referring to the Oscar-winning actor's local
appearance, amid a British cast, in Shakespeare's ``The Merchant of
Venice.''
   The actors coped well with complex technical demands and the
occasional hitch, which included a fire alarm that rang for five
minutes during the performance.
   Americans arrived in force to cheer on Steppenwolf at the
opening, filling about 160 of the Lyttelton's 900 seats.
   ``The Grapes of Wrath'' is the second production in the
National's International '89 series, which continues in September
with the Moscow Art Theater performing Anton Chekhov's ``Uncle
Vanya.''

   A confessed double murderer who said he
thought he was doing a service to society when he killed homosexual
men was executed by injection early Friday.
   As five guards strapped Sean Patrick Flanagan, 28, to a gurney in
the death chamber at the Nevada State Prison, the condemned man
smiled and told prosecutor Dan Seaton, ``I love you.''
   ``He has said it before,'' Seaton said. ``He means it in terms of
Christian love and forgiveness.''
   ``I think he believes he is a Christian, but from God's
perception, no,'' the deputy Clark County district attorney added.
``I'm sure he'd kill again.''
   Flanagan, who spent his last hours reading the Bible, was
declared dead eight minutes after the lethal injection began at 2:01
a.m.
   It was the second execution in five days in Nevada, and the
state's fourth and the nation's 114th since the 1976 U.S. Supreme
Court ruling allowing states to resume use of the death penalty.
   Flanagan was executed for two 1987 killings in Las Vegas after
Gov. Bob Miller rejected a last-minute petition for a stay from the
American Civil Liberties Union.
   Miller said he wouldn't intervene and that Flanagan had appeals
available if he wanted to stop the execution.
   Flanagan told The Associated Press in an interview Wednesday that
he would not pursue appeals because he had to pay his debt to
society. But he maintained, ``After giving my life to Jesus, I
couldn't hurt anybody again.''
   Flanagan apologized to the families of his victims and said, ``I
hope they'll understand my execution is proper and just.''
   In a seven-page statement, he revealed that he hated his
homosexuality. He said it was difficult for him to determine what
made him kill men he thought were homosexual, but ``the thought that
I would be doing some good for our society crossed my mind.''
   Flanagan confessed to two murders after he was arrested in
Orange, Calif., for jaywalking. He said he strangled and dismembered
45-year-old chef James Lewandowski, who had befriended him after he
lost all his money drinking and gambling. Four days later, he said,
he strangled pianist Albert Duggins, 59, after Duggins offered him a
ride.

   Four men burst into a funeral home and
opened fire with submachine guns, killing six people and injuring
two, police said Friday.
   The attack, apparently drug-related, occurred Thursday night in a
room of the Campos de Paz funeral home containing the body of
Herbert Obando Posada, who had been slain Wednesday.
   The dead included the father and a brother of Obando Posada,
police said.
   The gunmen escaped in a car.
   Police said they suspect the slayings were the result of a war
between the Medellin and Cali drug cartels, which has intensified in
recent weeks and has left 180 people dead in the last 17 months.
   The cartels are fighting for control of the New York cocaine
market, estimated to be worth about $35 million a year.

<TEXT>
   Attorneys for actor Rob Lowe will go before a
federal judge Monday in their attempt to kill a lawsuit stemming
from a sexual videotape he made of a teen-age girl during a visit to
Atlanta.
   Lena Arlene Wilson sued Lowe, contending he enticed her daughter,
Jan Parsons, then 16, into a videotaped encounter with another
woman. The incident occurred last summer, when Lowe was in town for
the Democratic National Convention. The lawsuit seeks unspecified
damages.
   U.S. District Judge G. Ernest Tidwell scheduled a hearing Monday
on a motion by Lowe's attorneys to dismiss the lawsuit. They also
are seeking to recover court costs from Ms. Wilson and her attorney.
   According to published reports and court documents, Miss Parsons
and a friend met Lowe, star of films including ``The Hotel New
Hampshire'' and ``St. Elmo's Fire,'' at downtown Atlanta's Rio
nightclub during the Democratic convention last July. They returned
to his hotel suite, where they had sex with him and each other as
Lowe taped the proceedings.
   Excerpts from the videotape have been shown repeatedly on
television news in Atlanta.
   A motion by Lowe's attorneys denies he ``has committed any
wrongful acts giving rise to liability.'' But a motion from Ms.
Wilson's attorney says witnesses have confirmed Lowe had sex with
Miss Parsons, and contends that Lowe has admitted it to his
California lawyers.
   Lowe's attorneys have contended that Ms. Wilson and her former
husband attempted to blackmail the actor before filing their
lawsuit, but Ms. Wilson's attorney denies any such attempt.

<TEXT>
   A special White House file that was never
searched contained documents in the Iran-Contra affair touching on
the Reagan administration's aid arrangements with Honduras, leaders
of the Senate Intelligence Committee said today.
   Sens. David Boren, D-Okla., the committee chairman; and William
Cohen, R-Maine, the ranking minority member, said the ``head of
state'' file held three 1985 documents detailing an administration
plan to slip an extra $110 million in aid to Honduras if that
country would support the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
   President Reagan initialed his approval for the arrangement on
one of the documents, which were all originals.
   The three documents weren't turned over to the congressional
Iran-Contra committees. Copies of the documents found in the
National Security Council files of Oliver North were first disclosed
this year at North's trial stemming from the Iran-Contra affair.
   At a news conference, Boren and Cohen said the intelligence
committee found no evidence in an investigation to suggest that a
half-dozen documents, including those found in the head of state
files, had been systematically withheld by the White House.
   In a 51-page report, the committee concluded that ``any
systematic effort by the White House to prevent their production''
to Congress ``would have been difficult to accomplish.''
   It added that the committee ``cannot, however, absolutely rule
out the possibility that selective efforts could have been made ...
to remove certain copies of the documents.''
   The report attributed the failure to produce the documents to
Congress ``most likely ... to the mistaken, but good-faith
judgment'' of FBI agents conducting a search for them in connection
with the criminal investigation of the Iran-Contra scandal.
   The report also said the committee was ``unable to explain with
certainty'' why an Oct. 30, 1985 White House document dealing with
airdropping recoilless rifles to the Contras didn't come to the
attention of Congress.

   President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire will visit
Washington next week at President Bush's invitation, the White House
said Friday.
   Mobutu will meet with Bush on Thursday, including a ``working
luncheon'' in the presidential residence, said press secretary
Marlin Fitzwater.
   Fitzwater said the leaders would discuss Zaire's role in pressing
for peace in southern Africa and in Angola.
   This week's cease-fire ``was very much the product'' of efforts
by Mobutu and ``an important first step,'' Fitzwater said.
   The leader of U.S.-backed rebels in Angola and the Marxist
president of the nation have agreed to a cease-fire, effective at
midnight Saturday, in the civil war there, with an accord worked out
at a summit in Zaire.
   Details of the peace agreement were left to be worked out later
between rebel leader Jonas Savimbi and Angola's President Eduardo
dos Santos. Civil war has ravaged Angola since it gained
independence 14 years ago.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler termed the summit
a ``significant breakthrough'' in efforts to peacefully resolve
Angola's civil war, and said dos Santos and Savimbi are to be
congratulated for their political courage in taking the step toward
national reconciliation.
   She also singled out for praise Mobutu who put his prestige and
political weight behind the initiative.

   A homeless man who found shelter in a
giant trash bin was scooped up by a rubbish truck and tossed into
its compactor, where he was found dead.
   ``When the truck starts to pick it up, I figure that guy would
wake up and probably bounce up pretty quick and say, `Hey guys, I'm
here,''' said city sanitation manager Mark Gauerke.
   An autopsy Thursday failed to immediately determine the cause of
death, which means the man could have been dead before he was
hoisted into the truck, said Los Angeles County coroner's spokesman
Bob Dambacher.
   The identity of the 41-year-old man was being withheld while
authorities tried to find relatives.
   The man's body was covered with cuts and bruises but didn't
appear crushed, although he had been tossed into the compactor,
which can exert more than 17,000 pounds of pressure per square inch,
said Smith.

<HEAD>Confirmation Hearings End With Failed Endorsements for Some</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Committees of the new Soviet legislature have ended
confirmation hearings on nominees for Cabinet posts after failing to
endorse some appointees, news reports said Friday.
   ``Not all candidates proposed by Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov were
supported by the deputies,'' Tass reported without identifying the
rejected appointees.
   Committees of the Supreme Soviet began hearings Monday on 13
Ryzhkov aides and more than 50 ministers in an exercise of the new
oversight powers they gained under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
political reforms.
   The Communist Party daily newspaper Pravda reported Friday the
nominees who failed to win committee endorsements were Supreme Court
members and officials of the nation's prosecutor's office. The
newspaper did not identify the rejected candidates, saying they
still had a chance to be approved by the full Supreme Soviet that
convenes Monday.
   Deputy Nikolai I. Ignatovich, an investigator in the Byelorussian
prosecutor's office, told Pravda he opposed the Supreme Court
nominees because they were incumbents who had arbitrarily
interpreted the law and continue to distort it. He also told Pravda
the court system had not guaranteed fair trials, and he held the
nominees responsible.
   Pravda also gave a partial account of a Supreme Soviet
committee's grilling of Alexandra P. Biryukova, nominee to head the
government's Bureau of Social Development. She has been in that post
since last October, working on consumer issues and social policy.
   The newspaper said one deputy asked Biryukova whether it was true
the special department of the Health Ministry that provides medical
care for the Soviet elite had a budget of $692.3 million and served
only 480,000 people. The Health Ministry, the deputy charged, was
spending far less per capita on ordinary citizens.
   She said she didn't know the budget of the secretive Fourth
Midecal Department, but that the figure cited was too high.
Biryukova said the Health Ministry was placing priority on improving
childrens hospitals and maternity clinics.
   At a May 31 meeting of the parliament, the Congress of People's
Deputies, party maverick Boris N. Yeltsin called for the Fourth
Medical Department to be used for caring for mothers and their
children.
   ``This should be done for the sake of our future, to avoid having
a situation when infant mortality its twice that of any civilized
country,'' Yeltsin said.
   But Health Minister Yevgeny Chazov rejected the suggestion,
saying the Fourth Medical Department's facilities were not suitable
for care of mothers and children.
   The hearings were not televised, and foreign reporters were
barred from attending. The Soviet press has given them only sparse
coverage.
   Tass has said that among the candidates under scrutiny were
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, Defense Minister Dmitri T.
Yazov and KGB Chairman Vladimir Kryuchkov.
   The 542-member Supreme Soviet is scheduled to meet for 40 days to
confirm the appointees and begin drafting legislation.
   In proposing the Cabinet members June 10, Ryzhkov said the number
of ministries would be slashed to streamline the government.

   Fourteen members of the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders
say they are quitting the squad because new owner Jerry Jones wants
them to wear skimpier uniforms, fraternize with the players and
appear in beer commercials.
   Jones denied that he wanted to make such changes.
   ``When (quarterback) Roger Staubach went out, he went out on top.
They have retired. I'm resigning,'' cheerleader director Debbie
Bond, 36, said today.
   In addition to Ms. Bond, all 14 veteran cheerleaders have said
they will leave the team because of the dispute over the costumes,
The Dallas Morning News reported.
   The 23 rookie members have until Monday to decide if they will
stay with the squad, which has been training in summer camp since
May 6.
   In an early afternoon news conference at the Cowboys' Valley
Ranch headquarters, Jones said the rule remains in effect calling
for cheerleaders not to fraternize with players or employees.
   ``Those policies are intact. They are a very valuable and
time-tested procedure,'' Jones said.
   He said he likes the traditional uniform of the cheerleaders and
did not plan to change it. ``It seems as though a lot of that was
said in the meeting was speculation,'' he said.
   Ms. Bond, who has been with the organization for 10 years, said
earlier that she talked with Jones on Thursday after hearing that
the Arkansas oilman had told the players there would be
fraternization between the players and cheerleaders.
   ``He said, `You can either accept it or move on,''' Ms. Bond
said. ``Mr. Jones does not believe in rules.''
   Jones fired Tom Landry, the only head coach in the team's
history, on the same day he purchased the team. The Landry firing
angered Dallas fans, who turned out by the thousands later when the
city held a parade and ceremony in Landry's honor.
   Under former owner H.R. ``Bum'' Bright, the cheerleaders were not
allowed to drink or even be photographed with someone holding a
drink while they were wearing their uniforms.
   Twiggy Isip, 21, a two-year veteran of the squad, said Jones
``wanted to change the uniform, and do you know what he wanted?
Biker shorts and a halter top. He wants us to play hostess at
parties and fraternize with the team. We've never done that.''
   ``The worst thing is _ he wants us to be in beer commercials,''
she said. ``We've never even been able to to have a drink in our
hand.''
   The current cheerleader uniform is shorts, long-sleeved blue
shirts tied in the front to leave the midriff partially bare, a
fringed bolero-type vest, and white boots. Biker shorts are made of
an elastic material that molds to the body, while a halter top
leaves the arms and back mostly bare.
   The squad that has cheered on what was once America's Team set
the standards for NFL cheerleaders beginning with Super Bowl X in
1976 when a cheerleader winked into a camera and captured the
attention of the nation, Ms. Bond said.
   They had their first open auditions in the spring of 1976, and
cheerleaders now work for $15 a game _ $13.94 after taxes, said
Suzanne Mitchell, who founded the squad at former president and
general manager Tex Schramm's suggestion.
   Ms. Mitchell resigned after 15 years with the Cowboys when Jones
bought the team in February. She has joined Schramm at the Worldwide
League of American Football.
   ``I'm the one who established all those rules in the first
place,'' Ms. Mitchell said today. ``It separated the Cowboys
Cheerleaders from everybody else.'' Ms. Mitchell said the line
between the players and the cheerleaders was important to maintain
respect for the performers.
   Ms. Mitchell said the squad did more than dance routines and
shake pompons, including making 18 Department of Defense tours,
visiting nursing homes and children's hospitals, and performing on
telethons to raise millions of dollars for charity.

   The Senate Finance Committee approved
legislation Friday that could lead to U.S. trade preferences for
Poland.
   The committee without dissent voted to strike Poland from the
list of countries whose exports are not eligible for tariff-free
entry into the United States. That list includes communist
governments, developed countries and others, such as South Africa,
that are penalized for foreign-policy reasons.
   Enactment of the House-passed bill would let President Bush
determine whether some Polish exports should be eligible for
duty-free treatment. The administration asked expedited action on
the legislation so Bush could make the determination before visiting
Poland early next month.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, the Finance Committee chairman,
urged approval of the legislation, noting Poland's low per capita
income and the government's moves toward democracy.

<HEAD>East-West Conference Closes with Criticism of Bulgaria, Romania</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE GANLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An East-West conference on human rights ended Friday
with bitter attacks on Bulgaria and Romania for flouting human
rights accords during the month-long meeting in which they took part.
   Delegations from the 35 nations at Conference on the Human
Dimension generally applauded the results, but several Western
nations closed with final attacks on Bulgaria and Romania for
disregarding the accords.
   The Soviet Union, in its first public stance against an East bloc
ally, implicitly chastised Romania for building a barbed-wire fence
on its border with Hungary.
   ``The Helsinki Final Act makes no mention of a barbed wall,''
chief Soviet delegate Yuri Kashlev said at a news conference. ``If
we were the Romanians, we wouldn't have done it.''
   Hungarian authorities announced this week that Romania, already
under criticism for its treatment of dissidents and ethnic
minorities, has been building a barbed-wire fence on its border.
   While the delegates met, the rate of expulsions of ethnic Turks
living in Bulgaria mounted. An estimated 50,000 have been expelled
or invited to leave on short notice. The move follows resistance by
Bulgaria's ethnic Turkish population to an assimilation campaign
begun in 1984.
   Chief U.S. delegate Morris B. Abram said he was ``outraged'' at
the conduct of Bulgaria and Romania. ``We are, and every delegate
here should be, offended at the contempt that these countries have
shown for their neighbors,'' he said in a final address.
   French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas called on Bulgaria to end
the exodus, while chief Dutch delegate Max Van der Stoel called it a
``human tragedy'' and denounced the Romanian fence as ``a new iron
curtain in the heart of Europe.''
   The Paris conference is the first of three human rights meetings
being held by the Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe
in the framework of the 1975 Helsinki accords.
   ``We have taken yet another step to consolidate the humanitarian
breakthrough started in Vienna, from confrontation toward
interaction,'' Kashlev told the assembly.
   ``The Iron Curtain ... is melting at the edges,'' Abram said,
noting that Hungary challenged Romania and none of the delegates
stood up in defense of Bulgaria. ``I think we're beginning to see a
thaw.''
   Abram praised changes in Hungary, Poland and the Soviet Union.
   Under a four-tiered mechanism worked out in Vienna, the member
nations can call other nations to account for human rights abuses.
   Romania also drew criticism for rejecting the mechanism.
   At a bilateral meeting Friday, the Soviet Union informed the
United States that ``a number'' of pending emigration cases had been
resolved, Abram announced. He called the Soviet action ``one of the
effects of this meeting.''
   But the Soviet Union ``clearly has not gone far enough,'' he told
delegates.
   The United States has set conditions for attending a 1991
conference in Moscow: that there be no ``backsliding'' on human
rights; that there be clear progress; and that free access to
protesters, dissidents and non-governmental organizations be
guaranteed.
   No final document of the conference's work was issued, and none
of the more than 30 proposals tabled was adopted. The proposals are
to be taken up at the next meeting in Copenhagen in 1990 and in
Moscow.

<HEAD>Bush Gets Emergency Spending Bill Without Antidrug Extras</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House on Friday sent to President Bush a
$3.5 billion emergency spending bill for veterans, education,
refugee assistance and other programs requiring a cash infusion this
year.
   The fiscal 1989 supplemental appropriations bill, approved by the
Senate Thursday night, passed the House 318-6 only two days after
the chamber rejected a version that would have sparked a veto fight
with the president.
   President Bush was expected to sign the revised bill, which was
stripped of $821 million House Democrats had earmarked for anti-drug
programs. The White House contended federal agencies already had all
the money they could spend this year.
   The new version adds just $75 million for the anti-drug effort,
with that money coming from deferring spending on two other programs
until fiscal 1990.
   ``Either we ought to get in there and try to win the war on drugs
or we ought to get out of there,'' said Rep. Neal Smith, D-Iowa, who
promised to fight again for increased anti-drug spending in the
future.
   ``What we have established so far is that the administration
supports wide-ranging drug legislation but does not... support the
kind of resources that are necessary to make it effective,'' said
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash.
   Despite continuing arguments over the drug money and some other
items in the bill, the House overwhelmingly decided it could no
longer continue fighting and leave veterans facing health care
cutbacks over Congress' fourth of July recess.
   The largest single item in the bill is $1.2 billion for the
Department of Veterans Affairs, of which $340 million is for medical
care. Compensation and pensions, loans and other veterans programs
also would get more money.
   The bill also covers a mosaic of other federal programs lawmakers
said could not wait until the next fiscal year for more money.
   Those include nearly $900 million to the federal guaranteed
student loan program, $342 million to cover the cost of fighting
last year's widespread forest fires, and $423 million for foster
care and adoption.
   The food stamp program would be increased $225 million and aid to
the unemployed $90 million. An estimated 24,500 Soviet refugees
would be aided as a result of $100 million in new assistance
allocated for them and emigres from Eastern Europe, Africa and Asia.
   Congress' budget rules say the bill must contain money only for
``dire emergencies,'' but lawmakers took advantage of the must-pass
nature of the legislation to attach their favorite projects.
   Senate Appropriations Committee chairman Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va.,
in the compromise cut in half the $75 million he had inserted for
rebuilding a radiotelescope for scientists in his home state. He
agreed to wait until next year to provide the rest of the money.
   The balance of the $75 million allocated for the drug programs
would come from deferring some agriculture spending.
   The bill also would:
   _Add $90 million for benefits and training for the unemployed.
   _Provide $6.6 million to continue subsidies of air passenger
service to small communities which commercial companies would
otherwise drop from their schedules.
   _Require the installation of devices at airports which could
detect plastic explosives.
   _Earmark $125 million for United Nations peacekeeping activities.
   _Provide $1.5 million divided three ways for Puerto Rico's three
political parties for participation in determining the island's
future political status.

<HEAD>No Funds To Replace Lava-Destroyed National Park Visitor Center</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KALAPANA, Hawaii (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Park Service has no plans
for a new visitor center to replace the facility which was destroyed
by a lava flow, a spokesman said Friday.
   ``There is no money for it,'' said Jon Erickson, spokesman for
Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. ``We are contemplating an
information kiosk at the Kamoamoa Campground.''
   Lava from Kilauea Volcano crept beneath the raised, wooden
structures of the Waha'ula Visitor Center Thursday afternoon. The
main building burst into flames after park rangers, who were aiming
fire hoses on the 2,200-degree molten lava, ran out of water.
   The three buildings were destroyed in less than an hour, ending a
two-day effort to save the facility.
   Park officials earlier had removed anything that was not nailed
down in the $600,000 visitor center. A nearby maintenance complex
and power generation facility, valued at $400,000, was wiped out
early Wednesday.
   More than 200 visitors and dozens of park personnel watched
helpessly as the 24-year-old complex was destroyed.
   The Waha'ula Heiau, an ancient Hawaiian temple estimated to be
more than 700 years old, and three park ranger homes on the grounds
of the visitor center were spared, Erickson said.
   The flow was moving westward Friday toward the campground, about
two miles away, Erickson. The only stucture there burned in an
unrelated fire several weeks ago, he said.
   The eruption began Jan. 3, 1983, at a vent in the volcano's east
rift zone, about seven miles from the visitor center.
   Lava has destroyed 68 homes in the surrounding area.

   Ms. Ian had a No. 1 hit in 1975 with ``At Seventeen.'' She last

when asked about the middle-of-the-road direction her career has
taken.
   ``I think God gave me a talent (and) the kind of personality that

   ``I'm the kind of person who would rather rock in my rocking

   The new album features a twangy single called ``Why'd you come in

   Parton won the Country Music Association award as entertainer of

   Running back Ickey Woods denied reports that
he was involved in the cocaine relapse of Cincinnati Bengals
teammate Stanley Wilson.
   ``I was not with him. I was with three other guys watching the
Super Bowl special,'' Woods said Thursday at a juvenile home during
a streetwise talk against drugs. ``He's trying to insinuate that we
were selling. It's put a lot of endorsements on hold. People don't
know if I was with him.''
   Woods, who became an instant star last season with his ``Ickey
Shuffle'' after he scored touchdowns, took Wilson's place as a
Bengal starter last season before Wilson was kicked out of the
National Football League for his drug relapse.
   Woods said Wilson named him and other players in a
yet-unpublished Penthouse magazine interview as a way of making
money.
   ``He's got the top players on the team listed,'' Woods said.
``Nothing I can do _ just keep coming out and clearing my name.''
   Woods sidestepped a question from one of the youths whether he
had ever sold drugs as a youth in Fresno, his hometown.
   ``I'm not going to incriminate myself and say I did or not,''
Woods said. ``I was once in you guys' shoes.''
   Drugs are ``not the way for any of you guys,'' Woods said. ``I
know where you come from. I grew up in a neighborhood where you had
to be tough.''

   A flag from outer space joined super-absorbent
diapers, a Teflon frying pan and heated ski boots on Friday at an
exhibit of ``space spinoffs'' _ everyday products developed through
space research.
   Astronaut Jerry Ross took an official Museum of Science and
Industry flag into space on the 1988 Atlantis space shuttle mission,
and returned the flag to the museum as a memento for the exhibit.
   ``Even though we put a little over 1.8 million miles on that flag
in four days,'' it's still in good shape, Ross said as he presented
the royal blue and white nylon flag bearing the museum's name and
initials.
   Ross, 41, a native of nearby Crown Point, Ind., used to visit the
museum as a boy, and wanted to take on the Atlantis mission a
reminder of a place that helped spark his interest in space.
   ``It captured my imagination and helped foster the goals I had''
of becoming an astronaut, he told a small crowd gathered at the
South Side museum.
   The flag was stored in a vacuum-sealed container in a sub-floor
portion of the spacecraft during the December flight, Ross said. It
will be displayed permanently at the museum.
   While the flag doesn't exactly qualify as a ``space spinoff,'' it
easily upstaged the 100 such items on display for several little
boys whose eyes sparkled with delight as they watched Ross, wearing
his dark blue spacesuit, present the flag to James Kahn, the
museum's director.
   The real space spinoffs are consumer products and industrial
processes that were developed through three decades of space
research.
   More than 30,000 items, including Velcro and the Jarvik
artificial heart, have been developed from technology associated
with the nation's space program.
   One display case features a shiny potato chip bag made from a
material similar to that which formed the skin of a radio satellite
used in the 1960s.
   Another contains a pair of ski boots equipped with a
battery-operated heating element that can be turned on or off. The
boots were patterned after boot liners for lunar spacesuits.
   And there's a ceramic tennis racket and fishing reel developed
from early use of graphite composite materials during the 1973
Skylab missions.
   Ross also donated to the exhibit a photograph he took of Chicago
while traveling 5 miles a second about 270 miles above Earth.
   The museum shows up on the picture as a miniscule dot adjacent to
the Lake Michigan shoreline.
   The traveling exhibit, which originated in Fort Worth, Texas,
opened June 19 in Chicago. In September it will travel to science
museums in Boston, Philadelphia and other cities. It was designed
and produced by the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History.

   Eleven senators will visit Geneva and Vienna
next week to observe US-Soviet arms control negotiations on nuclear,
chemical and conventional weapons.
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., who is leading the delegation, said
Friday the delegation intends to remind Soviet negotiators in Geneva
and Vienna ``that the Senate will need to be confident that we can
prevent cheating in any successful treaty.''
   Lugar is co-chairman of the U.S. Senate Arms Control Observer
Group, which has monitored arms control negotiations since 1985. The
delegation was planning to leave as early as Saturday, depending on
when the Senate could finish its business.
   The delegation will discuss strategic nuclear weapons at the
Strategic Arms Reduction Talks and examine prospects for eliminating
chemical weapons at the Conference on Disarmament, both in Geneva.
They will then spend two days at the conventional weapons talks in
Vienna before returning to Washington on June 30.
   Members of the observer group are Lugar, and Sens. Claiborne

   The Senate earlier this week approved a resolution declaring
support for a verifiable and stabilizing strategic arms treaty and
urging President Bush to work closely with the Senate and U.S.
allies as the negotiations proceed.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, expressed hope
that the Bush administration ``will devote its energies to solving
such issues as whether to ban mobile missiles and sea-launched
nuclear cruise missiles and devising counting rules for missiles
carried on bombers.
   ``There is a clear need to forge a unified and creative approach
to these issues at the START negotiations,'' Mitchell said.
   Mitchell said the involvement of the Senate observer group in the
various arms control talks will enhance ``the ongoing process of
dialogue and consultation between the Senate and the executive
branch on arms control.''

   President Bush reassured senators Friday of the
United States' ``unwavering and unquestioned support'' of Israel
after questions were raised by a speech given by Secretary of State
James A. Baker III.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush
``reaffirmed the United States' commitment to Israel, speaking of
our unwaving and unquestioned support. He said Israel is a steadfast
ally and friend.''
   Moreover, Fitzwater reiterated that the United States views
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzkhak Shamir's proposal for elections in
the occupied territories as ``a very helpful proposal that we want
to pursue with all the parties in the region.''
   The senators asked for a meeting with the president after Baker
said last month that Israel should renounce ``the unrealistic vision
of a greater Israel,'' meaning the Jewish state should forswear
annexation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Baker also urged Israel to stop settlement activity in the
occupied lands and allow Palestinian schools to reopen. The speech
did not represent a change in U.S. policy but the tone of Baker's
remarks was viewed as a toughening of U.S. rhetoric.
   Shamir called Baker's speech ``useless.''
   After the meeting with Bush, Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said
``there has been some misinterpretation'' of U.S. policy.
   ``But I don't think that the president could have been stronger
in indicating the recognition on the part of the United States that
Israel is our strongest ally in the Middle East and a reaffirmation
of continued concern and assistance and working together.''
   Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., said the meeting was intended ``to
make sure that we all understood where the president was with regard
to his view on the elections policy proposed by the Israeli
government.
   ``And he reinforced to us that he believed it was extremeley
useful and an extremely courageous move by the Shamir government and
that he was strongly supportive of that initiative,'' Biden said.
   Biden said Bushed wanted to dispel the notion that Baker's speech
was a change in policy.
   ``There is no change in policy on the part of the United
States,'' Biden said after the meeting. ``Israel is the first among
equals in the region and Israel, in fact, is going through a
difficult period that the president fully understands and fully
intends on continuing to support.''

   Moslem leader Salim Hoss on Friday
attacked militia leaders suspected of illegal taxation and shady
deals, and accused them of kidnapping a government official.
   Also Friday, police said Israeli troops and allied militiamen
advanced into southeast Lebanon and attacked pro-Iranian guerrillas.
Hezbollah said two of its guerrillas were killed in the attack. But
Israel denied its troops left their self-designated security zone.
   Hoss' attack Friday, his strongest yet on the unruly militias,
came as Syrian and Christian gunners traded howitzer shells in
Beirut and Christian commander Gen. Michel Aoun urged Lebanese
around the world to stage protests to focus attention on the
country's problems.
   Hoss, Lebanon's acting prime minister and leader of the Moslem
Cabinet in the divided government, did not identify the militias he
believes responsible for Wednesday's abduction of Raja Bsat, in
charge of importing grain and sugar.
   A previously unknown group, calling itself Father of the Poor,
said it kidnapped Bsat in Syrian-policed west Beirut to protest a
bread shortage.
   Hoss blamed shortages on ``leaders who have become merchants'' _
apparently referring to leaders of various Moslem and leftist
militias accused of making big profits from shady deals.
   Private citizens, politicians who do not belong to militia
factions and moderate government leaders privately have complained.
They claim militia leaders bomb power lines and block fuel supplies
to power stations to force people to buy auxiliary generators
imported by them.
   Hoss, in a statement on local radio stations, accused such
militias of kidnapping Bsat to ``cover up for their crimes.''
   The prime minister, who does not have a political party or
militia, said he is ``aware of the population's plight,'' including
illegal taxation. He did not offer any solutions, however.
   Militias collect customs dues in illegal ports they run and levy
taxes in their areas of influence.
   A police spokesman said Syrian gunners fired about 20 shells
Friday to maintain their blockade of Christian ports north of Beirut.
   Christian gunners responded with 155mm howitzers, the spokesman
said. Witnesses said Christian shells damaged some cars. No one one
was reported injured.
   Current fighting broke out March 8, pitting Aoun's 20,000 troops
against three times as many Syrian and allied forces.
   By police count, 373 people have been killed and 1,457 wounded in
the confrontation that continues despite repeated Arab calls for a
cease-fire.
   Fighting started after Aoun blockaded illegal ports run by
Syrian-backed militias. Syrian and allied forces retaliated by
besieging Beirut's Christian enclave.
   Aoun on Friday protested ``the silence practiced by the world
regarding the killing of Lebanon (by Syria).''
   He called on ``the Lebanese and their friends in the world to
stage sit-ins near the U.S. and Soviet embassies all over the world
as of Monday.''
   He said he hopes to pressure Syria into accepting a cease-fire.
   Israeli army officials, meanwhile, denied their troops left their
self-designated security zone to attack guerrillas of Hezbollah, or
Party of God. They said their militia allies, the South Lebanon
Army, carried out the ``initiative actions.''
   But police and witnesses said a column of 300 troops protected by
armored personnel carriers and artillery barrage that advanced into
southeastern Lebanon included Israeli soldiers and were backed by
three Israeli helicopter gunships.

<HEAD>U.S. Soldier Apologizes For Espionage, Asks Forgiveness</HEAD>

   An American soldier broke down in
tears during his court-martial on espionage charges Friday and
pleaded for forgiveness for handing U.S. Army defense secrets to
communist East Germany.
   ``I'm sorry for what I've done,'' Spec. 4 Michael A. Peri sobbed
during his testimony. ``I just want forgiveness from the unit and
the Corps,'' he said.
   The defendant also said he received no money from the East
Germans.
   In testimony earlier Friday, Peri's commander said the
information Peri gave East Germany was crucial and concerned the
Army's electronic defense capabilities.
   Peri, 22, of Laguna Niguel, Calif., pleaded guilty Wednesday to
charges he gave defense secrets to East Germany during his
disappearance in February from his unit in Fulda.
   He worked as an electronic signal interceptor in the S-2
intelligence section of the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment.
   Peri disappeared from his unit Feb. 20, crossing the border into
East Germany with a small computer and computer discs containing
classified information. He returned March 4 and was arrested.
   Peri said he returned ``because I couldn't handle leaving my
parents behind, my friends behind. Taking what I had coming was
better.''
   Peri's parents, Fred and Winnie Peri, sat in the back of the
courtroom, holding hands and sobbing.
   Under questioning from his attorney, Maj. William G. Stokes, Peri
cited job pressures and a lack of privacy in Army life as the
reasons for his actions.
   Peri said that during his stay in East Germany, communist
security officials in civilian clothes interrogated him at a house
north of East Berlin.
   Just before leaving East Germany, Peri said, he asked communist
officials to hand back the computer and discs, and they complied.
   U.S. military prosecutors say it appears the East Germans copied
the discs before giving them back.
   Asked by Stokes if he was given money by the East Germans for the
information, Peri replied: ``No, I was not, sir.''
   Peri's parents also testified, saying there had never been any
indication such a serious thing could happen to their son.
   ``He was a perfect child, he never gave us any problems,'' his
mother said.
   The defendant's father, a civil engineer, said, ``I'm proud to
call him my son.''
   Col. John N. Abrams, Peri's commander, testified the defendant
was a valuable part of the unit's intelligence section.
   Asked by chief prosecutor Maj. Michael D. Graham how he assessed
the damage done by Peri's actions, Abrams said: ``Those plans (taken
by Peri) show the wisdom and judgment of the field commander who is
directing the battle.''
   Abrams said one part of the classified plan Peri gave away
``shows how I will specifically distribute and organize electronic
warfare.''
   Also Friday, an Army psychiatrist described an examination
conducted on Peri after his arrest.
   ``He was so wrapped up with himself that he could not make
connection with others, either male or female,'' said Col. Robert G.
Schearer, chief of the psychiatry section of the 97th General
Hospital in Frankfurt.
   ``It is our belief that he is not getting messages from the real
world,'' Schearer testified. But he said he believes Peri knows
right from wrong.
   In addition to espionage, Peri is charged with being absent
without leave, wrongfully appropriating government property, and
entering a restricted zone without permission.
   He faces up to life imprisonment on the espionage charge.
   Closing statements were scheduled Saturday.

   Israeli troops and allied Lebanese
Christian militia advanced Friday on southeast Lebanon and attacked
pro-Iranian guerrillas, police said.
   Israeli military officials initially said they were not involved,
but an army spokeswoman said later that Israeli troops participated
in one of two attacks staged by their militia allies, the South
Lebanon Army.
   Four guerrillas were killed and one soldier was slightly wounded,
the spokeswoman said.
   Hezbollah, or Party of God, said at least two of its guerrillas
were killed and two wounded.
   About 300 Israeli troops and Christian militiamen advanced in 35
armored personnel carriers amid a barrage of artillery fire while
three Israeli helicopter gunships hovered above, Lebanese police
said.
   Attackers fought their way into the villages of Kawkaba,
Dellafeh, Kfar Houna and Mydoun, three to four miles north of the
security zone in the Syrian-controlled western Bekaa valley, said a
police spokesman.
   They blew up several houses in searches for suspected Hezbollah
guerrillas, said the spokesman who cannot be named under standing
regulations.
   Villagers fled to towns to the north, he added.
   The Israeli army spokeswoman said Israel's ``action outside the
security zone was designed to foil the organization and activities
of the terrorists.''
   She said the guerrillas fired Katyusha rockets into the security
zone during the attack.
   Lebanese police said five howitzer shells from the attackers fell
near Syrian army positions 2 miles north of the villages, but the
Syrians did not retaliate.
   Israel carved out the security zone when it withdrew the bulk of
its invading army from south Lebanon in summer 1985, ending a
three-year occupation.
   It uses the six- to 10-mile-deep enclave as a buffer against
cross-border guerrilla attacks. Israeli troops and South Lebanon
Army militiamen patrol the zone.

<HEAD>Bill Would Reduce Troop In Korea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four Democratic lawmakers introduced
legislation Friday withdrawing 10,000 U.S. troops from South Korea
by 1992, arguing that the Asian nation must assume a greater defense
burden.
   ``More than 35 years after the end of the Korean War, we still
maintain 43,000 troops in South Korea,'' said Sen. Dale Bumpers of
Arkansas. ``The rationale for this presence, which costs $2.6
billion a year, has grown weaker every year as the South Korean
economy has gotten stronger.''
   Bumpers and Sen. Bennett Johnston of Louisiana joined Lloyd
Bentsen of Texas and Kent Conrad of North Dakota in sponsoring the
bill that requires pulling out 10,000 Army personnel over three
years.
   About 21,000 troops and two Air Force wings of about 12,000
troops would remain.
   The measure also would require President Bush to report to
Congress by May 1990 on withdrawing all U.S. forces from South Korea.
   The United States should ``allow the South Koreans to more fully
shoulder the burden of defending themselves against their poorer,
smaller neighbor to the north,'' Bumpers said.
   On Thursday, a handful of Democratic lawmakers urged Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney to reject any agreement with South Korea that
would require the United States to maintain troops at current levels.
   Members cited a recent letter that South Korean Defense Minister
Lee Sang-Hoon sent to Cheney asking the United States to promise not
to withdraw American troops.
   At a hearing of the Senate Appropriations defense subcommittee,
Bumpers argued that South Korea's gross national product is seven
times that of North Korea, its population twice that of North Korea
and it only spends 5 percent of its GNP on defense.
   Cheney said the United States has no plans to reduce the U.S.
committment to Korea, but that cuts in troop levels are possible,
``just as there is a proposal to reduce our troop level in Europe.''

   The remains of five U.S. servicemen killed in
Vietnam have been identified and will be returned to the continental
United States next week, the Pentagon said Friday.
   Officials at Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii identified the
remains of four servicemen reported missing in North Vietnam and one
reported missing in South Vietnam. The remains will be returned to
Travis Air Force Base in California on June 27, the Defense
Department said.
   The five identified were:
   _Air Force Col. Gerald W. Alley of Pocatello, Idaho, who was
reported missing in North Vietnam on Dec. 22, 1972. Alley was born
July 28, 1934.
   _Air Force Lt. Col. Robert A. Stubberfield, Stockton, Calif.,
reported missing in North Vietnam on May 6, 1965. Stubberfield was
born Nov. 30, 1929.
   _Navy Lt. Cmdr. Claude D. Wilson Jr., of Stockton, Calif.,
reported missing in North Vietnam on Dec. 14, 1966. Wilson was born
Aug. 14, 1935.
   _Air Force Capt. Joseph B. Copack, Jr., of Chicago, Ill.,
reported missing in North Vietnam on Dec. 22, 1972. Copack was born
June 4, 1947.
   _Marine Corps Sgt. Edwin R. Grissett, Jr., of San Juan, Texas,
reported missing in South Vietnam on Jan. 22, 1966. Grissett was
born Sept. 19, 1943.
   The remains of Grissett were among 25 repatriated by Vietnam in
January of this year, and the second to be identified from that
group. The four other remains were among 38 repatriated by Vietnam
on Dec. 15, 1988. Twenty-four of those remains have been identified.

   A severe shortage of covered hopper cars to
carry grain will develop by the end of this century unless railroads
buy new ones, an Agriculture Department official said Friday.
   Martin ``Buzz'' Fitzpatrick Jr., administrator of the
department's Office of Transportation, said grain shippers
experienced severe car shortages a year ago and could run into them
again as early as 1991.
   ``In early 1988 there was a two- to six-week delay for shippers
in getting grain cars,'' he said. ``For some shippers, the delay was
as high as 14 weeks.''
   Fitzpatrick said a study at the time showed the cause was a
``shrinking and aging'' grain car fleet, combined with increased
demand, particularly for grain exports.
   A recent follow-up study shows that since 1982 virtually no new
cars have been added to the nations rail-car fleet. At the same
time, more cars are being lost each year as the result of accidents,
derailments and retirements because of age.
   ``The bottom line is that today's fleet of 98,600 cars used for
grain shipments will drop to 66,300 by they year 2001,'' Fitzpatrick
said. ``Our study shows the peak fleet requirement for that year to
be 96,000 cars _ resulting in a projected deficit of nearly 30,000
cars.''
   Currently, railroads own about 60 percent of the jumbo
covered-hopper grain cars, and shippers own the rest.
   ``If this ratio is to be maintained, the primary burden of adding
new rail cars for grain shipments lies with the railroads, because
82 percent of the cars over 20 years old are owned by the
railroads,'' he said.
   Fitzpatrick spoke at a luncheon for transportation writers
sponsored by the National Press Club.

<HEAD>Opposition Agrees On Single Candidate To Challenge Pinochet</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Centrist politician Patricio Aylwin won
the backing Friday of three key socialist groups, ensuring he will
be the candidate of a united opposition in elections to pick Gen.
Augusto Pinochet's successor.
   The army, meanwhile, warned that it would use force if necessary
to defend Pinochet's right to remain their commander after the
December vote.
   Two major Socialist Party factions and the pro-socialist Party
for Democracy announced they are setting aside ideological
differences to support Aylwin, a Christian Democrat, in his bid to
be ``the democratic president of all Chileans.''
   Aylwin, in a speech accepting the parties' support, emphasized
the ``urgency for unity'' in the opposition.
   ``We have been adversaries in the past,'' the 70-year-old lawyer
and former Senate president told his leftist allies. ``But the time
has come to put aside our differences, and work together to rebuild
democracy.''
   As the ceremony came to an end, the dissidents spontaneously sang
the national anthem.
   With Friday's endorsements, Aylwin has won support from all the
main groups in the 17-party opposition coalition. He will be
formally nominated by the entire coalition July 4, said Claudio
Vasquez, a coalition leader.
   Aylwin, president of the Christian Democratic Party, the
country's largest, was the opposition's chief spokesman in its
successful campaign for Pinochet's defeat in a referendum last
October. Voters rejected a military proposal that Pinochet remain in
power until 1997.
   The referendum defeat obliged Pinochet, who has ruled since a
bloody 1973 coup, to call presidential and congressional elections
scheduled for Dec. 14.
   The new government is to take power March 11, 1990.
   Opinion polls indicate Aylwin is likely to defeat any rightist
pro-government candidate. Conservative pro-government forces have
yet to agree on a candidate, but the most probable appears to be
Sergio Onofre Jarpa, a 68-year-old former senator and interior
minister under Pinochet.
   Jarpa, however, has met opposition among the most staunchly
pro-Pinochet groups, who support Hernan Buchi, Pinochet's
40-year-old former finance minister. Buchi has said he will not run
but is reportedly reconsidering his decision.
   Most legal experts say Pinochet is barred from running by a
constitutional clause prohibiting presidential re-election. Although
he has flip-flopped on the issue in the past, Pinochet on Tuesday
said he would not be a candidate.
   Ricardo Lagos, president of the Party for Democracy, said the
17-party opposition coalition already has reached ``a global
agreement'' to nominate Aylwin.
   ``Chile's interests are above the interests of our parties,''
Lagos said. ``We are not going to elect just a president. We are
going to elect the man who will rebuild a democratic system that has
been trampled by the dictatorship.''
   If elected, Aylwin said, his government will seek justice for the
victims of human rights violations under the Pinochet government and
punishment for those found responsible.
   ``That is an open wound which will not heal unless the truth is
discovered and justice is achieved,'' Aylwin said. ``But we'll seek
justice, not revenge.''
   The opposition has said Pinochet must relinquish command of the
powerful 60,000-member armed forces.
   But in statement read Friday by Col. Fritz Ladevig, the army said
it ``has the unavoidable mission to safeguard the constitutional
order, either through respresentations or, in their absence, through
the use of legitimate force.''
   The constitution, pushed through by Pinochet's administration in
1980, allows all armed forces chiefs to remain in their posts for
eight more years.

<HEAD>Baseball Has Substantial Evidence Against Rose, Investigator Says</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Recasts lead to move higher ruling set for noon Sunday.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE KAY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge who was told that evidence shows Pete
Rose bet on his own team said today he would rule at noon Sunday on
a request by the Cincinnati Reds manager to delay a meeting with
baseball's commissioner.
   John M. Dowd outlined the evidence, saying his investigation
found telephone records, taped conversations, checks signed by Rose,
and ``betting sheets'' that have been verified as bearing Rose's
handwriting.
   The evidence is substantial, with nine witnesses giving
information about Rose betting on baseball games, including Reds
contests, Dowd said.
   While defending his report Thursday against attacks by Rose's
lawyers, Dowd said he's taken no enjoyment from presenting the case
against Rose, who has the most career hits.
   ``Do I like it? No,'' Dowd said. ``There isn't a day I haven't
felt enormous sadness about this matter.''
   Dowd unveiled the case against Rose during a hearing for Rose's
lawsuit against baseball Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti.
   Rose sued him earlier this week, asserting the commissioner is
biased and has already decided against him.
   The hearing Thursday was on Rose's request for a temporary
restraining order that would block his Monday meeting with Giamatti
in New York _ the final step before the commissioner decides the
case.
   If Giamatti determines Rose bet on Reds games _ which the manager
has steadfastly denied _ he could ban him from baseball for life.
   Dowd was questioned today by Rose's lawyers to complete the
hearing. Hamilton County Common Pleas Judge Norbert A. Nadel said he
would issue a ruling Sunday.
   Under pointed cross-examination by Robert G. Stachler, one of
Rose's lawyers, Dowd said repeatedly that Giamatti has not yet
decided Rose's fate.
   Dowd repeated today that corroborative evidence indicated Peters
was being truthful when he said Rose bet on Reds' games. But he
became testy when Stachler rephrased his questions several times in
an attempt to get Dowd to say Giamatti had made a determination in
the case when he sent the letter on behalf of bookmaker Ronald
Peters to a federal judge as part of the Peters' sentencing.
   On Thursday, baseball attorney Louis L. Hoynes Jr. told Nadel
that it's important to let the commissioner use his full authority
in deciding Rose's case.
   ``What's at stake here is the integrity of the game of
major-league baseball,'' Hoynes said.
   The evidence is contained in a 225-page report by Dowd and seven
volumes of exhibits that were wheeled into the courtroom Thursday.
Nadel has decided to keep the report confidential, against Hoynes'
wishes.
   ``There is evidence, substantial and heavily corroborated
evidence, that Mr. Rose bet large sums of money on major-league
baseball games and on games of the Cincinnati Reds,'' Hoynes said.
   Hoynes' and Dowd's statements were the first confirmation by the
commissioner's office that it had evidence Rose bet on baseball
games.
   Dowd explained that the report involves testimony and evidence
from more than 80 witnesses and is broken into segments. It opens
with a summary of the findings and is followed by a chronological
narrative of the investigation.
   Of the nine witnesses who supplied information that Rose bet on
baseball and Reds' games, only two have been in trouble with the
law, Dowd said, blunting contentions by Rose's lawyers that the
report was based on the testimony of criminals.
   Nine other witnesses told the investigators that Rose didn't bet
on baseball.
   Rose's lawyers are trying to get the judge to disqualify Giamatti
on grounds he's already decided that Rose is guilty, thus depriving
the manager of a fair hearing next week.
   ``The basic foundation of a fair hearing is missing,'' Stachler
told Nadel.
   Baseball's lawyers provided a memorandum Thursday from Giamatti,
who said he hasn't yet made up his mind on the case.

   Police used guard dogs to disperse
about 300 farmers and lawmakers outside the National Congress on
Friday, demanding land for peasants. About 10 demonstrators were
injured, a radio report said.
   It was the first time authorities acted publicly to quell dissent
since Gen. Andres Rodriguez ousted Gen. Alfredo Stroessner on Feb.
3. Rodriguez was elected president May 1.
   Most of the injured were bitten by the dogs but none was
seriously hurt, according to Radio Caritas, a Roman Catholic station.
   Among the injured were national Deputy Juan Carlos Galaverna of
the governing Colorado Party and legislators of several opposition
parties.
   Alberto Alderete, leader of the Popular Democratic Movement, also
was at the demonstration.
   ``This repression is shameful and it shows that Gen. Rodriguez is
more ferocious than Stroessner,'' he said. ``To go on like this is
to move toward dictatorship.''
   Luis Andrada Nogues of the Christian Democratic Party said: ``Now
the false promises are over. ... The people need land to live and to
work.''

<HEAD>Captured Crew to Get Medals 20 Years Later</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   More than 20 years after North Korea's capture
of the spy ship USS Pueblo, the U.S. government on Friday reversed
itself and agreed to give medals to all 82 aboard who were held
captive and tortured for 11 months.
   Vice Admiral J.M. Boorda, chief of naval personnel, told a House
Armed Services subcommittee of the decision at a hearing that
featured emotional testimony from Lloyd Bucher, the Pueblo's retired
commander.
   ``The Navy feels that the circumstances of Pueblo meet the spirit
and intent'' of a medal for prisoners of war established by Congress
in 1985, Boorda said in testimony he said was specifically
authorized by the Pentagon and the Bush administration.
   ``I personally feel that we as a nation should recognize the
sacrifices made by these crew members,'' he said. ``They have earned
it.''
   Bucher said his men had been ``dumbfounded, justifiably angry and
deeply hurt'' when they at first were denied POW medals. That was
due to a finding by Pentagon lawyers that they were techically
detainees rather than prisoners of war because there was no open
conflict between the United States and North Korea at the time of
the Jan. 23, 1968 capture.
   His voice halted as he concluded his testimony: ``Mr. Chairman,
those men were America's sons. They did as bid by this country, and
more.''
   In an interview later, he called the legal reasoning behind the
denial of medals ``contrived'' and said it hid the real reason the
medals were denied:
   ``They were looking at us like something you'd want to put under
the rug. It was a calamity for our country, to be captured at noon
on the high seas... It's an embarrassment to a lot of people. It's
gone down as something that most elements of our government would
rather forget about.''
   Bucher's surrender of his small ship, loaded with intelligence
information, was harshly criticized later and he even was
recommended for a court martial, although that request was denied.
   ``I don't appreciate being second-guessed, but I know it's
inevitable in this world,'' Bucher said. ``It's been kind of an
uphill battle'' to win the recognition he said his crew deserves.
   Most of the crew members were teenagers at the time of the
capture, he said. During their captivity, they were beaten with
pieces of lumber, burned on radiators and had their teeth kicked out
by North Korean soldiers.
   ``Those guys went from teenage to adulthood in one hell of a
hurry, and they did it with a degree of dignity and courage that has
never been exceeded in the history of this county's military,''
Bucher said.
   Rep. Jim Slattery, D-Kan., has introduced legislation
specifically recognizing the the Pueblo crew _ 77 of whom are still
alive _ as eligible for the POW medal. Slattery said he was alterted
to the problem by a crew member, Steven Woelk of McLouth, Kan., who
was permanently disabled in the attack.
   Boorda said the Pentagon would support legislation to amend the
law so the Pueblo crew could receive the POW medal.

<HEAD>Master Teddy To Stay in $102,000 Dog House _ Untattooed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Master Teddy, a white Spitz who lives in a
$102,000 dog house, won't have to get his leg tattooed to satisfy
heirs of his former owner that a look-alike canine won't move in
when Teddy dies.
   The six heirs gave up their legal battle Friday, but the aging
Teddy will have to give up some of the privacy of his three-bedroom,
Silver Spring home.
   ``Everybody's going to look at this dog _ everybody in the
world,'' said Karl G. Feissner, an attorney for the dog's caretaker.
   The agreement reached Friday will allow a detailed inspection of
the dog's body to satisfy all parties that another dog has not been
substituted.
   The caretaker and Teddy's veterinarian said tattooing the dog's
hind leg would inflict needless trauma on him, since the animal
could be identified by photographs and X-rays.
   ``I think they're nuts,'' said caretaker George J. Schnabele, 74,
a retired policeman who has known Teddy since puppyhood. ``I don't
know what the relatives are thinking of.''
   Ralph Gordon, who represents the heirs, said his clients did not
want publicity and refused to discuss the case.
   When Celeste V. Crawford died of cancer in 1984, her will said
Teddy could live in her home the rest of his life. Schnabele, who
has rented the basement apartment since 1968, would be permitted to
stay there to look after the pet.
   The bequest upset Mrs. Crawford's sisters and brothers, who went
to court seeking permission to sell the house and divide the
proceeds. But a Montgomery County Circuit judge ruled three years
ago they would have to wait until the dog's death.
   Teddy has turned out to be resilient. He is now 13 years old _
the equivalent of 90 to 93 years old in human terms _ and could live
for several more years, said veterinarian K.T. Somaiah, who has
cared for the dog for 10 years.
   After losing their bid to sell the house, the heirs demanded the
dog be tattooed as a safeguard against possible dognapping. Another
veterinarian, Chester A. Anderson, said in an affidavit that
tattooing was a ``quick, painless and permanent method for
identifying a dog.''
   But Feissner disagreed, suggesting that if the judge approved the
tattoing, the heirs ``should be tattooed too so we know who's who.''
   Legal wrangling over the estate may not be over, said executor
Gilbert Tietz.
   ``Unfortunately, everything in this case has become a court
battle,'' he said.

<HEAD>New Colon Cancer Drug Approved</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration is allowing
expanded use of a new drug that shows promise in extending the lives
of gravely ill patients with advanced colon cancer.
   The agency approved more widespread use of the drug, levamisole,
without waiting for study results to be published because it ``shows
real promise of being very effective,'' said spokesman Jeff Nesbit.
   The drug is being made available for use with the approved cancer
drug 5-fluorouracil under the FDA's ``treatment investigational new
drug'' regulations. That status allows drug developers to release
promising drugs to gravely ill patients before complete information
on the drug's safety and effectiveness is available and sufficient
for commercial approval.
   The National Cancer Institute, which developed the drug,
estimated that 25,000 patients a year will be eligible for treatment
with levamisole.
   About a dozen drugs have been approved under similar
circumstances, the FDA said.
   Though the FDA has not released details on the effectiveness of
the drug, the FDA described the study results in general terms,
saying the combination of levamisole and 5-fluorouracil in patients
who had undergone surgical colon removal ``produced a significant
reduction in tumor recurrence and a delay in those recurrences that
did occur.''
   The Washington Post reported in its Thursday editions a dispute
between physicians who believe the decision should have awaited
publication of results on 408 patients in a forthcoming issue of the
Journal of Clinical Oncology and physicians who believe a clearly
beneficial drug should not be withheld until publication.
   Colon cancer is second only to lung cancer as a cause of death
from cancer in the United States. About 44,000 people in the United
States will die from colon cancer this year, and 110,000 new cases
will be diagnosed, the FDA said.

   Heavy rains sent torrents gushing through roads, homes and
businesses in 14 states Friday, extending a spate of flooding that
killed a Pennsylvania woman in her basement and swept away an
Oklahoma motorist.
   Houses were under water and people stranded in cars in Maryland,
and evacuations were reported in Kentucky. The flooding also led to
bridge inspections in New York and road closings in Pennsylvania,
Virginia and West Virginia.
   ``We had flash flooding in places we never had it before,'' said
Charles Brice, the county civil defense director in Oklahoma City.
``We have never experienced this much rain all at once and then the
ground being saturated didn't help matters.''
   Divers and lake patrol rangers searched a swollen central
Oklahoma creek for a driver missing after up to 7 inches of rain
fell in a few hours Thursday night. High waters forced at least 20
families to leave their homes temporarily and standed many motorists.
   ``We're getting the roads back in shape,'' Brice said. ``We
didn't experience as much damage as first anticipated.'' He said
authorities were still tallying the losses, including those at a day
care center whose roof collapsed two hours after the last of the
children left.
   The National Weather Service said June's rainfall total of 14.47
inches already has broken the record for the most rainfall in any
month in Oklahoma City.
   Several western New York communities declared emergencies as
raging creek waters fed by torrential rains swamped bridges,
inundated roads, flooded hundreds of basements and forced the
evacuation of dozens of people.
   In Arcade, where 3.5 inches of rain fell late Thursday evening,
Supervisor Howard Payne said the main street of the village
southeast of Buffalo had been under 3 feet of water.
   Flood waters flowed through the Hummingbird Toy Co. in Arcade,
carrying away 70,000 partly assembled yo-yos.
   ``It's incredible. Yo-yos will be floating down the Cattaraugus
Creek into Lake Erie for the next month,'' said owner Brad
Countryman, who estimated losses at $200,000.
   Residents of the Pittsburgh suburb of Etna pumped basements,
scraped mud and cleared debris following Thursday's heavy rain, and
across the state in Chester County, there was flooding Friday along
state Route 82.
   A 22-year-old woman with cerebral palsy drowned in the basement
of her home in Holland, just northeast of Philadelphia, on Thursday
after 2{ feet of water seeped in and tipped her wheelchair, police
said.
   No injuries were reported among Philadelphia-area motorists
stranded in high water that disrupted the afternoon rush hour
Thursday for drivers and rail commuters. The Southeastern
Pennsylvania Transportation Authority had to run buses to replace
trains shut down by flooding and power outages.
   In east-central Alabama, authorities estimated at least $2
million in damage from rain that flooded farmers' crops and
inundated homes.
   Flooding also was reported in Delaware, Georgia, Kentucky, New
Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee and Texas.

   The Soviet Union has bought an additional
96,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices, the
Agriculture Department said Friday.
   Christopher E. Goldthwait, acting general sales manager for the
department's Foreign Agricultural Service, said the wheat was sold
by Cargill Inc. and is scheduled for delivery by the end of the
month.
   The subsidy paid Cargill averaged $6.69 per ton, or about 18
cents per bushel. The total for the 96,000 tons _ about 3.5 million
bushels _ would be about $642,000.
   Moscow has bought more than 4.2 million tons of U.S. wheat for
1988-89 delivery at prices subsidized under the department's Export
Enhancement Program, or EEP.
   Although the Soviets had virtually used up the previous EEP
allocation, a new deal for an additional 1.5 million tons of wheat
was announced May 2. Goldthwaite said Moscow has 814,200 tons
remaining under the program.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat. According to the latest USDA five-day average, the price
of wheat has been $3.89 per bushel, meaning the latest sale could
have a farm value of around $13.6 million.
   Under EEP arrangements, private exporters can sell U.S.
commodities at reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition
in selected overseas markets and then collect free government
surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies.

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hospitalized caretaker Premier Andreas
Papandreou was asked Friday to try to form a new government after
leftist parties refused to join the Conservatives in an alliance.
   Greece's political impasse developed after no party or alliance
gained a majority in Sunday's election for the 300-member Parliament.
   Constantine Mitsotakis' conservative New Demoracy won a plurality
and 145 seats. The incumbent Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist
Movement, or PASOK, got 125 seats, and the Coalition of the Left and
Progress wound up as the power broker with 28. An independent and
small party won the two other seats.
   President Christos Sartzetakis first asked Mitsitakis to form a
new government, but he could not reach an arrangment with the
communist coalition.
   Sartzetakis then turned to Papandreou, who governed Greece for
eight years, with the last few years embroiled in scandals.
   Papandreou, 70, was admitted to an Athens hospital Thursday night
with breathing difficulties.
   One opposition newspaper questioned Papandreou's motives and
suggested he was seeking to avoid a political showdown.
   ``Using his sickness as an excuse, Andreas is leaving. He
definitely lost the game. He is withdrawing from the political
scene,'' said the afternoon daily Apoyevmatini.
   Sartzetakis phoned Papandreou at his hospital room and reportedly
told him he had until Tuesday night to form a government.
   Papandreou issued a statement saying he would try to reach
agreement with Harilaos Florakis, leader of the Coalition of Left
and Progress.
   ``In the next few days I will take the initiative to meet
coalition general secretary Mr. Florakis. During our talks I will
have the chance to present PASOK's positions and commitments for a
viable government,'' said Papandreou.
   Because of the continued uncertainty it was announced Sartzetakis
would replace Papandreou at a two-day summit meeting of the European
Economic Community opening Monday in Madrid.
   Medical bulletins said Papandreous is capable of handling the
duties of the premier's office, but he underwent heart surgery last
September in London and his health is fragile.
   A bulletin issued Friday by a medical team at General State
hospital said Papandreou had pneumonia. It did not say how long he
might remain in the hospital.
   After his final meeting with the president, Mitsotakis told a
news conference he was saddened by the leftist coalition's rejection
of his proposal to form an interim government.
   Coalition members are the Moscow-line Greek Communist Party and
the Eurocommunist Greek Left Party.
   Mitsotakis, 71, had been given 72 hours to form a government.
   ``I offered two crucial ministries to the left ... the Justice
Ministry and the Interior Ministry, the key ministry if one wants to
hold elections,'' he said.
   He added the Communist coalition now could be blamed if people in
Papandreou's government who were responsible of wrongdoings escaped
prosecution.
   Members of Papandreou's administration have been accused of
corrupt deals in arms and banking. A $200-million embezzlement
scandal involving the Bank of Crete resulted in the dismissals or
resignations of eight ministers.
   Two former PASOK ministers have been charged with receiving
payoffs from the former owner of the Bank of Crete, George Koskotas,
now in custody in the United States awaiting a hearing on his
extradition to Greece.
   Mitsotakis said a new government must be formed quickly in light
of a new scandal involving the National Mortgage Bank of Greece in
the United States.
   ``Greece is being shamed internationally. Something must be done
in order to prosecute the responsible parties,'' he said.
   Representatives of the National Mortgage Bank were arrested in
four U.S. cities on Wednesdy and charged with laundering about $700
million for movement out of the country.

<TEXT>
   The tanker Exxon Valdez on Friday
began its long, slow journey to San Diego for $25 million in
renovations to repair the hull it shredded on a reef three months
ago, causing the nation's worst oil spill.
   Seas were calm, but fog and a low ceiling shrouded the 987-foot
vessel as it lifted anchor and began moving under tow by two
tugboats, Exxon spokesman Henry Beathard said.
   A lone fishing boat, dwarfed by the crippled hulk of the tanker,
circled in silent protest as the ship was pulled from its protected
anchorage at Outside Bay on Naked Island.
   Thick cable and chains stretching from two 7,000-horsepower
tugboats formed a yoke for the tanker as it crept toward
Hinchenbrook Entrance and the Gulf of Alaska.
   A third tug was attached to the tanker's stern and a salvage boat
trailed not far behind. The end of the rain-drenched procession was
brought up by two escort vessels loaded with 9,000 feet of
containment boom and each carrying an oil skimming vessel with 4,000
barrels capacity.
   Progress was slow initially, and the tanker moved only about two
miles in the first two hours ``because of some turns it had to make
to get out in the channel,'' Beathard said.
   Once adjustments are made, the speed is expected to increase to
about 5 mph, meaning it should take about 20 days to cover the 2,500
miles to the San Diego drydock where it was built nearly three years
ago.
   ``I must say we're not sorry to see it go,'' Gov. Steve Cowper
said at a news conference in Juneau.
   The Coast Guard said there was minimal danger of additional
pollution from the ship as it moves down the West Coast about 100
miles offshore.
   ``It's stable and clean,'' Exxon spokesman Joe Tucker said. ``I
understand there are some fish swimming in one of the tanks.''
   An Exxon Shipping Co. official expressed optimism that the vessel
would make it to San Diego for its nine months' of repairs.
   ``If anybody thought there was a concern, the ship wouldn't be
going,'' said shipping coordinator Paul Meyers. ``Exxon is very
confident based on calculations and two months of work that it's
going to be OK.
   ``There is roughly a 1 percent chance that the vessel would
encounter a wave that could cause it a problem,'' said Meyers, who
was aboard an Exxon-chartered boat ferrying reporters and
photographers to watch the Exxon Valdez depart.
   The Exxon Valdez had been en route to Long Beach, Calif., on
March 24 when it struck Bligh Reef, bleeding nearly 11 million
gallons of North Slope crude oil into then-pristine Prince William
Sound.
   The spill killed thousands of birds and sea mammals and spoiled
hundreds of miles of coastline. It also dealt a severe blow to
Alaska's $2 billion fishing industry, forcing officials to ban,
postpone or restrict fishing in polluted areas.
   Al Kapp, skipper of the salmon seiner Journeyman out of
California, posted a hand-letered sign on the side of his boat as he
ushered the Exxon Valdez away.
   ``Thanks a lot Exxon,'' the sign said.
   Kapp, speaking by radio to the media vessel, said fishing
closures in the sound this season have hurt him. ``It's disrupted my
life; it's disrupted our industry. It's not going to be a normal
season.''
   After the accident, authorities pumped the remaining oil from the
ship into other tankers, refloated it and towed the crippled vessel
to an anchorage off an oil-fouled beach on Naked Island, about 24
miles from Bligh Reef.
   For the past two months divers and specialists have worked to
stabilize the ship and patch it up for its journey south. Eight of
the ship's 13 cargo tanks were breached in the accident and it
suffered major damage to more than half of its bottom, Exxon
officials said.
   ``As I understand it, the Valdez will not be moving under its own
power,'' he said. ``But they (engines) are capable of being fired
up. The vessel will be towed with the on-board power plant available
as necessary.''
   Seven Exxon officers and four salvage experts were aboard for the
trip to San Diego, Tucker said. They will monitor air pressure in
the vessel's cargo tanks, conduct inspections and be ready to help
with the ship's engines.
   Repairing the tanker will require the replacement of 3,000 tons
of steel. That comprises about 10 percent of the vessel's structure,
said officials with National Steel and Shipbuilding Co., which is
repairing the ship it built.
   Exxon Shipping Co. president Frank Iarossi has said the ship will
be rebuilt to original specifications, which include a single hull.
   The Coast Guard on Wednesday approved Exxon's towing proposal and
issued the necessary permits allowing the move.
   The Coast Guard will be aboard to monitor the ship's movement as
it leaves Prince William Sound and again as it enters the approach
to San Diego, said Lt. Alan Carr, a Coast Guard spokesman.
   Exxon and the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. have been criticized
for their slow handling of the spill during the first few days, when
winds were calm, seas were flat and before the oil spread.
   Today, oil with a sludge-like consistency can be found on the
Alaska Peninsula, some 700 miles from the reef.
   The tanker's former captain, Joseph Hazelwood, faces three felony
counts of criminal mischief and misdemeanors including negligent
discharge of pollutants and operating a vessel while drunk. The
42-year-old mariner has pleaded innocent to all charges. He is free
on $50,000 bail.

   Islamic rebels fired 24 rockets into
Kabul in a 45-minute barrage early Friday, killing at least four
people, according to the capital's mayor and witnesses.
   It was the fiercest attack on the capital since June 3, when 12
rebel rockets killed five people.
   The mayor, Gen. Mohammad Hakim, told reporters the rockets fired
Friday probably were aimed at Kabul airport but hit civilian areas,
killing two men and a boy. A woman also was killed, residents
reported.
   Hakim said the mujahedeen (Islamic holy warriors) launched the
rockets from a base in Paghman hills, 12 miles north of Kabul. He
said government forces fired back BM-21 rockets, 122mm missiles with
a range of about nine miles.
   About 80 senior Afghan army officers, including a few generals,
were in Kabul at the time, diplomatic sources said.
   Like the residents, the sources spoke on condition of anonymity.
   They said the officers were summoned from the provinces to an
extraordinary meeting on Thursday of the Supreme Military Council.
They met as reports circulated that the Soviet-backed, Marxist
government was planning a decisive military strategy to fight the
guerrillas, who have been trying to overthrow the government for 11
years.
   The mujahedeen, based mainly in neighboring Pakistan, want to
establish an Islamic republic of Afghanistan.
   Soviet forces fought on the government side for nearly 10 years
but completed a withdrawal from Afghanistan on Feb. 15.
   Foreign ministers Eduard Shevardnadze of the Soviet Union and
Abdol Wakil of Afghanistan held talks in Moscow on Friday and asked
for new talks to settle the conflict in Afghanistan, the official
Soviet news agency Tass said.
   It said Wakil was on a brief stopover en route to The Hague for a
conference on peace and international law..
   The ministers agreed that the position of the Kabul government is
stronger than ever, Tass said.
   ``By successfully repelling desperate opposition attacks at
Jalalabad, Khost, Kandahar and elsewhere, the government ... has
enhanced its prestige both inside the country and in the
international arena, and has demonstrated the stability and
viability of central authorities,'' Tass said.
   Shevardnadze and Wakil said their countries were ready to open
new talks with Pakistan and the United States, both supporters of
the rebels, ``in any place and at any time'' to achieve peace in
Afghanistan, the dispatch said.
   A U.S. diplomat in Moscow, who spoke on a background basis and
demanded not to be identified, said last week that U.S.-Soviet talks
which will include Afghanistan will take place this summer during a
regular meeting on regional issues.

   Documents were sometimes handled in
``haphazard'' and ``chaotic'' way during the congressional
investigation of the Iran-Contra affair but there is no evidence of
a calculated cover-up by the Reagan administration, the Senate
Intelligence Committee said Friday.
   ``We have a situation where there's a lot of fault to go around
on all sides,'' said Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, vice chairman of
the committee and a member of the congressional panel which
investigated the Iran-Contra scandal in 1987.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, also a member of
the investigating committee, asked the intelligence panel to look
into the handling of documents after six important memos were
produced at the trial of Oliver North which the investigators had
either not seen or seen in different versions.
   In a 51-page report, the Intelligence Committee found:
   _There was no evidence to suggest that the documents, relating to
an arrangement under which Honduras would support the Nicaraguan
Contras in exchange for expedited U.S. aid, had been ``deliberately
and systematically withheld by the White House.''
   But David Boren, D-Okla., the committee chairman, said he could
``never rule out completely'' the possibility that someone could
have removed documents from certain files to prevent finding them in
any of several searches.
   _One key memo, a Feb. 19, 1985, message to President Reagan from
then-National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane missed during
document searches, turned up last month in a box of papers at the
Reagan library in California. The memo recommends a letter be sent
to Honduran President Roberto Suazo stating the United States'
``deep conviction'' to support the Contras along with a promise to
defend Honduras against any incursion from Nicaragua.
   The memo strongly suggests the kind of ``quid pro quo''
arrangement with Honduras that has been denied by President Bush. It
was not turned up during two searches of NSC files, but was found in
an informal ``heads of state'' file at the presidential library that
has never been searched by investigators, the report said.
   Boren and Cohen said the heads-of-state file held three 1985
documents detailing an administration plan to slip an extra $110
million in aid to Honduras if that country would support the Contras
in Nicaragua. Reagan initialed his approval for the arrangement on
one of the documents, which were all originals.
   _A document released at the North trial, an Oct. 30, 1985, memo
mentioning the illegal airdrop of two artillery pieces to the
Contras and asking that Reagan be informed of them, also was not
received by congressional investigators. The committee could not
explain why it had not been turned up during searches.
   _Congressional investigators relied on the good faith of the
White House and made no independent check to see whether all
documents they asked for were indeed being found, and never knew
exactly what criteria were being used by those searching for
documents.
   Most decisions on which papers were relevant to the investigation
were being made by FBI agents, and the White House officials
Congress believed were making the decisions had little actual
involvement, the report said.
   Cohen said the process was ``very, very haphazard'' and ``fairly
chaotic.'' But he and Boren said the shortcomings do not taint the
findings of the Iran-Contra committees. ``The committees got the
story,'' their report concluded.
   In a statement Mitchell said the report, ``of necessity, leaves
some questions unanswered, reflecting the great difficulty in
determining the precise handling of particular documents given the
more than 70,000 pages of documents produced by the White House.''
   Boren and Cohen also said they would not be surprised if the
upcoming trials of former national security adviser John Poindexter
and other figures in the affair produce additional new evidence that
the congressional investigators have not seen.
   ``That would be the appropriate place now for these questions to
be answered,'' Boren said.

<HEAD>Company Withdraws From Energy Department Coal Project</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Houston company is withdrawing from the
Energy Department's $2.5 billion program for developing cleaner ways
of burning coal, the department said Friday.
   M.W. Kellogg Co. notified the department June 1 that it wanted to
withdraw because it could not find a place to build a proposed
electric power plant that would attempt to demonstrate a technique
in which coal is changed to a gas. The gas would then be used to
power both a gas turbine and a steam turbine.
   Mary Jo Zacchero, a department spokesman, said the withdrawal was
accepted Friday.
   Kellogg is the first participant to withdraw from the project
since it began in 1986.
   Kellogg, with project partner Bechtel Development Co. of San
Francisco, had received about $900,000 in Energy Department money
since it signed an agreement on Jan. 22, 1988 to proceed with the
project. The eventual cost was to be $244 million.
   Zacchero said Kellogg was obligated to repay the $900,000 if it
eventually developed the technology and put it to commercial use. If
it does not, the money will not be repaid, she said.
   Zacchero said Kellogg wanted to build the plant in Johnstown,
Penn., but was unable to reach agreement with the local utility
company on a contract to purchase power from the proposed plant.
Alternative sites in New York and Virginia also were discarded.
   ``Nobody had anything bad to say about the technology; the
economics just aren't there yet,'' Ms. Zacchero said.
   The department also said it had decided to open negotiations on a
clean-coal proposal from the city of Tallahassee, Fla. The city has
proposed building an advanced clean-burning coal combustor. It would
be the first large-scale utility boiler of this type to burn
eastern, high sulfur bituminous coal.
   The Energy Department now has nine participants in its clean-coal
program and is negotiating terms of participation agreements with 20
others, including Tallahassee.

<HEAD>Gov't Increases Bread Prices; Shortages, Protests Feared</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has increased prices of
ordinary bread slightly and doubled the cost of better-quality
loaves in a move that could cause street protests.
   The new prices were decreed Thursday by a government committee
appointed to ease the burden of soaring living costs on poor
Sudanese.
   A five-ounce loaf of brown bread will cost 1.25 cents, up from
1.17 cents, and premium white bread went up from 2.12 cents a loaf
to 4.25 cents.
   Only well-to-do Sudanese can afford premium bread and they are in
a minority in this nation of 22 million that, according to the World
Bank, is among the poorest in the world.
   In raising prices, the committee failed to set production quotas
for the two kinds of bread. This raised fears that bakeries, intent
on profit, will concentrate on producing premium bread and aggravate
existing shortages.
   The government was forced to abandon announced price increases in
December, when raises in prices of sugar, cigarettes and other
commodities sparked street riots and clashes with police in which
four people were killed.
   The opposition National Islamic Front, which has a substantial
following, protested the new prices.
   Its newspaper Al-Raya published interviews Friday with angry
citizens and quoted one unidentified man as saying: ``We will not
allow the government to increase prices under the cover of
alleviating the burden of living costs. ... These increases will not
happen.''
   Commodity shortages are common in Sudan, saddled with a $13
billion foreign debt and six-year southern civil war that costs $1
million daily.

<HEAD>Private Eye's Work Led to Delay in North Sentencing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A private detective agency hired by Oliver
North's lawyers discovered information about an Iran-Contra trial
juror that caused North's sentencing to be delayed, the defense
revealed Friday.
   Lawyers for the former White House aide said the defense embarked
on a background check of juror Tara Leigh King after North's trial
ended in a guilty verdict on three criminal charges May 4.
   King's failure to acknowledge in a pre-trial questionnaire court
proceedings involving four brothers and sisters has moved back
North's sentencing, which had been scheduled for Friday, to July 5.
One of her brothers had pleaded guilty to armed robbery.
   Granting a request from North, U.S. District Court Judge Gerhard
A. Gesell will hold a hearing Wednesday to focus on King and her
failure to disclose the background information to the court.
   The defense was alerted to allegations about King on May 5 when a
local TV news reporter said King admitted smoking crack cocaine up
until four months before the North trial, according to the defense's
court filing Friday.
   North wrote all the jurors May 11 seeking to question them. Five
days later ``during an interview with a source ... we were told that
a brother ... had drug problems, had been picked up by the police
and had been involved in a prosecution,'' the court filing said.
   North's lawyers hired a detective agency, The Investigative
Group, which on May 30 turned over to North documents on criminal
proceedings involving two of King's brothers and turned over
additional material on another brother and a sister on June 8.
   King responded negatively on a pre-trial questionnaire when asked
whether she or any member of her immediate family ever had been
involved in a court proceeding or in an investigation.
   North's court filing said ``there is absolutely no basis'' for
suggesting that the defense knew about King's background before the
verdict in the North case.
   The prosecution said a defendant ``cannot learn of juror
misconduct during the trial, gamble on a favorable verdict by
remaining silent and then complain in a post-verdict motion.''
   North's lawyers said King has refused to talk to them.
   On Friday, Gesell appointed a local attorney, Vincent Alto, to
represent King in the proceeding.

<HEAD>Theaters, Playwrights Awarded Grants</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Five theaters and playwrights have been awarded
private grants totaling $313,500 to develop and produce new plays in
the 1989-90 season, it was announced Friday.
   The Fund for New American Plays at the Kennedy Center awarded:
   _$90,000 to the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles and $10,000 to
playwright Arthur Kopit for ``Discovery of America,'' scheduled to
open in July 1990.
   _$90,000 to the Cleveland Play House in Cleveland, Ohio, and
$10,000 to playwright Reynolds Price for ``New Music,'' a trilogy
opening next fall.
   _$18,500 to Pacific Jewish Theater at Berkeley, Calif., and
$10,000 to playwright Shem Bitterman for ``Beijing Legends,''
scheduled to open in May 1990.
   _$25,000 to Organic Theater Company of Chicago and $10,000 to
playwright Jeffrey Sweet for ``American Enterprise,'' opening in
April or May 1990.
   _$40,000 to The People's Light and Theater Company at Malvern,
Pa., and $10,000 to playwright Ernie Joselovitz for ``The Devil And
All His Works,'' opening in June 1990.
   The 3-year-old non-profit fund, financed primarily by American
Express Co. and several private foundations, is a joint project of
the Kennedy Center, American Express and the President's Advisory
Committee on the Arts and Humanities, which promotes private
financing of cultural activities.
   ``Our intention is to allow non-profit theater companies to mount
full and sophisticated productions of promising new works,
productions that are worthy of the creative vision of America's best
playwrights,'' said Roger L. Stevens, the fund chairman and retired
chairman of the Kennedy Center.
   The fund already has awarded $507,000 for 14 plays. One of them,
Wendy Wasserstein's ``The Heidi Chronicles,'' won a Pulitzer Prize
this year and a Tony Award for best play. It originally was produced
at the Playwrights Horizons Theater in New York.

   Busty Bernice was on duty as usual Friday, giving
callers a telephonic tour of the Lingerie Corner. The U.S. Supreme
Court said it was OK.
   The young woman's discussion of explicit sex acts on a recorded
line was part of a multibillion-dollar industry _ one that the
nation's highest court ruled has the constitutional right to do
business, under some restrictions.
   ``It's fantastic,'' Gloria Leonard, publisher of High Society
magazine and one of the leading dial-a-porn entrepreneurs, said of
the ruling. ``We feel very triumphant. It really is a victory for
the First Amendment.''
   Ms. Leonard opened her ``adult telephone service'' in 1983, when
the newly broken-up telephone companies first offered dial-up
information services to independent operators. Callers pay the fee,
usually a few dollars, on their phone bill. In exchange, they can
hear Bernice and her counterparts pant.
   ``I know it started in 1983 because that's when the complaints
started coming in,'' said Diane Killory, general counsel of the
Federal Communications Commission. The problem: Curious children
were calling the numbers umpteen times, racking up
thousand-dollar-plus phone bills.
   Parents were not amused. Neither were organizations such as the
Children's Legal Campaign in Phoenix, which has been mounting
lobbying and legal campaigns to have dial-a-porn banned as a
corrupting influence on minors.
   ``There's no way to discriminate between adults and children in
the listening audience,'' said Len Munsil, the campaign's chief
lawyer. ``And it's quite clear that these messages are harmful to
children.''
   In arguing her case, Ms. Leonard cites First Amendment
protections of free speech. And she points to dial-a-porn's enormous
financial success as evidence that it meets community standards of
acceptability.
   ``At its peak, a number of years ago, we were getting half a
million calls a day,'' she said.``The number of willing customers
for these services is testimonial that it's a national standard.''
   While her business is off dramatically _ down to perhaps 5,000
calls a day, Ms. Leonard said _ she maintained that is because of a
proliferation of competitors across the country, not any diminution
of interest in sex talk.
   ``There are dozens if not hundreds of these numbers in every
city,'' she said. ``This stuff has really taken off, on a
mom-and-pop basis.'' However, a source in the Justice Department,
who spoke on condition he not be identified, said many of the
dial-a-porn services appear to have corporate links.
   Whoever runs them, the opportunity for profit is enormous.
Overhead is low: All that's required is a contract with the phone
company for an information service number, a switchboard capable of
handling many calls at once, and women and men willing to be
recorded making suggestive words and noises. Some of the services
provide live telephone contacts.
   While precise figures haven't been compiled, court records say
180 million dial-a-porn calls were placed in New York in 1984.
California has 204 separate dial-a-porn services, making up 25
percent of its information service numbers. Nationwide, the industry
did an estimated $2 billion in business last year.
   Efforts to reduce that business reach to its beginnings. Congress
asked the FCC to look into restricting dial-a-porn in 1983, and last
year the federal lawmakers decided to ban the services outright.
   The Supreme Court ruling upholds the ban on obscene phone
messages, but rejects the ban on messages that are only ``indecent.''
   There can be lesser restrictions on indecent calls, and Ms.
Killory said the FCC likely will revive an earlier plan to require
access codes, scrambled messages or credit card payment for
dial-a-porn. The idea is that children, lacking the codes,
unscramblers or credit cards, could not make the calls.
   Other steps are possible. Since the numbers begin with the same
three-digit exchange, Pacific Bell in California can cut off access
to customers who request it, and 800,000 have done so. And the ban
on obscene calls remains in effect _ though the difference between
obscenity and indecency can be a difficult one to draw.
   ``Many, many of these mesages are obscene,'' said Munsil, the
porn line opponent. ``How do you decide which? We'll find out pretty
soon, when the Justice Department starts enforcing the law.''

   West Germany's parliament on Friday demanded that China stop
executing protesters and urged that development funds be cut off to
Beijing, but Japan's government says it is avoiding sanctions that
would isolate its neighbor.
   Italy put off a decision on development assistance to China to
show its protest of China's crackdown this month against a
pro-democracy movement.
   In Oslo, a firebomb destroyed a car at the Chinese Embassy on
Thursday but caused no injuries, Norwegian police said Friday.
   West Germany's top lawmaking body, the Bundestag, said it
``emphatically demands, along with the federal government, that the
Chinese government neither impose nor carry out any further death
sentences.''
   Chinese authorities this week executed 27 people charged with
taking part in the demonstrations.
   The Bundestag, in the statement forged by all major parties,
urged the West German government to suspend further capital
development assistance to China and urged the World Bank to cease
giving credits.
   The Chinese crackdown began on June 3-4 as government troops
stormed student protesters at Beijing's Tiananmen Square. Official
Chinese media say 200 police and protesters were killed, but Chinese
witnesses and foreign intelligence sources say as many as 3,000 died.
   In East Berlin, church sources said East German security police
on Thursday night temporarily detained 30 people who had tried to
deliver a protest message to the Chinese Embassy.
   East Germany's ruling Communist Party has defended China's
official version of the crackdown on activists.
   Japan is taking cautious steps despite charges at home that it
has not responded strongly enough, the Foreign Ministry in Tokyo
said Friday.
   Prime Minister Sousuke Uno, in a speech to business leaders, said
he worried about isolating China from the international community.
   Japan has halted high-level diplomatic contacts, put off talks on
a new five-year $5.6 billion loan package and publicly expressed
``sorrow and disappointment'' over the executions.
   Japanese opposition politicians, some business leaders and the
media have criticized the cautious stance of the government, which
provides 80 percent of China's foreign aid.
   Foreign Minister Giulio Andreotti said Italy will not make any
decision regarding development aid to China before next week's
Common Market summit in Madrid ``as a sign of serious disagreement
with what is happening with executions and unacceptable repression.''
   Italian development aid to China is estimated to have been about
$1.5 billion over the past eight years. It wasn't immediately known
how much new aid was put on hold by Friday's action.
   In London, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on Friday conferred
with a senior Hong Kong official and renewed promises to be flexible
about allowing the colony's residents to emigrate to Britain.
   But in her meeting with Dame Lydia Dunn, a member of Hong Kong's
Executive Council, Mrs. Thatcher resisted demands to give the 3.25
million Hong Kong Chinese who have a form of British passport the
right to settle in Britain.
   The colony is due to be handed over to China in 1997 under an
agreement which calls for the communist giant to preserve Hong
Kong's capitalist system for 50 years. The crackdown in China has
made many residents uneasy about the change.
   In Hong Kong, a public opinion poll published Friday indicated
only about 6 percent of the residents would move to Britain if
granted the right of residency, while two-thirds would remain in
Hong Kong.
   The poll by Survey Research Hong Kong, which had a margin of
error of 3 percent, also found that 71 percent of the respondents
believed Britain could bolster confidence in the future of Hong Kong
by offering the right of residency.

<HEAD>Police Raid Cocaine Labs in Sustained Anti-drug Campaign</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police destroyed 10 drug laboratories
that were turning out 22,000 pounds of cocaine weekly, the national
police reported Friday.
   The raids this week were the latest in the most sustained
anti-drug campaign ever undertaken by Colombian police.
   It began five months ago after a new national police commander
was named, replacing a general who has been indicted in a
drug-trafficking case.
   A police communique said about 70 policemen using five
helicopters carried out the raids as part of Operation Rainbow. It
said there was a gun battle at one of the labs and two of the lab
guards were killed. It did not mention police casualties.
   The communique said the police destroyed 207,000 gallons of
ether, acetone and other chemicals used to process cocaine.
   A source who accompanied the police told The Associated Press
that some of the ether was in drums identified as latex that had
arrived from the United States through Guatemala. He said evidence
indicated the labs had been operating for about a year.
   He also said traces of cocaine were found on a trail, indicating
the lab workers fled with bags of cocaine as the police helicopters
approached.
   The communique said police seized grenades and automatic weapons
but gave no amount.
   Anti-drug units have seized 24,900 pounds of cocaine this year,
nearly as much as was seized by police in all of 1989, according to
national police statistics.
   Gen. Miguel Antonio Gomez Padilla was appointed national police
commander in February.
   He succeeded Gen. Jose Guillermo Medina Sanchez, who was fired by
President Virgilio Barco. An indictment against Medina Sanchez and a
colonel who worked for him accuse them of cocaine trafficking.
   The 10 labs destroyed this week all were within 10 miles of each
other in the northwestern state of Antioquia, according to the
source who went on the raids.

   President Bush declared Friday that three young
civil rights workers killed 25 years ago by Ku Klux Klansmen were
``heroes,'' but he declined to promise their survivors he would work
to reverse the effects of recent Supreme Court rulings on civil
rights.
   Bush met at the White House with the family members of Michael
Schwerner and Andrew Goodman, both white New Yorkers, and James
Chaney, a black Mississippian, whose lives were the subject of a
fictionalized account in last year's Academy Award-winning movie
``Mississippi Burning.''
   The families were on a commemorative visit to the capital,
including an afternoon rally at the Capitol, to mark the 25th
anniversary of the disappearance of the three young men.
   In a statement released by spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, Bush
lauded the accomplishments of Chaney, Goodman and Schwerner, saying
they ``gave their lives in the struggle to guarantee one of
democracy's most basic civil rights _ the right to vote-for all
Americans.''
   ``We can erect no greater monument to their memory than to ensure
that the arrogance and bigotry that took their lives never again
exists in America,'' Bush added.
   But Rita Schwerner-Bender, who was married to Schwerner, told
reporters she was disappointed Bush did not commit himself when they
asked him to back bipartisan legislation ``to deal with the Supreme
Court cases that have so badly eroded civil rights in this country.''
   The court has drawn criticism from civil rights advocates for
recent rulings that have chipped away at affirmative action and make
it harder to win racial discrimination cases against employers.
   That criticism was renewed Friday at the rally.
   ``This present majority on the Supreme Court is far more
dangerous than Bull Connor with a fire hose,'' Benjamin Hooks,
executive director of the NAACP said. He was referring to the
Birmingham, Ala., sheriff's action against civil rights
demonstrators.
   But Bush was non-committal Friday on the legislation the family
members sought, telling them he is waiting for a Justice Department
to complete a review of the new Supreme Court rulings, said
Fitzwater.
   The visitors also brought up the problems such as housing,
education and medical needs as an extension of the civil rights
struggle. In the meeting characterized by Fitzwater as a classic
liberal vs. conservative discussion, Bush told them the federal
government could not solve everything without participation from
other sectors of society as well.
   ``I think he believes that a group of volunteers will solve the
problem. I don't,'' Mrs. Schwerner-Bender said, referring to Bush's
call for volunteerism.
   She added that she asked the president if he envisioned inviting
a homeless family to live in his Kennebunkport, Maine, home to help
solve the housing problem and he replied negatively.
   Bush also did not express a position on their request for support
of (universal and same-day) voter registration and elimination of
such practices as frequent purging of voter rolls.
   The Bush administration has not taken a postion on any
legislative proposals regarding reforming voter registration, except
to oppose one by Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky.
   That measure would allow voter registration by mail with driver's
license applications, said Deborah Burstion-Wade, deputy director of
public affairs for the Justice Department.
   The president has not voiced any personal sentiments on the
various proposals, the White House said.
   Another participant, Julian Chaney, sister of the slain activist,
said she was not disappointed to get no commitment because ``I did
not expect any commitment.''
   Carolyn Goodman, mother of Andrew Goodman, was less critical of
the president. She said ``he seemed in accord and we hope that he
follows through.'' But she and others said he gave them no specific
commitments.
   The families were on a bus caravan from Philadelphia, Miss.,
where the three were killed, to Washington and New York to
commemorate the June 21, 1964 disappearance of the men. They had
been conducting a black voter registration drive in Neshoba County.
   Their bullet-riddled bodies were found buried in an earthen dam
near Philadelphia, Miss., and the FBI found that the Ku Klux Klan
had killed them.
   Mississippi's attorney general, Mike Moore, is considering
reopening the case in which murder charges against 19 whites
initially were dropped in state court. The suspects, most of whom
are still alive, were tried in federal court. Seven were convicted
of violating civil rights law, another defendant pleaded guilty,
eight were acquitted and the cases against three others ended in
mistrials.
   The most time any spent in prison was six years.

   Heavyweight champion Mike Tyson is portrayed as a
sadistic thug in a new biography where he's quoted as saying his
best punch sent ex-wife Robin Givens bouncing off walls in a
friend's apartment.
   Tyson, who has battered Michael Spinks, Larry Holmes and
Bonecrusher Smith in posting a career 36-0 record, with 32
knockouts, told biographer and one-time friend Jose Torres that he
never hit an opponent as hard as he did Givens.
   ``She really offended me and I went BAM. She flew backwards,
hitting every ----- wall in the apartment,'' Tyson reportedly told
Torres. ``That was the best punch I've ever thrown in my entire
life.''
   The biography, ``Fire and Fear: The Inside Story of Mike Tyson,''
provides an insider's view of the volatile champion. Torres, a
former light-heavyweight champion, was a member of the Tyson camp
until they had a falling out last year.
   Tyson and Givens had a stormy one-year marriage, highlighted by
her nationally televised claim that Tyson often terrorized her.
Tyson in turned charged the couple only married on Feb. 12, 1988,
because Givens lied and said she was pregnant.
   Their divorce was finalized earlier this year.
   Givens' attorney, Raoul Felder, said the ``Head of the Class''
television series star would not comment on the unauthorized
biography.
   ``They had an amicable divorce. Part of the agreement was that
neither would make statements about the other. She will honor
that,'' said Felder. ``Robin is looking forward, not backward.''
   ``Tyson encouraged me to write the book,'' Torres said in an
interview, adding he has 12 hours of taped conversations with the
champion. ``He knew I would not do a story to hurt him. From two or
three excerpts, it appears like a hatchet job. It is not.''
   Excerpts of the book provided by its publisher, Warner Books,
Inc., indicated Givens was not the only woman Tyson abused.
   ``I like to hurt women when I make love to them. I like to hear
them scream with pain, to see them bleed,'' Tyson says in the book,
which will be excerpted in the August issue of Playboy magazine.
   Torres also gives a look at the killer instinct Tyson brings to
the ring for his fights.
   Talking about his 1986 first-round knockout of Jesse Ferguson,
Tyson says, ``I was trying to push his nose bone up into his
brains.''
   The book also portrays Givens as gold-digging and wild-haired
fight promoter Don King as anti-semitic.
   Torres writes of Givens screaming at one of Tyson's
representatives at Merrill Lynch: ``I want my money! Where is my
money?''
   Tyson's managers were Jim Jacobs and Bill Cayton. Jacobs has
died, and Cayton and Tyson are embroiled in a bitter court fight
over the champion's finances.
   King, who has taken over as Tyson's adviser, is quoted as telling
Torres, ``You know very well, Jose, that the Jews want to control
Tyson ... The Jacobses, the Caytons. You know it.''
   King and Tyson were meeting with their attorneys on Friday
afternoon and planned to release a statement later, King's office
said. Earlier, King told the Daily News both he and Tyson were
considering lawsuits against Torres.
   ``Jose Torres is a name-dropping fool. He's dragging Mike into
his own personal cesspool,'' King said. ``He's joining the club of
unauthorized biographers that have smeared people like Ronald and
Nancy Reagan for their own financial gain and ego gratification.''

<HEAD>Juarez Hospital Crisis Cools Down as Donations Come In</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Donations have begun pouring into a
hospital where the 30-year-old air-conditioning system is broken and
the temperature in the stifling pediatric ward has climbed to 100
degrees.
   A New Mexico factory that makes evaporative coolers installed
four units in the ward at Juarez General Hospital, across the border
from El Paso, Texas; an anonymous donor gave 20 portable fans and
two air conditioners; and the El Paso City-County Health District
offered maintenance workers.
   ``I am sincerely overwhelmed and elated to see how these people
have responded,'' Juarez General director Victor Manuel Jurado said
Thursday as workers from Bacchus Industries of Santa Teresa, N.M.,
installed the evaporative coolers.
   Jurado and others said the hospital needs help in airconditioning
the operating rooms and emergency room as well as an overhaul of the
40-year-old sewer system. Sewage has backed up and is running on the
floors of some rooms and dripping through the ceilings.
   ``The response has been incredible,'' Jurado said. ``But we need
to organize ourselves so as not to duplicate efforts and to
distribute the help where it is needed the most.''
   Juarez General is the city's only public hospital.

<HEAD>Iran, Soviet Union Sign Good Relations Pact; Arms May Follow</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran and the Soviet Union ended nearly a decade of
icy relations on Friday by signing a long-term cooperation pact at
the end of a visit by Iran's parliament speaker, with possibly an
arms deal to follow.
   A communique issued at the end of Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani's
four-day visit, including two days of talks with President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev, said the two sides agreed ``to build and develop good
neighborly relations on the principles of equality.''
   Rafsanjani, who is also the acting commander of Iran's armed
forces, is the highest ranking Iranian official to visit Moscow
since the 1979 revolution that crushed the Iranian Communist Party
and sent mobs into the streets shouting ``Death to America, Death to
Russia!''
   He went to Moscow barely three weeks after the death of Iran's
revolutionary patriarch, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini _ while his
country's official 40-day mourning period is still in effect.
   Friday's communique, according to the official Soviet news agency
Tass, said Moscow and Tehran will ``develop economic, scientific,
technological and commercial relations, as well as cooperation in
other fields such as medical services and student and lecturer
exchanges on a long-term basis.''
   Rafsanjani and Gorbachev also signed a declaration pledging to
foster contacts between Soviet religious leaders and those of Iran.
   The declaration promised Soviet cooperation in ``strengthening
the defense capacity'' of its southern neighbor, indicating that the
Kremlin planned to sell weapons to Iran.
   The Soviet Union was Iraq's major arms supplier during the
eight-year Iran-Iraq war, a factor that contributed to the strain in
relations with Iran.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted Rafsanjani as
saying at Tehran airport upon his return home, ``Our negotiations
spanned many fields including cooperation in the economic,
commercial and cultural sectors as well as in the international
arena.''
   Rafsanjani, originally due to return home Thursday, extended his
visit by one day to visit the Azerbaijani capital of Baku, described
by Tehran radio as a ``Moslem city.''
   During a state dinner Wednesday, he invited Gorbachev to visit
Iran. If Gorbachev accepts, he would be the first leader of a major
power to visit Tehran since the revolution.
   Gorbachev and Khomeini exchanged messages last February, and
their foreign ministers then met four times, paving the way for
Rafsanjani's visit.
   Rafsanjani received red-carpet treatment throughout the trip. He
said Thursday after his meetings with Gorbachev, ``The optimism we
had before the meetings has been totally justified.''
   On Friday, Iranian media quoted him as saying, ``The enthusiasm
shown by the Soviet people toward us, especially by the Moslems was
beyond imagination. Such receptions in Moscow, Leningrad and
particularly in Baku were very frank and sincere.''
   Tehran television said Baku's Moslems thronged to receive the
Iranian delegation. It said most were dressed in black, in mourning
for Khomeini's death.
   Tehran radio, Tehran TV and IRNA all were monitored in Cyprus.
   Rafsanjani, an advocate of ending Iran's isolation and building
closer ties abroad, disclosed this month that days before his death
Khomeini advised better relations with the Soviet Union.
   Iranian Chief Justice Musavi Ardebili said Friday that Iran will
not be swayed by U.S. ``threats'' about its developing relationship
with the Soviet Union, Tehran radio reported.
   The United States has expressed concern about warming relations
between Tehran and Moscow, and Soviet willingness to sell arms to
Iran.
   U.S. Secretary of State James Baker III told the House Foreign
Affairs Committee the administration is ``concerned about the
possibility of weapons transfers.''
   Anti-Americanism has been a major plank in Iranian policy since
the Islamic revolution overthrew the shah and brought Khomeini to
power.
   Relations with Moscow improved strongly recently as Iran sought
to rebuild its economy after the devastation of the Iran-Iraq war.
   The war was halted last August by a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire.

   Maintenance crews working ahead of schedule
gave motorists on a 21-mile stretch of the Florida Turnpike a
temporary head start on an increase in the speed limit.
   The state has approved increasing the speed limit from 55 mph to
65 mph on 330 miles of highways, and it becomes effective June 29.
But when crews were notified of the change, they got right on the
job and put up the new 65 mph signs. Unfortunately, it was 10 days
too early.
   The state requires that law enforcement agencies be given 14 days
notice of any change in speed limit. So the 65 mph signs started
coming down Thursday morning.
   The mix-up meant that drivers heading from Jupiter to Boca Raton
between Monday and Thursday traveled 65 mph with impunity, but could
have been pulled over for going 56 mph by noon Thursday.
   The Highway Patrol said it was unlikely drivers would be given
tickets because of the confusion.
   ``Let me put it to you this way,'' said Lt. Jim Howell, district
commander of the Florida Highway Patrol's turnpike substation.
``We're going to use the utmost in discretion.''

   Pines and tall grass obscure a 28-ton
``Welcome to Minnesota'' marker to the point where few people are
being welcomed by it, and officials want it moved.
   The hard part is finding someone who'll undertake the task for a
less than monumental fee.
   The marker in this southeastern Minnesota town is one of 20 such
monuments around the state. Minnesota transportation officials want
to move it one mile from where it was built in 1941.
   Tourism officials forwarded the idea of moving the weighty
monument to the Transportation Department, which decided to seek
bids for the project.
   After one round failed to attract any bidders, the agency
contacted 50 building movers directly and received one bid, which
``was about five times what we expected,'' said Craig Churchward,
project landscape architect for the department.
   The department already has designed the new signs that will hang
from 11 of the 20 monuments. They will read ``Welcome to Minnesota''
on one side, while the other will show pine trees and a canoeist and
the words ``Visit Again.''
   The monuments are unique because each was built with local stone
by federal Works Progress Administration laborers in the 1930s and
early 1940s. The monuments generally mark secondary entrances to the
state, Churchward said.

<TEXT>
   Solidarity's newly elected legislators held
an organizational meeting Friday but postponed a decision on the
issue of Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski's expected bid to be president.
   During the six-hour meeting at Warsaw University the new senators
and deputies chose Bronislaw Geremek to be chairman of the Citizens
Parliamentary Club _ the organization of Solidarity legislators.
   Geremek, a close adviser to Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, was
elected to the Sejm, or Parliament.
   Solidarity candidates scored overwhelming victories in the June 4
election and June 18 runoff against Jaruzelski's communists.
   Senator-elect Andrzej Wielowieyski will be Geremek's deputy, said
Solidarity spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz.
   Solidarity candidates won 99 of the 100 seats in the newly
created Senate and all of the 161 seats open to the opposition in
the 460-member Sejm. The remaining Sejm seats were reserved for the
governing communists and their allies.
   The Senate and Sejm will meet together as the National Assembly
at the end of next week or in early July to elect Poland's first
president in 37 years.
   The communist party is expected to nominate Jaruzelski, its first
secretary. He imposed martial law in December 1981 and used it to
crush Solidarity, which had been chartered in the fall of 1980 as
the first free union movement in the Soviet bloc.
   Solidarity was legalized again under an agreement reached in
April by Solidarity and communist auhtorities that also provided for
the freest elections in Poland in more than four decades.
   Onyszkiewicz told a news conference a decision has not been made
on the presidency.
   ``But the debate indicates that we will not propose our own
candidate, and we will accept the formula that senators and members
of Parliament will vote according to the wishes of the electorate as
expressed during electoral meetings,'' he said.
   He did not elaborate, but apparently meant most Solidarity
legislators would abstain or vote against Jaruzelski's candidacy.
   He noted that the Polish United Workers Party, the official title
of the communist party, has not formally nominated Jaruzelski and
said there is no reason for the opposition to take an immediate
stand.
   The communists are expected to nominate Jaruzelski at a Central
Committee meeting Wednesday.
   Solidarity will have 260 members in the National Assembly and the
communist-led coalition 300, so the communists can elect Jaruzelski.
   He has proposed a ``grand coalition'' with Solidarity, but
Onyszkiewicz said, ``The debate rather indicates that we will not
accept the offer to form a government with the (communist)
coalition.''
   Solidarity leaders previously rejected Jaruzelski's offer but
said legislative cooperation is possible.
   A strong presidency is being restored to Poland for the first
time since 1952. The president will serve for six years, be
responsible for defense and foreign relations and have limited
powers to dissolve Parliament and declare states of emergency.

<HEAD>Gov't Seizes Coffee Growers' Land; Soldiers And Family Defect To

   Three dissident coffee growers said
Friday that authorities seized their farms after the leftist
government accused them of stirring up trouble and running up the
price of one of the country's main crops.
   Also Friday, two soldiers crashed their jeep through a barrier at
the Costa Rican border and asked for political asylum. One of them
brought his family hidden inside the vehicle, Costa Rican officials
said.
   Jaime Wheelock, Nicaragua's minister of agricultural development,
announced Wednesday that the government would be taking over
property belonging to coffee growers Nicolas Bolanos, Jaime Cuadra
and Arnoldo Aleman.
   Jimmy Bolanos, son of Nicolas, told The Associated Press at the
family's land that government officials notified him Friday of the
seizure after surrounding the farm Wednesday. He said that the
confiscation order does not affect the houses where his family lives.
   Arnoldo Aleman told the AP that as of Friday, he still had not
received official notification. ``Police arrived the day before
yesterday and decided that this farm was no longer mine yesterday,''
he said.
   Cuadra, 63, said in a telephone interview from Matagalpa, ``So
far no one has officially notified me of the expropriation, but my
two farms have been taken over militarily.'' He said the land had
belonged to his family for 23 years.
   The Bolanos and Cuadra properties are in Matagalpa province south
of Managua and the Cuadra land is outside Matagalpa, 80 miles north
of the capital.
   The move was viewed as a crackdown on government critics. The
three are members of the Superior Council of Private Enterprise, an
opposition business organization known as COSEP.
   Wheelock, in his declaration, accused the three of fostering
``chaos, disorder, price-gouging, contraband and speculation.'' He
declared the properties ``public utility and social interest'' but
did not mention compensation.
   Coffee growers on Sunday decided to pull out of the National
Coffee Commission. They called the regulatory and
development-oriented panel useless and saying it had ruined the
industry, which produces one of Nicaragua's main export items and is
a principal earner of foreign exchange.
   Ortega accused the growers of trying to sabotage an economic
austerity plan to reduce inflation, which last year topped 10,000
percent.
   As part of the plan, the Sandinista government this week ordered
a 100 percent devaluation of the currency, which sent prices of
consumer goods and services skyrocketing.
   Two brothers, both officers in the Sandinista army, crashed a
military jeep through a chain barrier Friday morning at Penas
Blancas in northwest Costa Rica and asked for political asylum,
Costa Rican officials said.
   Arturo Alfaro, spokesman for Costa Rica's Public Security
Ministry, identified them as Maj. Douglas Zunig Salazar and his
brother, Lt. Walter Zunig Salazar.
   There was no immediate comment by the Nicaraguan government.
   Col. Sergio Sergio Fernandez, Costa Rica's chief of security said
the the border has a metal chain to prevent unauthorized vehicles
from crossing, ``but the two escaping soldiers broke it while
crossing the border at full speed in a Soviet-made vehicle.''
   Fernandez said Douglas Zunig Salazar was accompanied by his wife
and two daughters, who were hidden in the vehicle apparently to
escape detection by Sandinista soldiers. He did not identify the
family members by name.
   Fernandez did not elaborate on the motives of the defecting
officers and said the asylum request will be investigated.
Authorities say Sandinista soldiers occasionally cross the border
into Costa Rica to defect.

<TEXT>
   Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Jonas
Malheiro Savimbi, whose handshake could mark the beginning of peace
in Angola's 14-year civil war, are both strong leaders. One is known
for his flamboyant rhetoric. The other is low-keyed and pragmatic.
   Rebel leader Savimbi's colorful style is matched by a
checkerboard of alliances with South Africa, the United States and
China.
   He looks equally at home in well-pressed battle fatigues at
UNITA's bush headquarters in Jamba, southern Angola, or in a slick
Mao suit in Washington.
   In public, the Soviet-trained dos Santos, Angola's president, is
cast in the role of reluctant statesman. He is sober, reserved and
insistent that Angola's future lies in one-party rule by the Popular
Movement for the Liberation of Angola, known as MPLA.
   Savimbi was born in 1934 in Munhango, central Angola, son of a
Benguela railroad employee who was also a part-time Protestant
preacher.
   He stepped into the limelight as the 20-year-old general
secretary of the Angolan People's Union _ the southern African
nation's first liberation movement that carried out random attacks
against Portuguese colonialists and Angolan civilians.
   A member of the MPLA in 1962, Savimbi was nominated foreign
minister of Angola's government-in-exile.
   He resigned and studied for two years at Lausanne University,
Switzerland, before founding UNITA, the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola, in 1966 and receiving military training in
China.
   In September 1975, UNITA split with Angola's three-party
transitional government. On Nov. 11, 1975, Savimbi declared the
Democratic Angolan Republic in his Huambo stronghold.
   The same day, about 420 miles northwest in the capital Luanda,
MPLA leader Agostinho Neto declared independence for the People's
Republic of Angola.
   UNITA, backed by South Africa and the United States, began a
guerrilla war to force the Cuban-aided MPLA to share power.
   Neto died in Moscow in 1979, and dos Santos, then 37 years old
and vice president and minister of planning, was elected as his
replacement, a moderate between rival radical and conservative MPLA
factions.
   Dos Santos, a Moscow-trained mining engineer and
telecommunications specialist, surprised many observers in Luanda by
clamping down quickly on MPLA infighting after his election.
   Reports say he has survived several coup attempts, and he has
concentrated more power directly under the presidency.
   Angolans are weary of a war that began almost 30 years ago
against Portuguese rule. And dos Santos has donned the cloak of
pragmatism in an effort to revitalize the war-hit economy of what is
potentially one of Africa's richest nations, .
   He looks set to shed Marxist economic policies in exchange for
membership in the International Monetary Fund and U.S. diplomatic
recognition.
   Dos Santos now is a graying 47 and is usually somber in
appearance, but he still plays handball, basketball and soccer.
   Savimbi draws support mainly from the southern- and central-based
Ovimbundu and Ovambo ethnic groupings. The MPLA has relied on
cross-ethnic support, mainly from the central Atlantic coast, in
Luanda and other towns and from Angolans of mixed Portuguese-African
ancestry.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch on Friday unveiled an $8
billion package of financial incentives to small employers and
increased government spending in a bid to provide health-care
coverage for most of the estimated 37 million Americans who have
none.
   The Utah Republican, with the support of several business groups,
offered his measure as an alternative to the $23 billion universal
health care plan advocated by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.
   ``His bill simply treats the symptoms, not the real disease _
rising health care costs,'' Hatch said of the Kennedy plan, which
Hatch predicted could ultimately cost $100 billion or more.
   Hatch said he believed cost savings would more than pay for his
plan but he said he would seek new revenue to pay for the government
part of it if necessary.
   Kennedy's plan would require most employers to provide health
insurance and have the government step in to cover the unemployed.
Hatch's would seek to control health care costs and offer tax and
other financial incentives designed to make insurance more
affordable to small business. It also calls for expansion of
Medicaid coverage to more than 12 million uninsured poor.
   Kennedy, in a statement, said Hatch's proposal included ``many
worthwhile ideas'' but would cost taxpayers more than his plan. ``In
my view, businesses that refuse to insure their workers are part of
the problem, and should be required to share in the solution.
Senator Hatch would give them a free ride and taxpayers would have
to pay too much.''
   Hatch's proposal was endorsed by the Chamber of Commerce, the
National Association of Manufacturers and other business and
insurance groups.
   ``Our health care system needs to be pushed and shoved so that it
works better in providing health care for all Americans,'' Hatch
said. ``Affordable health care gives us greater access to health
care.''
   The introduction of the Hatch proposal came amid growing
complaints about health-care costs from business and other interests
which have long opposed efforts by Kennedy and others to mandate
health benefits.
   Although they still oppose Kennedy's approach, a number of major
corporations and business and health-care industry leaders this year
have asked Congress for help in controlling costs.
   Major elements of the Hatch proposal include:
   _Eliminating state mandates on what coverage must be provided in
health insurance, which Hatch said would allow small employers to
develop lower cost plans.
   _Expanding, at a $1 billion cost to the government, from 25
percent to 100 percent the tax deduction for health insurance
premiums for the self-employed. The provision also would allow small
businesses with no federal tax liability to recoup one-third of the
cost of providing health care to their employees.
   _Providing $10 million in grants to help states develop insurance
programs to provide coverage to those who cannot obtain insurance.
   _Amending antitrust laws to allow small businesses to pool health
insurance for their workers.
   _Spending $50 million to improve coordination of, and boost
funding for, state and federal programs providing prenatal care to
low-income women.
   _Spending $100 million in grants to states for programs to
prevent accidents, improve emergency medical services systems and
pay health care providers for uncompensated services they provide to
accident victims.
   _Granting the Department of Health and Human Services authority
to establish treatment guidelines designed to reduce malpractice
claims by providing a defense for such litigation.

   Economic Planning Secretary Solita
Monsod, one of the original members of President Corazon Aquino's
Cabinet, resigned citing differences over policy, it was announced
Friday.
   Mrs. Aquino accepted the resignation Friday ``with deep regret,''
said spokesman Adolfo Azcuna. Mrs. Monsod said she submitted her
resignation June 16 because she no longer ``enjoyed the full
confidence'' of the president.
   Mrs. Aquino named Mrs. Monsod's deputy, Filologo Pante, as acting
secretary and as acting director of the National Economic
Development Authority, a post she held concurrently.
   Mrs. Monsod, a U.S.-trained economics professor, was an outspoken
advocate of cutting back payments on the $28 billion foreign debt,
which Mrs. Aquino has pledged to repay.
   Mrs. Monsod, 48, also advocated reform in the country's
market-oriented economy.
   ``President Aquino cited the principal reason given by Secretary
Monsod for resigning as `honest but irreconcilable differences of
opinion on economic policy, negotiating strategy and the definition
of national interest,''' Azcuna said.
   The resignation, rumored for months, was announced after Mrs.
Monsod met Mrs. Aquino at the presidential palace. Afterward, Mrs.
Monsod refused to talk about the resignation or elaborate about her
differences.
   Critics of the decision to repay the foreign debt in full say
much of the arrears during the administration of President Ferdinand
Marcos came from loans siphoned off by Marcos and his associates.
   Mrs. Aquino took power after Marcos was ousted in February 1986
in a popular uprising sparked by an allegedly fraud-ridden
presidential election between the two.
   Mrs. Monsod graduated from the University of the Philippines and
received a master's degree in economics from the University of
Pennsylvania in 1962.

   An American relief worker kidnapped in the Gaza
Strip was released Friday along with a letter from his captors
urging President Bush to meet with Yasser Arafat and appealing for
greater understanding of the Palestinian problem.
   Chris George, co-director of the U.S.-based Save the Children
Federation, said he was treated well during his 30 hours in
captivity. George, 35, of Montclair, N.J., walked into the Marne
House hotel in Gaza City about 6 p.m. (11 a.m. EDT).
   ``They were nice to me,'' he said. ``I practiced my Arabic during
this period, I ate my food, fish.''
   Later, speaking to journalists outside his home in the West Bank
town of Ramallah, he said: ``When I asked my kidnappers, `Why me?'
they said, `Because you are a well-known and important American.'''
   He said he knew one of his kidnappers and identified him as
Mohammed Abu Nasr, who signed the letter George was asked to relay
to Bush.
   Nasr is believed to be a Palestinian released from an Israeli
jail in a 1985 prisoner swap. Palestinians in Gaza say he is not
known to be affiliated with any political faction.
   The affiliation of the abductors remained unknown. The Israeli
army blamed ``terrorists linked to the PLO.'' The Palestine
Liberation Organization denied involvement.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said a note in
Arabic attributed the incident to the Palestinian Popular Army,
about which the United States has no information.
   In the 13-page letter to Bush, the captors said they kidnapped
George to draw world attention, particularly American, to
Palestinians' plight.
   ``I appeal to you in my name and the name of my comrades and all
my comrades in jail and all Palestinians to do your best to deal
seriously and effectively with the Palestinian cause.
   ``Why don't you do your duty and receive the head of our state,
Mr. Yasser Arafat, in your office?'' the letter said.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Len Lefko said he was not aware of any
conditions for George's release.
   George was seized about 11:30 a.m. Thursday when he was lured
from his Gaza City office. He was freed at a U.N. hostel on Gaza
City beach, then taken to the Marne House by U.S. Embassy officials.
   Ann Nixon, co-director of Save the Children in the occupied
territories, said George immediately called his wife, Elizabeth
Webb. The couple have two daughters.
   ``He said he was very well treated and thought his family
probably suffered more than he did,'' Ms. Nixon said.
   George was the first foreigner kidnapped since Israel captured
the Gaza Strip and West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war.
   The territories have been torn by a Palestinian revolt against
Israeli rule for the past 18 months, and more than 520 Palestinians
have been killed.
   During the uprising, the PLO-backed underground has maintained a
policy exempting foreigners from attacks.
   In Tunis, PLO spokesman Ahmed Abdul-Rahman denounced the
abduction. He said earlier that the PLO was ``making the greatest
effort'' to secure George's release.
   Arab reports said at least two handwritten communiques from
George were passed to the Red Cross during his captivity, outlining
demands for the release of Palestinian prisoners.
   The reports said George wrote that he was taken by five men armed
with a machine gun and grenades. Israeli officials said he may have
known the man who lured him from his office.
   A Palestinian journalist shown one of George's letters said it
was written in English and addressed to U.S. Ambassador William
Brown and Bush.
   In the letter, George said his captors were demanding Israel
release seven senior Palestinian activists, including Sheikh Ahmed
Yassin, spiritual leader of the Hamas fundamentalist movement, and
three members of PLO factions.
   George is fluent in Arabic and has worked in the Middle East many
years. He was with the Peace Corps in Oman more than a decade ago
and worked in the Palestinian refugee camp of Ein Hilweh in Lebanon
with Save the Children before moving to Israel in January 1986.
   He left Lebanon after kidnappings by Moslem radicals made it
dangerous for Westerners.
   The kidnapping was condemned by several Palestinian organizations
in Israel, including leaders of six Palestinian workers' and women's
groups.
   ``The ugly crime is not linked to the Palestinian people,'' their
statement said. ``It is aimed at hurting our people, our intefadeh
(uprising) and our leadership, the PLO.''

   A grenade hurled into a crowded
downtown market Friday killed two people and wounded 56, police and
doctors reported.
   No group asserted responsibility for the attack, which police
said could have had only one objective: killing and maiming vendors
and shoppers, mostly women and children.
   One person was killed instantly and the other died at Rosales
Hospital, according to Dr. Manuel Angulo, chief of emergency
services at the hospital.
   He said five of the wounded were in critical condition.
   ``I heard a tremendous blast and came running,'' said onion
seller Rit Estela Alas, 32. ``People were lying on the ground,
clutching themselves and crying. One young boy's face was
destroyed.''
   Her stand is about 30 feet from where the grenade exploded at a
shack-like structure that sold cheap lunches and snacks of
cheese-filled tortillas.
   Half-eaten tortillas and pieces of pineapple and mango were
scattered among puddles of blood.
   Ms. Alas and market security guard Salvador Hernandez said they
helped rush about 20 people to the hospital.
   ``We stopped four or five pickups and loaded in the most
seriously wounded,'' said Hernandez, his jeans and T-shirt stained
with blood.
   Two police experts said the explosive device apparently was a
grenade thrown by hand and not fired by a launcher.
   The attack came after armed forces and leftist rebels reported a
surge in combat that left dozens of fighters killed or wounded.
   The Armed Forces Press Committee said government troops killed 23
insurgents and wounded 13 others in fighting Thursday and early
Friday, and that seven soldiers were killed and four wounded.
   Rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front announced
a regional offensive in northern Chalatenango province on the
clandestine radio. They said they killed or wounded 38 soldiers in
13 clashes Thursday and early Friday.
   The heaviest fighting appeared to be in and around La Palma, 50
miles north of San Salvador, where the rebels claimed to have killed
13 soldiers and the government claimed to have killed 14 insurgents.
Both sides routinely exaggerate enemy casualties and it usually is
impossible to confirm their figures.
   About 70,000 people, mostly civilians, have been slain in the
9-year civil war. President Alfredo Cristiani, who took office June
1, plans legislation giving police, armed forces and courts more
power against suspected subversives. Opposition political and union
organizations and human rights groups say the proposed laws are
Draconian.
   The new administration on Friday tied its proposed legislation to
Wednesday's shooting of American nun Mary MacKey, 72.
   ``This deed violates human rights and once again demonstrates
that the terrorist delinquency has reached a point that obliges the
government to adopt urgent laws to protect people's lives and
property,'' said a government communique.
   But it said, ``Preliminary investigations indicate common
criminals were responsible'' for the shooting at a vehicle in which
three nuns were traveling. The two other women were not injured.
   Sister MacKey was conscious Friday when she left on an ambulance
plane for Houston, Texas, according to the Rev. Ken Myers.
   Myers, her priest and director of the orphanage where she worked,
said the nun will lose the sight in her left eye.

<HEAD>One-Year Countdown Starts to Approval of Constitutional Accord</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: SUBS 9th graf, `Quebec was...' to CORRECT year to 1987.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Canada on Friday began the one-year countdown to
the deadline for approval of a constitutional agreement that would
recognize Quebec as a ``distinct society.''
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney calls the Meech Lake accord
critical to national unity, but the proposal is off to a rocky start.
   Two of Canada's 10 provinces have yet to ratify the accord and
there have been threats to reconsider it elsewhere.
   ``One year from today, the Meech Lake constitutional accord
either lives or dies and some of the major players in the drama are
already betraying hints of the exasperation they feel,'' the Toronto
newspaper The Globe and Mail said Friday.
   Canada gained independence in 1867, but British jurisdiction over
the constitution did not formally end until April 17, 1982, when
Queen Elizabeth II proclaimed the new Constitution Act.
   But Quebec, where 80 percent of the population speaks French,
refused to join the nine other provinces in signing the national
constitution.
   Officials feared that Quebec's legal and social traditions,
established by the region's French founders and unique among the
provinces, would not be protected from tampering by the federal
government.
   Seven years later, in April 1987, Mulroney and the 10 provincial
premiers reached an agreement in principle at Meech Lake, Quebec,
that would recognize those distinctions and bring the province into
the constitutional fold.
   Quebec was the first province to ratify the accord, on June 22,
1987. At that time a three-year deadline for full ratification
began. The federal Parliament approved the accord last year, but
ratification is still needed by two provinces, New Brunswick and
Manitoba.
   A new provincial government in Newfoundland has been threatening
to rescind approval by a previous government.
   The Constitution applies to Quebec even though it has not signed
the document, but the refusal makes it more difficult to consider
national policy changes on issues such as how the Senate operates.
   Although the Meech Lake accord has become a major issue in
Canadian political circles and is a frequent topic for national news
media, the public remains largely indifferent.
   A Gallup poll published Thursday in the Toronto Star found that
30 percent of Canadians believe the Meech Lake accord is good for
the country, 31 percent believe it isn't good and 40 percent don't
know.
   In January, 31 percent said it was good, 18 percent said it
wasn't and 52 percent didn't know.
   Opponents charge that recognizing a distinct society within
Canada could weaken the national Charter of Rights, and they say the
provinces would be given too much power. English-speaking provinces,
especially those in Western Canada, traditionally have been wary of
Quebec.
   ``The people here generally are questioning the distinct society
provision,'' Premier William Vander Zalm of British Columbia told
the Canadian Press news agency Thursday in an indication his support
for the accord could be wavering as well. ``They're worried about
it, becoming afraid.''

<HEAD>Cardinal Timothy Manning Dead of Cancer at 79</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE V. BIGELOW</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cardinal Timothy Manning, who strived to unify
a divided archdiocese by reaching out to other faiths and minorities
during his 15 years as Roman Catholic Archbishop of Los Angeles,
died of cancer Friday. He was 79.
   Manning died at the Norris Cancer Hospital of the University of
Southern California, said A.J. Antczak, managing editor of The
Tidings, the archdiocese newspaper.
   Ordained a priest in 1934, he retired in 1985 as archbishop.
Manning observed the 55th anniversary of his ordination as priest
last week.
   Former President Ronald Reagan said in a statement the archbishop
``was a man of great strength, courage and compassion.''
   ``He enriched the life of thousands who are better because of his
good work,'' Reagan said.
   Mayor Tom Bradley ordered flags at city buildings flown at
half-staff in honor of Manning.
   ``Cardinal Manning eased the turmoil and transition from pre- to
post-Vatican Council times for Catholics in the Los Angeles area,''
Bradley said. ``He helped them through a most difficult period, and
for that he will be remembered.''
   Manning took over the archbishop's chair in 1970 from Cardinal
James Francis McIntyre, whose final years were filled with rancor as
minority Catholics protested weekly in front of St. Basil's Catholic
Church, saying they were being alienated from their own church.
Manning worked quickly to soothe angered feelings and reconcile the
church with disenfranchised groups.
   ``The most pressing problem, the first responsibility I could
see, was toward the priest of the diocese,'' he said in an interview
18 months after he succeeded McIntyre. ``The whole well-being of the
community depends on the priests, on their unity, and on their
holiness. My first reaction was to make it known that I was here to
listen.''
   The new archbishop established ministries for blacks and
Hispanics and began a Priests' Senate to give the clergy greater say
in the business of the archdiocese. An Inter-Parochial Council
extended the participation to the parish level.
   In 1975, he established vicars for the Spanish speaking and black
communities and for the Orange and Santa Barbara-Ventura counties.
   Manning also visited local Protestant and Jewish congregations.
   During the Vietnam war, he ensured young Catholic men knew about
their right to declare themselves conscientious objectors.
   He spoke out against the nuclear arms race, calling it in 1980 a
``dance of death,'' and in 1981 declared ``The cry of the poor for
bread has been answered by warheads.''
   He petitioned then-Secretary of State George Shultz in 1983 to
halt the deportation of Salvadoran refugees.
   His social liberalism was matched by a theological conservatism.
He declared abortion was murder and said shortly after he was made
archbishop that any Catholic who cooperates in an abortion was
excommunicated from the church.
   ``Even the mother herself is not immune from this severe
censure,'' he said. He also remained firm on several other points of
church law, such as birth control, that some American Catholics have
generally disregarded.
   Manning, a native of Ballingeary, County Cork, Ireland, answered
a call for priests in America by coming in 1928 to St. Patrick's
Seminary in Menlo Park, Calif.
   After ordination in 1934, he went to Rome for postgraduate
studies at the Gregorian Institute and received the degree of Doctor
of Canon Law in 1938. He returned to Los Angeles and was appointed
secretary to Archbishop John J. Cantwell.
   He was named an auxiliary bishop in 1946 and consecrated a full
bishop the same year. Two years later he was made chancellor of the
Los Angeles Archdiocese; in 1955 he was made vicar general and in
1967 was appointed bishop of Fresno.
   In 1973, Pope Paul VI elevated Manning to the College of
Cardinals. Manning served six popes.
   A Mass for Christian Burial will be said Wednesday morning, and a
rosary will be said that night.
   More than 100 bishops nationwide and in Europe were expected to
gather Thursday morning for another Mass of Christian Burial and
burial will follow.

<HEAD>Storms Soak Texas and Atlantic Coast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms swept through southeast Texas on Friday, swelling
rivers and creeks, and other storms drenched the Atlantic Coast,
dumping 3 inches of rain on New Jersey and leaving parts of Maryland
and Delaware without electricity.
   Flash flood watches were posted overnight for southeast Texas,
which already has received heavy rains.
   Showers and thunderstorms also developed along the Atlantic Coast
through Friday afternoon and were widely scattered from eastern
Tennessee to New England.
   In southwestern New Jersey, many roads across Cumberland County
were flooded. In Bridgeton, 3 inches of rain fell in just little
more than an hour.
   In northwest Delaware, thunderstorms soaked west central New
Castle County with 2{ inches of rain in one hour; Glasgow was hit
with 1} inches; and Newark received almost 1{ inches.
   More than 30,000 customers lost power in the Dover-Wilmington,
Del., area during the midday storm, utility officials said. More
than 5,000 were left without electricity on Maryland's Eastern Shore.
   Power was restored to about 95 percent of the customers in both
cities and in outlying areas.
   Also in Delaware, lightning struck 15 homes or buildings in
Wilmington, New Castle County, fire officials said. County officials
said they answered more than two dozen fire reports.
   Showers and a few thunderstorms also rumbled through Kansas and
northwestern Oklahoma. Conditions were cloudy from the Rockies to
the Atlantic Coast, and sunny skies prevailed west of the Rockies.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 48
degrees at Evanston, Wyo., to 101 degrees at Gila Bend and Phoenix,
Ariz.
   Saturday's forecast called for scattered showers and
thunderstorms from the middle Atlantic Coast through the upper
Mississippi Valley to the northern Plateau region; showers and
thunderstorms in the northern Rockies and the northern high Plains
and in Florida to eastern Texas; scattered showers and thunderstorms
from the southern Atlantic Coast to eastern Oklahoma and central
Texas; and fair to partly sunny across the rest of the nation.
   Forecasters predicted high temperatures in the low 90s across
Florida and Georgia; above 90 degrees from southwest Texas to
southern and central California, above 100 degrees in southern
Arizona and southern California; in the 70s across New England;
below 80 degrees along the California coast, and from the upper
Mississippi Valley to the northern half of the Plateau region; and
in the 60s in the northern Rockies and the northern high Plains.

   Student activists helping dissidents escape from
China said Tuesday they had smuggled the leader of an outlawed
organization into this British colony.
   They said they expected other Chinese who were active in the
pro-democracy movement in communist China would be arriving in Hong
Kong.
   The students, speaking with the condition they not be identified,
said Yan Jiaqi and his wife, Gao Gao, came to Hong Kong Tuesday from
China and the couple planned to go to the United States by way of
Western Europe.
   They said Yan and his wife ``were in a safe place'' but would not
say where.
   One student said the couple did not come here by train or plane
but refused to give any details. ``There are many ways to leave
China,'' he said.
   Yan was a leader of the Beijing Independent Intellectuals
Association and faced certain arrest and possible death in China.
The organization was formed in May to support the campaign for more
democracy. It and other independent organizations were banned with
the imposition of martial law in Beijing on May 20.
   Yan and thousands of other dissidents went into hiding when
communist authorities sent troops into Beijing on June 3 to crush
the reform campaign and hundreds of people were killed.
   More than 1,600 have been arrested since the crackdown began and
27 people were executed this week.
   China has reinforced its border and customs units to catch
dissidents trying to flee and the government news media has reported
the arrests of people at airports and railroad stations.
   Hong Kong students who belong to the New York-based Committee for
the Advancement of Democracy in China helped Yan and his wife escape.
   Su Shaozhi, another prominent dissident, arrived in the United
States on Thursday and went to live with his brother in Chicago. He
refused to tell reporters how he got out of China.
   Su headed the Research Institute of Marxist Thought until 1987
when he was removed during the campaign against ``bourgeois
liberalization.'' He was not active in the pro-democracy movement
but signed an open letter this year calling for the release of
political prisoners.
   Yan participated in the protests.
   He drafted an essay criticizing senior leader Deng Xiaoping and
on the day before the military assaults began he was named president
of the symbolic Democracy University set up by students who occupied
Tiananmen Square.

<TEXT>
   A joint declaration that could lead to closer
cooperation between Roman Catholics and Anglicans is expected when
Pope John Paul II and Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie meet in
Rome this fall, a Church of England official said Friday.
   The Rev. Christopher Hill said they will discuss the mission and
potential unity of their churches and not allow the vexed question
of women priests and bishops _ strongly opposed by the Vatican _ to
dominate their talks.
   Hill, Runcie's secretary for ecumenical affairs, briefed
journalists at Runcie's Lambeth Palace residence on the archbishop's
four-day visit to Rome, Sept. 29-Oct. 2.
   The pope leads about 650 million Catholics and the archbishop,
spiritual head of the state Church of England, leads the world's 70
million Anglicans.
   Hill said Runcie's party will include the archbishop of Nigeria,
Joseph Adetiloye.
   Adetiloye's presence ``makes the point visible that it is the
worldwide Anglican Communion'' at the talks, Hill added.
   Runcie's visit will be only the fourth to the Vatican by an
archbishop of Canterbury since the 16th-century Reformation, but
Runcie has had four meetings elsewhere with John Paul.
   When the visit was announced in March, Runcie's office said
church unity would top the agenda. It stressed that the visit was
planned before the election and consecration in February of the Rt.
Rev. Barbara Harris as the first Anglican woman bishop by the U.S.
Episcopalians' Boston diocese.
   Opponents of women priests and bishops said the consecration made
Catholic-Anglican unity impossible and threatened to split the
world's 27 self-governing Anglican churches.
   There are now women priests in six Anglican churches _ the U.S.
Episcopal Church, Canada, New Zealand, Uganda, Kenya and Brazil. The
other 21 churches, including the Church of England, still refuse to
admit women to the priesthood although some, including England, are
moving toward doing so.
   The pope wrote Runcie in December that ordaining women priests
and recognizing the right to proceed to women bishops, appeared to
preempt nearly 30 years of Catholic-Anglican dialogue on unity and
``effectively block the path'' to mutual recognition of each other's
clergy.
   Hill said the joint declaration from the Rome meeting is likely
to encourage closer coperation between Catholics and Anglicans in
spreading the Christian gospel, particularly in Africa where the two
churches are both seeing their greatest growth.
   Previous visits to the Vatican of archbishops of Canterbury were
by Geoffrey Fisher in 1960, meeting Pope John XXIII; Michael Ramsey,
to Pope Paul VI in 1966, and by Donald Coggan, also with Paul VI, in
1977.
   John Paul and Runcie are expected to worship together in the
church of St. Gregory the Great, which stands on the site of a
monastery where Pope Gregory I in 596 gave his blessing to Augustine
and 40 other monks setting out to convert England to Christianity.
   During the Reformation, King Henry VIII broke with Rome in 1534
to set up the English church when Pope Clement VII refused him a
divorce from Catherine of Aragon.

<HEAD>US to Change Sugar Import System</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Uneasy members of Congress from sugar-producing
states said Friday they were waiting for proposals from the Bush
administration to change U.S. sugar import quotas, now labeled an
official violation of international trade agreements in a ruling
accepted by the administration.
   Sen. Spark Matsunaga, D-Hawaii, noted that U.S. Trade
Representative Carla A. Hills had maintained there should be no
``unilateral disarmament'' by the United States on sugar and added,
``I aim to hold her to this position.''
   In an earlier statement Thursday, Mrs. Hills said:
   ``We have an obligation under the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade to administer the program consistent with international
trade rules and we are confident we can do so. We have ample time to
consider our options and will be consulting closely with the
industry and the Congress.''
   The quotas, which vary from time to time, reduced U.S. imports of
sugar from $1.1 billion worth in 1982 to $400 million last year.
   The statements followed a meeting in Geneva on Thursday where the
U.S. representative joined delegates from 95 other governments in
the GATT Council to accept the report of an international panel that
ruled against the United States. The panel consisted of Poland,
Uruguay and Hong Kong. Under rules of the agreement, any single
member can block acceptance of a report.
   The United States has formally accused Japan, India and Brazil of
unfair trading practices, singling them out for early negotiations
to reduce barriers, and could have been embarrassed had it resisted
the panel report.
   Rep. Arlan Stangeland, R-Minn., who represents the country's
biggest sugar beet district, said Hills had not yet told members of
Congress what the U.S. options are.
   ``I think we should fight a little harder and defend the law,''
he said in an interview.
   He said Australia, which brought the original complaint before
the GATT Council, protects its sugar growers with a high tariff that
the United States cannot duplicate. The 12 governments of the
European Community subsidize their exports and the United States
could do that, he added.
   Thomas Hammer, president of the Sweetener Users Association, said
the U.S. government should increase its imports and lower its price
for sugar, which is twice the world price.
   ``The bitter irony is that American consumers are forced to pay
$3 billion a year to finance a program that violates international
trade laws,'' he said in a statement.
   The U.S. country-by-country quotas are set so that the government
does not have to lay out any money to buy up sugar surpluses from

<HEAD>Los Alamos Researchers Find Tritium In Duplication Of Utah Fusion
Experiment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Los Alamos National Laboratory researchers
have discovered tritium, a byproduct of nuclear fusion, in
duplicating the University of Utah's purported breakthrough in
producing cold fusion.
   Edmund K. Storms, a staff member of the Department of Energy's
New Mexico lab, said he and another researcher, Carol Talcott, found
tritium in ``significant amounts,'' 4,000 counts per milliliter, in
two cells, the Deseret News reported Friday.
   On March 23, Utah chemist B. Stanley Pons and a British
colleague, Martin Fleischmann, announced they had sustained a
nuclear fusion reaction immersing rods of paladium inside platinum
coils in deuterium-rich heavy water.
   The two researchers said the experiment produced up to 100 times
the energy needed to produce the reaction.
   ``Tritium can only be produced through a fusion reaction,'' said
Storms, who began his experiments shortly after Pons and Fleischmann
made their announcement three months ago.
   ``We are trying now to understand really what environment must
exist in the electrodes to allow this to happen,'' Storms said.
   About a dozen labs around the world have reported finding tritium
in their fusion experiments, but Los Alamos is the first government
laboratory to do so.
   The news was met with jubilation by another fusion researcher.
   ``This result is of fantastic importance because tritium
absolutely proves fusion. If you get tritium, there is fusion
occurring,'' said John O. Bockris, a professor of chemistry at Texas
A&amp;M University.
   Three labs at Texas A&amp;M have duplicated major aspects of the
Pons-Fleischmann experiments, including small amounts of excess
heat. In one lab, researchers have seen the neutrons and large
amounts of tritium.
   ``This (Los Alamos) result, which confirms ours precisely, is of
immense, world-influencing importance,'' Bockris said. ``It's the
greatest news we have had since the 23rd of March.''
   Bockris is convinced that the Los Alamos' confirmation will
soothe the controversy that has raged in scientific circles since
the Pons-Fleischmann announcement. The experiment has been generally
derided by physicists, who contended Utah may have achieved an
unknown chemical reaction, but not fusion.
   A spokesman at Los Alamos also was cautious.
   ``The marvelous thing about science is the checks and balances
that now will enter the picture. This work must not only be
reproduced and confirmed, but also peer reviewed and published,''
said Jeff Schwartz.
   ``And quite frankly, we are unable to say if the research will
indeed withstand the scrutiny of the historic, traditional process.
But as an institution, our credibility demands that the process go
forth. We all agree on that,'' he added.
   Storms acknowledges that while he is ``optimistic,'' about his
findings, he hasn't solved the mysteries behind cold nuclear fusion.
   ``We are presently trying to reproduce that phenomenon, but so
far have been unsuccessful,'' Storms said. ``It (the tritium) gives
us some optimism, but until we are able to reproduce it we are
really not much further ahead.''
   Los Alamos is currently collaborating with Texas A&amp;M and Brigham
Young University.

   A federal appeals court Friday overturned the
racketeering convictions of Gov. Buddy Roemer's father and reputed
mobster Carlos Marcello.
   Charles E. Roemer II, commissioner of administration under former
Gov. Edwin Edwards, and Marcello were convicted in 1981 of
conspiracy to violate federal racketeering laws in a sting operation
aimed at bribing state officials.
   Roemer served 15 months of a three-year prison term. Marcello,
given a seven-year sentence and facing a 10-year term for trying to
bribe a federal judge in Los Angeles, remains in prison. Three
others were acquitted after an 18-week trial.
   A three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals,
which initially upheld the convictions in 1981, ruled unanimously
Friday that the convictions could no longer stand because the law
the men allegedly violated _ conspiracy to commit mail fraud _ later
was altered by the U.S. Supreme Court.
   Roemer, 67, said from his home in Baton Rouge that the experience
was personally devastating.
   ``What did it cost me? Does that count the heart attack and the
health problems that were the result of that? Does it count what my
children and 17 grandchildren went through, and my wife? I was worth
$12 million or $15 million and I took bankruptcy.
   ``Four million dollars went in expense for the trial and
preparation and I lost 10 years of my life. What do you think it
cost me?''
   Roemer's son, Gov. Buddy Roemer, fought back tears when a
reporter told of the decision. ``I'm very happy,'' said the
governor, who stopped for a moment to regain his composure.
   ``I'm sorry. Let me try again ... I'm real pleased and happy. He
(the elder Roemer) has had a real hard time, in many ways unfairly.
He took the bad times like a man.''
   Marcello, 79 and in poor health, is at the Federal Correctional
Institution in Rochester, Minn., where Assistant Warden John Chreno
said Marcello ``has been under constant physicians' care.''
   In the sting, undercover FBI agents posed as crooked insurance
executives. They were convicted of taking part in a scheme to win a
multimillion-dollar state group insurance contract through bribery.
   The government said Marcello and Roemer believed they would split
a commission of $87,000 a month.
   The prosecution alleged they conspired to deprive citizens of
honest government. This latest appeal was based on a Supreme Court
opinion that the mail fraud law is designed to protect money or
property rights _ not intangible rights such as the right to good
government.
   ``The record in this case inexorably leads to one conclusion: the
mail and wire fraud charges were tried as intangible right
offenses,'' the 5th Circuit said.
   ``The indictment charged a scheme to defraud citizens of honest
government, the prosecutor described it as such, and the judge
instructed the jury that it could convict upon finding the existence
of a scheme as charged in the indictment.''
   The FBI had code-named the operation ``Brilab,'' short for
bribery-labor.
   ``I'm sure to Mr. Marcello it's a very significant event but to
the government it's purely academic at this stage,'' said U.S.
Attorney John Volz, who prosecuted both men. ``Both defendants have
served their sentences from that case.''
   Edwards, who dropped his bid for a fourth term after finishing
second to Buddy Roemer in the state's open primary _ said he was
glad for Roemer but expressed outrage at Volz's remark.
   ``I'm very pleased, because there's no doubt in my mind that this
was a political prosecution to begin with,'' said Edwards, reached
at his home in Baton Rouge.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate on Friday passed legislation aimed
at making desecration of the flag unlawful.
   The aim of the amendment, approved by voice vote without dissent,
is to circumvent the effect of a Supreme Court decision earlier in
the week which held that destruction of the flag is protected by the
First Amendment guarantee of free speech.
   ``I'm confident it's constitutional,'' Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del.,
chairman of the judiciary panel and a leading congressional liberal,
told his colleagues. Biden's measure was tacked onto an unrelated
child care bill.
   Biden's measure, which adds a new section to federal law dealing
with defacing U.S. property, makes it a misdemeanor to burn, trample
on, throw down or otherwise deface the flag.
   Biden did not explain how the provision could be constitional
while similar provisions of existing federal law, under the Court's
decision Wednesday, would not be. There was no one in his office
after the Senate session, and no answer at Biden's home.
   Earlier, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said that while lawmakers
are outraged by the high court decision of Wednesday, changing the
Constitution should be viewed with caution.
   Foley, D-Wash., said that ``nobody in the House supports flag
burning. Everyone condemns it and believes that there is ... no
justification for the burning and disrespect to the American flag.''
   But he said he would ``be extraordinarily slow to amend the First
Amendment to the Constitution'' which is ``at the heart of our
constitutional liberties and freedom.''
   About 10 lawmakers have already introduced constitutional
amendments in the wake of the decision, Foley said. But any such
amendment should be the subject of lengthy hearings and discussion
in Congress, he said.
   It was possible the House would consider next week a resolution
similar to the one passed by the Senate this week expressing
opposition to the view of the court.
   Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, a senior Republican on the House
Judiciary Committee, said he was exploring ways of getting around
the decision without a constitutional amendment, possibly by taking
away from the Supreme Court jurisdiction over lawsuits on flag
desecration.
   ``I think the mood of the House is to do something effective and
not just pass resolutions condemning the burning of the flag,'' he
said. A new law would be simpler than a constitutional amendment, he
said.

   China, which played host to both President Bush
and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev this year, has slipped
toward diplomatic isolation because of its repressive policies at
home.
   Tiananmen Square, usually adorned with the flags of a parade of
visiting dignitaries, is ringed instead by martial law troops. The
only high-level visit on the agenda is the foreign minister of Sao
Tome and Principe.
   Once the West's most-favored socialist nation because of its
capitalist-style reforms and its independence from Moscow, China is
almost universally shunned following the military attack on
student-led demonstrators and subsequent mass arrests of protesters.
   China's diplomatic horizons appear similar to those of the 1960s,
when Albania was its best friend and solidarity with Third World
revolutionaries its main purpose.
   The United States has suspended military sales and contacts and
canceled high-level meetings. Canada has recalled its ambassador.
France and the Netherlands have frozen diplomatic relations. Belgium
has banned all official visits and new cooperative projects.
   West Germany has canceled a parliamentary visit and Mexico has
stopped a visit by its foreign minister because of the
``considerable violence.''
   Britain has postponed talks on the return of Hong Kong to China
in 1997 and a planned visit by Prince Charles and Princess Diana
scheduled for the fall is on hold.
   But the nations of Southeast Asia, which see turmoil in their
giant neighbor as a direct threat to their own stability, have been
noticeably sparing in their criticism.
   Philippine President Corazon Aquino expressed sadness over
executions but ``conceded that the matter is within the domestic
jurisdiction of China's courts.''
   Indonesia and Malaysia say they have no intention of interfering
in China's internal affairs.
   Japan has halted high-level contacts and suspended talks on
economic assistance to China but publicly has expressed little more
than ``sorrow and disappointment.'' Japan's cautious approach stems
partly from lingering sensitivities over the great suffering the
Japanese military caused China in World War II.
   Nations that long have courted China are condemning it in
language normally unheard of in cautious diplomatic circles.
Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke spoke of the ``repression and
brutality'' of a government executing those involved in the popular
uprisings. French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas referred to the
``horror'' and ``veritable murders'' of China's ``totalitarian
machine.''
   Even the just-held Congress of the Socialist International has
voiced its outrage, and Gorbachev has warned that a halt in China's
reforms poses a danger to the whole world.
   China's response to the foreign criticism has been muted.
   ``They're being amazingly quiet,'' said one Asian diplomat. ``I
think they'll sit and wait and they honestly believe it will blow
over in three months or so. They'll start getting worried in two
months if it doesn't blow over.''
   Even in criticizing the United States for imposing sanctions, the
government has been careful to avoid a complete rupture. ``The
Chinese side hopes to maintain and develop Sino-U.S. relations,'' a
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said.
   But Premier Li Peng, in a meeting with a Foreign Ministry
delegation from Pakistan, stressed that ``in times of difficulty, it
is very clear who are true friends.''
   Li said those countries that try to exert diplomatic and economic
pressures on China are ``short-sighted and unwise.''
   The premier was speaking from a 2,000-year tradition of
insularity in which the Middle Kingdom thought it had little to gain
and nothing to learn from contacts with the uncivilized nations
beyond its borders.
   Through much of Communist China's 40-year history, the stress on
economic self-sufficiency and the tendency toward xenophobia has
been as strong as during any imperial dynasty.
   Since rising to power and inaugurating an open door policy a
decade ago, Deng Xiaoping has brought dramatic changes to China's
foreign relations.
   In 1979, he ended three decades of mistrust by restoring
relations with the United States. Wartime enemy Japan is now the
major source of development aid. Britain in 1984 agreed to return
Hong Kong in 1997 in a model agreement on the peaceful transfer of
territory.
   In recent years, Deng has revived moribund relations with Eastern
Europe, built solid ties with Thailand and other Asian nations,
ended years of hostility with India, started trade ties with
anti-communist South Korea, and even coaxed Taiwan into more
unofficial contacts.
   In May, Gorbachev came to Beijing for the first Sino-Soviet
summit in 30 years, a triumph for Deng marred by the occupation of
Tiananmen Square by thousands of pro-democracy students.
   Despite some tough words _ government spokesman Yuan Mu said
Chinese ``are not spineless people'' and ``we are not afraid of
condemnation or sanction'' _ China cannot revert to its former
isolation.
   The sharp drop in outside contacts is already taking its toll,
one European diplomat said. ``The line of propaganda tries to put
out that everything is normal,'' he said, ``but at the working level
these measures will not go unnoticed.''
   China badly needs foreign technology, financial assistance and
tourism for its modernization drive, and its leaders have repeatedly
stressed that the open door policy should not be affected by the
domestic turmoil.
   ``What is important is that we should never change China into a
closed country,'' Deng said in a June 9 speech that is being studied
nationwide as the final word on government policy.
   ``In the 150 years since the Opium War, China has always been
practicing the policy of a closed country. Such a policy is most
detrimental to us,'' he said.

<HEAD>Energy Department Agrees to Release Records of Nuclear Workers</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Adds 5 grafs more detail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Department of Energy will allow outside
researchers to examine health records of workers who have been
exposed to radiation at government nuclear projects, the agency
announced Friday.
   The records, which date to the Manhattan Project atomic bomb
experiments of the early 1940s, are considered the largest body of
information on the effects of radiation exposure.
   Records on some 600,000 workers from about 50 government
facilities will be opened for scientific scrutiny.
   The National Academy of Sciences has been given a $297,000 grant
to determine how to make the data public without violating privacy
laws or agreements with state health agencies.
   Spokesman Jeff Sherwood said the agency hoped the records would
be open by fall.
   Energy Secretary James Watkins said in a letter to Sen. John
Glenn, D-Ohio, that he had ordered the department to establish a
national repository for ``all epidemiologically relevant information
on DOE workers.''
   Glenn was one of several lawmakers who had pressed for release of
the data.
   Under questioning at a February House hearing, Troy Wade,
assistant secretary for defense programs, said he didn't know any
reason why the information couldn't be released.
   In addition to information on facilities in his own state, Glenn
has asked the Energy Department for detailed information on the
exposure of workers at the Hanford nuclear reservation in Washington
state, and in his letter Watkins said the department was researching
the answers and letting it be reviewed by department lawyers
``because of ... ongoing litigation'' there.
   The committee Glenn heads also has asked the department to
explain why its epidemiological studies of workers exposed to
radiation did not include workers at the Nevada Test Site and the
Idaho National Engineering Laboratory.
   Some have argued that workers at those sites may have been
exposed to more radiation than any others in the government's
nuclear weapons complex.
   There were above-ground nuclear tests at Nevada until the early
1960s, and Energy Department documents have shown that between 1957
and 1963 there were intentional atmospheric releases of radioactive
gases from the Idaho lab.

   Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi left
for home on Friday to implement a cease-fire that will end 14 years
of civil war with Angola's Marxist government.
   The leader of the U.S.-backed rebels and Angolan President Jose
Eduardo dos Santos signed the truce accord and sealed it with a
handshake late Thursday at a special African summit to promote peace
in Angola.
   ``I was not born to make war at all cost,'' Savimbi said before
leaving to carry word of the cease-fire to his forces. ``Even if I
have made war until now for precise reasons, and even if these
reasons cease to exist, I will always remain, in my skin, a citizen
of Angola.''
   Shooting was to stop at midnight Friday (7 p.m. EDT). Savimbi
told the Zairian news agency he is prepared to work ``without
preconditions'' with dos Santos' government.
   But difficult negotiations still face the rival Angolan parties
in drafting a permanent peace agreement.
   President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, a Savimbi ally credited with
a prominent role in the reconciliation, also will mediate future
negotiations.
   The conservative Mobutu is to meet President Bush in Washington
on Thursday to discuss Zaire's role in helping bring peace to
southern Africa, said Bush's press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler told reporters in
Washington that the summit ``represents a significant breakthrough
in efforts to peacefully resolve Angola's long-running civil war.''
   President Moussa Traore of Mali, chairman of the Organization of
African Unity, announced the cease-fire at a news conference in
Gbadolite, Mobutu's hometown and the palatial site of the summit,
400 miles northeast of Zaire's capital, Kinshasa.
   The summit of 20 African heads of state was the first meeting
between dos Santos and Savimbi since the former allies in a struggle
for black rule went to war in 1975 as Portuguese colonizers left
Angola. The conflict has claimed tens of thousands of casualties.
   Savimbi leads the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola, known as UNITA, which has been backed by China, South Africa
and Washington in its fight to share power with dos Santos' Marxist
Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola.
   The peace accord follows a U.S.-brokered regional peace accord
was signed in New York in December. South Africa, which backed
Savimbi, agreed to grant independence to Namibia, Angola's southern
neighbor, and halt aid to Savimbi's guerrillas in exchange for the
withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops backing dos Santos' government.
Savimbi was not party to the agreement.
   Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda described Thursday's signing of
what is called the Declaration of Gbadolite ``a great moment for
Africa.''
   Kaunda said Savimbi will go into self-exile but did not provide
details. He said a commission elected at the summit would oversee
the integration of rebel fighters into national life.
   The summit adopted an eight-point declaration, drafted by Mobutu
and explicitly accepted by dos Santos and Savimbi, which proclaimed
``the will of the daughters and sons of Angola to put an end to war
and to proclaim their national reconciliation to the world.''
   At a separate news conference, Mobutu said Savimbi ``reaffirmed
that he had no intention of participating in the next government. It
is not up to us to tell the Angolans or Savimbi what title he will
bear.''
   Reports in Zaire said Savimbi's self-exile would be temporary.
   But rebel sources in Washington said the reports are ``all
wrong.''
   ``Savimbi will remain in Angola,'' a rebel official said on
condition of anonymity.
   The accord calls for the creation of a national reconciliation
commission under Mobutu's chairmanship. It set no time or place for
the commission to begin its work and did not specify who would
represent the rival Angolan parties.
   The Portugese news agency LUSA reported Friday that the two sides
would meet ``in the next few days in Zimbabwe to give form to the
Gbadolite accord.'' It gave no details.
   LUSA also reported that dos Santos briefed the 12 members of his
party Politburo in Luanda on details of the accord.
   Diplomatic sources in Kinshasa, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the United States and South Africa deserved credit
for exerting influence on Savimbi, whom they supplied with arms.
   Meanwhile, Angola's government has been under growing pressure to
reach a peaceful settlement from its main arms supplier, the Soviet
Union.

   China arrested at least 20 more pro-democracy
students and their supporters Friday, and the army's propaganda
chief took over as editor-in-chief of the People's Daily, the
Communist Party's official paper.
   The change in editors comes as a campaign is under way to blanket
China with propaganda justifying the harsh suppression of
pro-democracy activists.
   More than 1,700 people have been arrested, and 27 executed, since
a nationwide crackdown began almost three weeks ago.
   Night-shift workers were ordered to make sure they carried their
work identification papers on Saturday because police planned to
step up their search for protesters, a Chinese source said.
   At the People's Daily, the paper's foreign affairs office said
Saturday that Shao Huaze, director of the Propaganda Department of
the People's Liberation Army, replaced Tan Wenrui as chief editor of
China's leading paper.
   It said director Qian Liren also left his post and was replaced
by Gao Di, a senior official in the Central Party School of the
party Central Committee.
   Bot Qian and Tan resigned because of health, the office said,
without elaborating and without specifying when the changes took
place.
   On Saturday, much of the the People's Daily front page was filled
with excerpts of speeches by senior leader Deng Xiaoping going back
to 1979. In them, Deng said China can never abide drifting toward
adopting Western ideas and culture and must strictly adhere to
Communist Party rule.
   The shuffle at the paper came as the party stepped up its drive
to brand participants in the now-crushed student pro-democracy
movement as counterrevolutionaries and justify the arrests and
summary executions of protesters.
   It also appeared aimed at revamping the leadership of the
official media. Hundreds of journalists from all major national
dailies and broadcasting stations participated in pro-democracy
marches, and for a brief time in late May the official press was
freer than it had ever been.
   The press quickly reverted to being an organ for government and
party propaganda after the June 3-4 military drive to quash the
democracy movement that left hundreds, and perhaps thousands of
unarmed people dead.
   Early Friday, there was heavy activity by security forces in
northern Beijing, where several shots were fired and the smell of
tear gas filled the air, residents said.
   There were unconfirmed reports that the Communist Party's Central
Committee had opened a meeting in Beijing to deal with party chief
Zhao Ziyang and propaganda head Hu Qili, who apparently have been
stripped of power.
   The party was expected to act to oust them officially from their
posts and the party for expressing sympathy for demands for a freer
society.
   Top leaders were absent from TV news reports, and a large number
of soldiers checked all vehicles on Beijing's main avenue Friday
night, fueling speculation about a committee meeting.
   Soldiers crushed seven weeks of student-led demonstrations when
they marched into Beijing on the night of June 3-4 and cleared
Tiananmen Square of thousands of protesters.
   The Xinhua News Agency has said nearly 100 soldiers and police
died and that thousands were injured in the subsequent crackdown,
while about 100 civilians died and nearly 1,000 were injured.
Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence sources said the death
toll may have been as high as 3,000.
   Despite international pleas for clemency, authorities executed 27
people Wednesday and Thursday, including seven in Beijing for
attacking soldiers and destroying military vehicles when the army
entered the city.
   Beijing radio Friday reported the arrest of Li Bin, a worker
accused of killing Liu Guogeng, a soldier who was beaten and burned
to death and now regarded as a martyr.
   Evening TV and radio reports said police arrested Liu Xiaobo, an
instructor at Beijing Teacher's University who recently returned
from six months in the United States.
   Liu joined the China Democratic League, an organization of
Chinese dissidents in the United States, and published
anti-communist essays overseas, the reports said. He also called for
an end to one-party rule and was in close contact with leaders of
the democracy movement in Beijing, they said.
   The government has said foreign involvement helped the students
press their movement. On Thursday, authorities arrested 13 people
accused of spying for Taiwan and fomenting unrest.
   CBS News reported 17 students and teachers were arrested at four
universities in Beijing Thursday night and Friday.
   Four student leaders and one worker were arrested in Zhangjiakou,
about 110 miles northwest of Beijing, official Chinese news reports
said.
   People's Daily said in an editorial that pro-democracy protesters
``attempted to use the model of Western capitalist countries to
transform China's hard-won socialist system.''
   ``Class struggle is still going on and we should not lower our
vigilance,'' the editorial said, invoking a rallying cry not heard
since the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution. During that decade,

<HEAD>Kidnapped Army Officer Apparently Killed by Police Bullet</HEAD>

   A kidnapped army colonel killed during
a shootout between police and the abductor apparently was hit by a
police bullet, a spokesman reported Friday.
   Dutch army Col. Karel van de Kieft, 56, was slain Thursday when
police intercepted his car about two hours after he had been
kidnapped by Stefan Kroger, a 33-year-old West German from Hanover
who had fled from a German prison.
   The gunfight occurred after police blocked the car in a service
station on the Arnhem-Utrecht freeway.
   Van de Kieft was killed by a shot in the head but Kroger was not
injured.
   ``According to preliminary findings, he (van de Kieft) was
probably hit by a bullet fired by police,'' said police spokesman
Bert Albers. He reported investigators have not determined the
motive for the abduction and said Kroger is still being questioned.
   At one point during a standoff between Kroger and the police,
Kroger demanded a ransom of one million guilders ($454,000) and 100
grams, or about 3{ ounces, of heroin.
   Television tapes showed policemen with UZI submachineguns
charging toward van de Kieft's Ford Escort from a distance of about
45 feet. The colonel could be seen in the driver's seat slumped
behind the wheel.
   Police said Kroger had a handgun but Albers would not say what
type or caliber.
   Albers said the number of shots fired by police and by Kroger is
still unclear.
   A preliminary autopsy report concluded the colonel ``was killed
by a police bullet, but it has not yet been firmly established,''
the spokesman added.
   He said Van de Kieft was on his way to work when Kroger forced
his way at gunpoint into the colonel's car about 12 miles north of
Arnhem.
   West German authorities reported Kroger had been jailed in
Braunschweig and failed to return from a one-day prison furlough,
according to Albers.
   He said West German officials are preparing an extradition
request for Kroger in connection with an armed robbery in
Braunschweig in which a 70-year-old man was seriously injured.
   Albers said if Kroger is convicted of a crime in the Netherlands
he would have to serve the sentence here before he would be
extradited to West Germany.

   A man was arrested on child abuse and assault
charges after he allegedly tied a belt around his 13-year-old
daughter's neck and forced her to crawl down the street and bark
like a dog, police said.
   Joseph A. Dickson, 42, was released on $1,000 bail following
arraignment Thursday on charges of endangering the welfare of a
child and third-degree assault, said Albany Police Sgt. Robert
Wolfgang.
   Dickson is alleged to have forced the girl to crawl and bark
after she failed to return home on time Wednesday night, Wolfgang
said. ``Apparently he considered it a form of discipline for his
daughter,'' he said.
   ``I told her if you want to act like a dog, then you get down and
crawl like a dog,'' Dickson said at his arraignment.
   Police were called about 4 a.m. Thursday by neighbors who heard
the commotion.

   Jewish holocaust survivors who adjusted best to
life after World War II were able to seal away their traumas so
successfully that they protect even their present-day dreams,
according to an Israeli study.
   The findings suggest that modern techniques of treating
post-traumatic stress syndrome, such as that suffered by Vietnam war
veterans, may actually be aggravating the disorder instead of curing
it, said Peretz Lavie, a psychology professor at Technion-Israel
Institute of Technology in Haifa where the study was conducted.
   In a paper prepared for presentation today at the annual meeting
of the Association of Professional Sleep Societies, Lavie said a
study of a group of survivors of the Holocaust found those who were
the most healthy mentally had learned to suppress recall of
virtually all dreams.
   This, he said, was a defense mechanism against the awful memories
of the Nazi persecution of Jews during World War II.

   The Supreme Court struck a blow against
organized crime and drug dealers by letting the government seize
assets which defendants wish to use to pay their lawyers, the
nation's chief law enforcement officer says.
   But attorneys groups said a pair of high court rulings Thursday
undermines the nation's system of justice _ tipping the balance
unfairly in favor of prosecutors.
   The court, in two 5-4 decisions, upheld the constitutionality of
federal laws that permit the confiscation of money and property from
people accused of crimes _ even if it means they cannot afford a
lawyer.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said the rulings are ``a notable
victory in the government's war on drugs. As the court put it,
Congress did not write this law to rewrite the old adage that `crime
does not pay' to read `crime does not pay except for attorneys'
fees.'''
   But Scott Wallace of the National Association of Criminal Defense
Lawyers said, ``We see these cases as a national tragedy. The
Clarence Darrows of today and tomorrow are going to go into some
other area of the law.''

The 987-foot tanker will undergo nearly a year of repairs costing

   The Supreme Court on Friday refused to shut
down the billion-dollar dial-a-porn industry, thwarting an attempt
by Congress to shield children from sexually oriented telephone
messages.
   The court said in its unanimous decision that Congress went too
far last year when it passed a law banning all sexually oriented
phone message services.
   Only obscene messages _ and not messages that merely are
``indecent'' _ may be outlawed, the court said. It said a blanket
ban would violate free-speech rights.
   ``The case before us today does not require us to decide what is
obscene or what is indecent,'' said Justice Byron R. White, writing
for the court.
   A phone conversation, like an explicit movie or centerfold in an
adult magazine, may or may not be obscene, a designation that must
be decided by local juries on a case-by-case basis.
   Material deemed to be indecent rather than obscene is protected
under the Constitution.

   This school district boasts it has slashed
its dropout rate in half by offering students alternatives such as
day care centers, vocational training for the disabled and night
classes for working teens.
   The key, said Quincy school officials, is giving potential
dropouts offers they can hardly refuse and lavishing attention on
students at risk of dropping out.
   ``The secret is, a kid can't drop out without going through a
long program of help-providers,'' said Schools Superintendent Robert
Ricci on Friday.
   ``It's nothing that hasn't been done. But most districts aren't
that flexible,'' Ricci said. ``There's a blueprint here for urban
districts.''
   Ricci calculated the dropout rate by following a group of
students from ninth grade through the day they should graduate. The
traditional method is to compare senior classes from year to year.
By tracking incoming ninth-graders, the schools can more accurately
assess whether the programs are working, experts said.

<HEAD>Late-Night Dining Spots Hard to Find in London</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   You've just been to the theater and want a
leisurely, late-night meal in Europe's largest city and a world
cultural capital. Easy, right? In London, not necessarily.
   ``The other night after the show, we were trying to find a place
to eat, and there was no place to go,'' said Ann Crumb, the American
star of Andrew Lloyd Webber's new smash musical, ``Aspects of
Love,'' at the Prince of Wales Theater.
   The places that serve up to midnight or later are few. They are
led by the American-owned Orso and Joe Allen in Covent Garden, both
frequented by theater people, and an array of Chinese restaurants in
Soho that stay open until the wee hours.
   Elsewhere, the choices are slim. Up to 11 p.m., London is abuzz
with activity. Then, suddenly, it becomes a graveyard of upended
restaurant chairs, littered sidewalks and lost souls torn between
that elusive last drink and the last bus home.
   Only Soho and Covent Garden are alive past midnight.
   ``It's totally antiquated and stupid,'' said Drew Smith of the
Consumers' Association and a food writer and critic for The Guardian
newspaper.
   `I think it's very unfortunate that in a major international city
you don't have the late-night restaurant service that should go with
it.''
   But London's attitude toward late-night dining is symptomatic of
life as a whole. The English generally call it quits early. Many bus
routes are suspended after rush hour, the subway stops soon after
midnight, the law requires pubs to serve last drinks at 10:50 p.m.
BBC-TV goes off the air around midnight, although the two commercial
networks operate all night.
   ``So much of it has to do with the style of living here,'' said
Richard Polo, the American restaurateur who manages Joe Allen and
Orso. ``You can go to Paris at 1 a.m. and see restaurants full of
people; London's not like that.''
   Polo came to London in 1977 to open Joe Allen here following its
success in New York. Its more upmarket sister establishment, Orso,
opened in 1985, and Polo says both do about one-quarter of their
daily business after the curtain falls. Last orders at Orso are at
12 Midnight; at Joe Allen, 12:45 a.m.
   Theater curtains rise in London at 7:30 and 8 p.m. and fall
between 10 and 11 p.m.
   Englishman Peter Ward, who manages the central London restaurants
Inigo Jones and the newly opened Burt's, says the problem is in the
national temperament.
   ``We're not an eating-out society,'' he said. ``Continentals and
New Yorkers together are much more serious eaters than British and
the Londoners.''
   ``The moment it's curtain down, people are on their way back to
Croydon or Brighton,'' Ward added. ``There's less of the joy in the
social gathering of eating. Here, it's a chore and a necessity.''
   Geography and the law play a part. Where New York's Manhattan and
Paris are relatively compact, London's urban sprawl makes it
impractical to walk home from a post-theater meal. Those who miss
the last subway have no way home except in relatively expensive
taxis or irregular night buses.
   Places wanting to serve late face a morass of legal red tape. The
Extended Hours Order covers restaurants open until 1 a.m. and the
Special Hours Certificate allows for openings up to 2 a.m. or, in
central London, 3 a.m., provided there is music and dancing.
   David Lavendar, a London lawyer who specializes in licensing
issues, said the law allowed ``a wholly artificial restriction on
hours.''
   ``In France, you must close half an hour out of every 24, and
that's for cleaning,'' said Lavendar. ``Here, a publican can be
prosecuted for leaving a drink on the table at 11:21 p.m.''
   Jeremy Rounds, food critic of The Independent newspaper, also
deplores this state of affairs, but believes London isn't unique.
   ``I'm always surprised in America by how early America closes
down,'' he said. ``Try getting a meal late in Atlanta.''
   ``The very best places at an international level are the sorts
that in other capitals wouldn't be open late either,'' he added.
   ``Dewy-eyed young men have been telling me for years there's
nowhere to eat late in London,'' said Peter Boizot, proprietor of
the Pizza Express chain and chairman of the Soho Restaurateurs'
Association, which has more than 50 member eateries.
   ``But in my experience,'' he said, ``the ones that have opened
are not that well-frequented.''

   When you are selling eternal salvation, the
Rev. Tom Forrest says, there is no room for small thinking.
   So the Brooklyn-born Roman Catholic preacher thinks big.
   He is the driving force behind Lumen 2000, a controversial group
that wants to give the Roman Catholic Church its own form of
``televangelism'' _ on a world scale.
   Since its founding in 1986, Lumen has set up media schools,
produced a popular soap opera and distributed scores of TV and video
programs to Africa, Latin America and Asia.
   But critics, particularly in Latin America, charge Lumen 2000 is
a conservative arm of the Vatican, threatening to supplant local
initiatives.
   ``They think we're going to go in like the big ugly American and
take over,'' said an official at Lumen's office in Rome, the Rev.
Jim Bermingham.
   With the tacit approval of the pope, Lumen is aiming to be a
private-sector answer to one of the Vatican's dearest wishes: to
harness television to spread the faith.
   ``The Catholic Church is backward in television communications,''
said Forrest, a wiry, 61-year-old former missionary who heads
Evangelization 2000, the umbrella organization that includes Lumen.
   ``TV is not only the best means of communication today, it's the
most expensive ... and the most requiring of utter professionalism.''
   In 1987, Lumen co-sponsored a satellite hook-up through which
Pope John Paul II led Catholics on five continents in prayer.
   Lumen _ the name comes word meaning a measure of the flow of
light _ differs from Protestant ``televangelists'' such as Pat
Robertson or Jimmy Swaggart in providing a variety of programs with
few dominant personalities.
   Its Dallas-based film library offers Catholic groups around the
world a choice of footage and more than 1,000 inspirational
programs, many donated by such Catholic media groups as the New
York-based Christophers or Mother Angelica, a nun who runs a cable
network in Birmingham, Ala.
   Lumen also donates equipment and trains Third World TV
journalists at its centers in Dallas and Bogota, Colombia.
   But Lumen's ultimate aim is to establish Christian entertainment
good enough to compete with top-run programs on regular television.
   ``I think we could do programming _ all visuals, not just talking
heads,'' Forrest said in an interview. ``I believe we have very
exciting answers.''
   Lumen produced its first entertainment program last year, a
miniseries about a Latin American priest. ``Semilla de Mostaza''
(Mustard Seed) was popular enough to get commercial sponsorship on
Colombian television. Lumen has another series in the works.
   Lumen's other major program, a TV ``newsmagazine'' about the
church intended for use worldwide, will be ready early next year.
   Lumen has been influenced by its founders' membership in the
Catholic ``charismatic'' movement, which emphasizes personal
spirituality and spreading the faith.
   Those goals have brought the group into conflict with another
movement in the church _ liberation theology.
   Liberation theology, which has flourished in Latin America,
although the Vatican rejects parts of it, stresses activism on
behalf of the oppressed and encourages a local focus.
   Some of its proponents accuse Lumen leaders of being ``spiritual
colonialists'' for their worldwide ambitions and emphasis on the
church hierarchy.
   ``Lumen 2000 is evidence of the success of the theology of
liberation and of the fear and anger it arouses in conservative
groups,'' said Jose Queiroz, a theologian who coordinates the
religious studies post-graduate program at Catholic University in
Sao Paulo, Brazil.
   Bishop Tomas Balduino, a leading progressive based in the
Brazilian state of Goias, recently was quoted by the Jornal do
Brasil newspaper in Rio de Janeiro as saying Evangelization 2000
``is an illegitimate and nefarious project trying to enter through
the back door without asking the Brazilian bishops' permission.''
   Lumen leaders say they follow the guidelines of the Vatican,
which opposes the forms of liberation theology that stress Marxist
principles.
   They brush the criticism aside.
   ``It has been quite extraordinary to see, because of the
incredible fantasies,'' Forrest said. ``Like I'm supposed to have
$400 million. They have us getting money from the CIA.''
   Lumen gets most of its money from a foundation created by Piet
Dirksen, a Dutch millionaire and charismatic who is Lumen's
president.
   Lumen has had its greatest growth in Latin America, despite the
criticism that emanates from there. It focuses on the Third World,
where the church is expanding and television time is often available
to religious groups for little cost.
   Church officials stress, however, that Lumen is not a Vatican
project.
   ``It's a private initiative with a very commendable purpose,
which is to spread the word of God through the communications
media,'' said the president of the Vatican's Commission on Social
Communications, Archbishop John Foley, an American with a degree
from Columbia Journalism School.
   In a recent speech, Pope Paul said: ``The question confronting
the church today is not any longer whether the man in the street can
grasp a religious message, but how to employ the communications
media so as to let him have the full impact of the Gospel message.''

   ``I am a farmer by birth, and in no
time in my life have things been so difficult as now.''
   Park Sung-hwan was telling a visitor to his 4-acre farm how
difficult it has been for him, and other South Korean farmers, since
South Korea switched emphasis from the farm to the factory.
   Like thousands of other South Korean farmers, the 55-year-old
Park is fighting to stay in business.
   Farmers face mounting debts, growing foreign competition, a
disintegration of farm families and an inability to make their tiny
holdings produce enough.
   South Korea's agricultural sector remains reliant on manual labor
and farms still are small.
   But many farmers blame the United States for their problems,
claiming U.S. trade pressure to increase food imports to South Korea
to reduce the U.S. trade deficit is driving them out of business.
   ``The United States is no longer my friend,'' Park said. ``They
are destroying my family.''
   Park earns the equivalent of about $10,000 a year growing rice
and tobacco. Rice, tobacco, fruit and vegetables are South Korea's
main crops. The United States now is exporting wheat, corn, tobacco,
fruit, meat and cotton to South Korea; the main competition for
South Korean farmers is in tobacco, fruit and, in some areas, meat.
   Park says he does not bring in enough money to keep the farm
running and support his wife and three children.
   His income dropped 30 percent after U.S. cigarette imports cut
his tobacco sales, he said. He has been unable to pay interest on a
bank loan of $13,000 he took five years ago and the debt has swollen
to $15,000.
   ``I have no hope and feel like dying,'' he said outside his
two-room house in Hwasung, 60 miles south of Seoul. ``I have no one
to turn to for help.''
   Suicide has become a problem among hard-pressed Korean farmers.
About a dozen farmers under financial pressure have committed
suicide this year, according to the Catholic Farmers' Association.
   During an agricultural slump in 1983-84, as many as 40 farmers,
unable to pay back government loans they used to buy cattle, took
their lives, the association said.
   Agricultural experts say chronic farm problems may cause serious
social unrest and they urge the government to restructure the farm
industry.
   ``The farm situation has reached its limit and become a serious
political issue,'' said Huh Shin-haeng, an agricultural specialist
with the state-financed Korea Rural Economic Institute.
   Poor management, low investment, poor irrigation, a lack of
arable land and the lack of mechanization make farming increasingly
uneconomical, Huh said.
   He added that South Korea's farm population of 8.4 million
people, about one-fifth of the population, is declining at an annual
rate of 450,000 people as young farmers leave the countryside for
the better life of the cities. Many young men cannot find brides if
they stay on the farm.
   While no figures are available on how many farmers are in
financial trouble, Huh estimated that the debt among South Korea's
1.8 million farm families averages out to $4,200 per household, a
large sum by Korean standards. The money is owed to the state-run
Agricultural Cooperative.
   The United States, which during the past two years had a trade
deficit of $18.3 billion with South Korea, is pushing to open the
Korean market to American goods, especially the agriculural sector.
   South Korea is Washington's second largest farm market after
Japan. South Korea purchased $2.3 billion worth of American farm
products last year.
   But U.S. officials say the South Korean market is still far from
open to imports and further trade liberalization is needed. The
United States wants the same open access to South Korean markets
that South Korea has to American markets.
   Under U.S. pressure, South Korea opened its cigarette market,
estimated at $1.2 billion a year, in 1987.
   That hurt Park and other tobacco growers.
   But Park and other farmers say the South Korean government is as
much to blame for the problems facing many farming families. Farmers
complain that the government has favored industry to increase
exports and done little to help the agricultural sector.
   ``Why does the government sacrifice poor farmers to export more
cars, television sets and VCR's?'' Park asked.
   The government recently announced plans to pour $20 billion into
mordernizing the farm industry by 1995. But the news was received
with skepticism by many farmers and government critics.
   ``We farmers have been deceived so many times,'' said Bae
Jong-yul, a dissident leader. ``It is doubtful that the foundering
farm industry can be transformed in several years.''
   Bae, a farmer who is co-chairman of the nation's largest
dissident organization, the United National Democratic Movement,
said farmers must become politically aware and unite to protect
their interests.
   He said his group plans a nationwide campaign to oppose foreign
agricultural imports.
   ``Of course, the main target will be the United States,'' he
added.

<HEAD>Comic Teen-Age Bounty Hunters in `B-Men'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Now why would CBS not buy a series about comic
teen-age bounty hunters?
   ``B-Men'' airs Tuesday, the latest offering in the ``CBS Summer
Playhouse'' series. ``Summer Playhouse'' is a nice name for dud
pilots.
   James MacDonald and David Arnott, a sort of Dan Aykroyd-John
Belushi-inspired pairing, star as two wise-mouth high schoolers who
win a $25,000 reward after accidentally capturing the ``714
killer,'' a crazed motorcycle madman who kills people who live in
the 714 area code.
   Despite a convoluted plotline and bumpy direction, the pilot does
have its moments of wit, thanks to the satiric script by Dave
Thomas, a former member of SCTV, and Rick Kellard. They are also
co-executive producers.
   CBS no doubt made the right decision in not picking this one up,
based on the pilot. Ultimately there's too much dumb stuff to wade
through to get to the few good parts.
   But in the midst of all the predictable bunk on summer rerun TV,
fans of send-up might find ``B-Men'' worth a look. While many of the
jokes don't work, there are several smiles, and even an occasional
outright laugh or two. Talk-show host Joe Franklin makes a cameo
appearance as himself. Cut to the boys out on the street carrying
the ungainly 5-by 3-foot cardboard check, the reward presented to
them by the city on Franklin's show. They successfully deposit it in
a normal-size bank.
   Jim (MacDonald) decides that $25,000 for bagging the biker is the
perfect launching pad for a lucrative new career. But Kevin (Arnott)
is skeptical. To be a bounty hunter, he argues, ``you have to have a
beard that grows twice a day!''
   There's a poke at the prevailing teen-appeal view of '80s parents
when Jim informs his folks over dinner about his new after-school
job. ``So, how are you going to juggle this and school?'' wonders
distracted Dad (James Staley). ``I don't think it's going to
interfere with my schoolwork, Dad,'' Jim insists. ``Well, fine,''
says Dad. ``Pass the veggies, dear.''
   Jim, convinced that bounty hunting will be a snap, tears wanted
posters off the post office bulletin board. ``Go home and tell your
children the streets are safe again!'' he announces to a wary line
of postal patrons.
   At night, Jim and Kevin cruise seedy Hollywood Boulevard, copying
TV cops who always find miscellaneous sleazoids and ladies of the
night to tell them where the criminals are hiding. ``Want a date?''
queries a scantily clad woman. ``No, thanks,'' says Kevin. ``We're
looking for hookers.''
   Jim and Kevin set themselves up with a wildly art-deco,
after-school office and hire a va-va-voom secretary (Kimberly
Foster) who impresses their schoolmates by showing up during class
to deliver messages.
   The plot is overcomplicated by the intrustion of a madman police
lieutenant (John Vernon), a real bounty hunter (Albert Salmi), and a
comic gang of motorcycle toughs who enlist the escaped ``714
killer'' (David Patrick Kelly). He, in the spirit of the cartoonish
violence, is repeatedly beaned, beaten and run down by cars, only to
pop up again like Wile E. Coyote.
   The plot thickens even further when the boys' secretary is
kidnapped by the gang. ``We can't quit now,'' declares Kevin. ``We
sure can't,'' agrees Jim. Kevin reconsiders. ``But wouldn't it be
great if we could?''
   There is more in ``B-Men'' that doesn't work than does, but
Thomas and Kellard at least tried something a little different.
Hopefully, they'll try again.

<HEAD>Bedford-Stuyvesant: A Movie Grows in Brooklyn</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A grim abandoned building now stands on
Stuyvesant Avenue, the defining boulevard of Brooklyn's historic
Bedford-Stuyvesant, where Sal's Famous Pizzeria squeezed racial
tensions to a tragic head in Spike Lee's explosive new movie, ``Do
the Right Thing.''
   The Korean grocery that faced Sal's across the street is also
gone, removed from the lot of Constance Newkirk, one of the
neighborhood's senior residents. She stood before her home on the
corner of Quincy Street and Stuyvesant Avenue one recent sunny day,
reminiscing about the brief upheaval last May when the celebrated
filmmaker and his crew invaded the area with its movie magic.
   ``I got to know quite a few of them,'' Newkirk said. ``I wanted
to know what was going on. I met Spike and the fellows that were
building. They had to take measurements for my house, corners,
windows and everything.
   ``They built the pizza parlor across the street. They had all the
equipment, anything you would need to make pizza. They came in big
trucks, brand new ovens, ice machines, soda fountains, tiffany
lights, pictures, the whole works.''
   Lee, whose award-winning thesis work for New York University Film
School also took place in Bedford-Stuyvesant, chose one of the
nation's oldest black communities as the location for ``Do the Right
Thing.''
   The action takes place during a sweltering summer in and around
Sal's Famous Pizza, run by an Italian (Danny Aiello) in a
lower-middle-class section of Brooklyn's largely black
Bedford-Stuyvesant. Tensions of family, race, friendship and love
run high. Tensions between Sal's hothead and racist son, Vito, and
an angry black, Radio Raheem, lead to the Raheem's murder by police
and the destruction of the pizza parlor.
   Bedford-Stuyvesant's reputation has fallen on bad times in recent
years, but in fact, this most populous of urban black communities
contains some of New York City's most ornate brownstones, some of
them designated landmarks. Many of the dwellings have been owned by
middle-class black families for generations. And affluent black
professionals live close to some of the city's toughest blocks.
   Newkirk has seen her neighborhood change dramatically,
remembering the lush trees that once lined the block and the lovely
gaslights that turned on at dusk. But hard economic times and drugs
have affected her community; a crack house on the block was closed
before production on the film started.
   Still, Newkirk, who has lived in the same house for over 50
years, can not recall any incident like the race riot that comes at
end of ``Do the Right Thing.''
   ``It's a peaceful neighborhood, definitely, considering with the
crack and everything,'' she said. ``On the whole, this place is
pretty quiet _ no robberies or shootings. We have very little
trouble.''
   During all the years Newkirk has lived on Stuyvesant Avenue,
Edward Alexis Connors has been her neighbor. He proudly described
Newkirk's home as a local landmark, built more than a century ago,
and agreed that the block is a peaceful one, with little trouble
from kids or police.
   ``We make it peaceful,'' Connors said. ``We don't turn the other
cheek. We had some static but we handled it. We have a good police
force and an excellent fire force.''
   The nearest pizzeria, C&amp;M Pizza, is a few blocks away on
Broadway, a heavily commercial street. Matt, the store's owner for
12 years, is an Hispanic who has never experienced the troubles with
local black kids as Sal did in ``Do the Right Thing.''
   In the movie, a black nationalist named Buggin Out (Giancarlo
Esposito) incites a violent confrontation when he demands that Sal
include famous blacks on his ``wall of fame'' instead of the
Italian-Americans whose photographs paper the wall. Sal refuses,
insisting that it's his pizzeria and he's Italian.
   ``You get a hard time any place you go, but I've had no racial
problems,'' said Matt, who asked that his last name not be used.
``You get crack dealers, but who doesn't? I don't allow that in
here. They go out in the street.''
   Jo Rob Turner, 31, and Justice Carter, 29, have lived in
Bedford-Stuyvesant most of their lives. They sipped Cokes and talked
about their neighborhood while sitting at a table at C&amp;M.
   ``Blacks, Puerto Ricans and Orientals hang out together,'' Turner
said. ``There are a lot of interracial couples, more than in the
'60s and the '70s.
   ``White folks come here without being bothered. You notice? It's
not something that happens every single day, but ain't you walkin'
lovely?''
   ``The media makes it more extreme,'' Carter said. ``Everybody
seems OK. You don't see that much racial stuff as before.
Everybody's trying to get along. There's been a lot of acceptance of
minorities.''
   The neighborhood in Lee's movie consists of blacks, Hispanics,
Italians, Koreans and a white bike-riding ``urban pioneer'' played
by John Savage.
   Carter and Turner agreed that crack is Bedford-Stuyvesant's
greatest problem.
   ``Crack has altered lives in phenomenal ways,'' Turner said.
``That is the worst, baddest drug that ever hit the market. I've
seen kids, 11 or 12 years old, eating out of vials of crack.''
   ``The first time you take that puff, you're off to a race,'' said
Carter, who talked of the absence of drugs in the movie. ``The story
was about racism, and that was going to sell.''
   Turner said ``Do the Right Thing'' could help outsiders
understand life in Bedford-Stuyvesant, but quickly added that a film
can never replace first-hand knowledge.
   ``That's a blessing and a curse,'' he said. ``A blessing because
some of the things that we've encountered, we can't believe we
actually got through it. ``But it also makes you're blind to one
side. There's book knowledge and street knowledge and you've got to
walk the streets. You've got to want to know, and that's the only
way to better understanding.''

<TEXT>
   Gilberto Campos was alarmed when he
found his sons sniffing green rocks that kids carried away from the
municipal dump.
   Fourteen-year-old Luis and 18-year-old Jose lurched and stumbled
in the unpaved streets, occasionally pulling a sock out of a pocket
and sniffing it. The socks held a bright green, rocky substance that
smelled like airplane glue or spray paint. When crushed and sniffed,
it gave the same cheap highs.
   The rocks surfaced in March and quickly became the drug of choice
around the vast dump, an area where the well-off live in cinderblock
houses and others make do with cardboard huts. Young children
flocked to it, according to dozens of worried parents interviewed by
Juarez newspapers.
   ``It makes people stupid and aggressive _ more aggressive than a
drunk,'' said Campos, whose sons shoved and hit him when he
confronted them. They ``would lie on the couch and wouldn't get up.''
   The green rocks proved to be toxic waste dumped by a
``maquiladora,'' one of 275 U.S.-owned factories located in Juarez
to take advantage of cheap labor. Mexican environmental suspect
maquiladoras improperly dispose of half their hazardous waste. That
would be hundreds of tons a year in Juarez alone.
   The officials in Juarez say they have gotten rid of the green
rocks and cracked down on toxic wastes at the dump, but gangs of
toughs known as ``cholos'' still collect and sell intoxicating
substances.
   Campos didn't know any of that in late March when he took some of
the rocks to a reform school principal. She didn't know what they
were.
   About the same time, a woman walked into the Centro de
Integracion Juvenil, a drug treatment center for children, and told
psychologist Raul Bueno that her 10-year-old son was sniffing green
rocks. ``She said that at the dump, there were lots of other
children who used this.''
   Bueno, who estimates that about 200 children experimented with
the substance, sent it to the Secretariat Urban Development and
Ecology, or SEDUE _ the beleaguered equivalent of the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency.
   SEDUE identified it as solidified Kaltex, an industrial solvent
containing toluene, a petroleum derivative that can cause lung
damage.
   A doctor told Campos the Kaltex did more than that to his sons.
``When they get married, they can't have children,'' Campos said.
   Infertility is one possible side effect when adolescents use
inhalants like toluene, said Dr. Antonio Carrasco of the La Fe
family clinic in south El Paso, where inhalant abuse is widespread.
If users don't become infertile, their children are likely to be
deformed.
   Inhalants harm the liver and kidneys and can cause organic brain
syndrome _ characterized by loss of coordination, irritability,
chronic confusion and nerve injury, Carrasco said. And they can
destroy tear ducts.
   ``After a while, they can't even cry, and they're subject to eye
infections,'' he said. ``I think inhalant abuse is one of the worst
_ and it's one of the most available for young kids.''
   Parents reported seeing cholos jumping onto trucks turning off
Avenue of the Aztecs onto the dirt road leading to the dump. The
cholos would toss five-, 10- and 20-gallon plastic buckets of waste
off to sell. When SEDUE officials inspected the dump April 6, they
found dozens of buckets of Kaltex.
   Campos, who kept several chunks of Kaltex as souvenirs, said a
piece the size of his foot goes for 10,000 pesos _ about $4.35.
   In late April, SEDUE traced the Kaltex to Outboard Marine de
Mexico, which makes parts for Johnson and Evinrude outboard boat
engines.
   Officials at the Waukegan, Ill.-based manufacturer referred all
questions to Tim Anklam, manufacturing engineer in the Juarez plant.
   Anklam said news reports about the solvent residue had been
greatly exaggerated and that representatives from the factory and
SEDUE scoured the dump in late April and found three five-gallon
plastic buckets that had originated at Outboard Marine de Mexico,
called Omex for short.
   ``Omex accepts the possibility that the three pails ... could
have been dumped by accident at the Juarez landfill. It was just a
human error, if in fact it is ours. A lot of companies use similar
materials around here,'' said Anklam, adding that Omex is
cooperating with SEDUE and acting legally.
   Mexican law requires hazardous waste from maquiladoras to be
returned to their place of origin, usually the United States. U.S.
law requires companies returning hazardous waste to Texas to notify
the Texas Water Commission, which shares information with the EPA.
   But Roger Meacham, EPA spokesman in Dallas, said tracking waste
through paperwork is time-consuming _ and even if the EPA had no
record of a company returning waste to the United States, it
wouldn't mean much.
   ``If the wastes are from raw materials from Mexico, they can be
disposed of in Mexico,'' he said. ``Or if it's recyclable, it can be
recycled in Mexico. Or they can store their waste on-site in Mexico
indefinitely.''
   Rosa Manuela Salas, chief of SEDUE's office in Juarez, said Omex
is complying with Mexican law. She referred all other questions to
Carlos James, communications chief for SEDUE. James did not return
numerous calls to his home and office from The Associated Press.
   Ms. Salas told the newspaper Diario de Juarez that Omex was the
first maquiladora to be caught throwing toxic waste into the Juarez
dump. ``To ensure this doesn't happen again, we're giving an
identification number to each business that generates waste, to make
it easier to watch them.''
   But it is difficult for SEDUE to keep watch. The agency has 10
inspectors in Juarez to monitor 275 maquiladoras and at least 100
Mexican-owned factories. Faced with a crushing national debt, a
severe housing shortage and a population boom that adds 1 million
people to the work force a year, Mexico's government has not been
able to make environmental protection a high priority.
   So far, SEDUE's plan doesn't seem to be working. Luis Hernandez,
the dump's foreman, said he doesn't know what's in the scores of
trucks that deposit waste in the landfill daily. Neither do the
drivers, he said.
   But the cholos seem to know. They still wait at the corner where
trucks turn to go to the dump. They still jump on, and they still
toss buckets off the speeding trucks for collection later.
   Luis Campos takes part.
   ``There are 10 other kinds of intoxicants there,'' Gilberto
Campos said. ``Paint, adhesive ....''
   He shrugged helplessly, lowered his gaze, and sighed.

<HEAD>Lionel Stander Plays Blacklisted Writer in `The Boys'</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The premiere episode of Showtime's new comedy
series, ``The Boys,'' recalls a not-so-funny real-life time in
Lionel Stander's life.
   Stander plays a writer who was blacklisted during the McCarthy
era. Stander himself spent 13 years working as a stockbroker after
he was blacklisted as a film actor for calling members of the House
Un-American Activities Committee ``un-American.''
   The gravel-voiced actor, best known for his TV role as Sam on
``Hart to Hart,'' stars in the new series with Norm Crosby, Norman
Fell and Jackie Gayle as members of a fading hangout for New York
actors called the Excalibur Club.
   ``The Boys'' premiered last season as a special. It makes its
debut as a series Saturday on Showtime.
   In the season opener, Gene Case, Stander's character, recounts
his days as a blacklisted writer who used a stand-in so he could
continue to work.
   ``Nobody knows Gene had been using a front until a producer had
enough guts to put his name on a script,'' Stander said. ``He tells
this to a young man in the club as he tries to explain the hysteria
of the time. People were called traitors simply for dissenting.
   ``I was blacklisted when I went before the Un-American Activities
Committee and called them `un-American.' I condemned the committee,
and history proved me right. But I was blacklisted anyway. I became
a stockbroker and made more money than I ever had as an actor. But I
wasn't happy.''
   Stander, who had made his film debut in 1932, was unable to find
work as an film and television actor between 1950 and 1963. He did
some work in the theater, since it ignored the blacklisting. He came
back to film when director Tony Richardson offered him a role in
``The Loved One.''
   ``It's illegal to blacklist someone,'' Stander said. ``They tried
to force Richardson to drop me. He said put it in writing. They
couldn't do that. I was hired.''
   Stander, who had once worked as a reporter on the New York
Evening Journal, played a reporter in ``The Loved One.''
   He said he accepted the role in ``The Boys'' when they ``made me
an offer I couldn't refuse.''
   ``We have some great writing,'' he said. ``The writers used to
work on `Saturday Night Live.' It's a good cast and a good premise.
Having it at the club is a formula that allows for guest stars. We
also deal with topical issues.''
   Stander was on ABC's ``Hart to Hart'' in 1979-84 and is sorry the
show was canceled.
   ``We were No. 12 in the ratings, but the network president
canceled us so he could put in his favorite show, which was 48th,''
he said. ``It failed. I played the pal of the star, Robert Wagner.
That's a role I've played for 50 years. I was Gary Cooper's pal in
`Mr. Deeds Goes to Town.'''
   Stander came to Hollywood in 1935 after working on stage and in
radio and film in New York. He worked on radio with Eddie Cantor,
Fanny Brice and Fred Allen, whom he called ``the most literate
comedian America ever had.''
   He worked in more than a hundred films in this country and in the
mid-1960s moved to Italy and appeared in about 50 Italian movies. He
was a bartender in Sergio Leone's ``Once Upon a Time in the West.''
He returned to this country in 1971 to co-star in ``The Gang That
Couldn't Shoot Straight.''
   It was a guest starring role in ``It Takes a Thief,'' a 1960s ABC
series starring Wagner, that led to his casting in ``Hart to Hart.''
   ``He came to Rome to film an episode and I was cast in it,''
Stander said. ``When they were going to start `Hart to Hart' he
remembered me and suggested me for the role of Sam.''
   Stander also has been in such movies as ``The Black Bird,'' ``The
Cassandra Crossing,'' ``New York, New York'' and ``The Wicked
Stepmother,'' in which he played Bette Davis' husband.

defeating first a White House-backed alternative based almost
entirely on tax relief.
   The Democratic leadership's victory in the showdown left its
multibillion-dollar plan as the centerpiece of the Senate's
child-care legislation.
   Under an agreement between the parties, the debate continued
Thursday on a number of proposed amendments, with Republicans
seeking to tack parts of their defeated tax-credit plan onto
Democratic measure.

   The stock market rallied after a three-session slide, recovering
most of its losses. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials gained
17.26 points to close at 2,482.17.
   Bond prices rose despite a decline in the dollar against major
currencies.
   Also Thursday, sugar futures prices surged; corn and soybean
futures wilted as rain arrived in Iowa; coffee futures rallied; and
energy, precious-metals and livestock and meat futures were mixed.

<HEAD>Performance for a Price: 100-Octane `Super Juice' Gas Back at the
Pumps</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gas-guzzling dinosaurs graze
alongside the most modern machines at Margaret Crane's mini-mart,
their owners lining up for the privilege of paying $2.59 cents for a
gallon of gas.
   But what a gallon of gas it is _ unleaded, 100-octane racing fuel
_ super juice for the almost-extinct ``muscle cars'' of the 1960s
and the sports cars of tomorrow.
   ``I had one man come in here with a beautiful sports car and he
said his car deserved it. Some (other) man just put in $44,'' said
Ms. Crane, manager of the Unocal 76 station in this well-to-do
suburb north of Chicago.
   ``I thought when I first got it, at $2.59 I'd never sell it.''
   But after two months of offering the gas, she noted, ``They don't
seem to mind about the money.''
   Stuart Cannes, Unocal's manager of racing-product sales, said the
gasoline is available at about 450 service stations nationwide,
including some two dozen in Illinois.
   ``Performance is back in vogue,'' Cannes said. ``There's no other
product that a customer with a 70,000-dollar automobile would put in
his gas tank.''
   Ms. Crane said most of her buyers are people in their 20s and 30s
who own late-model Porsches, Corvettes, Camaros, Trans Ams and
motorcycles, or the muscle cars of an earlier era _ GTOs,
Roadrunners and Chargers.
   Most buyers mix the racing gas with a lower octane gas _ about 92
or 93 for super-unleaded _ and come out with an average of 96
octane, Cannes said. Most cars run on 87-octane gasoline.
   Cannes said a higher octane level helps a ``high-performance
engine run to its peak performance.''
   But he also said that Los Angeles-based Unocal is not encouraging
drivers to push their cars beyond speed limits, or to race through
the streets.
   Dick Tippie, director of transportation safety for the
Chicago-based National Safety Council, said the council would be
opposed to any kind of product that might encourage people to speed
or drive recklessly.
   ``It may not be promoting it, but it's one of those things that
might lead, especially the younger driver, to think he could operate
a vehicle differently than he could under normal circumstances,''
Tippie said.

<HEAD>Paramount Seeks Dismissal of Time Suit on Hostile Takeover Bid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the latest legal salvo in the fight for the
magazine and cable giant Time Inc., Paramount Communications Inc.
asked a federal court to dismiss a suit that could block its $10.7
billion takeover bid for Time.
   Paramount, a publisher and movie and TV producer, also asked the
U.S. District Court here to block Time's $14 billion tender offer
for Warner Communications Inc., a film and records company.
   Paramount made those requests Thursday in response to a suit Time
filed last week in an effort to thwart Paramount from proceeding
with its offer.
   Time and Warner are locked in combat with Paramount over how to
create one of the world's largest communications companies. Time and
Warner proposed a merger, but Paramount showed up with an uninvited
offer for Time.
   Their two-week-old fight has moved in recent days to the courts.
   On Wednesday, Paramount asked the Delaware Chancery Court to
block the Time bid for Warner. A hearing on that case has been set
for July 11.
   In response to Time's federal suit on Thursday, Paramount struck
back at suggestions that its takeover of Time would damage the
journalistic integrity and independence of Time's publications.
   It said Time failed to disclose enough information about legal
problems Warner executives faced in the 1970s and early 1980s.
   Time and Warner called Paramount's filing an ``act of
desperation.''
   In consolidated trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Time fell
$1.87{ a share to $155.37{, Warner rose 62{ cents a share to
$59.12{, and Paramount lost 75 cents a share to $58.50.
   Time had agreed in March to merge with Warner in a stock swap,
but amended that plan last week to provide for a $70-a-share tender
offer for Warner.
   In announcing the new deal, Time rejected Paramount's
$175-a-share offer for all of Time's shares and filed suit in U.S.
District Court in New York to block Paramount from proceeding with
its offer. It said Paramount had made false and misleading
statements in pursuing Time.
   In response, Paramount counterclaimed on Thursday that Time had
made ``misleading statements and material omissions designed to
deceive Time stockholders'' in its offer for Warner.
   It said that by agreeing to the deal with Warner, Time ``is
forcing upon its shareholders a transaction whereby Time's
`integrity' and financial future will fall under the control of
Warner, whose executives in the recent past have been the subject of
criminal investigation, prosecution and in some cases conviction.''
   Among other things, Paramount cited the 1977 federal
investigation into the operations of the Westchester Premier
Theater. Two Warner executives pleaded guilty and a third was
convicted on charges in connection with Warner's purchase of shares
in the theater.
   Paramount noted that Warner Chairman Steven J. Ross was involved
in the investigation. Ross was never charged with wrongdoing in the
Premier Theater case, however.
   Time said Paramount's filing ``is an act of desperation full of
stale accusations that do nothing to clarify the real issues we
raised in our suit.''
   Ross said the Paramount filing was ``deliberately designed and
intended to distract from the principal issues at hand by
resurrecting old and entirely irrelevant points that have long since
been thoroughly aired both in public and the courts.''
   In a separate development, Time's 82 percent-owned American
Television and Communications Corp. said the city of Casselberry,
Fla., had filed suit in U.S. District Court in Florida asking that
Paramount be prohibited from taking ownership of its cable TV
franchise there without necessary approvals.
   ATC said it was the first such suit by a city in which ATC is
operating.
   A spokesman for Paramount said the company has no intention of
acquiring any cable franchise without state and local approvals.

   George and Barbara Bush were there. So was
William F. Buckley Jr., Bianca Jagger, Peter Jennings and Steve Jobs.
   The Wall Street Journal threw itself a gala 100th birthday party
Thursday night, filling the glass atrium outside its glitzy
headquarters with 600 luminaries.
   Though the guests ranged from chiefs of Fortune 500 companies to
media personalities, the real stars of the dinner-dance were the
president and his wife.
   ``The six columns of The Wall Street Journal are as familiar as
coffee at our morning breakfast tables,'' Bush told the black-tie
crowd that filled the sprawling Winter Garden atrium at lower
Manhattan's World Financial Center.
   ``If anything catastrophic happened in the Winter Garden, the
Fortune 500 would be lucky to keep in just double digits,'' Bush
quipped.
   The guest list read like a Who's Who of the business and media
worlds: computer whiz Jobs, Ford Motor Co. Chairman Donald Peterson,
ITT Corp. Chairman Rand Araskog, CBS Inc. Chairman Lawrence Tisch,
``60 Minutes'' anchor Mike Wallace, ABC anchor Jennings, and
Washington Post Co. Chairwoman Katharine Graham, among others.
   The entertainment agenda ranged from jazz great Lionel Hampton to
rocker Chuck Berry and blues singer Buster Poindexter.
   The guests also included 52 Journal readers _ one randomly
selected from each state _ and a reader each from Europe and Asia,
representing the paper's European and Asian editions.
   Rank-and-file Journal employees were not invited, but will have
39 picnics July 8 _ the actual date of the centennial _ at cities
across the country.
   In his remarks, Bush praised the financial daily as ``one of
America's most trusted publications.''
   ``A reputation like that can only be earned by adherence to your
founders' pledge to always have the news `honest, intelligent and
unprejudiced,'' Bush said.
   Bush also praised two Journal reporters, John Fialka and Alex
Kotlowitz, for organizing fund-raising efforts for needy people they
wrote about.
   Fialka, after writing in 1986 about the plight of poor retired
clergy, helped found an organization called SOAR _ Support Our Aging
Religious _ that has raised more than $1 million to aid 30 different
orders.
   Kotlowitz in 1987 chronicled the turbulent life in a gang-ridden
Chicago housing project of 12-year-old Lafayette Walton. Last
summer, Bush said, ``they passed the hat at the Journal and gave
Lafayette and his brother a season of peace in the woods of a
Wisconsin boy's camp.''
   ``These are the works of men and women who know that prosperity
without purpose means nothing,'' said Bush, who urged corporate
chieftains at the banquet to join the community service crusade Bush
announced earlier Thursday.

<HEAD>Former Trader Testifies About Stock Deals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERA HALLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials at Princeton-Newport Partners LP bought
and sold stock to generate tax losses and then instructed employees
on how to cover up the transactions, a former trader has testified.
   ``Princeton-Newport was parking securities to generate short-term
capital tax losses for the partners,'' William Hale said Thursday at
the racketeering trial of five Princeton-Newport officials and a
former trader at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Hale said the practice was widespread at the investment firm from
late 1984 until 1986 when he was fired.
   The government alleges that the defendants engaged in a
widespread tax fraud scheme through the securities transactions.
Neither of the firms is on trial.
   Hale's testimony focused on Paul Berkman, a Princeton-Newport
partner who was his immediate boss. He said Berkman instructed him
on ways to cover up the parking of securities.
   ``Berkman told me on buybacks to break them up to camouflage the
buybacks in case of audit,'' said Hale, who worked in the trading
room at Princeton, N.J. The company also had offices in Newport
Beach, Calif.
   Hale said he was told to change the price when buying back the
securities. ``Raise some, lower some to make it equal out,'' he said.
   ``Berkman said the IRS did not have the manpower to look over the
thousands of transactions at Princeton-Newport and see a pattern or
to figure out what was happening,'' Hale testified.
   He was asked by Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Hansen whether
others spoke to him about the parking of securities.
   ``Just about everyone,'' he said and named four other defendants:
traders Jack Z. Rabinowitz and Charles M Zarzecki; Princeton-Newport
comptroller Steven B. Smotorick; and former Drexel trader Bruce Lee
Newberg.
   The sixth defendant is James Sutton Regan, a Princeton-Newport
managing partner.
   The case overlaps with the government's indictment of former
Drexel financier Michael Milken, who headed the firm's junk bond
department.
   Hale said officials of Princeton-Newport had arrangements to park
securities at Drexel, Merrill Lynch and Akroyd &amp; Smithers Securities
Inc. No employees from Merrill Lynch or Akroyd &amp; Smithers have been
charged in the case.
   He also testified that he wrote down all the parking transactions
on a piece of paper which he kept on his desk for other workers to
see. Hale said he and the other employees called the list ``the
parking lot.''

<TEXT>
   Here is a chronology of key dates and
developments in the 100-year history of The Wall Street Journal, as
supplied by the newspaper:
   1882 _ Charles H. Dow and Edward D. Jones, two newspapermen from
New England, form a financial news agency in New York. They are
joined by a third partner, Charles Bergstresser, who is persuaded to
become a ``silent partner'' because Dow Jones &amp; Bergstresser didn't
sound right.
   1883 _ Dow Jones &amp; Co. begins publishing The Customers' Afternoon
Letter, a precursor to The Wall Street Journal.
   July 8, 1889 _ The first edition of The Wall Street Journal, a
four-page afternoon newspaper selling for two cents a copy, is
published. Charles Dow is the first editor and the paper features
his innovative ``average'' of 11 stocks.
   1898 _ A morning Journal edition is added. Circulation will
exceed 10,000 by the end of the century.
   1902 _ Clarence W. Barron, a financial journalist and publisher,
purchases Dow Jones &amp; Co.
   1929 _ Twenty-year-old Bernard Kilgore is hired as a Journal copy
editor. He goes on to become a reporter, Washington correspondent,
political columnist, managing editor, general manager, president of
Dow Jones at age 36, and later chairman. Kilgore is considered
responsible for transforming the Journal from a small financial
newspaper into the country's first national daily.
   1929 _ The Journal's Pacific Coast edition begins publication in
San Francisco and Los Angeles, a week before the stock market crash.
In the ensuing Depression, the Journal's circulation slips from
50,000 to 28,000.
   1934 _ The evening edition is discontinued.
   1941 _ Kilgore is named managing editor. He shapes the paper's
present-day approach that business news should go beyond financial
information to cover everything related to earning a living,
including trends and issues that shape society.
   Dec. 8, 1941 _ The day after Japan bombs Pearl Harbor, the paper
runs its first and only page-wide banner, three-deck headline and
reports extensively on how the ensuing war would affect American
industry.
   1947 _ Journal circulation reaches 100,000. Warren H. Phillips,
current chairman of Dow Jones, is hired as a copyreader.
   1948 _ Southwest edition is established.
   1951 _ Midwest edition is established.
   1953 _ The Journal's Saturday paper is discontinued. The same
year the Journal introduces its Electro-Typesetter, allowing typeset
stories to be sent over telephone lines to Journal plants in Dallas,
Chicago and San Francisco, eliminating retypesetting at the
satellite plants.
   1962 _ The Journal plant in Riverside, Calif., produces the
nation's first regularly and commercially printed facsimile
newspaper, using a microwave transmission from the San Francisco
plant.
   1966 _ Paid circulation surpasses 1 million.
   1974 _ A page of the Journal is transmitted from a makeshift
earth station in Chicopee, Mass., to South Brunswick, N.J., via a
satellite, a first for any U.S. newspaper. Also that year, selected
Journal stories are published electronically by Dow Jones
News-Retrieval.
   1975 _ An entire issue of the Journal sent by satellite to
Orlando, Fla., from Chicopee. The Journal's Orlando plant is the
world's first to operate exclusively via a satellite link.
   1976 _ The Asian Wall Street Journal is established in Hong Kong.
   1980 _ The Journal begins publishing in two sections.
   1981 _ Circulation surpasses 2 million.
   1983 _ The Wall Street Journal-Europe is established.
   1988 _ The Journal begins publishing in three sections.

<HEAD>Say GE, Ford Will Develop Arc Lights for Cars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM S. BERGSTROM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Electric Co. and Ford Motor Co. are trying
to make night driving as brightly lit as a night baseball game.
   The companies said Thursday they've joined in a venture to
develop arc discharge lamps for cars, like those in street and
stadium lights. GE officials said the lamps would blaze with a
whiter light, use less electricity and take more abuse than halogen
lights on most cars now.
   ``Assuming that the product that we jointly design is attractive
to the market and can be manufactured at a competitive price, then
there would be the opportunity for manufacturing and marketing it,''
said Bill Peacock, spokesman for Ford's diversified products
operation.
   The lights could appear on cars in the early 1990s, said Tom
Willis, general manager of the project for General Electric's GE
Lighting division in Cleveland. The companies didn't say how much
they would spend on the development program.
   Stadium lights need warmup time, but GE has developed an
instant-on version adaptable to cars, spokesman John Betchkal said.
   GE officials estimate the worldwide market for auto lighting
systems at $1 billion a year, although the GE-Ford system isn't
likely to be the only contender for the business.
   ``It's a very competitive arena, and there are other people
undoubtedly working on similar kinds of products,'' Peacock said.
   General Motors Corp.'s Fisher Guide Division in Anderson, Ind.,
has been working with North American Philips Corp. for more than
four years on a high-intensity discharge lighting system, Fisher
Guide spokesman Robert B. Quinn said.
   ``I'm sure we are exploring the new technologies,'' Chrysler
Corp. spokesman Ben Dunn added.
   The U.S. Department of Transportation has been easing
restrictions on headlights, recently legalizing 3-by-3-inch and
2-by-3{-inch versions, said Mike Henderson, spokesman for Corning
Inc., which supplies lenses and reflectors for various companies'
experimental lights.
   ``It's created a smorgasbord of opportunity for auto design
stylists,'' Henderson said.
   The arc discharge system burns cooler than halogen or
incandescent lamps, allowing use of smaller lenses that also can be
made of plastic, Willis said.
   Arc lights don't have filaments like halogen or incandescent
lights and thus are less delicate, Betchkal said, adding, ``We
expect the system to last the life of the car.''
   Replacement in case of an accident is expected to cost more than
for some current halogen systems but less than for others, he said.

<HEAD>Computer Giant Already Making Highly Advanced Chips</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   IBM Corp. says it's already producing an advanced
component deemed crucial to future electronic products, a disclosure
that suggested the computer giant has an unexpected edge over Japan.
   IBM President Jack D. Kuehler was quoted in today's editions of
The New York Times as saying the company is producing a four-megabit
memory chip ``in volume'' _ an industry expression that generally
means in sufficient quantities for commercial application.
   That would put International Business Machines several months
ahead in the race to mass-produce this type of dynamic random access
memory chip, or DRAM.
   Kuehler did not return telephone messages left on his home phone
for comment on the Times article, but IBM spokesman Peter Judice
told The Associated Press Thursday night: ``I can confirm we are
producing four-megabit chips in volume.''
   IBM's disclosure was considered significant not only because the
world's biggest computer company historically has avoided giving
away secrets, but because it came one day after U.S. computer makers
announced a joint venture to challenge's Japan's perceived supremacy
in making the chip.
   IBM and six other companies said they would form the first U.S.
consortium to build memory chips. The consortium, known as U.S.
Memories Inc., expects to mass-produce the chip starting in a few
years.
   IBM has suggested in the past that it has a strong interest in a
solid U.S. chip-producing industry. That partly explains why the
company is willing to share its technology with the consortium,
computer industry executives say.
   It had been widely assumed Japan was leading in the battle to
gain early dominance in production of the four-megabit chip, an
electronics component that can store 4 million bits of information,
or four times as much as any previous chip. The four-megabit chip is
considered a vital element of virtually all of the advanced
consumer-product and defense technology of tomorrow.
   Gordon Moore, chairman of U.S. Memories, said the consortium will
use IBM's advances in four-megabit chips to ``have the jump-start
needed to quickly come on line as a serious player.''
   The other companies announcing the consortium were: Advanced
Micro Devices Inc., Digital Equipment Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co.,
Intel Corp., LSI Logic Corp. and National Semiconductor Corp.
   If approved, the venture would break new ground in the federal
government's attitude toward cooperation between competing
companies. The government has been steadily more permissive toward
deals that once would have run afoul of antitrust laws on the theory
that concerted action is necessary to meet foreign competition.

<HEAD>House Minority Whip Asks Skinner to Enter Eastern Bankruptcy Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two congressmen asked Transportation Secretary
Samuel Skinner to enter the Eastern Airlines bankruptcy case out of
``urgent'' concern that the carrier's restructuring could lessen
airline competition.
   In a letter Wednesday to Skinner, House Republican Whip Newt
Gingrich of Georgia and Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., expressed
concern that antitrust issues have not been addressed adequately in
the Eastern bankruptcy proceedings.
   The letter also stated the two were worried that the plan by
Eastern parent Texas Air Corp. to rebuild the airline as a smaller
carrier and sell $1.8 billion in assets could reduce Eastern's
competitiveness.
   ``Our concern is urgent because it appears likely that Eastern
Airlines will be sold off in pieces, resulting in less than a fully
integrated competitive carrier,'' Gingrich and Campbell wrote
Skinner.
   A copy of the letter was obtained by The Associated Press.
   On Thursday, U.S. Rep. Glenn Anderson, chairman of the aviation
subcommittee of the House Public Works and Transportation Committee,
announced that his panel will hold a hearing next week on Eastern's
condition and ``the prospects for its restoration as a major
carrier.''
   Gingrich and Campbell said they especially were concerned that
Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo had an interest in not building up
Eastern as a competitor to Continental Airlines, Texas Air's other
main subsidiary.
   ``We are troubled that Mr. Lorenzo has more than one interest as
he offers the piecemeal sale of Eastern, and no party before the
bankruptcy judge represents the antitrust interest of the United
States,'' the letter read.
   ``We respectfully request that you make this decision quickly, as
the assets of Eastern are so rapidly being depleted that its
viability as a competitor on any routes may soon be in question.''
   Skinner hasn't responded to the letter, DOT spokesman Hal Paris
said Thursday.
   Miami-based Eastern has been under bankruptcy protection from
creditors since March 9, five days after the Machinists union struck
the carrier and was joined in the crippling walkout by pilots and
flight attendants.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland so far has allowed
Eastern to sell its Northeast shuttle service to developer Donald
Trump for $365 million. He also has approved Eastern's $277.5
million sale of 15 planes and six engines to an aircraft leasing
company.
   On Thursday, Eastern announced a deal to sell the last three
planes of its Boeing 727-100 fleet for $9 million to Express One, an
aircraft company based in Dallas. The proposed sale still must be
approved by Lifland.
   Eastern also has reached agreement to sell its eight Philadelphia
gates, 16 jets and other assets to Midway Airlines for $206.5
million. Skinner also has not approved that deal.
   Under Skinner, the Department of Transportation recently has
taken several steps to discourage actions it sees as possibly
inhibiting competition in the deregulated airline industry. For
example, he has warned 28 U.S. airlines that he would stop the
buying and selling of international routes when it affects
competition.

   The U.S. dollar sank lower this morning in nervous
European trading.
   Gold prices also drifted downward.
   European dealers said the currency market had not recovered its
equilibrium following a volatile swing late Thursday. The dollar
dived after a false rumor that President Bush had been shot.
   ``Everyone is very, very nervous today,'' said a trader at a
large bank in Frankfurt, West Germany. ``People are not sure about
anything. I think it will be either very volatile today, or nothing
will happen.''
   ``We're certainly not going to see the dollar up over 2.0 marks
in the short term. For the moment it needs to find a new base level
before it can move back up again,'' said a trader in Milan, Italy.
   ``We're not going to see much buying today, and those selling are
mostly cleaning up positions,'' said another dealer in Milan.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to 140.35 Japanese yen, down 1.05 yen
from Thursday. Later in London, the dollar traded at 139.94 yen.
   Other dollar rates in Europe, compared with Thursday's late
rates, included: 1.9520 West German marks, down from 1.9590; 1.6825
Swiss francs, down from 1.6860; 6.6250 French francs, down from
6.6325; 2.2058 Dutch guilders, up from 2.2005; 1,418.00 Italian
lire, down from 1,418.50; and 1.1912 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1925.
   The British pound cost $1.5565, compared to late Thursday's

   Orders for ``big ticket'' durable goods plunged
4.2 percent in May, the steepest drop in 10 months, the government
said today, raising fears that if the decline persists factory
workers will lose their jobs.
   Durable goods include a wide range of items, from washing
machines to warships, expected to last three or more years.
Economists closely track the orders as a measure of the health of
the industrial sector and of the impact of interest rates on the
economy. Persistent weakness is liable to lead to layoffs at
manufacturing plants.
   The plunge in May ``means fewer people will be needed to make
things, whether its planes or cars or washing machines,'' said
economist Cynthia Latta of Data Resources Inc. in Lexington, Mass.
   However, analysts were less alarmed by the May report than they
would normally have been because orders had surged in April and
because May was heavily influenced by a sharp decline in orders for
aircraft and parts that still left that category at strong levels.
   The Commerce Department said orders for durable goods fell to a
seasonally adjusted $124.0 billion after climbing a revised 3.2
percent in April and 1.0 percent in March. The April increase had
previously been estimated at 3.0 percent.
   Excluding the volatile transportation sector, which swings widely
from month to month, orders fell 2.1 percent in May, rose 4.5
percent in April and climbed 2.6 percent in March.
   Analysts generally agree that the economy is slowing this year,
but there is considerable controversy over whether the growth will
continue, albeit sluggishly, or whether the country will topple into
a recession.
   A variety of other government reports also indicate that the
economy is slowing in response to the Federal Reserve's year-long
campaign to fight inflation with higher interest rates. Recently, in
apparent reaction to the reports, the Fed permitted interest rates
to drop slightly.
   Durable-goods orders now have fallen in three out of the last
five months and their level remains $5.9 billion below the high of
$132.1 billion in December.
   ``It doesn't resolve the issue, but I think these negative
numbers certainly raise the specter of recession in peoples' eyes
and make them much more attuned to the possibility than before,''
Ms. Latta of Data Resources said.
   Although transportation orders in May showed the steepest drop,
9.4 percent, orders were weak in the other sectors as well.
   Primary metals, including steel, dropped 1.5 percent; electrical
machinery was down 4.5 percent and non-electrical machinery fell 3.4
percent.
   Orders for military goods, which also are very volatile, dropped
8.6 percent in May following a 18.2 percent plunge in April.
   Orders for non-defense capital goods, considered a good barometer
of business plans to expand and modernize, fell 8.3 percent in May
after rising 5.8 percent a month earlier. It was the biggest decline
since September.
   Shipments of durable goods also fell last month, edging down 0.1
percent to $123.3 billion. Shipments had risen 2.4 percent in April.

<HEAD>Wasserstein Perella Raises Bid for British Retailer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group led by U.S. financiers Wasserstein Perella
&amp; Co. sweetened its offer for Gateway Corp. PLC to $3.29 billion
Friday after an increase in its bid a day earlier failed to draw
significant support from the British retailer's shareholders.
   The new offer, at $3.69, or 237 pence, a share, tops the $3.66,
offered Thursday. With 890 million Gateway shares outstanding, the
bid values the company at a total of $3.29 billion.
   A rival bidder, Isosceles PLC, is offering $3.59 a share or a
total of $3.19 billion.
   The Wasserstein Perella group, which includes the Great Atlantic
&amp; Pacific Tea Co., is trying to rescue Britain's third largest food
retailer from its two-month old takeover fight against Isosceles.
   However, the Wasserstein Perella group had succeeded in gaining
control of only 3.3 percent of Gateway shares by the close of
trading Thursday.
   Isosceles, backed by a number of Gateway shareholders and
managers, said early Friday it owns or has received acceptances for
44.9 percent of Gateway shares.
   Wasserstein Perella and A&amp;P have indicated that if their takeover
succeeds they would keep much of Gateway intact, except for its
Herman's sporting goods chain in the United States, which would be
sold. Gateway controls about 11.4 percent of the $54.57 billion
British grocery market.
   Isosceles planned a more radical reorganization and intended to
sell off Gateway food stores.

<HEAD>United States Announces Change in Import Taxes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States has said it will introduce new
legislation to reduce the tax on petroleum imports and lift a
controversial customs surcharge, a spokesman for the organization
which sets world trade rules said Friday.
   Investigation panels of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade ruled more than a year ago that the so-called tax and the
customs user fee violated international trade law.
   U.S. deputy trade representative Rufus Yerxa told negotiators at
a GATT council meeting that legislation was before the U.S. Congress
to equalize treatment of imported and locally produced petroleum,
the GATT spokesman said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   This would amend a 1986 law which imposed a tax of 8.2 U.S. cents
on domestically produced petroleum and 11.7 cents on imported
petroleum, prompting complaints from Canada, Mexico and the European
Economic Community.
   Proceeds from the tax were intended for a ``superfund'' to
finance a harzardous waste cleanup program.
   Yerxa also said the United States would modify a surcharge levied
to cover import processing costs, according to the spokesman who was
at the closed meeting that ended late Thursday night.
   A GATT panel in 1987 backed a complaint by the European Economic
Community and Canada that the customs user fee of 0.17 percent of
the value of the basic product was a trade barrier because it earned
the United States more revenue than the real cost of import
processing.
   The GATT council meeting also agreed to give South Korea more
time to consider the findings of new panel reports against its
restrictions on beef imports, the GATT spokesman said.
   In separate complaints raised by the United States, Australia and
New Zealand, the investigation panels ruled at the end of April the
restrictions on imports were not justified on balance of payment
grounds.
   Under the rules of the 96-nation trade organization, less
developed countries are allowed to keep import restrictions to
protect their balance of payments.

<HEAD>Electricity Needs Become a Powerful Investment Issue</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Talk of looming power shortages and brownouts
around the country has many people worrying about the problems those
circumstances might cause.
   But some financial analysts and stock-market investors also are
looking into who might stand to benefit, acting on the time-honored
Wall Street precept that every crisis contains an opportunity.
   The electric power situation hasn't yet reached crisis
proportions. But as the Merrill Lynch Market Letter observes in a
special report on the subject:
   ``Supplies of electricity are gradually tightening in many
regions, especially in New England, on New York's Long Island and in
some mid-Atlantic states.
   ``The problem reflects unexpectedly strong demand in recent
years, operating difficulties that have forced some generating
stations out of service and the reluctance of some local governments
to allow completed plants to operate.''
   A team of analysts at IDS Financial Services, the big
Minneapolis-based money management firm, asserts, ``The United
States faces the very real threat of a substantial shortage of
electricity, on a national scale, by the mid-1990s.''
   In most industries, an investor's response to such a forecast
would be simple _ buy stocks of companies that own and produce the
commodity or product in question.
   But electric utilities are a special case, since they lack the
ability to set their prices simply on the basis of supply-and-demand
market forces. The rates they can charge are set by state regulators.
   ``It's unlikely that many utilities will benefit substantially
from higher sales of electricity. Regulatory authorities often make
it difficult for companies to keep extra profits,'' says Merrill
Lynch.
   Any gain in revenues and profits, IDS says, is likely to occur at
a utility that has a large ``reserve margin'' _ capacity to provide
extra power at periods of peak demand. Utilities with tight reserve
margins would be in a losing, rather than winning, position.
   Analysts say the story could be different, however, for other
businesses that serve the electric utility industry in a variety of
ways.
   ``The solution to the problem of insufficient power-generating
capacity clearly is to build new power plants and transmission
facilities,'' Merrill Lynch says.
   ``Many utilities have begun to do just that. Some utilities are
turning increasingly to comparatively small, gas-fired generating
stations that can be put into service relatively quickly.''
   By IDS's reckoning, ``if only half of the new power-plant
capacity is gas fired, electric utility demand for natural gas will
be 60 percent higher than it was in 1988.''
   Overall capital spending by the electric power industry, in
decline since the early 1980s, is predicted to begin increasing in
the years just ahead.
   ``That suggests that companies in a number of fields _ including
engineering and construction, machinery and electrical equipment _
stand to benefit in the not-too-distant future,'' Merrill Lynch says.
   ``Further out, suppliers of fuel such as natural gas and
low-sulfur coal could benefit once new or expanded power plants are
in operation.''
   A special hazard in the search for companies that will prosper
serving the power industry arises from the complicated
environmental, scientific and political questions involved.
   Nevertheless, even assuming a recession or two and no dramatic
increase in demand for energy, IDS analysts reckon that ``twice as
much additional power-plant capacity will be needed by the year 2000
as the electric industry currently estimates.''

<HEAD>Judges OKs Tyson Purchase Deal For Holly, Tyson Lawyer Says</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout with Judge approving tentative agreement.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Delaware judge approved today a tentative
agreement allowing Tyson Foods Inc. to buy Holly Farms Corp. for
$1.4 billion, a lawyer for Tyson said.
   The agreement, filed by lawyers for Tyson, Holly Farms and
ConAgra Inc., requires approval of the Holly Farms board of
directors, which is meeting in New York today, said Jim Blair, chief
legal counsel for Tyson.
   ``It sets the stage for a three-party settlement. I'm cautiously
optimistic,'' Blair said.
   Blair said the proposed agreement requires Tyson to pay ConAgra
$50 million to withdraw from the bidding for Holly Farms. The buyout
will cost Tyson about $1.4 billion, Blair said.
   Tyson has been trying to buy Memphis-based Holly Farms since
October while Holly Farms has been trying since November to merge
with ConAgra, based in Omaha, Neb.
   The Springdale, Ark.-based Tyson raised its tender offer for
Holly Farms stock to $70 a share Tuesday, and on Thursday, Holly
Farms directors announced they had begun new talks with Tyson and
ConAgra.
   ``The transaction being discussed would involve termination of
the Holly Farms merger agreement with ConAgra, settlement of all
litigation between the parties and an acquisition of Holly Farms
Corp. by Tyson Foods at $70 per share in cash,'' a Holly Farms
statement said.
   Directors of Holly Farms had rejected Tyson's previous offers and
announced two merger attempts with ConAgra. Holly Farms shareholders
rejected the first attempt in April, and Holly Farms announced the
second one in May.
   The latest merger proposal would have been accomplished through a
stock swap worth about $68 a share to Holly Farms shareholders.
Stockholders of the two companies had been expected to vote on that
proposal next month.
   Tyson began the bidding for Holly Farms last October with a cash
and stock-swap proposal worth $49.50 to Holly shareholders.
   Tyson has filed suit in Delaware _ where Holly Farms is
incorporated _ accusing the Memphis-based company of wrongly
favoring ConAgra at Tyson's expense. Tyson has asked for $500
million in damages.
   John McMillin, a market analyst for Prudential-Bache in New York,
said Tyson's decision to raise its offer from $63.50 to $70 may have
made the difference in the takeover attempt.
   ``It's been a difficult courtship between Tyson Foods and Holly
Farms, but I think they're going to get married,'' McMillin said.
   Tyson Foods processes more than 16.5 million chickens a week,
while Holly Farms is a diversified company heavily involved in fresh
fryer sales. ConAgra is a diversified company specializing in food
and agricultural services.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were slightly
higher in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade
following reports of lighter-than-expected rainfall overnight in the
western Corn Belt.
   The light buying followed a steep sell-off of corn and soybean
futures Thursday on expectations that the fairly heavy showers that
hit western Iowa on Wednesday night and Thursday would spread
undiminished across the Midwest.
   The soybean market saw some additional buying on worries that the
international marketplace is beginning to feel the pinch of a
producer-led disruption of soybean business in Brazil, the world's
second-largest soybean source.
   ``Some of the processors are saying they may have to declare
force majeur on some shipments,'' meaning they cannot meet their
commitments, said Dale Gustafson, a grain market analyst in Chicago
with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Brazilian soybean producers halted sales of soybeans and began
blocking soybean traffic about two weeks ago in a bid to push their
government toward economic reforms.
   In early trading, wheat was { cent lower to 1 cent higher with
the contract for delivery in July at $3.99} a bushel; corn was }
cent to 1{ cents higher with July at $2.62{ a bushel; oats were \
cent to 1 cent higher with July at $1.58 a bushel; soybeans were 5
cents to 7\ cents higher with July at $7.30 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were modestly lower while pork futures were
slightly higher in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .12 cent to .40 cent lower with August at 69.85
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .12 cent to .28 cent lower with
August at 81.02 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent to .35 cent
higher with July at 49.55 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.03 cent to .23 cent higher with July at 33.90 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mixed on Thursday.

<TEXT>
   T. Boone Pickens Jr., veteran of notorious but
unsuccessful takeover attempts in the United States, says there's
nothing hostile about his investment in a Japanese autoparts maker.
   ``Basically, I'm trying to make money,'' the Texas oilman says.
   But as far as Koito Manufacturing Co. is concerned, this
``nottoriya'' _ takeover monger _ has taken his corporate raiding
operations overseas.
   It is hard to tell who is right. But Pickens' latest venture into
corporate confrontation may actually be part of a larger agenda, one
in which he's taking on the entire Japanese way of doing business.
   Pickens and Koito management will face each other Thursday as
Koito convenes its annual meeting in Tokyo. They've been bickering
in the press since early April, when Pickens' privately held Boone
Co. became Koito's biggest shareholder by purchasing 20.2 percent of
the manufacturer's stock.
   Pickens' major gripe so far has been Koito's refusal to give
Boone Co. two seats on the company's board although the
manufacturer's second-largest shareholder, Toyota Motor Corp. _
which is seen as the real power behind Koito _ has placed three
directors there.
   Koito management already has said it won't address that issue at
the meeting. But Pickens expects a showdown with Koito anyhow,
because he wants to bring four people to the meeting, and management
has told him he can send just one representative and an interpreter.
   Sidney Tassin, a partner in Boone Co., says Pickens may be
temporarily hamstrung by Japanese law, which restricts shareholder
rights until a company's stock has been held by an owner for six
months.
   Tassin indicated in an interview that when the six months are up
_ and Boone Co. has rights including the ability to call special
meetings and to see some of Koito's financial information _ Pickens
may be able to move more freely.
   ``That may prove to be the first little test,'' Tassin said of
the dispute over Boone Co.'s representatives at the meeting.
   Pickens is taking on _ and irritating _ Koito's management in a
way that harkens back to his past challenges to U.S. companies,
including Phillips Petroleum Co., Unocal Corp. and Gulf Corp.
   The fact that Boone Co. acquired its stake from a well-known
Japanese raider, Kitaro Watanabe, has only served to heighten the
suspicion of Koito managers. In late April, the company demanded
Pickens prove that he _ and not Watanabe _ was the true owner of the
stake.
   Koito evidently believes Pickens bought the shares hoping to
drive up their price and force Koito to buy them back at a premium
above the market rate _ a practice known as greenmail.
   Pickens denied in an interview that he's ever been a corporate
raider, and said he isn't one now. He said he won't try to take over
Koito because it wouldn't be feasible for him to try to operate a
company in Japan.
   ``There's nothing hostile about the Koito deal; we just made an
investment,'' he said.
   But his record is what makes Koito wary.
   Pickens, through his Mesa Limited Partnership _ and its
predecessor, Mesa Petroleum Co. _ made millions of dollars from
unsuccessful attempts on U.S. companies. Some of his critics argued
that Pickens only went after Phillips, Gulf and other companies to
profit from his stock holdings, which the firms usually bought back
from Mesa.
   His association with Watanabe, who tried unsuccessfully last year
to force Koito to buy back his stake at a premium, also cast doubt
on Pickens' motives.
   Some observers in the Japanese press speculated Pickens might
have an agreement to sell back his shares to Watanabe so that both
the Japanese businessman and Boone Co. would profit.
   In his fight with Koito, Pickens _ who is considering running for
governor of Texas _ is continuing a campaign waged through takeover
battles and the advocacy group he founded, United Shareholders
Association: a campaign to enforce what he calls shareholder rights
and make management accountable.
   But on a larger scale, Pickens said, he's trying to force the
Japanese to open their markets, which many foreigners complain are
now virtually closed to American investors.
   ``It's extremely difficult to get a large participation or
interest in a Japanese company,'' he said, explaining that Koito was
the only company in which he could obtain a large stake.
   ``They can't just play a one-way street _ that's just not the way
life is,'' Pickens said. ``They're going to be forced to open up or
they're going to be forced to pull out.''
   Pickens said he can't stop American investors and companies from
selling their assets to the Japanese. But he said support is growing
among Americans and in Washington for legislation that would force
the Japanese to relax their attitudes on foreign investment.
   ``We may play a small part in this overall situation,'' he said.

<HEAD>Schering-Plough Selling Cosmetics Companies to Unilever</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADISON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Schering-Plough Corp. announced Friday the
sale of its cosmetics companies in Britain and West Germany to
Unilever NV for about $120 million.
   Schering-Plough announced its intention to sell Rimmel
International Ltd., of London, and Chicogo GmbH, of Dusseldorf, in
April. The two cosmetics companies, which employ 715 people, had
sales last year of about $75 million, according to a written
statement from Schering-Plough and Unilever.
   The sale does not affect Schering-Plough's Maybelline North
America cosmetics business.
   The agreement needs government approval and is expected to be
completed before January.
   Rimmel markets color cosmetics under such trademarks as Rimmel
and Sensiq. Chicogo's brand names are Chicogo and Ellocar.
   ``The purchase of the Rimmel and Chicogo businesses will
significantly enhance Unilever's position in the European color
cosmetics markets, lifting it to second place in value terms,'' said
Michael Perry, director of personal products operation for Unilever,
based in London and Rotterdam, Netherlands.
   Unilever makes consumer and packaged goods _ mainly foods,
detergents and personal care products _ and sells color cosmetics

<HEAD>Former Dayton Department Store Chairman Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Donald Dayton, former chairman of Dayton's
department stores, has died of cancer at the age of 74.
   Dayton, the eldest of five brothers who made Dayton's into a
retailing giant, underwent surgery for colon cancer last year and
was severely ill over the last six months, family members said. He
died Thursday.
   Dayton, a grandson of the firm's founder, began working at the
Dayton's store in 1937 as a clerk and stock boy. He moved through
the ranks as a buyer, divisional merchandising manager, general
superintendent, assistant general manager and general manager.
   In 1950, he became president and general manager on the death of
his father, George Nelson Dayton. In 1960, he was elected chief
executive officer, and became chairman in 1965.
   Dayton, along with his four brothers and a cousin, launched a
major expansion program for the downtown Minneapolis department
store founded in 1902 by their grandfather George D. Dayton.
   There was only one Dayton's store when Donald Dayton began
working for the company, but by time he resigned in 1968, Dayton
Corp., as it was then known, had grown to about 60 stores in 15
states and was the country's 14th largest retailer.
   Dayton Corp. merged in 1969 with J.L. Hudson Co., forming the
Dayton-Hudson Corp., which now has 660 stores in 38 states and is
the nation's fifth largest retailer.
   Dayton Hudson owns the Target discount store chain, Mervyn's
department store and Lechmere promotional discount store chain.
   Dayton, who suffered from polio as a child, founded the Sister
Kenny Institute, which did pioneering work in the rehabilitation of
polio victims and those with other severe disabling conditions.
   He resigned as chairman in July 1968, reportedly to lighten his
workload on the advice of his physician.

   The stock market staged a strong advance today,
bolstered by fresh evidence of a slowing economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 24.66 to 2,506.83
by noontime on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 861 up, 413
down and 535 unchanged.
   The Commerce Department reported this morning that new factory
orders for durable goods fell 4.2 percent in May. Wall Street had
been expecting them to be unchanged or slightly higher.
   Analysts saw the surprise decline as a sign that the economy
might be slowing more dramatically than previously forecast.
   That stirred some stepped-up talk of a possible business slump.
But brokers said it also raised expectations of falling interest
rates and reduced inflation.
   Optimists in the financial world argue that as evidence of a
weakening economy mounts, the Federal Reserve will relax its credit
policy to cushion the impact of the ``landing.''
   Gainers among the blue chips included American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph, up { at 36} on heavy volume; International Business
Machines, up 1[ at 110\; General Motors, up } at 41, and USX, up ]
at 36}.
   Prime Computer jumped 3 to 18~. The company, which has been
fighting a hostile takeover by MAI Basic Four Inc., agreed to be
acquired by the New York investment firm of J.H. Whitney &amp; Co.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.45 to 181.50. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 1.19 at 363.40.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 91.64 million shares at noontime,
up from 81.65 million at the same point Thursday.

<HEAD>Appetite for Vegas Real Estate Continues to Grow</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese investors, attracted by bargain
properties and a dramatic increase in tourism here by their
countrymen, have spent or committed $800 million in this
entertainment capital and it's fueling an economic boom.
   The projects range from four hotel-casinos to a downtown office
building and a massive golf course and resort development.
   More than 380,000 Japanese tourists are expected to visit Las
Vegas this year, vs. about 300,000 in 1988. That is not lost on some
of Japan's leading economic players.
   ``More than half the Japanese tourists who come to Los Angeles
will also come to Las Vegas,'' said Yoshi Morichika, who is heading
up a 1,274-acre golf and destination resort community for Japanese
recreation and electronics giant Cosmo World.
   The project, in nearby Henderson, will include 45 holes of golf,
2,700 condominiums, apartments and luxury homes, a dozen tennis
courts, a tennis stadium and a 700-room hotel.
   Cosmo World has projects in Japan, Europe, Hawaii, Los Angeles,
San Francisco and Tucson. It added Las Vegas to the list ``because
the land is not expensive, yet, and there is a huge volume of
Japanese tourists here,'' Morichika said in an interview.
   Jane Wilson, who handles international marketing for the Las
Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, says Japanese tourism has
been increasing at about 20 percent a year, and is expected to jump
about 27 percent this year.
   ``If they come to the West Coast, we're going to get them,'' she
said. ``In their culture, they want to go where a city is known
worldwide, where there are a lot of things to do such as shows,
shopping, sightseeing, et cetera.''
   The growing identity of Las Vegas in Japan, bargain real estate
prices, a good economic climate and the attractiveness of the city
are proving a magnet for Japanese investors. The Nevada Development
Authority says Las Vegas is the sixth-fastest growing metropolitan
area in the United States.
   Cosmo World's resort project is expected to cost $200 million by
the time it's completed in 1993.
   Japanese billionaire Masao Nangaku, who bought the Dunes Hotel
and Casino two years ago for $157 million, is planning a 35-story
high-rise office building and 300-room nongaming hotel in downtown
Las Vegas. The cost, when completed in 1991, will be about $120
million.
   A group of Japanese investors have agreed to help Orlando, Fla.
developer Bob Snow finance a $130 million dining and entertainment
complex known as Winchester Station. Snow is seeking a new site for
the project because some landowners in downtown Las Vegas balked at
selling their property.
   Japanese businessman Katsuki Manabe, who owns more than 30
arcades in Tokyo, has invested $30 million in the Park Hotel in
downtown Las Vegas and millions more in his Nevada-based Sigma
Games, a gaming equipment maker.
   Millionaire Ginji Yasuda has invested more than $120 million in
the Aladdin Hotel.
   The move by the Japanese into the sophisticated gaming industry
has not been smooth.
   Yasuda, a high-rolling gambler before he bought the Aladdin, has
experienced financial problems at the resort in recent months,
forcing him to dig for sources to pay back taxes and some suppliers.
   However, one top Nevada gaming source, who asked not to be
identified, said Yasuda's license was up for reconsideration earlier
this year and would not have been continued ``if he had not been
able to meet his gaming obligations.''
   The same source said the Japanese had taken over depressed
properties and kept them open ``and any stride forward is a positive
sign.''
   The Dunes and Aladdin had been operating under bankruptcy
protection for years before they were purchased by Nangaku and
Yasuda. The Park, the former Holiday Inn downtown, had been closed
for five years before it was refurbished and opened by Manabe.
   Mike Rumbolz, former Gaming Control Board chairman who now heads
Donald Trump's efforts to enter Nevada gaming, said the Japanese
were hampered because they bought distressed properties that
couldn't make it under American expertise.
   Sukeaki Izumi, who owns five hotels in Japan and Guam, recently
purchased another closed property, the former Treasury Hotel, which
he has renamed the San Remo. Izumi, who looked at properties in
Hawaii but opted for Las Vegas because of the lower costs, has
committed $30 million for the purchase and renovation of the hotel.
   Don Woodsmall, who serves with Morichika as project manager of
the Cosmo World project, said Las Vegas was picked by the Japanese
company, in part, ``because the housing market is so strong here.''
   Representatives of the company began looking for land in late
1987 and selected a site 10 minutes south of the Las Vegas Strip.
   Work on the Cosmo World project is scheduled to start in the
first quarter of 1990. Several major hotel chains have expressed an
interest in running the resort, Morichika said.
   Izumi, a millionaire industrialist, became involved in the hotel
business six years ago when he bought a property in Osaka.
   He switched his focus here, he said, because the city was
smaller, the cost of living was lower, real estate prices were more
attractive, and he liked the way of life.
   Izumi moved to Las Vegas in December and plans to run the San
Remo personally. The 324-room European-style property is scheduled
to reopen July 1. Izumi has plans for a $30 million 16-story,
340-room tower next year, followed by a second tower and expansion
of the casino.
   When Nangaku bought the Dunes Hotel two years ago, his attorney
predicted other Japanese businessmen would follow.
   They did.
   ``This area is very attractive to the Japanese businessman,''
Izumi said. ``There is no other city like Las Vegas in the world.''

<HEAD>More Dollars, Fewer Equities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An important but often ignored consequence of
mergers and takeovers in recent years has been a steady shrinkage in
the amount of corporate stock available for trading.
   It is just one of several important changes in the anatomy of the
stock market that make it a very different beast than that of two
decades ago.
   In just five years, from 1984 through 1988, a total of $369
billion of U.S. equities was removed from the trading arena, an
average of $74 billion a year, in contrast to the previous 15 years,
when the total rose at $9 billion a year.
   The figures, obtained from Wright Investors' Service, Bridgeport,
Conn., show the trend has significantly reduced the variety of
investment options and created a classic supply-demand imbalance
that has tended to push up prices.
   In Wright's opinion, the relative shortage of marketable equities
is an important prop under the current level of stock prices. Still,
it adds, that prop is not unshakeable, and it forecasts a price
decline later this year.
   Another fundamental change in the market has been the long
evolution from individual to institutional ownership.
   Wright's figures show that the enormous growth of pension and
mutual funds is not the sole reason for the dominance of
institutions. Simultaneously, it observes, individual activity has
been falling sharply.
   In fact, the Wright analysis shows individual investors cashed in
$500 billion of blue chip stocks during the five years from 1984
through 1988. In 1988 alone, it says, household stock holdings
shrank by $105 billion, and in the first quarter of 1989 the exodus
rose to an annual rate of $157 billion.
   For every sale there must be a buyer, of course, and in recent
years the buyers have been institutions. Recent patterns of activity
show, however, that unusual changes also have been occurring within
the institutional body.
   In the five years through 1988, for example, equity mutual funds
increased their holdings by $48 billion, but last year they returned
$16 billion to the market and they continued to be sellers right
through 1989's first quarter.
   According to Wright, the only major sector which has consistently
added to equity holdings of late is state and local government
retirement funds. In the five years through 1988, these funds were
net buyers of $108 billion of stocks.
   The reason why stocks in recent months seem to have fallen into
disfavor isn't at all clear, except for the likelihood that the
yield on bonds convinced some portfolio managers that bonds were the
better risk.
   That explanation, however, doesn't help at all in clarfiying why
portfolio managers for state and local government pension funds
found equities attractive while their counterparts in private-sector
funds were net sellers.
   Who, then, has been supporting the market? Wright concedes that
foreign investors were important buyers during the price runup of
the 1980s. But even foreigners were sellers in the months following
the late-1987 market crash.
   It isn't totally clear whether foreigners are still selling to
this day or whether they have, instead, reverted to their old buying
habits, but in the first quarter they unloaded $l.6 billion of U.S.
equities.
   While statistics such as these _ plenty of sellers but few buyers
_ suggest a mysterious source of support for the current level of
prices, there is one prop that is delineated clearly and precisely.
   It is this: A growing supply of money and a shrinking supply of
equities tend to exert an upward force on prices. Whether that force
is sufficient to maintain current price levels, however, is not
nearly so clear.

   Gov. Gaston Caperton today invited the
heads of the Pittston Co., the nation's largest coal exporter, and
the miners' union to the governor's mansion to resume negotiations
in a violent, 2{-month strike.
   ``Only two parties can end this strike _ Pittston and the United
Mine Workers,'' Caperton said at a breakfast meeting of the National
Coal Association convention at the Greenbrier resort in White
Sulphur Springs.
   He asked UMW President Richard Trumka and Paul Douglas, chairman
of the Pittston Co., to resume negotiations Monday. About 1,900 UMW
members have been on strike at Pittston Coal Group mines in
Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky since April 5 over wage and
benefit disputes.
   Pittston has declared an impasse in contract negotiations and has
begun implementing its own contract at its operations. Neither the
company nor the union immediately responded to the invitation.
   Wildcat walkouts in sympathy with the Pittston strike began last
week in West Virginia and have spread to nine other states to
include more than 43,000 miners.
   Company efforts to obtain authorities' help in getting wildcat
strikers back to work have met with mixed success.
   In Ohio today, about 100 miners returned to the Saginaw Mine near
St. Clairsville after the company filed a complaint with the
National Labor Relations Board.
   But in West Virginia, miners have defied several back-to-work
orders. This morning, U.S. District Judge Dennis Knapp met with
lawyers for 13 companies seeking back-to-work orders, but postponed
formal hearings on those requests and on five company motions that
the union and its officials and members be held in contempt of court
for ignoring his previous orders.
   A group of community leaders and state legislators planned to ask
Knapp to remove himself, claiming he is biased in favor of coal
companies.
   Knapp on Wednesday fined six UMW locals, their officers and
members and ordered U.S. marshals to serve pickets with copies of
his order. The fines will increase each day the locals, officers and
union members are in violation of the order.
   Striking miners in Kentucky this morning overturned a jeep driven
by a Pittston mine manager, one day after a strike sympathizer was
grazed by a bullet at a West Virginia mine.
   More than 200 strikers surrounded the Eastern Coal Corp. office
near Stone, Ky., this morning after rumors circulated that the
company's mine would resume operations Monday with replacement
workers. The workers who rolled a jeep onto its driver's side said
they were trying to turn back the mine manager. They later righted
the jeep and the man drove off; it was not immediately known if he
was injured.
   In Johnstown, Pa., roving pickets turned away about 600 United
Steelworkers members today at a Bethlehem Steel Corp. plant that
makes railroad coal cars, the company said.
   The pickets were not identified. They were presumed to be some of
the estimated 6,900 UMW members off the job in Pennsylvania.
   Virginia also appeared likely to become a focus of confrontation
as Pittston Coal Group President Michael Odom confirmed Thursday
that some salaried workers will be moved there from West Virginia,
where the strike has crippled mines. A union representative said the
West Virginia strikers would cross the state line to try to avert
any use of replacement workers.
   In U.S. District Court in Clarksburg, Judge William Kidd on
Thursday said he would rule soon on Consolidation Coal Co.'s
petition to force miners from six north-central West Virginia locals
to return to work.
   Back-to-work orders also are being sought by companies in Alabama
and Pennsylvania, and Consolidation has said it plans to seek
similar legal action in Illinois and Ohio.
   The estimated number of miners involved in unauthorized walkouts,
according to union and industry officials, are: West Virginia
16,000; Illinois, 8,000; Pennsylvania, 6,600; Alabama, 5,000; Ohio,
2,660; Kentucky, 2,325; Indiana, 1,750; Virginia, 755; Missouri,
350; and Tennessee, 200.

   The House today sent to President Bush an
emergency spending bill that averts the threatened disruption of
health care for veterans and other programs.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said ``we're very
pleased'' with the legislation and said Bush looked forward to
signing it.
   The $3.5 billion fiscal 1989 supplemental appropriations bill,
approved by the Senate Thursday night, passed the House 318-6.
   The emergency legislation was delayed for weeks, mostly because
of a battle over adding more money for anti-drug programs.
   In a compromise struck Thursday, House Democrats dropped their
plan to add $821 million for drug programs.
   The White House had threatened to veto the bill if the drug money
were included, saying federal agencies already had all the money
they could spend this year.
   The new version would add just $75 million for the anti-drug
effort, with that money coming from deferring spending on two other
programs until fiscal 1990. The revised bill was cleared in meetings
with White House budget director Richard Darman on Thursday.
   ``This could free up the logjam so the veterans programs and
other funding emergencies can get their money,'' said Sen. Robert C.
Byrd, D-W.Va., chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
   Byrd said he contributed to the compromise by halving the bill's
allocation for one of his pet projects, replacement of a $75 million
radio-telescope in his home state, delaying the rest of the money
for that project until next year. The rest of the money for the drug
programs would come from deferring some agriculture spending.
   On Wednesday, the House killed an earlier version of the bill
which was opposed by Republicans and conservative Democrats. Anxious
about leaving veterans' programs threatened over the Fourth of July
holiday, congressional leaders discussed a temporary bill to delay
final action until next month but the White House balked at further
delays.
   Under congressional rules, the bill is supposed to provide money
only for ``dire emergencies,'' but it actually covers a broad swath
of spending programs.
   The largest single item is $1.2 billion for the Department of
Veterans Affairs to cover a shortfall in money for medical care,
compensation and pensions, and in other areas.
   Thousands of veterans would be denied health care without the
extra funding this year, according to the administration.
   The bill would add nearly $900 million to the federal guaranteed
student loan program, $342 million to cover the cost of fighting
last year's widespread forest fires, and $423 million for foster
care and adoption.
   The food stamp program would be increased $225 million, aid to
the unemployed $90 million, and refugee assistance 100 million.

<HEAD>Stockholders Approve Operations Split</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Morton Thiokol Inc. stockholders Friday approved
splitting the company's operations, returning the Thiokol name to
its aerospace division and creating a new chemicals, airbags and
salt business named Morton International Inc.
   Ballots representing 76 percent of the company's 47.6 million
outstanding shares were cast in the election, with about 60 percent
of outstanding shares favoring the split and 15.4 percent opposed.
   ``We are pleased to have received stockholders' approval and plan
to move forward to complete the transaction,'' said Charles S.
Locke, chairman and chief executive officer of Morton Thiokol Inc.
   He said the split would take effect July 1.
   The new Thiokol Corp. will continue to operate under the existing
Morton Thiokol board of directors, with Morton Thiokol stockholders
receiving a share-for-share distribution of Morton International.
   Thiokol Corp. was the name of the missile company that was
acquired in 1982 by Morton Norwich. The merged company was called
Morton Thiokol Inc.
   Locke said the combined market values of the stock of the two
companies will equal or exceed the present value of Morton Thiokol
stock.
   Officials said Morton International will be headquartered in
Chicago _ current home of Morton Thiokol _ and will have $1.1
billion in annual sales and assets of $800 million. It will deal in
specialty chemicals, salt and inflatable restraint systems known as
airbags.
   Locke will be chairman and chief executive officer of Morton
International.
   The new Thiokol Corp. initially is to be headquartered in Ogden,
Utah, although other cities are under consideration, officials said.
   U. Edwin Garrison, president of Morton Thiokol's Aerospace Group,
was named in April to become president and chief executive officer
of the new Thiokol Corp. by Morton Thiokol's board.
   Thiokol will employ about 12,000 people, with about 8,000 people
at the Wasatch Operations west of Brigham City in northern Utah,
where space shuttle rocket motors and other strategic and tactical
missile systems are manufactured.
   After 2{ years redesigning the shuttle motor blamed for the 1986
explosion of the Challenger space shuttle, Morton Thiokol declined
to bid on the NASA contract for a new generation of boosters.
   Net sales in the aerospace division increased 14 percent in the
first nine months of fiscal 1989 to $871.5 million from $766.4
million.
   Company officials said Morton International would have annual
sales approaching $1.5 billion, with assets of $1.4 billion and more
than 8,000 employees.

   Senate Democrats today revised their child-care
bill to add a provision sought by the White House, but the
administration said the package remained unacceptable and was ``a
candidate for a veto'' by President Bush.
   An amendment, approved 54-45, added a third element to a
tax-credit package that already includes upfront money to help poor
families pay for child care and a new credit to help them pay for
children's health insurance.
   The new element, an expansion of the earned income tax credit for
low-income parents with children under age 5, was part of an
alternative Republican child-care package defeated Thursday.
   But Republicans scoffed at the compromise effort, led by Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
the gesture was not enough to sway the administration's opposition
to the bill, a revised version of the Act for Better Child Care,
known as ABC.
   ``The ABC bill in any combination is a candidate for a veto,''
said Fitzwater, who did not say outright that Bush would veto it.
   Bentsen, angered that Republicans would not accept his overture,
said the GOP was refusing to give ground.
   ``I offer this amendment in a spirit of compromise,'' he said.
``The president of the United States can't have it all.''
   Their attempt at compromise spurned, the Senate's majority
Democrats then moved to clear a long list of amendments in hopes of
forcing a final vote on the package later today. However, approval
of Bentsen's measure appeared likely to trigger lengthy debate on
the amendments, delaying the wrapup vote.
   Thursday's debate concluded just before midnight with Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine warning that a two-week
recess scheduled to begin today would be put on hold unless work on
the child-care plan is finished.
   Many of the GOP amendments adopted Thursdsay made no major
changes and were accepted by the sponsors of the legislation.
   Also winning approval were two amendments dealing with the
earnings limit faced by certain Social Security recipients. One
exempted all child-care related earnings from the cap; the other
raised the cap by $1,200 a year.
   With House action on child care just beginning, Senate Democrats
say their proposal will now likely serve as the framework for the
plan that ultimately clears Congress.
   Republicans said that with action still on hold in the House, the
Bush administration has time to seek further compromise.
   GOP lawmakers failed 56-44 in their attempt to kill the
Democratic plan in favor of a White House-backed approach keyed to
tax credits. The Senate then voted 63-37 to accept the broader
Democratic plan in principle, leaving the final vote until later.
   Republicans argued the Democrats' version would create new
bureaucracies and limit parental choice because the legislation
recommends that states adopt minimum standards for child care.
   ``Child care is a family issue,'' Senate Republican leader Bob
Dole of Kansas said. ``It's a family issue, not a government issue.''
   But the principal author of the measure, Sen. Christopher Dodd,
D-Conn., said some state regulation of child care is necessary.
   ``If your car and your pets are given certain protections by
state licensing agencies, we think your children deserve no less,''
Dodd said. He also disputed the GOP assertions about parental
choice, noting that 70 percent of the $1.75 billion in subsidies
authorized for fiscal 1990 would have to be paid to parents.
   In addition to the $1.75 billion subsidy authorization, the
Democrats' plan creates a new tax credit of up to $1,000 to help
low-income parents buy health insurance for their children. It also
would make refundable in advance 90 percent of the existing
dependent care tax credit, a step designed to provide cash to
low-income parents who otherwise cannot take advantage of the
credit. Bentsen said his revised tax-relief package still would cost
the government about $10.5 billion over five years.
   The defeated GOP plan also allowed poor families to get the
dependent care credit up front. Its other major element was the EITC
expansion.
   The amendment exempting child-care earnings from the Social
Security earnings cap was sponsored by Sen. William Roth, R-Del.
   The other, offered by Bentsen, increased the overall earnings
limit currently applied to Social Security recipients age 65 to 69.
They lose $1 in benefits for every $2 in outside income over $8,800.
The amendment would raise the earnings threshold to $10,560 and
lower the rate of benefits loss to $1 for every $4 earned.

   Stock prices fell Friday after an erratic trading
session dominated by worries that British interest rates are headed
higher.
   The Financial Times Stock Index 100 index closed down 12.5
points, or 0.57 percent, at 2,167.5. Volume was a moderate 490.3
million shares, down from 498.2 million Thursday.
   An early surge on Wall Street lifted London shares well above
midday lows before the close.
   But dealers said the market was concerned the volatility of the
British pound would provoke another rise in base lending rates above
the current 14 percent.
   Traders said the market would likely remain nervous before
Tuesday's release of May trade data.
   Afternoon trading was disrupted by a computer failure at the
stock exchange that halted calculation of market indexes several
hours.
   Though the exchange's trading system wasn't affected, dealers
said many participants were reluctant to trade ``blind,'' without a
firm idea of minute-by-minute market trends.

   The stock market rose sharply today in buying
encouraged by fresh evidence of a slowing economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 31.68 to 2,513.85
by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 963 up, 432
down and 511 unchanged.
   The Commerce Department reported this morning that new factory
orders for durable goods fell 4.2 percent in May. Wall Street had
been expecting them to be unchanged or slightly higher.
   Analysts saw the surprise decline as a sign that the economy
might be slowing more dramatically than previously forecast.
   That stirred some stepped-up talk of a possible business slump.
But brokers said it also raised expectations of falling interest
rates and reduced inflation.
   Optimists in the financial world argue that as evidence of a
weakening economy mounts, the Federal Reserve will relax its credit
policy to cushion the impact of the ``landing.''
   Gainers among the blue chips included American Telephone &amp;

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.92 to 181.97. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value

<HEAD>The Money For Your Next Mortgage May Come From Tokyo</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ever wonder where the money for your next house
will come from now that the local savings and loan has plywood over
its windows? Try Japan.
   Japanese money is starting to flow into the immense $2.4 trillion
residential mortgage loan market, one of the few U.S. investment
opportunities it has not yet touched.
   An invisible barrier to Japanese money broke this past week with
the announcement of a $575 million fund for foreigners, mainly
Japanese, to invest in mortgage-backed securities. It's called the
Blackstone Fund for Fannie Mae Mortgage Securities.
   Last year the average Fannie Mae-owned or -guaranteed loan was
less than $70,000, so the new fund is good for financing mortgages
on roughly 8,000 American homes. And that's just a start.
   ``We're confident these investors will have a very attractive
return, and that's only going to open the market for larger or more
numerous funds of this type,'' said Robert Nau Jr., a managing
director of Salomon Brothers Inc., which sold the fund in Japan.
   The idea of borrowing Japanese money to buy a home is bound to
stir anxiety in some quarters, but a closer look should quiet most
of the qualms:
   _First, decisions on loans _ and foreclosures, if it comes to
that _ are still made by local lenders, subject to state laws.
   _Second, the influx of a new source of money for loans should at
least slightly lower mortgage rates, so people can buy better houses
for the same amount of money.
   ``It's kind of tough because I think we're all a little
schizophrenic on those things. We like the old building and loan
idea from `It's a Wonderful Life,''' said Jayne Shontell, vice
president for mortgage-backed securities capital market transactions
at Fannie Mae.
   ``Still, all of us want the lowest possible rate on our mortgage.
Nostalgia is nice and, hey, I have antiques in my house, but the
typical consumer wants the best he can do financially, and that
means we have to enter the international market,'' she said.
   Money follows a convoluted path from Tokyo to the three-bedroom
on Maple Avenue. This is how it works:
   A home buyer gets a mortgage loan from the local savings and
loan. The S&amp;L doesn't want to or can't afford to keep the loan on
its books, so it sells it to Fannie Mae _ the Federal National
Mortgage Association.
   If Fannie Mae does not want to keep the loan on its own books, it
packages it with others in the form of a mortgage-backed security,
which trades on the open market.
   Blackstone Financial Management bought $575 million worth of the
securities. It is managing the new fund, while the Japanese
investors for it were recruited by Salomon and Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.
   Fannie Mae allowed its name to be used in the fund's title but is
not involved in the management.
   The homeowner's monthly mortgage payment goes from Maple Avenue
to the S&amp;L, which is now merely a ``servicer'' of the loan, to
Fannie Mae, to Blackstone, and finally across the Pacific.
   Each middleman skims off some of the money, but the yield is
still better than investors can get in Japan, the land of 2 percent
bank accounts.
   The deregulation of the financial markets that made the
Blackstone Fund possible had the unfortunate effect of forcing
hundreds of savings and loans to board up their windows or, more
often, disappear in shotgun weddings with healthier institutions.
   The S&amp;Ls were squeezed to death between the high rates they had
to pay for deposits and the low rates they were able to charge on
their mortgage loans. But their loss was _ is _ the consumers' gain.
   Before 1970 the average mortgage was 4 percentage points higher
in yield than the average 10-year Treasury note. That spread is down
to 2 percentage points now, and it may narrow further, said Laurence
Fink, chairman and chief executive of Blackstone Financial
Management.
   Eventually, Japanese money may become as essential to financing
American homes as it is to financing the U.S. budget deficit. And
that will go on as long as the United States as a whole remains a
borrowing nation.
   ``If it's the most aggressive way to help you afford the best
house you can afford, you're probably going to do it,'' Ms. Shontell
said.

<HEAD>Texaco To Redeem $966 Million In Debentures Ahead Of Maturity Dates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texaco Inc. said Friday it plans to
retire almost $1 billion in debt securities ahead of scheduled
maturity dates in a further effort to improve the company's
financial footing.
   Texaco earlier this year completed a major financial
restructuring, including the sale of $7 billion in assets, nearly a
year after emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.
   The company has said it would use proceeds from the asset sales
to reduce debt.
   The following three debt issues are scheduled to be redeemed on
Aug. 31:
   _$500 million of 13 percent notes due Aug. 1, 1991, issued by
Texaco Capital Inc., to be redeemed at par plus accrued interest.
   _$307 million of 11~ percent convertible subordinated debentures
due May 1, 1994, issued by Texaco Capital N.V., to be redeemed at
104 percent of the $1,000 face value plus accrued interest;
   _$159 million of 11} percent convertible subordinated debentures
due May 15, 1994, issued by Texaco Capital N.V., to be redeemed at
104 percent of the $1,000 face value plus accrued interest.
   Redemption of the $466 million in convertible subordinated
debentures represents the final amount outstanding of $1.5 billion
in those securities Texaco issued in 1984. Holders of the other
$1.034 billion of similar issues previously had converted them into
20.7 million shares of the company's stock, Texaco said.
   Early retirement of the corporate securities will further
strengthen Texaco's financial position and improve profitability and
shareholder value, said company President James W. Kinnear.
   As of the end of March 1989, Texaco, the third largest U.S. oil
company behind Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp., had reduced its debt to
$7.1 billion from $10.8 billion in April 1988. The company said
earlier this year that it hoped to cut it back to $6.5 billion by
the end of the year.
   Texaco did not say how much it would save through the early
retirement of the notes and bonds, but indicated the savings would
be ``pretty significant,'' given the high interest rates.
   ``This is what's behind it. This is high-cost debt,'' said
spokeswoman Anita Larsen.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Surge On Brazilian Supply Fears</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices closed with strong gains
Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid fears that a producer-led
halt to Brazilian soybean sales is beginning to squeeze supplies on
the world market.
   Wheat and oat futures retreated while corn was narrowly mixed.
   Brazilian soybean growers stopped selling their crops to
processors about two weeks ago to protest government economic
policies.
   Now rumors are spreading that some Brazilian soybean crushers
will be forced to delay shipments of soybean meal and oil to their
European trading partners.
   If those shipments are delayed, demand and prices for U.S.
soybeans are likely to rise.
   ``It is very much an uncertainty,'' said Cathy Leow, an assistant
vice president and grain-market analyst with Thomson McKinnon
Securities Inc. in New York.
   ``And because we don't have much stocks of old-crop beans in
Midwest, it's a very explosive situation for the nearby contracts,''
those for delivery in July and August.
   At the close, soybeans were 2 cents to 9{ cents higher with July
at $7.30 a bushel; wheat was unchanged to 2\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.97{ a bushel; corn was 3 cents
lower to { cent higher with July at $2.62\ a bushel; oats were 4\
cents to 4{ cents lower with July at $1.52{ a bushel.

<HEAD>Britain's Largest Brewer, Bass, Announces Restructure Plans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bass PLC, Britain's largest brewer, is to split its
pub and brewing operations into two divisions in an apparent
response to recent recommendations by antitrust authorities.
   Bass said Friday its new Inns and Taverns unit would be
responsible for the retail operation of Bass-managed pubs, together
with the administration of and sales to its tenanted pubs.
   Meanwhile, the Bass Brewers division will take charge of
wholesaling the company's different brands, a statement said.
   A Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on the brewing
industry has recommended no company with brewing interests should
own more than 2,000 pubs. The brewers are negotiating with Trade
Secretary Lord Young on the recommendations.
   If the main proposals are implemented, Bass will be better placed
to sell off either division if necessary, analysts say. The
restructuring, which the company says will give it the basis for
flexibility and continued growth, is to be implemented in October.

<HEAD>GAO Says Navy Improperly Restricted Competition on Computer Contract</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs graf 8 to add Navy no comment. Also moved on general news
wires.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy improperly restricted competition on a
$30 million computer contract by setting specifications that only
allowed International Business Machines Corp. to bid, says a
congressional watchdog agency.
   The General Accounting Office found that the service, in a rush
to meet a December 1988 deadline, violated federal regulations when
it specified IBM hardware and related equipment in soliciting for a
payroll computer system.
   The Competition in Contracting Act and the Federal Acquisition
Regulation require that procurement specifications state only the
government's actual needs and promote open competition.
   The GAO also found that the Navy received a system design that
did not meet its payroll needs.
   ``The Navy's efforts to acquire the necessary hardware and
software to support NAVSCIPS (the Navy Standard Civilian Pay System)
were not supported by sound technical decisions and did not promote
full and open competition,'' the GAO concluded.
   The agency, which called the Navy's approach ``shortsighted,''
recommended that the service cancel the contract with IBM, rewrite
the specifications and allow rebidding on the contract.
   ``It is difficult for us to accept the notion that the December
1988 deadline was so critical to the Navy's mission that it
precluded following federal regulations and accepted systems
development practices,'' the agency said.
   Lt. Greg Smith, a Navy spokesman, said the service would reserve
comment on the report until it saw a copy.
   The GAO found that the Navy chose a data base management system,
hardware and 10 sites for the system ``without conducting
appropriate studies and developing adequate support.''
   Last year, six computer companies complained to former Defense
Secretary Frank C. Carlucci that the Navy was favoring IBM on a
number of contracts.
   Rep. James J. Florio, D-N.J., chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce subcommittee on commerce, consumer protection and
competitiveness, requested the GAO report in December 1988.

   A tentative contract settlement between the
United Steelworkers and Inland Steel Co. offers nearly 12,000 union
members an immediate bonus of $500, $1.50 in base wage increases and
higher incentive pay.
   USW officials released the details of the four-year pact Friday.
   Handbills distributed at plant gates at Chicago Friday morning
said the offer includes the bonus and a 75 cent rise in base wages
on Aug. 1, the day the contract will take effect if ratified by the
rank-and-file.
   The next raise would come Jan. 1, 1991, when base wages would
increase by 50 cents and the incentive rate by 25 cents per hour.
   A year later, base wages would rise by 25 cents and the incentive
rate by 50 cents per hour, and on Jan. 1, 1993, the only increase
would be a 25 cent-per-hour boost in the incentive rate.
   The incentive system pays workers a portion, typically 35
percent, of the incentive rate. Most Inland workers are on incentive
pay. They will get the $1.50 base wage increase plus 35 cents of the
$1 hike in the incentive rate.
   In addition, Inland is offering to restore the one week of
vacation the workers gave up in the 1986 talks.
   Pensions will be improved so that the minimum payment for those
with 30 years' service will be $1,000.
   District 31 Director Jack Parton, who led the union negotiating
team, called the new pension plan the best in the steel industry.
   Inland originally wanted the right to schedule workers for a
12-hour work day, Parton said. The company also wanted the employees
to help pay medical insurance premiums. Both demands were withdrawn,
Parton said.
   The agreement was reached Thursday in Chicago.

<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission and Morgan
Stanley &amp; Co. declined comment Friday about reports of an
investigation into the investment firm's trading practices during
the 1987 stock market crash.
   The Wall Street Journal reported in its Friday editions that the
SEC is investigating whether Morgan Stanley violated the short-sale
rule, which prevents short sellers from intentionally depressing a
stock price.
   Selling short is the sale of borrowed stock by investors who
believe the price of a stock will decline and that they will be able
to profit by repaying their borrowings with cheaper shares.
   The strategy is legal but trading rules prohibit short sales when
a stock price already is falling.
   Lawrence Iason, head of the SEC's New York regional office,
refused to confirm or deny the existence of an investigation, citing
commission rules.
   Iason also declined to say whether any firm's short sales during
the crash were under investigation or even under review.
   Morgan Stanley, one of Wall Street's most prestigious firms, was
equally silent on the subject.
   ``We don't comment on such matters,'' said Peter Roche, a Morgan
Stanley spokesman.
   Last month, Salomon Brothers Inc. was censured as part of a
settlement with the SEC about its own short-sale activities during
the Oct. 19, 1987 stock market crash. Salomon neither admitted nor
denied guilt under the settlement.
   At the time many on Wall Street suspected the SEC was looking at
similar activity by other investment firms.
   According to the Journal, Morgan Stanley contends the government
retroactively is trying to impose more a stringent method of
counting stock positions at a given time.
   Many Wall Streeters have said privately that short-selling
aggravated the spectacular drop in stock prices on Black Monday,
when the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 508 points.

   Analysts saw the surprise decline as a sign that the economy
might be slowing more dramatically than previously forecast.
   That stirred some stepped-up talk of a possible business slump.
But brokers said it also raised expectations of falling interest
rates and reduced inflation.
   In the credit markets, prices of long-term government bonds
soared about $15 for each $1,000 in face value, lowering their yield
to the 8.18 percent-8.23 percent range. Since early spring those
bond interest rates have fallen more than a percentage point.
   Optimists in the financial world argue that as evidence of a
weakening economy mounts, the Federal Reserve will relax its credit
policy to cushion the impact of the ``landing.''

   Here are sales results for the eight major U.S.
automakers for second period of June 1989.
   Percentage changes in sales are based on average daily sales
during each period rather than comparisons of straight totals. There
were eight selling days in the period this year and eight selling
days last year.
   For the first two sales periods of the month, there were 17
selling days this year and 17 selling days last year, and for the
year so far, 144 selling days this year and 145 selling days last
year.
   Cars and trucks made in the United States by Honda, Nissan,
Toyota, Mazda and Mitsubishi are counted as domestic and appear in
this table.
   Cars and trucks imported for sale under the GM, Ford and Chrysler
names are counted as foreign. Sales of imported cars and trucks are
reported at the end of each month.

<TEXT>
   United Auto Workers President Owen Bieber
on Friday moved the head of the union's Ford Department to
leadership of the General Motors Department as part of a shuffle of
vice presidents.
   Bieber announced the assignments after the 1 million-member
union's weeklong triennial constitutional convention ended with the
delegates' approval of a 135-page book of resolutions on labor,
social and political issues.
   Bieber said Vice President Stephen Yokich would move from
directing the union's Ford Department to the GM Department,
succeeding retired vice president Donald Ephlin. Succeeding Yokich
will be newly elected Vice President Ernie Lofton.
   Another new vice president, Stan Marshall, will take over the
union's Chrysler Department, following Marc Stepp, who also retired.
Vice President Odessa Kommer, the union's most senior vice
president, will remain in charge of a variety of smaller departments.
   Each of the assignments was expected.
   In addition to the general assigments, Yokich will be responsible
for the Skilled Trades Department. Marshall also will take over
direction of the union's organizing efforts, a task previously
handled by Yokich.
   ``I think we had a tremendous convention,'' Bieber said. ``I
think we go out of this convention very strong and united.''
   The union still is hearing the strongest voices of internal
dissent since Walter Reuther solidified his contol of the UAW in the
mid-1930s.
   The New Directions movement has proved to be a thorn in Bieber's
political side, loudly opposing many of his efforts, including
establishment of joint labor-management programs in factories.
   Despite the opposition, Bieber called the convention a ``huge
political success.''
   New Directions never had the support of more than 20 percent of
the delegates as it lost each of its major convention battles. But
the movement has vowed to become better organized and to return
stronger when the UAW holds its next constitutional convention in
1992 at a site yet to be chosen.

   MCA Inc. plans to open a Universal
Studios tour in London or Paris by 1993, a year after the Euro
Disneyland theme park opens near Paris, company officials say.
   The theme park will include film studios and attractions
highlighting the Hollywood theme, and it will have hotels, specialty
shops, restaurants and perhaps a concert arena, Frank Stanek of MCA
Enterprises International told the Los Angeles Daily News in an
article published Friday.
   Europe is largely underdeveloped in American-type outdoor leisure
activities, he said. ``This is one thing Americans are still able to
export. There's a very high demand for theme parks worldwide.''
   Stanek said final site selection, expected by the end of the
year, depends on government incentives, land costs and availability.
   ``We have no concern about competing with Disney. Our products
are somewhat different,'' said Stanek.
   Disney also downplayed the rivalry with MCA.
   ``We don't look on MCA as competition,'' said Disney spokesman
Tom Deegan. ``We really don't think it's worth commenting on.
They've been talking about doing things _ Japan, Europe, Florida _
for years.''

<HEAD>Tyson Foods to Buy Holly Farms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WOODY BAIRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Holly Farms Corp.'s directors on Friday
accepted rival Tyson Foods Inc.'s $1.4 billion buyout offer and
agreed to pay ConAgra Inc. to drop out of the bidding.
   Under terms of the agreement, ConAgra will receive $50 million to
end a previous merger pact with Holly Farms. The Memphis-based
poultry processor will pay a $20 million termination fee; ConAgra
will receive the remaining $30 million when Tyson completes its
purchase of Holly Farms stock.
   ``It's a done deal,'' said Jim Blair, chief legal counsel
Springdale, Ark.-based Tyson, of the $70-a-share cash offer.
   The settlement boosted ConAgra stock $2.25 a share to $36.25 in
New York Stock Exchange trading. Holly Farms finished at $69.25, up
25 cents a share on the Big Board. Tyson was unchanged at $18.25 in
over-the-counter trading.
   Tyson, the nation's largest poultry processor, began what erupted
into a bidding war over Holly Farms in October, when it offered to
acquire the company for $49 a share in cash and securities.
   In resisting Tyson's advances, Holly Farms announced two attempts
to merge with ConAgra of Omaha, Neb.
   The latest Holly Farms-ConAgra agreement, which was expected to
go before shareholders next month, was based on a stock swap valued
at $1.3 billion, or $68 a share.
   ``Tyson played the game to win. They put out a number that left
Holly's board with no other choice but to accept,'' said John
McMillin, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New
York. ``It was a marriage not of choice by Holly's board but of
necessity.''
   Tyson, Holly Farms and ConAgra also agreed to terminate all
litigation among the companies. Tyson had filed suit in Delaware _
where Holly Farms is incorporated _ accusing the company of wrongly
favoring ConAgra at Tyson's expense. Tyson has asked for $500
million in damages.
   The Holly Farms board also disolved its shareholders' rights plan
or ``poison pill'' aimed at fending off hostile bidders by making an
unwanted takeover prohibitively expensive.
   A Delaware Chancery Court approved the agreement among the three
companies shortly before the Holly Farms board accepted Tyson's bid.
   ``We are pleased that the situation has finally been resolved and
believe that we have an agreement that we can strongly recommend to
our stockholders,'' Holly Farms President R. Lee Taylor said in a
statement.
   Holly Farms has 18.1 million outstanding common shares, but the
$70-a-share purchase will total $1.4 billion on a fully diluted
basis when shares held as bonds are converted, Blair said.
   ``It will ultimately be a merger but it continues as a tender
offer,'' he said. ``We will close our tender offer off and then if
we need a shareholder vote, we will be a majority of the shares.''
   Tyson Foods processes more than 16.5 million chickens a week, and
Holly Farms is a diversified company heavily involved in the sale of
fresh fryers. ConAgra is a diversified company specializing in food
and agricultural services.
   Charles M. Harper, ConAgra's chief executive officer, said his
company was unwilling to meet Tyson's latest bid.
   ``A higher bid would have taken us past the point where we were
confident a merger would meet ConAgra's demanding financial
standards,'' Harper said in a statement.

<HEAD>Hooker and Integrated Resources Nursing Financial Headaches</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two companies teetering under the weight of
burdensome debt loads got crutches this past week to support their
financial footing.
   The severity and causes of the difficulties confronting Hooker
Corp. and Integrated Resources Inc. differ. But in both cases, the
prospect for survival is uncertain and the companies must swallow
some stiff medicine if they are to pull through.
   Cash-strapped Hooker, an Australian property and retail concern
that owns department stores and shopping centers in the United
States, tentatively won a loan repayment reprieve from its bankers
on Friday. The banks also agreed to keep credit lines open.
   To persuade its lenders to go along with a temporary halt on
repaying principal on its loans, Hooker had to hand over power to
them, giving the banks a say in its debt-reduction scheme.
   Five of Hooker's major lenders will work with the company and its
financial advisor on a program of asset sales and other measures to
prune debt that has grown to $1.5 billion.
   Among the assets put up for sale are the Forest Fair Mall in
Cincinnati, the Richland Fashion Mall in Columbia, S.C. and Thornton
Town Center outside Denver. Investment partners are being sought to
take stakes in Hooker's department stores including B. Altman &amp; Co.,
Bonwit Teller, Sakowitz and Parisian and in its planned shopping
center developments.
   Hooker Chairman George Herscu, who owns 53 percent of the
company, did not attend the meeting with Hooker and its bankers in
Sydney, Australia, Friday. His absence stirred speculation about his
future role at Hooker.
   Under Herscu's direction, Hooker became a presence in the
American retailing scene by snapping up strings of established
stores and extending them into malls that Hooker built.
   The company mainly blames high Australian interest rates, which
hurt real estate operations in that country, for causing its current
cash crunch, a condition Hooker says is temporary. Sluggish retail
sales in the United States also have contributed to its troubles,
Hooker says.
   But retail industry analysts say Hooker's wounds are partially
self-inflicted and may be slow to heal.
   In developing shopping sites, the company has paid too much
attention to real-estate ambitions and not enough to basic
merchandising considerations, analysts say. Stores were opened where
they weren't needed and upscale stores were brought to areas in
which inhabitants were more at home in discounters.
   During Hooker's convalescence, the company may be rethinking its
philosophy of linking property development to retail expansion,
analysts say.
   Integrated Resources, which transformed itself from the nation's
biggest seller of tax shelter investments into a financial services
company after the 1986 tax revisions rendered its business virtually
useless, also is doing some self-examination.
   After a sudden threat of disintegration due to a cash shortage,
Integrated started pulling itself together last week and announced a
major overhaul of its operations and measures to cope with its
liquidity needs.
   A lack of liquidity had caused the company to default on $955
million in debt, setting in motion a scramble to steer clear of
bankruptcy court.
   The company now is eplacing short-term debt with fresh
borrowings, has pledged almost all of its $7.8 billion in assets as
collateral on the new borrowing, and intends to curtail operations
and to slash operating expenses by $40 million a year.
   Arthur Goldberg, Integrated's president, said the steps should
allow the company to continue as a viable player in financial
services.
   Wall Street apparently has its doubts; Integrated stock was still
languishing late Friday at around $6 a share, down from about $15 a
week earlier and $40 in 1986.
   Integrated may be heading for another reincarnation.
   Texas investor Robert Bass reportedly is attracted to
Integrated's network of financial consultants who sell investments
ranging from insurance to real estate. A Bass-led group may be
willing to pump much-needed funds into Integrated if they could
obtain an equity holding in the company.
   In other business news this week:
   _Paramount Communications Inc. sweetened its hostile tender offer
for Time Inc. to $200 a share, or about $12.2 billion, from $175 a
share, or $10.7 billion. Paramount, a publisher, movie and TV
producer, is hoping to thwart Time's proposed $14 billion
acquisition of Warner Communications Inc.
   _In other long-running takeover sagas, Holly Farms Corp. agreed
to a $1.4 billion takeover bid from Tyson Foods Inc. If approved by
Holly's board, the plan would end a lengthy hostile takeover fight
between two of the nation's biggest poultry processers.
   Prime Computer Inc., meanwhile, chose a friendly partner to fend
off unwanted suitor MAI Basic Four Inc. Prime picked a takeover
proposal valued at over $1 billion from New York investment firm of
J.H. Whitney &amp; Co.

   The Kapalua Bay Hotel, one of Hawaii's top-rated
hotels, has been sold to a consortium of investors for a reported
$101 million.
   KBH Co., which purchased the hotel for $26 million in 1985, did
not identify the buyers in a brief statement Thursday.
   But The Honolulu Advertiser quoted a hotel industry executive
saying the group included Tokai Kanko, a company that operates
hotels and restaurants in Japan, and the sale price was $101 million.
   Kapalua Bay spokesman Mark Rolfing said no changes in personnel
or the style of management at the 194-room hotel were apparent.
   KBH acquired the hotel from Maui Land &amp; Pineapple Co., which owns

<HEAD>FAA Indicates Eastern's Maintenance System Has Flaws</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines' maintenance system has failed
to make needed repairs to malfunctioning aircraft equipment, even
after repeated complaints by pilots, according to a team of
investigators from the Federal Aviation Administration.
   In a brief statement Friday, the Department of Transportation
said the FAA team has discovered numerous examples of ``chronic
failure'' to correct equipment deficiencies at the strikebound
carrier's Miami and Atlanta bases.
   ``The results indicate that management personnel were allowing
aircraft to be moved without adequate corrective action,'' Joseph
Doubleday, the FAA inspection team leader, wrote in a June 7 report
to FAA official Roger V. Gordon. ``We feel this was driven in part
by the intense pressure to meet on-time performance goals of a
special incentive program.''
   A copy of Doubleday's report was obtained by The Associated Press.
   Eastern disputes the FAA's findings. In a detailed, six-page
letter to Gordon sent on Thursday, John J. Keyser, Eastern's vice
president for regulatory compliance, said Doubleday's report ``lacks
needed perspective.''
   Gordon, the FAA manager with lead responsibility for Eastern, was
on vacation and was unavailable for comment Friday.
   Eastern's unions and others have raised questions about
maintenance and safety at the Miami-based airline, which has
weathered a crippling strike and a bankruptcy filing since early
March.
   Early last month, Eastern temporarily surrendered its repair
station certificate at New York's John F. Kennedy International
Airport after the FAA determined the carrier had failed to follow
its system for recording and inspecting maintenance work.
   Soon after the JFK certificate was pulled, the FAA sent Doubleday
and nine other inspectors to Eastern's main base in Miami to
determine if widespread violations of maintenance record-keeping
rules, such as those found in New York, existed in Miami and Atlanta.
   JFK, Miami International and Atlanta's Hartsfield International
are the sites of Eastern's three principal maintenance facilities.
Most of the Atlanta records eventually are sent to Miami.
   Doubleday's report said the Miami investigation did not find
``fraudulent or forged maintenance documentation as a systemic
problem.''
   However, he said the team, which reviewed records for 29 planes
from January 1988 through May 1989, discovered problems with
Eastern's ``continuing analysis and surveillance system.'' Those
problems led to chronic failure to repair deficiencies reported by
pilots, the report said.
   The report cites 30 examples of repairs that weren't made on
different aircraft despite repeated reports. The affected equipment
included automatic landing devices, fire warning signals, engine
gauges, altitude alert systems and windshield wipers.
   In some cases, Doubleday's team said, several ``inappropriate
corrective actions'' were taken. One example involved an engine
brake on a Lockheed L1011 Tristar that was found to be inoperative
or slow to operate on landing. Maintenance managers failed to note
the problem 17 times, according to the report.
   Eastern's unions have accused the company of ``pencil-whipping,''
a reference to maintenance supervisors signing off on aircraft
repairs that weren't done.
   Although the FAA inspection covered a period both before and
during the Eastern strike, ``it is significant that all of the
discrepancies listed in the report related to pre-strike
activities,'' Keyser wrote in his letter to Gordon.
   The new mechanics and pilots hired by Eastern during the strike
have brought a ``new cooperative spirit'' and a ``cultural change''
in the workforce which have meant fewer problems, Keyser said.
   The airline has been largely grounded since the strike started
March 4, operating only around 10 percent of its normal schedule of
1,040 flights daily.
   Rep. Cardiss Collins, D-Ill., chairwoman of the House
subcommittee on Government Activities and Transportation, recently
expressed concern to acting FAA Administrator Robert E. Whittington
that shortages of staff and spare parts could be hampering Eastern's
ability to maintain its fleet.

   The stock market swept ahead Friday to new highs
since the 1987 crash in buying encouraged by fresh evidence of a
slowing economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 49.70 to 2,531.87,
surpassing the previous closing post-crash high of 2,517.83 it
reached on June 2.
   The gain, the largest for the average in six weeks, left it with
a net rise of 45.49 points for the week.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
1,078 up, 441 down and 469 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 198.72 million
shares, up from 176.51 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those
stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market,
totaled 233.85 million shares.
   The Commerce Department reported Friday morning that new factory
orders for durable goods fell 4.2 percent in May. Wall Street had
been expecting them to be unchanged or slightly higher.
   Analysts saw the surprise decline as a sign that the economy
might be slowing more dramatically than previously forecast.
   That stirred some stepped-up talk of a possible business slump.
But brokers said it also raised expectations of falling interest
rates and reduced inflation.
   In the credit markets, prices of long-term government bonds
soared about $15 for each $1,000 in face value, lowering their yield
to the 8.18 percent-8.23 percent range. Since early spring bond
interest rates have fallen more than a percentage point.
   Optimists in the financial world argue that as evidence of a
weakening economy mounts, the Federal Reserve will relax its credit
policy to cushion the impact of the ``landing.''
   Gainers among the blue chips included American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph, up } at 37 on heavy volume of almost 9 million shares;
International Business Machines, up 1} at 110~; General Electric, up
1[ at 54}; McDonald's, up 1[ at 30{, and Philip Morris, up 4{ at
142{.
   Prime Computer gained 3[ to 19. The company, which has been
fighting a hostile takeover by MAI Basic Four Inc., agreed to be
acquired by the New York investment firm of J.H. Whitney &amp; Co.
   Time Inc. rose 10{ to 165~. After the close, Paramount
Industries, which is bidding to wrest Time away from a planned
merger with Warner Communications, raised its offer for the company
from $175 a share to $200 a share.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $44.95 billion, or 1.41
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks gained
2.81 to 182.86.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 6.63 to 375.06, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was up 5.68 at 328.00.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
climbed 3.03 to 448.36. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 364.25, up 2.04.

   As they survey the financial scene approaching
mid-year, many analysts say the stock market is likely to have a
tough time duplicating its first-half performance over the remainder
of 1989.
   By various measures, the market has risen 15 to 20 percent since
the start of the year. An advance of similar proportions from its
current levels would take the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials to
the 2,850-3,000 range.
   While such a feat is certainly not impossible, analysts say, it
is a lot to expect, especially considering all the things that
already have gone in the market's favor this year.
   ``The best and easiest money is definitely behind us,'' asserts
Joseph Feshbach, technical analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities.
   In its midyear forecast, Standard &amp; Poor's weekly publication The
Outlook says, ``We're looking for further gains. This isn't,
however, a market that's likely to run away on the upside.
   ``Lately just about everything has been breaking the right way.
That can't continue very much longer.''
   What could happen to stifle enthusiasm for stocks? For one thing,
analysts say, hopes for a ``soft landing'' _ a benign slowing of
economic growth _ could give way to fears of recession.
   Alternatively, some observers say, the soft landing could occur
as expected, but investors could wind up feeling sorry that they got
what they wished for.
   ``You do not need a recession to get a decline in profits,''
observes Thomas Doerflinger at PaineWebber Inc. ``Even a `soft
landing' for the gross national product can be a `hard landing' for
profits.
   ``If the probability of earnings disappointments is high in the
second half of this year, it is still higher next year.''
   In the past week, investors demonstrated that they still see
evidence of a weakening economy in a favorable light.
   Spurred on by word of an unexpected decline in durable goods
orders for May, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 45.49 points
during the week to a post-crash high of 2,531.87.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 3.27 to
182.86; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
added 1.15 to 448.36, and the American Stock Exchange market value
index was up 2.42 at 364.25.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 168.49 million shares a day,
down from 182.17 million the week before.
   As described by James Grant, editor of the newsletter Grant's
Interest Rate Observer and a noted bear on the financial outlook,
the recent case of Integrated Resources Inc. illustrates a dangerous
complacency and vulnerability to unpleasant surprises in the stock
and credit markets.
   Integrated's securities plunged in price on the news that the
real estate and financial services company had run out of credit.
   The latest published list of Integrated's shareholders, as of
March 31, included some prominent mutual funds and money management
firms.
   ``Many are the lessons of Integrated Resources,'' Grant wrote.
``To start with, even the most successful and celebrated investors
can fall asleep at the switch.
   ``The poleaxing of the Integrated capitalization is a reminder
that when disaster strikes, it strikes fast.
   ``Perhaps the foremost lesson of the Integrated crack-up is that
faith runs deep,'' Grant added, noting that the news of it seemed to
have few ripple effects in the high-yield ``junk bond'' market or in
the market for low-rated and unrated commercial paper, a form of
short-term IOUs issued by companies.
   ``For the time being,'' Grant concluded, ``institutional
investors continue to believe that every day is the first day of
spring.''

   Fixed-rate home mortgages are averaging 10.19
percent, according to a national survey released Friday by the
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
   That rate was up from 10.04 percent last week.
   On one-year adjustable rate mortgages, lenders were asking an
average initial rate of 9 percent this week, up from 8.95 percent
the week before, the agency said.

   The dollar continued its recent retreat against
most major currencies Friday as selling momentum carried over from
previous sessions.
   Gold prices posted gains in the United States after a mixed
performance overseas. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a
bid of $377 for a troy ounce of gold bullion at 4 p.m. EDT, up from
Thursday's late bid of $370.25.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar has been sagging due to
a lack of interest in buying the American currency at a time when
central banks seem determined to keep it from moving significantly
higher.
   Central banks stepped into the market several times during the
week and sold dollars, pushing it down.
   Much of the intervention was aimed at supporting the beleaguered
British pound. Currency dealers have dumped sterling lately as
Britain's economic difficulties, including strikes by various labor
unions, have eroded confidence in the currency.
   Traders seemed to be selling dollars Friday in anticipation of
possible dollar declines in Asian trading over the weekend, analysts
said.
   The markets paid little attention to a Commerce Department report
that showed orders for durable goods _ expensive items that have a
lifespan of at least several years _ plunged 4.2 percent in May.
Traders said implications of the drop were uncertain because durable
goods estimates are frequently revised.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 140.35 Japanese yen, down from
141.40. In London late Friday the dollar traded lower at 138.50 yen
and it ended in New York at 138.85 yen, down from 139.30 Thursday.
   A British pound cost $1.5675 late Friday, more expensive for
buyers than Thursday's late $1.5525. The late New York quote for
sterling was $1.5645 compared to $1.5585 Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Thursday's
rates, included: 1.9425 West German marks, down from 1.9515; 1.6660
Swiss francs, down from 1.6820; 1.19425 Canadian dollars, up from
1.19135; 6.6000 French francs, down from 6.6215; and, 1,410.50
Italian lire, down from 1,417.75.
   Late rates for the dollar in Europe compared to Thursday's late
levels were: 1.9390 West German marks, down from 1.9590; 1.6690
Swiss francs, down from 1.6860; 6.5790 French francs, down from
6.6325; 2.1850 Dutch guilders, down from 2.2005; 1,412.50 Italian
lire, down from 1,418.50; and, 1.1910 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1925.
   Gold prices rose sharply in New York and London but edged lower
in Zurich.
   At the end of London's trading day, gold was $8 an ounce higher.
The bullion market attributed the rise to the falling dollar and to
the influence of price changes in New York where gold rose when the
market opened, five hours behind London.
   Gold closed in London at $377.75 bid a troy ounce, up from
Thursday's closing bid of $369.75. It was gold's best level in
London since May 11 when it stood at $379.
   Gold closed in Zurich at a bid of $370, down from $370.60. In
Hong Kong, gold closed at $369.25 compared to Thursday's $369.50.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York gold bullion for current
delivery closed at $378.50 a troy ounce, up from Thursday settlement
price of $371.
   Silver prices also finished mixed. On New York's Comex, silver
bullion for current delivery settled at $5.330 a troy ounce, up from
$5.292 on Thursday. Silver bullion traded late in London at a bid of
$5.25, a troy ounce, down from $5.34.

   Sales of U.S.-built cars and light trucks sagged
9.8 percent in the June 11-20 period compared with brisk mid-June
sales last year. Analysts said automakers' enticements were losing
their allure.
   The novelty of sales incentives by General Motors Corp., Ford
Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. was wearing off in a saturated market,
said analyst David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York.
   ``The rebates have shot their wad,'' Healy said. ``Americans are
still paying off too many cars they bought last year to go out and
buy too many more.''
   In addition, interest rates are higher and employment growth
slower than at this time last year, said analyst Harvey Heinbach of
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in New York. ``We think this is causing consumer
confidence to be soft and customers to stay out of the showrooms,''
he said.
   U.S.-made cars and light trucks sold at an average daily rate of
39,392 during the period, down from a rate of 43,682 a day in the
comparable period in 1988.
   Car sales were down 10.9 percent. Light truck sales declined 8
percent for the period.
   For the year through June 20, car and truck sales lagged 3.7
percent behind those of last year. The average daily rate so far
this year was 38,016, down from 39,481 through mid-June 1988.
   For the year, car sales were down 5 percent and light truck sales
were down 1.4 percent from last year.
   Ford had the greatest decline in car sales and GM the greatest
slowdown in truck sales among the Big Three automakers.
   Ford said its mid-June car sales dropped 13.9 percent to an
average daily rate of 7,197 this year from 8,356 last year. Ford's
light truck sales for the period were down 6 percent.
   Ford's car sales were down 1.6 percent and its truck sales were
down 3.1 percent for the year.
   GM reported mid-June car sales dropping 8.6 percent to a daily
rate of 12,344 from 13,510 in the 1988 mid-June sales period. GM
truck sales for the period dropped 10.8 percent.
   That left GM car sales down 8.6 percent for the year and truck
sales down 1.9 percent.
   Chrysler said it sold an average of 3,380 cars a day in the
mid-June period, down 12.6 percent from 3,867 last year. Chrysler
said its light truck sales declined 5.8 percent for the period.
   For the year, Chrysler car sales were down 13.9 percent and truck
sales were down 0.3 percent.

   Crude futures prices leaped Friday amid reports
of ongoing problems in North Sea oil production and word that Norway
is renewing oil output curbs.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the August contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, rose 41
cents to close at $19.71 a barrel after slipping a penny in the
previous session. Other contract months also advanced.
   Among refined products, heating oil for July delivery gained 0.87
cent to 49.49 cents a gallon. Other contract months were narrowly
higher.
   Unleaded gasoline prices also rose, with the July contract up
1.93 cents to 62.92 cents a gallon. Contracts after July showing
more modest gains.
   Analysts said oil prices got a lift early in the session from
reports that repair delays on oil production equipment would
continue to reduce output from the North Sea. Chevron Corp. also
confirmed that pipeline leaks this month shut down two of its North
Sea platforms, causing further production losses.
   Norway, meanwhile, announced Friday that it would continue to
withhold 7.5 percent in planned output for the remainder of the year
to support OPEC's efforts to raise world oil prices. The cut amounts
to 120,000 barrels per day, according to Nauman Barakat, analyst
with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Norway, a non-OPEC country, is Western Europe's second largest
producer after Britain.
   Traders said prices also got a boost from gasoline futures, which
continued to recover after a sell-off in the last few weeks.

<HEAD>Gold Surges on Weakening Dollar</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold futures prices surged more than $7 a troy ounce Friday on
New York's Commodity Exchange, capping that market's biggest weekly
move in nine months.
   Analysts cited the dollar's pronounced weakness as a major factor
in the rally, which boosted the spot price of an ounce of gold by
$13.40 in five days to $378.50.
   Silver and platinum futures prices also advanced.
   On other markets Friday, soybean and petroleum futures rose
strongly while livestock and meat futures were mixed.
   Gold settled $7.10 to $7.60 higher with the contract for spot
delivery at $378.50 a troy ounce and the more actively traded August
contract at $381.80. Silver was 2.7 cents to 3.8 cents higher with
July at $5.338 a troy ounce.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum futures settled
$12.90 to $14.10 higher with July at $516.60 a troy ounce, a
six-week high.
   Gold prices have not made as large a weekly move since the week
of Sept. 19, when prices dropped about $18 an ounce.
   ``This was some of the best action we've seen in a long time _ a
really nice finish to a nice week,'' said Craig Sloane, a metals
analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. in New York.
   Because gold is denominated in dollars on the world market, a
weakening of the dollar's value against other major currencies makes
gold cheaper overseas, which encourages foreign buying.
   A weaker dollar also makes U.S. goods cheaper overseas, which can
boost orders to U.S. manufacturers, potentially contributing to
inflation. Gold is perceived as an investment hedge against
inflation.
   Friday's rally followed a gain of more than $6 in the gold market
on Wednesday and pushed prices through some key points of
psychological resistance, which analysts took as a bullish sign.
   Soybean futures posted strong gains on the Chicago Board of Trade
amid fears of a global supply squeeze wrought by a producer-led halt
to Brazilian soybean sales.
   Wheat and oat futures retreated while corn was narrowly mixed.
   Brazilian soybean growers stopped selling their crops to
processors about two weeks ago to protest their government's
economic policies.
   Now rumors are spreading that some Brazilian soybean crushers
will be forced to delay shipments of soybean meal and oil to their
European trading partners.
   If those shipments are delayed, demand and prices for U.S.
soybeans are likely to rise.
   Soybeans settled 1 cent to 9} cents higher with July at $7.31 a
bushel; wheat was unchanged to 2} cents lower with July at $3.97{ a
bushel; corn was 3{ cents lower to } cent higher with July at $2.62
a bushel; oats were 4\ cents to 4{ cents lower with July at $1.52{ a
bushel.
   A reported reduction in North Sea crude-oil production helped to
boost energy futures prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 13 cents to 41 cents
higher with August at $19.71 a barrel; heating oil was .87 cent to
1.01 cents higher with July at 49.49 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was 1.18 cents to 1.93 cents higher with July at 62.92
cents a gallon.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mixed on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange in subdued trading ahead of the Agriculture
Department's monthly cold storage report.
   The report showed 143.8 million pounds of frozen pork bellies in
public warehouses as of June 1, well below the average pre-report
estimate of 147.8 million pounds. Analysts said pork-belly futures
may open higher Monday in reaction to the surprising report.
   Live cattle were .10 cent to .48 cent lower with August at 69.87
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .30 cent lower to .05 cent higher
with August at 81.12 cents a pound; live hogs were .20 cent lower to
.47 cent higher with July at 49.67 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .27 cent lower to .17 cent higher with July at 33.67
cents a pound.

<HEAD>Prime Agrees To Merger With J.H. Whitney</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 4th graf to UPDATE with closing stock price</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   J.H. Whitney &amp; Co., the nation's oldest venture
capital firm, said Friday it has agreed to buy Prime Computer Inc.
in a friendly merger valued at about $1.25 billion.
   Prime, a minicomputer maker based in Natick, had been searching
for a ``white knight'' to ward off a $1.13 billion hostile bid from
MAI Basic Four Inc. of Tustin, Calif.
   Prime's board of directors unanimously approved the merger with
Whitney, but MAI said it was preparing to boost its offer, raising
the possibility of a bidding war that could sink the deal.
   Whitney's announcement sent Prime's stock soaring on the New York
Stock Exchange. It closed at $19 a share, up $3.12{. MAI's stock
dropped to $6.25, down 12{ cents.
   The merger would be the largest single investment ever for
Whitney, a private New York firm founded in 1946 by wealthy
industrialist John Hay Whitney, said Don E. Ackerman, a general
partner in the firm.
   Whitney said it would pay $21.50 a share in cash for 79 percent
of Prime's common stock. The remaining 21 percent would be exchanged
for bonds with a face value of $22 a share and an interest rate of
15.5 percent.
   Since the bonds are likely to trade at less than face value, Wall
Street securities analysts estimated the blended value of the offer
at $20 a share, or $1.25 billion. Prime has 62.6 million shares of
common stock on a fully diluted basis.
   MAI originally had offered $20 a share for Prime last November.
On June 1, however, MAI Chairman Bennett S. LeBow announced a cut in
its offer to $19.50 in cash for the outstanding shares, plus a
mixture of securities with a face value of $21 a share for the
remaining stock.
   Analysts have valued MAI's offer at about $18 a share, or $1.13
billion. But some expect it to rise.
   ``Is it too late for (MAI) to top this one? Presumably not.
You're in an auction mode,'' said John W. Adams, who follows Prime
for the Boston investment firm of Adams Harkness &amp; Hill.
   Barry F. Willman, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. in
New York, said the eight-month takeover battle has scared away
customers and depressed Prime's earnings.
   ``The longer this drags on, the more the value of the asset _ the
company _ declines,'' Willman said. ``MAI is going to have to take a
good hard look at whether continuing to pursue this is in its best
interest.''
   MAI and Prime had been heading for a showdown at Prime's July 26
annual meeting, when MAI said it would wage a proxy battle for
control of the board of directors.
   MAI spokesman Toni Lee said Friday it would have no immediate
comment on the Prime-Whitney agreement.
   Whitney said Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. agreed to
provide $460 million of bridge financing for the merger, while
Whitney and Shearson together have committed $200 million of equity
and debt.
   Two leading banks, Chemical Bank and the First National Bank of
Boston, also have agreed to put up $600 million of financing,
Whitney said.
   Ackerman, the Whitney partner, said it would operate Prime as an
independent entity and did not plan to sell any operations to repay
debt incurred in the buyout.
   One of Whitney's 10 general partners, Russell Planitzer, was
Prime's treasurer from the early 1970s until 1980, when he joined
Whitney. As a result, Ackerman said, ``We know Prime very well and
... we certainly thought it was undervalued at the price LeBow
offered.''
   Prime makes minicomputers and is the second largest producer of
computer aided design and manufacturing systems, surpassed only by
International Business Machines Corp. It has 11,200 employees and
had 1988 sales of $1.6 billion.

   Congressmen from all 50 states asked the
U.S. Department of Agriculture Friday to buy nearly 5 million boxes
of apples to help cut a huge surplus created by the Alar controversy.
   The request came in a letter, signed by 114 members of the House
of Representatives, to Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter, said
U.S. Rep. Sid Morrison, R-Wash., who represents a region growing
half the nation's apples.
   ``Apple industry estimates show that some 5 million to 7 million
boxes of apples valued at between $40 million and $56 million in the
current depressed market are now stalled in the world's distribution
pipeline as a result of the scare,'' Morrison said.
   The Natural Resources Defense Council, a private group, issued a
report in February saying eating apples treated with the chemical
growth regulator Alar increased cancer risk in children.
   The report's findings have been disputed, but the federal
government announced plans to ban Alar and consumer sales fell.
   An Agriculture Department program allows the emergency purchase
of $350 million to $500 million in farm products. Yeutter is being
asked to dip into that fund to bail out the nation's 20,000 apple
growers, who have estimated losses of well over $100 million in
sales as a result of the scare.
   The government could give the surplus apples to schools, prisons
and public assistance feeding programs, said Morrison. They could
also be used for production of ethanol or cattle feed, he said.
   An Agriculture Department spokesman in Washington, D.C., Clarence
Steinberg, said the agency has not discussed how it will respond to
the request.
   ``Certainly he's (Yeutter) responsive to congressional
interest,'' Steinberg said.
   Derl Derr, executive vice president of the McLean, Va.-based
International Apple Institute, said apple inventories were 41
percent above what they should be on June 1.
   That figure shows signs of increasing rather than decreasing as
the season progresses, Derr said.
   Apple growers have been complaining in recent weeks that
plummeting wholesale prices, down over 40 percent since the
controversy began in February, have not been reflected in lower
retail prices.
   They complain that discourages consumer sales and is helping
build up the surplus.
   The top grade of red apples produced in Washington, which grows
about half the nation's annual supply, remained at $7.50 to $8 per
box last week, according to the federal-state Market News Service.
That is about $2 below the cost of production.
   That has prompted some growers to suggest giving away apples to
the poor, rather than selling them at a loss, as a way to
demonstrate their plight.

   Strikebound Eastern Airlines on Friday kept up the
flurry of transactions it calls part of its rebuilding plan by
delivering an L1011 widebody plane to Worldways of Canada and two
Boeing 727-200s to Avianca of Colombia.
   The short-term lease deals recently were approved by U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in New York and will give Eastern $900,000 over
four months from Worldways and $1.9 million from Avianca.
   ``We're moving ahead on our plan,'' said Eastern spokesman Robin
Matell, referring to Eastern's stated goal of paying off $900
million in debt and emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy
reorganization as a smaller carrier after $1.8 billion in asset
sales, includings sales and leases of planes, airport gates and
routes.
   Matell said the company wouldn't release specific figures on the
total number of asset transactions accomplished so far. However,
deals either already approved by the bankruptcy court or submitted
for approval total nearly $900 million.
   Eastern's unions, who want a buyout of the airline as a whole,
have said they will challenge all asset sales.
   On Thursday, Eastern said it would ask permission to sell its
last two Boeing 727-100 jets to Express One of Dallas for $9
million. On Tuesday, Eastern said it wants to lease an Airbus A300
to Venezuela's Viasa for $1.4 million over four months.
   Miami-based Eastern last week announced a deal to sell eight
Philadelphia airport gates, 16 jets and other assets to Midway
Airlines for $206.5 million.
   Under Eastern's proposed rebuilding plan, it wants to cut its
pre-strike fleet of 255 aircraft to 157 planes, serving 77
locations, down from 102 before the strike that started March 4.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland must approve any asset
sales, but he already has approved the $365 million sale of
Eastern's Northeast shuttle service to developer Donald Trump. Last
week, he approved the $277.5 million sale of 15 planes and six
engines to an aircraft leasing company.
   Eastern filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization on March
9, five days after its pilots and flight attendants unions joined a
Machinists union strike that crippled the airline. While the unions
have vowed not to return to work under Texas Air Corp. Chairman
Frank Lorenzo and want Lorenzo to sell Eastern, Texas Air is moving
ahead with its own plan to make Eastern an airline about two-thirds
its pre-strike size.
   Eastern on Thursday filed a request with the bankruptcy court to
end its contract with the pilots union and allow the company to cut
pilots' pay and increase their work hours.
   Also on Thursday, Rep. Glenn Anderson, D-Calif., chairman of the
aviation subcommittee of the House Public Works and Transportation
Committee, announced that his panel will hold a hearing next
Thursday on Eastern's condition and ``the prospects for its
restoration as a major carrier.''
   Two congressmen earlier asked Transportation Secretary Samuel
Skinner to enter Eastern's bankruptcy case out of ``urgent'' concern
that the carrier's restructuring could lessen U.S. airline
competition.
   In a letter Wednesday to Skinner, House Republican Whip Newt
Gingrich of Georgia and Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., expressed
concern that antitrust issues have not been addressed adequately in
the Eastern bankruptcy proceedings.

   Golden Valley Microwave Foods Inc. said Friday
it is being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission
for alleged accounting improprieties.
   The company's stock sunk $1 to close Friday at $24.12{ a share in
composite New York Stock Exchange trading on the news.
   The maker of microwave popcorn, pancakes and french fries said
the investigation was prompted by ``disgruntled former employees who
were recently terminated by the company.''
   The company said in a statement that it is cooperating with the
SEC, but maintained that its recently audited financial statements
are proper.
   ``There are certain alleged accounting improprieties,'' Golden
Valley spokesman Curt Swenson said. ``We can't comment beyond that.''
   The SEC also would not comment.
   USA Today, without revealing its sources, reported Friday that
the investigation centers on allegations the company ``fabricated
some of its revenues, thus creating phony earnings.''
   The newspaper also said the SEC is investigating whether some
company officers used company funds for personal expenses.
   Swenson said the company had no comment on the story.
   In the third quarter of 1988, Golden Valley Microwave booked 33
percent increases in sales and earnings. Sales jumped to $32.9
million from $24.7 million and profits increased to 36 cents a share
from 27 cents a share.
   For the year, the company earned $16.8 million, or $1.40 a share,
on sales of $140 million. That compares to 1987 earnings of $12.3
million, or $1.04 a share, on sales of $101 million.
   The company, which has 720 employees, was founded in 1978 and has
enjoyed explosive growth in recent years. In 1985, for instance,
earnings were only 14 cents a share. The year before they were 2
cents a share.
   Swenson would not identify the former employees thecompany said
made the allegations to the SEC.
   Patrick Tyk, one of about 15 Golden Valley Microwave executives
fired in early February, said he has been questioned by the SEC
about his former employer.
   But Tyk would not say whether he made allegations against the
company, nor would he say what the SEC asked him about.
   Tyk, a former controller at the company, said he was told by
superiors the February firings were part of a corporate
restructuring.
   The company said it has asked the SEC to investigate investors
who have sold its stock short. A short-seller borrows shares, sells
them and profits if the stock price falls before he must replace the
borrowed shares.

   Paramount Communications Inc. on Friday boosted
by $1.5 billion to $12.2 billion its hostile takeover offer for
media giant Time Inc., which is pursuing its own bid for Warner
Communications Inc.
   Paramount, which indicated in making its initial $175-a-share
offer for Time earlier this month that it was open to raising the
offer, said it had sweetened its cash bid to $200 a share.
   In a letter to Time Chairman and Chief Executive J. Richard
Munro, Paramount's chairman and chief executive Martin S. Davis
renewed his request for a meeting to ``address any concerns you
might have and to negotiate all aspects of our proposal.''
   Time, which rejected Paramount's earlier $10.7 billion takeover
bid, issued a statement saying the Time board ``will consider
Paramount's increased tender offer in due course.''
   ``Time Inc. advises its shareholders not to act on the offer
until they hear from Time,'' the statement read.
   But securities analysts said the new offer increases the pressure
on Time to devise something that can provide its shareholders with
value that comes close to matching Paramount's all-cash offer.
   Time has launched its own $14 billion bid for Warner.
   Paramount made its announcement shortly after the stock market
closed, but Time stock already had rocketed higher on speculation
about the possibility that Paramount would raise its bid.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Time rose $10.50 a
share to $165.87{. Paramount was down 50 cents a share at $58 and
Warner was off 50 cents a share to $58.62{.
   The sweetened offer for Time follows a week in which Paramount
and Time swapped increasingly bitter charges in state and federal
courts in an effort to stop each other's takeover bids.
   Many analysts are looking to a scheduled July 11 hearing in
Delaware Chancery Court as a potentially pivotal date in the fight
for Time. Paramount said it intends to extend its offer until the
Delaware court rules on its motion to block Time's buyout of Warner.
   Time rejected Paramount's previous bid a week ago as inadequate
and highly conditional. At the same time, it revised its earlier
plan to merge with Warner in a stock swap and instead launched a
$70-a-share bid for Warner.
   The move has angered some Time shareholders who would have been
allowed to vote on the planned stock swap merger with Warner but are
not being asked to vote on the Time buyout of the record, film and
cable concern.
   Time argues that a combination with Warner _ which would create
the world's biggest communications concern _ eventually would be
worth much more than the up-front cash payment Paramount is offering.
   In his letter to Munro, Davis said he hoped the Time board and
management ``will now discontinue your efforts to preclude
stockholder choice and give Time's shareholders an opportunity to
consider our offer.''
   J. Kendrick Noble, a media analyst for the securities firm
PaineWebber, said the new offer for Time ``does put the pressure on
Time.''
   He said the company could still conclude the Paramount bid was
inadequate, but may have to work up a new plan in connection with
the Warner buyout to give disgruntled shareholders something
matching the price Paramount is offering.
   ``It's possible they can work out something else,'' Noble said,
but added it was ``tough to assess the outcome.''
   Paramount said its offer remained subject to several conditions,
including the obtaining of financing, termination of the Warner
offer and rescinding a stock swap in which Time and Warner gave
additional new shares to each other.
   Paramount estimated it will need $15.6 billion in financing for
the new offer, including $12.2 billion simply to buy the stock.
   It said Citibank had agreed to provide $1 billion in financing
and was highly confident it could arrange a syndicate of bank
lenders to provide an additional $13 billion.
   Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. has said it could arrange the placement of
an addtional $1.6 billion in subordinated securities, Paramount said.
   ``Despite all the rhetoric, all the talk of `war' and `rockets,'
we continue to believe that if we work together we can structure a
transaction that will be in the best interests of both of our
companies and their stockholders,'' Davis wrote.

   Consumer spending and income growth both slowed
in May to a lackluster 0.3 percent, the slowest pace since the fall,
the government said Friday in another indication the economy is
losing steam.
   Consumer spending represents two-thirds of the U.S. economy, and
analysts closely monitor fluctations in both spending and income as
a barometer of the economy's overall health.
   The gain in Americans' income to a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of $4.39 trillion was the slowest since September, the Commerce
Department said. The rise in personal consumer spending to an annual
rate of $3.44 trillion was the weakest since October.
   If the rising cost of living is factored out, both spending and
income actually declined in May. Economist Allen Sinai of The Boston
Co. called the report ``almost recession-like.''
   ``Consumer spending, adjusted for inflation, normally keeps going
up, so this is very weak,'' he said.
   However, economic consultant Michael K. Evans of Washington said
spending growth had paused temporarily because consumers were forced
to pay higher-than-expected tax bills in April and higher gasoline
and food prices in April and May.
   ``The average consumer got hit by a one-two punch,'' he said. ``I
think consumer spending will come back cautiously in the third
quarter. If I didn't, I'd be predicting a recession.''
   The May income boost followed stronger gains of 0.5 percent in
April and 0.9 percent in March. However, the Commerce Department
noted that the March rise was inflated by two special factors:
profit-sharing payments to auto workers and retroactive Social
Security checks. That made the April increase look smaller.
   April was also held back by a dip in farm payments, and that in
turn made the small May rise appear larger.
   ``If you take those numbers together, personal income is still
moving up, but at a more sedate pace. We're looking at an economy
that is slowing, which is what the Federal Reserve wanted,'' said
economist Lyle Gramley of the Mortgage Bankers Association of
America.
   The Fed has been fighting inflation with higher interest rates
since March 1988. It recently has allowed rates to come down a bit.
   Gramley, a former Fed member, said Friday's report likely
wouldn't cause the central bank to ease further now, but he said the
Fed may loosen its grip on credit another notch in a week or two.
   Disposable, or after-tax, income surged 1.4 percent in May after
falling 0.7 percent in April. Tax payments took a
larger-than-expected bite out of income in April and returned to a
more normal level in May.
   The personal savings rate, representing the percentage of
after-tax income saved by Americans, rose to 5.3 percent in May from
4.3 percent in April.
   The savings rate has been averaging about 5.1 percent this year,
up from 4.2 percent last year and a historic low of 3.2 percent in
1987. Analysts believe the rising savings rate this year indicates
consumers are becoming more cautious.
   Before rising a weak 0.3 percent last month, personal consumption
spending, which includes everything except interest on debt, had
surged 1.1 percent in April and risen 0.4 percent in March.
   The Commerce Department said much of the May weakness and April
strength was accounted for by swings in auto buying, which have been
influenced by introduction of manufacturers' incentives in April and
their partial rescission in May.
   Spending on durable goods, big-ticket items including autos, fell
1.5 percent last month to an annual rate of $465.7 billion after
rising 4.4 percent in April.

<TEXT>
   Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp., its credit-reporting
subsidiary and lawyers for business customers Friday announced an
$18 million out-of-court settlement.
   The agreement would resolve five class-action suits, three in
Cincinnati and two in Philadelphia, involving between 30,000 and
50,000 customers who bought Dun &amp; Bradstreet Credit Services between
1983 and 1988, according to William Markowits, attorney for the
plaintiffs.
   Markowits said the actual number of defendants would be
determined in a series of hearings to be announced later.
   The suits involved claims that businesses were led to purchase
more credit services than they needed, Markowits said.
   Under the agreement, Dun &amp; Bradstreet said its salesmen would get
larger salaries as opposed to commissions, express its products and
services in dollar terms as well as unit terms, reduce the premium
over the discounted price charged customers who bought supplemental
units and provide customers with electronic access to current usage
information.
   Dun &amp; Bradstreet, however, denied any widespread liability or
wrongdoing.
   If more than 5 percent of the customers in the suits choose not
to participate in the settlement, Dun &amp; Bradstreet will have the
right to cancel the settlement.

<HEAD>FTC Approves Quaker Oatmeal Ads</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Quaker Oats Co. announced Friday that a federal
agency has determined ads touting its oat bran and oat-bran products
as an aid in reducing blood cholesterol levels are neither
misleading nor illegal.
   After a year-long investigation of the Quaker ads, the Federal
Trade Commission ruled that consumers understand that oat-bran
products can help cut cholesterol as part of a low-fat,
low-cholesterol diet.
   The probe was prompted by a complaint from the Center for Science
in the Public Interest in Washington, D.C., which contended Quaker's
ad campaign was misleading because it implied that cholesterol
levels could be reduced solely be eating Quaker Oats.
   The ads in question say:
   ``In recent clinical studies where Quaker Oats were a daily part
of a low-fat, low cholesterol diet, total serum cholesterol levels
dropped on average almost 10 percent. ... Many experts believe it is
the soluble fiber in oats that does it. And, scientists are finding
that oats are one of the best sources of soluble fiber you can get!''
   The center also questioned the use of ``almost 10 percent'' to
describe cholesterol reductions, saying the study from which the
Quaker got its information indicated the reduction averaged 8.7
percent.
   But William MacLeod, director of the FTC's Consumer Protection
Bureau wrote that the agency ``concluded that consumers who view the
advertising would attribute the reduction to a low-fat diet
including Quaker Oats.''
   In a letter to the center, McLeod said: ``This conclusion is
based on the actual reactions of consumers, as well as our analysis
of the ads themselves. Therefore, we do not believe that the
evidence would support the conclusions in your petition.''
   R. Thomas Howell, general counsel for Chicago-based Quaker, said,
``It has been our policy that any health-related advertising claims
should be truthful, not misleading and supported by valid, reliable,
scientific evidence.''
   Howell said Quaker supplied documentation on 10 studies conducted
during the past 25 years that show the positive effects of oats and
oat products.
   Despite the FTC finding, Quaker has advised the commission that
``they nonetheless plan to clarify the ads that prompted your
petition,'' MacLeod said in a letter to the center.
   Bruce Silverglade, the center's director of legal affairs, said
while the organization was pleased the company ``has voluntarily
modified the ads ... we still encourage state attorneys general who
are investigating the same advertising campaign to take official
action against Quaker.''
   ``The federal government is no longer the last word on these
matters,'' Silverglade said.
   He said until such changes are legally required, ``companies
often revert to the original ads in a few months time.''

<HEAD>Bond Prices Surge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices surged Friday in active trading,
boosted by new economic reports that pointed to a further easing of
inflationary pressures.
   The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond jumped about 1{
points, or $15 for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which
moves in the opposite direction from price, fell to 8.19 percent
from 8.32 percent late Thursday.
   Analysts said the bond market got a lift from three economic
reports released Friday suggesting the pace of economic growth is
continuing to slow.
   The Commerce Department reported that orders of durable goods, or
items expected to last three years or longer, plunged 4.2 percent
last month. American's personal income and consumer spending,
meanwhile, rose a lackluster 0.3 percent in May _ the smallest gains
in several months.
   ``The bond market took its direction from the durable goods
orders report,'' said Marshall Front, an economist at the Chicago
investment firm of Stein Roe &amp; Farnham. ``It supported the view that
the economy is indeed slowing down.''
   Although inflation continues to run at a healthy clip, the new
numbers suggest that a slowdown in economic growth will dampen
inflation, analysts said.
   Inflation erodes the value of fixed-income securities like bonds
and notes. An acceleration of inflation could also prompt the
Federal Reserve to tighten credit and encourage higher interest
rates, depressing bond prices.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
government issues rose 9-32 point to 9-16 point, intermediate
maturities advanced | point to 29-32 point, and 20-year issues
jumped 1\ points, according to Telerate Inc., a financial
information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, rose 8.15 to 1,175.19.
   In corporate trading, industrials also gained. Moody's Investment
Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures total return on a
portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or
longer, advanced 1.78 to 324.29.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds was 9329-32, up 3-16 from late Thursday. The
average yield to maturity was 7.34 percent, down from 7.36 percent.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 8.33 percent as the
discount dropped 8 basis points to 8.06 percent. Yields on six-month
bills slid to 8.38 percent as the discount tumbled 17 basis points
to 7.95 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to 8.39 percent as
the discount dropped 15 basis points to 7.81 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted late in the day at 9{ percent, down from 9|
percent late Thursday.

   The dollar was lower against the Japanese yen in
morning trading Friday, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange moved higher.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which lost 20.31
points Thursday, gained 192.07 points, or 0.57 percent, to finish
the morning session at 33,517.04.
   The dollar was trading at 140.15 yen at late morning. After
opening at 139.60 yen, down 1.80 yen from Thursday's close of 141.40
yen, the currency ranged between 139.40 yen and 140.60 yen.
   The dollar's drop followed its overnight plunge in New York,
where it closed lower at 139.30 yen following a false rumor that
President Bush had been shot.
   Traders said continued buying by Japanese importers and by
institutional investors helped the U.S. currency move back above 140
yen.
   Finance Minister Tatsuo Murayama told a news confernce Friday
morning that there is still specualtion in the currency market, but
said the market would appear to be ``in the process of deciding the
dollar's (direction).''
   In referring to last week's surge of the dollar past the 151 yen
level, Maruyama restated his belief that the dollar's recent
strength will be short-lived.
   On the stock exchange, dealers said the Nikkei index's gain was
partly based on a stronger yen and higher prices Thursday on Wall
Street.

   The Senate on Friday passed a
multibillion-dollar child-care plan but the Bush administration
labeled it ``a candidate for a veto'' despite Democratic compromises
to accommodate the president.
   The voice vote sent to the House a partisan fight over child
care, with Democrats and Republicans alike jockeying for credit on
an issue both parties have made a priority.
   Overall, the Senate package, with its $1.75 billion in direct
subsidies for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1and about $3 billion a
year in tax credits, represents the greatest government effort to
address child-care needs of working parents since an emergency plan
adopted during World War II.
   When GOP senators and the White House scoffed Friday morning at a
Democratic compromise it appeared a lengthy battle over amendments
was in store.
   But Republicans acknowledged their inability to muster enough
votes to defeat the majority Democrats and relented by midafternoon
to reach agreement on a timetable that allowed for the final vote in
time for senators to leave town to begin a two-week recess.
   Action on child care is expected to accelerate in the House
beginning next week, and Republicans made clear they wanted to
revise the Senate measure substantially.
   ``I'm going to encourage the administration not to view what
happened in the Senate as final,'' Senate Republican leader Bob Dole
of Kansas said just before the final vote. ``There's a long way to
go.''
   But Democrats characterized the legislation as historic and a
long-overdue effort to support low-income parents who want or need
to work but cannot find or afford child care. '
   ``The real winners, the children, are closer to a safer, more
effective and affordable child-care program,'' said Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass.
   ``This is a monumental achievement,'' said Republican Sen. Orrin
Hatch of Utah, who crossed party lines to co-sponsor the plan with
Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.
   Still, Dole said changes would be needed to win Bush's support.
   ``There's nothing in this bill for the president of the United
States,'' Dole said. ``He supports child care. He wants a bill he
can sign. But to get one you've got to give him something that he
wants.''
   Exasperated Democrats said they had done just that.
   An amendment by Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, added to the
Democrats' bill a tax credit the White House had sought. Bentsen
copied it from an alternative Republican child-care package defeated
Tuesday.
   Another Bush-supported provision already was included in the
Democratic package, as well as a third credit to help pay for
children's health insurance, which Bush opposes.
   The president also opposes the centerpiece of the Democratic
bill: a $1.75 billion authorization for direct subsidies to help
parents pay for child care and to help states improve the
availability and affordability of services.
   ``I offer this amendment in the spirit of compromise,'' Bentsen
said. ``The president of the United States can't have it all.''
   But as the Senate voted 54-45 along partisan lines in favor of
Bentsen's proposal, the White House served notice that adding
provisions Bush supports would not sway his opposition to the
legislation, the Act for Better Child Care.
   ``The ABC bill, in any combination, is a candidate for a veto,''
Bush spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   After failing to defeat Bentsen's proposal, Republicans offered
another amendment that would heave essentially repealed it,
signaling an escalated political fight with more than a dozen
amendments to come.
   But when Democrats again beat back the GOP effort, 53-44, the
confrontational mood gave way to businesslike though partisan
consideration of the remaining amendments.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell had promised to an unusual
Saturday session to finish the bill but that proved unnecessary.
   The new twist in Bentsen's amendment was an expansion of the
earned income tax credit to provide up to $750 a year in new tax
relief to low-income parents with children under 5.
   The proposal mirrored the central element of the defeated GOP
alternative, which had White House support.
   Already in the Democratic bill was a provision allowing
low-income parents to take advantage of the existing dependent care
tax credit up front by making it refundable _ paying cash to
families who are eligible for the credit but cannot take advantage
of it because they don't make enough to owe any federal taxes.
   Both Bush's and the Democrats' original proposal would have made
the dependent care credit 100 percent refundable. Bentsen's
amendment made it 90 percent refundable, a change he made to pay for
the expanded earned income credit without adding to the estimated $3
billion annual cost of the tax-relief portion of the bill.
   Republicans argued that the credit should remain 100 percent
refundable. They called for the elimination of the third part of the
Bentsen package, a credit of up to $500 a year to help pay for
children's health insurance.
