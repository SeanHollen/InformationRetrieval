<HEAD>Magazine Relies on Reader Loyalty to Pay Libel Bill</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Thousands of Britons, for whom life without Private
Eye is unthinkable, are digging into their pockets to rescue the
magazine from being bankrupted by a massive libel bill.
   The response to the $1 million award against Private Eye has
triggered an extraordinary display of reader loyalty. Contributions
totaled $80,000 by early August, according to editor Ian Hislop.
   On May 24 a jury ordered Private Eye to pay the record sum to
Sonia Sutcliffe, the estranged wife of mass murderer Peter
Sutcliffe, the so-called ``Yorkshire Ripper,'' for two articles
alleging that she tried to sell her story to newspapers. The
magazine also was ordered to pay court costs of $160,000.
   The award caused outcry, partly because it far outweighed the
damages paid by the state to families of Sutcliffe's 13 victims.
   Editor Hislop, 29, said: ``If this is justice then I'm a banana.
... I think this is very nearly the end of Private Eye. We cannot
possibly pay that amount of damages.''
   He then launched an appeal, hoping to get $5 from each of the
magazine's 210,000 readers.
   Private Eye's reader loyalty may seem unusual. But then, so is
Private Eye. Its semimonthly serving of news, gossip, opinion and
satire has kept it afloat with barely a change of format since its
birth in 1961, at the dawn of Swinging Sixties London.
   With its carefully cultivated air of shabbiness, it still looks
like something pasted together in a college basement _ which keeps
the street price low at 95 cents a copy. Its 32 pages carry little
advertising and it shows no political bias, savaging hypocrisy,
pomposity and wrongdoing wherever they appear.
   ``While other magazines poke fun at contemporary mores, Private
Eye pokes fun at real people,'' said Tony Loynes, publisher and
editor of the industry magazine U.K. Press Gazette.
   ``Their satire bites at the rich, the famous, the makers and the
shakers. It's wickedly satirical, even dangerously satirical.''
   Some Private Eye euphemisms, designed to avoid libel problems,
have entered the language, such as ``tired and emotional'' for
drunk. Lately it has been prominent in investigating the
controversial shooting deaths of three Irish terrorism suspects in
Gibraltar last year, and the procedures that caused a British ferry
to capsize off Belgium in 1987, with 193 lives lost.
   ``Street of Shame'' reports dark secrets from London's newsrooms.
``Heir of Sorrows'' chronicles Prince Charles' marriage as a tawdry
romantic serial. Book reviews invariably debunk the literary darling
of the day.
   Graydon Carter, editor of New York's Spy magazine, says his
publication owes its existence to Private Eye and its founding
editor, 51-year-old Richard Ingrams.
   ``Richard Ingrams was a guiding spirit and we've always
appreciated the sauciness and the great investigations,'' Carter
said in a telephone interview.
   Since the libel blow, each issue includes a page listing several
hundred donors, and the quirkier letters of support are printed.
   ``As a basic old-age pensioner hardly able to afford a new tire
for my 1939 pushbike, I have decided to drink water instead of beer
for the rest of July,'' wrote H.J. Anderson of Norfolk, who sent $8.
   An appeal of the libel verdict will be heard on Oct. 3. If the
award is reduced, Hislop says the donations will go to families of
Sutcliffe's victims.
   According to Loynes, readers who went through the British private
school network provide the magazine with high-ranking contacts in
business, politics and the bureaucracy.
   Journalists of the establishment media also use Private Eye to
publish stories their own papers won't touch, he said in an
interview, because ``Private Eye is prepared to take the risk to be
irresponsible.''
   Managing director David Cash told the Financial Times in May that
the magazine's profits were just $4,800 last year after making
provisions for libel damages and costs of about $800,000.
   Seventy percent of Private Eye shares are owned by comedian Peter
Cook, with smaller stakes owned by Cash and founder Ingrams, who
used to list his recreation in ``Who's Who'' as ``litigation.''
   Hislop succeeded Ingrams in 1986, long after the Sutcliffe item
appeared. Ironically, when Hislop took over one of his promises was
to reduce the number of libel suits draining Private Eye's coffers.

   The operator of a boarding home where an
87-year-old resident was mistaken for dead and nearly embalmed has
been charged with three counts of operating an unlicensed nursing
home.
   The charges filed against Robbie Caldwell are minor misdemeanors
and carry a maximum fine of $100, City Prosecutor Albert Stewart
said Thursday.
   A resident of the boarding home, Carrie Stringfellow, apparently
lost consciousness Aug. 5 and was mistaken for dead. She was
transported to a funeral home, where her murmurings startled a
mortician who was preparing to embalm her.
   Ms. Stringfellow, who is blind, was taken to Mercy Medical
Center. She was released from the hospital Wednesday and transferred
to a nursing home. Doctors said she apparently remembers nothing of
the events at the funeral home.

<HEAD>The Korean Airliner Disaster, Anglo-American Style</HEAD>

   The 1983 Korean Airlines disaster is returning to
television in an Anglo-American docudrama focusing on
behind-the-scenes political intrigue.
   ``Tailspin: Behind the Korean Airliner Tragedy'' recreates the
American political response to the Soviet downing on Aug. 31, 1983
of KAL Flight 007 in which 269 people were killed.
   The 90-minute film stars Chris Sarandon as John Lenczowski, then
Soviet affairs director for the National Security Council, and
Michael Murphy as Richard Burt, then the State Department's
assistant secretary for Soviet affairs.
   ``Tailspin'' will be aired Aug. 20 on cable TV's Home Box Office
as the first in a three-project partnership between HBO in the
United States and Granada Television in Britain. The trans-Atlantic
line-up includes producer John Smithson and director David Darlow,
who are British, and writer Brian Phelan, an Irishman. Besides
Sarandon and Murphy, the American cast includes Harris Yulin and
Michael Moriarty.
   In an on-set interview last December in London, producer Smithson
called the project ``a serious and intellectual work of the type you
don't often see on American TV.''
   In more than 150 hours of interviews with up to 60 people, some
claimed the downing was a deliberate, cold-blooded Soviet attack;
some that the airliner was on an espionage mission, and some that it
was all a tragic blunder. Missing American records fueled
allegations of a cover-up.
   ``Tailspin'' doesn't take sides. Smithson said it is interested
not in fixing blame but in examining the middle-level,
decision-making process in American government.
   In one scene, Sarandon, as Lenczowski, argues in a White House
boardroom about the wording of a speech President Reagan would later
deliver.
   ``We're interested in the political battle in Washington at the
time between the State Department and the NSC, the center and the
right,'' said Smithson.
   He said the emergence of a Soviet policy of glasnost, or
openness, made ``Tailspin'' a period piece with perceptions of the
Soviet Union as ``the evil empire'' soon to be outmoded.
   ``This is a curious piece of modern history, an entirely
pre-glasnost piece,'' said Smithson. ``It marks a turning-point
where we're beginning to see the softening of Ronald Reagan.''
   Director David Darlow said he intended the film to be ``an
international political thriller.''
   ``If we've succeeded, it will have a sort of `All the President's
Men' feel about it,'' said the director, referring to Alan Pakula's
acclaimed 1976 film about the Watergate conspiracy.
   In telling its story from the inside, Darlow distinguished his
film from ``Shootdown,'' the NBC TV-movie with Angela Lansbury that
aired last Nov. 28. That version examined the crises of the
outsiders _ families of the victims and others.
   ``Tailspin'' focuses, he said, on three groups: the hard-line
anti-Soviets, represented by Lenczowski; the middle ground,
represented by the State Department; and Pentagon officials who,
Darlow said, saw the incident as ``a gigantic screw-up by the
Soviets.''
   Sarandon, a 1975 Academy Award nominee for ``Dog Day Afternoon,''
came to the project directly from filming in Hungary. He had no time
to meet the real Lenczowski, now a strategic studies consultant at
the Council for Inter-American Security in Washington.
   But he thinks attitudes to the KAL tragedy have changed following
the U.S. downing of a civilian Iranian airliner in July, 1988.
   ``Since that was, as our government says, accidental, I think
Americans will be more open-minded over the shooting down of the
Korean airliner,'' Sarandon said.
   Bridget Potter, HBO's Senior Vice-President for Original
Programming, agreed, saying the later incident means the earlier one
``cannot be seen in isolation.''
   ``It can happen again,'' she said. ``Mistakes are going to be
made.''
   Potter said the HBO-Granada partnership had resulted in a truly
international style of TV that works for both British and U.S.
audiences.

<HEAD>Fraternity Eliminates Pledge Period, Spending on Alcohol</HEAD>

   ``Animal House'' is out and temperance in at Zeta
Beta Tau.
   The national fraternity next month becomes the first to eliminate
the traditional pledge period, that rugged rite of passage when
hazing can break both spirits and bones.
   ZBT, like others, also is cutting off fraternity spending on
alcohol.
   ``It's not easy to implement, it may be painful, but nevertheless
it's an idea which we felt should be followed through,'' said ZBT
executive director James E. Greer Jr., one of the movers behind the
decision.
   The rules are aimed at breaking the image of the stereotypical
fraternity house _ John Belushi-like lunacy, heavy drinking, random
abuse of pledges _ while keeping positive aspects such as bonding
and community service, Greer said Thursday.
   Zeta Beta Tau, which has 5,000 active members at more than 100
chapters in the U.S. and Canada, is the first national fraternity to
put an end to pledging. A dozen other national fraternities are
considering similar plans, said Jonathan Brant, director of the
National Interfraternity Conference.
   ``It's critical to eliminate hazing, and this is a viable
option,'' said Brant, whose group includes 59 national fraternities.
``We are supporting them, and hope through their success others will
learn the right lessons.''
   Potential ZBT members will be initiated as brothers within 72
hours of receiving their invitation to join, said Greer. Once in,
there will be a combination of orientation and education for the new
members rather than a torturous pledge period capped by ``Hell
Night.''
   ``We've had, as have other organizations, a continuation of
hazing incidents _ none life-threatening or severe, but we worry
about it,'' said Greer. ``We wanted to take the bull by the horns.''
   Greer said no single incident prompted the decision, but several
highly publicized incidents involving other fraternities have
focused attention on the organizations and hazing in the past two
years:
   _ A Rutgers University pledge died of alcohol poisoning after a
fraternity house party last year. James Callahan, 18, had a blood
alcohol level of 0.43 _ more than four times the legal limit.
   _ A pledge at the University of Lowell in Massachusetts was
stuffed in a sleeping bag while fraternity members turned on heaters
nearby. The pledge survived, but arrived at the hospital with a body
temperature of 109 degrees.
   _ A University of Delaware pledge charged in a lawsuit that a
corrosive oven cleaner was dumped on his head during ``Hell Night''
activities.
   ``The national fraternities don't like being identified as the
root cause of problems,'' said Greer. ``We have to find some answers
and remain on the cutting edge of solving problems.''
   While ZBT's Supreme Council unanimously approved the new policy,
Greer acknowledges response from its members _ both active and
alumni _ has not been uniformly positive.
   ``In the beginning, there was a lot of shock and denial and anger
that the national fraternity would do this,'' said Greer, a Class of
'64 ZBT at California State University at Long Branch.
   ``We've had letters and phone calls from alumni, calling this a
break with tradition, saying they don't understand what we're doing.
But overall, it's been far more positive than negative.''
   Greer said his organization knew it was risking a possible
fall-off in membership and dues this year, but was confident its
decision would quickly turn into a recruiting advantage for ZBT.
   ``We're dealing with a smarter, more savvy freshman. His parents
read the papers, they know what's going on with fraternities,'' said
Greer. ``Once we get past the initial anxiety, it'll be to our
advantage.''

   Gerber Products Co. is recalling some
shipments of Toasted Oat Rings because a new manufacturing process
made the cereal too hard for some children to swallow.
   ``The Food and Drug Administration has been notified ... and
removal of the product from retail store and wholesale grocer
warehouses is under way,'' said Ron Lovasz, vice president of
quality control for Gerber.
   Some parents reported their children had trouble swallowing the
rings, so the company voluntarily recalled 7-ounce packages of the
cereal with ``Better If Used By'' codes of 30MAY90 thorugh 15AUG90,
Gerber said Thursday.
   ``While the product's `donut' design provides an airway and no
injuries have been reported, our examination of more than 100
product samples indicate the reports may be related to a recent
change in the manufacturing process that rendered the product
crispier,'' Lovasz said.
   Consumers can return boxes of the cereal to stores for a refund,
Gerber said.

   Here are brief descriptions of the powers
and duties of the president and prime minister in Poland:
</TEXT>
<NOTE>PRESIDENT</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The president is the head of state and commander-in-chief of the
armed forces.
   Chosen by a joint vote of the Sejm and Senate, a president may
declare a state of war or a state of emergency when he judges that a
security threat exists, and rule for up to three months without the
consent of the Sejm, the lower house of parliament.
   He must ratify or consent to abrogate international agreements.
He also appoints and recalls ambassadors. He may veto legislation
passed by the Sejm, subject to a two-thirds majority override.
   He may dissolve parliament and call new elections in strictly
limited circumstances, for instance if parliament fails to choose a
government or pass a budget within three months of being seated, or
if parliament passes laws curtailing the president's powers.
   The presidency was restored this year after a 37-year absence.
Former Communist Party leader Wojciech Jaruzelski now holds the
office. The president serves a six-year term and may run once for
re-election.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>PRIME MINISTER</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The prime minister is the head of government.
   Nominated by the president and elected by a simple majority of
the Sejm, the prime minister assembles a Cabinet to direct the
activities of the government and runs the ministries that control
Poland's state-sector-dominated economy. The Cabinet must also be
approved by the Sejm.
   The prime minister is responsible for the day-to-day actions of
government and also drafts and proposes laws to the parliament.
Other duties include drafting annual budgets and national plans for
the economy.
   The prime minister leads the weekly meetings of the Cabinet,
known as the Council of Ministers, and controls all important
government personnel decisions.
   The prime minister serves for the four-year term of the Sejm,
unless he is recalled by the president and voted out of office by a
majority of the Sejm.

<TEXT>
   A man who held his wife and eight
children at gunpoint shot her to death and critically wounded
himself Thursday after a 6{-hour standoff in which he played Russian
roulette with the hostages, police said.
   Dang Cha Xiong, 35, identified as a refugee from Laos, was in
critical condition at a city hospital, authorities said.
   ``Apparently none of the children were injured,'' said police Lt.
Andy Jackson. He said Dang was under court order to stay away from
his family.
   Deputy police chief Lucien Neely said Dang told police he would
surrender, but police then heard shots inside the apartment.
Officers rushed the dwelling, finding the children unharmed in a
front room and the two wounded parents in a rear bedroom. The wife
was pronounced dead at Dameron Hospital in Stockton.
   Neely said the gunman apparently had played Russian roulette with
the hostages during the standoff. The identity of the woman was not
immediately avaailable, police said.
   A tenth hostage, a 12-year-old boy, escaped and reported the
incident to police about 2 p.m., Jackson said.
   A special weapons and tactics team went to the apartment and
attempted negotiations, but the gunman did not released the
hostages, Jackson said.
   Jackson said the man was armed, but did not specify the weapon.
He had threatened the children, but there was no indication anyone
had been harmed, Jackson said.
   The boy told police that Dang had played Russian roulette with
the hostages, apparently sticking a bullet in the cylinder of a
pistol and pulling the trigger.
   Seven of the eight children, between one and 13 years of age,
were Dang's, police said.
   A man with an assault rifle on Jan. 17 killed five children and
wounded 30 other people before killing himself in a schoolyard in
this city 75 miles east of San Francisco.

<HEAD>Fire Kitchen Cooks Savor Their Work</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   They don't see the firefighters they cook
for, but the women of the Salmon National Forest fire kitchen fuss
over every meal as if their favorite children were coming to dinner.
   During fire season, two crews of local women work round the
clock. Housed in the basement of the Bureau of Land
Management-Forest Service warehouse, the 20-by-30-foot kitchen can
prepare meals for 700, and the cooks have pushed the limit to more
than 1,000 when firefighters on lines in other parts of the state
are still waiting for their caterers to arrive.
   They cook in five- and ten-gallon pots and stir their concoctions
with ax handles. The meals are airlifted to the fire camps.
   Retired cook Evelyn Yakovac was on hand when the fire kitchen
opened more than 40 years ago.
   It was before the Forest Service used helicopters, so meals were
packed in five-gallon tins and parachuted into the camps. Mrs.
Yakovac recalls one fire in which the T-bone steaks they sent got
hung up in a tree and spoiled before the crews could get them down.
   The advent of helicopters and pickups helped improve things, she
said. It even meant they could send pies to the crews. After the
Corn Creek fire in 1961, Mrs. Yakovac went home and built enough pie
boxes to feed 180 people. They've been sending out pies ever since.
   Forest Service regulations now require a caterer for a fire camp
of more than 250, but the fire kitchen still finds itself busy,
serving smaller camps and picking up the caterers' slack.
   ``We do everything homemade here, everything from scratch,'' said
Virginia Perry, Mrs. Yakovac's daughter and a 34-year veteran who
serves as head cook for the five-person daytime crew.
   Their menus include such entrees as steak, chops, chicken, and
casseroles, plus a variety of salads and baked goods.
   A meal of stew and fruit salad for 700 requires 100 gallons of
stew, 50 gallons of fruit salad, 90 gallons of coffee, 70 gallons of
punch, and 18 gallons of milk.
   The women turn out meals for less than $10 a day for each
firefighter, Forest Service spokeswoman Eileen Havens said. In
contrast, the Forest Service this year paid caterers more than $28 a
day for each firefighter's meals.

   A Japanese television station selected seven

   The Tokyo Broadcasting System staffers will travel to the Soviet
Union for tests later this year, the company said Thursday.
   Two finalists will undergo 18 months training at Glavkosmos, the
Soviet space agency.
   The seven include two 23-year-old assistant directors, the
network's 42-year-old Moscow bureau chief and its 47-year-old deputy
foreign editor. Two of the candidates are women.
   The successful candidate will join a Soviet mission to the space
station Mir in late 1991 and will put together daily television and
radio broadcasts during the six-day trip.
   Three Japanese astronauts, including one woman, are currently
being trained by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space
Administration for a U.S. space mission scheduled for mid-1991.

desk, chances are he's in an airport, airliner or hotel.
   Leno substitutes for Johnny Carson 77 times a year on the NBC
talk show and does about 250 one-night shows a year around the
country.
   ``To go somewhere and stand onstage for an hour and talk is not
hard work,'' Leno said in the September issue of Cosmopolitan.
``Plus, your stand-up does begin to atrophy if you don't do it a
lot. If you start playing only in selected places, pretty soon you
lose touch.
   ``I've seen a few comedians who were funny fifteen years ago and
are still doing Nixon impressions and jokes about the women's
liberation movement.''
   Traveling, he says, is ``no big deal. I arrive in town in the
afternoon. The show is at 8 p.m., and I really don't have to be
there until 10 minutes before. There're only two questions: Where do
I stand? Is the microphone OK? No trucks jammed with equipment, no
female groupies. It's pretty basic.''

   Actress Jennifer Tilly, the fast-talking
ditzy gambler's girlfriend in the movie ``Let It Ride,'' says she
likes being one of Hollywood's busiest actresses, but would prefer
some meatier roles.
   Miss Tilly, sister of actress Meg Tilly, said she was on location
for the movie when the trade paper Daily Variety named her
Hollywood's busiest actress, with 11 films to her credit in the last
three years.
   ``I knew I worked a lot, but I was really surprised I was the
busiest,'' she said in a recent interview. ``Of course that kind of
statistic is pretty misleading. I do a lot of small character parts
while some other actresses with bigger roles work on them a year or
more.
   ``I don't think Meryl Streep called to complain that she wasn't
on the list.''
   It's the bigger roles that Tilly wants, away from the typecast
she believes she fell into when she was cast in several television
shows, including a six-show stint as a gangster's moll on ``Hill
Street Blues.''

   A judge has denied a request to lower bail for
one of three men from the entourage of rap musician LL Cool J
accused of raping a 15-year-old girl.
   Bodyguard Christopher Elias Tsipouras, 26, of Union, N.J., sought
on Thursday to have the bail lowered from $100,000 to $20,000.
   Assistant County Attorney Judy Johnston argued that Tsipouras
represents a danger to the community and would be unlikely to return
to the state for prosecution if he were set free on bail.
   Two other men accused in the rape, band technician Gary Chris
Saunders, 22, and singer David James Parker, 26, have not yet had
bail hearings.
   The alleged victim and a 16-year-old friend had received
backstage passes to the group's concert Aug. 9 in Bloomington and
later accompanied the group to a party.
   Sexual advances were made to the girls, and the 16-year-old left
the party, but the younger girl could not escape and eventually was
sexually assaulted by three men, police said.

   Baseball, of course, is an American as Mom and
apple pie. But salami?
   A delicatessen owner is offering a free, 1-pound kosher salami
worth $7 to anyone who can produce a ticket stub from a Mets game
won by pitcher Frank Viola.
   Average attendance at a Mets game is 37,300.
   ``If 40,000 people come to the deli, I don't have that many
salamis, but I am printing up rain checks,'' said Abe Lebewohl,
owner of the Second Avenue Deli. ``I was warned, `Abe, you're going
way over your head.'
   ``But look, these are challenges which make life interesting and
we'll see what we can do. Worse comes to worse, we'll give rain
checks.''
   Viola's parents, Frank Sr. and Helen, were regular customers
years ago when the elder Viola worked in Manhattan.
   They've since retired to Florida, but Lebewohl, who opened the
delicatessen 35 years ago, came up with the salami idea two weeks
ago when the couple stopped in to eat and wound up having their
picture taken by a New York Post photographer.
   Frank Viola joined the Mets recently from the Minnesota Twins.

<HEAD>NTSB Looking Into Possibility That Cracks Triggered Engine Breakup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The investigation of the United Airlines DC-10
crash in Sioux City, Iowa, is looking into whether the engine
breakup may have been triggered by cracks in its fan assembly,
officials say.
   However, no direct evidence of cracking has been found, officials
said Thursday.
   The National Transportation Safety Board disclosed that a routine
inspection of a General Electric CF6-6 engine on another McDonnell
Douglas DC-10 at United's maintenance facility in San Francisco
recently uncovered a number of small cracks on a flange component of
the fan assembly.
   The safety board cited the discovery in a letter to the Federal
Aviation Administration in which it urged the FAA to begin a special
investigation to determine how much stress the GE engine can
withstand before such components show signs of a problem, including
cracking.
   The board, however, made no recommendations that would
immediately affect the operation of any of the DC-10s being flown
with the CF6-6 engines. There are 124 DC-10s with that engine being
flown by U.S. airlines, most belonging to United and American
Airlines, the FAA said.
   United Flight 232 crashed July 19 as it tried to make an
emergency landing at the Sioux City, Iowa, airport, killing 111 of
the 296 people on board.
   The plane's No. 2 engine, located at the center tail section,
broke apart during flight. The breakup, in which much of the fan
rotor assembly separated, destroyed the jetliner's hydraulic control
system.
   The safety board emphasized that critical parts of the engine,
including front portions of the fan assembly where the cracking was
found in the engine in San Francisco, have not been found and are
presumed scattered across the Iowa countryside.
   Nevertheless, the board said it was concerned that cracks similar
to those found in San Francisco may have developed in other CF6-6
engines. If such cracks were allowed to progress to the point that
the fan flange were to fail, the agency said it could ``cause
catastrophic release of the (engine) fan section'' such as
apparently occurred aboard Flight 232.
   Anthony Broderick, acting FAA executive director, said in a
telephone interview that the FAA is aware of the cracks found in the
United engine in San Francisco.
   However, he disputed the theory that the cracks might be related
to the Iowa crash.
   ``They were not cracks related to stress ... or strain on parts.
... They are completely unrelated to the events in Sioux City,'' he
said, adding that the cracks appeared to have been caused by ``a
chemical corrosion process'' rather than metal fatigue.
   But Broderick said the FAA agreed with the NTSB recommendations
and that a review of CF6-6 engine performance was under way.
   The NTSB said the investigation of the CF6-6 engine should
include ``close scrutiny of the design, certification, manufacture,
inspection and maintenance of the fan section of the engine.''
   It also should include various tests to determine the ``life
limits'' of engine fan components so that inspection frequencies can
be established for those engine parts, the agency said.

   In the winner circles, these victors were
a shade above the others.
   The ``Miscellaneous Sun Tanning Tournament,'' held in this
seaside vacation resort Thursday, attracted competitors in
categories such as best tanned underarms, best left arm tan _ ``for
folks who drive a lot'' _ and the Count Dracula division, for those
who avoid the sun, said city publicist Mark Soifer.
   ``We had a very pale young man win that award,'' Soifer said of
13-year-old Sean Martin of Cheltenham, Pa. ``He uses a lot of
sunscreen.''
   The best overall tan went to a repeat winner: Carl ``Mr. White
Feet'' Savino of Ocean View. Savino, an avid gardener, wears work
shoes every day.
   Bare-headed competition for the Golden Dome Award was tight, said
Soifer, who dreamed up the categories.
   Anthony Scavillo of Williamstown took ``top'' honors for the
second year in a row, but an honorable mention went to 8-month-old
Mathew Bishop of Danbury, Conn.
   ``He had the cutest little bald head,'' Soifer said.

   Men are more likely than women to think about
sex while bicycling, and women are more likely than men to think
about cycling during sex, according to cyclists who told a magazine
the sport generally improves their sex lives.
   Sixty-six percent of the 1,675 respondents to a mail-in survey by
Bicycling magazine said they believed cycling has made them better
lovers, and 44 percent said it increased their sex drive, while 11
percent said it decreased.
   ``All this time you were logging your miles, this little sport
was becoming the hottest thing since naked volleyball,'' the
magazine said in its September issue, due on newsstands next week.
   Asked whether they thought about sex while cycling, 1,146 men, or
85 percent, said they did, while 234 women, or 77 percent,
acknowledged such thoughts. Asked whether they thought about cycling
during sex, 19 percent of the men and 23 percent of the women said
they did.

<HEAD>Death and Taxes _ Or is it Death of Tuxes?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Benjamin Franklin said nothing is certain but
death and taxes. To the Treasury Department nothing is as certain
either as the death of tuxes.
   The Department's Depreciation Analysis Division has issued what
is probably the first federal tuxedo study.
   It is contained in 54 pages, complete with tables, three
appendices, graphs and a bibliography.
   ``There are two major types of tuxedos: basic black tuxedos and
fashion tuxedos,'' the analysts inform us.
   ``Basic black tuxedos generally do not change in style, while
fashion tuxedos generally change in style from year to year,'' says
the Depreciation Analysis Division, a newcomer on the governmental
scene.
   ``The basic black tuxedo ceases to rent either because it is worn
out as a result of the multiple process of wearing and cleaning. ...
Fashion tuxedos are also susceptible to sudden unrepairable damage,
but usually go out of style or become obsolete before they
physically wear out.''
   The study was done to help determine the rate at which rental
establishments should depreciate their tuxedos for tax purposes. To
the tax man, depreciation is the process in which the owner of
property is allowed to deduct the yearly decrease in the value of
that property.
   According to the report, no matter how long a tuxedo may hang on
a rack in the back room, its economic life is only as long as
customers want to rent it.
   ``The principal findings of this study are that the equivalent
economic life of tuxedos held for rental is 1.9 years, while their
useful life, which measures the period of which they provide
service, is 3.7 years,'' the report says. ``If Congress were to
establish a separate asset class for tuxedos, Treasury would suggest
that a 2.0 year life be assigned to such class.''
   The department chose August for its report, perhaps to prove that
some government is around _ what with the president in Maine,
Congress scattered to the four winds and bureaucrats at the beach.
   ``The basic unit of input is the tuxedo jacket,'' says the
section on characteristics of the formal wear industry.
   ``The average rental includes the jacket, pants, cummerbund,
shirt, tie, and studs. ... Since pants usually wear out faster than
jackets, approximately one and a third pairs of pants are purchased
for each jacket.''
   The study notes that a set of tuxedos in a single style
``typically contains tuxedos in a wide range of sizes, some of which
may rent very frequently and others of which may rent hardly at
all.''
   ``The latter are nevertheless needed, because rentals are often
made to entire wedding parties and it is necessary to fit the entire
party in order to rent even a single tuxedo.''
   Under the heading ``useful life of tuxedos,'' the report to
Congress spells out the rental patterns reported for 199 styles of
tuxes.
   ``Most styles, 182 out of 199, had a useful life of approximately
three to five years,'' said the statisticians.
   They found that formal wear rental companies infrequently sell
used tuxedos.
   ``Industry representatives noted that before used tuxedos are
discarded, they may be spray painted, shredded, or their sleeves may
be cut off to prevent the tuxedos from being worn when their
appearance would no longer suggest elegance,'' the report says.
``There is thus little or no salvage value for retired tuxedos.''
   The tuxedo report is the first depreciation report issued by the
Depreciation Analysis Division. There is no mention of what the
second study might be.

<HEAD>Outlook Good for Poultry, Livestock Production</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most livestock and poultry producers appear to
have outdistanced the impact of last year's drought and rising feed
costs, according to Agriculture Department economists.
   ``Prospects remain positive for continued expansion of red meat
and poultry production as more favorable weather ... caused crop and
forage conditions to improve in most areas,'' the department's
Economic Research Service said Thursday.
   Looking ahead, the report said that total output of red meat and
poultry in 1990 is expected to increase 2 percent to 3 percent from
this year's record level, continuing the pace that began in 1982.
   ``Sharpest year-to-year increase will occur in the broiler and
turkey sectors, but fed beef production (from feedlots) also may
rise. Non-fed beef output probably will decline as herd expansion
accelerates, and pork production may slip about 1 percent after
increasing since 1986.''
   A rebound in crop production from last year's drought-shriveled
output ``is expected to result in lower feed costs'' as corn and
soybean prices drop below the levels of a year ago.
   ``Continued expansion in meat exports will soften price impacts
of record production,'' the report said. ``However, rising per
capita meat consumption in 1990, together with a slowing economy and
a lower rate of increase in consumer real incomes, should result in
only modest increase in red meat prices and declining poultry
prices.''
   Analysts said consumer prices of beef and pork may increase 1
percent to 3 percent next year. But because of sharp production
increases, retail prices of broilers may drop 8 percent to 20
percent, and turkey prices may decline 3 percent to 5 percent from
1989 averages.
   Improved returns for egg producers and prospects for lower feed
costs are expected to boost 1990 egg output 1 percent to 2 percent,
the report said. As a result, retail egg prices may decline 10
percent to 15 percent. Per capita egg consumption could rise for the
first time since 1979.
   Cattle producers indicated July 1 that herd expansion is
continuing, although slowed by drought in some areas.
   Beef cow inventories were up marginally for the second
consecutive year, and producers were holding 4 percent more beef
replacement heifers for possible expansion in 1990, according to the
July 1 figures.
   ``Current inventory estimates indicate that as feed prices
decline, feeder cattle supplies will be adequate to allow an
accelerated pace of herd expansion and increased fed cattle
marketings in 1990,'' the report said.
   In a related report Thursday, the USDA said the number of cattle
being fed for the slaughter market as of Aug. 1 in the seven major
beef states totaled 6.57 million head, down 4 percent from a year
ago and 2 percent below the level of two years ago.
   Marketings of fed cattle in July totaled 1.69 million head, down
4 percent from a year ago and 1 percent below two years ago.
   But the placement of new cattle and calves in fattening pens last
month was reported at 1.31 million head, up 5 percent from a year
ago and 3 percent more than two years ago.
   As of Aug. 1, feedlot inventories were smaller than a year
earlier in Arizona, Kansas, Nebraska and Texas. Only California and
Colorado feedlots showed increases, while those in Iowa were
reported unchanged.
   State feedlot cattle inventories are listed here for the seven
states, which account for about three-fourths of the nation's beef.
The first number is the number of cattle, in thousands, as of Aug.
1, and the second number is the percentage of a year earlier.

   China has bought U.S. corn for the first time
in almost two years, along with more wheat for delivery in the
marketing year that began June 1.
   The sales, disclosed Thursday by the Agriculture Department,
included 150,000 metric tons of corn and 100,000 tons of wheat. No
further details were announced.
   Although China has been buying U.S. wheat periodically, it was
the first purchase of corn since December 1987, officials said. In
that year, China bought 278,500 tons of corn.
   The latest wheat sales boosted to more than 3.48 million tons the
amount of U.S. wheat China has purchased for the 1989-90 season,
officials said. Last year's sales totaled 8.3 million tons, making
China the leading foreign market for American wheat farmers.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat or 39.4 bushels of corn. The 100,000 tons of wheat would be
about 3.67 million bushels, and the 150,000 tons of corn would be
about 5.91 million bushels.
   Wheat prices at the farm have averaged around $3.73 per bushel
nationally, according to USDA recent five-day market estimates. That
would make the sale worth about $14 million.
   Corn prices at about $2.26 per bushel would make the corn sale
worth about $13.4 million.

<HEAD>Checking Up on Doctors: Consumers Find Credentials Hard to Verify</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE DREYFOUS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumers looking for a reputable physician often
turn to the Yellow Pages, but researchers say verifying the
credentials advertised can be all but impossible.
   Confirming a doctor's education, specialty training,
certification and other background is frequently beyond the average
citizen's grasp, according to an article published Thursday in The
New England Journal of Medicine.
   ``It's very difficult in most communities in this country for
patients to get important facts about physicians they'd like to
consult,'' said Dr. Arnold S. Relman, the journal's editor in chief.
   The problem is that no straightforward directory is available to
the public and those who consult professional listings often find
them indecipherable.
   ``While trying to ascertain how physicians' credentials
corresponded to those they listed ... we encountered a veritable
obstacle course of inconsistent and illogical policies that
effectively deny information to the consumer,'' wrote Drs. Julia M.
Reade and Richard M. Ratzan, who conducted the informal survey.
   ``In conclusion, obtaining access to complete, up-to-date, and
verified information about physicians is all but impossible.''
   Like many consumers, Reade and Ratzan started their research by
thumbing through the Yellow Pages.
   They found Southern New England Telephone Co.'s listings were not
routinely corroborated and included a warning suggesting additional
consultation with a local medical association.
   The Hartford (Conn.) County Medical Association, which receives
about 20,000 similar inquiries annually, answered many of the
researchers' questions.
   But the process is rarely that simple, they reported.
   ``Many medical associations are too small, or are unwilling, to
commit the time and manpower needed to provide rigorous
verification, and they accept at face value whatever information the
physician supplies,'' according to the researchers.
   Reade is a psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital, Ratzan
an associate professor at the University of Connecticut School of
Medicine.
   Because physicians supply much of their own background
information, Relman said, patients may face medical fraud. Doctors
who need periodic re-certification in their specialities may skip
the exams or, if they fail to pass, not report the results, he said.
   To protect consumers ``organized medicine must ... take the
initiative and see that standardized directories about physicians be
provided and readily accessible to the public,'' said Relman, who
for more than a decade has pushed for an accessible consumer
directory.
   ``If I were sick and needed an operation I would want to know a
lot about the surgeon who was going to operate on me,'' Relman said.
``But if you're a lay person and don't have access to professional
sources of information it's rather difficult.''
   Tenacious consumers can track down the American Medical
Association's directory, but the guide uses complicated numerical
and letter codes in verifying information about a physician's year
and state of licensure, medical school and specialty-board
certification.
   Beyond that, no information is provided on advanced training.
   ``Thus, there is no way to distinguish between the self-styled
cardiologist with board certification in internal medicine alone and
the cardiologist who has board certification in that
sub-specialty,'' the doctors said.
   The researchers studied several other compendiums, including
how-to manuals spawned in the 1970s by the consumer movement, but
found similar gaps and obstacles in each case.
   State licensing boards agreed that the best way to remedy
patients' confusion would be to establish a carefully verified
directory, Reade and Razan reported.

<HEAD>Pentagon Looks Into Leaks of Spending Plans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal investigators are trying to determine
how defense contractors supposedly obtained secret budget documents
containing details on the military's spending plans for weapons.
   Although the inquiry has centered so far on the Boeing Co., a
major defense contractor, it is expected to extend to other defense
contractors, government officials familiar with the case said
Thursday.
   The investigation is being run by the Pentagon inspector
general's office and is separate from the 3-year-old ``Ill Wind''
investigation of bribery and influence-peddling in the awarding of
Defense Department contracts.
   The ``Ill Wind'' investigation conducted by the Justice
Department focused on the role of private consultants in obtaining
inside information about Pentagon contracts.
   The separate Boeing case became public Tuesday when Richard Lee
Fowler, a former Boeing official, was indicted by a federal grand
jury in suburban Alexandria, Va., on 39 counts of theft, conspiracy
and fraud. The charges stem from his alleged trafficking in
classified documents, according to the indictment.
   ``It's part of a continuing investigation by the Department of
Defense inspector general's office into how certain contractors and
their employees have illegally trafficked in classified documents,''
said one Pentagon official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
``How Fowler obtained these documents is the subject of further
investigation.''
   According to the 68-page indictment, Fowler, while he worked for
Boeing in Washington as a senior marketing analyst from 1978 to
1986, obtained hundreds of the Pentagon's most sensitive documents.
   Among those papers were Air Force and Navy directives on budget
proposals, along with the Defense Department's five-year plan,
according to the indictment.
   The five-year plan is closely held within the Pentagon because it
is the chief defense spending blueprint used by the secretary of
defense, Joint Chiefs of Staff and civilian service leaders in
making major budget decisions about weapons.
   In addition, Fowler received three National Security Council
decision directives signed by former President Reagan, the
indictment charged. Distribution of those documents is extremely
limited.
   The three documents dealt with the Strategic Defense Initiative,
a proposed shield against nuclear attack, the indictment said, but
it did not give more details.
   Although Fowler had a high-level security clearance, he didn't
have authorized access to those papers, the indictment said.
   Fowler refused to discuss the case. Contacted by telephone at his
suburban Virginia home, he said only, ``I do not wish to comment
whatsoever on any of this.''
   Fowler was fired by Boeing in September 1986, said Harold Carr, a
spokesman for the company in Seattle. The Wall Street Journal said
the firing was because investigators were looking at Fowler's
activities.
   Carr said Boeing is cooperating with the investigators.
   ``There has been a considerable number of requests for documents,
papers, records and so on,'' he said. ``We have provided those and
will continue to answer requests for them.''
   After obtaining the papers, Fowler passed them along to Boeing
officials and other, unnamed contractors, the indictment said. He
also allegedly obtained some documents that had been specifically
requested by Boeing officials.
   None of the other people under investigation are identified,
although the indictment said some of other alleged conspirators
created separate log books to keep Pentagon officials from knowing
that Boeing had the unauthorized classified documents. Boeing has
authority to handle certain classified documents because it is a
major defense contractor.

<HEAD>Navy Evaluating Latest Trident 2 Test Failure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The latest test failure of the Trident 2
missile isn't expected to affect plans to put the submarine-launched
weapon to sea next year, the Navy says.
   However, the admiral in charge of the Navy's newest and
reportedly most deadly weapon says he'll delay deployment if he has
to.
   A Trident 2 missile exploded Tuesday, seconds after being
launched from the nuclear submarine Tennessee about 200 miles off
the coast of Florida. It was the second such failure in three
undersea test firings.
   The three-stage Trident 2 is a more lethal version of the Trident
1, the heart of the Navy's nuclear deterrent. The new version, built
by the Lockheed Missiles &amp; Space Co., is almost twice as heavy as
its predecessor.
   The Trident 2, each of which costs $26.5 million, is to be
deployed in the 1990s aboard a new generation of submarines,
providing the sea-based leg of America's land, sea and air nuclear
forces.
   Until the test failures, the missile had been one of the Defense
Department's nuclear modernization programs to be mostly
problem-free, with 16 of 19 successful land launchings.
   In a statement released Thursday at the Pentagon, the Navy said
that despite the latest test failure ``no impact is presently
foreseen on the planned deployment of the USS Tennessee in early
1990.''
   The Tennessee is to be the first of nine submarines equipped to
carry 24 of the missiles.
   The statement said that problems with water pressures on the
missile appear to have caused electrical cables in the first-stage
motor to sever, triggering the missile's self-destruct order.
   Rear Adm. Kenneth C. Malley said in an interview published
Thursday in the New York Times that he's confident problems with the
missile will be resolved by the March 31 target date for deployment.
   ``If I have to slip the date again, I'll slip it again,'' said
Malley, who earlier delayed the target date by three months.
   The Navy told The Associated Press on Thursday that Malley was
not available for an interview, but it did confirm that his
statements to the Times were accurate.
   Malley told the newspaper that initial reports from Tuesday's
failed test indicated that engineers, despite computer simulations,
seriously underestimated the amount of pressure on the Trident.
   The missile, he said, ``is much larger than anything we've fired
before. ... We expected some extra pressure on the rear end of the
missile and its rocket nozzles, but not as much as we're seeing. It
turns out that the pressure and the aft load are much more severe
than was anticipated.''
   Asked if the failures were a result of a design error or a flaw
in the manufacturing, Malley said: ``The device was built to
specification. There is no question that it was designed the way it
was intended to be designed.''
   In a statement, the Navy said the submarine will undergo a
two-month ``shakedown'' at the Electric Boat docks in Groton, Conn.
During that time, ``evaluation and correction action for the test
failure will be conducted.''

   Depression robs people of the ability to function
more often than arthritis, ulcers, diabetes or high blood pressure,
according to researchers who say depression is taken much too
lightly.
   ``We've greatly underestimated up until now how disabling
depression is related to other chronic medical conditions,'' said
John E. Ware Jr., principal investigator in a study that questioned
11,242 outpatients in three cities.
   Depression proved at least as bad as emphysema or back problems
at limiting people in their physical functioning or causing them to
stay in bed, said the study, published in today's Journal of the
American Medical Association.
   The only two worse chronic conditions were heart pain and
advanced coronary artery disease, in terms of limiting activities
such as walking, dressing, bathing, climbing stairs or participating
in sports, the study found.
   ``The findings are very important,'' said Dr. Martin B. Keller, a
depression researcher and director of psychiatric research at
Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.
   Four percent of the U.S. population, or 9.9 million people,
suffer from major depression at some point in any given year, he
said.
   Millions more may have some depressive symptoms and may be
``highly treatable'' with anti-depressant medications, said Dr. John
Zajecka, clinical director of psychiatric treatment research at
Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center in Chicago.
   Depressed people sometimes give up jobs and lose spouses while
bouncing from doctor to doctor for years before being correctly
diagnosed and effectively treated, he said.
   Dr. Gerald Klerman, a depression researcher and psychiatry
professor at Cornell University Medical College in New York,
estimated that only about 20 percent of depressives are getting
treated.
   ``The majority suffer in silence or are misdiagnosed _ as having
tension, anxiety, personality disorder or weak character,'' he said.
   The study, coordinated by the RAND Corp. in Santa Monica, Calif.,
looked at adult patients in a variety of settings _ health
maintenance organizations, group medical practices and solo
practices _ in Los Angeles, Chicago and Boston.
   About half of the subjects studied suffered from either
depressive symptoms or one of eight chronic medical conditions _
high blood pressure, diabetes, advanced coronary heart disease,
heart pain, arthritis, back problems, lung problems or digestive
problems.
   More than one-fifth of the subjects _ a total of 2,467 people _
reported depressive symptoms, which they typically explained to
their doctors as feeling ``down in the dumps'' or chronically tired,
Ware said.
   Such patients experienced as much or more bodily pain and stayed
in bed as many or more days as patients with back, lung or digestive
problems, heart pain, high blood pressure or diabetes, the
researchers found.
   Only arthritis proved more painful and only advanced heart
disease caused more bed days, they said.
   In addition, patients with depressive symptoms reported
significantly less ability to function socially than those with any
of the chronic medical conditions, the researchers said.
   ``If the doctor ... is unable to come up with a certified
psychiatric diagosis, that doesn't mean the person can be ignored,''
said Ware, a research psychologist and senior scientist at New
England Medical Center Hospitals in Boston.
   Such patients ``have a tremendous unmet need and burden that
costs a lot from society's point of view, because they're not able
to function,'' he said.

   The new agency created by Congress to resolve
the savings and loan crisis is taking control of another six
thrifts, bringing the total under government control to 268 in 33
states.
   The Resolution Trust Corp. announced action Thursday against four
institutions in Texas and two in Illinois. The S&amp;Ls will remain open
during normal business hours and all deposits are protected up to
the government insurance limit of $100,000.
   The agency will look for buyers to take over the S&amp;Ls, or
determine whether depositors should be paid off and the institutions
closed.
   The six, and their assets at the end of March, are:
   _Security Savings and Loan Association, Peoria, Ill., $356
million.
   _Black Hawk Federal Savings and Loan Association, Rock Island,
Ill., $74 million.
   _Southside Savings and Loan Association, Austin, Texas, $48
million.
   _Hearne Building and Loan Association, Hearne, Texas, $28 million.
   _Guadalupe Savings and Loan Association, Kerrville, Texas, $28
million.
   _Taylorbanc Savings Association, Taylor, Texas, $127 million.
   The RTC, created by S&amp;L legislation signed by President Bush on
Aug. 9, last week sold the deposits of three small institutions to
healthy institutions and is preparing to resolve the cases of
additional thrifts.

<HEAD>`Nation's Icebox' Title Surrendered To International Falls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRASER, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a warm ending to a cold war, Fraser
surrendered the title ``Icebox of the Nation'' to International
Falls, Minn.
   Fraser Town Manager Clay Brown said Thursday the town trustees
voted 5-2 on Wednesday night to accept a $2,000 out-of-court
settlement offered by International Falls for sole use of the chilly
title.
   Both cities have spent thousands of dollars in litigation over
the title in the last two years, he said, adding that Fraser still
will be allowed to use it in Colorado.
   ``We don't have the dollars to continue the legal battle,'' said
Mayor C.B. Jensen. ``But in our hearts we still believe we are the
icebox of the nation.''
   International Falls uses the nickname to attract corporations to
its cold-weather testing grounds. Fraser's frigid reputation also
has attracted companies _ Zerex antifreeze and Malt-O-Meal cereal.
Fraser also is ``The Town Goodyear Put on Spikes.''
   ``The thing started out as a friendly wager and has gotten way
out of hand,'' said Brown. ``The board did this in part for the
people of Minnesota.''
   Part of the settlement calls for Fraser and International Falls
to become sister cities.
   ``We want to get on with this and promote our state,''
International Falls Mayor Jack Murray said Thursday. ``This will
help the economy of the small communities in Minnesota. Everything
has worked out for the best.''
   Fraser, a town of 470 about 60 miles northwest of Denver, said it
can document use of the phrase back to 1958, when tax dollars were
used to buy a sign for the town. International Falls, a city of
5,000 on the Canadian border, claimed it had the term printed on
hockey jerseys in 1955. Newspaper stories referred to Fraser by that
nickname in 1945.

<TEXT>
   Exxon Corp. is being sued by two environmental
groups that say the company should pay the full cost of repairing
environmental damage caused by the Valdez oil spill in Alaska's
Prince William Sound.
   The suit, filed Thursday in state Superior Court in Anchorage,
charges that Exxon was negligent in failing to prevent the March 24
spill.
   It also contends that Exxon and its six partners in the Alyeska
Pipeline Service Co., which runs the trans-Alaska oil pipeline,
fraudulently misrepresented their ability to prevent or control a
major spill.
   ``This lawsuit simply seeks to force those who caused the
unprecedented assault on the environment to pay to restore one of
the world's last reservoirs of natural beauty to its original,
unspoiled state,'' said the complaint by the National Wildlife
Federation and the Natural Resources Defense Council.
   Sharon Newsome, the wildlife federation's vice president for
resources conservation, told a news conference the suit
``complements and reinforces'' one filed Tuesday by Alaska seeking
to recover unspecified damages for losses from the spill.
   The suit by the environmental groups says Exxon should be forced
to finance a court-controlled fund to cover the cost of assessing
and repairing environmental damage in areas affected by the spill.
The money, which Ms. Newsome said would amount to ``billions,'' also
would be used to buy natural resources such as fish and wildlife to
compensate for ecological damage that cannot be repaired.
   Exxon spokeswoman Sarah Johnson said the company would not
comment on the suit until it had seen it.
   The suit says Exxon should pay for the establishment of an
independent group of scientists appointed by the Alaska court to
control and monitor the environmental restoration effort.
   The suit names each member of the Alyeska pipeline consortium:
Amerada Hess Pipeline Corp., Arco Pipe Line Co., BP Pipelines
(Alaska) Inc., Exxon Pipeline Co. Inc., Mobil Alaska Pipeline Co.
Inc., Phillips Alaska Pipeline Co. Inc. and Union Alaska Pipeline
Co. Inc. The consortium was responsible for the initial response to
the spill.

   Herbert Lee Richardson was executed in
Alabama's electric chair early Friday for the 1977 pipe-bomb killing
of an 11-year-old girl.
   Richardson was pronounced dead at 12:14 a.m.
   The U.S. Supreme Court refused Thursday to intervene in the case
after the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta upheld a
lower court's decision to reject a stay of execution.
   Gov. Guy Hunt earlier refused to grant clemency for Richardson,
who was married last week in a prison ceremony.
   Richardson, 43, was condemned to die in the electric chair at
Holman Prison for the murder of Rena Mae Callins, whose body was
blown apart on the porch of her home when she picked up a pipe-bomb
and it detonated.
   Richardson contended the device was not meant to explode, only to
scare the girl's family. The girl's aunt had broken off a
relationship with him shortly before the pipe-bomb was planted.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Varner of Montgomery, who rejected
Richardson's motion for a stay, said it is ``beyond the bounds of
reason ... to believe that a device which maimed and killed an
11-year-old child by exploding in her hands could be thought of ...
as not presenting a serious risk of harm.''
   ``I can't rest until he gets the chair,'' said Margie Callins,
the girl's mother.
   In Montgomery, Lucia Penland of the Alabama Prison Project said
Richardson ``was what most of us would call an all-around American
boy with a bright future before he went to Vietnam.''
   She also said, ``The terrible tragedy of Mrs. Callins and her
family cannot be understated.''
   Courts in recent weeks have rejected defense claims that
Richardson wrongly was denied a state-funded psychologist to show
that he possibly was suffering post-traumatic stress disorder
stemming from his Vietnam War experiences.
   Richardson was married Aug. 9 at Holman, prison system
spokeswoman Debbie Herbert said.
   ``They let him out of the cell to go into the visiting room and
she (the bride) was there along with some other guests and after the
prison chaplain married them, they had some cake and then he
returned to his cell,'' Mrs. Herbert said.
   The governor's press secretary, Terry Abbott, said that according
to the clemency plea, Richardson and his wife, Katie, met 3{ years
ago. ``He wrote a letter to her church, saying he listened to their
broadcast and she started visiting,'' Abbott said.
   The church was identified as El Bethel Primitive Baptist Church
in Mobile.

   A couple is going to have to drink a lot of
java between now and 1991 to redeem all the coupons they found in a
single can of coffee.
   Joyce and Dwight Spates recently found 254 discount coupons
totalling $101.60 in a 1-pound can of Sanka brand coffee.
   ``Joyce was making coffee for friends, and there was a coupon in
the first scoop out of a newly opened can, then another in the next
scoop until she had pulled out three or four coupons,'' Spates said
Thursday.
   They emptied the coffee into a bowl and ended up with half a can
of coffee and half a can of 40-cent coupons.
   Spates said he called the maker of Sanka to report the coupon
bonanza.
   ``I told the man who answered the phone at General Foods that we
don't usually drink Sanka coffee and asked him if all the cans have
this many coupons in them,'' Spates said.

   Former Marine Sgt. Clayton Lonetree, who
was court-martialed in the sex-for-secrets scandal at the U.S.
Embassy in Moscow, wants a federal court to pull copies of a book
about his case from stores and halt further publication.
   The former embassy guard said in a complaint filed Thursday in
U.S. District Court that the book, ``The Court-Martial of Clayton
Lonetree,'' is based on confidential information obtained by his
defense team and jeopardizes his appeal.
   The book was written by Lake Headley, a private investigator who
worked for Lonetree's defense at his 1987 court-martial. The book is
already available in some bookstores.
   The complaint also names publisher Henry Holt and Co., Inc., of
New York, and asks $100,000 in punitive damages.
   Murial Caplan, counsel for the publisher, said she couldn't
comment because she had not seen a copy of the complaint.
   Daniel E. Johnson, one of Lonetree's lawyers, said publishing
company officials told defense lawyers Wednesday that it would not
voluntarily withdraw copies of the book.
   Lonetree, stationed in Moscow in 1985 and 1986, was identified in
news accounts as having had an affair with a Soviet woman who
allegedly introduced him to a spy. That spy allegedly used his
relationship with Lonetree to obtain documents describing the layout
of the embassy.
   Lonetree, who says his defense team didn't fully inform him of
plea-bargain offers, is appealing the case to the Navy-Marine Corps
Court of Military Review.
   He was convicted of espionage in August 1987.

<HEAD>Earth Safe From Collision With Asteroid _ At Least For Now</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the third time this year, scientists
discovered an asteroid will fly relatively close to Earth, and while
there is no threat of collision, experts say such a disaster is
likely sometime in the future.
   ``While the new asteroid poses no immediate danger, in
astronomical terms it will be making a very close pass'' when it
comes within 2{ million miles of Earth about 8 p.m. PDT next
Thursday night, said planetary scientist Eleanor Helin, who
discovered the mile-wide hunk of rock.
   At 2{ million miles _ about 10 times the distance between the
Earth and the moon _ the asteroid designated 1989 PB ``will be one
of the very closest larger objects to pass the Earth this century,''
said Helin, a planetary scientist at the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.
   ``It's not going to hit us. Certainly there's no danger,''
astronomer Brian Marsden said by telephone from Cambridge, Mass.,
where he directs the International Astronomical Union's Central
Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams, an astronomy reporting agency.
   ``One doesn't want to worry people, but anything that's crossing
the orbit of the Earth stands a chance of hitting the Earth, but
it's much more likely to be later than sooner. I'm talking millions
of years,'' Marsden said Thursday.
   In March, asteroid 1989 FC _ no more than a half-mile in diameter
_ passed within a half million miles of Earth, but wasn't discovered
by astronomers until April. In June, a 2-mile-wide asteroid passed
about 8 million miles from Earth.
   Scientists have said that if 1989 FC had hit Earth, it would have
done so with the power of about 40 billion tons of TNT, or about
40,000 hydrogen bombs, enough to wipe out entire cities. Asteroid
1989 PB is about twice as large.
   Helin said the discovery of asteroids passing near Earth is
ominous because ``if we are finding two or three a year this close
to the Earth ... there is strong evidence of a sizable population of
these objects that can be devastating. It's the one we don't see
that's going to kill us.''
   She discovered asteroid 1989 PB on Aug. 9 in film taken on the
18-inch Schmidt telescope at Palomar Observatory northeast of San
Diego. Astronomers were quickly notified, but it wasn't until
Thursday that word of the discovery was made public by the South
Pasadena-based World Space Foundation, which helps finance searches
for near-Earth asteroids.
   ``We feel comfortable with the very low probability of any
serious impact during our lifetime, but there always remains that
slight possibility,'' said Robert Staehle, foundation president.
   Staehle said that in 30 to 50 years, humans may be able to land
spacecraft on any asteroid heading toward Earth and ``either put
some sort of explosives on it or perhaps deflect it using a solar
sail or some other propulsion technique.''
   Craters around the globe provide little doubt that asteroids
smacked into Earth in prehistoric times. Scientists have blamed a
comet exploding in Earth's atmosphere for a 1908 blast in Siberia
that devastated miles of uninhabited terrain and was heard thousands
of miles away.
   In recent years, many scientists have become convinced that
asteroids striking Earth caused some mass extinctions, including the
demise of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago. Other scientists,
however, blame extinctions on gradual climate change or massive
volcanic eruptions.
   Marsden said amateur astronomers may be able to see asteroid 1989
PB through telescopes by looking in the constellation Cassiopeia at
the time of its closest approach to Earth.
   The asteroid moves around the sun in an elliptical orbit that
ranges from inside of Venus' orbit to a bit outside Mars' orbit, he
said.

   AIDS has reached the 100,000-case milestone in the
United States less than two years after the deadly disease hit
50,000.
   The national Centers for Disease Control said that, through July,
102,621 cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome have been
reported in the United States. A total of 59,391, or 58 percent, of
those patients have already died.
   U.S. health officials estimate that between 1 million and 1.5
million Americans are infected with HIV, or human immunodeficiency
virus, the virus which causes AIDS. A study among homosexual or
bisexual males _ the largest risk group for AIDS _ suggests that up
to 99 percent of those infected will eventually develop the disease.
   As scientists have noted for years, since the disease was
discovered in 1981, the case count is growing at a faster pace with
the spread of the disease. Where the first 50,000 AIDS cases in the
United States were reported between 1981 and late 1987, the next
50,000 were reported in less than two years _ between December 1987
and July 1989.
   AIDS continues to occur increasingly among abusers of injectable
drugs. In the first six months of 1989, 23 percent of reported AIDS
patients were female or heterosexual male users of intravenous
drugs. The CDC said that compares with 18 percent among the cases
reported before 1985.
   Meanwhile, 56 percent of the cases reported in the first half of
this year were among homosexual or bisexual males, compared with 63
percent before 1985.
   Gay or bisexual men make up 60 percent of the 102,621 reported
AIDS cases. Twenty percent are IV drug abusers, and 7 percent are
both. Four percent are blamed on heterosexual contact.
   AIDS is transmitted through blood or body fluids, chiefly through
sex or the sharing of drug needles.

   More than 71,000 Americans a year die from
emphysema and bronchitis and similar chronic lung diseases _ the
vast majority from smoking _ and the West has the highest death
rate, U.S. health researchers say.
   The national Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday that
71,099 Americans died of emphysema, bronchitis and similar chronic
lung diseases in 1986, the latest year for which complete statistics
are available.
   CDC statisticians used information about the prevalence of
smoking and the risks of smoking to project that 82 percent of the
lung-disease deaths were attributable to smoking.
   The highest death rates were across the West, with the exception
of Utah and Hawaii. The CDC said the highest rate was in Wyoming,
with 49 such deaths per 100,000 people in 1986, significantly higher
than the national average of 29.5.
   Other states with the worst lung-disease death rates were
Kentucky, West Virginia and Maine.
   The lowest rates were in the upper Midwest, the
Texas-to-Mississippi belt and the middle Northeast. And the lowest
rate of all was in Hawaii, with 16.9 such deaths per 100,000.
   The higher rates in the West came despite a generally higher
prevalence of smokers in the East, the CDC said.
   But emphysema and bronchitis, like lung cancer, can take decades
to attack and kill smokers _ so today's death rates could reflect
smoking patterns of many years ago, or even migration by former
smokers to the West, the CDC said.
   ``What happens (with emphysema and bronchitis) is as it is with
lung cancer _ it's what you did a long time ago that affects your
current disease status,'' said Dr. Robert Hahn, a CDC specialist in
lung diseases.
   The CDC said the national mortality rate from lung diseases such
as bronchitis and emphysema, at 29.5 per 100,000 people, is up 33
percent from 1979, when the rate was about 22 deaths per 100,000.
   The rate has risen just 15 percent in males over that time but
has increased 80 percent in females _ reflective of a later move by
women to give up smoking, Hahn said.
   Although smoking by men peaked in the 1950s, smoking by women
didn't peak until the mid-1960s. He said their lung disease death
rates, therefore, continue to rise, reflecting their smoking habits
from three decades ago.
   ``Women still have rapidly rising rates, and we'll probably see
that for another 10 years,'' he said.
   The lung disease death rate, nonetheless, was 1.8 times as high
in men as in women in 1986. It also was 2.8 times higher for whites
than for blacks, the CDC said.
   The CDC also used information about smoking prevalence and
smoking cessation in each state to project geographic trends in
smoking-related deaths due to lung disease.
   Like the overall death rates, the highest smoking-related rates
were again generally found in the West, with lower numbers in the
East plus Hawaii and Utah.

   Former President Carter will serve as a neutral

   Carter announced Thursday that the talks between the government

Sept. 7 at the Carter Center of Emory University in Atlanta.
   He said the talks, which will last for several days, will lay the
groundwork for further negotiations toward ending the civil war in
Ethiopia.
   ``In the history of political affairs, the most significant
single step is the first meeting,'' Carter said by telephone from
his home in Plains. ``One of the things we hope to do is to provide
both sides with an understanding of one another that will lead to a
complete resolution of the longstanding conflict.''
   The Eritreans, who have been fighting with Ethiopia since 1961,
want independence, federation with Ethiopia or regional autonomy for
their northern province.
   Carter visited Ethiopia during a tour of Africa last month and
met with Ethiopian leader Mengistu Haile Mariam, who had announced
June 5 that his government was ready to meet with the Eritreans and
another rebel group, the Tigre People's Liberation Front, in the
presence of an international observer.
   The former president said at the time that he would act as
official mediator if both sides asked.
   Carter said Thursday he could not guess how long it might take
for a peace accord to be worked out. But he added, ``I would hope
not years because the war continues and the suffering continues.''
   Dayle Powell, a Carter Center fellow who works on conflict
resolution, said Mengistu and EPLF General Secretary Isaias Afwerki
would not be among those attending the Atlanta talks. She said the
names of the negotiators and the exact size of the negotiating teams
would not be made public.
   Carter praised both leaders for planning the talks and said he is
``convinced that each has a sincere commitment to achieving peace
for his people and desires a return to economic prosperity for the
region.''
   The Tigre People's Liberation Front was not included in the talks
because ``the demands or goals of the Tigre movement are quite
different from those of the Eritreans,'' Carter said. He said he
hoped the Ethiopian government would talk with that rebel group as
well.
   Thursday's announcement said both sides agreed that the Atlanta
talks would be announced publicly and that no preconditions would be
set by either party.
   Carter said the talks will be held under the auspices of the
International Negotiation Network, which is based at the Carter
Center and which offers third-party assistance to reduce world
conflicts.

<HEAD>Goldsmith, Unions Wage War of Words Over BAT Takeover</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sir James Goldsmith is taking up the cudgel
again against critics of his multibillion-dollar hostile takeover
bid for Britain's BAT Industries PLC, the world's largest tobacco
company, and its U.S. affiliates.
   Goldsmith, in a statement issued from London on Thursday, labeled
criticism by U.S. unions and Kentucky Gov. Wallace G. Wilkinson as
examples of ``extensive lobbying'' by U.S. tobacco interests.
   The Anglo-French financier last month launched a $21.6 billion
bid for the company along with British merchant banker Jacob
Rothschild and Australian investor Kerry Packer.
   In Washington on Thursday, union officials held a news conference
to charge that the takeover would jeopardize the jobs of 55,000
American workers.
   ``Where his takeovers have been successful, Goldsmith has
dismantled companies, sold off assets, closed down plants and raided
pension funds. In each case, workers have paid a heavy price,'' said
John DeConcini, president of the Bakery, Confectionery and Tobacco
Workers International Union.
   Also Thursday, Wilkinson met with BAT chairman Patrick Sheehy in
London to offer his help in thwarting the takeover.
   Wilkinson said he expressed concern about the impact of a
takeover on the 1,500 Kentuckians who work for BAT subsidiaries as
well as on 100,000 Kentucky tobacco farmers.
   BAT's U.S. subsidiary, Louisville, Ky.-based BATUS Inc., oversees
Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., which employs more than 5,000
people.
   Goldsmith, meanwhile, reiterated earlier statements that among
U.S. companies he has acquired, ``there are presently significantly
more people employed in the aggregate than prior to the time of the
acquisition.''
   The cashless offer for BAT by Hoylake Investments Ltd. would be
financed largely through money borrowed against the concern's
existing assets, known as a leveraged buyout.
   The group has said it intends to sell the non-tobacco businesses
of BAT, which also has significant interests in financial services,
paper and retailing _ including such U.S. holdings as Saks Fifth
Avenue and Marshall Field department stores and Farmers Insurance
Group.
   Union officials concede there is no absolute proof a Goldsmith
takeover would result in layoffs, but Rudy Oswald of the AFL-CIO
said Thursday that corporate mergers, takeovers and leveraged
buyouts have cost more than 90,000 union workers their jobs since
1980.
   Union officials listed 30 such corporate actions _ including
Goldsmith's aborted 1986 bid for Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. and
his successful takeover of the James River paper company in 1985 _
they say cost thousands their jobs.
   The list included BATUS' closing of the Gimbels department store
chain, which union officials said cost 5,000 jobs.
   Goldsmith said in his statement that the only jobs at risk under
his BAT takeover proposal were those held by senior company
officials in London.
   More than 200 members of Congress last week signed a letter
urging Secretary of State James A. Baker III to express concern to
the British government about the multinational leveraged buyout.

   Two men sitting in metal lounge chairs
were struck and killed by lightning at the Sardis Lake dam,
officials said.
   Panola County Medical Examiner Clyde Cobb said efforts to revive
the men Thursday afternoon failed. Killed were Jeffrey L. Russell,
25, and James N. Mauney Jr., 29, both of Batesville.
   ``From the investigation that I've been able to do so far, they
were apparently laying out on metal lounge chairs and so they were
grounded with the metal,'' said Ms. Cobb. ``I don't know why they
stayed out there because there was a pretty bad cloud coming up.''
   Delbert Hearn, owner of Hearn's Trading Post, across the lake's
spillway from where the two were killed, said the storm that
produced the lightning was severe. He said the lightning struck
before the storm.
   ``It wasn't even raining yet. We could hear the thunder in the
distance,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A man was sentenced to life in prison for killing
his barber because he was dissatisfied with an $8 haircut.
   Paul W. Williams, 34, was found guilty of murder and two counts
of menancing Thursday by a Denver District Court jury. He was
convicted in the death of Bobbie Willis, 47, proprietor of Barber
Bob's Barber Shop.
   ``People don't kill someone over a haircut in this country,''
Judge Robert Hyatt told Williams before delivering the sentence.
``But I'm convinced that is exactly what you did.''
   Hyatt noted Williams' two previous felony convictions, one for
armed robbery and the other for burglary, and three misdemeanors.
   ``You must have such an explosive temper that you are literally
unable to control it,'' the judge said.
   Eight witnesses testified they watched Williams angrily confront
Willis in the barber shop last Dec. 17. Two of the witnesses, shop
employees, said they saw Williams shoot Willis.
   They said Williams became extremely angry at Willis after he
claimed the barber botched his haircut by exposing a scar on the
back of Williams' head. They said Williams vowed to return to the
shop and get even.

<NOTE>FAA Seeking $240,000 From Texas Company</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration is accusing
a Texas company of improperly shipping hazardous materials on a
passenger jet and says it is seeking a record $240,000 in penalties.
   The FAA on Thursday said a shipment of chemicals by Textile
Treatments International of Austin resulted in a cargo-hold fire
that forced the pilot to order an emergency evacuation when the
plane landed in Nashville, Tenn. Several passengers and flight crew
members were injured.
   ``We consider this a very serious incident,'' said FAA spokesman
John Leyden. ``This is the largest fine we've ever asked for in a
hazardous materials case.''
   Hugh Lowe, an attorney representing the company, said it would
contest the proposed fines.
   Leyden said the company's options include paying the fine or
asking for a hearing before an administrative law judge at the
Department of Transportation. Should the company refuse to pay,
government attorneys could file suit in federal court.
   According to the FAA, the Austin firm violated federal rules on
both labeling and packaging of hazardous chemicals used for
``stone-washing'' fabric. Included was five gallons of a hydrogen
peroxide solution banned from passenger and cargo-only flights.

<NOTE>EPA Accused of Contributing to Air Pollution</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An environmental group has accused the
Environmental Protection Agency of contributing to increased air
pollution by promoting the burning of toxic wastes.
   The National Toxics Campaign Fund, a private organization that
focuses on toxic pollution issues, said at a news conference outside
the agency's headquarters Thursday that EPA's policies will
``encourage more toxic waste production.''
   The EPA issued a statement saying the group ``seriously
distorts'' the agency's role in the disposal of such wastes.
   ``The only thing we're prompting is waste reduction,'' said EPA
spokeswoman Robin Woods. ``We're encouraging (states) to consider
all waste reduction opportunities. Secondly we're looking at them to
look at existing (disposal) facilities out of state. And as a last
resort build new facilities.''
   She said that the EPA requires strict emission controls when
toxic wastes are burned.
   The environmental group said the EPA does not focus enough in
getting companies and industrial plants to invest in technology that
would reduce toxic emissions.
   Instead, the critics maintained, agency policy requires state and
local officials to develop new toxic disposal facilities such as
additional landfills or incinerators.

   Le Thanh Nghi, former vice president of
Vietnam, has died at the age of 78, Hanoi Radio reported.
   The report, monitored in Bangkok, said Nghi died Wednesday.
   ``The party and state did everything possible to care for him,
but due to his old age and serious illness, Mr. Le Thanh Nghi passed
away,'' said the report, broadcast Thursday.
   Nghi, a former worker in a coal mine and a power plant in
northern Vietnam, joined the Vietnam Young Revolutionary Comrades
Association in 1929.
   He was arrested three times by the French colonial administration
for his communist activities and served two jail terms, from 1930-36
and 1940-45.
   He later rose to become secretary of the Central Committee of
Vietnam's Communist Party, a Politburo member, a vice premier and
the vice president of the State Council. Nghi also was awarded the
Gold Star order, Vietnam's highest honor, according to the radio
report.
   It said a wreath-laying ceremony will be held Saturday and that
burial was scheduled for Sunday.

<TEXT>
   Leaders of an American Indian coalition
say they're haunted by the image of their ancestors' remains stored
in boxes in museums and universities. They want them returned for
burial.
   ``We're asking that they bring them back to their lands, their
natural resting place. That's what they deserve,'' says Delfino
Begay, governor of Laguna Pueblo in New Mexico.
   The National Congress of American Indians, meeting in Albuquerque
this week, estimates the bones of 2.5 million Indians are held in
public and private collections nationwide. Museum spokesmen dispute
the figure, estimating institutions hold the remains of 100,000 to
250,000.
   One of the largest collections is at the Smithsonian Institution
in Washington, D.C., which says it has 18,600 such remains, stacked
in boxes in a hallway closed to the public.
   The Smithsonian, along with a number of other museums and
universities, is studying the bones to learn more about the bone
structure, diseases and lifestyles of American Indians of more than
a century ago.
   The Indian leaders, representing about 20 tribes at conference,
want the remains returned now, or at the very least, when the
studies are completed.
   Some say they have nightmares about the unburied dead.
   ``You really don't get the feeling of the Smithsonian ... until
you get there and see the boxes upon boxes in the hallway,'' said
Lawrence Kenmill, a member of the Salish-Kootenay Tribal Council
from Pablo, Mont.
   ``You get all kinds of feelings put together. You're sad, you're
hurt, you're angry. You get them all at once when you're looking at
it.''
   The delegates agreed the situation has improved in the past 10
years, with new laws protecting disposition of newly unearthed
remains. Some institutions also have returned bones.
   Last week, for instance, about 1,200 pounds of prehistoric
remains of members of the Seminole Tribe were reburied at Wounded
Knee, S.D., after being stored at the University of South Dakota for
the past three years.
   The remains had been unearthed at a construction site near Tampa,
Fla. Their new gravesite will become part of the National Indian
Cemetery.
   The Smithsonian also recently returned remains of 16 Blackfeet
that were improperly taken from a Blackfeet cemetery, and the
University of Tennessee repatriated 190 Cherokee remains exhumed in
1967.
   But the Indian leaders point out the returned remains are a small
fraction of what is being held. They are particularly concerned with
older bones, including skulls taken for cranial studies by the U.S.
Army Medical Corps during the Civil War and wars with Indians.
   Smithsonian spokeswoman Madeleine Jacobs said comparative studies
are still being done on the skulls. She also said the Smithsonian
was evaluating its policy of holding onto the remains.
   ``Our goal is to come to an accommodation with them,'' she said
of discussions with Indian groups. ``I think we all feel there is a
solution.'' Other large collections are at the Field Museum in
Chicago, the Peabody at Harvard University, the University of
California and the American Museum of Natural History in New York.
   Researchers say they are reluctant to relinquish the remains
because of recent breakthroughs.
   Harold Voris, the Field's vice president of collections and
research, said DNA fingerprinting has revealed a wealth of
information from the bones.
   ``It may help find the kinds of illness people were prone to,''
he said. Ms. Jacobs said researchers have learned that rheumatoid
arthritis is more prevalent in Indians than in the general
population.
   And Dr. Jefferson Chapman, curator of archaeology at the McClung
Museum in Knoxville, Tenn., said the University of Tennessee's 5,500
remains are now being used for research of spina bifida, a defect
characterized by imperfect closure of part of the spine.
   ``There are so many new things coming out, and who knows what
else will come along,'' Chapman said.

   A $65 million Navstar navigation
satellite rocketed into orbit early today, a half hour after liftoff
from Cape Canaveral.
   A three-stage Delta 2 rocket blazed away from its launch pad at
1:58 a.m. and left a fiery trail in the sky as it sped over the
Atlantic Ocean and climbed toward space.
   The Air Force reported 30 minutes after liftoff that the
128-foot-tall rocket had performed flawlessly and had propelled the
satellite into an initial elliptical orbit ranging from about 100 to
11,000 miles above the Earth.
   ``The Delta 2 has put its payload into a successful orbit,'' said
Lt. Col. Ron Rand, the launch control center commentator.
   On Sunday, ground controllers will command an on-board motor to
fire to shift the satellite into a circular orbit about 11,000 miles
up.
   The $30 million Delta rocket carried a Navstar Global Positioning
System Satellite, the third in a new series of spacecraft which
enable military units such as aircraft, ships, submarines, tanks and
field troops to determine their location within 50 feet and in some
cases to within 10 feet.
   The satellites, effective in any kind of weather, also keep track
of military units' speed within a fraction of a mile per hour and
the precise time within a millionth of a second.
   Each 3,675-pound Navstar contains an atomic clock with an error
rate of one second every 300,000 years.
   American and allied military users receive information from a
coded channel. Civilian users, also with access to the satellite
system, would monitor an open channel providing them with less
accurate position information within 300 feet.
   The satellite launched today is the third of 21 upgraded Block 2
Navstars that the Air Force plans to orbit to complete a global
system by 1992. The first two were launched in February and June.
   Seven earlier Block 1 Navstars also are orbiting the Earth. The
new model has more power and improved systems and has added the
coded military channel.

   The State Administration of Foreign Exchange recorded an
increase, however, in China's foreign currency reserves, excluding
gold, to $17.3 billion from $15.2 billion in 1987, the China Daily
said.
   The report said China posted a $7.13 billion surplus in its
capital accounts, including direct investment and international
loans.
   The $3.8 billion deficit in the current account, which includes
trade and tourism, was largely due to a doubling of the nation's
trade deficit because of sluggish export growth and soaring imports,
it said.
   According to International Monetary Fund accounting procedures,
China's exports in 1988 totaled $41 billion, up 18.2 percent over
1987, while its imports grew 27.4 percent to $46.3 billion, the
report said.
   The resulting $5.3 billion trade deficit was double that of 1987,
the report said.
   China's Customs Administration on Thursday reported a $700
million trade deficit for July, the official Xinhua News Agency said.
   The nation's import growth slowed from 37.7 percent in June to 16
percent in July. Imports totaled $5.18 billion, while exports grew
0.1 percent over June to $4.4 billion, the Customs Administration
said.
   From January to June, China posted a trade deficit of $5.79
billion, up from $1.22 billion in the first half of 1988, according
to Customs statistics.

<HEAD>Chicago Symphony Reaches Out to Black Audience</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES WEBB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chicago Symphony Orchestra, which has
performed to acclaim worldwide, will be leaving for Europe again
next week, but first it will try to win over a new audience at home.
   Its performances this weekend at a black, South Side church are
aimed at dispelling the notion that symphony concerts are white,
elitist events.
   Michael Morgan, the black assistant conductor who put the show
together says the idea of the concerts _ during which he'll direct a
symphony by a celebrated black composer, as well as several black
soloists _ is to establish a ``two-way flow'' between the orchestra
and the black community.
   ``We certainly want to include as many parts and ethnic groups in
the city as we can,'' Morgan said. ``We start in the black community
because of the misconception that there is no interest in the black
community in this sort of music.''
   Morgan said he still encounters ``the attitude that Orchestra
Hall concerts are white, elitist events, and that members of the
black community aren't really welcome ... that's not true.''
   The orchestra rarely performs outside of Orchestra Hall or its
summer home in the northern suburbs. It first reached out to the
city's South Side with an outdoor concert in 1987, but the
rain-marred Memorial Day event was a bust that drew few spectators.
   Then came the chance to perform tonight and Saturday at Christ
Universal Temple, a relatively new church that seats nearly 4,000
and boasts the talented Christ Universal Temple Ensemble _ a
90-voice choir that performed with the Chicago Symphony Choir in
April.
   ``Blacks do not historically come to hear a symphony _ they may
be fans of classical music, but they don't come to Orchestra Hall to
hear a symphony,'' said Joyce Idema, an orchestra spokeswoman. ``We
thought that this was a wonderful opportunity to go to them.''
   Morgan said he will direct the Symphony No. 1, the
``Afro-American'' symphony written in 1930 by William Grant Still,
the first widely played black composer.
   Black vocal soloists Geraldine McMillian and Ben Holt will
perform songs by Richard Strauss, and the temple ensemble will
perform an excerpt from a Brahms requiem as well as spirituals ``to
show the roots of the whole process,'' Morgan said.
   A native of Washington, D.C., Morgan studied in Vienna and has
performed as a guest conductor with major opera companies and
symphony orchestras in the United States and abroad before joining
the Chicago symphony in 1986.
   Still, he is one of the few black artists working in the upper
levels of a major symphony. Morgan noted there are still no
full-time black instrumentalists with the Chicago symphony.
   Tonight's sold-out concert and a second performance for young
people on Saturday are a chance to start to change that, he said.
   ``It falls upon us now to start to see that students from the
various minority communities have early enough exposure and
sufficient training to be ready to pass the rather arduous audition
process'' for a major symphony, said the 31-year-old Morgan.
   Keith King, a black, 15-year-old Chicago high school student,
will be a featured soloist in the Glazunov Saxophone Concerto at
Saturday's performance.
   ``To see this young black man ... hopefully will be very
inspirational to the young black people,'' said the Rev. Robert
Mayes, who writes much of the music for the temple ensemble.
   King, who aspires to be a classical saxophonist with a major
orchestra someday, shares the message Morgan hopes to carry.
   `I think it will show people that classical music is not really
for a certain type of crowd _ everyone can enjoy it,'' he said.

   The dollar firmed against the yen Friday, while
share prices declined in slow trading.
   The dollar opened at 143.50 yen, and ranged between 143.05 and
143.58 yen. It closed at 143.58 yen, up 1.20 yen from its 142.32-yen
finish Thursday.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average,
which had gained 5.96 points Thursday, shed 26.97 points, or 0.08
percent, closing at 35,063.14 points.
   The index fell in thin trading as the majority of institutional
and foreign investors avoided buying and stepped off to the
sidelines, dealers said.
   ``Because the dollar-yen rate is now at a turning point,
investors were reluctant to make major moves, which made trading
directionless and thin,'' said a dealer with Nomura Securities,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   In currency dealings, traders attributed the dollar's higher
opening to a smaller-than-expected U.S. trade deficit released
Thursday, which triggered dollar-buying in New York.
   The U.S. trade deficit fell to $8.2 billion, down by 18.9 percent
from the previous month's $10.1 billion.
   Traders said some market players sold off to take profits after
the dollar's jump in New York.
   But they predicted a yen rise because of investors' expectations
the U.S. economy is growing and the nation's monetary policy would
not be relaxed further.
   Toru Kanai, foreign exchange analyst with New Japan Securities,
Co. said the dollar in Tokyo inched down due to fears for the
dollar-selling intervention by central banks and concerns over a
release of the U.S. consumer price index for July, scheduled for
later Friday.

<TEXT>
   The state of Minnesota has a triple
standard on premarital sex, says the lawyer for a man appealing a
finding of discrimination for refusing to rent to an unmarried
couple.
   James Anderson, who represented Marshall area resident Layle
French before the state Court of Appeals on Thursday, said the
state's fornication law is in conflict with a law that gives
unmarried couples the right to housing.
   Furthermore, he said, the state university system forbids couples
to cohabitate in dormitories _ an apparent violation of the
anti-discrimination law ordinary landlords must follow, Anderson
told the three-member panel.
   ``I don't see how they can have it both ways,'' he said.
   Hundreds of supporters of French, a carpenter, have turned out
for rallies throughout the state. In addition, petitions and letters
of encouragement have arrived from around the country, including one
from a group of about 40 Jewish Orthodox believers in the New York
City borough of Brooklyn, Anderson said.
   About 400 people from around the country have contributed $1 each
to a defense fund for French, which includes another $2,000 from
larger contributors, Anderson said.
   ``All discrimination is not bad,'' Anderson said. ``Layle's
discriminating against what many people view as immoral _
fornication.''
   Andrea Mitau Kircher, an assistant state attorney general,
countered Anderson's argument by saying the state university system
may be subject to different laws than ordinary landlords. She also
said the state's fornication law is possibly in violation of the
state Constitution and has been raised unsuccessfully as a defense
in similar cases.
   ``Landlords can't make rental decisions on the basis of marital
status,'' Kircher said.
   ``Living-in-sin'' issues are in legal flux elsewhere in the
United States:
   _In Denver, the City Council voted 7-6 in May to revoke a
living-in-sin ordinance that prohibited unmarried people from living
together.
   _In Massachusetts, three couples filed a lawsuit five years ago
charging they were illegally barred from public housing in Worcester
because they were unmarried. State law, like the one in Minnesota,
prohibits discrimination on the basis of marital status. A
commission and court have ruled in their favor, and the case is
pending before a state appeals court.
   In the Minnesota case, French agreed in February 1988 to rent his
former house in Marshall to Sue Parsons. But he said he quickly
changed his mind and returned her damage deposit after he decided it
would be against his religious beliefs. Parsons had told French she
would be living with her fiance. The two are now married.
   French said he is willing to pay the woman $348 in damages she
sustained by having to change her rental plans, but he refuses to
pay a $700 civil penalty imposed by an administrative law judge who
ruled June 7 that French violated the state's anti-discrimination
law.
   The appeals panel said it would rule within 90 days.

<HEAD>Assembly Race Seen as Political Weather Vane</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Election officials guarded polling
places today during balloting for a National Assembly seat in a
Seoul race that is viewed as a test of support for the governing
party.
   There were six candidates, including one sponsored by dissident
groups. Political analysts said the race was too close to call and
officials results were not expected until Saturday.
   The District Election Management Committee, already concerned
with charges of illegal campaigning, said today more than 100
election officials were stationed at polling places to guard against
violence and election fraud.
   President Roh Tae-woo of the Democratic Justice Party sent a
letter to party members in the district urging support for Rha
Woong-bae, a former deputy prime minister. Roh called the race ``a
litmus test which would determine the course the nation would take.''
   Kim Dae-jung, head of the largest opposition party, the Party for
Peace and Democracy, said the election was a midterm appraisal of
the government and predicted voters would side with the opposition.
Lee Yong-hee, a three-term lawmaker, is that party's candidate.
   The Yongdungpo district in southwestern Seoul is seen as a
microcosm of Korean political thinking. The district includes urban
middle-class workers, and laborers and because many of the voters
are newcomers to Seoul it reflects the regional antagonism in Korean
politics.
   In the last election, the winning candidate and two opposition
candidates were within 551 votes of each other. Election officials
say there are 168,812 registered voters in the district.
   Today's election was called after the Supreme Court ruled in May
that the 1988 election of governing party candidate Kim Myung-sup
was null and void because of illegal campaigning. Kim is not running.
   Charges of unfair campaigning have been widespread and include
vote buying, distribution of illegal materials, slander and illegal
meetings.
   On Thursday, the Central Election Management Committee ruled Roh
violated the law by sending letters to non-party members asking
voters to support the Democratic Justice Party candidate.
   The other candidates are Lee Won-bum, a former lawmaker from the
Reunification Democratic Party; Park Sang-woong of the New
Democratic Republican Party; Ko Young-koo, a lawyer running with
support from dissident groups; and Kim Hyung-joo, an independent
candidate.

   A one-day strike by cabin crews forced British
Airways to cancel three-fourths of its flights today, the airline
said.
   Members of the Transport and General Workers' Union voted earlier
this month to strike in support of a cabin attendant who was fired
for allegedly selling complimentary drinks and pocketing the cash.
   Available staff were being used on international flights, and all
of British Airways domestic shuttle services were canceled.
   The airline reduced the crews assigned to flights to the minimum
required by the Civil Aviation Authority and either reduced or
eliminated catering services.
   The transport union's membership strength is concentrated among
short-haul crews based at Heathrow Airport. Most of the long-haul
staff has joined a breakaway union, Cabin Crew '89.

<HEAD>Foreign Secretary Expresses Regret Over Killing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The foreign secretary expressed regret
over the death of an Australian missionary slain in a hostage drama
and lawmakers today called for an investigation to determine if she
was shot by troops.
   Jacqueline Hamill, 36, of Sydney was among five hostages and 16
convicts who died Tuesday before troops recaptured the jail at Davao
City, 610 miles south of Manila. Convicts had seized the hostages
during religious services Sunday.
   Miss Hamill arrived in the Philippines last month.
   ``We regret she had to lose her life that way,'' Foreign
Secretary Raul Manglapus told reporters. ``She was pursuing a
vocation which required her to expose her life in extraordinary
ways. Under those circumstances, of course, sometimes it is not
possible to give full protection. We regret that happened.''
   In Sydney, officials said Philippine President Corazon Aquino had
written Prime Minister Bob Hawke to express ``heartfelt sorrow''
over Miss Hamill's murder, saying security forces were left with no
choice after the prison inmates started killing the captives.
   Mrs. Aquino also expressed condolences to Ms. Hamill's family,
the officials said.
   Miss Hamill bled to death after being shot in the back, according
to Philippine officials.
   Doctors said she apparently had been shot from a distance because
there were no powder burns on the body. This led to speculation that
she may have been shot by military snipers who returned gunfire when
convicts tried to escape using their captives as shields.
   Rep. Ramon Mitra, speaker of the House of Representatives, and
Sen. Victor Ziga of the Senate Defense Committee said they wanted an
investigation to determine whether Miss Hamill was shot by soldiers.
   ``That's very crucial,'' Ziga said. ``I have not heard of any
occasion where rescuers shot at prisoners and endangered the lives
of the hostages.''
   The Australian Embassy in Manila has also asked for clarification
of the circumstances of her death.
   Military Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa has promised the
armed forces will cooperate.

<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of Russian workers in Estonia
called off their crippling nine-day walkout today and labor leaders
began intensive talks with the Baltic republic's government, strike
organizers said.
   ``While the negotiations go on, the cannons are silent,'' strike
committee member Marat Chekatovsky said in a telephone interview
from the Estonian capital of Tallinn.
   Employees at about 50 factories and at the republic's ports and
railroads agreed to return to work after strike leaders and Estonian
officials set an agenda for negotiations Thursday, Chekatovksy said.
   State-run Moscow Radio reported early today that the talks were
meant to ``ease the highly charged political and economic situation
in Estonia and calm down ethnic passions.''
   The Russian workers walked out to protest a law passed Aug. 8 by
the Estonian parliament that set the Soviet Union's first residency
requirements for voters and candidates. Russians and other
non-ethnic Estonians, who make up about 40 percent of the republic's
population of 1.6 million, complained that about 80,000 of them
would be disenfranchised.
   The national Presidium on Wednesday declared the law
unconstitutional in a decision approved by President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   Chekatovksy said that although the strike might be renewed, it
had accomplished many of its organizers' goals.
   ``Moscow and the whole Soviet Union and the world started to pay
attention to us,'' he said.
   Strike leaders on Thursday said they planned to continue the
strike until Estonian leaders agreed to accept the Presidium's
decision and change the law, but Chekatovsky said strike committee
and factory representatives voted late Thursday to return to work.
   The strike ``was starting to work against us,'' he said,
referring to the growing economic difficulties it caused in the tiny
Baltic republic.
   Izvestia, the government daily, on Thursday quoted Railway
Minister Nikolai Konarev as saying the walkout had idled 3,000
railcars in Estonia, of which more than 700 were left on railway
lines, blocking dozens of trains from proceeding.
   In Tallinn alone, where all stations that load and unload freight
were paralyzed by the walkout, 34 trains carrying perishable
foodstuffs and other goods waited to be discharged Thursday, Konarev
said.
   In another area threatened by nationalist labor unrest, Russian
workers in Moldavia staged a two-hour warning strike Wednesday. They
were protesting a proposed law that would make Moldavian the
republic's official language.

<TEXT>
   It's off to the auction block for a
20-foot, 250-pound python known to gobble down raccoons ``like they
were marshmallows'' within the glow of the glitzy Fort Lauderdale
beach strip.
   A veteran animal trapper who helped wrestle the snake from under
a home Thursday said he hopes to get at least $500 from a zoo or
nature preserve.
   The snake, which slithered about the residental seaside
neighborhood for years, was stuffed into a sleeping bag after it was
displayed to curious onlookers and news cameras.
   ``He won't have to eat for about a week,'' said Todd Hardwick,
owner of Pesky Critters Relocation in suburban Miami. ``When it is
time, I might feed him a rabbit.''
   ``We saw the head at first and everyone said, `Wow!''' said Bob
Moxley, a park ranger at Hugh Taylor Birch State Recreation Area,
where the snake searched for its prey. ``When it all came out,
everybody just screamed.''
   Hardwick believes the python was a pet released years ago in the
park and probably rested under the house when not hunting for food.
   ``The homeowners had been calling people for a month, but no one
wanted to go after it,'' said Hardwick, whose company traps nuisance
animals in south Florida. ``People say they've seen it eat 30-pound
raccoons like they were marshmallows.''
   The reticulate python, a native of Southeast Asia and Indonesia,
can grow to more than 30 feet. Though not venomous, the snake coils
around prey to stop breathing and blood flow.
   On Wednesday, Hardwick and a three-man crew began digging tunnels
below the home. They found the snake about eight feet underground
next to a concrete wall.
   ``I got close enough to snare it and then we just attacked,'' he
said. ``It showed no fear of us. It's a proud reptile. He could have
broken our ribs in the flash of an eye.''
   Homeowner David Spalding said he was unafraid of the reptile, but
he was concerned for others. ``The thing that frightened us was that
he could come out and attack a small child,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Advocates for the homeless say they're waiting for
HUD Secretary Jack Kemp to back up his rhetoric with cash for
housing programs.
   As Kemp spoke Thursday to a gathering of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference, his audience gave several standing ovations
but held to a wait-and-see attitude.
   ``We don't think it's reasonable or moral to have property
boarded up while people sleep in the streets and in shelters,'' said
SCLC President Joseph Lowery. ``While we are waiting, we've got to
utilize whatever funds are available to the best advantage. That's
why we are anxious to work with HUD.''
   Kemp delivered a brief address that reiterated his position of
improving housing for the poor and adopting a get-tough stance with
the scandal-ridden Department of Housing and Urban Development.
   But Washington homeless advocate Mitch Snyder responded to Kemp's
speech with an attack on the Bush administration for swiftly bailing
out savings and loan associations while ignoring funding needs for
housing.
   ``I didn't hear a ... word from Mr. Kemp about money. And I've
been waiting for him and his boss to start talking about money,''
Snyder said.
   Snyder said the housing budget proposed by the Bush
administration ``contained less money for housing than the last
budget that was introduced by Mr. Reagan.''
   Bush's 1990 budget allows $15.1 billion for housing, compared to
the $12.9 billion in the 1989 budget, drafted under Reagan. The 1988
budget, also under Reagan, allowed $18.6 billion for housing.
   Kemp spoke at the SCLC's 32nd annual convention about cleaning up
his department.
   ``I want to clean it out. I want to make sure it works for the
needy, not the greedy,'' Kemp said. ``We're going to make it work
for the poor again. I pledge that to you.''
   He left soon after the speech for Washington.
   Comedian-activist Dick Gregory, a panelist, expressed displeasure
with Kemp's speedy departure.
   ``We need to bring Kemp not to speak, but to listen,'' Gregory
said.
   The SCLC has placed homelessness atop its national agenda. In
April, with the help of Snyder and several local homeless advocacy
groups, it seized a boarded-up, foreclosed Atlanta house and cleaned
it up for use by the homeless.
   The SCLC then arranged for a Florida S&amp;L to sell the house to a
homeless couple for $10,000.

<TEXT>
   Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani
promised help to free Western hostages in Lebanon provided the
United States improves relations with his country, and he cited
frozen Iranian assets as one sore point.
   ``I have said many times that if the United States expects us to
help in the Lebanese issue, it should show in practice that it has
dropped its hostile stand against us,'' he told Pakistan's foreign
minister after being sworn into office Thursday before Iran's
Parliament.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted Foreign Minister
Yaqoub Khan of Pakistan as saying he had been asked to seek Iran's
cooperation in freeing the 16 hostages, who include eight Americans.
Most are held by pro-Iranian groups.
   Rafsanjani indicated it could be some time before there could be
any accommodation on the hostage issue, according to IRNA, monitored
in Nicosia.
   ``If the Americans really do have good will, it must take a very
long time before this good will can be proven in practice,'' he said.
   Rafsanjani said Washington had shown hostility toward Iran by
freezing billions of dollars in Iranian assets and by supporting
Iraq in its eight-year war with Iran.
   On Sunday IRNA said Iran would ``use its maximum influence for
the release of all the hostages'' if the United States freed $2
billion in Iranian assets. The assets were frozen 10 years ago after
Iranians seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans
hostage for 444 days.
   But in what appears to be a continuing power struggle between
hard-liners and pragmatists, Iran's spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei said Monday that there would be no dealings with the
``cursed'' United States.
   At the swearing-in Thursday, Rafsanjani pledged to use the
increased powers of the presidency to avoid political strife, but he
acknowledged that political infighting has undermined efforts to
form a Cabinet.
   Rafsanjani, a middle-ranking clergyman, took over from Khamenei,
who was elected the Islamic republic's supreme spiritual leader
after the death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini on June 3.
   The new president leads the so-called pragmatists in Iran, who
favor improving relations with the West to gain technology and
financing for rebuilding an economy devastated by the Iran-Iraq war.
   The rival radicals, headed by Interior Minister Ali Akbar
Mohtashemi, advocate strict controls on economic and social activity

<TEXT>
   A man has sued a prestigious prep school,
saying his son's education extended to drugs and alcohol with the
school's knowledge.
   Dr. Manuel C. Palao alleges in a lawsuit filed in federal court
in Trenton that his 13-year-old son Michael became addicted to drugs
and alcohol at Lawrenceville School.
   Palao charges that officials knew of and condoned drug and
alcohol use by youths at the boarding school that was established in
1810 and has turned out such alumni as publisher Malcolm Forbes Sr.
and rock 'n' roll star Huey Lewis.
   At the end of each semester, housemasters responsible for the
youth's dormitory would pass out containers to collect contraband
``as a form of general amnesty,'' the lawsuit charges.
   ``The contraband collected would generally fill a large plastic
trash bag,'' the lawsuit alleges.
   Officials at the Lawrenceville School said they had not seen the
lawsuit and were not prepared to comment on it, according to Dorothy
Silvestri, secretary to Associate Headmaster Anthony Wilson.
   Palao of Bethlehem, Pa., enrolled his son in September 1985 at
the school, which is about 10 miles north of Trenton. He removed
Michael from the school in 1988 after learning he had become
addicted to drugs and alcohol, his lawyer, Michael J. Perrucci, said
Thursday.
   Perrucci said the boy began using marijuana and alcohol during
his first year. Since leaving the school he has undergone drug
rehabilitation at a cost of $32,304, the lawyer said.
   The lawsuit names the school and four top educators.
   Perrucci said his client wants to be reimbursed for the drug
counseling and $33,739 in tuition paid over three years.
   The lawsuit also seeks personal damages for the boy's mental
anguish, loss of reputation and damages for two lost years of income
as a result of the interruption of his schooling, the lawyer said.

   A Woodstock reunion concert drew just a
handful of people, and promoters offered cut-rate tickets to
thousands who came to the site of the original concert on the
event's 20th anniversary.
   State police estimated 10,000 people Thursday night were at the
farm, once owned by Max Yasgur, where more than 400,000 young people
gathered Aug. 15-17, 1969, for Woodstock.
   At the Imperial Hotel in Swan Lake, about 10 miles away, the
audience of 250 attending the opening of a three-day ``Remember
Woodstock'' concert was almost outnumbered by security guards,
vendors and reporters. Promoters had hoped for a crowd of 4,000.
   Thursday afternoon, ``Remember Woodstock'' promoters sent buses
over to the Bethel site, hoping to entice customers with cheap
tickets and a free ride to the hotel and back. There were few takers
for the $5 tickets, which originally had been priced at $30,
promoters said.
   Some people who attended the Imperial concert left the hotel to
go to the original site, where free music was offered on a makeshift
stage.
   Richard Pell, the unofficial master of ceremonies in Bethel, said
Imperial Vice President Bruce Taylor was booed from the stage when
he tried to entice people to go to the hotel.
   ``They had six buses up here,'' Pell said. ``They asked $5 a
ticket and they bus you up there. Four people left. The music is
here.''
   Concert promoter Elliott Schneider blamed the small turnout in
part to rumors that major rock groups were going to appear at the
Bethel site.
   Schneider said the concert could break even if about 6,000 people
attend the three-day event. He said he expects attendance to
increase considerably Friday and Saturday.
   ``All my business sense told me not to try it,'' said Imperial
owner Michael Chung. ``But I tell you now, we're going to make this
thing an annual event.''
   The Imperial concert started about 5 p.m. when Woodstock's
original master of ceremonies, Wavy Gravy, shirtless and wearing
tie-dyed shorts and a propeller beanie, came on stage.
   ``I challenge William Bennett to a debate,'' he said, responding
to federal drug czar Bennett's lament earlier this week that the
press was glorifying the memory of a 1969 concert well-known for
rampant drug use.
   Gravy introduced Thursday's performers, who included Woodstock
veteran John Sebastian and David Massengil, Futu Futu, Willie
Nininger and Family, the Woodstock All Star Band, Leon Russell and
Edgar Winter.

<TEXT>
   A wildfire that charred more than 15,000 acres
in San Diego and Riverside counties was started by an arsonist, not
a target shooter's stray bullet as initially reported, the U.S.
Forest Service said.
   The blaze, which started July 29 near Vail Lake in southern
Riverside County, burned out of control for 10 days and came
dangerously close to the Mount Palomar Observatory before 2,800
firefighters encircled it.
   Tommy LaNier, special agent in charge of the Cleveland National
Forest, said Thursday that investigators recovered the remnants of
an incendiary device ``at the point of origin.''
   He only would not be specific about the device, and only said it
started the fire.
   LaNier said forestry officials knew arson was the cause five days
after the fire started. But officials continued to cite the
target-shooting theory because they didn't want to risk compromising
their probe, La Nier said.
   Authorities have questioned several people. No arrests have been
made.
   The cost of battling the blaze, which at one point threatened a
2,000-acre reserve for spotted owls and bald eagles, has been
estimated at $8 million.
   The fire destroyed a watershed in the Cleveland National Forest.
In Riverside County, it destroyed a three-bedroom home, a mobile
home, a trailer and several sheds.
   The blaze was contained on Aug. 7, but about 200 firefighters
remain on the scene mopping up.

   Thunderstorms flooded towns in Utah and Arizona today, while
showers fell across much of the southern and central United States.
   Heavy rain warnings were issued from Tennessee and Kentucky
across the central Atlantic Coast and from Colorado across New
Mexico and western Texas, in Utah and central Arizona.
   Thundershowers rolled over much of Utah beginning late Thursday,
bringing hail and winds up to 67 mph.
   ``My peach tree spiraled up in the air about 30 feet and then
came down in the backyard. I've never seen anything like it
before,'' South Salt Lake resident Dorothy Russett said.
   Orangeville, Utah, reported 1.14 inches of rain in an hour, and
two canals overflowed. Flooding also was reported in Castle Dale and
Price.
   The storm caused power lines over much of Salt Lake City to arc
about 6:30 p.m. Thursday and ``transformers were sparking
everywhere,'' a fire dispatcher said. Authorities reported many
scattered outages and said a few dozen customers were without power
early today.
   Heavy rain caused flooding at Tucson, Ariz., and winds gusted to
52 mph near Phoenix, while small hail fell at Lichtfield Park.
   Hail clattered over portions of central Kentucky, with floods in
Paris and roaring winds that uprooted trees and damaged buildings in
Scott.
   A waterspout formed over Biscayne Bay, Fla., Thursday night, then
moved across the Venetian Causeway and damaged a house.
   Heavier rainfall during the 6 hours ending at 2 a.m. EDT included
3 inches at Virginia Beach. Va., 1} inches at Jackson, Ky., and
nearly an inch at Prescott, Ariz.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from the
Virginias across Georgia, Alabama, southern Mississippi and parts of
Gulf Coast, over southern Florida and the northern Plains, and from
eastern Montana across New Mexico and northern Arizona. Sunny
weather was expected over the rest of the nation.
   Highs were predicted in the 90s over North Dakota, Utah,
southwest Oregon and central California, southern Arizona, Texas,
the lower Mississippi Valley and Florida; near 110 degrees in the
desert Southwest; and in the 70s and 80s over much of the nation.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 43
degrees at Alpena, Mich., to 90 degrees at Blythe, Calif.

<TEXT>
   Rep. Larkin Smith's widow characterized her
husband as a good family man as well as a loyal public servant.
   ``Larkin loved his family,'' Sheila Smith said Thursday during
the funeral Mass for the freshman Mississippi congressman. ``He
always held my hand and held me close to him. He always made me feel
special.''
   Standing with their daughter, Tracy, and 6-month-old grandson,
Bryce Anthony, Mrs. Smith said she and her husband ``always joked
about death'' and ``he wanted his epitaph to read, `Mission aborted,
gone home.'''
   The 45-year-old Republican was killed Sunday night as he traveled
to his home in Gulfport from Hattiesburg, where he had thrown out
the first pitch in a youth baseball series. The bodies of Smith and
pilot Chuck Vierling were found Monday in the scattered wreckage of
a single-engine Cessna 177.
   Investigators with the National Transportation Safety Board have
said Vierling, 58, apparently strayed from his anticipated flight
path on the 70-mile trip before clipping a tree in the DeSoto
National Forest.
   NTSB officials said Thursday that they had ruled out mechanical
problems as a cause of the crash. The investigation now centers on
weather conditions and the pilot's actions, said Jeff Kennedy, a
NTSB investigator.
   About 20 congressmen arrived from Washington to attend the
funeral at the Mississippi Coast Convention Center in Biloxi. Most
of the state's top political leaders and several hundred law
enforcement officers from Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana also
were among about 3,000 mourners.
   Catholic Bishop Joseph Howze of the Biloxi Diocese, who delivered
the eulogy, said Smith ``lived a life of faith, hope and love in
following after the pattern set by Christ.''
   Howze said Smith, a member of a Pass Christian parish, ``shared
the challenge of creating a better world'' and demonstrated ``a
solid commitment to everything he encountered.''
   ``He was dedicated, he was honest, he was professional, he was
helpful,'' said Joe Price, chief deputy with the Harrison County
Sheriff's Department, which Smith headed before going to Washington,
D.C., in January.
   Smith spent 22 years in law enforcement, serving also as police
chief in Gulfport.

<TEXT>
   Here are sketches of the three candidates
proposed by Solidarity leader Lech Walesa on Thursday for the post
of prime minister:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   BRONISLAW GEREMEK _ In April, when Solidarity was legalized after
a seven-year ban, Geremek faced a tough decision: whether to return
after years of opposition activity to the academic world of medieval
studies or continue to serve Solidarity's march to democracy as a
top adviser.
   The 57-year-old professor, fluent in French and proficient in at
least two other languages, chose Solidarity.
   Geremek became a well-known figure in the opposition in the late
1970s when he lectured on officially taboo topics of Polish history
and culture in private apartments as part of the so-called ``Flying
University'' created in the late 1970s.
   He crossed paths with workers during the Gdansk strikes in August
1980.
   Soon after the strikes broke out, Geremek and Tadeusz Mazowiecki,
another Solidarity candidate for prime minister, rushed north with a
letter signed by intellectuals urging authorities to find a solution
without force.
   The strikers invited Geremek and Mazowiecki to stay at the strike
as their advisers.
   The historian's life has not been the same since.
   He was arrested Dec. 13, 1981, when martial-law was declared. He
was released a year later and then fired in 1985 from his academic
job because of his continued role as a Solidarity adviser.
   Geremek was elected a deputy to parliament in the June elections
and then chosen to lead the Solidarity caucus.
   He is one of Walesa's chief representatives in meetings with top
foreign officials. Since the union was legalized in April, he has
traveled to West Germany and France for meetings with senior
officials and last week met Pope John Paul II in Rome.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   JACEK KURON _ The longtime rebel, now 55, is one of the fiercest
fighters for greater democracy in Poland.
   The Communist Party lost the young recruit by expelling him from
the party eight months after he joined in March 1953 for refusing to
submit to a required session of self-criticism.
   A historian and teacher, Kuron's 1964 ``Open Letter to Party''
criticized the Communist system for abusing workers. For it, he
served three years in prison.
   Authorities accused him of instigating student demonstrations in
1968 and kept him in jail for another 3{ years.
   In 1976, he helped found the Committee for the Defense of Workers
to help workers fired from their jobs and forced to stand trial
after worker riots that year.
   A tireless pamphleteer, Kuron seemed born for politics. There was
hardly an important opposition declaration he didn't sign in the
1970s, and in 1980 he became an adviser to strikers in Gdansk.
   He, too, was rounded up on the December 1981 night that
martial-law was proclaimed.
   Released in an amnesty in 1984, Kuron immediately began holding
news conferences and issuing reports on the conditions of those
still in jail.
   Elected a deputy in the June elections, Kuron is on the presidium
of the Solidarity caucus in parliament.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   TADEUSZ MAZOWIECKI _ Mazowiecki, 62, is the least public
candidate for prime minister, a close confidant of Walesa with
strong ties to the Roman Catholic Church.
   Mazowiecki, trained as a lawyer, was one of the founders in 1957
of the Warsaw Club of Catholic Intelligentsia, known in Polish as
KIK, an influential forum that served as a bulwark for Catholic
opposition to communist ideology.
   He served in parliament as part of ZNAK, a group of Roman
Catholics who supported regeneration of Poland based on Catholic
values.
   Mazowiecki initiated a letter by more than 60 intellectuals
urging authorities to find a peaceful solution to the strikes that
broke out on the Baltic coast in August 1980 and led to the
formation of the independent Solidarity trade union.
   He was jailed during martial-law, and when released became
Walesa's assistant and remained a top adviser to Walesa during the
years that the union was banned.
   He did not run for parliament, preferring to edit Tygodnik
Solidarnosc, the Solidarity weekly revived after the union was
legalized in April.

   Police began a search today for four
men who made off with $1 million in cash during a robbery on a busy
highway.
   Police said the robbers, all in their 20s or 30s, Thursday
stopped in front of a car carrying two men transporting teachers'
salaries near Kongju, in the central part of the country.
   Kim Yong-man, 33, told police three of the robbers, one of whom
had a gun, forced him and his companion to get out of the car. The
three bandits then jumped in the car containing the cash and drove
off, followed by the fourth robber in another car, police said.
   They said many cars were traveling on the highway when the
robbery occurred about noon. One witness said she saw a man holding
a gun when she drove by, but thought it was an officer, police said.
   The stolen money was to be paid as salaries to teachers and
school staff in the Kongju district.
   Salaries in Korea are usually paid in cash.

<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino today
threatened to fire her justice secretary and other officials if they
fail to arrest corrupt government employees, tax evaders and other
``big fish'' criminals by the end of the year.
   In a statement addressed to Justice Secretary Sedfrey Ordonez,
Mrs. Aquino said her adminstration has failed to enforce laws
because of a double standard favoring the rich.
   ``Nothing impairs the credibility of government more than the
common perception that we have two standards of justice, one for the
poor, and another for the rich and powerful,'' she said in the
statement, released to news media.
   ``We have done nothing to disprove this perception. Until now we
have not secured the conviction of that elusive `big fish,''' she
added.
   ``I am now placing all of you under probation,'' she said. ``At
the end of the year, we will assess your performance as individuals
and a department. If I am not satisfied, I will not hesitate to
exercise my power to remove appointees.''
   Mrs. Aquino's former spokesman, Teodoro Benigno, says the
president knows who the biggest offenders in the government and
private sector are but has not moved against them because of a lack
of evidence.
   ``The president will need ... audacity in dealing with graft and
corruption,'' Benigno wrote recently in the newspaper The Philippine
Star. ``And she'll have to do away with that tired, old cliche that
she needs proof.''
   Mrs. Aquino ``knows who the big grafters are, who the big tax
evaders are, who the big smugglers are. And I can assure her the
entire nation will cheer if tomorrow she marches three of them to
pokey,'' Benigno said.

   An Argentine financier faces a maximum sentence
of 25 years in jail and fines and restitution totaling $114 million
after pleading guilty of defrauding his now-defunct bank.
   Jacobo Finkielstain, 51, of Buenos Aires entered his plea
Thursday before U.S. District Judge Michael Mukasey on charges he
participated in a scheme to defraud the Central Bank of New York, of
which he was 99 percent owner, of $38 million.
   He pleaded guilty as part of an agreement with prosecutors on
five counts of a 29-count indictment that was handed down in
January. His trial had been scheduled to begin Monday.
   He will be sentenced Oct. 20.
   The Central Bank of New York, a federally insured bank, was
closed and placed in receivership by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. in September 1987.
   Finkielstain has extensive real estate holdings in Argentina and
owns several companies, including the movie production house that
produced the film ``The Official Story,'' which won an Academy Award
in 1986 for best foreign film.
   He faces a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison, fines totaling
$76 million and an additional $38 million in restitution, U.S.
Attorney Benito Romano said in a statement.
   Finkielstain remains free on $30 million bail on condition he
stay in the United States.

<HEAD>Army Reservist Linked to Beating Death Kills Himself, Reports Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARJORIE OLSTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An army reserve member who feared he would be
blamed for the beating death of a Palestinian killed himself with a
burst of machine-gun fire, Israeli news reports said today.
   Yariv Bar-Yosef, 25, shot himself in the head with his Uzi
machine gun early Thursday, the reports said. An army spokeswoman
said she could not comment because the case involving Bar-Yosef was
still under investigation.
   Also today, a new security policy went into effect that requires
Palestinians entering Israel to carry computerized identity cards.
Palestinians said they would boycott their jobs in Israel to protest
the restriction.
   Traffic into Israel was light from both Gaza and the occupied
West Bank. But officials blamed this more on Friday being the Moslem
prayer day than on the call by uprising leaders for workers to
boycott jobs in Israel.
   Palestinian reporters said a true test of the boycott would
probably come Sunday, when workers from the West Bank and Gaza Strip
return to Israel after the Jewish Sabbath.
   Israeli officials say the card system is intended to prevent
those with criminal or security records from entering Israel
following a series of attacks on Jews by Arabs.
   Palestinians argue the system is a further attempt by Israel to
quell the revolt against occupation by putting an economic squeeze
on Gaza, where poverty is widespread and few jobs are available.
   At least 537 Palestinians have been killed in clashes with
soldiers or other Israelis in the 20-month-old Palestinian uprising
against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Ninety-five other Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs as
alleged collaborators with Israel, and 38 Israelis also have been
slain.
   Bar-Yosef was among soldiers being investigated by military
police in connection with the Aug. 22, 1988, beating death of Hani
El-Shami, 42, in the Gaza Strip. A military tribunal ruled that the
death resulted from blows El-Shami received at the army's Jabaliya
detention following an earlier beating that day by soldiers at his
home.
   Four soldiers of the elite Givati brigade, who are stationed at
the Gaza Strip's Jabiliya refugee camp, were acquitted of
manslaughter and convicted of brutality.
   Bar-Yosef, who was not among those convicted in the earlier
trial, served in a reserve unit as a guard in the detention center.
He testified that he kicked El-Shami in the shoulder on the day he
died, the daily Yediot Ahronot said today.
   The trial raised a controversy over Defense Minister Yitzhak
Rabin's declared policy of beating Palestinian demonstrators in an
effort to halt the uprising against Israeli occupation.
   Shortly after the trial, a military judge was appointed to reopen
the inquiry into El-Shami's death. Yediot said Bar-Yosef was
questioned several times since by military police.
   According to Yediot, Bar-Yosef said in the suicide note he feared
he would become the next scapegoat of the Givati affair. He referred
to Israel as ``a land that devours its people'' and expressed fears
he would be imprisoned.
   Bar-Yosef, a student at Jerusalem's Hebrew University, was found
dead outside government-owned Israel Television, where he worked
part-time as a security guard. He had been shot in the head with his
own Uzi.

   Cocaine corruption is sweeping across the
hemisphere, with one Bahamian official offering to sell traffickers
every ounce of the drug confiscated in that island nation, a Senate
witness says.
   ``In the Bahamas, it goes all the way to the top,'' convicted
drug smuggler Max Mermelstein said Thursday, testifying from behind
a screen while six government bodyguards stood by.
   The federally protected witness told the Senate Judiciary
Committee in an electronically disguised voice that before his 1985
arrest he smuggled up to 55 tons of cocaine into the United States
as an employee of ``the boys from Colombia.''
   He has been cooperating with the government and has a price on
his head that committee Chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del., placed at $3
million.
   Biden called the hearing to provide background before the
administration unveils its comprehensive drug-fighting program next
month.
   Mermelstein said the United States has been slowed in its moves
to combat Colombian traffickers in part ``because we deal directly
with the police and local governments and in South America that's a
direct line to the cartel.''
   High-ranking Army officers appear immune to cocaine corruption in
Colombia, he said, but other officials are either bribed or murdered.
   ``Either they take the money or they die,'' he said.
   He said the corruption was by no means confined to Colombia and
that he was once ``offered a deal of so much per kilo for any
cocaine confiscated by the Bahamian government for distribution in
the United States.''
   ``We were setting it up but I was arrested,'' he said.
   He said one cartel pilot, forced by plane trouble to set down in
Cuba with a load of cocaine, was told a $10,000 payoff would always
buy emergency landing privileges.
   Cocaine kingpins have used billions of ``narcodollars'' from U.S.
sales to follow a globe-hopping lifestyle, with visits to the
bullfights in Mexico and Spain as well as the Olympic games in
Korea, Mermelstein said.
   In other testimony, the commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen.
Alfred Gray, told the panel he is skeptical about so-called boot
camps advocated by some law enforcement officials for young drug
offenders instead of prison.
   ``I can tell you right up front if you don't provide an
alternative it will fail,'' he said, adding that Marine boot camp is
designed to produce fighting men and not to punish offenders.
   ``It's a completely different kind of socialization,'' he said.
   He said the ``center of gravity'' in fighting drugs in America is
on the side of stopping demand rather than supply and was critical
of the idea of a military attack on South American coca fields.
   ``I hope we can have a more balanced and far-reaching thought
process ... because we live in a more complex world than that, and I
think we all know that,'' he said.
   A former assistant U.S. attorney in Miami, Richard Gregorie, told
the committee the Customs Service and the Marshals Service developed
a plan to arrest Colombian drug kingpin Jorge Ochoa last fall during
a trip to Caracas, Venezuela, and fly him to the United States for
trial, but the plan was dropped because of State Department
opposition.
   Ochoa has been indicted by U.S. grand juries several times, but
the Colombian Supreme Court abrogated that country's extradition
treaty with the United States two years ago and he cannot be
arrested by his country's authorities on a U.S. warrant.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Leland Tragedy Could Help Open the Door in Ethiopia</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: To update, adds 2 grafs after 5th previous, ``The Soviets''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Ethiopia, a proud and historic country now
under Marxist rule, could be the prize as the Soviet Union gradually
loosens its ties to client states and the United States tries to
cope with famine and hunger in Africa.
   The death in an air crash last week of Rep. Mickey Leland, a
Texas Democrat who was a strong friend to Ethiopia and anyone
suffering from hunger, touched off a cooperative search that is
likely to lead to better relations _ provided two U.S. conditions
are met.
   Those conditions, as outlined by senior State Department
officials, are a continuing improvement in human rights and a
serious effort by Addis Ababa to reconcile with separationists in
Ethiopia's Eritrea region and an autonomous movement in Tigray.
   ``There exists a window of opportunity evolving from this
tragedy,'' said Rep. Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y., who served with Leland
on the House Select Committee on Hunger and was in the helicopter
that spotted the Leland plane's wreckage.
   ``The Soviets have said they are cutting Ethiopia off. Ethiopia
needs to be adopted and supported by somebody.''
   On Thursday, former President Carter announced Thursday that he
will serve as a neutral observer when Ethiopian officials and
leaders of a rebel group hold preliminary peace talks next month at
Carter's policy center in Atlanta, Ga.
   Carter said the talks between the government of Ethiopia and the
Eritrean People's Liberation Front will last for several days and
will lay the groundwork for further negotiations toward ending the
Ethiopian civil war.
   Congress prefers the United States not deal with Marxist-Leninist
governments. Laws restrict official business with Ethiopia, and the
1961 Foreign Assistance Act bars U.S. aid to many comunist
countries, with exceptions.
   Other laws prohibit U.S. support for international loans to
countries that systematically violate human rights and bar aid to
countries that have not paid their debts _ both of which apply to
Ethiopia.
   Ethiopia is eligible for humanitarian assistance, and during a
1988 famine the United States provided about $120 million _ the
largest outlay to any African country that year.
   Not one Ethiopian died in the drought, a U.S. official said
Thursday with evident pride.
   U.S. foreign policy is governed by complex considerations and not
just the political stripe of a country _ as evidenced by President
Bush's offer of economic development aid to Poland and Hungary in a
bid to encourage capitalism in those East European countries.
   The fact that there are about 2,000 political prisoners in
Ethiopia is considered a much larger obstacle to friendlier U.S.
relations than the governing Marxist philosophy in Addis Ababa.
   Ethiopia is the oldest independent country in Africa and one of
the oldest in the world. Its ties to Moscow began with the signing
of a military assistance agreement in 1976. The next year Ethiopia
scrapped its weapons pact with the United States, and Soviet arms
and Cuban troops helped Ethiopia expel Somali forces from the Ogaden
region in 1977 and 1978.
   The United States did not break off relations with Ethiopia,
which date back to 1903. But its embassies are not headed by
ambassadors _ a sign of U.S. distaste for the regime of President
Mengistu Haile Mariam.
   Nonetheless, Uncle Sam has been ready with a helping hand.
   ``Our major interest is the welfare of the people,'' said a
senior U.S. official of humanitarian assistance to Ethiopia or any
other Marxist country.
   There are strategic motivations, as well, for the gradual
improvement in relations.
   Ackerman stressed foreign policy considerations in an interview
Wednesday.
   The guerrillas in Eritrea and Tigray ``are beating (Mengistu) to
a pulp,'' Ackerman said. ``If Ethiopia gets severed you basically
have Arab control of the whole border of the Red Sea. It would be
giving the region away to the Arab world. Government by
fundamentalism is a tremendous threat.''
   Therefore, the congressman said, the Bush administration should
upgrade its relations with Mengistu.
   ``He is willing to make concessions, to act out of his need for
survival,'' Ackerman concluded.
   Some State Department officials offer a somewhat different
analysis. The Eritrean People's Liberation Front, which has been at
war with the central government for 27 years, is about 50 percent
Christian in background, and fundamentalism is not a driving force
in neighboring Somalia.
   Still, Ackerman and the State Department officials agree that it
would be good to improve relations.
   ``A friendly and coherent Ethiopia would have an effect on its
neighbors, too,'' said a senior U.S. official. ``Access to that part
of the world is important. It shouldn't be overstated. It is an area
that is important to be open and not to have doors closed to us.''

   The eight folks who showed up to claim a $24
million lottery prize last month aren't smiling any more, now that
one of them has sued six of the others claiming they aren't entitled
to any of the winnings.
   James Macieko, 42, of Bellmore contends in court papers filed
Thursday that he and his fiancee, Catherine Salenga, 38, of Dix
Hills, were the only true winners in the July 12 drawing, the
fifth-biottery history.
   He charged that he was intimidated and threatened with the loss
of the prize money to include the other six, all members oggest in state
lf the
Welsch family of New York, in the winning ticket. The Welsches deny
the charge.
   Macieko is the former owner of the Liberty Card Store, where the
winning ticket was purchased. He and Salenga sold the shop to
brothers William, Frank and Joseph Welsch a year ago.
   Macieko said he had played Lotto at the card shop twice a week
for the past 10 years using the same numbers _ 1, 4, 9, 16, 24, 32.
In court papers, Macieko contends he had an arrangement with William
Welsch to play those numbers twice a week on his behalf.
   During a July 17 news conference to announce jackpot winners,
Macieko and Salenga, the three Welsch brothers and three other
family members said they had been buying tickets as a group everreplied
that although Macieko picked the numbers, Welsch had
bought the ticket _ and that made Welsch the winner.
   ``I pleaded with him, `Don't do this to me,''' Macieko said in
court papers. Welsch then agreed to give Macieko and Salenga a cut
of the prize, he said.
   Macieko said that at first, he accepted a share of the prize,
because he feared that ``if I didn't accept the offer as proposed, I
would get nothing.'' But in his suit, he argues that he and his
fiancee should get the whole amount.
   The Welsches denied any wrongdoing, saying that the story told at
the news conference is the true one.
   ``Macieko is a greedy S.O.B.,'' said Frank Welsch. ``Those two
are trying to horn in and get a greater part of the share.''
   The first of 20 yearly prize checks was to be sent this week, but
the court ordered the distribution of the money postponed while the
case is pending.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament and state-run media
today criticized a resolution passed by the Polish parliament
condemning the 1968 Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia.
   The government said Thursday it will come down hard on any
protests Monday marking the 21st anniversary of the invasion that
crushed the brief reform period known as ``Prague Spring.''
   In its reaction to the Polish parliament's vote Thursday, the
presidium of the Czechoslovak parliament said it ``is taken aback by
these declarations which ... are a gross interference in internal
affairs of Czechoslovakia and categorically rejects them.''
   The resolution adopted by the Polish Sejm, the lower house of the
National Assembly, said the Soviet-led invasion ``violated every
nation's inalienable right to self-determination and its natural
desire for democracy, freedom and respect of human rights.''
   On Tuesday, Hungary's Communist Party said its ``present
leadership ... does not concur with the 1968 military intervention
in Czechoslovakia'' but that assessing the event ``should be the
right and task of the Czechoslovak people and the Czechoslovak
Communist Party.''
   The 1968 invasion crushed a short-lived liberalization period
spearheaded by then Communist Party leader Alexander Dubcek, who was
ousted in April 1969.
   Communist East Germany, meanwhile, strongly defended the invasion.
   New Germany, the East German Communist Party daily newspaper,
claimed that the United States and West Germany led ``imperialist
forces'' trying to influence Czechoslovak affairs in the days before
the Warsaw Pact invasion.
   The newspaper commentary reiterated the hard line East Germany
has adhered to while allied Hungary, Poland and the Soviet Union
have introduced economic and social reforms and begun a reassessment
of their pasts.
   East Germany has resisted the reforms advocated by Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and it has given little attention in the
state-run media to the democratic advances sweeping Poland and
Hungary.

<TEXT>
   A 26-year-old man who confessed to the brutal
slayings of three young girls that terrorized a suburban Tokyo
neighborhood said he also kidnapped and killed a fourth girl, a
newspaper said today.
   The deaths of the four girls have deeply shocked Japan, and Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu and other government officials today urged
police to fully investigate the string of murders.
   Tsutomu Miyazaki, a printing shop assistant, recently admitted
under police questioning that he killed Masami Yoshizawa, the Japan
Broadcasting Corp. and Asahi Shimbun newspaper quoted police as
saying.
   Miyazaki confessed he had kidnapped and killed Masami, age 7, and
``buried her in the mountains,'' Asahi Shimbun said. Masami has been
missing since October, when she left her home in Saitama prefecture,
north of Tokyo, to play.
   A Tokyo Metropolitan Police official declined to comment on the
reports.
   Miyazaki is under arrest for kidnapping and killing 5-year-old
Ayako Nomoto. On Sunday, two days after his arrest, he also
confessed that he had kidnapped and killed two other girls, Mari
Konno and Erika Namba, both age 4, police officials said.
   In a country with remarkably little crime, the killings and
Miyazaki's confessions have received extensive media coverage.
Television stations have shown pictures of the inside of his home,
filled from floor to ceiling with comic books and about 4,500
videos, including many animated films.
   Viewers also have heard his former co-workers, teachers and
school mates, neighbors, parents of victims and handwriting analysts
comment on the cruelty of the murders.
   But some people have criticized the reporting for going too far.
In its current issue, the liberal weekly magazine Asahi Journal said
that competition among the media had been excessive.
   Miyazaki was handed over to prosecutors Sunday. Under Japanese
law, prosecutors have a maximum of 20 days to collect evidence
against him before releasing him or bringing formal charges.

<TEXT>
   China has scrapped plans to mark its 40th National
Day with a military parade, according to official reports, in an
apparent move to avoid reminding people of the crackdown on the
pro-democracy movement.
   In another development, Chinese sources said President Yang
Shangkun, a central figure in the June crackdown, had ordered the
defense minister and several commanders detained to strengthen his
control of the military.
   National Day marks the establishment of communist rule in China.
This year's celebrations, scheduled for Oct. 1, were to have been
the most elaborate in five years.
   Military reviews, held annually from 1949 to 1959, were suspended
for 25 years. When they were revived in 1984, the reviews were to
have been part of National Day celebrations every five years.
   But Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong said Thursday no parade was planned
this year. He gave no reason, but his decision came two months after
the government dispatched troops and tanks to crush the seven-week
democracy movement.
   Beijing has been under martial law since May 20, and troops armed
with assault rifles have guarded the city since the crackdown began
June 3-4.
   The government says 200 people were killed when soldiers marched
on Beijing. Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence reports say
up to 3,000 people died.
   Chen said National Day flower displays will be set up again this
year in Tiananmen Square, the site of the student-led pro-democracy
demonstrations, but that only organized groups would be allowed in.
   Fireworks, parties, sports events and theatrical performances are
planned at parks, gymnasiums and theaters throughout the city, he
said.
   In 1984, Beijing celebrated National Day with a day of
festivities in the square, including a 1,200-piece military band, 18
formations of foot soldiers and 24 formations of military equipment
including anti-tank missiles, rocket mine-laying vehicles and
artillery. A civilian parade included 140,000 people.
   In the military power struggle, soldiers loyal to Yang went to
the Beijing residence of Defense Minister Qin Jiwei on Wednesday and
took him and one of his armed guards away, said the Chinese sources,
who demanded anonymity.
   The sources contacted The Associated Press separately. One is a
military officer who telephoned Hong Kong Thursday morning from
Beijing, and the other is a businessman, based in Hong Kong, who
says he has extensive contacts within the Chinese military.
   A Defense Ministry official said today he knew nothing about the
reports. Other offices in the Defense Ministry did not answer their
telephones today.
   Qin and Yang have been competing to become first vice chairman of
the Central Military Commission, China's top military body. The post
was left vacant by the dismissal of Zhao Ziyang on June 24 after he
expressed sympathy for the pro-democracy demonstrators.
   Other troops detained the heads of the Beijing, Guangzhou and
Nanjing military districts, who supported Qin, the sources said.

<HEAD>Press Publishes Trotsky Letters Criticizing Communist Party</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet press has published letters Leon Trotsky
wrote more than 60 years ago criticizing the Communist Party, the
latest step toward improving the image of the late party leader.
   In its August edition, the monthly youth journal Molodoi
Kommunist published several letters Trotsky wrote in the 1920s
complaining about the party bureaucracy.
   ``There is a tendency toward a greater and greater contradiction
between a few thousand people in command and the rest of the party
members,'' Trotsky wrote in a 1923 letter that appeared in Pravda
that year.
   The criticism is particularly relevant now as the party tries to
halt a loss of prestige and faith among the citizenry. President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev has called for a ``renewal'' of the 20
million-member party.
   As Trotsky did a half-century ago, many Soviets now blame the
party bureaucracy for impeding reform.
   Because of that criticism and other differences, dictator Josef
Stalin ordered Trotsky ousted from the party in 1927 and exiled him
two years later. Stalin had his foe killed in Mexico in 1940.
   Trotsky was close to Soviet founder Vladimir I. Lenin and helped
direct the 1917 coup that brought the Bolsheviks to power. He was
branded an enemy when Stalin took over.
   In November 1987, Gorbachev became the first Soviet leader in
decades to mention Trotsky publicly but condemned his call for world
revolution. Since then, Pravda has published an article
acknowledging the key role Trotsky played in the Russian Revolution
and Civil War.
   Officials have so far taken the stance that Trotsky's views were
wrong and his full rehabilitation soon is unlikely.
   In the letters reprinted in Molodoi Kommunist, Trotsky said
democracy was impossible to achieve in the Soviet Union but ``at the
same time, absolute centralism is incompatible with the nature of
the mass party.''

   President Bush took an ocean spin in
his speed boat today as he interspersed relaxation with updates on
political developments in Poland.
   Under bright, sunny skies, the president went by car to nearby
Biddeford where the power boat, Fidelity, was tied up in a yacht
harbor. Accompanied by local fishing buddy Bob Boilard, sons George
and Neil and the wife of his other son, Marvin, the president sped
out to sea, trailed by Secret Service agents in other boats.
   He cheerily waved off reporters' attempts to engage him in
conversation. ``Photo op,'' he said, referring to his rule about not
answering questions at occasions where he wants to be photographed
only.
   Bush on Thursday vowed to play golf every day until returning to
Washington on Sept. 4.
   Officials said the president was monitoring the moves that could
lead to a non-communist government in Poland but wasn't directly
involved in phone conversations with Polish or other East bloc
leaders.
   On the first full day of his three-week vacation, Bush passed up
an opportunity to respond directly to news that Polish President
Wojciech Jaruzelski had approved Solidarity leader Lech Walesa's
plan for a coalition government.
   However, administration officials privately were enthusiastic.
   Bush was on the golf course when reporters asked his reaction to
the developments in Poland.
   ``No comment,'' he replied.
   But the president was in a jovial mood as he raced around the 18
holes of a local course with his son, George W. Bush of Texas, and
club pro Ken Raynor.
   When reporters ran into a blank wall on the Poland issue, they
asked how his vacation was going.
   ``Now we're talking,'' the president replied.
   Vowing that he would play golf every day before he returns to
Washington, Bush joked to the accompanying pool of reporters, ``You
guys mind coming with us?''
   Bush was surrounded at Kennebunkport by numerous offspring and
grandchildren as well as his wife, Barbara, at the family home on
Walker's Point.
   He went boating on the ocean and played tennis under
picture-perfect bright sunny skies.
   Bush and his advisers were said to be pleased at the apparent
trend in Poland, but were choosing their words cautiously.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the
administration didn't want to ``upset the apple cart.''
   Bush was briefed on the Polish developments by Deputy National
Security Adviser Robert Gates, who accompanied him to Kennebunkport.
   ``Two years ago, no one in the United States would have predicted
this could happen,'' said a senior administration official who spoke
on condition of anonymity. ``Of course we're happy, extremely
happy.''
   Fitzwater said Bush, who voiced strong support for recent
political reforms during his trip to Poland last month, was not
endorsing Walesa or any other candidate.
   ``It is a sensitive situation there in terms of the general
movement away from the communist control,'' Fitzwater said.
   Bush and Walesa discussed the possibility of Walesa becoming
prime minister when the two had lunch in Gdansk last month,
Fitzwater said.
   Walesa has voiced reservations this week about accepting the post.
   Bush and Walesa ``talked about the political process and the
prospects and about Lech Walesa's personal feelings about his
role,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``The president understands the various pressures that are on Mr.
Walesa and he (Walesa) is very concerned about the new government,
about Solidarity's ability to step in and take over the new
government.''

   Poles are excited by stunning changes that
could lead to a non-communist government nearly eight years after a
martial law crackdown, and they hope the transition will revive the
nation's collapsing economy.
   Even in June, when the freest Polish elections in 40 years were
held, it would have been hard to believe the independent Solidarity
movement would do so well that it would force the first
non-communist government in the East bloc.
   A 20-year-old Catholic university student said she was surprised
at the historic changes that took place during her vacation the last
two weeks.
   ``I didn't expect all this when going for a holiday,'' she said
Thursday.
   ``The elections were only two months ago. ... But the abundance
of events is so great, out of proportion to the calendar,'' added a
middle-age man who was out with his dog.
   The young woman's homecoming and the man's evening walk were the
routine events of a day during which the seemingly inconceivable had
occurred.
   President Wojciech Jaruzelski, a Communist, was reported Thursday
to have agreed to nominate a prime minister from Solidarity, the
trade union he sought to crush with martial law in 1981. A
government official today said Jaruzelski's choice was Tadeusz
Mazowiecki, a journalist and longtime Solidarity activist.
   The continuing influence of the opposition union had shown the
world that the course of communism could be challenged, albeit as
much from the pressure of a national economic crisis as from
arguments about democracy.
   For the first time in the East bloc, the communists appear to be
on the verge of turning over the power to form a government.
   ``Now those who were under the wagon are on it,'' Solidarity
leader Lech Walesa told the West German ZDF television network after
his historic meeting with Jaruzelski Thursday.
   But in Warsaw's streets during the sultry summer evening,
surprise was tempered by a nearly exhausted faith in government.
   ``The point is not who it is going to be, as long as it is a
person who pulls us out from the pit,'' said a middle-age bookstore
worker waiting for the tram home.
   ``We want people who would care for the good of the country. We
don't care whether it is Solidarity, the Communist Party or some
other. The point is to get us out of this pit,'' said a retired
teacher a half-mile away at the central train station.
   His daughter-in-law spoke for others absorbed in dealing with
daily difficulties posed by inflation and shortages.
   ``One leads such a monotonous way of life _ home, work, family,
children, lines _ that one does not have time to be interested in
politics,'' she said.
   But she added, ``I think this is a great prospect of something
new.''

<HEAD>Lab Smashes Jet Into Concrete to Predict What Crash Would Do to Nuclear
Plant</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Scientists smashed an F-4 Phantom jet
into a concrete barrier to try to estimate what would happen if a
plane crashed into a nuclear reactor.
   Researchers at the Sandia National Laboratories said they hope
the information gathered from the 1988 test could help prevent a
nuclear disaster.
   ``The crash data are going to give us an unprecedented ability to
predict the impact force when an aircraft crashes into a building,''
said Walter A. von Riesemann, supervisor of Sandia's containment
technology division. ``We'd previously done some fairly accurate
computer analysis, but the computer models were untried on the real
thing. Not anymore.''
   The test was conducted at the lab's rocket sled facility just
south of Albuquerque in April 1988. The rocket-propelled F-4 smashed
head-on into a 1 million-pound concrete barrier. It shattered when
it hit the 23-foot-square, 12-foot-thick reinforced concrete block
at 480 mph.
   Details of the test were reported Thursday during the 10th
International Conference on Structural Mechanics in Reactor
Technology at Anaheim, Calif., Sandia officials said.
   Researchers need to estimate in detail the structural response of
a building if an airplane crashed or was rammed into it. To do that
they must know how the impact force changes throughout the brief
time the crash is in progress, Sandia officials said.
   In the past, engineers estimated the force of aircraft impacts by
analyzing the durability and mass of aircraft, then calculating how
much force a plane might exert on a building.
   The F-4 test showed that computer calculations were fairly
accurate, although they tended to overestimate the force of impact,
von Riesemann said.
   The plane, filled with more than 1,200 gallons of water to
simulate the weight of fuel, was shot along rails by a two-stage
rocket. It was held in a special carriage to prevent it from taking
off as it hurtled forward into the barrier.
   The crash was recorded by 16 high-speed cameras that shot from
500 to 2,000 frames per second, and by meters that measured the
impact.
   The test was paid for by the Muto Institute of Structural
Mechanics Inc. of Tokyo and was performed at Sandia under a joint
United States-Japanese agreement for cooperation on nuclear safety
engineering and research.
   The test was not announced until Thursday at the request of the
Japanese sponsors, lab officials said.

<HEAD>Former Czech Official Says Polish Developments Pose Potential Danger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leader of the 1968 Czechoslovak
reformist movement said today that Poland's political situation is
changing so quickly it could get out of control and threaten East
bloc reforms.
   Zdenek Mlynar made his comments on Austrian state radio after
reports that Poland's president, Wojciech Jaruzelski, had agreed to
name a representative of the Solidarity trade union to lead the East
bloc's first non-communist government.
   Mlynar lauded the recent decisions in Poland as opening ``a new
stage in the reform development'' in the Soviet bloc but said they
hold ``a (potentially) dangerous development.
   ``Here you come close to the limit of what ... Moscow's reform
politics can still tolerate,'' he said.
   In 1968, Mlynar was a Communist Party Central Committee secretary
in Prague and a close associate of the party chief, Alexander
Dubcek. Dubcek, who supported the Prague Spring reform movement, was
ousted after a Soviet-led invasion crushed the movement.
   Mlynar is now an Austrian citizen and works as a political
scientist. He frequently has acted as a political analyst of
developments in Eastern Europe.
   He said the situation in Poland might get out of control and grow
into a ``foreign policy problem, not only for Moscow but also for
the West, for European politics as a whole.''
   ``This is why one has to make sure that the (Polish) development
does not threaten the basic direction of the new Soviet foreign
policy,'' Mlynar said.
   ``What might get out of control is, above all, the ...
dissatisfaction of the masses,'' Mlynar said in the interview.
   He suggested that failure to improve the economy in Poland might
result in problems the Solidarity government would be unable to
control.

<TEXT>
   The only passenger vessel that serves the
Christian heartland came under Syrian fire at the port of Jounieh
north of Beirut today and fled back to its home port in Cyprus,
police said.
   Police said three people were killed and 21 wounded in artillery
duels between army commander Gen. Michel Aoun's 20,000 predominantly
Christian troops and the more than 40,000 Syrian and allied forces.
   The incidents came during a fragile lull in fighting following a
Tuesday appeal for a cease-fire by the U.N. Security Council.
   In Baghdad, the Iraqi capital, President Saddam Hussein, King
Hussein of Jordan and Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman
Yasser Arafat planned to meet to discuss renewing Arab efforts to
bring peace to Lebanon.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be identified in line with
standing regulations, said Syrian gunners fired about 120 rockets
from multibarreled launchers at the hydrofoil Santa Maria in
Jounieh, 12{ miles north of Beirut.
   Police said seven passengers waiting to board the ship were
wounded during the shelling.
   In the Cypriot port of Larnaca, a spokesman for the ship's agents
said the vessel's crew was unable to unload the baggage of the 120
passengers who went to Lebanon.
   ``The heavy shelling meant the boat had to leave immediately,''
said spokesman Tony Mansour.
   For the past three months the Santa Maria has been the only
passenger vessel connecting the 310-square-mile beleaguered
Christian enclave northeast of Beirut with the outside world. In
May, slower passenger ferry operators decided it was too dangerous
to continue sailing to Jounieh.
   By police count, the 5-month-old confrontation between Christian
and Moslem forces has killed 778 people and wounded 2,092. All but
150,000 of Beirut's 1.5 million residents have fled the bomb-ravaged
city.
   Iraqi officials said the meeting in Baghdad was called to revive
faltering Arab mediation to end the fighting and find a settlement
to Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war.
   The current round of fighting broke out March 8 after Aoun
blockaded illegal ports operated by Syria's militia allies south of
Beirut in an abortive bid to restore state authority.
   Syria and its allies retaliated by besieging the Christian
enclave, where about 1 million people live.
   Iraq, Syria's main Arab rival, has been arming Aoun's forces to
thwart Syrian ambitions in Lebanon. The Syrians say Lebanon is vital
to their security and have long considered it part of ``Greater
Syria.''
   Iraq has supported Aoun's demand the Syrians withdraw the 40,000
troops they have in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping
mandate. Aoun says the Syrians have betrayed that mandate by
fighting alongside the Moslems.
   Arafat has been feuding with Syrian President Hafez Assad since
1983 over control of the Palestinian cause. Jordan, which reconciled
with Syria two years ago after a lengthy rift, is allied with Iraq
in the Arab Cooperation Council.
   Meanwhile, French envoy Alain Decaux held talks with Aoun in the
general's bunker under the shell-battered presidential palace in
suburban Baabda, east of Beirut.
   Decaux, who arrived in Lebanon Thursday, refused to talk to
reporters about his mission.
   France, which ruled Lebanon until 1943 and has long been seen by
the Christians as their main protector, has begun a new diplomatic
initiative to secure a cease-fire.

   Fire apparently started by a faulty
television set raced through a home this morning, killing four
children, police and firefighters said.
   Killed in the early-morning blaze on the city's north side were
Mary Massey, 11, Paula Massey, 10, Rena Hines, 12, and Lena
Ferguson, 6.
   The 6-year-old was visiting the other three children, whose
parents, James Massey and Patricia Hines, managed to escape, said
Syracuse Police Investigator Rod Carr.
   Carr said all four children were found dead by firefighters in a
bedroom on the second floor of the home shortly after 5 a.m. The
parents woke up when they smelled smoke but were unable to get
upstairs to the children, authorities said.
   There were no smoke detectors in the home, which was engulfed in
flames when firefighters arrived. Fire investigators believe the
fire started in a faulty television set, Carr said.
   ``I can't say it would have made a difference, but the parents
woke up after they smelled smoke,'' said Deputy Fire Chief Richard
Buck. ``Smoke detectors might have given them a few more minutes.''

   A judge found fashion designer Hattie
Belkin in contempt of court after learning she ran an advertisement
offering cash to men who would tell her they underwent vasectomies
performed by her estranged husband.
   Oakland County Circuit Judge Francis X. O'Brien also ordered
Wednesday that Ms. Belkin pay $1,000 to her husband, Dr. Richard
Belkin. The couple own Hattie boutiques, featuring Ms. Belkin's
designs, in Palm Beach, Fla.; the Detroit suburb of Birmingham; and
Scottsdale, Ariz.
   As part of the couple's bitter divorce proceeding, O'Brien had
ordered Ms. Belkin not to interfere with her husband's practice. The
judge said Ms. Belkin could go to jail if she interferes again.
   The contempt hearing was prompted by an advertisement Ms. Belkin
placed in the July 27 edition of the Northeast Detroiter, a weekly
newspaper. In it, she offered $25 payments for information about
vasectomies performed at her husband's clinic.
   Ms. Belkin placed the ad in an effort to determine her husband's
income, said her attorney, Mayer Morganroth. She would not comment
on Wednesday's hearing.
   O'Brien said he believed she acted out of frustration with the
couple's 2-year-old divorce case, scheduled to go to trial Sept. 7.
``Obviously, we are dealing with a lot of bucks,'' he said. ``The
point is, the longer it takes, the more frustrating it becomes.''
   The couple's single largest asset is the boutique chain.

<TEXT>
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole said today
there are ``some tough days ahead'' for Poland despite enthusiasm
over the emergence of the nation's first non-communist government in
almost half a century.
   Dole spoke just before he and his wife, Labor Secretary Elizabeth
Dole, left on a 10-day trip to Poland and three other countries from
Andrews Air Force Base in suburban Maryland.
   In Warsaw, the Doles will deliver letters from President Bush to
Polish President Wojciech Jaruzelski and Solidarity leader Lech
Walesa.
   In Kennebunkport, Maine, where Bush is vacationing, White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the letters were ``letters of
greeting'' from Bush to Walesa and the government leaders in the
countries the Doles are visiting.
   Fitzwater said the letters merely conveyed the president's best
wishes and were not policy oriented.
   The couple is also scheduled to visit earthquake-torn Soviet
Armenia, where they will deliver relief and rehabilitation supplies
furnished by Project Hope, a private charitable organization.
   The trip to Poland comes in the wake of the naming of a new prime
minister in Warsaw.
   Asked how he views the situation, Dole said, ``I think right now
it's a time of great excitement and expectations. But I do believe
that if you look at it realistically, there are some tough days
ahead.''
   ``When Solidarity in effect joins the government, there will also
be some who will hold Solidarity leaders including Lech Walesa
responsible _ either give them credit or discredit, depending on
what happens with the economy,'' Dole said.
   While in Poland next Thursday and Friday, Mrs. Dole will talk
with government and Solidarity officials about implementation of
U.S. technical assistance programs announced during Bush's recent
visit to Poland.
   The couple will visit Morocco and will wind up their trip Aug. 28
with a visit to the Netherlands and talks with Queen Beatrix.
   At least 25,000 people were killed in the Dec. 7 earthquake in
Armenia that injured 31,000 and left more than 100,000 homeless.
   Project Hope, based in Millwood, Va., said the Doles would
deliver medical equipment and supplies valued at $50,000.
   Also visiting the Soviet Union next week will be a congressonal
delegation exploring ways of increasing U.S. agricultural exports to
the Soviets.
   Leading the delegation will be Rep. Kika de la Garza, D-Texas,
who said the visit would let the Americans ``see first-han the
progress of Mr. (Mikhail) Gorbachev's economic reforms, particularly
in the agricultural sector.''

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski was booed and followed down
the street by a pack of screaming senior citizens as he left a
meeting with community leaders opposed to his stance on federal
health insurance.
   Several dozen people shouted ``Liar!'' ``Impeach!'' and
``Recall!'' Thursday, when the Democratic chairman of the House Ways
and Means Committee left a community center in the Northwest Side
Chicago district that for 30 years has sent him to Congress.
   The group followed him down the street and briefly blocked his
car, hitting it with picket signs and pounding on the windows.
Rostenkowski got out of the car and briskly walked about a block,
with the seniors in pursuit, until the driver brought the car to a
gas station and the congressman was able to get back in.
   The car sped away with its tires screeching.
   As he walked down the street, Rostenkowski said, ``I don't think
they understand what's going on. That's too bad.''
   The incident occurred after Rostenkowski discussed his support
for the catastrophic health care law during a private, 90-minute
meeting with representatives of six senior citizens organizations.
   The law set up a supplemental insurance medical plan for senior
citizens and has triggered objections because it requires seniors to
pay a surtax on their income taxes for the coverage.
   In response to complaints, Rostenkowski's committee last month
approved revisions in the program that would reduce the surtax for
many of the elderly, but would increase it for some lower-income
elderly.
   Rostenkowski refused to stop and talk to a larger group of people
after the meeting because he felt many of them ``just wanted to vent
their frustration, not talk about the issues,'' an aide said.
   ``They were just going to boo him,'' the aide said.
   The congressman left the meeting and made his way through 200
people outside the private meeting room. Some followed him to the
street.
   ``Talk to us! Talk to us! You work for us!'' they yelled.
   Jerry Prete, president of the Illinois State Council of Senior
Citizens, said the meeting with senior representatives idn't go
well, either.
   He said Rostenkowski wasn't receptive to suggestions made during
the session.
   ``We think this man is inhumane,'' said Lawrence Dobson, 67, who
was part of the gathering outside the building. ``He's not answering
the questions or needs of the people. Is he afraid of senior
citizens?''
   The catastrophic coverage law requires most of the elderly to pay
a surtax on their income taxes for coverage. It was intended as a
way of shielding the elderly from the rocketing medical bills of a
major illness. But opponents complain that it requires middle-income
retirees to pay unusually high tax rates.
   If the Ways and Means Committee proposals to revise the program
are approved by Congress and the president, the surtax would be
reduced for many elderly taxpayers. But for an elderly couple with
an income of $15,000 to $20,000, the annual cost for catastrophic
insurance would go up.
   Prete said members of his group believe they should not have to
pay any premium, arguing that farmers get bailouts, savings and
loans are rescued, and those and others benefiting from government
fix-its don't pay extra taxes.
   ``Why should senior citizens as a single group be taxed at a
higher rate?'' he said.

   President Bush is not considering expanding the
$119 million economic aid package he has proposed for Poland despite
the non-communist government taking shape in the East bloc nation,
his spokesman said today.
   Asked in Kennebunkport, Maine, where Bush is vacationing, whether
the changes in Poland would justify more financial incentives,
presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater told reporters: ``It's
really premature to think along those lines.''
   He also said he administration would have no comment on reports
of the selection of Tadeusz Mazowiecki, editor of the newspaper of
the independent trade union Solidarity, as the new prime minister
until the parliamentary process is completed and the new leaders are
ratified.
   ``The situation is changing rapidly there,'' Fitzwater said. ``We
would prefer not to have any further comment on the process until we
have some assurances on how the government is going to be formed.''
   Meeting last month with Bush in Poland, Solidarity chairman Lech
Welesa asked for $10 billion in U.S. aid to rebuild the Polish
economy, which is saddled with a $39 billion debt to Western
governments and banks.
   Bush responded with the $119 million package that will include
$100 million over three years for loans to Poles trying to start
capitalist enterprises; $5 million to clean pollution in Krakow and
$4 million to be spent through the U.S. Labor Department to study
social and work issues in Poland.
   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole and her husband, Senate Republican
leader Bob Dole, left Washington today on a 10-day trip that wil
include meetings with officials in Poland next week.
   Sen. Dole said, ``I think right now it's a time of great
excitement and expectations. But I do believe that if you look at it
realistically, there are some tough days ahead.''
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Thursday that the
administration was still drafting proposed legislation on the
president's aid package for presentation to Congress when it returns
from recess next month.
   Fitzwater on Thursday described the political change in Poland as
``a sensitive situation there in terms of the general movement away
from the communist control.''
   Bush does not want ``to do anything or say anything to upset the
apple cart. ... We're very reluctant to involve ourselves in a more
direct fashion,'' he said.
   ``Certainly a non-communist government would be a remarkable and
history-making occurrence,'' Fitzwater said.
   But one senior administration official described the mood as
jubilant.
   ``Two years ago, no one in the United States would have predicted
this could happen. Of course we're happy, extremely happy,'' said
the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   ``These changes are the most important upheavals in Eastern
Europe and in the Soviet world since the death of Stalin,'' Zbigniew
Brzezinski, a native of Poland who was former President Carter's
national security adviser, said today on ``CBS This Morning.'' ``And
they have enormous implications for the future of communism and the
East-West relations. ... We are seeing the end of an entire era.''
   State Department spokesman Boucher issued a statement clearly
designed to warn the Kremlin not to invoke the Brezhnev doctrine,
used in the past to justify the use of force to prevent assertion of
greater independence by Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
   ``Poland faces a difficult period of transition from a state
dominated by one party to a more pluralistic and democratic system.
The process must be managed within Poland,'' Boucher said.
   ``We emphasize that this continues to be a matter for the Polish
people to decide,'' he said.
   Asked whether his statement was aimed at Moscow, Boucher would
say only: ``You know as well as I do what the history of Poland is.''
   One specialist on Soviet affairs predicted Gorbachev would ``grin
and bear'' the formation of a non-communist government in Poland,
unless he chose to jeopardize his own reforms and efforts to improve
relations with the West.
   ``The test of how far Gorbachev is willing to let things go in
Eastern Europe has come earlier than anyone expected,'' said Leon
Aron, a scholar of Soviet affairs at the conservative Heritage
Foundation in Washington.
   But as long Walesa does not humiliate Poland's communists or try
to withdraw from the Kremlin-led Warsaw Pact military alliance,
``Gorbachev may have to grin and bear it,'' Aron said.
   ``Gorbachev also realizes that any attempt at stopping these
developments in Poland would mean violence, major threat to
East-West relations and ultimately, probably, he would dig his own
grave within the Soviet Union,'' said Brzezinski.
   Polish emigres were less confident.
   ``It seems to be too good to be true,'' said Zdislaw Rurarz, who
defected from his post as Polish ambassador to Tokyo when communist
authorities declared martial law and suppressed Solidarity on Dec.
13, 1981.
   ``I cannot imagine that the U.S.S.R. has abandoned Poland and is
ready to end its domination of that country,'' Rurarz said in a
telephone interview.
   ``All depends on the reaction from Moscow,'' said Jan Nowak, an
emigre Pole who fought the Nazis and the communists for control of
Poland before fleeing his homeland after World War II.

   Argentina and Britain will hold talks next
month in Madrid aimed at restoring diplomatic ties that were severed
during the 1982 Falklands war, the two nations announced today.
   The talks will be held Oct. 17-18, according to a joint
communique by British Ambassdasor Sir Crispin Tickell and the
director-general of Argentina's Foreign Ministry, Lucio Garcia del
Solar.
   The two men met in New York to discuss the timing, agenda and
conditions for future discussions between the two countries. The
diplomatic level of the talks in Madrid was to be decided later.
   The comminique said the Madrid meeting will cover
British-Argentine relations, including the future of diplomatic and
consular ties.
   In April 1982, Argentina invaded the islands it calls the
Malvinas, where 2,000 people of British descent live.
   Britain, which calls the islands the Falklands, counterattacked
and defeated Argentina in a six-week war that cost almost 1,000
lives.

   Former Rep. John Jenrette today was sentenced
to 30 days in jail and fined $2,000 for stealing a necktie and shoes
from a discount department store.
   The former South Carolina Democratic congressman was also put on
two years probation, told to do 200 hours of community service and
to continue psychiatric and alcoholism treatment.
   ``I apologize to the court,'' Jenrette said in the courtroom in
this Washington suburb. ``I can only say that I'll never be back.
Why I let this happen, I don't know. I've totally wiped out all of
my income and have lost all hopes of getting my law license back.''
   Jenrette, 53, served 13 months in prison after he was convicted
in 1980 of bribery in the Abscam affair. He is still on probation
from that conviction and it is not clear how today's sentence will
affect his federal conviction.
   Jenrette was convicted on two counts of petty larceny for
switching price tags at a discount department store on Dec. 7.
   Two security guards from the store testified during the trial
that they saw Jenrette steal the items.
   The former lawmaker claimed the incident was all a mistake. He
testified that he brought his own tie into the store to compare it
with the one he was thinking of buying, and Rosemary Long, his
self-described girlfriend, said she saw the tie in his car trunk a
week before the incident.

   A man just out of jail for child abuse
held his wife and eight children hostage for more than six hours,
terrorizing them by playing Russian roulette, before killing the
woman and himself, police said.
   The children, between 1 and 13 years old, were safe after
Thursday's standoff. The gunman, Dang Cha Xiong, a Laotian refugee,
died about two hours later at a hospital. His wife, Bao Cha, died at
the scene.
   A ninth child, a 12-year-old boy, had escaped from the apartment
and alerted police that Dang was holding the nine hostages. The boy
who escaped, and one of the eight children held hostage, were both
family friends, while the other seven children were Dang's children,
authorities said.
   The boy said Dang was playing Russian roulette with his hostages,
sticking a bullet in the cylinder of his .38-caliber revolver and
pulling the trigger at random, said Lt. Andy Jackson.
   Police spoke with Dang for several hours and he sounded
cooperative, said Lucian Neely, deputy police chief. But after Dang
said he would surrender and lay down his gun, police heard four
shots.
   Officers rushed the apartment and found the children in a front
room and the two wounded parents in a rear bedroom. Police fired no
shots during the siege, Neely said.
   Dang, 35, had been involved in a longstanding feud with his
wife's parents, Neely said.
   He previously had been arrested and convicted for child abuse,
Sgt. Dennis Sanford said. He had been released from jail Thursday
morning.
   Officers said a court order had restrained him from visiting the
family apartment in the Tyrolean Village district north of the
downtown where many refugees from Southeast Asia live.
   On Jan. 17, five children of Southeast Asian refugees were killed
and 30 other people wounded on a Stockton schoolyard by a man who
then shot himself to death in this city 75 miles east of San
Francisco.

<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl and East German
leader Erich Honecker have agreed to high-level negotiations to deal
with a crush of East German refugees at West German embassies,
officials said today.
   Bonn government spokesman Herbert Schmuelling told reporters Kohl
received a letter from Honecker on Thursday night in reply to a West
German letter earlier this week pressing for joint efforts in the
refugee situation.
   A meeting between Kohl and Honecker has not been ruled out, but
government sources said the talks would likely be handled by other
senior authorities.
   Kohl said in a television interview today he was prepared to meet
with Honecker personally, if necessary to ease the ``strained'' ties
between the two countries.
   Schmuelling refused to say what Honecker's letter said but
confirmed that a meeting of East and West German officials ``at a
high level'' was in the works.
   Kohl's chief of staff, Rudolf Seiters, arrived in East Berlin
today, according to reporters there. Government sources who spoke on
condition of anonymity said Seiters would meet with East German
Deputy Foreign Minister Herbert Krolikowski to discuss the refugee
problem.
   More than 300 East Germans seeking to emigrate are being
sheltered at West Germany's embassies in Budapest, East Berlin,
Prague and Warsaw.
   The Foreign Ministry closed its embassy in Budapest on Monday
because the refugees had overwhelmed the facility. Another 300 or
more East Germans have arrived since the gates were locked and have
taken shelter with international aid groups at churches and
temporary encampments.
   East Germans frustrated with the lack of reform in their
Communist-governed country have been pouring out by the hundreds
this summer through neighboring Hungary, which began dismantling its
barbed-wire border with Austria in May.
   Most of those holed up at Bonn's embassies in Eastern Europe are
East Germans who were caught trying to escape to Austria from
Hungary.
   Hungarian border guards have noted the failed escape attempts in
the passports of many of those caught, and East Germans fearing
punishment if they return home have appealed to West Germany for
help.

   The leader of a United Nations
fact-finding team said Friday that Thailand's help would be needed
if an international force is dispatched to Cambodia to help bring
peace to that country.
   Lt. Gen. Martin O. Vadset also thanked Prime Minister Chatichai
Choonhavan for assistance during the team's inspection tour of the
Thai-Cambodian border.
   The 15-member team departs Saturday after spending a week inside
Cambodia and three days at the frontier. The team was dispatched by
an international conference in Paris that is trying to bring peace
to Cambodia.
   Vadset declined to say what the team would report to the
conference Monday.
   Vadset's task was to lay the groundwork for a group to monitor
the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia and perhaps act as
a peacekeeping force.
   A three-party Cambodian coalition is fighting the pro-Hanoi
government in Cambodia and the Vietnamese army, which invaded
Cambodia in late 1978. There are fears the fighting could escalate
after the pullout of the Vietnamese.
   Without citing details, Vadset said Thailand's assistance would
be needed if an international force went into Cambodia.

   Highly successful trials of the antiviral drug
AZT suggest that AIDS may soon become ``a treatable disease''
instead of a hopeless infection, federal officials say.
   The announcement is ``a major turning point in the AIDS
epidemic,'' said Jean McGuire, director of the AIDS Action Council,
an advocacy group for AIDS patients.
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan announced
Thursday that trials of AZT on one group of patients who have the
AIDS virus, but no symptoms, proved that the drug can halt
progression of the infection.
   ``We are indeed entering the period when AIDS may become a
treatable disease,'' Sullivan said at a news conference where the
AZT drug trial results were announced.
   However, he cautioned: ``AZT is not a cure and, indeed, even
those who are under AZT treatment remain capable of transmitting the
disease.''
   Findings of the drug trials on early-infected patients who show
no symptoms prompted federal officials to stop the trials so that
all participants can receive AZT. The drug trial had required
one-third of the 1,300 in the study to receive a placebo, or sugar
pill.
   Patients in the trial were in the early stages of infection by
the human immunedeficiency virus, or HIV, that causes AIDS.
   In effect, they were feeling well and were symptom-free, but they
had a damaged immune system as measured by the numbers of T4
lymphocytes, a type of immune cells, in the blood. An AZT trial
continues for patients in an even earlier stage of infection and
with even less immune system damage.
   AZT, also known as zidovudine, is marketed by Burroughs Wellcome
Co. under the brand name Retrovir. It formally was known by the name
azidothymidine, which was shortened in popular use to AZT.
   Thursday's announcement marks the third time that formal trials
of AZT have been modified after the drug demonstrated its
effectiveness against AIDS in selected patient groups.
   Two weeks ago, a trial was stopped among patients with a stage of
the disease called AIDS-related complex, or ARC. Earlier, the
government halted trials among profoundly infected AIDS patients. In
both cases the trials were stopped so that those participants
getting placebo could start receiving the drug.
   An AZT trial continues among AIDS patients whose blood immune
system is still healthy but who test positive for infection by the
human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which causes AIDS. This group
would be at an even earlier stage of the disease.
   Sullivan said the new trial results, along with those from the
two earlier trials, provide ``real hope for the millions of people
worldwide who are infected with HIV.''
   Ms. McGuire said in a prepared statement, ``For the millions of
Americans who have waited to be tested for HIV because there was no
medical assistance available, today's announcement should be reason
for people to rethink that decision.''
   The HHS secretary said he is ordering that Medicare patients
receiving AZT be reimbursed for the cost of the drug. AZT, which
must be taken six times daily, costs $7,000 to $8,000 a year per
patient.
   Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases, the lead federal clinical agency in
fighting AIDS, said that with Thursday's announcement about 400,000
more patients may be prescribed AZT. Even though the drug is not
approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use among mildly
infected patients, it could be prescribed for such patients at
doctors' discretion, he said.
   The earlier trials opened use of the drug to about 200,000
patients, making a total of 600,000 who may now take AZT, Fauci said.
   Sullivan said the FDA will consider the new drug trial results
and may modify the approved uses of AZT to include those mildly
infected. This action, however, could take months, he said.
   In the study concluded Thursday, one-third of the patients
received 1,500 milligrams daily of AZT, a third took 500 mg daily
and a third got sugar pills. The study was conducted at 32 centers
in 16 states and the District of Columbia.
   Fauci said the results showed that among those taking the
placebo, 38 patients developed symptoms of AIDS or of ARC. Among
those on high doses of AZT, 19 developed the disease symptoms, and
among those on the low doses, 17 developed symptoms.
   ``This is a very important step in the scientific certification
of what we had been hoping for,'' Fauci said. ``We're not talking
about a cure, but we're talking about a very important step in
delaying the progression of the disease.''
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome attacks the body's immune
system and renders it incapable of protecting against infection. The
disease is caused by the HIV virus and is spread most frequently
through sexual contact, the sharing of needles and syringes, and
from mother to newborn infant.
   New figures released Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control
show there have been 102,621 cases of AIDS diagnosed in the United
States since 1981. A total of 59,391 U.S. patients have died.
   There is no cure for AIDS and no one is known to have recovered
completely from the viral infection.

   A free-lance photographer from
West Germany who was arrested on a weapons charge was granted bail
Friday and ordered to stay out of Northern Ireland.
   A high court judge said that Nick Vogel of West Berlin would be
permitted to return to the British province only for court
appearances. Bail was set at about $1,560.
   Vogel, 22, was arrested early Tuesday in West Belfast, and was
charged with possession of a rifle magazine under suspicious
circumstances.
   Police said the magazine was from a .22-caliber semiautomatic
carbine. They said said a search of a Vogel's car also turned up
flares, knives, 17 firecrackers, two plastic containers of petrol, a
pouch with three six-inch steel darts and information on martial
arts.
   Police said Vogel had said the magazine was from a rifle he
owned, and that he kept it in the car to hit the starter motor when
it stuck.
   Vogel, who did not speak during the hearing, has said he was in
Belfast on assignment from Stern magazine.

   President Wojciech Jaruzelski has chosen
Solidarity activist Tadeusz Mazowiecki to be the new prime minister
and lead the East bloc's first non-communist government, a
government source said today.
   ``I can expect such an offer. I am ready to accept it,''
Mazowiecki told reporters after meeting with Jaruzelski this morning.
   A highly placed state official said that during the meeting,
Jaruzelski chose Mazowiecki from three Solidarity-backed candidates
and would offer him the prime minister's post. The Sejm, or
parliament, where a Solidarity-backed alliance has a firm majority,
must approve Jaruzelski's choice.
   Mazowiecki, 62, whose name is pronounced mah-zoh-vee-ET-skee, is
a journalist who spent time in jail for his anti-government
activities. He refused to give details of his meeting with the
president, saying only that it concerned ``all important topics.''
   ``There are huge troubles, huge problems. It won't be easy,''
Mazowiecki said of the prime minister's post. ``I am afraid of many
things, but if I were only afraid, I would be a total pessimist.
Somebody has to try it.''
   The new government will be the first non-communist government in
Poland in 45 years and inherits an economy wracked by inflation,
shortages and a $39 billion foreign debt.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said today President Bush
was not considering increasing the $119 million economic aid package
proposed for Poland, despite the non-communist government taking
shape. Fitzwater said the Bush administration would not comment on
the new prime minister until the nomination was ratified.
   There was no immediate comment from the Soviet Union, which has
expressed concern about the changes in Poland but promised not to
interfere.
   The Polish government official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said a formal announcement on Jaruzelski's choice would
be made Saturday. The Communist Party Central Committee also is
scheduled to meet Saturday.
   Mazowiecki is editor of the Solidarity weekly newspaper Tygodnik
Solidarnosc. The other candidates recommended by Solidarity were
Jacek Kuron, a Solidarity lawmaker, and Bronislaw Geremek,
Solidarity's parliamentary leader.
   The once inconceivable idea of a government without a Communist
Party member at the helm became possible after Solidarity leader
Lech Walesa persuaded two small parties that hold the balance of
power in the Sejm to join Solidarity in a coalition.
   That resulted in the communist alliance losing its majority in
the Sejm.
   On Thursday, the Communist prime minister, Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak,
resigned after trying two weeks to form a government.
   The same day, Jaruzelski met with Walesa, reportedly agreed to
the coalition idea and agreed to pick a member of the trade union he
once outlawed to lead it.
   Walesa, who in April realized his goal of reviving Solidarity
after a seven-year ban, had said he did not want the job.
   Even in a government led by Solidarity, Jaruzelski will remain
president, controlling the army and foreign affairs; local
governments will still be in the hands of the Communist Party; and
party members will control the courts. In addition, tens of
thousands of Poland's bureaucrats owe their jobs to the party, and
75 percent of management jobs _ ranging from shop managers to
factory heads _ are held by party members.
   Mazowiecki was the least known of the candidates put forward by
Walesa, but his relation to Solidarity dates to the first days of
the August 1980 strikes in Gdansk that gave birth to the trade union.
   He organized a petition of support among intellectuals for the
strikers, than stayed on with the workers as an adviser.
   Mazowiecki was at Walesa's side last year when a wave of strikes
began and led to government-opposition talks on democratic reforms.
   Those talks ended in Solidarity being legalized again and led to
Poland's most democratic elections, which allowed Solidarity to
enter government.
   In the June vote, Solidarity-backed candidates swept all but one
seat available to the opposition in the Sejm and newly formed
Senate. The accord guaranteed the Communist Party a majority, but it
lost the upper hand when its traditional allies, the Democratic and
United Peasant parties, defected to Solidarity this week.
   In an apparent effort to reassure Poland's Warsaw Pact allies,
Walesa Thursday reiterated his view that Poland's membership in the
Soviet-led alliance was not in jeopardy.
   Under his proposal, the communists should retain control of the
defense and interior ministries, which oversee the army and police.
   ``We are members of the Warsaw Pact and therefore have certain
responsibilities,'' he told West German television.
   Back in 1980, the creation of Solidarity, the Soviet bloc's first
independent trade union, unnerved the Soviet Union, then ruled by
Communist Party leader Leonid Brezhnev.
   The union was legal for 16 months and had swelled to 10 million
members when martial law was declared Dec. 13, 1981. Thousands of
union supporters were jailed, and Parliament banned Solidarity the
next year.
   Before Solidarity, Mazowiecki was active in independent Catholic
circles helped found the Club of Catholic Intelligentsia in Warsaw
in 1957.
   He was part of the ZNAK group, which managed under church
protection to serve as a focal point for thinking independent of
communist ideology in Poland in the 1960s and 1970s. The group was
permitted a few seats in Parliament, and Mazowiecki held one from
1961 to 1971.
   Mazowiecki was editor of the Catholic literary and political
monthly Wiez from 1958 until 1981 when he founded Tygodnik
Solidarnosc. The weekly was banned after martial law but Mazowiecki
resurrected it this year.

   The Agriculture Department said Friday it is
expanding its recent ban on ostrich imports to include related
flightless birds such as emus, rheas and cassowaries because they
may carry disease-bearing parasites.
   Larry B. Slagle, acting administrator of the department's Animal
and Plant Health Inspection Service, said the expanded import ban
was effective immediately and would remain indefinitely.
   ``We must curtail the entry of flightless birds into the United
States until further notice to ensure that these birds do not
introduce disease-carrying parasites to U.S. livestock,'' he said.
   The flightless birds affected by the ban are known as ratites and
include ostriches, emus, rheas and cassowaries. These birds have
only small or rudimentary wings.
   An agency spokeswoman, Marlene Stinson, said the import ban does
not apply to penguins because those are of a different family.
Neither will the ban affect kiwis, because the bird's homeland, New
Zealand, does not permit exports, she said.
   Interest in ostrich farming has grown rapidly, and so have
imports. Stinson said no ostriches were imported in 1986 but that
348 entered the United States in 1987, 537 in 1988, and 825 through
July 31 of this year.
   At present, sales of chicks and adult ostriches are confined
primarily to other breeders, who envision a potential market for
ostrich hide and meat.
   Slagle said the crackdown on imports was prompted by the
discovery earlier this year of 18 exotic ticks on adult ostriches in
Ohio, Oklahoma and Texas.
   The ticks were identified as African Bont and Bont-legged ticks,
which are known to transmit heartwater, an often fatal disease of
cattle, sheep, goats and other ruminants. No further tick findings
have been reported.
   Slagle said the disease does not affect humans and does not exist
in the United States.
   On July 5, the USDA agency announced it had stopped issuing
import permits for ostriches as a result of the tick threat and was
reviewing import inspection methods and quarantine standards.
   Slagle said the official rule-making publication of the new
import curbs will be Aug. 21. Public comments can be sent by Oct. 20
to: Chief, Regulatory Analysis and Development, PPD, APHIS, USDA,
Room 866, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD

   Police opened fire today on
black employees outside a pie factory where they had been locked out
by management. At least 15 workers were injured, police and union
officials said.
   Police also arrested an anti-apartheid activist and banned a Cape
Town rally called for Sunday by outlawed rights organizations.
   In another development, Trevor Tutu, son of Nobel Prize-winning
Archbishop Desmond Tutu, was sentenced today to 18 months in prison
for allegedly making a false bomb threat at Johannesburg's
international airport.
   Mohammed Valli Moosa, an official of the banned United Democratic
Front and a leader of a new campaign to defy apartheid restrictions,
was arrested at his Johannesburg office today and held there as
security police searched his files.
   Police ordered journalists from the building after the reporters
saw Valli Moosa in custody and were told he was under arrest.
   There was no immediate indication what charges might be filed
against Valli Moosa, one of three activists who escaped from
detention last year and took sanctuary at the U.S. Consulate in
Johannesburg.
   Another escapee, Murphy Morobe, said Valli Moosa's arrest
violated the government's promise that the three were free to leave
the consulate without fear of being arrested again.
   ``It shows how easy it is for the government to go back on its
word,'' said Morobe, who called on the U.S. government to condemn
the arrest.
   The Food and Allied Workers Union said scores of workers
assembled early today outside the Mama's Pies factory on
Johannesburg's southeastern outskirts, a day after the company
locked them out because of a 4-week-old wage dispute.
   The union said police used whips and live ammunition to disperse
the workers and made several arrests. The union said 15 workers were
injured, some seriously.
   Capt. Reg Crewe, a spokesman at police headquarters in Pretoria,
said police acted only after workers began pulling on the locked
factory gates and ingored an order to disperse. He said officers
initially used whips, but fired shotguns when some fleeing workers
threw stones.
   He said four people were slightly injured by the shotgun fire and
15 others suffered minor injuries while being dispersed. He said no
one was arrested.
   It was the second violent labor clash in two days.
   On Thursday, police said at least 10 people were injured outside
the British-owned Eveready plant in Port Elizabeth in clashes
between striking workers and people recruited to fill their jobs.
   Crewe, asked about the banned Cape Town rally, said he did not
know if similar rallies planned for Sunday in other cities also
would be banned.
   Desmond Tutu said the ban was ``inflammatory and dangerous'' and
called for an alternative rally at his church in Cape Town.
   Tutu's 32-year-old son, Trevor, was convicted of violating the
Aviation Act by falsely telling police that there was a bomb in his
luggage. He had pleaded innocent and said he would appeal the
conviction.
   Shortly after the Dec. 31 incident at Jan Smuts Airport, Trevor
Tutu convened a news conference and told reporters he deliberately
courted arrest as part of a publicity stunt on behalf of his
advertising agency.
   He also was convicted on three counts of criminal injury and
fined $440 for allegedly interfering with police last year when they
tried to arrest a friend of his on suspicion of drunken driving.
   In 1984, Trevor Tutu was held by police for three days before he
was cleared of a charge of drunken driving. In 1985, he was briefly
detained after arguing with police at a courthouse about the
detention of black children.
   Tutu's father is leader of the Anglican Church in southern Africa
and one of the country's most prominent anti-apartheid activists.
There was no immediate comment from the archbishop about his son's
conviction.
   The United Democratic Front, a nationwide coalition of activist
organizations, and 16 other anti-apartheid groups last year were
ordered to halt all activities. They intended to declare themselves
legal on Sunday, the front's sixth anniversary.
   The rallies were organized as part of a nationwide campaign of
defiance. In other phases of the campaign, blacks have sought
treatment at segregated white hospitals and dozens of activists have
defied restrictions imposed on them following their recent release
from imprisonment.

<HEAD>U.N. Says Border Crossing Endangers Armistice Agreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.N. command said Friday a border
crossing at Panmunjom by two South Korean dissidents returning from
North Korea threatens the armistice in effect on the divided
peninsula since 1953.
   ``Most critically, the North Koreans' unilateral decision to
allow the transit puts in question their adherence to the armistice
itself,'' said a statement by the U.S.-led command, which represents
nations that supported South Korea in the 1950-53 war.
   A spokesman said the statement was intended to clarify the
command's position. He did not say what action, if any, would be
taken.
   Im Su-kyong, a raducal student, and the Rev. Moon Gyu-hyun
returned home Tuesday after visiting North Korea illegally and were
arrested immediately by South Korean authorities. The command said
they crossed the border at Panmunjom without proper authorization.
   South Korea accused North Korea of ``intentional provocation''
and using Panmunjom for propaganda purposes.
   In its statement, the U.N. Command also said North Korea had
brought hundreds of people to the demilitarized zone for
demonstrations in July and August against the United States and
South Korea.
   ``The North deliberately altered the rules, thus introducing
uncertainty and raising tensions in a sensitive area where the
potential for confrontation and violence is always high,'' it said.
   North Korea denied the crossing was illegal. It said the
armistice agreement applied only to foreigners or people wishing to
enter the territory under control of the other side, and ``it is
natural for Ms. Im and Moon to go back to their residence area.''
   The U.N. Command says any person, military or civilian, who
crosses the border must have specific authoritization from the
Military Armistice Commission that supervises implementation of the
agreement.
   It pointed out that many Koreans from both sides had crossed in
the past by mutual agreement, but that South Korea had not given
permission for the dissidents to do so.

<HEAD>Pardons Board Rejects Plea For Clemency in `Hi-Fi' Murder</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Note language in last graf.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The state Board of Pardons today rejected a
plea for clemency from convicted ``Hi-Fi'' murderer William Andrews,
scheduled to die by injection early Tuesday after nearly 15 years on
death row.
   The board's 2-1 decision left the nation's longest-standing
resident of death row with pending appeals in state and federal
courts of his 1974 conviction for torturing and murdering three
people during a stereo store robbery in Ogden.
   In all, five people were forced to drink caustic drain cleaner
and were then shot in the head; two survived the August 1974 attack.
   Board Chairman H.L. Haun and panel member Edward Kimball decided
that although Andrews did not shoot the victims, his help in forcing
them to drink the drain cleaner and his knowledge that co-defendant
Pierre Dale Selby intended to kill them made commutation of the
death sentence impossible.
   The aggravating circumstances of the crime known as the ``Hi-Fi
murders'' _ one of the most notorious in modern Utah history _ far
outweighed any mitigating factors, Haun said.
   After the drain cleaner was administered, ``When the victims did
not die quickly enough, the decision was made to shoot the victims.
Mr. Andrews waited outside while this took place, but he left his
loaded pistol for Mr. Selby to use,'' Haun said.
   ``Mr. Andrews knew of Mr. Selby's intent and shared in it,'' he
said.
   Selby was executed by injection in August 1987 after the pardons
panel unanimously rejected his plea for commutation.
   Board member Victoria Palacios voted to commute, saying that
while Andrews' culpability was undeniable, ``I would commute the
death sentence and recommend he never be paroled.''
   Andrews, 34, a Jonesboro, La., native, showed no emotion. While
being led from the hearing room at Utah State Prison, however,
Andrews said, ``I thank Miss Palacios for being fair and
considerate.''
   One of the survivors of the attack, Orren Walker, testified at
Andrews' and Selby's commutation hearings and wiped tears from his
face after today's decision. His son was among those killed.
   Pardon Board Administrator Paul Sheffield said the board received
thousands of letters and telegrams from throughout the world, 90
percent of them favoring clemency. Much of the mail has stemmed from
efforts of Amnesty International, which has made the case an example
in its effort to abolish capital punishment.
   In the appeals, Andrews contends his constitutional rights were
violated by being forced to accept as a public defender an
inexperienced attorney, and a judge's failure to instruct the jury
it could convict him of second-degree murder.
   The appeals also raised again the argument that a mistrial should
have been declared for Selby and Andrews, both black, when a juror
found a note bearing the words, ``Hang the niggers,'' during a lunch
break. There were no blacks on the jury; the sole potential black
juror was excluded.

   A Defense Department research program in which
cats are shot in the head to study war-related brain injuries is
inhumane, scientifically flawed and unnecessary, a group of doctors
said.
   The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine on Thursday
asked Defense Secretary Richard Cheney to cancel the contract for
the research, conducted at Louisiana State University Medical Center
in New Orleans.
   ``The study under question is superfluous and extraordinarily
expensive,'' Dr. Michael Sukoff, a member of the American Board of
Neurological Surgeons, said in a news release from Washington.
   The $2 million contract involves shooting hundreds of cats in the
head to learn how to return brain-injured soldiers to active duty,
thus conserving the fighting strength of the Army, the Physicians
Committee said.
   According to the news release, the primary conclusion by LSU
researchers is that respiration stops when the brain is wounded, a
reaction the doctors said has been documented in medical literature
for nearly 100 years.
   ``I am appalled by `research' which purports to study human brain
injury, but in fact only causes suffering in domestic cats,'' Dr.
Christopher Smith said.
   The physician's group is a national organization of 2,000 doctors
who promote preventive medicine and alternatives to animal research.
   Officials from LSU's School of Medicine said the department head
in charge of animal research was out of town and unavailable for
comment.

   San Nujoma, president of the South West
Africa People's Organization says he will return to Namibia in the

   Nujoma on Thursday night confirmed reports by the Angolan press

   He said he had received a ``signal'' from colleagues in Namibia
that the time had come for him to come home and ``mobilize'' the
Namibian people prior to elections Nov. 6 to select a constituent

dominated by SWAPO.
   Nujoma has visited several countries recently to discuss the
progress being made toward Namibian independence under the peace

<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with police chief killed in Medellin,
appeals for more security for judges faced with death threats. No pickup.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAVIER BAENA</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Five gunmen today killed a police chief
who led a crackdown on drug traffickers, attacking him after he sent
his bodyguards to protect court judges whose lives had been
threatened.
   The provincial police chief, Col. Waldemar Franklin Quintero, was
killed and his driver was wounded when the gunmen intercepted their
car and riddled it with automatic weapon fire, authorities and
witnesses said.
   Authorities blamed the killing on the Medellin cartel, the
world's largest cocaine ring which is believed responsible for about
80 percent of the cocaine smuggled into the United States.
   ``They fired without mercy for several minutes at the colonel,
who was hit more than 100 times,'' an unidentified witness told
Radio Caracol. ``His chauffer was seriously injured and taken to a
hospital.''
   The nation's judges went on strike Thursday to demand increased
protection. They struck after gunmen hired by drug dealers killed
magistrate Carlos Valencia Garcia in Bogota on Wednesday night. The
killing also prompted 48 magistrates in Bogota's Superior Court to
hand in their resignations.
   Valencia Garcia, 43, had rejected court motions to exonerate two
leaders of the Medellin cartel who were accused in the 1987 slaying
of a journalist.
   The defense minister, Gen. Oscar Botero, said today that soldiers
and police will increase protection for judges and intensify their
crackdown on the cocaine industry. He said police arrested 61 people
in 100 raids this week on suspected drug processing and smuggling
locations nationwide.
   They confiscated arms and, at a house in suburban Bogota, $7.7
million dollars in cash, gold, checks and jewelry, he said.
   Asked about the strike and Franklin Quintero's slaying, Justice
Minister Monica de Grieff said: ``It's terrifying what is happening
in Colombia.''
   ``The only way to confront this challenge is by fighting
together, the government, judges, the armed forces and the citizenry
to stop the wave of violence,'' she said in Bogota. She appealed to
the country's more than 4,000 judges and magistrates to end their
strike so traffickers don't ``achieve their goal of halting the
administration of justice.''
   The attack on Franklin Quintero occurred moments after he left
home.
   Witnesses said Franklin Quintero's car was severely damaged by
the rain of gunfire and that its interior was covered with blood.
   Franklin Quintero directed the local campaign against cocaine
trafficking and led several major raids that resulted in the seizure
of tons of the drug and the arrest of several dealers.
   Helena Herran de Montoya, the governor of Antioquia province,
where Medellin is located, said the colonel gave up his bodyguard
force because he ``thought it was more important to use this
personnel in protecting judges.''
   The attack was the latest in several drug-related killings in
Medellin, Colombia's second-largest city and its industrial center.
   In the last month, two officials investigating the activities of
cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar Gaviria have been slain. On Thursday
night, an armed band intercepted a police van carrying 18 people who
had been arrested and set them free. They included several suspected
drug traffickers, officials said.

   MTV has decided to air Cher's video ``If I Could
Turn Back Time'' at night only, saying the Oscar-winning actress
shows ``a little too much tush'' in the clip.
   ``When we accepted it, we felt it was borderline,'' Abbey
Konowitch, MTV vice president for programming, said Friday. ``We
received a great deal of negative feedback from our audience. In
response, we've changed the way we're programming it.''
   The video, which premiered six weeks ago on MTV, will only be
aired from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m., said Konowitch. The clip features Cher
_ wearing a thin, carefully-placed V-shaped outfit and sheer
stockings _ performing on the deck of a troop ship.
   Her manager, Bill Sammeth, said MTV's decision was like closing
the barn door after the horse was gone: ``They think it shows too
much of her, but they allowed it for eight weeks.''
   Konowitch, however, had the final word: ``The video has a little
too much tush for a Saturday morning.''

   Police at the original Woodstock music
festival arrested only about 80 people, on drug charges. At the 20th
anniversary celebration, there have been four citations issued _ on
tax charges.
   Agents from the state Department of Taxation and Finance raided
vendors selling memorabilia during celebrations around Bethel on
Thursday night and accused four of not collecting the required state
sales tax, said spokesman Paul Rickard.
   The vendors were hawking T-shirts, hats, beads and other items to
10,000 people gathered on the site of 1969 festival.
   The four were charged with failure to have a certificate of
authority, a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum fine of a year in
jail and up to a $10,000 fine.
   Rickard said the state would dispatch three or four tax agents to
the site Friday night.
   ``We'll be going in for the big one tonight,'' Rickard said. ``We
anticipate that tonight, because of many more vendors coming, we'll
be giving out more citations.''

   James Woods, known for his intense portrayals in
such movies as ``Salvador'' and ``The Onion Field,'' has used some
unusual techniques to prepare himself and his co-stars on the set.
   Like the time he ``whacked'' Robert Downey Jr. ``across the side
of the head and knocked him over, knocked his glasses across the
room,'' Woods told Smart magazine in its September-October issue.
   The moment came during the filming of ``True Believer.'' Downey
is ``a really great actor,'' Woods said, ``but he was missing the
magic that I knew he was capable of'' during a close-up. So Woods
whacked him. A stunned Downey finished the scene, then laughed.
   ``I hate to see anybody that brilliant not be really up to the
mark, you know what I mean? I just woke him up for a second,'' Woods
said.
   ``I would appreciate it if he did it for me. I can't really
remember if anybody has ever done anything like that to me.
   ``Bobby De Niro once sent me a pair of red high-heeled pumps from
Frederick's of Hollywood before I did a scene in `Once Upon a Time
in America,''' Woods recalled.
   ``So I just walked in, wearing my tux and my old-rubber-head
makeup and these big, fluffy, feathery, high-heeled, blazing-red
spiked heels. I think maybe I was being too serious or something,
and that kind of lightened me up a bit.''

   Less than a decade ago, a burly shipyard
electrican named Lech Walesa was in jail, the fledgling labor
organization he founded in ruins. Today, his popularity and the
stunning rebirth of the Solidarity movement have forced the
Communist Party to loosen its iron grip on the government.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lech Walesa strode into the Parliament
building, the sound of applause from opposition lawmakers filling
the hall that was once a mere cog in the Communist government.
   Many of the Solidarity deputies who cheered him were respected
politicians and scholars. But they knew they owed their political
provenance to the short, stout peasant's son who never went to
college.
   Still, Walesa manages to shoulder his awesome personal myth with
humor and dignity.
   ``I never thought I could be prime minister,'' he told the
lawmakers with a shake of his head the other night.
   They all shared a laugh. Of course he could be prime minister if
he wants. One day he may be president. The Polish people, it seems,
would elect him to any office in free elections.
   That trust in the man behind the moustache is the Polish
opposition movement's greatest asset. It is the reason Communist
politicians have been forced to cooperate with him. It is the lever
with which he is prying power away from them.
   A true Polish original, his political instincts and timing have
proved unerring as he has evolved from the charismatic worker leader
of 1980 to the national leader and international statesman of 1989.
   He now appears to have pulled off what could amount to a
bloodless revolution, extricating the government from Communist
control after 45 years.
   His impact has reached into other parts of the East bloc. If
Poland's government slips out of Communist control, can Hungary be
far behind? How easily do party leaders in neighboring
Czechoslovakia and East Germany rest knowing there's a Lech Walesa?
   Not that everybody in Poland is a Walesa fan. Some in his own
movement find him arrogant, accusing him of making decisions without
consulting his followers. Others fault him for being too apt to
compromise with a system they regard as illegitimate.
   This week, as his envoys were quietly coaxing longtime Communist
allies to form a Solidarity-led parliamentary majority, Walesa came
under fire from lawmakers who resented his secret dealings.
   Others in the chamber asked why in the bid for power Solidarity
should give over two key ministries to the Communists _ the ministry
of defense and the ministry of internal affairs, which controls the
police.
   Two of his oldest associates are in opposition to him, Andrzej
Gwiazda, a mentor for Walesa in opposition activity in Gdansk in the
late 1970s, and Anna Walentynowicz, the crane operator whose firing
in August 1980 prompted the shipyard strike that started Walesa's
astonishing climb to worldwide fame.
   But many of his longtime co-conspirators in the opposition have,
like Walesa, emerged this year as part of Poland's power structure
and now are the senators and deputies whose faces fill the screens
of state-controlled television most nights.
   As head of Solidarity, Walesa has an office and an official car _
a dented grey Polenez with a union banner afixed like an
ambassador's flag. Proceeds from his autobiography have paid for the
purchase of a spacious stucco house in Gdansk, where he lives with
his wife, Danuta, and their eight children.
   The house has a TV satellite dish in the backyard and a quiet
orchard and garden where Walesa tries to relax.
   Nevertheless, his ``Path of Hope,'' as Walesa titled his
autobiography last year, has not been smooth.
   He was born in 1943 to a poor farming family in the small village
of Popowo in north-central Poland. His father died from illness
caused by forced labor under the Nazis when Walesa was only 18
months old.
   After finishing technical school, where he was trained as an
electrician, he fixed farm machinery before drifting to Gdansk in
1967 and working at the Lenin Shipyard.
   In December 1970, when workers went on strike along the Baltic
coast to protest food price increases, security forces were called
in and killed scores of workers.
   Walesa, a rebel disgusted by poor safety conditions in the yard,
helped lead the strike there. The experience never left him and one
of his first acts when Solidarity was born was to see to the
erection of a monument on the square where the first victims died.
   In his autobiography, Walesa recalls how his entry into illegal
trade union activities in the late 1970s kept getting him fired from
various jobs and his fears that the resulting poverty and many
arrests were hurting his young family.
   A low point came in late 1979.
   ``We lived from day to day, scarcely managing to make ends meet.
... I was thus faced with a dilemma: whether to withdraw from
(activism) ... or whether to push on and become totally involved.''
   But he said he had already crossed the ``psychological barrier''
and could not give up what he had begun.
   The next August, he climbed the fence at the Lenin Shipyard _
where he had been fired in 1976 _ and took charge of the strike that
galvanized the country. Strikers won the right to free trade unions,
leading to the birth of Solidarity.
   But it was only the beginning of the roller coaster. Squeezed
between a hostile government and a militant membership, he was
constantly putting out fires.
   When martial law came Dec. 13, 1981, and he was imprisoned at a
series of government houses, Walesa said it meant ``a chance to rest
and sleep'' after the overwhelming tension of Solidarity's 500 days
of legal existance.
   When he was released in November 1982, there were rumors he made
a deal with authorities to get out. He was cautious in his
statements, saying he was on a ``greasy tightrope.''
   But slowly old associates rallied around him, he recalls in his
autobiography. In 1983, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
   Under the pressure of a declining economy and foreign sanctions,
Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski lifted martial law in 1983
and freed political prisoners in a series of amnesties that
culminated in 1986.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban kept up a propaganda campaign
against Walesa over the years, saying at the start of 1988 that
activists were ``weak, lost and out of touch with the masses.''
   But in May 1988, strikes broke out again and the workers' chief
demand was the legalization of Solidarity. A second wave of strikes
in August prompted the first government talks with Walesa since 1981.
   When the anniversary of that meeting rolls around in two weeks,
Solidarity well may be in control of the government.

<TEXT>
   A judge on Friday sentenced former South
Carolina Rep. John Jenrette to 30 days in jail and fined him $2,000
for stealing a necktie and shoes from a discount department store.
   Jenrette was also put on two years probation and ordered to do
200 hours of community service. In addition, he was told to continue
psychiatric and alcoholism treatment.
   Jenrette, 53, served 13 months in prison after he convicted in
1980 of bribery in the Abscam affair, a sting operation in which FBI
agents poising Arab shieks and businessmen offered bribes to
lawmakers. He is still on probation from that conviction.
   Jenrette's attorney, Steve Merril, said that his client would
have to appear before a hearing in federal court, where authorities
would then decide if he would have to serve a prison sentence for
violating his parole.
   Merril asked Fairfax County Circuit Court Judge Jack Stevens to
not take into account his client's previous record in handing down
the sentence.
   ``As the Commonwealth suggests, I'm going to treat you just like
any other shoplifter,'' Stevens said before the levying the
punishment.
   Jenrette was convicted on two counts of petty larceny for
switching price tags at a discount department store on Dec. 7. Two
security guards from the store testified during the trial that they
saw Jenrette steal the items.
   Before receiving his sentence, Jenrette told the judge, ``I
apologize to the court. I can only say that I'll never be back. Why
I let this happen, I don't know.
   ``I've totally wiped out all of my income and have lost all hopes
of getting my law license back.''
   The former lawmaker claimed the shoplifting incident was all a
mistake. He testified that he brought his own tie into the store to
compare it with the one he was thinking of buying.

   A federal drug agent who allegedly transported
cocaine from Miami to Boston for a price was in danger of losing his
home because of heavy debts, according to public records.
   Edward K. O'Brien, 44, a supervisory special agent with the Drug
Enforcement Administration, was arrested Monday at Logan
International Airport.
   O'Brien, who was making $59,540 a year, may have suffered under
the stress of debt and a divorce from his wife of 18 years, sources
told The Boston Globe.
   He had been ordered to pay $475 a week in child support and a
$9,000 home equity loan on a Springfield house as a part of a
divorce settlement last year.
   Court records indicate O'Brien defaulted on a loan of $80,000
from Robert H. Clark Jr. of Southwick, and a loan of $56,421 from
Robert Oulette of Freetown. Both loans were made last year.
   Clark initiated foreclosure proceedings in Land Court in Boston,
and Judge John E. Fenton Jr. issued the foreclosure order June 26,
public records showed.
   Oulette sued in New Bedford District Court, and a lien was placed
on O'Brien's home in Sandwich in April.
   O`Brien bought the home in March 1987 for $150,000. Barnstable
County Registry of Deeds records show O'Brien borrowed $30,000 from
Paul H. Dugan, who sold him the house.
   O'Brien owes $120,000 on a mortgage from the Plymouth Five Cents
Savings Bank on the house, the newspaper reported Friday.
   He has not been indicted or arraigned.

   The U.S. ambassador to Venezuela vetoed what he
described as an ``ill-planned ill-thought out'' plan by U.S. agents
to arrest the kingpin of the Colombian drug cartel, a State
Department spokesman said Friday.
   The aborted plan to arrest Jorge Ochoa last fall during a trip to
Caracas, Venezuela, was disclosed Thursday at a hearing of the
Senate Judiciary Committee on narcotics trafficking.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said at a briefing
Friday that ``the plan to capture Mr. Ochoa was not coordinated with
... the appropriate Washington agencies and the embassy in Caracas
and the Venezuelan government.''
   ``The Department insists, as do other law enforcement agencies,
on well-coordiated operations,'' Boucher said. ``There have been a
number of well-coordinated cases which have resulted in the
conviction of major traffickers, and these were the results of sound
planning and good coordination.
   ``Such coordination insures that we advance our anti-narcotics
objectives, without unecessary risks'' to government workers.
   The former U.S. Ambassador to Venezuela, Otto Reich, was quoted
by the Washington Post in its Friday editions as saying that
``everyone in the country was against'' the plan.
   ``It was an ill-planned, ill-thought out operation and the
government of Venezuela said no. ... It would have cost the lives
innocent Americans and Venezuelans,'' Reich said. Boucher confirmed
Reich's version.
   At the Senate hearing on Thursday, a former assistant U.S.
attorney in Miami, Richard Gregorie, said the Customs Service and
the Marshals Service developed a plan to arrest Ochoa in Caracas and
fly him to the United States for trial.
   Ochoa has been indicted by U.S. grand juries several times, but
the Colombian Supreme Court abrogated that country's extradition
treaty with the United States two years ago and he cannot be
arrested by his country's authorities on a U.S. warrant.

   One Rolling Stone says the ``Steel Wheels'' will
spin for only a year; his Glimmer Twin says he hopes the band will
stay together longer.
   Keith Richards and Mick Jagger, the quarrelsome frontmen for the
Rolling Stones _ the band _ revealed their disparate views to
Rolling Stone _ the magazine _ in an interview for its Sept. 7 issue.
   ``If you asked me what I wanted to do for the rest of my life,
Keith and I would probably disagree,'' said Jagger, lead vocalist
for the group. ``When it's good, it's really good. And when it isn't
good, it's boring. It's very hard to keep doing the same thing with
the same people over and over again.''
   Richards, predictably, disagreed.
   ``I can never think about starting something up again in order to
make it the last time,'' said the Stones guitarist. ``This is the
beginning of the second half.''
   Jagger said one of the reasons he decided to reunite with the
band for the ``Steel Wheels'' album and tour was that it would all
be done within a year. The tour begins Aug. 31 in Philadelphia.
   ``So we just have to put up with each other for a year,'' Jagger
said.
   Richards, who bad-mouthed Jagger in interviews and on his album
in the past year, said he knew the Stones would be able to work
together again after he and Jagger spent some time in Barbados.
   ``I did have to take Mick to a few discos _ which are not my
favorite places in the world _ because Mick likes to go out and
dance at night,'' Richards recalled. ``So I did that. That was my
sacrifice. I humored him. And that's when I knew we could work
together.''

   Woodstock veteran Richie Havens, the man who
made ``Freedom'' a hippie anthem, will offer his heady brand of folk
Saturday at the Organ Mountains Festival.
   Havens will perform at the all-day music festival to promote the
mountains as an environmentally protected area.
   The Organ Mountains Festival benefits the Bureau of Land
Management and the New Mexico Nature Conservancy, groups that work
to protect endangered plants and animals in the state.
   As the country celebrates the 20th anniversary of Woodstock this
month, Havens says the event is still being woefully misrepresented
by the media. The truth about the festival has nothing to do with
sex, drugs and music, Havens said; it has to do with numbers.
   ``So many people came that they had to write about us and our
ideas,'' Havens told the El Paso Times.
   He said he is convinced another wave of youthful rebellion will
rise: ``The kids today are Woodstock. They just don't know it yet.''

   Actor Brad Davis, nominated for an Academy
Award in 1978 for ``Midnight Express,'' is asking people to leave
their porch lights on during National POW Week to honor missing U.S.
prisoners of war.
   The gesture, coupled with using vehicle headlights in the daytime
the week of Sept. 11, is part of a campaign to get governmental
acknowledgment of war prisoners still unaccounted for, Davis said
Thursday.
   The campaign, ``Operation Bright Light: POWs ... Release In
Sight,'' will kick off with flag-raising ceremonies in Southern
California, said Joe Romo, a spokesman for a coalition of veteran's
groups.
   Romo said thousands of U.S. servicemen and women who fought in
wars dating back to World War II remain missing. ``They're our
brothers and sisters,'' he said. ``Why have they been abandoned?''

   Boxer Mike Tyson is trying to sell the
mountaintop mansion he once shared with actress Robin Givens for $8
million, an adviser for the heavyweight champ said.
   Tyson, who recently bought a house in Cleveland to be near his
promoter, Don King, moved to the small Somerset County borough in
March 1988, shortly after marrying Ms. Givens.
   They bought the five-bedroom, stone Victorian Gothic revival
mansion for $4.3 million and spent another $1.9 million acquiring
adjoining property, said Frank Petrozzo, a friend and financial
adviser to Tyson and resident of this borough 30 miles southwest of
Newark.
   Petrozzo said Tyson discussed selling the home after he and Ms.
Givens were divorced in June.
   Bernardsville Mayor Peter Palmer said that since Tyson's breakup
with Ms. Givens, he had not been spotted much in the area.
   ``The fact is, he's really already gone,'' Palmer said. ``Things
seemed to have been going quite well until whatever it was that
happened between him and Robin.''

<HEAD>Congressmen Say There's Confusion on Eastern Europe Withdrawal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. congressmen said Friday that a reorganization
of Soviet forces in Eastern Europe is making it difficult to assess
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's promised withdrawal of 50,000 soldiers.
   The members of the House Armed Services Committee, who were
ending an 11-day trip to the Soviet Union, praised their hosts for
granting them unprecedented access to military facilities that they
said will help build trust between the superpowers.
   But they said the trip had not clarified how the withdrawal from
Eastern Europe will affect the Soviet Union's fighting capability.
   ``We don't know what combat power is left in Eastern Europe after
the restructuring,'' said Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio.
   He said some units may be equipped with artillery for the first
time.
   ``We came here confused and we left confused,'' he said.
   Committee chairman Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., said that in the
process of withdrawing six divisions from its Eastern European
allies by the end of 1990, the Soviets are separating some regiments
and attaching them to divisions that will remain in Eastern Europe.
   Previously, U.S. officials assumed that entire divisions would be
withdrawn completely, he said. But Aspin added, ``We have no
evidence to indication those cuts aren't going to be made.''
   Aspin said the Soviet Union has no obligation to outline the
details of the unilateral withdrawal that Gorbachev announced at the
United Nations in December. But he urged the Soviets to make their
actions as clear as possible.
   ``The building of trust is what really counts,'' he added.
   The visit was one of a series of high-level contacts in an era of
better U.S.-Soviet relations.
   The congressmen said they hoped that members of the Supreme
Soviet's new committee on defense and state security would visit in
January or February.
   During their visit the congressmen also saw the Soviet space
shuttle assembly facility and its high-energy laser. Two of them
visited a chemical weapons decommissioning plant in Chebayevsk.
   They visited Soviet ground forces in East Germany and in the
Soviet Union, as well as U.S. military headquarters in West Berlin.
   Rep. Larry Hopkins, R-Ky., said he was impressed with the size
and advanced technology of the chemical plant. ``I was less
impressed with their candor and contingencies in case of an
accident,'' he said.
   He urged that the two countries reach an agreement that would
permit experts from the two sides to work together to dismantle
chemical weapons.

<TEXT>
   Federal investigators say mechanical failure
didn't cause the Cessna 177 crash that killed U.S. Rep. Larkin Smith
and his pilot.
   The comments of National Transportation Safety Board investigator
Jeff Kennedy came Thursday, as Gulf Coast residents mourned the
deaths of Smith and pilot Chuck Vierling in separate funerals.
   Smith, a 45-year-old freshman congressman from Mississippi's 5th
District, and Vierling, 58, died Sunday night when their
single-engine plane crashed into the DeSoto National Forest en route
to the Gulf Coast.
   Investigators with the NTSB have said Vierling apparently strayed
from his anticipated flight path on the 70-mile trip before clipping
a 70-foot pine tree.
   ``There was no structural failure of the airplane,'' said
Kennedy, who spent three days in Mississippi before returning
Thursday to his Miami office. ``Right now, we've ruled out any
in-flight breakup of the aircraft. He did not lose any of the
components of the airplane.
   The investigation now centers on weather and the pilot's actions,
Kennedy said.
   It could be four months before the NTSB rules on the cause of the
crash.
   The Armed Forces Institute of Pathology in Washington, D.C., is
examining tissue samples to determine if Vierling was physically
impaired during the flight.

<HEAD>Inflation Continues to Brake from Steep First-Half Acceleration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer prices rose just 0.2 percent in July,
continuing their slowdown from the steep acceleration experienced
earlier in the year, the Labor Department said Friday.
   While retail prices were up 5.9 percent for the year's first
half, the moderation actually began in June, when prices also rose
0.2 percent.
   Private analysts and the White House said the two-month softening
was a sign that the economy has moved beyond the worst inflationary
period.
   ``It's pretty clear that inflation's peaked out,'' said Lawrence
Chimerine, senior economic adviser at the WEFA Group in Bala Cynwyd,
Pa.
   ``We believe inflation is on a downward trend,'' said White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, with a vacationing George Bush in Maine.
``Economic indicators seem to be moving in the right direction and
the economy is growing steadily.''
   The Labor Department said the June and July figures both resulted
from drops in energy and clothing prices, combined with only small
gains in food costs. Rising energy and food prices had paced
consumer cost increases from January through May.
   Analysts and the Bush administration also took the summer's price
moderation as fresh evidence that the Federal Reserve Board is
succeeding in its attempts to guide the once-soaring economy to a
``soft-landing'' _ moderate growth with restrained inflation.
   ``The overall trend has been that the economy is, in fact,
achieving the soft landing everyone was hoping for.'' said Sandra
Shaber, an economist with the Futures Group, a Washington
forecasting firm. ``In other words, growth is continuing but
inflation is under control.''
   Easing inflation has been the goal of the Federal Reserve for
more than a year as it raised interest rates with the hope of
cooling the economy but not sending it into a recession.
   Whether the new moderation will now prompt the Fed to resume
nudging interest rates downward, as it began to do in June, was a
matter of dispute.
   Fitzwater said the report ``should take the pressure off interest
rates.''
   But Chimerine and William Dunkelberg, dean of the Temple
University School of Business in Philadelphia, said they do not
expect any major moves by the central bank in the immediate future.
   ``At this point, the Fed is going to sit tight and say there's no
scare on the inflation side. ... The economy is showing signs of
slowing, but there's really no need to make a dramatic move
either,'' Dunkelberg said.
   Chimerine and Shaber expect little further immediate improvement
in the inflation rate. Each expects inflation in the coming months
to be in the range of 4.5 percent to 5 percent, compared with the
4.4 percent rate for 1987 and 1988.
   Last month, energy prices fell 0.7 percent. Gasoline prices,
which had shot up 21.2 percent in the first five months of 1989,
fell 2.2 percent, thier steepest fall since October 1986.
   Other, less significant, energy prices rose. Fuel oil was up 1.5
percent, reversing June's 1.2 percent decline, while electricity and
natural gas costs rose 0.7 percent and 0.4 percent respectively.
   Clothing costs were off 0.8 percent, due in large part to
unusually high end-of-season price cuts for women's clothing, the
department said.
   At the same time, food and beverage prices edged up just 0.3
percent after rising a hefty 9.3 percent in the first five months of
1989 as the effects of last year's drought lingered.
   Prices for cereal products, beverages and sweets all rose
substantially, but were offset by a 0.7 percent decline in the costs
of meats, poultry, fish and eggs.
   Excluding the volatile food and energy areas, consumer prices
rose a moderate 0.4 percent.
   Tobacco costs rose 2 percent while new-car prices fell 0.4
percent.
   All the prices changes are seasonally adjusted, a process
designed to remove from the calculations influences that are
periodic and predictable.
   The various July changes, unadjusted, left the overall Consumer
Price Index at 124.4 percent of its 1982-84 base. That means a
hypothetical selection of goods costing $100 in the base period
would have cost $124.40 in July, 30 cents more than in June.
   In a separate report, the department said Americans' average
weekly earnings, after adjusting for inflation, rose 1.5 percent in
July after a 0.1 percent increase in June.
   The July rise stemmed from a 0.8 percent increase in average
hourly earnings and a 0.9 percent increase in average weekly hours,
which were partially offset by a 0.2 percent increase in prices as
measured by an index for urban wage earners.
   Average weekly earnings in July, before adjusting for inflation,
were $338.01, up 4.2 percent from a year earlier. Taking the 5.1
percent inflation rate for urban workers into account over the last
12 months, real weekly earnings were down 0.9 percent.

   Crazed drug kingpins, seductive women,
high-tech gadgets and harrowing escapes are all part of the latest
James Bond movie, ``Licence to Kill.''
   So is a Lark cigarette. And the placement and timing of a health
warning about the dangers of smoking has lawmakers fuming.
   Philip Morris paid $350,000 to the filmmaker, United Artists, to
have the cigarette appear in the film, according to congressional
testimony.
   In response to concerns from the American Lung Association,
American Heart Association and American Cancer Society, the movie
also contains the surgeon general's warning about the effect of
smoking. The warning comes during the final credits.
   But Reps. Tom Luken, D-Ohio, and Bob Whittaker, R-Kan., have
expressed reservations about the placement of the warning.
   ``We believe that the health warning should appear at the
beginning of the film, as many viewers of the film will leave before
they see a warning in the movie's credits,'' Luken and Whittaker
said in a letter to the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission.
   Luken said Friday he is sending the letter to Janet D. Steiger,
the FTC chairman, that also asks whether the commission has the
authority to issue rules on tobacco advertising in movies.
   In the letter, the lawmakers note that the FTC has issued no
rules on cigarette advertising in films.
   ``The federal government should take every possible step to
protect our children from the siren songs of the merchants of
addiction,'' Luken said in a statement.
   Luken, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on
transportation and hazardous materials, and Whittaker, the panel's
ranking Republican, are co-sponsors of a bill that prohibits all
tobacco ads and promotion that can be seen or heard by people under
the age of 18.
   The bill is titled, ``Protect Our Children From Cigarettes Act.''

<HEAD>Pope to Appeal to Youth in Spain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY BETH SHERIDAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II will urge the young to
spread Roman Catholicism when he addresses an unusual rally Saturday
in Spain that promises to resemble a huge Scout jamboree.
   The church has brought in 160 bishops, including Cardinal John
O'Connor of New York, and expects at least 300,000 youngsters at the
international rally, the highlight of John Paul's three-day visit to
Spain.
   Young people from 55 countries are traveling to Santiago de
Compostela for the church-sponsored fourth World Youth Day,
including groups from communist Cuba, Bulgaria and the Soviet
republic of Lithuania.
   Most are housed in tents, turning the city of 85,000 and its
environs into a giant campground.
   A flotilla of about 600 motorboats and fishing vessels sailed
into nearby La Coruna on Friday, recalling pilgrims who traveled by
sea to Santiago de Compostela in northwestern Spain.
   The purpose of all the activity is to capture the imagination of
young people and convince them to be standard-bearers in the
church's crusade for a more Christian, less secular world, Vatican
officials said.
   ``What this represents is a growing attention to youth and
working with youth as a pastoral priority of the Roman Catholic
Church,'' said Monsignor Peter Coughlan, undersecretary of the
Vatican's Pontifical Council for the Laity, which organized the
event.
   The pope's itinerary also includes visits Sunday evening and
Monday to the northern cities of Oviedo and Covadonga, which he did
not reach in his previous trips to Spain in 1982 and 1984.
   During those stops, the 69-year-old pontiff will say Masses
dedicated to the subjects of labor and devotion to Mary.
   While his message at Santiago is for world youth, the Oviedo and
Covadonga trips are aimed specifically to Catholics in Spain, whose
adherence has declined in the 11 years since church and state were
officially separated in the overwhelmingly Catholic country.
   In addition to the rally Saturday night on a mountain just
outside Santiago, Pope John Paul II will celebrate Youth Day with a
Sunday Mass.
   Coughlan said the pope's attention to youth was both personal and
strategic.
   John Paul has had a long-standing interest in young people
through his work as a university professor, bishop and cardinal. In
addition, Coughlan said, the pontiff realizes the young are
increasingly becoming the world's majority, especially in
underdeveloped countries.
   ``The future of the church in places like Zaire is caught up with
youth,'' he said in an interview.
   Santiago de Compostela was chosen for the rally to emphasize the
historical roots of Catholicism as the church approaches its third
milennium, Vatican officials say.
   The city became one of the three main pilgrimage sites of
Christianity, along with Jerusalem and Rome, after the bones of the
apostle St. James were said to have been discovered there in the 9th
century.
   Many youngsters participating in the rally walked part of the
traditional 500-mile Way of St. James that stretches from the
Pyrenees to Santiago.
   In a message for World Youth Day published in advance, John Paul
said Santiago's history reminds Catholics that they must spread
their faith.
   ``The world of today is a great land of mission, even in the
countries with an ancient Christian tradition,'' he said.
``Everywhere today, neopaganism and the process of secularization
constitute a great challenge to the evangelical message.''
   Among ``secular'' practices the church opposes are abortion,
artificial birth control and divorce.
   John Paul celebrated the first World Youth Day in Rome in 1986,
and the second in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The Vatican plans to hold
the event outside Rome every other year.
   This year's special day followed a week of church-sponsored
cultural and religious conferences in Santiago de Compostela that
brought Catholic youth leaders together.

   A hijacked helicopter swooped into the yard
of a medium-security state prison this morning and spirited two
inmates to freedom, officials said.
   Two women and a pilot were on board the copter when it set down
at the Arkansas Valley Correctional Facility in Crowley County at
about 9:15 a.m., authorities said.
   The helicopter _ and the bound and gagged pilot _ were found
later on the ground 35 miles north. The women and the escapees had
apparently transferred to a rented van.
   Walter Kautzky, director of the Colorado Department of
Corrections, said pilot Tim Graves told authorities the two women
rented the helicopter under the pretext of taking some photos of
some property east of Ordway. One of the women then pulled pulled a
gun on Graves when they got near the prison and forced him to land.
   The inmates were identified as Freddie Gonzales, 21, who was
serving a four-year sentence for robbery, and Ralph Brown, 21, who
was sentenced for sexual assault, theft and criminal impersonation.
   The prison is about 50 miles east of Pueblo in the plains of
southeastern Colorado. Roadblocks were set up on two highways in the
area.
   Liz McDonough, spokesman for the Colorado Department of
Corrections, said guards were unable to fire at the helicopter as it
came into the prison yard ``because the line of sight to the
helicopter was very awkward. There was not a clean line of sight.''
   The guards also feared for the safety of the pilot, she said.
   Kautzky said Graves was found tied up and gagged, but apparently
unhurt, in an old farmhouse near where the helicopter was found.
Kautzky had no further details on what he was able to tell
authorities about the incident.
   The helicopter was a jet-powered Bell 206A helicopter carrying
the letters N1442W, registered to Connelly Exploration, an
oil-exploration company in Denver, the Federal Aviation
Administration reported.
   The two women had contracted with a private pilot service,
Helicopter Airways, which is related to Connelly Exploration and
shares equipment with it. Graves is an employee of Helicopter
Airways.
   Taking part in the hunt for the escapees were personnel from the
Department of Corrections, the state patrol and the Colorado
National Guard. The Guard assigned helicopters to aid in the search.
   Authorities said Gonzales weighs 127 pounds and has black hair
and brown eyes. He was eligible for parole in September 1991. Brown,
weighing 170 pounds and with brown hair and green eyes, was eligible
for parole in October 1996.
   The incident was the latest in a rash of helicopter prison
escapes and escape attempts in recent years. The most recent in the
United States was April, when a helicopter crashed after its tail
rotor caught on a fence at the federal Metropolitan Correctional
Center in Miami, Fla. Both the pilot the would-be escapee survived
the crash.
   In July 1988, a woman hijacked a helicopter and forced the pilot
to land in the prison yard of the Penitentary of New Mexico near
Albuquerque. Three convicts escaped but were eventually captured.
   In November 1986, an inmate who had escaped a minimum-security
federal prison in Pleasanton, Calif., hijacked a helicopter and
returned to the prison to free a woman inmate who worked with him in
the prison business office. The couple were recaptured 10 days later
as they were buying wedding rings.

<HEAD>Boston Mayor Wants City Funds Out of Companies that Discriminate
in N. Ireland</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL BEEGAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Raymond L. Flynn said Friday he is working to
get city pension money and trust funds away from companies that do
business in Northern Ireland and fail to reduce job discrimination
against Catholics.
   ``We have to make sure the British government understands the
importance of fair employment practices and opening their economy to
all,'' said Flynn, who said he witnessed widespread job
discrimination against Roman Catholics when he visited Northern
Ireland last year.
   The unemployment rate is twice as high for Catholics as it is for
Protestants in British-ruled Northern Ireland. Catholics are a
minority there but a majority in the Irish Republic.
   Flynn filed a home rule petition Thursday calling for the
divestiture and signed an executive order requiring city contractors
owned by companies doing business in Northern Ireland to subscribe
to the MacBride Principles.
   The principles, named after the late Irish diplomat Sean
MacBride, winner of the 1974 Nobel Peace Prize, are aimed at
reducing job discrimination against Catholics. The guidelines
provide for equal access to jobs and promotion, the banning of
religious emblems from the workplace, public advertising of jobs and
for companies to monitor their affirmative action efforts.
   Francis Costello, Flynn's adviser on Irish affairs, said the
principles were modeled after the Sullivan Principles, which address
investment in South Africa.
   The home rule petition must be approved by the City Council and
the Legislature. The executive order, which affects contracts worth
several million dollars, does not need City Council approval.
   Costello said he expected the plan would win legislative approval
since Massachusetts, in 1984, became the first state in the nation
to pass a law embracing the McBride Principles. Ten other states and
a half-dozen cities have taken similar action.
   Costello said previous legislation has been largely symbolic and
that Flynn's proposals are enforceable. He said Flynn would campaign
for other mayors to take similar steps.
   Flynn said Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley was considering such a
proposal.
   The contractor order would not affect hiring practices of
contractors locally but would take their contracts away if their
owners don't follow the employment standards in Northern Ireland.
   Costello said the MacBride standards for Northern Ireland are no
more severe than the affirmative action requirements on minority
hiring in the United States.
   ``This is not an effort against American companies at all,''
Flynn said. ``Certainly we do not want to hurt job opportunities or
the economy of Northern Ireland.''
   But Alan White, deputy consul general for Great Britain in
Boston, said that is exactly what would happen.
   Pressure to abide by the principles has had ``a discouraging
effect on new American companies trying to establish themselves in
Northern Ireland,'' he said.
   ``If you follow the MacBride Principles, you have to sack
Protestants and hire Catholics,'' said White, which would only add
to the tense environment in Northern Ireland.
   White said Flynn should give a law passed earlier this year by
British Parliament a chance to work. The law outlaws job
discrimination in Northern Ireland, but does not require affirmative
action.
   Boston has about $11 million in pension funds invested in seven
of the 24 American companies doing business in Northern Ireland and
$2 million in trust funds invested in nine of the companies.
   More than half of the $11 million in pension money and nearly
one-fourth of the trust funds are invested in Digital Equipment
Corp. Other companies are NYNEX, Ford Motor Co., General Motors,
Exxon, Sunoco and Dunn &amp; Bradstreet.
   About 30 percent of Boston's 600,000 people are of Irish
extraction, said Bill O'Donnell, community relations manager for the
Boston Redevelopment Authority.

<HEAD>Woman Arrested On Charges of Using Drugs During Pregnancy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman whose newborn tested positive for
cocaine was being held on $20,000 bond Friday on charges she used
drugs during pregnancy.
   Marcelle D. Bruce, 25, was arrested Friday on felony charges of
criminal neglect. A warrant charges her with being ``a cocaine user,
causing her infant baby's health and life to be in danger.''
   She is the fourth woman in Greenville in less than a week to be
arrested on such charges.
   The infant was born last weekend at Greenville Memorial Hospital
and remains in the hospital, said police Detective D.L. Butler.
   Police will take the baby into protective custody next week, Ms.
Butler said. She said the infant could be placed in foster care by
the state.
   Of the babies born to the other three women arrested, one is in
the hospital and two are in foster care, officials said.
   A meeting is planned next week among police, state officials, the
solicitor's office and the hospital to work out a formal system for
handling these drug cases, Ms. Butler said.
   ``This is just the beginning,'' she said. ``You're going to see a
whole lot more of these in the future.''
   The hospital has supported the police, but some hospital
employees questioned the prosecution of mothers who come to the
hospital to deliver their children.
   A woman who gives birth to a drug-addicted baby should be treated
as a medical rather than criminal matter, said Rosemary Boling, head
nurse at Memorial's nursery.
   ``If the mother knew she would be criminally prosecuted, she
might avoid prenatal care. That would put an already at-risk (baby)
at even more risk,'' said Dr. Paul Catalana, an instructor in
Memorial's pediatric residency program.
   But county Assistant Solicitor Catherine Christophillis said the
arrests protest the babies and offer a chance to get the women into
treatment programs.
   ``It's not like I'm out here saying all these mothers should go
to jail,'' Ms. Christophillis said. ``My goal is to rehabilitate
them if they want to, to provide an opportunity for them and then
take a look and see if they want to do it.''

<HEAD>Special Prosecutor Cites Flaws in Ethics Act</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Ethics in Government Act is ``riddled with
exceptions and loopholes'' that let former executive branch
officials lobby with few restrictions, the prosecutor who won a
perjury conviction against Michael Deaver said Friday.
   Prosecuting Deaver on charges of lying about his lobbying of
former government colleagues ``was a useful contribution to the
public interest,'' independent counsel Whitney North Seymour said in
a final report on the case.
   But Seymour noted his inability to seek charges against the
former White House deputy chief of staff accusing him of violating
lobbying restrictions in the ethics law.
   Seymour said the lobbying provisions in effect at the time of the
Deaver case were ``riddled with exceptions and loopholes which made
it extremely difficult to enforce except for the most flagrant
violations.''
   The prosecutor said there was an absence of sufficient readily
available, credible evidence and there were legal questions about
the scope of the ethics law.
   Deaver's lawyers said in their own report that Seymour's
conclusions ``ring hollow.'' They said the investigation and
prosecution of Deaver ``raise concerns about the potential for
abuse'' of the ethics law under which Seymour was appointed to
launch his criminal probe.
   For purposes of the post-employment lobbying restrictions of the
ethics law, the White House at the time of the Deaver case was
divided into nine separate agencies, a situation known as
compartmentalization.
   The law prohibits former employees from lobbying the agency or
department where they worked. But because of compartmentalization,
Deaver had ``a blanket exemption for contacts with most of the key
White House officials he had worked with regularly,'' said Seymour.
   The Bush administration has since decided to treat the various
White House components as one agency for purposes of the ethics law.
Legislation to ban compartmentalization is pending.
   Nonetheless, ``even where a former official employs his own
former staff aides for his lobbying business and uses them to carry
personal messages to his former agency,'' such activity is
permitted, said Seymour.
   Deaver's lawyers said Seymour's comments contradict his earlier
statements in court that Deaver had committed perjury in order to
conceal his violations of the ethics law.
   ``We now know that Mr. Seymour knew that that was not true at the
very time that he was telling the court that it was,'' said Deaver's
lawyers.
   In response, the prosecutor issued a six-page statement saying
that ``Deaver distorts Independent Counsel's explanation for not
prosecuting him'' for violations of the ethics law. Seymour said he
never concluded that Deaver didn't violate the ethics law.
   Deaver was convicted of lying when he denied to Congress that he
had facilitated a meeting between the Korean trade representative
and President Reagan. He also was convicted for lying to a grand
jury by denying that he made government contacts on behalf of TWA
and denying he contacted government officials for the Commonwealth
of Puerto Rico.
   Seymour's conclusions and Deaver's response were released by a
special panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals.
   Reagan's onetime deputy chief of staff was fined $100,000 and
ordered to perform 1,500 hours of community service for his three
felony convictions in 1987 of lying under oath to a House
subcommittee and grand jury that questioned him about his lobbying
of former Reagan administration colleagues.
   Citing a $1 million legal bill, Deaver is seeking to reduce to
$25,000 the $100,000 fine.
   Deaver has begun counseling alcoholics at a downtown shelter for
the homeless.

   A truck hauling 40,000 rounds of
military aircraft ammunition caught fire on an interstate highway
early today, killing a woman and seriously injuring her companion,
authorities said.
   Hours after the fire broke out, the northbound lanes of the
interstate were still closed as shells continued to explode. But the
accident happened in a remote area and no one had to be evacuated,
officials said.
   ``It was like fireworks,'' Rock Springs Fire Chief Pete Davis. He
said ammunition and shell casings were scattered 100 yards around
the truck and explosions kept everyone at a distance for hours.
   Sgt. Allan Schmidt, spokesman for the Arizona Department of
Public Safety, said the couple aboard the truck were believed to be
husband and wife. ``Somehow, the gentleman was either thrown free or
got out,'' he said. The woman was found dead.
   The man was in serious but stable condition in John C. Lincoln
Hospital in Phoenix at midday, hospital spokesperson Lisa Boulay
said. The couple's names were not immediately released.
   The truck-trailer rig, under contract to the military, was on
Interstate 17 en route to the Navajo Army Depot near Flagstaff when
a fire apparenty engulfed it about 1 a.m., Schmidt said.
   It was hauling 20 millimeter aircraft cannon ammunition.
   Smoke was still coming from the truck and ammunition was still
exploding sporadically five hours later, said Schmidt.
   The accident occurred in a rural, sparsely populated area about
30 miles north of Phoenix. Schmidt said there were no evacuations.
   I-17 was completely closed for three hours, but the southbound
lanes were later reopened and were accommodating traffic in both
directions. They are separated from the northbound lanes by several
hundred feet.
   ``No one is going near this vehicle,'' said Schmidt. ``There are
still occasionally explosions, as rounds go off. We do not really
know how far ammunition has been thrown from the vehicle, but it has
been thrown.''
   Two teams of ordnance experts from Luke Air Force Base, near
Phoenix, and the Army's Fort Huchuca in Sierra Vista, in southern
Arizona, were dispatched to the scene.
   Lt. Col. Ed Cooke of Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio
confirmed the truck carried 40,000 rounds of Class D ammunition,
weighing 37,000 pounds. Cooke said said the ammunition had been
stored in Arizona but came originally from a Kelly-run storage
facility located at Lackland Air Force Base, also in San Antonio.
   Schmidt said authorities either got erroneous information from
the military or misunderstood it when they initially reported the
truck carried 800,000 rounds of ammunition.

   An F-4 Phantom jet smashed into a
concrete barrier at 480 mph in a test to learn how to protect a
nuclear reactor from a plane crash.
   The surplus plane, strapped to rails and propelled by rockets,
slammed into a million-pound barrier at Sandia National Laboratories
on April 18, 1988. Details of the test were reported Thursday during
the 10th International Conference on Structural Mechanics in Reactor
Technology at Anaheim, Calif.
   ``The crash data are going to give us an unprecedented ability to
predict the impact force when an aircraft crashes into a building,''
said Walter A. von Riesemann, supervisor of Sandia's containment
technology division.
   ``We'd previously done some fairly accurate computer analysis,
but the computer models were untried on the real thing. Not
anymore.''
   Researchers need to estimate the structural response of a
building in such an accident. To do that they must know how the
impact force changes throughout the brief time the crash is in
progress, Sandia officials said.
   The F-4 jet weighed 42,000 pounds at impact, which included more
than 1,200 gallons of water to simulate the weight of fuel and
provide proper mass distribution, Sandia officials said.
   Sixteen high-speed framing cameras recorded the crash, shooting
from 500 to 2,000 frames per second.
   The concrete block, supported by air bags that enabled it to be
moved with just 2,000 pounds of force, suffered minor damage, with
the engines penetrating no more than 2.4 inches.
   The target was able to move, acting much like a bathroom scale,
with the force of impact determined by measuring how much the block
moved.
   The test was funded by the Muto Institute of Structural Mechanics
Inc. of Tokyo.

<HEAD>US Cutting Military Training, Presence To Protest Abuses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States is reducing its military
training and presence in Somalia to protest ``gruesome'' human
rights abuses by security forces in the strategically placed east
African nation, U.S. officials said Friday.
   The decision comes as the administration seeks to renegotiate an
agreement for use of the Red Sea port of Berbera by U.S. Navy
vessels moving to and from the Indian Ocean. The pact expires next
year.
   Although U.S. military assistance to Somalia in the past two
years has dwindled sharply, the decision to cut it further indicates
U.S. frustration with the government's inability to reign in the
security forces and control a growing mutiny throughout the country,
the officials said.
   ``As a token of our frustration with the security forces, we
decided to reduce our military activities,'' said one official.
``The government of Somalia knows it's no longer business as usual.''
   Officials are still examining what programs to cut, ``but we'll
be looking at training areas,'' and that will mean pulling out some
U.S. military advisers, the official said.
   Somalia, which had shifted its alliance from the Soviet Union to
the West in 1977, flirted with Libya last year and received some
military supplies. But with the U.S. decision to suspend weapons
deliveries, Somalia has been buying arms on the open market to use
against some rebels.
   ``There's general, communal strife throughout Somalia,'' said one
official. ``Gvernment control outside Mogadishu is slipping,'' he
added, speaking only on condition of anonymity.
   In the northern part of the impoverished country of 6 million,
the Somali National Front has gained ground against government
troops, while in the south, Ogadeni tribesmen are conducting a
hit-and-run guerrilla campaign.
   Reliable information is hard to come by because journalists have
been prevented from visiting the country and dissidents are afraid
to speak out.
   But the State Department says there are credible reports that
last month, security forces summarily executed dozens of Somalis on
the beach near Mogadishu following clashes between Moslems and
government troops that left 400 people dead.
   ``The events are tragic, gruesome,'' said the official. ``I hope
the government can find their way out of it, but they seem to have
lost their way.''
   The United States had been encouraged earlier this year when
President Siad Barre, under strong congressional pressure from
Washington, freed 200 to 300 political prisoners. Barre, an
autocratic ruler who has run the one-party state since 1969, also
agreed to speak to some opposition figures.
   To encourage further progress, the administration asked Congress
for $21 million to help Somalia pay its arrears to the International
Monetary Fund, said the official.
   But with the rioting in mid-July and the mass executions,
Congress turned down the request, he said.
   ``We decided not to fight it. We can't make a credible argument
to Congress. We can't show anything positive,'' he said.
   The administration has sought to stave off congressional
criticism of Somalia's human rights violations in recent years
through backstage pressure on Barre to improve his record.
   Congress last year froze nearly $40 million in food and
development aid for Somalia, and the administration decided to
suspend all lethal weapons supplies after U.S. rifles and ammunition
were used against rebels and civilians in the north.
   Most of the U.S. aid since then has been of non-lethal military
equipment, as well as training of Somali personnel.
   The Somali National Front, which is the largest anti-government
force, has been fighting Barre's forces for seven years. At least
one senior government commander reportedly deserted in recent weeks.
   But most of the country's six major tribes appear to be warring
against the government or each other, said the U.S. official.
``Events are running beyond anyone's control. It strains one's
credulity to think someone is masterminding it. But responsibility
for controling the situation lies with the government forces,'' he
said.

   Band leader Xavier Cugat was released
from a hospital Friday, a month after he was admitted for a heart
ailment, a hospital spokeswoman said.
   Cugat, 89, has recovered fully from a problem in his left
ventricle that kept him in the Quiron Clinic's intensive care unit
for two weeks following his admission July 20, said the spokeswoman,
Isabel Mas.
   She said he was ``in perfect shape.''
   Cugat, who is generally credited with introducing tropical
rhythms into American dance music, has suffered four heart attacks
and a stroke since 1980.
   The band leader became a U.S. star in the 1930s, playing Latin
dance music at the Coconut Grove club in Los Angeles' Ambassador
Hotel and later at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York. He also appeared
in several Hollywood movies.
   Cugat was born Jan. 1, 1900, in the northeastern Catalonian town
of Gerona, but moved with his family to Cuba as a child.
   In 1970, he turned over his band to Tito Puente, and a decade
later returned to Barcelona, where he has lived in the Hotel Ritz
for several years.

<HEAD>Party Leaders Spurn Appeals to Reassess Soviet-Led Invasion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party leadership
Friday refused to reassess the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion that
abruptly halted the nation's move toward a freer society.
   The 21st anniversary of the Soviet-led invasion is Monday. The
occasion has brought many appeals, including from Warsaw Pact
neighbors, to rewrite the emotional chapter in Czechoslovak history.
   The party leadership, however, refused to alter the official view
that the invasion was a good thing.
   ``There are various attempts at home and abroad at would-be
reassessment of the events of the time,'' said a Communist Party
Presidium statement carried by the official CTK news agency.
   ``The period of social crisis in 1968-69 and events connected
with this period have been thoroughly assessed and evaluated, using
all accessible documents by the 14th Congress of the Communist Party
in 1971,'' the statement said.
   That congress condemned the ``Prague Spring'' reforms and gave
formal approval to the armed intervention.
   The anniversary of the invasion has highlighted the divisions in
the East bloc, where some nations are experimenting with more open
economies and cultures and others are adhering to strict socialism.
   The lower house of the Polish National Assembly on Thursday
adopted a resolution asserting that the invasion ``violated every
nation's ... natural desire for democracy, freedom and respect of
human rights.'' The upper house criticized the invasion last week.
   Hungarian Communists issued a statement Tuesday saying they
disagreed with the invasion and urged the Prague leadership to
reassess the events.
   But the invasion has been defended by East Germany, which has
rejected the sort of democratic reforms undertaken by Poland and
Hungary. East Germany and Czechoslovakia are among the most
hard-line Soviet bloc countries.
   The intervention ``proved to be the only effective way out,'' New
Germany, the East German Communist Party daily, said Friday.
   CTK said the Presidium agreed that the Hungarian statement
``objectively helps forces which act against socialism in
Czechoslovakia.''
   The Czechoslovak government again served notice Thursday that it
would crack down on all public demonstrations attempting to
commemorate the anniversary.
   Czechoslovak human rights groups and prominent activists have
asked there be no street protests, citing fears of a harsh response
by the authorities.
   The 1968 invasion crushed the short-lived liberalization period
spearheaded by then-Communist Party leader Alexander Dubcek.
   Except for Romania, the invasion included all of Czechoslovakia's
Warsaw Pact allies: the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, East Germany,
Hungary and Poland.

<TEXT>
   Three paintings valued at $2.3 million,
including two works by the Spanish master Diego de Velazquez, are
missing from their places in the Royal Palace, an official said
Friday.
   The paintings were reported missing from a restricted area in the
national museum by members of a restoration crew, said the palace
official, who asked not to be identified. He said they were last
seen a week ago.
   ``Robbery is certainly one of many possibilites, but we're by no
means certain that the paintings were stolen,'' the palace spokesman
said.
   The two Velazquez paintings are valued at $820,000 each, the
official said. One painting portrays a cleric holding up a piece of
paper bearing the artist's signature. The second depicts a woman's
head.
   The third painting, by Carreno de Miranda and valued at $615,000,
portrays the bust a woman from the era of Charles II.
   An article printed six months ago in the Spanish news daily
Diario 16 raised concerns over inadequate security at the palace, a
popular tourist attraction, after several youths showed reporters
how they could get in undetected.

<TEXT>
   The State Department on Friday again criticized
Syria's allies in Lebanon for shelling Christian enclaves in the
war-torn country and urged them to observe a cease-fire on all
fronts.
   Spokesman Richard Boucher said recent reports indicated Syrian
troops were not actively engaged in the fighting. But he stressed
the reports dealt with a 12-hour period and it was too early to say
whether Syria had heeded a U.S. call to lay down its arms.
   ``The most urgent thing, the most important thing, is for people
to accept a cease-fire,'' Boucher said.
   Deferring again to the Arab League to try to stop the fighting,
Boucher said, ``We would welcome a resumption of their efforts.''
   He said that Amal and Druze militias were continuing their drive
against Christian enclaves and that the Christians were retaliating.
   ``We feel there is no justification for continued military action
in the face of urgent appeals and we urge all sides to implement and
immediately observe a cease-fire on all fronts,'' Boucher said.
   On Monday, the State Department sharply condemned Syria and its
allies for the eruption of large-scale ground fighting in Lebanon
and said the turmoil in the Middle Eastern country made U.S. efforts
to gain the release of American hostages more difficult.
   ``Syria-supported forces have joined the latest round of fighting
in Lebanon,'' Boucher said Friday. ``This represents an
irresponsible escalation of the violence. Syria and its allies
should refrain from any further escalation and accept immediately
international and Arab League calls for a cease-fire and a lifting
of the blockade'' of Christian ports.
   At the same time, Boucher urged the Christians to observe a
cease-fire and to join in the ``political reconstruction'' of
Lebanon. This means, in effect, agreeing to new power-sharing
arrangements with Muslims that would reduce Maronite influence in
the country.

   Also Friday, police arrested a leader of the anti-apartheid
movement's national defiance campaign and banned a weekend rally
that was planned as part of the 3-week-old campaign.
   A court sentenced Trevor Tutu, son of Archbishop Desmond Tutu, to
18 months in prison for making a false bomb threat at Johannesburg's
international airport.
   The clash outside a pie company began after about 400 workers
gathered at its gate to protest being locked out. Louis Silber,
managing director of Mama's Pies, said the lockout was imposed
because of a 4-week-old wage dispute.
   The Food and Allied Workers Union said police used whips and live
ammunition to disperse the workers and made several arrests.
   Capt. Reg Crewe, a spokesman at police headquarters in Pretoria,
said police acted only after workers began pulling on the locked
gates and ingored an order to disperse. He said officers initially
used whips but fired shotguns when some fleeing workers threw stones.
   He said four people were slightly injured by shotgun fire. He
said no one was arrested.
   It was the second violent labor clash in two days. On Thursday,
police said at least 10 people were injured outside the
British-owned Eveready plant in Port Elizabeth in clashes between
striking workers and people recruited to fill their jobs.
   Mohammed Valli Moosa, an official of the banned United Democratic
Front and an organizer of a 3-week-old defiance campaign, was
arrested at his Johannesburg office.
   A police officer said he was held under emergency regulations
allowing detention of anyone deemed a threat to public safety.
   Valli Moosa has been one of the highest-ranking activists not
under any restrictions. He was one of three activists who escaped
detention last year and took sanctuary at the U.S. Consulate in
Johannesburg.
   One of the other escapees, Murphy Morobe, said Valli Moosa's
arrest violated the government's promise that the three could leave
the consulate without fear of being detained again or placed under
restrictions.
   The United Democratic Front, a nationwide coalition, and 16 other
anti-apartheid groups last year were ordered to halt all activities.
   They intended to defy the order and declared themselves legal at
a rally Sunday, the group's sixth anniversary.
   Police officials banned the rally but did not say if all defiance
rallies planned Sunday would be banned.
   The rallies were organized as part of a nationwide defiance
campaign that began Aug. 3, when blacks sought treatment at
segregated white hospitals. Since then, dozens of activists have
defied restrictions imposed on them.
   Archbishop Tutu described the ban as ``inflammatory'' and called
for an alternative ``service of witness'' at his church in Cape Town.
   The younger Tutu was convicted of violating the Aviation Act by
falsely telling police there was a bomb in his luggage. He pleaded
innocent and said he would appeal.
   He also was convicted on five other charges stemming from two
other incidents.
   In addition to the 18-month sentence, Tuto was fined $440.
   Shortly after the Dec. 31 bomb incident at Jan Smuts Airport,
Tutu convened a news conference and told reporters he deliberately
courted arrest as part of a publicity stunt on behalf of his
advertising agency.
   The other charges include three counts of slandering police and
traffic officers, one count of interfering with police last year
when they tried to arrest a friend of his on suspicion of drunken
driving, and one count of maliciously damaging a police officer's
hat.

   Two men armed with assault rifles shot an armored
car guard to death and wounded another in a botched holdup at a
shopping center Friday, authorities said.
   The guards had just finished making a delivery to the Long Island
Savings Bank in an exclusive section of the borough of Queens when
they were confronted at 11:20 a.m., said Detective Joseph McConville.
   The guards exchanged gunfire with the two men, and at least a
dozen shots were fired, McConville said. One guard was shot in the
head and the other was hit in the chest, arm and groin, McConville
said.
   The 26-year-old guard who was shot in the head was pronounced
dead at 12:15 p.m. at Booth Memorial Hospital, police said. The
other guard was in critical condition at the hospital.
   The gunmen fled in a car. No money was taken.
   The guards' names were not released pending notification of their
families.
   A third security guard who was inside the armored van when the
shooting broke out was not wounded.
   The bullet-marked car was recovered a short time later in a
wooded area near a city highway. Investigators found three guns near
the vehicle, but believed the gunmen were still aarmed.
   Police helicopters and bloodhounds searched a park and an
apartment complex near the highway.

   Solidarity editor Tadeusz Mazowiecki
declared Friday that he is ready to accept President Wojciech
Jaruzelski's offer to nominate him as prime minister and break the
Communist grip on power in Poland.
   Mazowiecki, a veteran opposition activist who spent a year in
jail during Jaruzelski's martial law crackdown of 1981, confirmed he
is the president's choice to lead the next government.
   ``Our Premier!'' the opposition newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza
proclaimed triumphantly, if somewhat prematurely, in a headline
above Mazowiecki's smiling picture Friday.
   The formal announcement was planned for Saturday, the state
official said. But already the offical PAP news agency was treating
Mazowiecki, editor of the Solidarity union weekly Tygodnik
Solidarnosc, as a major public figure. It reported throughout the
day his meetings with dignitaries.
   The appointment of a Solidarity-led government, the first
non-Communist government in the Soviet bloc since Soviet dictator
Josef Stalin consolidated control of Eastern Europe in the late
1940s, would be an event of historic significance.
   Local Communist Party chapters expressed dismay Friday, PAP
reported. ``We are firmly against forming a government as proposed
by the opposition,'' said a statement issued by the Wroclaw party.
   ``We appeal to the Central Committee for a defense of socialist
values,'' said the Walbrzych chapter, according to PAP.
   Mazowiecki met Friday with party chief Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski,
who has called a meeting of his Central Committee for Saturday to
discuss the government changes. Mazowiecki also met with Roman
Catholic primate Cardinal Jozef Glemp.
   After meeting with Jaruzelski, Mazowiecki confirmed he expected
to be offered the post and would accept despite the ``huge
problems'' he sees ahead.
   ``It won't be easy,'' he said, referring to Poland's crippled
economy, $39 billion foreign debt, food shortages and widespread
public discontent.
   ``I think the most difficult task will be to make people think
that it can be better _ even though it cannot be better immediately
_ and make them believe that their work is not wasted,'' he said at
the National Assembly building.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, who deftly assembled the coalition
of lawmakers that has apparently engineered a transfer of the
government away from the Communist Party, proposed Mazowiecki to
Jaruzelski at a meeting Thursday.
   Mazowiecki was one of three candidates offered by Walesa and his
coalition partners, the United Peasant and Democratic parties, and
according to Solidarity sources he was Walesa's first choice.
   In addition to being the first non-Communist premier, Mazowiecki
would be the first practicing Catholic to head the government in
this highly religious country since the war.
   ``I am afraid of many things,'' Mazowiecki said. ``But if I were
only afraid, I would be a total pessimist. Somebody has to try it. I
am a believer and I believe providence cares for us.''
   He said the talk with Jaruzelski was ``very fundamental,
concerning all important topics.''
   Mindful of the Soviet Union's strategic concerns, Solidarity has
said it will grant the Communists the ministries of defense and
interior, which oversee the army and police.
   The Soviet government daily Izvestia on Friday said it is clear
Poland is headed for its first ``non-Communist'' government in
decades.
   Perhaps to reassure Soviets there would be some continuity,
Izvestia also ran excerpts from an interview Walesa gave to West
German TV in which he said Poland would remain in the Soviet-led
Warsaw Pact military alliance.
   While Moscow in recent days has expressed concern over the
developments, Soviet foreign ministry officials have said that
formation of the government is an internal Polish affair.
   President Bush at this point is not considering expanding the
$119 million economic aid package he has announced for Poland, said
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater. Fitzwater said Bush
would have no comment on the selection of a new prime minister until
the parliamentary process.
   Even with a non-Communist coalition in charge of the government,
the Communist Party will continue to wield great influence.
   Jaruzelski oversees military and foreign policy as president, and
party members are scattered throughout the government and courts.
   Jaruzelski must nominate the prime minister for approval by the
Sejm, the lower house of the National Assembly. Approval would seem
assured because the Solidarity-led coalition forms a 264-member
majority in the 460-member chamber.
   Mazowiecki would be given a period of several weeks to assemble a
Cabinet and present it to the Sejm for a vote.
   Jaruzelski accepted the concept of a Solidarity-led government
during a historic meeting with Walesa on Thursday. Walesa also
offered two alternative candidates to Mazowiecki: Solidarity
parliamentary leader Bronislaw Geremek and longtime activist Jacek
Kuron.
   Mazowiecki, 62, was the least publicly known of the three, but
his ties to Solidarity date to the August 1980 strikes in Gdansk
that gave birth to the movement.
   A Catholic journalist trained as a lawyer, he was jailed for one
year after the 1981 martial-law crackdown for his opposition to the
government. Mazowiecki also was at Walesa's side when nationwide
strikes last year served as the catalyst for the government's
decision to open talks with the union, legalize it and allow
opposition participation in elections.
   Those elections resulted in Solidarity's victory in virtually
every race its candidates entered.
   Before the union's rise, Mazowiecki was active in independent
Catholic circles. Mazowiecki was part of the ZNAK group that managed
under church protection to serve as a focal point for thinking
independent of Communist ideology in Poland in the 1960s and 1970s.
The group was allowed a token number of seats in parliament and
Mazowiecki held one from 1961 to 1971.
   He was the editor of a Catholic monthly from 1958 until 1981 when
he founded Tygodnik Solidarnosc. It was banned under martial law but
resurrected by Mazowiecki this year after Solidarity was legalized.
   By rejecting the office of prime minister this week, Walesa
remains free to head the union. There is fear in the opposition that
the coalition government might fail to satisfy social aspirations in
the face of the country's crushing economic problems and have to
resign. Union advisers argued Walesa should not risk his personal
reputation.

   Amish have a constitutional right to
refuse to affix safety emblems to their horse-drawn buggies, a
unanimous Minnesota Supreme Court ruled Friday.
   The decision dismissed traffic citations issued in 1988 against
14 Amish who had refused to display orange-red slow-moving vehicle
signs or an alternate black triangular emblem on their black buggies.
   ``It's a precedent-setting First Amendment case,'' said attorney
Phillip Villaume, who represented the Amish. ``Our Supreme Court is
the highest court in the country to address this specific issue.
It's just a major victory for individuals, and for the Amish
specifically.''
   Assistant Fillmore County Attorney Matthew Opat, who argued in
support of the law, said the ruling jeopardizes highway users _ even
though there have been no accidents involving Amish buggies.
   ``It doesn't seem reasonable to have to have people killed and
maimed before there is a public safety issue,'' Opat said. He was
unsure whether the county would appeal.
   The 14 members of the Old Order Amish religion had drawn petty
misdemeanor charges for their refusal to use the emblems.
   ``These appellants ... are unwilling to compromise their belief
that the `loud' colors required and the `worldly symbols' the
triangular shape represents to them conflicts with the admonitions
found in Apostle Paul's Epistles,'' wrote Associate Justice Glenn
Kelley.
   ``To them to do so would be putting their faith in `worldly
symbols' rather than in God.''
   Fillmore County, just north of the Iowa border in southeastern
Minnesota, has about 1,000 Amish residents, who adhere to 19th
century customs and generally do not use cars or other modern
conveniences.
   There are about 90,000 Amish in 22 states, with the largest
population in Ohio, which has about 31,000 Amish, followed by
Pennsylvania's 27,000 and Indiana's 22,000.
   Fillmore County District Judge Clement H. Snyder refused in
December to dismiss the charges, but also asked that a higher state
court review the matter.
   The Supreme Court held that the trial court improperly determined
that to be ``sincere'' a belief must be shared by a religious
community as a whole.
   ``The fact that at least one of the appellants has already
actually suffered jail incarceration, and that the others have
persistently expressed a willingness to do so rather than comply
with the statute, must assuredly buttress that implicit finding that
the appellants individually possessed a personal sincerity of
belief,'' Kelley said.
   Two Amish men were jailed on contempt of court charges filed
after they refused to perform community work or pay a fine for their
failure to use warning emblems, Opat said.
   The Supreme Court said the state has a legitimate interest in
protecting the public on its highways. But it said even the
black-triangle option was burdensome to Amish beliefs.
   During the daytime, the alternate emblem does not provide any
more warning of the presence of a slow-moving vehicle than does the
black square horse-drawn buggy itself, the court said.
   At night and in bad weather, the Amish have said they do not
object to outlining the boxes of their buggies with silver
reflective tape or to displaying red, lit lanterns to supplement the
tapes, the court said.
   ``Obviously, the Amish are very concerned about the men, women
and children riding in those buggies,'' Villaume said. ``They're
cautious, and aren't likely to compromise their safety. When you put
a buggy up against a vehicle, the buggy obviously is vulnerable.''
   Under the court's ruling, Amish don't have to use any warning
insignia on their slow-moving vehicles, Villaume said. However, he
said he will advise them to use the tape and lanterns cited by the
court.

   Police roused scores of homeless people from
their cardboard boxes and piles of blankets early Friday to drive
them from the streets around Manhattan's Port Authority bus station.
   ``Why do they want to push all the people out?'' Ida Rodriguez
asked as she neatly folded the sheet that served as her mattress.
Then she picked up her dirty purple teddy bear, shoved her bandaged
foot into a laceless sneaker and limped away as police approached at
about 2 a.m.
   The six Port Authority Police officers who moved about 100
homeless people out were said to be opposed to the operation, but
acting under orders. ``It's like throwing sand in the ocean,'' one
sergeant said.
   The officers were followed by 10 men with brooms and garbage bins
to collect the meager possessions left behind.
   The first vagrants to be evicted had about five minutes to pack
up the blankets they had draped from scaffolding on the side of the
building before the garbage detail dismantled the makeshift curtains
for them.
   People living nearby saw the police coming and had more time to
pack.
   An elderly woman stacked her blankets and belongings into a
teetering shopping cart. ``I'm OK,'' she said over and over again.
Then she said: ``They're not going to throw this in the garbage.
It's against the law.''
   A 16-year-old girl was taken to nearby Covenant House, which
helps those under age 21.
   The area in and around the bus station has a large homeless
population, ranging from the needy who have nowhere else to go to a
younger, tougher crowd involved in drugs and prostitution.
   During Friday morning's operation 16 men agreed to go in a van to
a shelter on Ward's Island run by the Volunteers of America.
   Others crammed what they could into milk crates and took off for
nearby streets, saying they would be back in a day or two. No one
was arrested.
   ``People can't sleep in a shelter,'' Johnny Rodriguez said as he
roused a grizzled friend sleeping nearby, put the man's arm over his
shoulder and led him hobbling away.
   Another man refused to leave his pile of cardboard, saying he was
scheduled for a foot operation the next day and was to be picked up
at the bus terminal.
   Police appeared skeptical until he produced his hospital
appointment papers from a paper bag. Inspector James Romito, who
directed the operation, finally persuaded him to leave in an
Emergency Medical Services ambulance.
   ``I don't think we're overstepping our bounds. I don't think
we're doing anything inhumane,'' Romito said. ``This is part of our
job. What the police are supposed to do is maintain order.''

   Syrian gunners fired 120 rockets Friday at
the only passenger vessel that serves the Christian enclave,
wounding seven people on the pier and forcing the ship to flee for
Cyprus, police said.
   It left behind hundreds trying to escape the artillery war that
has killed 779 people and wounded 2,109, by police count, in five
months.
   The sea route to Cyprus is the only link to the outside for the 1
million Christians of the 310-square-mile enclave, which is sealed
on the other three sides by Syrian soldiers, guns and tanks.
   At the northern end of the Christian enclave, Syrian and
Christian soldiers fought a four-hour battle across the Madfoun
River bridge that police described as the heaviest since the U.N.
Security passed a cease-fire resolution Tuesday.
   They said the Syrians fired at merchant ships sailing into the
Christian port of Amsheet, just south of the river, Friday afternoon
and Christian gunners fired on Syrian positions, touching off the
exchange.
   Christian radio stations said nine Syrian soldiers were killed
and 12 wounded in the clash 28 miles north of Beirut, and gave
Christian casualties as four wounded. Police said they could not
confirm the report.
   Syrian gunners regularly bombard the Christian-held coast north
of Beirut to disrupt the flow of arms and other supplies to the
Christians.
   Police said three people were killed and 26 wounded in sporadic
artillery exchanges elsewhere.
   In Baghdad, President Saddam Hussein, King Hussein of Jordan and
Yasser Arafat, head of the Palestine Liberation Organization, met on
Friday and agreed to ask the Arab League for an emergency summit on
the Lebanese crisis. Iraq, an enemy of Syria, is the Christians'
main arms supplier.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said:
``We feel there is no justification for continued military action in
the face of urgent appeals and we urge all sides to ... observe a
cease-fire on all fronts.''
   Fighting began March 8 between the 20,000 soldiers of Gen. Michel
Aoun's Christian army command and an alliance of 40,000 Syrian
soldiers and Moslem militias.
   The Syrians are in Lebanon under an Arab League mandate dating
from 1976, the year after Lebanon's civil war began. Aoun says they
are an occupation army and has declared a ``war of liberation'' to
drive them out.
   Police said the Syrians opened up with truck-mounted multiple
rocket launchers soon after midnight as the hydrofoil Santa Maria
docked at Jounieh, a Christian port 12 miles north of Beirut. The
launchers can fire 40 rounds a minute.
   ``Arriving passengers had just disembarked and departing
passengers were gathered on the dock to board the vessel when the
rocketing started,'' a port spokesman said.
   ``The rockets fell around the Santa Maria,'' he said. ``One of
them crashed into the dock close to where the passengers were,
wounding seven people,'' and the ship ``sped away immediately.''
   Tony Mansour, spokesman for the Santa Maria's agents in Larnaca,
Cyprus, said rockets began exploding around the ship before the crew
had unloaded the baggage of 120 passengers who got off at Jounieh.
   Only eight of the 300 waiting passengers had boarded when the
Santa Maria left.
   All but 150,000 of Beirut's 1.5 million people have abandoned it
for safer areas in the south and east or have left Lebanon
altogether, according to police. They have not returned since the
U.N. action, fearing a renewal of savage artillery battles.
   ``What the Security Council's call for a cease-fire has achieved
is nothing but a fragile lull accompanied by intermittent clashes
and troop reinforcements as if all the factions are preparing
themselves for a new round of war,'' the respected Beirut newspaper
An-Nahar said.
   Farid Hamadeh, who owns a motel on the seaside highway south of
Beirut, said:
   ``It seems everyone expects a new round of ferocious violence.
The 40 rooms are full. No one is checking out. All my clients have
apartments in Beirut, but they've been staying here for quite a
while to escape the shelling.
   ``Here we are relatively close to Beirut. They hear the shell
explosions, watch artillery and rocket flashes in Beirut during the
night and drive to the city during relative lulls to check on their
apartments and businesses.''
   French envoy Alain Decaux held separate talks with Maronite
Catholic patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir and Aoun, but would speak with
reporters.
   He arrived Thursday and met in west Beirut with acting Prime
Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem, and Hussein Husseini, the
Shiite Moslem speaker of Parliament.
   Hoss heads a Moslem cabinet competing for power with Christian
government led by Aoun.
   An aide to Hoss said Decaux would ``submit a report of his
observations to his superiors, who would work on a plan to stabilize
the situation in Lebanon.''
   France governed Lebanon by mandate until 1943. It sent the
destroyer Duquesne and aircraft carrier Foch to the area this week
``to aid the French community'' of 7,000, about 85 percent of whom
have dual citizenship.

   A bomb planted in the luggage rack of a
bus exploded Friday as the vehicle was passing a market in a
northern town, killing at least 15 people and wounding 30, police
said.
   The victims of the blast at Chintpurni in Himachal Pradesh state
included two women and two children, police said.
   There were no claims of responsibility for the explosion but Sikh
militants agitating for an independent nation in Punjab were
suspected, police officials said.
   The bus was coming from the Sikh holy city of Amritsar in
neighboring Punjab state and was passing Chintpurni's main market
when the explosion occurred.
   Most of the victims were on the bus, but at least four people on
the street sustained injuries, said police officials in the town.
   They spoke on condition of anonymity in telephone calls from
Chandigarh, the capital of Punjab, about 70 miles north of
Chintpurni.
   Ravi Kanth Bahl, a doctor in a government-owned hospital in the
neighboring town of Una, said at least 12 people died before they
could be treated.
   ``I was told many more bodies would be coming,'' he said in a
telephone conversation from his hospital, the largest in the area.
Bahl said the blast appeared to have been ``extremely powerful''
because the victims' bodies were unidentifiable.
   A similar blast on a bus bound for Nsw Delhi from Chandigarh on
Aug. 9 left at least 18 people dead. Police said the explosion was
caused by a time bomb planted by the militants.
   Sikhs form only 2 percent of India's 880 million people but are
in a majority in Punjab. Radicals from the community have been
fighting for an independent nation since 1982, claiming they are
discriminated by the Hindus, who make up 80 percent of the country's
population.
   At least 1,200 people have been killed in Punjab this year in
violence blamed on the militants. In the latest violence, at least
18 people were killed on Thursday and Friday, Press Trust of India
said.
   The toll included 12 militants shot and killed by police and the
others were victims of the radicals, the news agency said.

<HEAD>Britain and Argentina Agree To Talks on Restoring Relations</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Britain and Argentina announced Friday they
would hold talks in October in Spain to consider restoring ties
severed by their war in 1982 over the Falklands Islands.
   Both sides called the agreement to meet in Madrid Oct. 17-18 a
breathrough and said they were optimistic that relations would be
normalized.
   A joint statement, issued after three days of talks in New York,
said the Madrid discussions would be held without prejudice to
sovereignty over the islands claimed by both Argentina and Britain.
   The negotiators will consider diplomatic and consular relations,
confidence-building measures to avoid military incidents, trade and
financial relations, air and sea communications links, fisheries,
contacts between the Falklands and the South American mainland and
cultural, scientific and sports relations, according to the report.
Sovereignty is not on the agenda.
   The Falklands, 325 miles off of Argentina's southern coast, are a
British colony. Britain has not eased its position on sovereignty
and British Ambassador Sir Crispen Tickell said the agreement to
hold normalization talks was due to the initiative of Argentina's
new president, Carlos Saul Menem.
   Tickell held the negotitaions with Argentine special
representative Ambassador Lucio Ggarcia del Solar.
   Both men read the communique and Tickell said later:
   ``I would call this (agreement) a breakthrough. This development
is very important for Anglo-Argentine relations and now enables us
to go forward on a new basis. ... I am optimistic because we have
agreed to an agenda and to hold talks without prejudice to the
sovereignty position on either side.''
   Garcia del Solar told reporters, ``These contacts (with Britain)
began since President Menem openly said he wanted a solution on the
basis shown in this communique today.''
   Argentina invaded and occupied the Falklands in April 1982 but
Britain sent a task force and recaptured the islands in a 74-day war
that claimed nearly 1,000 lives.
   The Falklands, known in Argentina as the Malvinas, has a
population of about 2,000 and most of the islanders are of British
descent.
   Britain has said it will not relinquish sovereignty over the
islands and Menem dropped the previous government's insistence that
Argentina's sovereignty claim would have to be the first issue
considered in normalization talks.
   The communique said it was agreed that the Madrid talks ``would
take place under the terms of a formula to protect the position of
each side with regard to sovereignty or territorial and maritime
jurisdiction over the Falkland Islands, South Georgia and the South
Sandwich Islands and the surrounding maritime areas.''

<HEAD>Flag Burning, Quayle Highlight VFW Convention</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   About 25,000 members of the Veterans of Foreign
Wars gather this weekend for their 90th annual convention and an
agenda that includes resolutions against desecrating the American
flag and a speech by Vice President Dan Quayle.
   The flag ``will be the convention's most emotional issue,'' VFW
spokesman Wade LaDue predicted Friday.
   The five-day convention, which begins Monday, is expected to be
the 2 million-member organization's largest in recent memory, LaDue
said.
   Defense Secretary Richard Cheney, Veterans Affairs Secretary
Edward Derwinski and Gen. Colin L. Powell, who was nominated last
week to be chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, also are scheduled
to speak to the convention.
   The VFW also plans to honor Adm. William Crowe Jr., the retiring
chairman of the Joint Chiefs, four Navy aviators who shot down
Libyan MiG fighter jets over the Mediterranian Sea on Jan. 4, and
singer Wayne Newton.
   A memorial service for fallen comrades is scheduled for the eve
of the convention Sunday.
   Quayle is scheduled to address the gathering's opening session
Monday morning.
   That afternoon, the veterans will begin considering about 500
resolutions covering a wide range of issues. Twenty-five resolutions
are expected on the flag desecration issue alone, LaDue said.
   The U.S. Supreme Court on June 21 ruled that burning the flag as
a political protest is protected by the First Amendment guarantee of
freedom of speech.
   The decision prompted widespread protests on both sides of the
issue, and President Bush proposed a constitutional amendment
banning desecrating the flag, which the VFW supports.
   Larry Rivers, the group's commander-in-chief and a Marine who
served in Vietnam, said Friday that the nation's veterans are not
ready to concede that flag burning is a free-speech issue.
   At a banquet Monday night, the VFW will honor Newton for
entertaining troops around the world and Crowe for his contributions
``to the cause of national security, unity and world peace.''
   Derwinski is scheduled to speak Tuesday. The veterans' affairs
secretary is expected to discuss such topics as health care for
veterans.
   It will be Derwinski's second appearance before veterans here in
three weeks. On July 31, he appeared in Bush's place at the Disabled
American Veterans convention.
   On Tuesday night, the VFW will hold its annual parade in front of
Las Vegas' convention center.
   The four Navy aviators involved in the Libyan incident will be
honored on Wednesday. Navy representatives will accept the honor on
behalf of the aviators, who have not been identified for security
reasons, LaDue said.
   The convention ends Friday with Walter Hogan, a Korean War
veteran from Greenfield, Wis., assuming the post of
commander-in-chief.

<HEAD>Israel Offers to Coordinate Future Activities with Washington</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN ALT POWELL</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Israel has agreed to coordinate its military
activities with the United States if Washington stops criticizing
the Israeli abduction of a Shiite Moslem cleric, Israeli sources
said Friday.
   The kidnapping of Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid at his south Lebanon
home by Israeli commandos July 28 caused retaliatory threats against
American hostages in Lebanon.
   Some members of Congress denounced the abduction. President Bush
called for the release of all people held against their will and did
not exclude Obeid, who is affiliated with Hezbollah, the pro-Iranian
extremist group believed to sponsor hostage-holders.
   The captors of Lt. Col. Willian R. Higgins, a U.S. Marine
kidnapped while on U.N. duty in south Lebanon, said they hanged him
in retaliation three days after Obeid was seized, but there were
reports he had been killed months ago.
   Joseph Cicippio, one of the seven other American hostages, was
threatened with death, then given a reprieve.
   An Israeli source close to the government said Friday ``an
understanding'' was reached between Foreign Minister Moshe Arens and
Secretary of State James A. Baker III soon after the Obeid abduction
that they would adopt a joint policy for the hostage crisis.
   He added, on condition of anonymity: ``There is an expressed
Israeli commitment, when the crisis is over, to discuss with
Americans coordination of future Israeli activities that may have
bearing on American interests and citizens.''
   That, he said, was ``the price Israeli has paid for not being
criticized now by the United States.''
   Dan Naveh, an adviser to Arens, confirmed that Arens and Baker
discussed future coordination in the days after the kidnapping.
   ``They agreed not to get into this issue during the days of the
crisis, but in the future,'' Naveh said, and stressed that ``the
conclusion was to discuss the issue, not necessarily reach an
agreement.''
   He did not describe the agreement for consultation as an
exchange, but acknowledged that American criticism had abated.
   Avi Pazner, an adviser to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, said:
``In the first days after we captured Obeid, there was some
unhappiness in Washington about it. ... Since then we have
straightened out these matters through constant dialogue, and there
is no problem today.''
   The source close to the government said the Baker-Arens agreement
caused concern in military and intelligence circles.
   ``Israel always prided itself on its autonomy in terms of
strategy,'' the source said. ``There's a feeling that, in order to
get off the hook for a few days, Arens has mortgaged Israel's
freedom of maneuver.''
   A U.S. congresswoman who met with Shamir on Friday said she was
encouraged by hopes of resolving the hostage situation, but she also
said she was anxious about American hostage Terry A. Anderson, the
captive held longest.
   Rep. Louise Slaughter, a Democrat who represents the New York
state district where Anderson grew up, told reporters Shamir would
not give details on Israeli efforts to free the captives.
   She said she felt ``frustration, as I am sure Terry does, that
his government hasn't done much.''
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated
Press, was kidnapped March 16, 1985. Eight Westerners in addition to
the Americans are held in Lebanon.

<HEAD>EPA Says Lime Disease Fear Prompts Misuse of Sprays</HEAD>

   The fear of catching Lyme disease from tick
bites is causing people to use insect repellents in potentially
harmful ways, the Environmental Protection Agency said Friday.
   The EPA, which regulates the pesticides used in insect
repellents, said misuse of repellents could result in adverse skin
reactions, headaches, mood changes, and possibly even convulsions or
unconsciousness.
   Only a ``small number'' of reports of ill effects have been
received, but they have prompted ``concern that fear of Lyme disease
or the use of repellents for other biting pests may result in misuse
or oversuse of these products,'' the agency said.
   Cynthia Georgeson, a spokeswoman for S.C. Johnson Wax,
manufacturer of the insect repellent ``Off,'' said the company
endorsed the EPA advsisory because ``it's very important to have
people continue to use these products properly.''
   The company is the manufacturer of the widely used insect
repellent and accounts for about 70 percent of the repellent market.
   She said that because of the widespread publicity surrounding
Lyme disease, which is transmitted by deer ticks, sales of
repellents are expected to be about 10 percent higher this year.
``Off'' accounts for about 70 percent of the repellent market, she
said.
   Among the suggestions from the EPA are:
   _ Apply repellents only to exposed skin and not under clothing.
   _ Never use repellents over cuts, wounds or irritated skin.
   _ Take care to keep repellents away from the eyes and mouth or
the hands of small children.
   _ Avoid frequent reapplication or saturation of the skin. One
application is good for four to six hours, depending on strength,
says Ms. Georgeson.
   _ After returning indoors, wash repellent treated skin with soap
and water, especially if repellents have been used repeatedly during
the day.
   The EPA said further information about the active ingredients in
repellents and other information about their use can be obtained
from the National Pesticide Telecommunciations Network. Their
24-hour hotline number is 800-858-7378.

   The mayor and city manager of Del Rio, Texas,
asked the Defense Nuclear Agency on Friday to abandon consideration
of a local ranch for a series of underground explosions designed to
simulate the impact of Soviet nuclear warheads on subterranean
command centers.
   Petitions signed by nearly 12,000 Del Rio area residents opposed
to the tests on the Buck King ranch were presented to Vice Adm. John
T. Parker Jr., director of the Defense Nuclear Agency.
   The Del Rio officials are concerned about the impact of the
explosions on the border city's sole source of drinking water, San
Felipe Springs, which was contaminated by an unknown substance in an
underground cave-in earlier this week, forcing residents to boil or
drink bottled water for two days.
   ``We appreciate the opportunity to meet with the Del Rio mayor
and city manager. We better understand the concerns of the
citizens,'' Parker said after the session with Mayor Alfredo
Gutierrez Jr., a physician, and City Manager Jeffrey Pomeranz.
   ``We're going to do everything that is possible to stop it and we
so indicated to DNA,'' Gutierrez said.
   The Mexican government has also inquired about possible
explosions, in an Aug. 4 letter that the State Department answered
Thursday, an official at State said Friday.
   The official said the letter advises Mexico that an environmental
assessment of the site must still be completed before any tests
would be done.
   Agency spokeswoman Cheri Abdelnour said the agency continues to
assess the Del Rio site _ currently the only location nationally
under consideration for the series of underground explosions _ and
will not make a final decision until technical and environmental
assessments are completed.
   The environmental assessment may take until January 1990 to
finish, she said.
   ``Clearly, we will not be doing anything until that assessment is
made _ the technical assessment as well as the environmental
assessment,'' she said.
   The DNA, an agency of the Defense Department, spent two years
picking a site for the tests.
   The explosions would start with a 1,000-pound charge in 1990,
increasing to 470 tons, an equivalent of 300 tons of TNT, in
November 1992.
   Ms. Abdelnour said the tests would be performed with the same
conventional explosives used by the mining industry, and do not
involve nuclear or radioactive devices.
   ``They are designed to have no significant adverse impact on the
environment, including the water system,'' Ms. Abdelnour said.
   But Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texxas, said local officials and residents
have expressed great concern about the impact on the explosions on
the springs, which provides water to the city of 40,000 and to
nearby Laughlin Air Force Base.
   ``Given the 12,000 people who have signed a petition, and the
great local concern about the tests, I think it would save the DNA's
money to simply go ahead and make the decision and look for another
test area,'' Gramm said.

   The Bush administration reacted
cautiously Friday to reports that a Solidarity activist would be
named Poland's prime minister and to questions whether increased
U.S. economic aid might flow to such a government.
   ``We will continue to watch the process and will increase aid as
appropriate and as we can,'' presidential press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater told reporters.
   Fitzwater, in Maine with the vacationing President Bush, said
discussion of any increase in the $119 million aid package Bush
announced last month was premature. He said too little is known
about the structure of Poland's changing government.
   ``It's too early at this point to know how they (Poland's
leaders) are going to make it work, let alone how it will work,''
Fitzwater said.
   At the State Department in Washington, spokesman Richard Boucher
said, ``We've got a lot under way to do the steps the president's
already announced, and that's our priority right now.''
   Fitzwater suggested the Bush administration had no major problems
with a coalition government in which a non-communist prime minister
will divide authority with a communist president, although it means
the communists will still control the military, the police and the
courts.
   He applauded Poland for ``the changes that have been made there''
over the past months toward more democracy.
   ``All the words I said yesterday are operable today. You may use
them freely,'' said Fitzwater. On Thursday, the spokesman called
movement toward a non-communist government in Poland
``history-making and remarkable.''
   Fitzwater said the administration would reserve formal comment on
news reports that Polish President Wojciech Jaruzelski had chosen
Solidarity activist Tadeusz Mazowiecki to be the new prime minister
and lead the East bloc's first non-communist government.
   Still, White House aides privately said they were pleased with
the apparent choice of Mazowiecki, a journalist and close associate
of Solidarity leader Lech Walesa.
   Fitzwater told reporters that letters from the president to
Walesa and Jaruzelski being carried by Senate Minority Leader Bob
Dole, R-Kan., were ``just letters of greeting'' and did not contain
messages on the current power shuffle. Dole left Washington Friday
on a trip that will include a visit to Poland.
   Bush has said his administration would reward Poland for
political reform, and he unveiled the $119 million package of U.S.
aid during his visit to Poland last month.
   Fitzwater said U.S. budget restraints continue to be a factor in
any possible boost in U.S. aid. ``We don't have a lot of money to
offer.''
   ``At this point, it's just far too early to talk about signals of
what we will do (in terms of more U.S. aid) or what's available to
us,'' Fitzwater said.
   Walesa told Bush in July that Poland will need at least $10
billion in international aid. U.S. allies are expected to meet in
Europe in late September to discuss a multi-nation rescue package to
supplement the U.S. aid.
   At the State Department, Boucher said the next step involves
``the concerted international efforts.''
   ``The Summit Seven agreed to a program of concerted efforts to
promote reform in Poland and Hungary. Twenty-four countries attended
the first meeting on Aug. 1, at which food assistance was discussed.
The next meeting is scheduled for late September,'' he said.
   Fitzwater said that the new Polish government, no matter what
precise form it takes, has its work cut out for it getting the
nation's financial house in order.
   ``Economically it is going to be very difficult'' for any new
government in Poland. He said problems would ``take a good deal of
patience and determination'' to solve.
   The spokesman said that the White House has had no direct contact
with officials in Poland. ``We're just watching things as they
happen,'' he said.
   ``The situation is changing rapidly there and we would prefer not
to have any further comment on the process until we reach a point
where we have some assurances of how the government is going to be
formed,'' he added.
   On another subject, Fitzwater said former President Carter was
acting on his own in inviting warring factions in Ethiopia to meet
with him in Atlanta next month for peace talks.
   ``He is not acting on behalf of the U.S. government and does not
have any official capacity or endorsement by us,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``Obviously, if he can be successful or be a help in pulling the
parties together there, that's all for the better,'' he said. ``But
it's strictly a private initiative.''
   On the second day of his 2{-week vacation, Bush went boating with
family members and played a round of golf.
   Bush kept up the constant banter with reporters on the golf
course that has often marked his outings here.
   As he teed off on the first hole, Bush told reporters:
   ``The crowd is hushed. They sense that `Mr. Smooth.' is back.''
   Asked if he had seen a television interview the night before with
Vice President Dan Quayle, Bush answered:
   ``No, I didn't see it last night. I'm on my vacation.''

<HEAD>Castro Says Attacks Could Delay Withdrawl of Cuban Troops from Angola</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cuban President Fidel Castro has warned that
guerrilla attacks on Cuban troops in Angola could delay the promised
withdrawal of the soldiers from that African country, Cuba's
official news agency said Friday.
   The Prensa Latina agency said that in a letter to U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, Castro accused
anti-communist rebels of attacking Cuban forces.
   ``These criminal and irresponsible actions could have serious
consequences,'' Castro said in the letter, according to the Prensa
Latina dispatch monitored in Mexico City. ``They could influence in
an adverse way the compliance with the timetable on withdrawal of
Cuban troops from Angola.''
   Cuba, under an agreement on a U.N. plan for independence for
Namibia, pledged to withdraw all of its troops from Angola by July
1, 1991.
   Prensa Latina quoted Castro's letter as saying: ``On the morning
of Aug. 14 a group of 15-20 armed subversives of UNITA ambushed a
Cuban truck 16 miles north of Cubal'' and killed six Cuban soldiers.
   ``Because of this act, the Cuban government wants to reiterate
that it will act in whatever manner guarantees, in whatever
circumstance, the security of its internationalist combatants in
Angola,'' the letter said.
   UNITA is the acronym for the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola, a rebel group that has been battling
Angola's Marxist government since Angola gained its independence
from Portugal in 1975.
   Cuba's deputy foreign minister, Ricardo Alarcon Quesada, has said
Cuba had up to 50,000 military personnel in Angola helping the
government fight the rebels. About 1,000 Cuban soldiers have been
killed in Angola in the past 10 years, according to a report by
Jorge Risquet, a member of Cuba's Communist Party Politburo.
   Western estimates are that 5,000 Cuban troopers have been killed
in Angola. UNITA claims that figure is low.
   Namibia, also known as South-West Africa, has been administered
by South Africa since the end of World War I. South Africa in
December agreed to the U.N. independence plan for the territory
sandwiched between Angola and South Africa with the condition that
Cuba withdraw its military force from Angola.

<HEAD>Former Defense Minister Sentenced To Death</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A military court sentenced the former
defense minister to death Friday for ordering the ritual murder of a
policeman so his blood could be used in an attempted coup against
President Samuel Doe.
   Doe must approve the sentence against Maj. Gen. Gray Allison,
which would be carried out by firing squad.
   Maj. Gen. Kpenkrah Konah, chairman of the court-martial board,
told Allison: ``The court in closed session and upon secret ballot,
has found you guilty of the charge of murder.''
   Allison had been defense minister of this West African nation
since 1982, two years after a coup put Doe in power, but Doe
dismised him in July after he was charged in the March 31 ritual
murder of patrolman Melvin Pyne.
   Prosecution witnesses said Allison paid for the killing, Pyne's
body was decapitated and Allison planned to use the policeman's
blood in a ritual intended to help him overthrow Doe.
   The general's wife, Angeline, and seven other people are to be
tried by a civilian court in connection with the slaying.
   Allison denied involvement in the killing and, on Thursday, asked
Doe to spare him. He claimed police fabricated the charges and
coached the prosecution witnesses to lie.
   Several coup attempts against Doe, a former army sergeant, have
been reported since he led the coup on April 12, 1980, in which
President William R. Tolbert was overthrown and killed.

<HEAD>Unisys To Cut 6,000 Jobs In Restructuring</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIRA BILLIK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unisys Corp. will cut more than 6,000 jobs _
as much as 8 percent of the computer company's worldwide workforce _
by the end of 1990, in a restructuring plan announced Friday.
   The plan is, in effect, an acknowledgement by the hard-driving
chairman of Unisys, W. Michael Blumenthal, that the growth plans of
the nation's third-largest computer maker were too ambitious.
   ``The basic strategies are working as planned ... but our
operational profitability has clearly been inadequate for several
reasons, including the need to work off excess inventories, weaker
than expected U.S. demand, and sharper competition in all industry
segments worldwide,'' Blumenthal said in a statement.
   Blumenthal had envisioned turning Unisys into a $20 billion
company by 1993 to make the company a more credible competitor to
No. 1 International Business Machines Corp.
   Company spokesman Michael A. Stugrin said Friday the $20 billion
goal was merely a dollar figure indicating the growth the company
wanted to achieve.
   ``In the 1989-90 time frame, our major emphasis is operational
profitability and profit margins. We're looking for growth in
revenue and in market share.''
   The restructuring plan, part of a review of all company
operations to be completed by September, is designed to combat an
unexpected drop in domestic demand and tougher competition in the
industry worldwide.
   It follows a 67 percent drop in second-quarter earnings and a
first-half loss of $25.1 million for the company formed in 1986 by
the $4.8 billion purchase of Sperry Corp. by Burroughs Corp.
   Blumenthal said Unisys will cut annual costs by $400 million by
the end of 1990.
   Over the same period, Unisys plans to cut its worldwide workforce
of 88,000 by 7 to 8 percent through attrition and layoffs, Stugrin
said. That amounts to between 6,000 and 7,000 workers, he said.
   Since Unisys has been under a hiring and salary freeze since the
end of the second quarter, employees who retire or leave the company
will not be replaced, Stugrin said.
   Stugrin said a major focus of the job cuts will be in the United
States, where he said ``the softest market conditions prevail,
unfortunately.''
   He said Unisys had ``taken pains to make sure our people
understand the trends in the industry and in the marketplace'' and
that the company had ``a sense of determination to see this through
and go on to better conditions.''
   In the second quarter, Unisys recorded net income of $53.6
million compared with $162.3 million for the same period a year
earlier, the decline attributed to a drop in inventory, pricing
pressure from competitors, and the Pentagon's temporary suspension
of its defense business.
   Blumenthal had also attributed the earnings drop to the rise in
the dollar, decreasing the dollar value of sales made in foreign
currencies.
   In the first half of the year, Unisys lost $25.1 million,
compared with a profit of $311.6 million a year earlier.
   Blumenthal said Unisys is confident it will achieve positive
results and greater profits in 1990.
   In addition to being a major computer maker, Unisys is the
nation's 15th largest defense contractor and received $1.4 billion
in contracts from the Pentagon in 1988.
   IBM's revenue this year will be nearly $60 billion. Digital
Equipment Corp. ranks second with nearly $13 billion in annual
revenue. Unisys is third with a little under $10 billion in revenue.

<HEAD>UN Chief Urges Iran, Iraq, To Release POWs and Negotiate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
urged Iran and Iraq on Friday to release prisoners, withdraw their
troops to recognized borders and resume stalled negotiations for a
peace treaty.
   ``As we observe the anniversary of the cease-fire, I call on the
leaders of Iran and Iraq to join me in a renewed effort to complete
this task'' of implementing the U.N. peace plan ``as the way to
achieve an overall political settlement,'' he said in a statement.
   He called for security and stability in the region, and ``peace
which only can be lasting if it is base on the principle of no
victor, no vanquished.''
   A U.N.-mediated cease-fire took effect Aug. 20, 1988, and peace
negotiations began in Geneva five days later, under U.N. auspices.
   The cease-fire has held, but talks stalled after several
sessions. The U.N. plan for withdrawal and repatriation of POWs has
not been implemented and Iraq has injected new elements, including
clearing of the Shatt-al-Arab waterway, the southern border between
the Persian Gulf neighbors.
   In his statement, Perez de Cuellar said the U.N. plan, Security
Council Resolution 598 ``cannot be renegotiated. It represents a
peace plan that must be implemented.''
   ``Countless lives have been spared'' and tension has been reduced
because of the truce, he said, but ``there is no reason for
complacency, for the silencing of guns does not mean the restoration
of security and stability in the region.''

   The Kremlin has decided to allow the first

there urging greater independence for the Baltic republic, officials
said Friday.
   Sen. Robert Kasten, R-Wis., was scheduled to leave Saturday for

republics by Moscow during World War II. He was to deliver a speech
blaming Soviet authorities for environmental pollution in Latvia.
   ``The government in Moscow is not accountable to the people of
Latvia, or even to the people of Moscow _ and the result is
environmental disaster,'' Kasten was to say in the speech, which was
provided in advance to The Associated Press.
   State Department officials, who spoke on condition they not be
further identified, described the Kremlin decision to allow Kasten
to travel to Latvia and deliver such a critical speech as another
sign of change in the Soviet Union.
   The Bush administration did not object to the visit, said the
officials, despite long-standing U.S. policy not to recognize
Moscow's 1940 annexation of Latvia and its two sister republics,
Lithuania and Estonia. Under this policy, U.S. officials are barred
from having business contacts with senior Communist Party and
government officials in the Baltics republics.
   Kasten was taking part in the ``International Conference on
Self-Determination,'' organized by the National Independence
Movement of Latvia. In a news release, the group described itself as
``an organization campaigning for Latvia's independence from the
U.S.S.R.''
   The group said other congressional visits were expected to Latvia
this autumn.
   Kasten said in his prepared remarks ``officials in Moscow who
make decisions about the use of resources have no interest in
protecting the environment of the Baltic region. Their interest is
in promoting heavy industry _ and in removing the pollution caused
by that industry from the region of Moscow.''
   ``The answer is decentralization, a government closer to the
people. Decisions about the Latvian environment need to be made by
the Latvians _ the people whose children will have to inherit the
Latvia environment from their parents,'' said the speech.
   Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia scored a victory last month when
the national parliament gave preliminary approval to legislation
that would grant them greater economic autonomy, including the right
to print their own currency, starting next Jan. 1.
   That autonomy would include greater control over heavy
industries, which are now run by ministries based in Moscow.
   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda signalled on Thursday that
further liberalization was in the wind by suggesting a
reorganization of the Soviet Union to grant even more power to its
15 constituent republics at the expense of central authorites in
Moscow.

<HEAD>Contra Leader Announces Return to Nicaragua</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leader of the Nicaraguan
Resistance, the executive branch of the Contra rebels, said Friday
he would return to Nicaragua and join the political opposition.
   Under terms of a Central American peace plan, Nicaragua's
Sandinista government has offered amnesty to rebels who return and
enter the domestic political process.
   Roberto Ferrey, who has been a member of the rebel executive
board since 1987, made his announcement in letters to Joao Baena
Soares, secretary-general of the Organization of American States,
and Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, Roman Catholic archbishop of
Managua.
   In a statement released to news organizations, Ferrey said he
would return on Tuesday. His letter said he would join the National
Opposition Union, a diverse coalition of opposition parties.
   Central American presidents agreed earlier this month to disband
the U.S.-supported rebels before the end of the year. In return,
Nicaragua agreed to hold free and fair elections in February.
   About 11,000 Contras and 12,000 dependents live in camps in
Honduras. Congress ended military aid last year, but provides $4.5
million a month in humanitarian assistance.
   Nicaragua and the Contras agreed March 21 to suspend military
operations, but negotiations toward a permanent end to the
7-year-old war have made little progress.

<HEAD>Talks on East German Refugees at Impasse</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's chief of staff
met with a top East German official Friday but reported the two
Germanies are at an impasse over ways to deal with a crush of East
German refugees.
   West Germany closed its embassy in Hungary Monday because of the
number of East Germans who went there seeking to escape to the West.
   Kohl's chief of staff, Rudolf Seiters, met in East Berlin for two
hours with East Germany's deputy foreign minister, Herbert
Krolikowski.
   ``Unfortunately it has to be said that East Germany is not
prepared to go beyond its original promise,'' Seiters told reporters
after the meeting.
   Communist East Germany has said would-be refugees who return
voluntarily will not be punished but it has given them no assurances
their applications to emigrate will be approved.
   Kohl said earlier Friday that he was willing to personally take
up the issue with East German leader Erich Honecker if that was
necessary to ease the strained relations between the two German
states.
   Honecker's has said the relations will become even more difficult
if West Germany continues to shelter more than 300 East Germans at
its embassies and diplomatic missions in Hungary, Poland,
Czechoslovakia and East Berlin.
   West Germany has issued more than 800 passports to other East
German refugees in Hungary who arrived after the embassy was closed.
   Seiters said West Germany wants an impovement in relations ``but
for the foreseeable future they are going to be strained.'' No
further negotiations were agreed to.
   West German government spokesman Herbert Schmuelling told a news
conference earlier Friday that Kohl received a letter from Honecker
Thursday night in reply to Kohl's request that joint efforts be made
to resolve the refugee situation.
   Schmuelling declined to disclose details of the letter but
government sources said Honecker's message resulted in Seiters'
being sent to meet with Krolikowski.
   The failure of that meeting could put pressure on Kohl to travel
to East Berlin to meet with Honecker.
   ``There is certainly no meeting scheduled as a normal course of
events, but it could be that if matters intensify at the Budapest
embassy, that direct contacts would be demanded,'' Kohl told the ARD
broadcast network Friday afternoon. ``I would do this immediately if
it appeared necessary.''
   Honecker made an official trip to Bonn in September 1987. Kohl
has not returned the visit and has suggested such a meeting depends
in part on improved relations.
   East Germans, angered at the lack of reform in their country,
have been going by the hundreds to neighboring Hungary, which began
dismantling its barbed-wire border with neutral Austria in May. East
Germans can travel freely to Hungary as another Soviet-bloc country.
   At least 1,600 East Germans are thought to have escaped
undetected, based on the number of refugees showing up at the West
German Embassy in Vienna for help in obtaining West German documents.
   Foreign Ministry sources reported Thursday that 1,100 East
Germans sought papers from the Vienna embassy during the first two
weeks of August.
   East Germans are automatically entitled to West German
citizenship under the West German constitution but they need exit
visas from their government to go to the West.

   A reserve soldier under investigation in the
beating death of a Palestinian shot himself to death with a
submachine gun, and news reports Friday said he did it because he
feared being blamed for the slaying.
   In the West Bank, a village leader was killed by an assailant who
suspected him of cooperating with Israeli authorities, Arab reports
said. The reports said Abdel Rahim Awad, 62, was shot 14 times in
the chest in Kafr Laqif.
   The army confirmed the slaying. Awad is the 96th Palestinian
killed by his fellow Arabs on suspicion of cooperating with Israeli
authorities.
   In the Gaza Strip, the army sealed three rooms in homes owned by
Palestinians accused of attacking Arab collaborators, an army
spokesman said.
   Troops shot and wounded three Palestinians in Gaza, including a
17 year old who was in critical condition, Arab hospital officials
said. An army spokesman said the military is investigating the
incidents.
   Also Friday, a new security policy that requires Gaza Strip
residents to show computerized identification cards before entering
Israel took effect.
   Traffic to Israel from Gaza was light, but officials said that
was mainly because Friday is a Moslem prayer day, not because of a
strike call by Palestinian activists opposed to the new cards.
   Israeli newspapers reported that reserve soldier Yariv Bar-Yosef
finished work as a night guard at the state-run television studio
Thursday, put an Uzi submachine gun to his head and shot himself.
   In a suicide letter, Bar-Yosef, 25, said he faced questioning by
military police and feared he would become a scapegoat for other
soldiers involved in the beating death of Hani el-Shami in August
1988, the reports said.
   They quoted his letter as referring to Israel as ``a land that
devours its people.''
   An army spokesman refused comment on the suicide, saying the case
was under investigation.
   Four soldiers of an elite infantry brigade were charged with
beating to death el-Shami while on patrol. They were acquitted of
manslaughter but convicted of brutality after a military tribunal
ruled that el-Shami died of beatings inflicted at the Jabaliya
detention center, where he was taken after being beaten by the
soldiers.
   Bar-Yosef served at the detention center and told investigators
he kicked el-Shami in the shoulder the day he died.
   At least 537 Palestinians have been killed in clashes with
soldiers or Israelis since the uprising against Israeli rule of the
West Bank and Gaza Strip began in December 1987. Thirty-eight
Israelis have died.
   The army spokesman said the military sealed rooms in three Gaza
homes owned by Arabs accused of membership in ``popular
committees,'' attacking Arabs who cooperated with Israel and
threatening an Arab policeman who worked with the military
authorities.
   Israel says sealing or demolishing homes is necessary as a means
of deterrence. The army has sealed or demolished at least 330 home
in the occupied territories during the uprising against Israeli
occupation.
   The United States and European nations have condemned the
measures as violations of human rights.
   Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip were ordered to
boycott their jobs in Israel, starting Friday, to protest the new ID
cards. Israel radio said some Arab workers spent Thursday night in
Israel to avoid crossing the checkpoint.
   Israeli officials said they introduced the cards to prevent Arabs
with criminal or security records from entering Israel, but
Palestinian reporters said the new system is an attempt to put
economic pressure on Gazans who work in Israel.

   Through tears, a grieving foster mother
said she's determined to keep alive the memory of a 2-year-old she
raised most of his short life so she can prove his death is worth
more than 30 days' pay.
   The parents of Bradley McGee are charged with murder. Authorities
said the child was repeatedly plunged headfirst into a toilet bowl
during potty training. His July 28 death set off controversy
throughout Florida about handling of abuse cases.
   The boy might be alive today if social workers had followed their
policy for protecting abused children, a state investigator
concluded.
   Four state child care workers knew Brad was subjected to physical
abuse and ``bizarre punishment'' at home, didn't report it and
recommended the child be returned to his parents, the investigator
said.
   The Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services
called it an error in judgment and disciplined the workers, ranging
from a written reprimand to 30 days' suspension.
   ``A child is dead,'' said Pam Kirkland, who wanted to adopt Brad.
``A judgment call results in a preventable death and disciplinary
action is no more than 30 days without pay? Is that all a child's
life is worth today?''
   Mrs. Kirkland spent 14 months caring for Brad while he was under
the protection of HRS.
   The boy died with multiple bruises on his face, abdomen, buttocks
and groin. But that's not what killed the blond, blue-eyed toddler.
   Shoving him untold times headfirst into a toilet bowl did, the
medical examiner's office said. His brain hemorrhaged.
   Brad's mother, Sheryl McGee Coe, 20, and stepfather, Tom Coe, 22,
are accused of killing the boy for soiling his pants. They told
police they were potty-training him. Mrs. Coe is expecting her third
child later this month. Her second child, a 13-month-old girl, was
placed in foster care after Bradley's death.
   No trial has been scheduled.
   Brad had been under the care of HRS since his mother abandoned
him malnourished and congested when he was 4 months old. She left
him with a stranger, a pretzel vendor, at a mall.
   Two months before his death he was returned to his parents.
   Pam Kirkland and her husband, Jim, had warned HRS against it. A
child protection team, a group of medical and social work
professionals that weigh cases for the state, had advised against it
in a psychological evaluation of the parents. And on July 3, HRS
received a report of abuse. The reports were not brought to the
attention of a judge who approved the reunification.
   Others say they reported problems, but the agency says it only
has record of one call to its abuse hot line.
   Following an investigation by the HRS inspector general, the
agency suspended the caseworker without pay for 30 days, suspended
an administrator without pay for three weeks, reprimanded a program
director and demoted a supervisor.
   Since March 1988, five Tampa Bay area children have died from
child abuse while under HRS supervision.
   ``How many more children will die if nothing is done, and right
away?'' Mrs. Kirkland asked. She is urging the governor to call a
special legislative session. The state attorney is investigating
handling of the case.
   Signatures are being collected on 20,000 petitions that ask the
governor to make it tougher for parents to get their kids back.
   Inspector General Jerry Slavens agrees with Mrs. Kirkland and
says the law should be changed ``so that the safety of the child
comes first as opposed to family reunification.''
   The first six months Brad was in HRS custody, his parents never
contacted the agency, according to state reports.
   He called the Kirklands ``mommy'' and ``daddy.'' They called him
``Brabbee.''
   ``He was happy, bright, and a clown. He loved to dance. He'd hear
music and turn himself around,'' said Mrs. Kirkland, sitting at her
dining room table surrounded by pictures of Brad. In every pose, he
was smiling.
   ``He was also very sensitive,'' she said. Even a gentle scolding
would bring tears.
   At the Kirklands, Brad rode around in a fenced yard on his
favorite dump truck. When he was wet, he'd bring a clean diaper to
Pam to change him. When Kirkland, a teacher, came home from work,
he'd race to the door giggling ``daddy home.''
   ``He had so much love to give and wanted so much to be loved,''
said Mrs. Kirkland, fighting back tears. ``He would cling with his
arms around me.''
   On May 24, HRS workers took Brabbee back to the Coes. The
Kirklands said they were told they could not see him again because
he had bonded to them and wasn't bonding to his parents.
   Two months later he was dead.
   ``What went through that child's mind,'' Mrs. Kirkland wondered.
``Was he thinking, `What did I do? Why don't they come get me?' ...
And when he was unplugged from that respirator, was there anyone
that loved him there to hug him?''

<HEAD>Czechoslovakia to Seek Compensation from Hungary on Project</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government demanded Friday that
Hungary pay damages for the decision to suspend work on its part of
a joint Danube River dam project because of enviromental concerns.
   ``Pointing out the damages caused by the delay of construction
works, the Czechoslovak side announces it will start seeking
compensation,'' said a statement carried by CTK, the official news
agency.
   It said the Hungarian Embassy had been given a Foreign Ministry
note saying ``responsibility for the one-sided decision of the
Hungarian government is fully on the Hungarian side, as it was
adopted in contradiction to international law.''
   It did not say how much compensation would be sought or give
other details.
   Hungary announced a moratorium May 13 on its part of the
Gabcikovo-Nagymaros project, which involves dams, canals and power
stations.
   Environmentalists in Hungary, one of the most liberal Soviet bloc
nations, and in the West have criticized the power project for years
as a threat to wildlife and wetlands.
   There has been no public criticism in Czechoslovakia, which
tolerates litte dissent.
   Before the suspension, a Hungarian government commission called
Gabcikovo-Nagymaros a ``symbol of Hungary's mismanaged past.''
   Czechoslovakia says the power station it has nearly completed at
Gabcikovo, 40 miles east of Bratislava, cannot operate as
efficiently as planned without the Nagymaros dam.
   ``The note confirms the Czechoslovak government's decision of May
15 to insist on honoring the agreement to construct the
abovementioned water project,'' CTK reported.
   The agreement to build the project was signed in 1977. Hungarian
construction lagged far behind the Czechoslovaks even before the
suspension.

<TEXT>
   President Ranasinghe Premadasa has met
with leaders of a political alliance with links to radical Sinhalese
and appealed for a cease-fire, an official said Friday.
   The official in the presidential secretariat spoke on condition
he not be identified.
   He said Premadasa met with leaders of the Sri Lanka Progressive
Front Thursday and suggesed a week-long cease-fire as the first step
toward peace negotiations with the radicals. He said no decision was
reached during the 90-minute talks.
   It was the first meeting between the president and the front
which is believed to have close links to Sinhalese groups that have
been waging a terrorist campaign against the government. The
violence has taken at least 4,000 lives.
   Samuel Dias Bandaranayake, president of the front, told The
Associated Press he asked Premadasa to step down and hold
parliamentary and presidential elections.
   He said he also called for abrogating a 1987 agreement between
Sri Lanka and India, which was aimed at ending the war by ethnic
Tamil separatists demanding an independent nation.
   Sinhalese militants rejected the accord, saying it gave too many
concessions to the minority Tamils and infringed on Sri Lanka's
sovereignity by allowing Indian troops to operate on the island
nation.
   The Tamils, most of whom are Hindus, make up 18 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million people. They claim discrimination by the
predominantly Buddhist Sinhalese.
   About 60 million Tamils live in southern India and under the 1987
pact India sent more than 40,000 military personnel to Sri Lanka to
enforce the plan that promised Tamils limited autonomy in exchange
for ending the guerrilla war.
   But the militant Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam rejected the
accord and has battled the Indian forces.
   At least 11,000 people, including 1,000 Indian soldiers, have
been killed in the separatist war launched by Tamil activists in
1983.

   A young man charged in a group sexual assault on a
17-year-old girl surrendered to police Friday, and a warrant has
issued for another suspect whose police lieutenant father
investigated the case, officials said.
   The young man pleaded innocent before Family Court Judge Julio
Fuentes to charges of conspiracy to commit sexual assault and
aggravated criminal sexual contact in the March 1 attack, said an
official familiar with the case who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The 18-year-old man, who was not identified despite his age
because the alleged crime occurred when he was 17, was released to
his parents' custody.
   On May 24, five high school students were arrested and charged
with participating in the assault on a special education student in
the affluent suburb of Glen Ridge. Officials at Glen Ridge High
School described many of those charged as student leaders, including
the captains of several school teams.
   Prosecutors alleged that the girl was assaulted with a broomstick
and a baseball bat at the home of two of the student athletes. The
girl went to West Orange High School, but lives in Glen Ridge and
knew the suspects.
   Fuentes on Friday postponed until Oct. 5 a hearing on whether to
try the young man and two other juveniles charged in the case as
adults, the official said.
   The lieutenant's son, 19-year-old Richard Corcoran Jr., is
expected to surrender Monday, the Essex County prosecutor's office
said in a news release. The release did not state when the warrant
for him was issued.
   Corcoran is to be arraigned in Essex County Superior Court on
charges of conspiracy to commit sexual assault, aggravated sexual
assault and aggravated sexual conduct, the release said.
   Corcoran's father is Glen Ridge's chief detective and led the
investigation into the incident. He was taken off the case five
weeks after his son was identified as one of 13 people present
during the assault.
   Prosecutors originally described Corcoran as a witness, but said
the charges were brought after new evidence was obtained.
   Prosecutor's spokesman Ray Weiss declined to describe the
evidence, saying the case was still under investigation.
   Prosecutors have said the attack occurred in the home of Kevin
and Kyle Scherzer, 18-year-old twins who have been charged in the
case. Charges also were filed against Peter Quigley, 18, and the two
other juveniles.
   All are free on bond. A grand jury is scheduled to examine the
case next month.
   The charges against Corcoran resulted from a joint investigation
by Glen Ridge police and the prosecutor's office, the release said.
The probe began when it was learned the young man was present during
the attack.
   ``The fact that charges have been filed against Richard Corcoran
Jr. in no way implies that the Glen Ridge Police Department
committed any impropriety in connection with the investigation,''
the statement said.
   Glen Ridge police will continue to be involved in the
investigation, the prosecutor's office said. Glen Ridge Police Chief
Thomas Dugan declined to comment on the case or Lt. Corcoran's role
in it.

<TEXT>
   Tourists have been evacuated from the
resort island of Thassos in the northern Aegean because of a fire in
its mountain woodlands, officials said Friday.
   ``Ferryboats have been plying back and forth ... and just about
all visitors have left the island,'' said Christos Panagis, a harbor
officer in Kavala on the mainland 90 minutes from Thassos by boat.
   A police officer reached by telephone on Thassos said he could
not say how many tourists were evacuated but the process was orderly.
   An Athens radio station said Kavala fire officials believed the
fire, which started in four places simultaneously, was caused by
arson.
   Agriculture Minister Stavros Dimas said Friday that 25 percent of
the fires that have destroyed 50,000 acres of forest in 10 days were
started by arsonists.
   Air currents on the mountainous terrain of Thassos made it
difficult for five fire-fighting aircraft to dump water on the fires
moving toward the evacuated villages of Sotiros, Kallirahi, Agios
Giorgis, Prinos, Maries and Rahoni, officials said..
   Panagis said flames could be seen from the harbor in Limeni, the
island's main town, but fire-breaks were expected to keep the flames
away from the town.
   Thassos was put under a state of emergency Thursday. Soldiers and
fire-fighting equipment from throughout northern Greece were moved
in to combat the blaze.
   The Thassos police officer, who would not give his name, said
some barns and abandoned dwellings on the outskirts of villages had
been burned.
   The national forest fire control center would not say how large
an area had been destroyed by the fire, which began early Thursday,
but unofficial estimates put it at more than 8,600 acres.

<HEAD>Court Blocks New Cost Formula For Foreclosures</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Friday blocked the
Department of Veterans Affairs from implementing a regulation next
week on VA home loans that the mortgage industry says will leave it
holding the bag more often when borrowers default.
   U.S. District Judge George H. Revercomb said in his preliminary
injunction that VA appeared to have exceeded its legal authority
when it added the cost of borrowing funds to its formula for
determining the worth of foreclosed property.
   The regulations, which had been due to take effect Monday, would
change the calculation to arrive at how much the property is worth,
the standard VA uses to determine whether it will purchase
foreclosed properties with VA-guaranteed mortgages.
   The injunction remains in effect until a full hearing on the
complaint by the Mortgage Bankers Association can be heard. The
association, which represents some 2,200 mortgage lending
institutions, said in a statement that the hearing may not take
place for several months.
   ``This decision signals a victory for mortgage lenders, but the
real beneficiaries will be veterans who will be able to continue to
have access to low-downpayment VA mortgages,'' said Warren Lasko,
executive vice president of the organization.
   The organization says implementation of the regulation ``would
have seriously impaired a program that has successfully served over
13 million veteran homebuyers.''
   Under the veterans loan program, the VA guarantees to the
mortgage lender that it will pay 40 percent or 50 percent of the
mortgage debt if the borrower defaults. The maximum guarantee is
$36,000.
   Until 1984, VA bought the foreclosed property in nearly every
case, ``even when it did not make financial sense to do so,''
Revercomb noted in his ruling. But Congress, in the Deficit
Reduction Act, required a ``no-bid formula'' to specify when VA
would purchase the properties.
   VA, under the regulations, is required to calculate what the
property is worth by taking its fair market value _ the price it
would command in the real estate market _ and subtracting a variety
of costs. The VA would not repurchase homes that it would end up
reselling at a loss.
   The lawsuit was filed after the VA issued regulations July 19
adding ``cost of funds'' to the net worth formula. That is the cost
to the government of borrowing money to buy the foreclosed property
until it can be resold. The association contends this cost is not
permitted in the formula prescribed by Congress.
   ``When the regulation at issue here goes into effect, it is
undeniable that some mortgage bankers will be concretely and
monetarily injured because the VA will purchase fewer foreclosed
homes than it does now, thus placing more of the potential loss on
the mortgage banker,'' Revercomb said.
   Neither VA nor the Justice Department would comment immediately
on the ruling.
   Foreclosure actions on VA-backed loans have risen sharply in
recent years, due largely to the real estate slump in Texas and
Oklahoma. The Government National Mortgage Association, an arm of
the Department of Housing and Urban Development, says six lenders
defaulted in 1988 that had financial problems linked to the
so-called ``no-bids.''
   The president's budget message this year estimated the new
regulation would result in 10 percent fewer property acquisitions.
The industry group says its average loss on a piece of property VA
does not acquire is more than $18,000.
   According to a General Accounting Office report in July,
foreclosures rose from 13,729 in fiscal 1981 to 43,316 in 1987. In
those same two years, VA annual losses rose from $51 million to $615
million, GAO said.
   The industry group says its losses from VA's refusal to bid on
foreclosed property totaled $200 million last year.
   The report by GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, supported
the new regulations.

<HEAD>Magnetic Field Around Neptune Discovered By Voyager 2</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Voyager 2 space probe discovered that
a magnetic field surrounds Neptune, suggesting the planet is
enveloped by orbiting radiation belts and has an aurora like Earth's
northern lights, NASA announced Friday.
   Further study of the magnetic field should allow scientists to
determine the exact length of a day on Neptune, believed to be 17 to
18 Earth hours, and to gain better understanding of Neptune's
internal structure, said Mary Beth Murrill, a spokeswoman for NASA's
Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Just as Earth's magnetic field traps the Van Allen radiation
belts, Neptune's magnetic field also may help create radiation belts
around that planet. Scientists don't yet know if that poses a hazard
to Voyager 2's electronic components, Murrill said.
   Voyager was 2.74 billion miles from Earth and 5.92 million miles
from Neptune on Friday, speeding toward the giant gas planet at
42,236 mph.
   The spacecraft was launched in 1977 and explored Jupiter in 1979,
Saturn in 1981 and Uranus in 1986. Voyager 2 will make its closest
approach to Neptune at 8:59 p.m. PDT on Thursday when it flies about
3,000 miles over the cloudtops of the solar system's fourth-largest
planet.
   Voyager already has discovered four Neptunian moons in addition
to the two discovered from Earth, two partial rings, or ring arcs,
of debris orbiting the planet; and atmospheric patterns similar to
jet streams and giant cyclones on Earth.
   Discovery of Neptune's magnetic field was confirmed Friday by
intense, pulse-like radio emissions coming from the planet's
vicinity. Radio waves are generated when high-speed electrically
charged particles spiral into a planet's atmosphere along magnetic
field lines.
   ``Mercury, Earth, Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus have magnetic
fields, while Venus and Mars do not,'' the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration said in a news release. ``Whether Pluto has one
or not is unknown.
   ``A planetary magnetic field is a girdle of magnetic field lines
that surround a planet,'' the agency said. ``Such fields are thought
to be generated by fluid motion in a planet's core. (Molten iron in
Earth's core, for example).''
   Certain electrically charged particles in space spiral along
magnetic field lines toward Earth's poles, creating the northern and
southern lights. A magnetic field at Neptune means that planet also
may have auroras, NASA said.
   Scientists hope the magnetic field will allow them to understand
Neptune's internal structure. Voyager project scientist Edward Stone
has said he believes that Neptune's hydrogen-helium outer atmosphere
gradually gives way to a superhot slurry of hot water and rock
closer to the planet's center. That would mean that Neptune _ like
neighboring Uranus _ probably lacks a distinct sky-sea boundary.
   Some scientists believe radiation trapped by Uranus' magnetic
field bombards frozen natural gas on that planet's moons and rings
to turn them dark in color. Neptune's magnetic field may cause
similar radiation darkening of the Neptunian moons and ring arcs,
NASA said.
   The nature of Neptune's radio signal allowed scientists to
determine the emissions came from a magnetic field, not from
discharges of lightning in the atmosphere, said James Warwick, head
of Voyager's radio science team.
   ``The radio emissions are very intense, very impulsive and occur
in a limited range of frequency,'' Warwick, a scientist at Boulder,
Colo.-based Radiophysics Inc., said in the release.
   Once NASA confirmed the existence of Neptune's magnetic field
Friday, scientists found evidence for the telltale radio signals in
data collected by Voyager as early as Monday.
   ``Early analysis indicates Neptune's magnetic field is of an
intensity similar to the fields of Earth and Uranus,'' NASA said.
   Murrill said scientists don't yet know how Neptune's magnetic
field is aligned. Voyager found the axis of Uranus' magnetic field
was tilted about 60 degrees from the axis around which that planet
spins.
   Earth's north magnetic pole is tilted about 14 degrees from the
planet's north rotational axis.

<HEAD>Pittston Suspends Negotiations, Blames UMW For Violence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LEBANON, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pittston Coal Group Inc. suspended
negotiations Friday with the United Mine Workers for 10 days because
of escalating attacks on company employees and destruction of
company property, the company said.
   President Michael Odom said their workers are subjected daily to
threats of personal injury and physical violence.
   ``Meaningful negotiations are impossible when one party is
employing fear and terrorism as its principal negotiating
technique,'' he said.
   Earlier this week, two Pittston employees were injured when they
were hit by rocks as they were driving home from work, two employee
vehicles were burned, a company building was destroyed by fire and
numerous coal trucks were damaged, according to state police.
   Odom said one of the employees was still hospitalized Friday
after suffering compound fractures of his fingers, a broken nose and
multiple cuts and bruises.
   No one had been arrested in the incidents, but Odom blamed the
union for the violence.
   ``While giving lip service to non-violence the union has yet to
take any public steps deploring the acts of violence or to
discipline agents or members for the thousands of violent acts that
have occurred since the strike began April 5,'' Odom said in a
statement released from his Lebanon office.
   UMW president Richard Trumka, in Washington, D.C., said Pittston
was avoiding its obligation to help settle the contract dispute.
   ``The company has been trying to find a way to walk away from the
mediation process ... and Pittston is using this gesture as a
subterfuge to continue its pattern of bad-faith bargaining,'' Trumka
said.
   He said the union remains ``ready and willing'' to continue
mediation.$
   Contract talks were to have resumed Tuesday at a motel in
Duffield. There had been no progress in the negotiations in which
the union and company representatives gathered in separate
conference rooms, with a federal mediator relaying messages.
   U.S. District Judge Glen Williams, who initiated the resumption
of negotiations July 18 after they broke off in June, said Tuesday
he was optimistic the parties would soon be meeting and get the
talks off dead center.
   Odom said the union should be willing to denounce the violence
and to instruct its members that strike benefits will be withdrawn
from those involved in the violent acts. ``To do less would amount
to a tacit approval.''
   The strike involves Pittston's 1,695 union workers in Virginia,
West Virginia and Kentucky.

<HEAD>Science Panel Predicts 25 Percent Of Earth's Species To Become Extinct</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One quarter or more of the Earth's species of
animals, plants, microbes and fungi will become extinct without
measures to preserve them, a National Science Foundation study said
Friday.
   The study called for increased efforts in basic research and
education in an effort to preserve both individual species and
complete ecological systems.
   ``Unless the international community can reverse the trend,'' the
report said, ``the rate of extinction over the next few years is
likely to rise to at least 1,000 times the normal background rate of
extinction and will ultimately result in the loss of a quarter or
more of the species on Earth.''
   The report said that about 1.4 million species throughout the
world have been identified and named, but it estimated that the
total number of species may range from 5 million to 80 million.
   In the tropics and subtropices, the study said, there are 400,000
identified species, but the actual number of species in those
regions may be at least 3 million and perhaps as high as 30 million.
   The report called for increased efforts to identify and classify
the world's animals, plants, microbes and fungi, and to understand
the ecosystems in which they live. It called for greater support by
the federal government of such scientific studies.
   The NSF study also recommended greater efforts in education,
noting that teaching the young about biology and the environment
``is now as important to the national interest as early education in
mathematics and other sciences.''

<HEAD>Star Magazine Interviews Manson's Son</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard Kaplan, editor of Star magazine, said it
took just one day to find the son of Charles Manson.
   In an interview in its Aug. 21 issue, Star quotes Michael
Brunner, 21, as saying he's not proud of being Manson's son and
considers his father an ``evil person'' he has never tried to
contact.
   Kaplan said he decided to find Manson's son after a recent series
of news stories marking the 20th anniversary of the Sharon Tate
murders.
   ``Buried in one of the stories was the fact that Manson had a
son,'' Kaplan said. ``That intrigued me and I said, `Let's find
him.' ...
   ``We went back to the clippings and `Helter Skelter' and found
the name Mary Brunner,'' the boy's mother, he said.
   Star determined that the baby was taken back to Mary Brunner's
hometown in the Midwest to live with her parents, who adopted the
boy.
   ``We sent a reporter and the apple simply fell off the tree,''
Kaplan said. ``It took us one day.''
   Brunner agreed to be interviewed on the condition that the
magazine not reveal where he lives, Kaplan said.
   Brunner was 16 months old when Manson's followers murdered
actress Sharon Tate and four others in August 1969, Star says. His
mother, Mary Brunner, was reportedly a member of Manson's so-called
family but was in jail when the murders occurred for trying to use a
stolen credit card.
   `It's been out there all this time,'' Kaplan said. ``The ripples
stayed in this relatively small community and out of the local
newspaper.''

   Police on Friday blew up a suspicious package found
outside the Indonesian Embassy, which is several hundred yards away
from the U.S. Embassy.
   A spokeman for Scotland Yard said it was not known if the package
contained explosives but authorities evacuated the immediate area as
a precaution. Police blew up the parcel where it was found.
   The U.S. Embassy, on an adjoining side of Grosvenor Square, was
not evacuated, said an embassy spokesman.
   The Scotland Yard officer said the package was found at about 2
p.m. and it was blown up an hour later in a controlled explosion.
   ``It was blown up by our bomb squad but that doesn't mean it was
a bomb,'' he said. ``We're awaiting further details.''

<HEAD>Appeals Court Grants New Trial For Man Convicted in Palme Slaying</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An appeals court agreed Friday to a hold
a new trial next month for the man convicted in the slaying of Prime
Minister Olof Palme, the national TT news agency said.
   Christer Pettersson was sentenced to life in prison last month
after his conviction. Pettersson, a 42 year old with a lengthy
criminal record, denied shooting the four-term prime minister and
appealed.
   The prosecution also appealed because it wanted to convict
Pettersson of attempted murder in the wounding of Palme's widow,
Lisbeth, in the attack in February 1986. Pettersson was convicted of
the lesser charge of endangering Mrs. Palme's life.
   In Sweden, reviews by appellate courts are automatic if either
side appeals, but the appellate court has the choice of either
recalling witnesses or simply reviewing the records of the lower
court.
   The makeup of the appeals court differs from the district court,
in that a majority on the jury are professional jurists and a
minority are lay jurors.
   In the district court, the six lay jurors voted to convict
Pettersson and the two judges voted to acquit.
   The new trial will begin Sept. 12 in the Svea Court of Appeals,
the TT news agency said.
   Palme was shot Feb. 28, 1986 while walking home from a movie with
his wife.
   Mrs. Palme claimed she saw Pettersson a few feet away immediately
after her husband was shot.
   Another witness, however, testified he saw Pettersson at a train
station nowhere near the scene of the shooting a short while after
the murder.
   Defense attorney Arne Liljeros said a new witness who did not
testify at the first trial also claims to have seen Pettersson at
the train station.

<HEAD>Torrential Rains Hit Virginia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Torrential thunderstorms hit southeast Virginia on Friday,
dumping up to a foot of rain in just four hours and flooding roads
in Williamsburg and the Hampton Roads area.
   Heavy rain fell in sections of the Virginia and West Virginia
mountains. Thunderstorms or showers also fell in Florida, Louisiana,
Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Minnesota, Idaho and the Rockies.
   Clear skies prevailed over the Great Lakes region and from the
Pacific Northwest to Nevada and California. Skies were partly cloudy
over New England and the upper Mississippi Valley.
   Slow-moving or nearly stationary thunderstorms dumped nearly 11
inches of rain on Williamsburg, and the National Park Service
reported 12 inches at nearby Yorktown Battlefield. Toano, Va., got
six inches.
   In addition to Williamsburg, flooding was reported in Hampton and
Newport News, surrounding York County, and James City County.
   The Norfolk area across the Hampton Roads waterway from York
County missed most of the heavy rain, but Virginia Beach recorded 2
inches of rain in 15 minutes.
   To the west, up to 5 inches of rain fell in mountainous Monroe
County, W.Va., and neighboring Giles County, Va. Flooding closed
many roads in western Giles County.
   A flash flood watch issued for western Maryland, western Virginia
and the eastern panhandle of West Virginia was in effect through
Saturday morning.
   The thunderstorms over eastern and southern Florida produced
nickel-size hail in Ormond Beach. Thunderstorms along the Texas
Coast extended into sections of southern Louisiana. Padre Island,
Texas, got 1 to 3 inches of rain.
   One to 2 inches of rain fell in four hours in sections of central
and east-central Arizona, prompting a flash-flood watch for
east-central Arizona.
   A thunderstorm in southeast Idaho produced half-inch hail in
McCammon and Lava Hot Springs which damaged gardens and field crops.
   It was 59 degrees in Bakersfield, Calif., on Friday morning,
breaking the low-temperature record for the date set in 1949 by 1
degree.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 50
degrees in Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., to 100 degrees in Yuma,
Ariz. The morning low in the Lower 48 states was 33 degrees in
Truckee, Calif.
   The forecast for Saturday called for showers and thunderstorms
widespread from southern New England to the Middle Atlantic States
to the central Appalachians, North Carolina and southern Florida;
widely scattered thunderstorms from the Gulf Coast to the lower
Mississippi Valley, the Great Plains, and the Rockies; and scattered
thunderstorms in Minnesota.
   High temperatures were expected in the 70s along the northern
Atlantic Coast and in the northern and central Appalachians,
northern Minnesota, North Dakota, sections of the Rockies and along
the Pacific Coast; in the 90s from Florida to southern sections of
Georgia and Alabama, the lower Mississippi Valley, the southern
Plains, sections of New Mexico, the inland valleys of California and
southwest Oregon; 100 to 108 degrees in the desert Southwest; and in
the 80s elsewhere.

<HEAD>Politburo Member Confirms Secret Soviet-Nazi Pact, Urges Condemnation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Politburo member Alexander Yakovlev conceded in an
interview published today that there was no doubt that the Soviet
Union and Nazi Germany secretly agreed to divide Eastern Europe.
   Yakovlev, who heads a parliamentary panel charged with finding
the truth about the 1939 Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, is the first
member of the ruling Politburo to reverse decades of Kremlin denials
that secret protocols dividing Poland and the Baltic states existed.
   ``There was, without doubt, a collusion,'' he told the Communist
Party daily. He said the agreements should be ``unequivocally
condemned.''
   The issue is at the heart of a drive by Latvia, Lithuania and
Estonia to gain more independence from the Soviet Union by
challenging the legitimacy of its control over the Baltic region.
   Yakovlev, echoing an approach taken in the past few weeks among
Soviet historians, denied that the secret pact had any bearing on
the Baltic states' current legal status.
   ``It is necessary to admit that neither the treaty nor protocol
determined the legal and political status of Lithuania, Latvia and
Estonia,'' he said. ``It is even more far-fetched to seek some kind
of interrelation between the present status of the three republics
and the non-aggression treaty.''
   ``I believe that we'll be acting responsibly and in a politically
principled way by having unequivocally condemned the pre-war Soviet
leadership's deviation from Leninist principles of foreign policy,
no matter how it is explained,'' he added.
   Soviet history books contend the Baltic republics voluntarily
joined the Soviet Union. The United States subscribes to many Balts'
claims that they were forced into the union by the occupying Red
Army and does not recognize the Baltic annexation.
   The republics plan a series of protests and other events to
commemorate the anniversary of the pact on Wednesday, including a
human chain stretching from Estonia to Lithuania.
   Yakovlev's commission has not issued its formal conclusions, but
members have said publicly the report will say the protocols existed
and condemn them.
   For decades, the Soviet Union denied the existence of the secret
protocols to the non-aggression pact, which was signed by foreign
ministers Joachim Von Ribbentrop and Vyacheslav Molotov one week
before Germany invaded Poland.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told the Congress of People's
Deputies in June that it was difficult to form a conclusion on the
protocols because no one had been able to locate the original
documents.

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Greece will participate in one NATO
military exercise later this year but not another one because of its
dispute with fellow NATO member Turkey, the Athens News Agency
reported Friday.
   The semiofficial agency quoted Defense Ministry sources as saying
Greece would take part in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's
``Deterrent Force'' exercise in the western Mediterranean from Oct.
9-Nov. 14.
   The sources, who were not identified, said Greece will not
participate in the ``Display Determination'' maneuvers in late
September and early October in the eastern Mediterranean, Black Sea
and certain parts of Turkish territory because of the exclusion of
the Greek island of Limnos from the exercise.
   Greece has refused since 1985 to join in any NATO exercises in
the Aegean that excludes Limnos, off Turkey's western coast.
   Turkey claims Limnos has been militarized in violation of a 1922
treaty but Greece claims that treaty was annulled by another treaty
in 1936.
   Other countries scheduled to take part in the ``Deterrent Force''
operation are the United States, Italy and Turkey.

<HEAD>Woman Sentenced for Murder 21 Years Ago</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WAUKEGAN, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who disappeared after being accused
of killing her lover 21 years ago, only to be found earlier this
year, was sentenced Friday to one to three years in prison for
manslaughter.
   ``It's all over now, except for her to do her time,'' Assistant
State's Attorney Joe Collina said after Bernice Van Heise, 63, was
sentenced by Lake County Circuit Judge Harry Hartel Jr.
   Ms. Van Heise will be eligible for parole in nine months, the
Lake County prosecutor's office said.
   Ms. Van Heise, who lived quietly for years as wife and mother
Gretta Knickerbocker, said she had mixed feelings about the guilty
plea she entered last month in the Jan. 31, 1968, shooting death of
Eugene Douglas.
   ``I did it for all my children in their new lives,'' she told
reporters in this county seat nearly 25 miles north of Chicago. ``I
didn't want them dragged through this thing.''
   Prosecutors agreed to drop murder charges in exchange for Ms. Van
Heise's guilty plea.
   ``We didn't pursue murder charges because some of the evidence
was old and some of the memories were beginning to fade,'' Collina
said.
   In 1968, Douglas and Ms. Van Heise had been having an affair for
about a year, prosecutors said. Douglas, a 48-year-old Glenview
artist, was shot when he told his lover he was leaving her to return
to his wife and children, prosecutors said.
   ``She claimed that the shooting was an accident and that she was
handing the gun to Douglas when it discharged and he was shot,''
Assistant State's Attorney Michael Waller said Friday. ``Strangely,
he was shot in the back of the head.''
   Douglas' widow, Pat Douglas, and her two daughters were in court
for the sentencing. ``There's no way that anybody's going to make up
for what happened,'' she said. ``But I'm very happy it's been taken
care of.''
   Shortly after Douglas' death, a judge rejected the filing of a
murder charge on the basis of insufficient evidence.
   A grand jury later indicted Ms. Van Heise on murder charges, but
she had disappeared. The indictment was withdrawn in 1975.
   Investigators took up the case again after a friend of Ms. Van
Hiese's daughter was overheard discussing the case.
   Ms. Van Heise was re-indicted in February after authorities
located her in the rural town of Elburn, about 40 miles west of
Chicago. She and her husband of 20 years, Conrad Knickerbocker, had
moved there in 1976 from the Chicago suburb of Hinsdale.

   A blast at a commercial explosives plant
Friday killed two workers and injured five, officials said.
   The explosion occurred about 4:40 p.m. when the employees poured
molten primer into a 1-pound mold. The solidified primer is used to
ignite blasting agents, said Peter Astrauskas, technical director of
the Atlas Powder Co.
   The company did not identify the victims Friday night pending
notification of their relatives, Astrauskas said. The plant is five
miles east of Joplin.
   Astrauskas said the cause of the explosion would be investigated.
He said there was no fire and little damage to the plant.
   The injured were taken to St. John's Medical Center in Joplin,
where officials refused to disclose their conditions.
   Astrauskas said he knew of no fatal accidents at the plant since
just after World War II. The factory employs about 400 people and
makes explosives of various types, he said.

   A Trans World Airlines MD-80 airliner landed
safely Friday at Lambert St. Louis International Airport after an
engine came apart on takeoff and a two-foot piece of it narrowly
missed a man on the ground.
   ``I heard a large explosion and then I heard a lot of debris
hitting the roof,'' said Mark Erp, 29, manager of an auto body shop
in Kinloch, next to St. Louis' Lambert airport.
   ``Then a big hunk came through the roof and hit the floor about
10 or 15 feet from me,'' he said. ``I had been walking that way.
Needless to say, I just dived away. I didn't know if there was more
coming.''
   Officials said Flight 223 from St. Louis to San Francisco had
just taken off about 10:15 a.m. when passengers heard a loud pop and
the pilot announced that the plane was returning to the airport. The
plane made a routine landing and there were no injuries, said TWA
spokesman Don Morrison.
   Morrison said the flight was canceled, and the 112 passengers
were put on another flight.
   Morrison said the engine was designed to eject loose parts to
minimize problems. ``We understand some pieces fell, and we're
investigating,'' Morrison said.
   Morrison said the engine part that fell was a cone, the rear
cover for one of the plane's Pratt &amp; Whitney engines.
   Fred Farrar, a Federal Aviation Administration spokesman in
Washington, said a piece of cowling that wraps around the engine
apparently came off.
   Farrar said the plane could have been flown safely without the
cowling but that the pilot probably did the right thing by aborting
the flight. ``Given the fact that we have 19,000 flights per day in
this country, we may have one report like this a month,'' Farrar
said.
   Morrison said the plane was being examined to determine the cause
of the engine failure.
   Erp said the engine part that fell into his shop was a metal cone
about 2 feet long that weighed about 15 pounds. He said it ripped a
5-foot-square hole in the roof of the building.
   ``We started to pick it up but it was red hot,'' he said. ``It
was still too hot to touch about 30 minutes later.''
   Erp said TWA officials who reclaimed the debris were at the shop
only briefly. ``They just took the cone and picked up some smaller
pieces and left,'' Erp said. ``They didn't say a whole lot. I guess
they didn't want to talk about it.''

   Nine Laotian children orphaned by the
murder-suicide of their parents following a tense 6{-hour hostage
drama were in the temporary custody of relatives Friday, authorities
said.
   Church and county counselors said they have begun to look for
permanent homes for the youngsters.
   Bao Cha, mother of the children, ages one to 13, was fatally shot
Thursday evening by her husband, Dang Cha Xiong, who then put the
handgun to his own head as eight of their nine children huddled in
another room of their apartment.
   The ninth child, a 12-year-old boy, fled from the apartment
earlier through a window and alerted police that his father was
inside with a handgun, threatening his mother and playing Russian
roulette with the other children.
   None of the children was injured.
   Deputy Police Chief Lucian Neely said Dang, 35, had been
convicted last year of two misdemeanor counts of abuse and cruelty
to his children, and was prohibited under the terms of his probation
from visiting his wife or children.
   Neely said Dang served four months in county jail on the original
cruelty charges, and that he was returned to jail twice since then,
in January and again in June, for violating terms of his probation
by visiting his family.
   Dang had been released from jail on the most recent probation
violation on Monday, and Neely said investigators believe that he
went to his wife's apartment Thursday because he blamed her for his
probation violation arrest.
   ``There's no way I can ever say what the motive was, but the
timing suggests something related to that,'' the deputy chief said
of the probation violations.
   More than 50 officers surrounded the home in a neat apartment
complex populated largely by Asian refugee families near the
University of the Pacific campus. Hostage negotiators talked with
Dang by telephone for several hours.
   Neely said Dang sounded cooperative on the telephone. But after
Dang said he would surrender and lay down his gun, police heard four
shots.
   Officers rushed the apartment and found the children in a front
room and the two wounded parents in a rear bedroom. The mother was
pronounced dead within minutes and the father about two hours later.
   Police did not fire any shots during the siege, Neely said.
   Neely said officers originally believed that several of the
hostages were children of neighbors, but that later interviews with
family members confirmed all nine were Dang's children.
   He said the children spent Thursday night with relatives, and
that county Child Protective Services officers and representatives
of church-related refugee services agencies were jointly taking
responsibility for arranging permanent placement of the children.
   Stockton has a large community of refugees from Southeast Asia
served by several public and volunteer social service agencies.
   Five Stockton children killed last Jan. 17 by a deranged gunman
in a school yard were also refugees from Southeast Asia, as were
most of the 29 children wounded in that attack.
   In a statement Friday, Stockton Mayor Barbara Fass noted that
earlier incident, and the image of her city projected by another
incident involving refugee children.
   ``I think it's the media that's giving the city a bad reputation.
It's a hostage situation, a family feud like that happens,
unfortunately, in every major city in the country,'' Fass said.

   A truck carrying 40,000 rounds of
ammunition for warplanes went up in flames and explosions early
Friday, killing the driver, injuring her husband and closing an
interstate for hours, authorities said.
   The tractor-trailer rig, loaded with 20mm shells for aircraft
cannon, veered off Interstate 17 into a ditch and caught fire in a
remote area about 30 miles north of Phoenix around 1 a.m., officials
said.
   ``The shells kept exploding; it was like fireworks,'' said Rock
Springs Fire Chief Pete Davis. ``There were shells for about 100
yards on either side. You couldn't walk without stepping on one.''
   Although no evacuations were necessary, the sporadic explosions
kept authorities at bay until about 5:30 a.m., Davis said.
   The body of the driver, Lois Bailey, 38, of Coleman, Ala., wasn't
found for hours because of the danger, said State Department of
Public Safety spokesman Allan Schmidt.
   Her 33-year-old husband, Rick, was in serious condition at John
C. Lincoln Hospital in Phoenix, hospital spokeswoman Lisa Boulay
said.
   The backup on I-17, the major link between Phoenix and Flagstaff,
stretched 10 miles and traffic was delayed up to two hours, Schmidt
said. The highway was not fully reopened until all it had been
cleared of shells more than 14 hours after the accident.
   People were kept several hundred yards from the accident scene as
a four-person Army explosives team recovered 400 of an estimated 600
unexploded shells, Schmidt said.
   ``There is no way we could recover everything today,'' he said.
``This armament is spread throughout this area.''
   The truck, hauling the ammunition from Fort Huachuca in Sierra
Vista in southeast Arizona to the Navajo Army Depot near Flagstaff,
apparently was traveling through a storm when it veered left into a
guardrail, Schmidt said.
   Schmidt said it was not known what caused the truck to veer.
``The whole load came forward, crushing the cab,'' Schmidt said.
``Some of the ammunition was thrown. The fire was all-consuming.''
   Bailey, who was sleeping while his wife drove, apparently crawled
several hundred yards across the interstate to the Rock Springs
general store.
   By the time officials were able to approach the truck, all but a
few boxes of the ammunition had exploded, Schmidt said. Spent
casings littered the area.
   The shipment being hauled under a contract with the military
originated in San Antonio, said Lt. Col. Ed Cooke of Kelly Air Force
Base there. The 37,000 pounds of Class D ammunition was taken to
Fort Huachuca from a depot at Lackland Air Force Base operatated by
Kelly, Cooke said.

   Former aides of Lyndon B. Johnson are
planning a 25th anniversary reunion they hope will bring together
U.S. and Vietnamese officials for the first time to discuss the war
that tore the administration apart.
   Organizers also hope next year's gathering to mark President
Johnson's inauguration in January 1965 will be the largest reunion
ever of a presidential administration.
   Sponsored by the Lyndon Baines Johnson Foundation, the events are
scheduled for April 6-7 in Washington, D.C., and May 3-5 in Austin,
said Robert Hardesty, a former Johnson aide.
   Harry Middleton, director of the LBJ Library at the University of
Texas, is chairman of program, which includes a daylong symposium on
the Vietnam War. Former Defense Secretary Robert McNamara will be
invited, said Harry McPherson, chairman of the symposium.
   McPherson, a special counsel to Johnson and today a lawyer in
Washington, also hopes members of the North Vietnamese, Chinese and
Soviet governments will participate.
   He said he is inviting officials of America's adversaries in the
war through journalist and author Stanley Karnow.
   ``These are people who were well-placed in the defense and
foreign ministries of those governments. We would like to know a lot
more of the options our enemy was considering during the war. Having
them join in would offer historians a tremendous opportunity,''
McPherson said.
   Other events will include a speech by former U.S. Rep. Barbara
Jordan and a barbecue at the LBJ Ranch to discuss Johnson's ``Great
Society'' programs, said Hardesty, a speech writer for Johnson and
later president of Southwest Texas State University.
   Johnson, harried by the rising tide of public opinion against the
Vietnam War, chose not to run for a second term. He died in 1973.
   Two events are planned in Washington: an April 6 reunion at the
historic Mayflower Hotel for members of the Johnson administration,
and a program the next day at the National Press Club to discuss
Johnson and his legacy.
   Similar discussions will be conducted May 5 at the LBJ Library in
Austin. From such discussions, the planners expect to produce a
documentary film.

<TEXT>
   China's grand plans for its 40th National Day,
including an impressive military parade, have been scrapped,
official reports said Thursday.
   The celebrations that had been scheduled for Oct. 1 _ marking the
establishment of Communist rule over China in 1949 _ were to have
been the most elaborate in five years.
   Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong said no military parade was planned
this year, apparently to avoid reminding people of the tanks that in
June rolled down the streets of Beijing to crush a popular,
seven-week democracy movement.
   In 1984, Beijing celebrated the 35th anniversary with a full day
of festivities in Tiananmen Square, beginning with a two-hour
military parade that included a 1,200-piece military band, 18
formations of foot soldiers and 24 formations of military equipment
including anti-tank missiles, rocket mine-laying vehicles, and
artillery.
   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping reviewed the troops from an
open-roofed Red Flag limousine and addressed the nation from the
rostrum of Tiananmen's northern gate where Mao Tse-tung had
proclaimed the founding of the People's Republic of China.
   A similar display of pageantry was expected this year, but
leaders apparently feel the mood is not right for such a celebration.
   Martial law, enacted on May 20, remains in effect in Beijing, and
troops armed with assault rifles have guarded the city since the
military crackdown on June 3-4.

<TEXT>
   Colin L. Powell, the black general nominated to
head the Joint Chiefs of Staff, credited his rise Thursday to equal
opportunity in the military that, he said, does not exist in all of
society.
   Citing his own nomination and the choice of a woman as first
captain of the cadet corps at the U.S. Military Academy, Powell told
the National Association of Black Journalists: ``Almost all barriers
have now dropped.''
   It remains for all society, he said, to follow the lead of the
military in providing equal opportunity.
   ``If you look at the armed forces of the United States you see
the kind of opportunity for advancement that regrettably does not
exist in every part of our society, even within your own
profession,'' Powell said.
   It was, he said, ``the kind of opportunity that we have led the
way with and hopefully will eventually spread to all parts of our
society. So that achievement, recognition, should be a function
solely of performance.''
   Powell, 52, formerly national security adviser to President
Reagan, was nominated as the nation's most senior military leader by
President Bush last week. If confirmed by the Senate, he would be
the first black in the job.
   Powell suggested to the journalists' group what he said would
have been the best second paragraph to news stories on his
nomination: ``Gen. Powell's appointment would not have been possible
without the sacrifices of those black soldiers who served this great
nation in war for over 300 years previously.''
   ``The real story is that yes, I climbed. I climbed well, I
climbed hard and I climbed over the cliff,'' he said. ``But always
on the backs, on the contributions of those who went before.
   ``Your challenge and my challenge is to tell our young people
throughout the land, black, white, whatever coloration, that they've
got to prepare themselves. They've got to be ready.
   ``I may have crossed over and climbed the cliff with the help of
many others.'' Powell said. ``But now that we're on top of that
cliff and looking ahead there are still more rivers to cross, and
our young people have to be ready.''

   The operator of a day care center where a
3-year-old girl died after being left alone inside a car on a hot
afternoon was charged Thursday with risk of injury to children.
   Bloomfield Police Chief Anthony Magno said Carrie Allison, 57,
was arrested on a Hartford Superior Court warrant charging her with
the felony, which carries a maximum penalty of up to 10 years in
prison and a $500 fine.
   Allison was charged in the death of Ebony Skinner of East
Windsor, whose body was found Aug. 4 in a parked car outside the day
care center Allison operated from her home
   Temperatures rose into the middle-90s and humidity was high and
all the windows in the car were rolled up, police said.
   The state medical examiner's office said Ebony died of
hyperthermia, a condition in which a person loses the ability to
sweat and thereby control body temperature.
   Police suspect Ebony was left in the car for as long as 3{ hours
after a noontime trip to a shopping center or that she climbed into
the car later in the afternoon. Her body was found about 4 p.m. in
Allison's late model Cadillac by a parent who was coming to pick up
her child.
   Magno said Allison was released on $5,000 bond and is scheduled
to appear in Superior Court in West Hartford on Sept. 5.
   She has not been available for comment since Ebony's death, and
did not return a telephone call left on her answering machine
Thursday.
   Ebony's death was the first fatality recorded in the 38 years the
state has been regulating family day care, said Donna Jolly,
spokeswoman for the Department of Human Resources.
   The day after the girl died, the department revoked Allison's
registration as a ``family day care home.''

<HEAD>Girl in Lukens Case Ordered Held in Custody</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A teen-ager who had accused U.S. Rep.
Donald Lukens of having sex with her was ordered held in custody
Thursday on two charges filed by her mother.
   Franklin County Juvenile Court referee Jeff Liston ruled that
Rosie Coffman is out of control and that he would hold her until
trial.
   A trial date was not set, but it is to be held within 10 days.
   Ms. Coffman, 17, was arrested Wednesday and charged with criminal
damaging and menacing, based on complaints filed by her mother, Anna
Coffman, of Columbus.
   The referee's decision was made after Rosie Coffman's first court
appearance on the charges.
   Rosie Coffman's allegations against Lukens led to his May 26
conviction and subsequent sentencing on a misdemeanor charge of
contributing to the unruliness of a minor. The 58-year-old
Republican was sentenced to 30 days in jail and fined $500 by
Franklin County Domestic Relations Court Judge Ronald Solove.
   The aggravated menacing charge stemmed from a July 27 incident in
which Rosie Coffman allegedly threatened to hit her mother with a
telephone. According to testimony, Rosie would not get off the phone
when asked by her mother.
   The criminal damaging charge resulted from an incident on Aug. 13
at the Coffman residence. According to testimony, Rosie Coffman
tried to pry open a door to the house after she was locked out.
   Rosie Coffman was being held in the county's juvenile detention
center.
   The girl and her mother were key figures in Lukens' trial.
   Rosie Coffman claimed she was paid by Lukens to have sex with him
at his Columbus apartment last November, when she was 16. She said
Lukens knew she was underage at the time.
   Anna Coffman's complaint to Columbus television station WSYX late
last year led to an investigation that resulted in Lukens'
indictment in February.
   She testified that during a meeting with Lukens at a fast-food
restaurant in November, Lukens offered to find her a government job
after she confronted him with accusations that he had sex with her
daughter.
   The meeting was secretly videotaped by the television station.
   Mrs. Coffman was jailed in June for a probation violation
stemming from a 1983 drunken driving conviction. She was released to
serve the rest of her 2{-month sentence at her home, where her
movement is monitored by an electronic band attached to her ankle.

   For the third time this year, scientists
discovered an asteroid will fly relatively close to Earth, and while
there is no threat of collision, experts say such a disaster is
likely sometime in the future.
   ``While the new asteroid poses no immediate danger, in
astronomical terms it will be making a very close pass'' when it
comes within 2{ million miles of Earth about 8 p.m. PDT next
Thursday night, said planetary scientist Eleanor Helin, who
discovered the mile-wide hunk of rock.
   At 2{ million miles _ about 10 times the distance between the
Earth and the moon _ the asteroid designated 1989 PB ``will be one
of the very closest larger objects to pass the Earth this century,''
said Helin, a planetary scientist at the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.
   ``It's not going to hit us. Certainly there's no danger,''
astronomer Brian Marsden said by telephone from Cambridge, Mass.,
where he directs the International Astronomical Union's Central

the figure, estimating institutions hold the remains of 100,000 to

   There are certainly enough crass, venal
motivations at the networks to go around. But to hear some of the
makers of TV movies talk, there are some loftier goals as well.
   Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward are allowing a made-for-TV
production for ABC of their book ``The Final Days,'' in hopes of
reminding people about the constitutional crisis and the personal
drama behind Watergate. So maybe they'll make a few bucks, too.
   Prosecutor Joe Hynes, who reaped a lovely free ticket to Los
Angeles to sit in a hot room with a lot of TV critics, is
cooperating on NBC's ``Howard Beach: Making the Case for Murder.''
He hopes it will enlighten the public about the much-publicized case
of a vicious New York racial attack.
   Elaine Shannon is cooperating with the NBC movie ``Drug Wars: The
Kiki Camarena Story,'' based on her book, ``Desperados: Latin Drug
Lords, U.S. Lawmen, and The War America Can't Win,'' in hopes it
will inspire the public to demand that the government get serious
about the drug problem.
   ABC is also making a movie about the Challenger disaster, Rock
Hudson's battle against AIDS, a Florida child molestation case and
the so-called ``preppy murder,'' a New York sex-and-death case that
made headlines for months.
   ``There's no question these ripped-from-the-news stories make it
a lot easier for television programmers to go out and market a film.
The audience has heard about them,'' said Allen Sabinson, ABC's vice
president for motion pictures for television and miniseries. ``And
there's no question we have some predilection to do them and do a
lot of them. The question that we're sitting and asking is, is there
a reason to do it that goes beyond simply getting a (rating)
number?''
   Some of the movies are made without the permission of the
real-life participants, but are based on material in the public
domain, such as news accounts or trial transcripts.
   Sabinson said ``Unspeakable Acts,'' about the molestation of tots
at a Florida day-care center, will serve the purpose of teaching the
public the warning signs of child abuse. ``Challenger,'' about the
space shuttle explosion, aims to educate audiences on the risks of
technological achievement. ``The Preppy Murder'' will try to reveal
the anguish of the victim's family, not just because of the crime,
but because of the ensuing publicity. Whether the family will
welcome even more publicity in the form of the TV movie remains to
be seen.
   Ken Kaufman, the producer of ``Howard Beach,'' said he hopes the
film will present the facts of the case accurately and let the
public draw from it what they will.
   Daniel J. Travanti portrays Hynes in the movie about the
successful prosecution of a group of white youths charged with
attacking a group of blacks and chasing one of them to his death on
a highway.
   ``If it saves the life, or if it saves the trauma of one single
family,'' Hynes said, ``it's worth it.''
   ``Drug Wars'' is a real-life tale produced by Michael Mann, whose
``Miami Vice'' was a stylized, fictional homage to drug-fighting
cops. Shannon, a journalist whose investigative book is an angry
account of America's anti-drug policies and their effect on the
agents in the field, said she was impressed by the authenticity of
the movie, directed by Brian Gibson.
   ``There are anecdotes that are compressed in time. You have to do
that in order to get it intelligible for television, but I am very
satisfied that the spirit of the story is there, and it's real,''
she said.
   Mann said the movie will not depict the torture and murder of
Camarena, a Guadalajara-based Drug Enforcement Administration agent
killed by traffickers. ``I would never put that scene in,'' he said.
``It would be too strong. It's not to the point. What is to the
point is the people's reactions to the fact of it.''
   Bernstein attended a news conference with the makers of the
three-hour ``Final Days.'' He said he would have preferred that the
book be made into the stage play, but praised the TV movie, in which
Lane Smith plays Richard Nixon.
   ``I feel strongly, you know, that we need to know about what
happened in this epoch of our history, and what this president
did,'' Bernstein said. ``A lot of people in this country don't know
about it, or they've forgotten about it.''

   MATT GROENING _ Cartoonist Matt Groening, whose ``The Simpsons''
will spin off Fox's ``The Tracey Ullman Show'' to their own animated
sitcom sometime this season, might have been writing blurbs about
shows instead of the shows themselves. ``I actually applied for a
job at TV Guide to write plot summaries of shows,'' he said. ``I was
very serious in those days. They gave me a script of `Rhoda,' I
think, and I wrote a blurb.'' He did not get the job. ``They said,
`I'm sorry, you cannot use the word `mise en scene' in TV Guide.'''

   If you take the long-term view of investing, the
1990s should be profitable for you.
   If, for instance, you invested $1,000 in a good growth stock and
reinvested the dividends immediately you might expect your
investment to grow to more than $2,500 by the end of the decade.
   High-cost financial advisers and portfolio managers might brag
about that result, but it is well within the ability of most
ordinary investors, and it need not involve an inordinate amount of
risk.
   For your $1,000 to reach that figure would involve a return of
about 11 percent a year, a rate that might not seem very high in
these days of instant wealth. Compounding, however, works wonders,
but compounding takes time.
   While any investment involves the risk of loss, many conservative
investors will do much better than that. Over the longer term, such
as a full decade, the percentages are strongly in favor of equity
investments.
   Had you invested $1,000 back in 1974, and left it there along
with all the dividends it earned, you might have had more than
$5,500 by the end of 1988. Extraordinary? No. That was just normal.
   In fact, during that time the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index
rose by the very percentage that generated the 5{-fold increase. If
you had done only as well as the market, rather than having beaten
it, you would have had $5,622.
   That sum was achieved at an annual rate of 12 percent a year.
   Wright Investors' Service, a Bridgeport, Conn., adviser and
portfolio manager that endorses conservative, patient, long-term
investing, foresees the probability of investors earning around 11
percent in the next five years.
   While history alone might support such an expectation, Wright
reasons from the present. This is how it arrives at the figure.
   Based on the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index, corporate
earnings growth should be at a 5 percent to 6 percent compound
annual rate of growth. The average dividend yield is likely to be
between 3.5 percent and 4 percent.
   These two factors produce a 9 percent rate of earned return, but
economic conditions could add another 2 percent annual appreciation
via increases in price-earnings ratios, or the number of times
earnings at which stocks sell.
   Wright's forecast was made earlier this year, but the rationale
still applies. The basis for its higher P-E multiples is an
expectation of declining interest rates. That, it figures, justifies
a P-E of 12 to 13.
   In other words, the market over the next five years is expected
to roughly equal its long-term performance. Said Wright: ``Investors
accustomed to the high returns typical since 1982 will have to scale
back their expectations.''
   Scale back their expectations? Yes, in order to raise
expectations about their returns. As long-term investors know,
scaling back long-term expectations to 11 percent means more money
in the bank than scaling up short-term dreams.
   Based on the past, the norm isn't bad. It can raise your
investment to 2.5 times its original value in less than a decade.
Acting with prudence, many investors can do better than the norm,
and some will do very much better.
   While the past is a guide, nobody can say with certainty what the
1990s will mean for investors. The character of decades has been one
of uniqueness rather than similarity, and the 1990s are likely to
follow in that pattern.
   Way back, says Wright, it was the Roaring Twenties, followed by
the Threadbare Thirties. Then came the Fighting Forties.
   We sailed through the Fabulous Fifties, built dreams in the
Speculative Sixties, and paid for our excesses in the Stagnant
Seventies. And the 1980s? We're still trying to figure them out;
they're the Enigmatic Eighties.
   Long-term investors are now trying to get the measure of the
1990s. They cannot see to the end of the decade, but as the
beginning nears they are hoping for normalcy. They want it to be the
Normal Nineties. Normal will do.

<HEAD>Pacific Island Cultists Await Return of Americans from Sky</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TANNA, Vanuatu (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Each morning the men of Jon Frum Village,
at the foot of the smoking and rumbling Yasur volcano, raise the
American flag and pray the Americans to come back to this primitive
South Pacific island.
   In a hut beside the flag pole is a crudely lettered board
declaring it to be Jon Frum Custom Movement Headquarters.
   ``We believe the Americans will come and bring us cargo,'' said
Jonas Malman, a villager.
   ``Jon Frum is a spirit, he will bring the cargo.''
   The islanders say Jon Frum is a spirit who appeared as an
American soldier in World War II and handed out supplies to the
people of Tanna, one of the chain of islands that make up Vanuatu.
No trace of a Jon Frum has been found in U.S. military records.
   The villagers live in grass huts, have no electricity or running
water and few posessions. But they have never forgotten the
Americans in World War II and the fabulous cargoes of clothing,
vehicles, soft drinks, gum, candy, cigarettes and canned food they
brought with them on their way to fight the Japanese.
   The people of Jon Frum Village and thousands more on this densely
jungled island of 17,000 Melanesians believe if they can find the
right magic the Americans will return and bestow them with wealth,
meaning cargo.
   The Jon Frum movement is one of several so-called cargo cults
that exist in Melanesia, a group of islands stetching from New
Guinea to New Caledonia.
   They believe the cargo they see arriving by ship and plane was
sent to them by their ancestors. But white man's magic has kept them
from getting it.
   Cults like the Jon Frum Society are always on the lookout for
help from a powerful man who may have strong magic.
   One cult on Tanna worships the Duke of Edinburgh, the husband of
Queen Elizabeth II, and believes he originally came from Tanna. They
think he has the power to help get them cargo.
   In New Guinea, a cult sought to buy President Lyndon B. Johnson
because they had been told he was the most powerful man in the
world. Since his name was on all the Johnson outboard motors they
used on their canoes, they saw little reason to doubt the claim.
   The Jon Frum movement is one of the oldest of Vanuatu's cargo
cults. Its origins are obscure. Some anthropologists say it may
actually date back to the 1930s and could have arisen as a reaction
to missionary efforts to abolish traditonal customs such as polygamy
and drinking kava, a potent local brew.
   The movement got a powerful boost during World War II when many
Tannese were sent to other islands to work for the Americans who
used the islands, then called New Hebrides, as a staging base in
their Pacific campaign.
   When the Tannese saw black American soldiers handling cargo and
getting food and supplies like the white man they were impressed by
their magic.
   At this time, according to studies of the cult, the Tannese
believe Jon Frum reappeared as a black medical corpsman.
   The movement adopted the Red Cross as their insigna. They planted
dozens of wooden red crosses at the foot of their volcano in the
hope this would encourage the return of Jon Frum and the cargo.
   After the Americans moved on, a Tannese declared himself king of
America and built a crude airstrip in the jungle with a bamboo
replica of a control tower and ``radios'' made of tin cans and
string hoping to attract planes to land, as they had seen them land
at U.S. air bases.
   Others built copies of refrigerators, opening the doors several
times a day hoping to find cold beer the way they Amercians had done.
   The British and French who jointly governed the New Hebrides
until 1980 outlawed the cult and frequently jailed its leaders.
   The national government that followed also curbed its activities.
   But the Jon Frum movement continues to flourish on this dark,
rugged island dominated by the smoking 900-foot volcano, whose ash
is slowly choking large areas of once-productive coconut plantation
around the village.
   Friday is the cult's sabbath and followers meet at Sulphur Bay.
They dance and drink kava on Saturday night. By Sunday they are too
tired to go to the missonary church.
   Jon Frum's followers expect him to return each Feb. 15, but they
don't know which year and they don't get despondent when he doesn't
appear.
   Chief Isaac Wan, headman of the Jon Frum village, tells visitors
that Christians waited a long time for the Redeemer.

<HEAD>Actress Maryam D'Abo Sinks Teeth Into Vampire Role</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>

   Maryam d'Abo winged here in the dead of night
to talk about her role as a vampire in a new movie for USA Network.
   Her flight, during a break in filming a miniseries in England,
was by jet.
   Her character Angelique in ``Nightlife'' is too much of a
reluctant vampire to spread her wings, even for a Transylvania
transfusion.
   In the movie, which debuts on Wednesday, she's hiding out from an
amatory vampire named Vlad, played by Ben Cross.
   ``She's trying to escape not only from Vlad but from being a
vampire,'' said d'Abo. ``It's offbeat. Usually, vampires enjoy being
vampires. She wants to get rid of it if she can.''
   ``Nightlife'' is strictly fang in cheek. Although it's not as
broad as ``Love at First Bite'' it's closer to that than to
``Dracula.''
   Angelique lives in a condo with a maid so ditsy she doesn't
notice her boss sleeps in a coffin.
   It opens with Angelique arising from a sleep of 100 years when
her grave in Mexico City is dug up. She collapses and is rushed to
the nearest blood bank for a pick-me-up. The doctor in charge,
played by Keith Szarabajka, believes she is suffering from a rare
blood disorder. They fall in love and Vlad's wrath turns into a
blood feud.
   The movie looks at how modern medicine would view a vampire,
which would be as a disease. And how an ancient vampire would look
at modern medicine, which would be with contempt.
   D'Abo took a week out from her leading role in the USA Network
miniseries ``Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less'' to come here to
promote the comedy thriller. In 1987 she co-starred in ``The Living
Daylights'' with Timothy Dalton, making his first film as James Bond.
   While in Los Angeles, the British actress lives with her cousin,
Olivia d'Abo of ``The Wonder Years.''
   Maryam was last seen here as an alien from another planet in the
NBC miniseries ``Something Is Out There'' and its spinoff series of
the same name. Joe Cortese also starred as an earthbound policeman.
   ``The problem was that the series just couldn't find its style,''
she said. ``Joe and I were hoping it would follow the comedy style
of the miniseries. But there's always a fear you're not entertaining
the audience if you don't have a lot of action. It's a way of
playing it safe. I believe in stories first. I know now the hardest
writing is series writing. There's no time.''
   ``Not a Penny More'' is a two-part, four-hour miniseries based on
the novel by Jeffrey Archer. A corrupt financier played by Ed Asner
swindles four innocent investors, who devise a scheme to recover
their money. D'Abo plays Asner's daughter, who disapproves of her
father's financial dealings and is romantically involved with one of
his victims. The filming will continue until October.
   D'Abo was born in London to a British father and a Russian
mother. The name is Finnish; her father's ancestors reached England
more than 600 years ago, quite probably in a Viking longboat.
   After her parents' divorce, she was brought up in Paris and
Geneva, where her first language was French. Her mother was the head
of UNICEF greeting cards in Europe.
   ``I started acting in amateur high school productions,'' she
said. ``I wanted to be an artist, however, and attended the London
College of Printing. It was too technical and I switched to the
Drama Centre in London. We called it the Trauma Centre.''
   Soon after getting her union card, which enabled her to work
professionally, she left the school. Her first role was in the CBS
miniseries ``Master of the Game.'' She played Dominique, an artists'
model hired by Dyan Cannon to influence her son to give up his
ambitions of becoming a painter. Harry Hamlin played Cannon's son.
   ``Hopefully in 20 years, when I can consider myself a respected
actress, I'll go back to being an artist,'' she said. ``It's a very
soothing hobby. In the meantime, I just do sketches and
caricatures.''

   MONEY, NOT APPLAUSE _ In the beginning documentary producer Karen
Goodman went looking for street performers. In the end, they came
looking for her. In all, she found 101 street performers for ``No
Applause, Just Throw Money,'' which will be telecast Tuesday night
on PBS' ``P.O.V.'' It's a kaleidoscopic pastiche of entertainers
without interviews, narration or voice-overs. The half-hour film,
made with a grant from the American Film Institute, has won numerous
awards, including the U.S.S.R.'s Silver Prize in Leningrad.

<TEXT>
   The National Transportation Safety Board, now
in its second year under an acting director, is struggling to cope
with a shrinking investigtive staff and a tight budget as it tries
to learn the causes of the nation's worst air, sea and ground
accidents.
   Four congressmen say the situation is worsening and recently
wrote President Bush, asking him to nominate a director as a first
step in rebuilding morale and retaining the agency's reputation as a
leading safety advocate.
   More pointedly, a top NTSB official has complained that his
investigative staff may dwindle so much by year's end that the
agency will have to curtail by one-third the 3,000 or so accident
investigtions it undertakes each year.
   ``The bureau's situation is critical and worsening,'' wrote the
official, Herbert Banks, the NTSB's field operations director.
   Criticism of the agency's actions _ or lack of them _ also comes
from former employees, who charge that the acting chairman, James
Kolstad, is afraid to make waves within the government or in the
industries his agencies is supposed to watch over.
   Kolstad has been acting director since Aug. 14, 1988, after Jim
Burnett failed to win senatorial approval for a fourth two-year term
as chairman.
   Burnett, who had acquired a reputation as a strong, independent
safety advocate, is widely believe to have angered Sen. Wendell
Ford, D-Ky. and the chairman of the Senate aviation subcommittee,
with a speech blasting Ford's proposal to separate the Federal
Aviation Administration from the Transportation Department.
   Burnett's renomination languished without the Senate even holding
a hearing into the matter.
   Since then, Kolstad has become the target of criticism that he
has not dealt with morale problems, has not pushed for increases in
the NTSB's $25.4 million budget, and has not stopped the outflow of
investigators.
   Recently, four ranking members of the House Space, Science and
Technology Committee told Bush that he should nominate a chairman.
   ``We believe that continued uncertainty may have a detrimental
effect on the activities of the board and its respected leadership
role in transportation safety,'' said the letter. The congressmen
said low morale ``could lead to the loss of valuable expertise and
experience.''
   It was signed by Rep. Robert Roe, D-N.J., the committee's
chairman; Rep. Robert Walker of Pennsylvania, the ranking
Republican; Rep. Tim Valentine, D-S.C., chairman of the panel's
transportation subcommittee; and Rep. Tom Lewis, R-Fla., the
subcommittee's ranking GOP member.
   For his part, Kolstad said in an interview that he believes
morale is better than it was when he took over. But he added:
   ``There is a concern that we have people in an acting capacity,
because it suggests that a lot of change that might otherwise occur
can't occur. There is frustration among some staff people. It's in
everyone's interest that the matter be resolved.''
   Burnett's supporters, speaking anonymously, maintain that while
Bush may favor Burnett, a longtime political supporter and campaign
activist for Bush in Arkansas, some White House advisers dislike
Burnett's outspokeness on safety issues.
   These sources maintain that there has been extensive industry
lobbying to keep Kolstad, a former public relations vice president
for Frontier Airlines, as chairman.
   As for the future of the board's investigations, Banks, the field
operations director, projected in a May 11 memo that six more
investigators would quit by the end of the year, making the NTSB to
unable to live up to its congressional mandate to investigate all
airplane crashes.
   His memo, forecasting that the agency would have to cut the
number of accidents it investigates a year by 900, never made it to
the board. It was sent back by the board's staff director, Lloyd
Miller, preventing the issue from being debated by the board and,
perhaps, being aired at a public hearing.
   Miller, like Kolstad, disagreed with the severity of Banks'
assessment and thought the situation not serious enough to be put
before the board. Banks declined to discuss the memo with a reporter.
   For his part, Kolstad discounted Bank's concerns as ``overly
pessimistic'' and said no major investigations or critical safety
problems would be affected at the NTSB, which examines airplane
crashes, sea disasters, major highway accidents and pipeline breaks.
   ``There has been a cutback'' in investigations, Kolstad said.
``But, frankly, we've got fewer accidents; the accident rate is
improving. That doesn't suggest we have enough people to investigate
the accidents that exist, because we don't, but I think we're doing
a better job on the ones that we are investigating.''
   Major investigations now under way include two recent incidents
involving explosive engine failures in DC-10s, other airliner
accidents, oil spills in Alaska and elsewhere, and several freight
train derailments.
   Over the last decade, the NTSB's staff has been reduced from more
than 400 to 324, with many key investigators leaving for
higher-paying, private jobs.
   Some NTSB staff members praise Kolstad as personable and
competent. Private air safety consultant Charles Miller, once the
NTSB's director of accident investigtions, describes the acting
chairman as a ``fine individual'' who recognizes his limitations.
   Others once associated with the agency have a different opinion.
   ``Kolstad is a caretaker who doesn't take care of the board,''
said former NTSB public affairs director Ira J. Furman, a Woodmere,
N.Y., lawyer who stays close to transportation safety issues and
still visits accident sites as a media consultant.
   Furman, who left the board in 1987, when Burnett was chairman,
said Kolstad has failed to push hard within the Bush administration
for a bigger agency budget.
   J. Peter Kissinger, who resigned from the agency's staff last
week after being shifted from managing director of the staff to a
job with considerably less responsibility, said Kolstad ``doesn't
want to rock the boat.''
   While the NTSB has no regulatory power of its own, it is the
government's primary accident investigation agency and makes
recommendations to Congress, other agencies and transportation
industries.
   Burnett and Kolstad have sharply different styles and are often
at odds on safety issues. The former chairman is sometimes the only
dissenter on the board; the acting chairman has been low key, rarely
taking strong positions in open meetings.
   Critics of the NTSB cite several incidents as evidence of
problems:
   _The board failed to investigate the complaint this spring of 60
air traffic controllers in Cleveland who signed a petition citing
high-altitude ``air traffic chaos'' and calling for steps to
alleviate the ``hazardous environment.''
   Lloyd Miller, the acting managing director, headed off the
petition before it reached the board, contending it would be a bad
precedent to investigate what might be a labor-management problem.
   _Kolstad was the board member assigned to the Exxon Valdez oil
spill but did not go to Alaska to head the investigation.
   Kolstad answered that charge be saying that he has been very
active in the inquiry and that he decided not to go because other
high government officials were going and he did not see the need for
``sending another big name to the scene.''
   _While imposing a hiring freeze to meet its budget, the board
held a meeting for top personnel in Miami and the acting chairman
made two official trips to Europe.
   Kolstad said that the Miami meeting provided important dialogue
with industry representatives and that the board had gotten ``a good
deal'' on hotel accommodations and other expenses. He said both
European trips were worthwhile and part of his official duties.

   Bob Hall was a rebel without a car.
   Hall longed for a stylish, affordable convertible that would
recapture the sheer driving fun offered by British sports cars of
the past. One, he says, with a ``soul.''
   But Britain wasn't making them anymore. Detroit wouldn't. It
seemed unlikely that Hall's bosses at Mazda, the Japanese automaker,
would take a gamble on such a car.
   Hall's dream machine, however, came true: the Mazda MX5 Miata.
The two-seat ragtop with smooth-flowing lines is drawing raves from
car critics and eager customers willing to pay thousands over its
list price.
   ``I am not suprised that it has gone over very well. I am
surprised by the intensity of the reaction,'' Hall said.
   He explains its impact in emotional terms: ``It's a feeling car.
It feels like it's doing everything correctly. It works on your
soul, maybe because it has a soul.''
   Hall, 36, Mazda's product planning manager here, and assistant
chief designer Mark Jordan, 35, have both been pulled over by police
while taking early spins in the peppy Miata _ but only for reviews.
   ``How do you like the car?'' an officer shouted to Jordan after
drawing alongside. ``I've got one on order.''
   Hall credits similar enthusiasm among his Mazda colleagues in
Japan and America with helping to persuade company management to
build the car.
   It was in the late 1970s, while Hall was working as a writer for
an auto publication, that he first suggested to a Mazda executive
that the firm consider making an affordable sports car similar to a
Triumph or an Austin-Healy.
   ``I was raised in these quality bits of British workmanship. My
father owned a bunch of sports cars, and he would throw us in the
back seat. I remember the wind blasting through my hair,'' said Hall.
   He was hired in 1981 at Mazda's North American research and
development facility in Irvine, 40 miles south of downtown Los
Angeles, and started lobbying from within.
   ``Anytime anyone would come from Japan, I would get on the
soapbox and talk to them about it,'' said Hall.
   Mazda executives gradually came around, Hall said. Backing the
decision was research material compiled by colleague Jim Kilbourne
showing that an American and international market existed for a
two-seater.
   Hall and Jordan say they wanted to produce a car that combined
British style and driving allure with Japanese reliability and value.
   But, they say, they knew there had to to be something more
intangible.
   ``It's not just a car people are buying. They're buying a
philosophy, a little emotional statement,'' Hall said.
   ``The car has to be a kick-in-the-stomach car; a
people-will-either-hate-it-or-love-it car. You don't make anything
that's really worthwhile if you make it so everybody likes it.''
   Hall said he thinks that's why the Miata, despite its instant
appeal to Americans, didn't roll off an American assembly line.
   ``Detroit is in Detroit, and therein lies the problem,'' he said.
He recalled a conversation in which the chairman of one of the big
three automakers, whom he wouldn't identify, asked him, `` `When are
people in California going to wise up and stop buying funny little
cars?' ''
   ``A lot of decisionmakers have the feeling that if the market
isn't buying what they're making, the market is wrong,'' Hall said.
   He and Jordan, who both have relatives working as auto designers
in Detroit, say they know the idea has been proposed there, thus far
without success.
   Toshiko Hirai, the Miata project manager in Japan, ``made sure
the car got through with the purity that we had on paper. And that's
so seldom how the auto industry works,'' Jordan said.
   The designers and engineers in Japan even recorded and analyzed
the sound of 200 sports car exhaust systems to get just the right
pitch for the car, he said.
   All that fervor, Hall says, has produced a treat for drivers _
and for him.
   ``People appreciate it. That's my payback; seeing all the gents
and the cute-looking girls out for a spin.''

<HEAD>Napalmed Vietnamese Girl Reunited With Her Pulitzer-Winning Photographer</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhotos LA1,2,3 of Aug. 17</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAVANA, Cuba (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The napalmed Vietnamese girl in the Pulitzer
Prize-winning picture that came to symbolize the atrocity of war is
planning a trip to America with a message of reconciliation and hope.
   Phan Thi Kim Phuc was a terrified 9-year-old running from her
napalmed South Vietnam village one June day in 1972 when Associated
Press photographer Nick Ut captured her moment of agony for the ages.
   The gripping picture appeared on newspaper front pages
nationwide, enshrining Kim as a personification of Vietnamese
suffering, and ravaging the American conscience.
   Unseen in the photograph were the ghastly burns. ``Her whole back
and neck and arm were black like barbecue,'' Ut recalls.
   ``There was terrible heat. I was running, running, running away.
I tore off my burning clothes. But the burning didn't stop. I was
alone with that terrible heat,'' Kim told Los Angeles Times Magazine
writer Judith Coburn on the eve of a scheduled six-week trip across
America.
   Kim and Ut met again on July 24, their first meeting in 17 years,
during a brief reunion in Havana.
   ``To me, she's part of the family,'' said Ut, whose famous
picture hangs in the den of his suburban Los Angeles home. ``I tell
my children Bettina and Michael, who were born in America, how lucky
they are to escape war.''
   Ut fled Vietnam in April 1975 and worked two years in the AP's
Tokyo bureau before transferring to the Los Angeles office, where he
continues to work as a staff photographer.
   The Havana reunion was a shock for Ut. The wounded child he
photographed and took to a hospital in 1972 had grown into a
beautiful woman, the scars on her back, chest and arm concealed
beneath a T-shirt.
   Kim accepted a Vietnamese government invitation to go to Cuba in
1986, where she eventually began studies in pharmacology. She now
lives in a student apartment within a Havana highrise.
   ``I want to live my life, marry, have children,'' she said,
adding she's ``a joyful young woman.''
   Her U.S. visit, tentatively set for this fall, will attempt to
soothe lingering bitterness from the bloody Southeast Asian conflict
of two decades ago.
   ``If I ever see those (South Vietnamese) pilots who dropped the
bombs on me, or any American pilots, I would say to them, `The war
is over.' The past is the past,'' she said. ``I would ask those
pilots what can they do to bring us all together.
   ``There's such a connection between Vietnam and America, but it
would be one of friendship. Not bitterness. Not enemies. But I'm not
coming to America to talk about the war.
   ``I'm coming so Americans can meet the girl in the photo ...''
   The 26-year-old woman also wants to see the Statue of Liberty and
the Golden Gate bridge.
   ``If she can forgive, why can't anyone?'' asks Merle Ratner of
the Committee to Welcome Kim Phuc, which is sponsoring her trip. The
visit is part of a campaign to normalize U.S.-Vietnamese relations.
   The photograph led Gen. William Westmoreland, commander in chief
of U.S. forces in Vietnam, to charge Ut's picture was a fake. The
general said Kim had been burned in ``a Hibachi accident.''
   Ut said he had traveled with other journalists to the village of
Trang Bang following three days of heavy fighting. The napalm that
routed Kim and other villagers fell in the early afternoon. As she
ran, the girl cried that her flesh was ``burning so hot,'' said Ut.
   Kim hopes the trip will raise money for her family in Vietnam and
for her return to the United States to study and get medical
treatment.
   Holding her scarred arm next to the untouched one, she asks:
``Don't you think the doctors in America could make them both look
the same?''

   The U.S. trade deficit shrank to $8.17 billion
in June, the smallest monthly imbalance since December 1984, the
government said.
   The Commerce Department said Thursday the June deficit showed a
dramatic 18.9 percent narrowing from a revised May figure of $10.08
billion, reflecting record U.S. export sales and a drop in imports.
   The June report, which was significantly better than had been
expected, was hailed by the Bush administration as evidence that
American manufacturers were enjoying continued success in
penetrating foreign markets.

a sign the strike could end within days. But the company was still
negotiating with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.
   Three other regional Bell companies also are being struck by the

   Ending a controversial chapter in the
government's insider trading probe, prosecutors have decided not to
lodge charges against two Wall Street executives arrested in 1987
while a third agreed to a guilty plea.
   U.S. Attorney Benito Romano made the announcement Thursday after
a top trader at Goldman Sachs &amp; Co., Robert M. Freeman, said he
would plead guilty to mail fraud as part of an agreement with
prosecutors.
   ``In hindsight, we would have been better advised not to proceed
with the arrests at such an early stage of the investigation,''
Romano said.
   The charges initially were brought by then-U.S. Attorney Rudolph
Giuliani and frequently have been cited as an example of overzealous
white-collar prosecution by Giuliani, now a candidate for New York
City mayor.
   Freeman was arrested with Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. trader Richard
Wigton and ex-Kidder trader Timothy Tabor in February 1987, an
indirect result of the Ivan Boesky insider trading scandal that
shook Wall Street three months earlier.
   Freeman and Wigton were seized in their offices as stunned
colleagues watched. Wigton was led away in handcuffs.
   The government voluntarily dropped the initial charges against
the trio in May 1987 after a judge rejected requests by prosecutors
for more pretrial preparation time. The U.S. Attorney's office
indicated at the time that it planned another indictment, but new
charges were not brought.
   Romano told a news conference Thursday the government had closed
its investigation of Wigton and Tabor without bringing any charges.
   ``It's about time they did,'' said Wigton's attorney, Stanley S.
Arkin. ``They wrongly and unjustly arrested the man and charged him
and left him in a state of uncertainty for two years. ... The
government ought to apologize to him.''
   A statement released by Tabor's attorney, Andrew M. Lawler,
called Tabor's arrest ``a terrible misjudgment.''
   ``That decision has caused Mr. Tabor incalculable personal and
professional damage,'' he said. ``A thorough investigation would
have established, and indeed has established, that Mr. Tabor is
innocent of any wrongdoing.''
   Freeman, 47, who also resigned as head of Goldman Sachs'
arbitrage operation, said he decided to plea to end the ordeal of a
criminal investigation that began 2{ years ago.
   ``Life has become a nightmare for me and my family,'' Freeman
told the firm in a letter. ``I have been unable to participate in
the firm's activities in a meaningful way.''
   At an appearance before U.S. Magistrate Nina Gershon, Freeman
said he had agreed to plead guilty to one count of mail fraud in
connection with trades involving the stock of Beatrice Companies
Inc. in early January 1986.
   He is to formally enter his plea Sept. 5 before Judge Pierre
Leval.
   The felony carries a maximum prison term of five years and
prosecutors are seeking $1.86 million in fines.
   The plea agreement caps a criminal investigation of Freeman's
activities with Kidder and several other investment firms. Romano
said Freeman probably will face civil charges filed by the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Romano also said that under the plea agreement, Freeman is not
required to cooperate in the government's investigation of Wall
Street corruption. He would not comment on whether prosecutors were
seeking information from Freeman.
   Freeman was implicated by former Kidder takeover strategist
Martin Siegel, who had been fingered by Boesky as using illegal
insider information for stock trades.
   Freeman said he only knew Siegel through business telephone
conversations. ``I never talked with Siegel with the idea of
influencing any trading decisions by him,'' he said in his letter.
   ``The conversation with him ... regarding Beatrice certainly took
place, and I should not have initiated trading after it,'' he said.
   As head of arbitrage, the speculative buying and selling of
stock, Freeman said he invested heavily in Beatrice stock _ for
Goldman Sachs as well as his personal account _ based on his
confidence that Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.'s debt-financed
takeover of Beatrice would succeed.
   The government accused Freeman of trading stock on the basis of
illegal insider information from Siegel, who represented Kohlberg
Kravis in the Beatrice deal. But Freeman said his only involvement
with Siegel was a phone conversation in which Siegel confirmed
rumors that the deal faced difficulties.

<HEAD>Navistar Plans Layoffs, Hints at Fourth-Quarter Loss</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Truck-maker Navistar International Corp. plans to
lay off an undetermined number of workers due to slowing demand for
its products and says it may end up posting a loss in its fourth
quarter.
   The Chicago-based company, the nation's leading manufacturer of
medium and heavy trucks, made the statements Thursday in announcing
a 41 percent drop in third-quarter earnings.
   Navistar spokesman Bill Greenhill said the company had not yet
determined how many employees would be laid off. But he indicated
the cutbacks would mainly affect the company's Springfield, Ohio,
truck-assembly plant, which employs 6,200 of Navistar's 15,000
workers.
   ``The decision was just made in the last couple of days and we're
still sorting out the manning requirements,'' Greenhill said.
   Navistar Chairman James Cotting said in a statement that after an
increase of 14 percent in the first half, industry-wide orders for
heavy trucks declined by 33 percent in Navistar's third fiscal
quarter.
   Industry orders for medium trucks fell 12 percent in the first
half and 18 percent in the third quarter.
   Greenhill said the dwindling demand reflected uncertainty among
Navistar customers about the company's future.
   Truck purchases ``represent a major capital investment'' for
large-scale buyers, he said.
   ``When there are questions about the economy, they just go into
neutral or defer their purchasing plans,'' Greenhill said.
   Navistar said in response to the slower demand it suspended
assembly operations Monday at its Springfield plant for five days
and at its Chatham, Ontario, plant in Canada for 10 days.
   Navistar also said it had cut daily production of heavy trucks at
Chatham from 54 to 49 on July 31, and that it would reduce the
Springfield plant's output of heavy and medium trucks by 15 percent,
to 298 per day, beginning Sept. 18.
   At Springfield, one of the two assembly lines will return to
one-shift operation while two shifts will be maintained on the
other, Navistar said.
   Cotting said the reduced fourth-quarter production schedules
would reduce fourth-quarter earnings below the third-quarter results
and could even result in a small loss.
   Navistar reported net income of $28 million, or 8 cents a share,
for the three months ended July 31, compared to $47 million, or 15
cents a share, in the same period a year ago.
   Sales for the third quarter totaled $1.03 billion, a 5 percent
increase over $976 million for the comparable 1988 quarter.
   The company said the earnings decline reflected unusually high
production costs caused by the company's decision to speed up
assembly operations during the quarter to meet demand for some of
its newer models.

   Billionaire developer Donald Trump promised to
make his air shuttle service a diamond when he bought it from
Eastern Airlines, but he's settling for false pearls.
   Female flight attendants employed by Trump Shuttle are now
required to wear ``faux'' pearl necklaces and earrings as part of
their uniforms, provided by the airline.
   ``It's a very nice look,'' Trump Shuttle spokeswoman Joan Fudala
said Thursday. ``It does give a very professional look to the
uniform.''
   The single-strand necklaces are about 15 inches long, Ms. Fudala
said. She noted that false pearls have been given new respectability
by First Lady Barbara Bush, who has admitted to wearing them.
   The spokeswoman said she didn't know the cost of the pearls.
Trump Shuttle, which links New York with Boston and Washington,
employs 255 flight attendants, most of them women. Their uniforms
are navy blue with burgundy stripes on the sleeves.
   Trump, who started operating the shuttle on June 8, shortly after
a federal bankruptcy judge approved the $365 million purchase from
strikebound Eastern, has pledged to spend as much as $2 million on
each plane for refurbishing, safety checks and repainting.
   ``I want the shuttle to be a diamond,'' he has said.
   The interiors of Trump's 21 Boeing 727s will be redone in
burgundy and saddle-brown tones with chrome and maple wood veneer
accents. Like the pearls, the pink marble vanities in the new
lavatories will be imitation.
   Although flight attendants often wear their own jewelry, it is
not considered a mandatory part of the uniform in the airline
business, said Barbara Steffen, a flight attendant for Trans World
Airlines.
   Since most shuttle passengers are more concerned about arriving
on time than fancy amenities, however, the flight attendants might
be casting pearls before swine.

   Steel imports rose in June for the third
consecutive month but are running sharply below 1988 for the first
half of the year, according to the American Iron and Steel Institute.
   U.S. steel exports in June continued to run substantially ahead
of recent years. June exports totaled 403,000 tons, compared with
355,000 tons in May and 126,000 tons in June 1988.
   For the first half, exports totaled 2.2 million tons, compared
with 670,000 tons in the first six months of 1988, the AISI said
Thursday.
   First-half imports totaled 8.7 million tons, down 21 percent from
11.03 million tons in the 1988 period. The shipments during the
first half of this year represented 17.3 percent, down from 20.8
percent a year earlier.
   In June, imports fell by 5.2 percent to 1.55 million tons. The
United States imported 1.47 tons of steel in May, 1.34 million tons
in April and 1.22 million tons in March, the Washington, D.C.,
producers' group said based on its interpretation of Commerce
Department reports.
   The June imports represented 18.3 percent of the domestic market,
May 17.2 percent, April 16.5 percent and March 14.4 percent.
   President Bush on July 18 granted a 30-month extension to quotas
that were due to expire Sept. 30. The quotas are designed to limit
imports to 18.5 percent of the domestic market.
   The AISI said the rise in imports coincides with a weakening of
the world market for steel and confirms the industry's contention
that other countries increase their exports to the United States
when business elsewhere softens.
   The American Institute for Imported Steel, meanwhile, said that
U.S. producers imported 1.1 million tons of semi-finished steel in
the first half.
   ``Without imported steel slab, domestic steel producers would be
unable to meet demand. Imports of finished steel products also
benefit U.S. users and distributors by relieving shortages and
cutting costs,'' said John Griffin, president of the importers'
association and president of the Houston importer Maurice Pincoffs
Co.

   The Securities and Exchange Commission has
subpoenaed several top officials and former employees of Egghead
Inc. as part of an investigation of allegations of securities fraud.
   Egghead, which owns Egghead Discount Software, one of the
nation's largest personal computer software chains, said Thursday
the investigation apparently was triggered by a class-action lawsuit
filed July 18 in U.S. District Court in Seattle by shareholders.
   The suit came after Egghead reported nearly $13 million in
unexpected losses last quarter, despite a 50 percent increase in
quarterly sales.
   Egghead blamed part of its problems on poor computerized
accounting systems. It said that as it doubled the number of its
stores in a year, it lost millions of dollars in inventory to
``shrinkage'' _ theft or other unexplained reasons.
   ``The focus of the SEC inquiry appears to be on certain facts
alleged by the plaintiff in the class-action litigation filed last
month,'' said Matt Griffin, Egghead's executive vice president in
charge of finance and administration. Griffin said Egghead is
cooperating with SEC investigators.
   Griffin said Egghead has been told by SEC staff that the inquiry
should not be construed as an indication that any law has been
violated.
   ``It is our understanding that the SEC routinely investigates
matters like these,'' he said.
   In the suit, shareholder Steve Goldman alleged he and other
shareholders were damaged as a result of misstatements in connection
with the company's initial public offering and statements during the
period from June 6, 1988, through April 24, 1989, and later public
filings.
   Egghead and its directors are accused in the suit of failing to
disclose material facts about the company's inventory systems and
finances at the time Egghead's stock went public in June 1988.
Egghead says the lawsuit is without merit.
   Griffin confirmed that Egghead founder and chairman Victor
Alhadeff was among the officers subpoenaed by the SEC.
   The Seattle Times reported Thursday that it had learned at least
two former employees had been subpoenaed and had hired lawyers to
represent them.
   Egghead reported a loss of $12.1 million or 80 cents a share for
fiscal 1989, on sales of $342.4 million.

<TEXT>
   The president and chief operating
officer of Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Association has announced his
resignation just 18 months after joining the thrift.
   Lawrence K. Fish, who said Thursday he was resigning effective
Sept. 30, comes as Columbia tries to devise a new financial strategy
after Congress barred savings and loans from holding junk bonds as
part of the multibillion thrift bailout.
   Fish was credited with helping Columbia decentralize operations,
with senior managers assuming more responsibility.
   But Columbia said it no longer needed both a chief executive and
chief operating officer after the restructuring, which was
undertaken following a period of rapid growth.
   Columbia last week reported that its second-quarter profits
plunged to $6.4 million from $27.1 million in the same period in
1988, reflecting a big drop from its securities-investment activity.
   Fish, 44, had a salary of $385,000 in 1988 and $1.5 million in
bonuses for a total of nearly $2 million. Columbia Chairman Thomas
Spiegel was paid $5.6 million in 1987 and $4.1 million last year.
   Siegel said a search was under way for someone to lead Columbia's
thrift operations permanently.
   The thrift, known for its large holdings of high-yield, high-risk
bonds, has about 30 percent of its $13.1 billion in total assets
invested in junk bonds.
   But the savings and loan bailout bill signed by President Bush
last week requires thrifts to liquidate their holding in such bonds
within five years.
   ``Columbia has got a real problem on its hands,'' said Bert Ely,
an Alexandria, Va.-based financial institutions consultant.
``They're going to have to do a massive downsizing as they get rid
of the junk bonds and try to decide just what is going to be their
business.''
   Columbia also is known for its close ties to California political
figures, and its relationship with former Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc. financier Michael Milken, who was indicted earlier this year on
securities fraud charges.
   Milken raised much of Columbia's junk-bond financing and the
thrift has said it has provided documents to federal investigators
as part of a continuing probe into Milken's activities. Milken
headed Drexel's Beverly Hills-based high-yield bond department until
resigning following his March indictment.

   When Generoso Pope ruled the National
Enquirer, executives often proposed taking the often outrageous
tabloid beyond American supermarket checkout lines.
   The plans always were rejected by a man who often diverted his
energies to elaborate Christmas decorations and meticulous
landscaping around the publication's headquarters here.
   But the new owners of the National Enquirer and Weekly World News
tabloids say they see no obstacles for expansion plans that include
Spanish-language and international editions.
   Although no formal deals have been made for foreign editions,
talks are continuing with several British publishers, including
Robert Maxwell, who unsuccessfully tried to acquire the Enquirer's
publisher, GP Group Inc., following Pope's death in October.
   ``We are looking at a number of possibilities to publish outside
the United States and Mr. Maxwell is just one of those we have
spoken with,'' said Michael Boylan, president of Macfadden Holdings
Inc.
   Macfadden and Boston Ventures, a media-oriented investment firm,
paid $412.5 million for GP Group in April.
   The National Enquirer, which Pope purchased from Hearst Corp. in
1952 for $75,000, is the nation's leading tabloid with weekly
circulation of about 4.3 million. The more sensational Weekly World
News sells about 1.3 million.
   Murdoch Magazines' runner-up Star sells about 3.6 million copies
weekly, and Globe Communications Corp. reports a total weekly
circulation of about 3.2 million from its Sun, Globe and National
Examiner papers.
   Macfadden owns several romance and teen monthly publications, the
largest of which is True Story, with circulation of 1.3 million.
Boston Ventures last year acquired Motown Records in a venture with
MCA Inc.
   Macfadden is in early stages of planning a Spanish-language
edition targeted for the large Hispanic populations in such cities
as New York, Miami, Los Angeles and San Antonio, Texas, said Boylan.
   ``We want it to be basically the same paper, but we'll tailor it
to include people and celebrities the Hispanic community knows and
follows,'' said Boylan, who would not predict a date for the new
edition.
   Boylan said the United Kingdom likely would be the beachhead for
the overseas expansion, which could begin by early next year. He
said other countries, such as Australia, also were being studied.
   He described Macfadden's proposed foreign tabloids as a
combination of the stories from the U.S. editions and other articles
of local or international interest.
   While New York-based Macfadden hasn't tampered with Pope's
editorial formula _ although some other eccentricities have been
dropped such as a $1 million Christmas tree and keeping the company
grass four inches high _ analysts have predicted that cost-cutting
measures will be needed to cover the high acquisition price.
   In June, Macfadden announced the layoffs of 20 workers from
editorial, advertising and other departments. An additional 37 jobs
were trimmed last month when the News printing operation was
transferred from Pompano Beach to Atlanta.
   The price of the Enqurier was raised from 75 cents to 85 cents
following the purchase and the Weekly World News rose a nickle to 70
cents.
   Last year, the Enquirer and News reportedly earned $15 million on
revenue of about $150 million.
   Boylan also said Macfadden remained interested in launching a
soap opera publication but had not yet decided on a format or when
such a publication could appear.
   Boylan said distribution of the U.S. projects could be handled by
the company's DSI unit, which has nearly 600 full- and part-time
workers managing rack space at about 19,000 supermarkets and
retailers.

   The dollar was down in quiet trading in Europe
today, and spot gold was steady.
   The dollar slipped half a pfennig against the West German mark in
the first half-hour of trading but did not fall below 1.9600 marks.
   One dealer at a large West German bank said he expected a narrow
1.9600-1.9650-mark trading range until the release of U.S. consumer
price data for July.
   One dealer at a public-sector bank in Frankfurt said he expected
the dollar to decline in the coming week.
   Rates for the dollar this morning, compared with Thursday's
closing rates, included: 1.9610 West German marks, down from 1.9690;
1.6905 Swiss francs, down from 1.6980; 6.6215 French francs, down
from 6.6325; 2.2110 Dutch guilders, down from 2.2190; 1,408.50
Italian lire, down from 1,412.00; 1.1795 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1815.
   In London, one British pound fetched $1.5639, more expensive for
buyers than Thursday's $1.5590.
   In Tokyo, the dollar firmed to 143.58 yen, up 1.20 yen from the
close on Thursday. In London this morning, the dollar traded at
143.16 yen.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $366.25 a troy ounce,
down from $366.35 Thursday. At midmorning the city's five major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $366.30 an ounce.
   Gold traded in Zurich at $366.50, compared to $365.25 per troy
ounce late Thursday.
   In Hong Kong, gold closed at $367.01 per troy ounce, up from
Thursday's closing price of $366.45 per troy ounce.
   Silver bullion traded in London at $5.25 a troy ounce, down from
$5.20.

<HEAD>Dollar Gains Against Yen, Nikkei Declines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>

   Improved U.S. trade figures helped push the dollar
higher against the yen today, while stock prices declined, traders
said.
   The dollar opened at 143.50 yen, up 1.18 yen from Thursday's
close. It finished trading at 143.52 yen after ranging between
143.05 and 143.58 yen.
   Traders said the dollar's higher opening was due to
better-than-expected U.S. trade figures released Thursday, which
triggered dollar buying in London and New York.
   The U.S. trade deficit in June fell to $8.2 billion, down 18.9
percent from the previous month's $10.1 billion.
   But the dollar gradually moved downward from the opening because
``market players were selling the dollar for profit taking,'' said a
trader with the Bank of Tokyo, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   By the end of the day, however, the dollar had returned to its
opening level.
   ``There was no real reason to sell (dollars),'' said Sumio
Fukushima of Sumitomo Bank.
   He said the dollar appeared to be in a ``box,'' with dealers
unwilling to let it escape from a narrow range.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
shed 26.97 points, or 0.08 percent, closing at 35,063.14. It had
gained a marginal 5.96 points Thursday.
   Trading focused on high-priced issues, such as Sony, TDK and
Japan Victor Corp., said Haruhito Ichimura, an analyst for Nippon
Kangyo Kakumaru Securities.
   Electricals and precision instrument issues attracted strong
buyer interest, he said.
   ``The decline of the yen (on the exchange market) has been a plus
for export issues,'' Ichimura said.
   Trading was thin, with only 450 million shares changing hands on
the first section, unchanged from Thursday.
   Ichimura said the market was likely to return to its usual volume
on Monday when market participants who have been on vacation return
to work.

<TEXT>
   A new minivan and a sport-utility vehicle will
begin appearing next year in what some may think are unlikely places
_ Oldsmobile dealerships.
   It will be the first time that Oldsmobile dealers have marketed
trucks in the history of the General Motors Corp. division.
Oldsmobile cars traditionally have been sold to middle-age,
well-established consumers. Minivans and sport vehicles are aimed at
a younger market.
   Oldsmobile officials have been trying to change the division's
long-standing image, mainly through its Cutlass line of cars and an
advertising campaign featuring the slogan ``This is not your
father's Oldsmobile.''
   A four-door, sport-utility vehicle will be made at GM's Moraine,
Ohio, plant, GM Truck &amp; Bus Group spokeswoman Mary Ann Tyler said
Thursday.
   ``Oldsmobile will sell a version of the new vehicle that is going
to be introduced as a 1990 model next summer,'' she said, adding she
didn't know what the vehicle would be named.
   The Moraine plant now makes Chevrolet S-10 and GMC S-15 pickup
trucks.
   Previously, GM announced that Oldsmobile dealers would sell
versions of its new minivan, called the Silhouette, next year. That
vehicle, being made now in North Tarrytown, N.Y., along with
Chevrolet Lumina and Pontiac Trans Sport minivans, will go on sale
later this year.
   Clifford Vaughan, vice president and group executive for the
Truck &amp; Bus Group, said in a recent interview with the Oakland Press
of Pontiac, Mich., Oldsmobile will get a top-of-the-line version of
the four-door sport-utility vehicle.
   The company has said it plans to introduce a four-door model of
the Chevrolet Blazer next year.
   Analyst Kathleen Heaney of Nikko Securities Co. International
Inc. in New York City said she was concerned with ``badge
engineering,'' or making minor, if any, changes in a car and putting
a different nameplate on it.
   ``They are doing the same thing with the minivan,'' she said.
``It's going right back to what they used to do _ making everything
look alike.''
   However, Heaney said the decision to put a sport-utility vehicle
in Oldsmobile dealerships may be a good one.
   ``It moves the Olds image a little bit upscale and the Jeep
products are expensive,'' she said. ``Those are upscale buyers,
maybe that's GM's strategy.''

   The stock market was mostly lower in early
trading, pressured by new economic data that suggested inflation
might not be easing.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 1.33 points to
2,678.30 at 10 a.m. EDT, 30 minutes after the opening bell.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 6 to 5 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 486 issues down, 396 up and 558 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 19.60 million shares.
   The Labor Department announced today that consumer inflation rose
a modest 0.2 percent in July, held down by the sharpest drop in
gasoline prices in nearly three years.
   The number was in line with expectations, analysts said. But many
investors were focusing on the 0.4 percent rise in the index
excluding food and energy, the most volatile components.
   ``The CPI report, while it looks good on the headline, when you
read further in there is concern that we have seen the lows in
inflation and will be moving higher in the months ahead,'' said
James Solloway, economist with Argus Research Corp.
   Solloway said the market's weakness reflected some disappointment
that the Federal Reserve is not going to ease credit conditions in
the near future.
   Prices for the first seven months of 1989 rose at a 5.5 percent
annual rate, more than a full percentage point higher than the 4.4
percent increases in both 1988 and 1987, the government said.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was up
0.04 to 191.99.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index was off
0.15 to 378.19.
   On Thursday, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 13.66
points to finish at 2,679.63, after trading down about 25 points
during the session.
   Declining issues outnumbered gainers by a margin of about 8 to 5
in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
887 issues down, 561 up and 540 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 157.56 million
shares, up from 150.06 million in Wednesday's session.

   Jim Badtke's new farm implement won't
milk Elsie or plow the back 40, but it can identify his most
productive cows and calculate the best time to water the crops.
   Badtke is one of a growing number of farmers nationwide who have
added a personal computer to their collection of tools to make a
living off the land.
   Farmers are using computers to help plan their finances, manage
their herds and tell them when to irrigate. Despite the time it
takes to learn how to use a computer, they say the technology can
make their operations more efficient and let them reap more profits
in the uncertain world of modern-day agriculture.
   Badtke said he plans to use his computer to rank his cows, so he
knows which are the most efficient.
   ``By culling cows at the right time we could be saving on feed,''
he said, noting that he spends about $60,000 a year on cattle feed.
``That's what you're after, to gain more of an edge.''
   ``Farming is definitely a business. It was a business 10 years
ago, but the margins have been narrowed and the costs of being wrong
are so high that you can't afford to be wrong too often,'' said
Arlin Brannstrom, assistant director of the North Central Computer
Institute in Madison, a resource for agricultural software.
   ``I'm sure a lot of farms were lost because they didn't have
enough information,'' he said.
   The farm computer business started to sprout around the beginning
of the decade, at the same time the agricultural economy was sliding
into a recession.
   ``In the 70s, there was tremendous expansion in agriculture. It
gave a lot of prosperity to a lot of people,'' said Gary Randolph,
president of Harvest Computer Systems, a farm software company in
Alexandria, Ind. ``In the 80s, things tightened up.''
   ``It just happened that this technology came around in the 80s,''
he said. ``It was fortuitous _ the economy created a need and the
technology filled that need.''
   Estimates vary on the number of farmers using computers. John
Brunz, executive director of the Association of Agricultural
Computing Companies, said numbers range from 8 percent to 20 percent.
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture says 15 percent of farm
operators in 1988 with gross sales of $250,000 or more were using
computers for record keeping. The department says farmers in that
category accounted for more than half of all farm sales.
   The North Central Computer Institute lists about 1,900 titles of
different agricultural software, some developed by private companies
and others by universities.
   ``There's been a very rapid growth,'' Brannstrom said.
``Obviously 10 years ago there was almost nothing on the shelf.''
   The computer programs range from basic accounting to helping
farmers tend their crops.
   For example, researchers at the University of Wisconsin this year
introduced a computer program that tells potato farmers the best
times to apply pesticides and irrigate.
   George Rice, who supervised the project, said the program
combines principles of horticulture, entomology, plant pathology and
agronomy, but all a farmer needs to know is simple data, such as
temperatures and humidity.
   Without such assistance, Rice said, a farmer would be ``flying in
the dark.''
   ``He might use irrigation when the soil already has water,'' he
said. ``He might spray when he doesn't have to apply as much
pesticide.''
   The program costs about $245, but as Rice said, ``it could pay
for itself with one application of pesticide, or one
misapplication.''
   The computer program this year saved about $250,000 for the R.D.
Offutt Co., of Fargo, N.D., which owns several potato farms, said
Dale Steevens, an agronomist for the company.
   Steevens said information from the program allowed operators to
wait longer before spraying fungicides.
   ``Before, it was just a best guess, based on previous
experience,'' he said.
   Farmers also use home computers to tap databases that provide
up-to-the-minute information on the weather, commodity markets and
world events that can shape the agriculture economy.
   A company that sells such a service is AgriData Resources Inc.,
in Milwaukee, which started in 1981.
   Ed Markham, president of the company, said until recently,
farmers focused on ways to expand production, ``but there's been
very little emphasis on marketing the product and running the farm
as a business.''
   One of AgriData's customers is Robert Vogts, a farmer in
Arlington, Wis., who grows corn and peas.
   Vogts said while the information is useful in planning, ``you've
still got to make the decision when to buy and sell.''
   On one occasion, Vogts said, he was waiting for corn prices to
reach a recommended target before selling. The price came close to
the target, but then dropped quickly, and Vogts said in retrospect,
he should not have followed the recommendations so strictly.
   But Vogts and others say computer equipment is well worth the
investment, especially in relation to other farm machinery that can
cost more than $100,000.
   ``A computer investment doesn't compare,'' said Norlin Hein, a
professor of agricultural economics at the University of Missouri.
``It's about the same price as a used pickup truck, and not a very
good used pickup.''

<HEAD>Davis Hints at Higher Bid; Bass, British Air Reportedly Interested
In United</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investor Marvin Davis has hinted he may further
sweeten his $6.2 billion buyout offer for UAL Corp. after the
company's board issued a cool response to his overtures and
confirmed that other bidders have emerged for the parent of United
Airlines.
   ``We are prepared to proceed promptly with our ... investigation
in order to determine if a higher price than our $275 per share
proposal is warranted,'' Davis said in a statement today.
   Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal today quoted sources familiar
with United as saying Texas investor Robert Bass and a team formed
by British Airways PLC and Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. had expressed
interest in bidding for the nation's second-largest airline.
   United declined to confirm the report.
   ``We have said the company has been contacted by various third
parties but we have not identified any of them,'' spokesman Joe
Hopkins said.
   The UAL board met Thursday to review Davis' offer and released a
short statement late in the evening saying it was still premature to
make any decision on whether to sell the company.
   The board also confirmed speculation that it had been contacted
by other potential buyers and that UAL's financial advisers had met
with an employee group.
   The company statement did not specify which employee group was
involved and spokeswoman Sara Dornacker refused to say if it was
United's pilots, whose union has expressed interest in buying UAL.
   Ms. Dornacker also would not identify other potential buyers who
have surfaced.
   Davis responded to the meeting with a statement saying he and his
associates were awaiting ``with interest the board's conclusions and
continue to look forward to working with UAL's board, management and
labor groups to develop a transaction that works to the benefit of
all parties concerned.''
   On Wednesday, Davis raised his original $5.4 billion, or $240 a
share, bid to $6.2 billion. Davis also said his offer could go
higher after a review of the company's financial data.
   In its statement Thursday, the board said that ``all possible
financial and strategic alternatives should continue to be pursued.''
   The company's stock, which climbed a dizzying $90 per share in
less than two weeks in anticipation of a bidding war for United, was
up $3.87{ to $270.25 a share in early New York Stock Exchange
trading today.
   Davis has filed documents in preparation for a possible proxy
fight to unseat the UAL board and replace it with directors more
sympathetic to his bid.
   There has been speculation in recent days that UAL Chairman
Stephen Wolf, in conjunction with other UAL executives, may be
planning a bid for the company himself or a recapitalization of the
firm.
   There also has been talk that the leveraged buyout firms
Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts &amp; Co. and Forstmann Little &amp; Co. have
contacted UAL about a possible deal.
   The airline's pilots' and machinists' unions have been mentioned
as key players in any scenario for restructuring the company. The
United unit of the Air Line Pilots Association, with 7,125 members,
made a bid for the company in 1987.

<HEAD>Grain Futures Gain On Export News, Crop Estimate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly
higher in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade,
bolstered by new export business and a private firm's surprisingly
low crop estimates.
   The early gains were limited, however, by forecasts for rain in
the Midwest this weekend and next week.
   ``All the news, with the exception of weather, is bullish,'' said
Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in
Chicago.
   Among the positive fundamentals were new crop estimates from
Memphis-based Sparks Commodities Inc., a private analytical firm,
that were lower than the government projections issued last week.
   Sparks pegged the U.S soybean crop at 1.84 billion bushels,
compared to the Agriculture Department's estimate of 1.91 billion,
and Sparks pegged the corn crop at 7.05 billion bushels compared to
the USDA's projected 7.35 billion.
   Buying of corn and wheat futures was also stimulated by news that
Mexico had purchased more than 400,000 metric tons of U.S. corn and
that China bought 150,000 metric tons of corn and 100,000 metric
tons of wheat.
   The sales of U.S. grain to China were the first in two years and
could portend more business down the road.
   In early trading, wheat was unchanged to 1 cent higher with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.97{ a bushel; corn was 1
cent to 2} cents higher with September at $2.38 a bushel; oats were
1{ cents to 1} cents higher with September at $1.38} a bushel;
soybeans were 3{ cents to 9 cents higher with August at $6.17 a
bushel.
   Cattle futures were mostly lower while pork futures were mixed in
early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Today is the last
trading day for the August live cattle and hog contracts.
   Live cattle were .15 cent lower to .05 cent higher with August at
73.80 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .08 cent lower to .05 cent
higher with August at 84.57 cents a pound; live hogs were .12 cent
lower to .65 cent higher with August at 48.50 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .37 cent lower to .40 cent higher with August at
27 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mixed on Thursday.

   Consumer inflation rose a modest 0.2 percent in
July, held down by the sharpest drop in gasoline prices in nearly
three years, the government said today.
   The increase in the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index last
month matched the gain in June. Together, the two reprts showed the
mildest two-month inflation picture since July-August 1986 and
marked a sharp contrast to surging prices in the first five months
of the year.
   Even with the recent slowdown, prices for the first seven months
of 1989 rose at a 5.5 percent annual rate, more than a full
percentage point higher than the 4.4 percent increases in both 1988
and 1987.
   The Labor Department said the most recent dampening of cost
pressures reflected drops in prices of gasoline and apparel,
particularly women's clothing, and a moderate rise in food costs.
   ``It's more good news,'' said economist Sandra Shaber of the
Futures Group, a Washington consulting firm. ``The overall trend has
been that the economy is, in fact, achieving the soft landing
everyone was hoping for. In other words, growth is continuing but
inflation is under control.''
   In a separate report, the department said the moderation in
inflation produced a 1.5 percent jump in Americans' average real
earnings, to $338.01 a week. It was the largest advance since
February 1982 and followed a slight 0.1 percent gain in June.
   In reaction to the inflation news, the stock market dipped
slightly in early trading today. Analysts said traders believed the
price moderation was not dramatic enough to spur the Federal Reserve
Board into loosening credit anytime soon.
   However, in Kennebunkport, Maine, presidential spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said, ``We believe inflation is on a downward trend (and)
... lower inflation should take the pressure off interest rates.''
The administration has been pressuring the Fed not to choke off
economic growth, which would sharply reduce tax revenue and inflate
the budget deficit.
   Gasoline prices, after shooting up 21.2 percent in the first five
months of the year, fell 1.0 percent in June and dropped an
additional 2.2 percent in July, the sharpest decline since October
1986.
   However, fuel oil costs rose 1.5 percent last month, reversing
June's decline of 1.2 percent, and natural gas was up 0.5 percent.
   Food and beverage costs rose a moderate 0.3 percent in July
following a 0.2 percent June gain. That was a moderation from the
first five months of the year, when the lingering effects of last
year's drought sent food prices up at a 9.3 percent annual rate.
   Cereal products, beverages and sweets all rose substantially, but
they were offset by a 0.7 percent drop in the index for meats,
poultry, fish and eggs.
   Clothing costs were down 0.8 percent last month, following a 1.1
percent decline in June. Prices for women's and girls' apparel fell
2.0 percent and those for infants and toddlers dropped 4.8 percent.
   The Labor Department attributed the declines to larger-than-usual
end-of-the-season price discounts for women's clothing.
   The price of goods and services other than food and energy rose
0.4 percent, driven up by a 2.0 percent gain for tobacco but
dampened by a 0.4 percent decline for new cars.
   The various changes in July left the overall Consumer Price Index
at 124.4 percent of its 1982-84 base. That means a hypothetical
selection of goods costing $100 during the base period would have
cost $124.40 in July, up 30 cents from June.
   The moderation in consumer prices had been expected by economists
and was sure to be greeted as good news at the Federal Reserve
Board, which had been raising interest rates in order to slow the
economy and cool inflationary pressures.
   In June, the central bank reversed course and began pushing
interest rates down after spotting widespread evidence that the
economy had softened. The recent good news on inflation is likely to
confirm analysts' belief that the Fed's decision to shift policy was
warranted.
   Although inflation in the first six months of the year was the
worst first-half performance since 1982, economists generally expect
the moderating trend of the last two months to continue.
   Economist Donald Ratajczak of Georgia State University, who
conducts his own independent price surveys, said, ``Our preliminary
projections suggest that inflation may remain subdued in August ...
(and) that when energy prices stabilize in the fall, consumer prices
will return to a 4 percent path.''
   The Federal Reserve Board, according to a report to Congress by
Chairman Alan Greenspan last month, is a bit less optimistic than
private analysts, although it agrees that price increases will
moderate in the second half.
   It is anticipating an inflation rate of between 5 percent and 5.5
percent for 1989.
   The Bush administration, in a forecast released last month,
predicted an inflation rate of 5 percent for all of 1989 _ implying
an annual rate of about 4 percent from July through December _ and a
1990 rate of 4.1 percent.
   That was only slightly brighter than the consensus of 50 private
economists compiled by Blue Chip Economic Indicators of Sedona,
Ariz. It forecast a 5.1 percent increase in costs this year,
followed by a 4.6 percent rise in 1990.

   Eastern Airlines claims it's doing so well
rebuilding from a crippling strike that it will be bigger than
expected, and the carrier may decide not to sell its prized South
American routes.
   American Airlines, the chief bidder for Eastern's usually
profitable Latin routes, expressed frustration at the lack of
progress in negotiations on the sale, The Miami Herald reported in
today's editions.
   ``We're discouraged (because) the talks are so intermittent that
it's hard to define the status,'' said American spokesman Ed
Stewart. ``The frustration factor is very real _ it's really not
clear that they want to sell.''
   Eastern President Phil Bakes told The Associated Press the
carrier will be selling fewer assets than anticipated when it first
began trying to come back from the strike and Chapter 11 bankruptcy
reorganization.
   Bakes wouldn't go into details on the South American route
negotiations and said he didn't ``want to set odds'' on whether they
would be sold.
   ``We have made no final decision to sell South America. We have
been in negotiations ... We don't have an agreement and our board
has not made a decision to sell South America,'' Bakes said.
   ``We will have more employees, it will service more cities and
we'll have more airplanes,'' Bakes said in an interview.
   A pilots union spokesman Thursday expressed doubt about Bakes'
projections and said Eastern is raising safety concerns by rushing
its rebuilding efforts.
   But Bakes said management is pleased about Eastern's progress
since it announced plans to emerge at two-thirds its pre-strike size
from Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. The walkout by the
airline's three unions began March 4.
   ``What we announced last April was the impossible, and there were
a lot of skeptics, to say the least,'' Bakes said in the interview
Wednesday. ``The fact is, we're exceeding targets (and) we will
accelerate the schedule a little bit.''
   Bakes detailed the revised, increased plans:
   _Instead of 17,000 employees planned, there will be
``18,000-plus, maybe more.''
   _Instead of 1,700 pilots planned, there will be more ``in the
next year or two, maybe in the next few months in small groups.''
   _Instead of 157 aircraft, Eastern next year will fly 165 to 180
planes and also has the first nine of 40 new Boeing aircraft on
order available for 1992.
   _Instead of 800 daily flights serving 77 cities, Eastern will
probably add cities and flights, but no figures have been decided
upon.
   _Instead of $1.8 billion in assets sales, the figure may be as
low as $1.5 billion. Fewer assets may be sold because transactions
such as aircraft sales, Philadelphia gates and the Northeast shuttle
sale have earned more money than expected and Eastern is winning
back customers at faster rates than expected.
   Ron Cole, a spokesman for Eastern's pilots union, noted reports
that Eastern is falling hundreds of millions of dollars behind on
revenue.
   ``I don't see how he can sit there with a straight face and say
they're doing better than anticipated,'' he said.
   The Air Line Pilots Association, which represents pilots at
nearly every major carrier, is considering a nationwide suspension
of service to show support for Eastern's strikers. The union's
executive council is in a two-day meeting.
   Cole claimed Eastern flights experienced at least two unsafe
landings in recent days because of inexperienced pilots.
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said the company had anticipated
financial losses throughout this year and that losses have been less
than expected. Matell said the unions continue to try to use safety
allegations as a weapon against the company.
   Union leaders said Eastern also is having trouble keeping up with
maintenance of its aircraft because it lacks mechanics and spare
parts.
   Bakes said 750 to 800 union pilots have crossed picket lines, but
later clarified that about 100 of those are pilots who signed
preferential recall lists after Eastern stopped taking union pilots
back. He said it has graduated 300 new pilots and has 700 in
training.
   ALPA contends any union pilot must get job preference over a
pilot still in training, but Bakes said Eastern is committed to
protecting the pilots in training.

   The stock market was mostly higher in moderate
trading today after an earlier slide following new economic data
that renewed inflationary worries.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 4.55 points to
2,684.18 at noon EDT. The blue-chip indicator was down 0.95 point an
hour earlier.
   Declining issues narrowly outnumbered advances by about 9 to 8 on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 650 issues down, 546 up and 616
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 65.34 million shares.
   Traders said the market was trendless after dipping earlier in
response to a slide in the bond market. Bond holders bid prices down
after a Labor Department report early today that showed consumer
inflation rose 0.2 percent in July.
   While the number was in line with expectations, investors focused
on the 0.4 percent rise in the index excluding food and energy, the
most volatile components, analysts said. The data was interpreted as
another indication that the Federal Reserve was unlikely to lower
interest rates.
   ``The CPI report, while it looks good on the headline, when you
read further in there is concern that we have seen the lows in
inflation and will be moving higher in the months ahead,'' said
James Solloway, economist with Argus Research Corp.
   Stephen van Brunt, equities trader with Nikko Securities

takeover battle.

<TEXT>
   Isosceles PLC, which last month beat rival bidder
Newgateway PLC for majority control of British supermarket operator
Gateway Corp. PLC, said Friday it has reached a truce with its
rival, which still has a 40-percent holding in Gateway.
   Under the truce, Newgateway, which comprises U.S. financiers
Wasserstein Perella and Co. and the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea
Co., will exchange its holding for a proportionate stake in
Isoceles. It will have representation on Gateway's board of
directors, and will support Isosceles in implementing ``its
commercial strategy.''
   Newgateway is forbidden to increase its holding above 49.8
percent, unless Isosceles' board backs such a move.
   Newgateway lifted its stake in Gateway to the 40-percent level
after losing the takeover contest last month. This holding
represented a potential block to Isosceles' reorganization plans for
Gateway.
   Isosceles, made up of a group of disgruntled Gateway
shareholders, won the contest with a bid valuing Gateway at between
2.05 billion pounds, or $3.2 billion, and 2.23 billion pounds, or
$3.5 billion.

<HEAD>Swinging Moods On Wall Street</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA C. MARTINEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It doesn't take much to shatter deeply held
convictions on Wall Street.
   Just when investors become convinced of one scenario, the
economic winds shift, so-called in-depth analyses are blown away and
it's time to change strategies.
   Investors recently got comfortable with the notion that the
economy was sliding into a possibly severe recession and adjusted
their portfolios accordingly, accumulating so-called `defensive'
issues such as food, tobacco and soaps.
   The new thought is that the economy is stronger than expected, as
suggested by the latest government statistics on everything from
retail sales and homebuilding to trade and industrial production.
   Stock strategists are now talking of a revival in cyclical
stocks, those that rise and fall with changes in the economy. Autos,
chemicals, steel, metals and paper, which fit into this category,
had been depressed lately compared to the rest of the market.
   Some strategists say the market began to show it was shifting
gears about two weeks ago with the emergence of Phelps Dodge Corp.,
the largest domestic producer of copper at about the time the July
employment report was released. Other cyclicals have since followed.
   ``The psychology is that the turndown is getting near the
bottom,'' said John Burnett, senior vice president for Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. ``If people can justify going out and buying GM
then they think things are OK.''
   The July employment report showed joblessness down a notch to 5.2
percent and job growth stronger than expected. June job growth also
was revised upward. That was followed by unexpectedly strong July
retail sales last week. But the real kicker in the retail sales
report were the revisions to May and June figures, which suggested
that three months back consumers were actually buying more than many
investors had realized.
   That made an imminent consumer-led recession almost impossible,
stock strategists concluded. Overnight, those who days earlier
warned of recession this year softened their predictions.
   Subsequent reports on homebuilding, industrial production and
trade led economists to conclude that the economy is in a modest
expansion.
   ``A market that responds to ancient history as this market has
done is lacking in long-term conviction,'' said Alfred E. Goldman,
vice president at going.''
   Richard McCabe, manager of market analysis at Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co., says people have lost sight of what the numbers mean.
   ``I wonder why people seem to hang their hats on one number when
experience shows that's going to change,'' he said.
   The numbers rekindled fears in some sectors of a renewed
inflationary surge. Investors have scurried to shift their
portfolios around and change investment strategies.
   Economist Edward Yardeni of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.,
says the excessive mood swings and volatility are the result of
shortsightedness brought on by the October 1987 stock market crash.
   ``The crash unnerved a lot of investors,'' Yardeni said. ``They
thought recession and depression but the economy fooled them and
continued to grow at a very solid pace. So investors lost confidence
and the ability to get a handle on the economy.''
   The mood swings have been more volatile than the underlying
economy, Yardeni is quick to add.
   Yardeni says despite the market swings he has remained bullish
throughout the year in recommending ``rustbowl'' stocks such as
chemicals, aluminum and steel.
   But there is plenty of uncertainty left and the market isn't
totally convinced yet that defensive stocks are passe. For the time
being, many analysts believe, the ``hold some, fold some'' strategy
is the safest.

<HEAD>Warner, Chris-Craft Take Step Toward Settling Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Warner Communications Inc. and Chris-Craft
Industries Inc. took a big step Friday toward disentangling their
corporate ties, announcing settlement of several legal disputes that
have blocked the separation.
   The relationship was forged several years ago when Warner, the
entertainment giant, recruited Chris-Craft to help it fend off
unwanted takeover overtures.
   Chris-Craft became Warner's largest shareholder, controlling an
18 percent interest in Warner through its majority-owned subsidiary,
BHC Communications Inc., while Warner bought a 42.5 percent stake in
BHC.
   But Warner indicated this spring it wanted to sever those ties
after it agreed to merge with, and later to be acquired by, media
giant Time Inc.
   Warner dropped its right to match any offer Chris-Craft may get
for its stake in Warner and gave Chris-Craft a choice of options on
what it wanted done with Warner's stake in BHC.
   They have been in court in Delaware trying to resolve several
issues resulting from the Warner deal with Time and Friday's
announcement described the settlement of some of those legal
disputes.
   The Time offer for Warner called for a payment of $70 a share in
cash for half of Warner's outstanding stock followed by an exchange
of each remaining Warner share for a package of a still undetermined
mix of cash and securities valued at $70.
   Under Friday's settlement, it was agreed that Warner's interest
in BHC would be distributed to Warner stockholders as part of the
package of cash and securities comprising the second part of Time's
tender offer for Warner.
   In addition, Warner agreed to repurchase 1.3 million of BHC's 6.5
million shares of Warner Series B convertible preferred stock for
$143.7 million.
   That purchase will leave Chris-Craft with about 6 percent of
Warner's common and preferred stock, pending completion of the
second half of the tender offer.
   The settlement also provided that the Warner stake in BHC that is
being spun off to Warner shareholders will comprise 40 percent of
the equity and 6.25 percent of the voting power in new BHC.
Chris-Craft controls the rest.
   The settlement leaves unresolved Chris-Craft's assertion that it
has the right to judge the fairness of the second phase of the
tender offer for Warner because it is the lone holder of Warner
Series B convertible preferred stock.
   Warner contends no such right exists and the dispute remains at
issue in Delaware Chancery Court.

   Share prices continued their upward march Friday,
as bullish corporate news, encouraging economic data and scattered
speculative buying pushed the main index to a new 1989 high.
   The market opened stronger and then shot higher on Thursday's
release of a U.S. government report that said Wellcome PLC's AIDS
drug, AZT, is safer and much more effective against the disease than
earlier studies have shown.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed 15.1

<HEAD>New Car Battery Has a Built-In Spare</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People who habitually leave the headlights on,
the doors locked and the jumper cables at home are target customers
for a new battery from GNB Inc. that has a built-in spare.
   The squarish Champion Switch combines a conventional 12-volt main
battery and a reserve into a package that fits in about 70 percent
of the cars on the road, GNB said.
   If the main battery dies because the lights were left on, the
driver can flip a switch on it and start the car off the reserve.
The reserve is good for 20 engine starts, just in case the engine
keeps conking out, and both main battery and reserve can be
recharged.
   The Champion Switch does well in sub-zero weather, especially
with the reserve switched on, although that is not its main feature,
said Thomas Hatterschide, a GNB vice president for engineering.
   The suggested retail price is $109.99, roughly twice the price of
conventional batteries, although some retailer discounting is likely.
   The battery goes on sale in Southeastern states around Oct. 1 and
elsewhere in the country in 1990, as the factory in Columbus, Ga.,
gears up production. It has been on sale in Australia since November.
   Back-up batteries have not been popular because there was no room
for them under the hood. GNB's Pulsar design makes it possible to
create battery ``slices'' by re-grouping the positive and negative
plates. The slice has the same voltage as a regular battery but less
current.
   GNB is based in St. Paul, Minn., and is a subsidiary of Pacific
Dunlop Ltd. of Melbourne, Australia. It is not connected with
Champion Spark Plug Co., although it has rights to use the Champion
logo.

   Fixed-rate home mortgages are currently

Friday by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
   That rate was up from a rate of 9.96 percent last week.
   On one-year adjustable rate mortgages, lenders were asking an
average initial rate of 8.69 percent this week, up from 8.62 percent
the week before, Freddie Mac said.

   Bell Atlantic and one of its unions agreed on
major issues of a new contract that could end a 13-day strike by
next week, and Pacific Telesis today reported substantial progress
towards settling its own employee walkout, union and company
officials said.
   A tentative agreement was worked out between Bell Atlantic and
the Communications Workers of America on Thursday after more than
two months of bargaining and a strike that slowed services to Bell
Atlantic customers in the mid-Atlantic states.
   Regional issues were resolved while leaving local issues to be
worked out in further talks.
   Bell Atlantic subsidiaries were to resume talks today with the
CWA on the local issues. Bargaining also was to continue with the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.
   Both unions also are striking another regional Bell company,
NYNEX, which serves the Northeast. CWA alone is striking two other
regional Bells: Ameritech, which serves five Midwestern states; and
Pacific Telesis, which serves California and Nevada.
   Pacific Bell spokesman Lou Saviano said CWA and Pacific
negotiators made ``very substantial progress yesterday'' and the day
before, but there still were unresolved issues. Talks continued
today.
   No contract talks were scheduled at NYNEX or Ameritech.
   In Washington, CWA spokesman Bill Bickers said the Bell Atlantic
agreement will have no direct effect on the other strikes, but
``hopefully this will give some impetus to those units to reach an
agreement.''
   Union officials said the CWA workers will not return to work at
Bell Atlantic until all local issues are resolved and the IBEW
reaches agreement with the company. But both sides said a final
accord could be reached within days.
   ``The major strike issues of wages and health benefits have been
resolved,'' Bickers said at a news conference. ``This does not mean
that the strike is over. But the way has been paved to resolve local
issues. We are prepared to negotiate around the clock over the next
several days to settle the outstanding issues.''
   Company spokesman Christopher Clouser called the agreement ``very
fair'' and one that balances the needs of employees, customers and
shareowners.
   ``We're very confident and hopeful that it's both in our interest
and the union's to have people back to work ... next week,'' Clouser
said.
   The local issues include disputes over job-title and work-rule
changes at each of Bell Atlantic's subsidiaries in Pennsylvania, New
Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia and the District
of Columbia.
   Wages and employee contributions to health-insurance plans have
been major issues blocking settlement of the contracts with the four
companies' nearly 200,000 employees in 20 states and the District of
Columbia.
   The striking workers include operators, telephone installers and
repairmen, factory workers and some sales and clerical personnel.
All four companies have continued service using management
personnel, but there have been delays for customers seeking some
installation and operator services.
   The tentative CWA-Bell Atlantic agreement calls for an immediate
3 percent pay raise for the 41,000 CWA workers. They would receive
raises of 2\ percent in both the second and final years of the
contract. The CWA workers also would receive a cost-of-living
adjustment in the latter two years of the contract and a
profit-sharing payment in all three years.
   Outside the headquarters of Bell Telephone Co. of Pennsylvania in
Philadelphia, picket Mary Angela Kane said: ``Seven and a half
percent is not much, but it's better than nothing. It'll feed my two
kids.''
   The union agreed to a ``managed care plan'' designed to provide
improved benefits and prevent significant increases for
out-of-pocket health care expenses _ if union workers use health
care providers recommended by Bell Atlantic.
   Bell Atlantic has subsidiaries serving 12.7 million customers. It
has 52,000 workers on strike, including about 11,000 IBEW workers.
   In other developments Thursday:
   _Striking workers carried signs reading ``NYNEX Murderers'' at a
memorial rally for a fellow striker who died Tuesday after falling
off the hood of a car of a non-striking worker the day before. At
the rally outside NYNEX headquarters in White Plains, N.Y., CWA
official Jan Pierce said the union was calling for a ``complete and
independent investigation'' into the death of Edward G. Horgan.
   _New York State Police investigated reports that vandals cut
cables belonging to the strike-plagued New York Telephone Co.,
interrupting telephone service for as many as 5,000 customers. Some
service had been restored by midday.
   _Indiana Bell officials sent striking workers a letter outlining
a contract proposal union negotiators rejected. The company said it
had offered a 5 percent raise in the first year _ including a
one-time bonus _ and 2.25 percent and 2.5 percent increases in the
next two years; plus increases in health benefits, profit-sharing
and retirement plans.

   The stock market remained mixed in subdued
afternoon trading after firming slightly around midday as bonds
recovered from earlier lows.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 4.36 points to
2,683.99 at 3 p.m. EDT. The blue-chip indicator was up 2.46 points
an hour earlier.
   Declining issues narrowly outnumbered advances by about 8 to 7 on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 738 issues down, 642 up and 564

   Volume on the Big Board came to 108 million shares.
   Traders said the market had turned dull and was generally
trendless as players began leaving the market for the weekend. Some
blue-chip issues, including airline stocks, showed a bit of spark
but the broader market lagged.
   Stock prices fell early in response to a weakening bond market
after a Labor Department report that showed consumer inflation rose
0.2 percent in July.
   While the number was in line with expectations, investors focused
on the 0.4 percent rise in the index excluding food and energy, the
most volatile components, analysts said. The data was interpreted as
another indication that the Federal Reserve was unlikely to lower
interest rates.

<HEAD>Wheat, Corn Futures Dip; Beans Gain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat and corn futures prices dipped Friday on
confirmation of large foreign purchases of those grains while
soybean futures closed higher following a private forecast for a
surprisingly small crop.
   The decline in the wheat and corn markets ``was a perfect example
of buy the rumor, sell the fact,'' said William Biedermann, director
of research for Allendale Inc., a futures brokerage in Crystal Lake,
Ill.
   The Agriculture Department said Mexico purchased more than
400,000 metric tons of U.S. corn Thursday and China bought 150,000
metric tons of corn and 100,000 metric tons of wheat, the first U.S.
grain purchases by China in two years.
   Biedermann said the foreign sales had been expected since Aug. 9,
when several grain exporters bought large quantities of futures
contracts, apparently to hedge purchases on the cash market of grain
they planned to sell overseas.
   Soybean prices were buoyed by active cash markets for soybean
meal and oil, and by crop estimates from Memphis, Tenn.-based Sparks
Commodities Inc., a private analytical firm, that were lower than
the government projections issued last week.
   Sparks pegged the U.S soybean crop at 1.84 billion bushels
compared to the USDA's estimate of 1.91 billion, and Sparks pegged
the corn crop at 7.05 billion bushels compared to the USDA's
projected 7.35 billion.
   At the close, wheat was 2 cents to 5 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.92\ a bushel; corn was 1{
cents lower to 1\ cents higher with September at $2.35\ a bushel;
oats were unchanged to 1 cent higher with September at $1.38 a
bushel; soybeans were 5 cents lower to 8 cents higher with August at
$6.16 a bushel.

<HEAD>Occidental, Not Hammer's Foundation, Purchased Art, Records Show</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of Leonardo da Vinci drawings, renamed
after Occidental Petroleum Corp. Chairman Armand Hammer and
represented as part of his foundation's art collection, were
actually bought for $5 million by the oil company, documents in a
shareholders' lawsuit show.
   Books and brochures published by the Armand Hammer Foundation
maintained it had purchased the sketches, renamed the ``Codex
Hammer.''
   However, depositions unsealed Thursday in Delaware Chancery Court
at the request of the Los Angeles Times and the Wall Street Journal
show the 1980 purchase was paid for by Occidental Petroleum. The
Times described extensive donations of Occidental funds to Hammer
charities in the last 10 years.
   Hammer, 91, declined requests for comment.
   The industrialist has an art collection valued at more than $250
million. He has given huge sums to charity, among other things
funding anti-cancer research and helping victims of the Chernobyl
nuclear disaster in the Soviet Union and the war in Afghanistan.
   But the shareholders say in their lawsuit against Hammer,
Occidental, and its board of directors that ostensibly charitable
gifts by Occidental Petroleum are actually designed to glorify
Hammer, and are a waste of corporate funds.
   The suit seeks to block Occidental's commitment of $55 million to
$160 million to build and endow the Armand Hammer Museum of Art and
Cultural Center in Los Angeles.
   Hammer's attorneys contend the directors have acted legally and
in accord with their duty to the corporation in making donations
that promote good will toward Occidental while benefiting society.
   The court records show that from 1982 to this year, Occidental
Petroleum, after votes of its board of directors, gave nearly $33
million to four organizations associated with Hammer _ two of which
bear his name.
   ``I think it clearly is within the discretion of the board of
directors to make those donations,'' said Bruce Kauffman, the
Philadelphia attorney representing Hammer in the case.
   ``It is good for the corporation to be associated with museums,
stopping cancer, world peace,'' Kauffman said in a telephone
interview.
   Hammer did not return a phone call seeking comment Friday.
Kauffman had no direct answer to why Hammer had represented the
purchase of da Vinci sketches as being his foundation's instead of
the company's.
   ``I'm not sufficiently familiar with the details to comment on
that,'' Kauffman said.
   But he said, ``I don't know of any time that Dr. Hammer has tried
to make it look as though he alone was the source of the foundation
money,'' although he said Hammer has donated $45 million of his own
money to the foundation over the years.
   Hammer announced plans for the art museum bearing his name in
1988 after he withdrew a commitment to give his collection to the
Los Angeles County Museum of Art.
   The court records show Hammer withdrew his pledge after
administrators at the county museum balked at his demands to strip
galleries of the names of previous donors and devote an entire
museum wing to Hammer's art. He insisted that no other work could be
displayed with the Hammer collection.
   The museum was ``treating me not as a donor but as somebody that
frankly they could push around,'' Hammer recalled in a deposition,
``and I wasn't going to be pushed around.''
   The records also show that Occidental _ not Hammer or his
foundation _ gave a $2 million gift to the county Museum of Art in
1980 to build a bridge connecting two wings of the museum and an
escalator.
   In a 1980 press release issued by the Armand Hammer Foundation
and in a deposition Hammer gave in Los Angeles in June, Hammer
maintained he had financed the gift himself or through the
foundation.
   But Hammer, in a deposition taken under oath, acknowledged that
was not so after an attorney for dissident shareholder Alan Kahn
showed Hammer records indicating that the money was Occidental's.
   A Securities and Exchange Commission filing obtained separately
indicates that in the event of Hammer's death, Occidental Petroleum
is obligated to continue paying Hammer's salary to the foundation
until February 1998, the Times said.
   Hammer is paid about $2 million yearly in salary and stock
options, but Kauffman said about 95 percent of that is given to
charity.
   Occidental Petroleum records show that it donated $32.8 million
in a seven-year period ending earlier this year to four charities
associated with Hammer. Of those, $5.9 million went directly to the
Armand Hammer Foundation. Another $20 million was given to the
Armand Hammer United World College in New Mexico.
   In 1985, Occidental made $16.3 million in charitable donations,
$13.3 million of it to Hammer-associated organizations. That total
represented 6.33 percent of the total money paid out as dividends to
Occidental shareholders.
   Kauffman said those donations were an effective form of public
relations for Occidental, which does not sell anything directly to
the public and thus has a harder time than many corporations in
promoting itself.
   ``They're helping promote the company as well as helping
society,'' he said.

   A late rally helped push the stock market higher
just before the close today after a fairly quiet, mixed day of
trading.
   The market opened weak in response to a drop in the bond market
after a Labor Department report that showed consumer inflation rose
0.2 percent in July.
   Although the number was in line with expectations, investors
focused on the 0.4 percent rise in the Consumer Price Index
excluding food and energy, the most volatile components, analysts
said.
   The data was interpreted as another indication that the Federal
Reserve was unlikely to lower interest rates.
   The bond market later changed direction, pulling stocks along
with it.
   ``The bond market tells the whole story,'' said Charles Jensen,
chief technical analyst with MKI Securities Corp. ``Stocks followed
along with the reaction of the bond market.''
   Although some blue-chip issues showed strong gains, the market
remained generally trendless with the broader market lagging behind.
   Airline stocks helped push the Dow Jones transportation average
higher. UAL Corp., parent of United Airlines, rose amid news that it
had two new potential bidders. McGraw Hill stock also gained
strongly as speculation resurfaced that Paramount Communications
Inc. was interested in buying the company.

<HEAD>UAL Suitors Reportedly Include Bass, British Airways-Morgan Stanley
Group</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   UAL Corp.'s stock price continued gaining altitude
Friday as speculators bet that suitors which reportedly now include
Texas investor Robert Bass and a team of British Airways PLC and
Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. would engage in a bidding war.
   UAL rose $4.62{ a share at $271 late Friday on the New York Stock
Exchange. That followed a gain of $14.62{ on Thursday and more than
$90 a share overall since a buyout proposal by California investor
Marvin Davis was disclosed some two weeks ago.
   ``My guess is that the interest ranges from very serious on the
part of some firms to others who are just exploring the feasibility
of getting involved,'' said Robert Decker, airline analyst for Duff
&amp; Phelps.
   ``Other than Davis' bid, there isn't enough information out there
to make an educated guess. But it's my sense that we're approaching
the upper limits of what anybody is going to pay for the company,''
he said.
   Davis on Wednesday sweetened his proposal to $6.19 billion, or
$275 a share, from the initial $5.4 billion, or $240 a share and has
indicated he might be willing to go even higher after reviewing
internal company data.
   UAL's directors met Thursday and later stated it was premature to
decide whether the company would be sold.
   UAL confirmed it had been contacted by other potential bidders
and had held discussions with an employee group, but declined to
identify any of the parties.
   In addition to Bass and British Airways-Morgan Stanley, Pan Am
Corp. has stated it was interested in a possible merger with UAL,
the parent of United Airlines.
   Also said to be eyeing UAL are the United unit of the Air Line
Pilots Association, which represents United's 7,125 pilots and
offered unsuccessfully to buy the company in 1987; and Chairman
Stephen Wolf, who reportedl is exploring a bid by current UAL
management, possibly in conjunction with the pilots.
   All of the groups declined to comment Friday, citing policies
regarding speculative reports.
   United spokeswoman Sara Dornacker said the company would not
expand on its comments made after the board meeting Thursday,
although she said the directors' next regularly scheduled meeting
was Sept. 27.
   In a statement issued early Friday, Davis said he and his
associates were awaiting ``with interest the board's conclusions and
continue to look forward to working with UAL's board, management and
labor groups to develop a transaction that works to the benefit of
all parties concerned.''
   ``My guess is that they're buying time to continue with their own
analysis of what UAL is worth,'' said Decker. ``Once they get that
completed, they'll be in better position to decide who they talk
with and about how much.''
   Decker also said the pilots' union likely was being courted _ or
would be _ by any group with serious designs on acquiring UAL.
   ``It's improbable any deal could be done without some form of
cooperation from the pilots, and probably the machinists as well,''
he said. ``It may not come down to a share of ownership _ though
that's possible _ but any acquirer would have a hard time getting
financing without some promise of cooperation.
   ``That gives lenders comfort that they won't be facing a
strike,'' he said.

   Amoco Oil Co. is preparing to offer a guarantee to
motorists, contending that its expensive Ultimate Premium gasoline
won't damage a car's fuel system.
   The oil company says this will be the only gasoline with its own
written guarantee, but critics say it's not much of a bargain.
   ``Gasolines typically don't cause problems unless, for instance,
water gets in the fuel tank,'' said Charles Sherwood, a Ford Motor
Co. product design engineer.
   Amoco said that beginning Monday it will reimburse car owners for
repairs of any fuel system damage caused by gasoline in which the
owner has used Ultimate Premium regularly in a new car. The
guarantee is good through the first 75,000 miles of operation or
until the car is sold or contract terminated for leased cars.
   The guarantee applies to cars, vans, light trucks or light-duty
four-wheel-drive vehicles, and covers repairs to such parts as fuel
injectors, carburetors, intake valves and ports, intake manifold,
fuel pump, fuel injection pump, fuel regulator, fuel rail, fuel
lines and fuel tank sending unit.
   Owners and lessees can register for the guarantee on forms
available in Amoco stations.
   Amoco Ultimate has a detergent additive.

<HEAD>Two `Hard Landings' at Eastern Due to New Pilots, ALPA Charges</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-UAL, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unsafe landings occurred on two Eastern Airlines
flights recently because of inexperienced pilots hired to replace
strikers, the Air Line Pilots Association contended Friday. But both
Eastern and the federal agency responsible for air safety disputed
the claims.
   The union representing pilots at most major U.S. airlines said
the incidents involved ``hard landings'' at airports in Atlanta and
Chicago. The airplanes were damaged in both cases but there were no
injuries, the pilots union said.
   A spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration said the
Chicago incident, in which a tail cone fell off, didn't involve a
hard landing but was due to a mechanical malfunction.
   In the Atlanta case, Eastern performed the required inspection
after the hard landing, replaced the affected parts and put the
plane back into service, said the spokesman, Fred Farrar.
   ``These are not inexperienced pilots,'' Farrar said from
Washington.
   He said the FAA's information on the incidents was based on
reports made by Eastern.
   Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak in Miami confirmed that the
incidents occurred, but said they were not caused by the pilots
being unseasoned. The Chicago incident resulted from a mechanical
problem and was not a hard landing, while the hard landing in
Atlanta apparently was due to weather conditions or the jet being
overweight, she said.
   ``Inexperienced pilots were not a factor,'' Ms. Ceremsak said.
``This is another example of the pilots attempting to string
unrelated incidents together to further their cause.''
   The pilots association made the charges in a statement released
from Washington, where its executive council is considering calling
for a nationwide suspension of service on virtually all domestic
carriers to show support for Eastern's strikers.
   The pilots union struck Eastern on March 4 in sympathy with a
walkout by the Machinists union. But veteran pilots by the dozens
crossed picket lines last week and Eastern last Friday said it had
stopped hiring new pilots or taking strikers back.
   Of the four pilots involved in the two incidents, three were
hired by Eastern since the strike and one had little experience in
the type of aircraft he was flying at the time, the pilots union
said.
   ``While `hard landings' are not unheard of in everyday airline
operations, it is unusual to find two of them involving new-hire
pilots in such a short period of time at the same airline,'' the
statement read. ``These incidents illustrate the ongoing problems
that Eastern has had because of its inexperienced pilot group.''
   The pilots union said its information was obtained from
observation posts and by monitoring radio frequencies at major
airports where Eastern operates.
   In the first incident, on July 29 in Chicago, a McDonnell-Douglas
DC-9 aircraft lost its tail cone because of the impact of a hard
landing, according to the pilots union. The inflatable evacuation
slide also was jarred loose and trailed the plane on the ground as
it taxied to the gate, it said.
   But Farrar and Ms. Ceremsak said the tail cone came off because a
lever attached to it released accidentally. ``There is no evidence
of a hard landing,'' Farrar said, referring to the DC-9 episode.
   The first officer, who was flying the approach, was a new hire,
the pilots union said. It said the captain was an Eastern veteran
but he had spent most of his time at the carrier as an instructor or
in the position of second officer, a non-flying post.
   In the Atlanta incident on Aug. 12, a Lockheed L-1011 jumbo jet
bounced on the runway during a landing attempt, the pilots union
said. The pilots aborted the landing, performed a ``go around'' for
another approach and successfully completed the second attempt, the
union said.
   The captain and the first officer were both new hires, the
statement said.
   The pilots union said the damaged aircraft was still in a hangar.
   Farrar and Ms. Ceremsak disputed that claim, saying the L-1011
sustained no damage and was put back in service after some of the
seals on its landing gear were replaced.

   The dollar slipped in worldwide trading Friday as
dealers cashed in on the currency's dramatic run-up in the previous
session.
   Gold prices were mixed. On the Commodity Exchange in New York,
gold bullion for current delivery lost 20 cents to finish at $368.10
a troy ounce. Republic National Bank of New York said gold was bid
later at $366 an ounce, down 20 cents from Thursday.
   Buying interest in the dollar abated following the climb
triggered by Thursday's release of a better-than-expected U.S. trade
report for July, which boosted the U.S. currency to levels not seen
since its most recent rally in June.
   ``The dollar is right back to where we were before the trade
number came out,'' said Michael McDonald, a trader with Harris Trust
&amp; Savings Bank in Chicago.
   A Labor Department report released Friday showed that drops in
energy and clothing prices held the rise in July consumer prices to
just 0.2 percent, a further indication that inflation is restrained.
   But traders characterized the report as a non-event since it was
largely within expectations. ``Most people are anticipating the
(Federal Reserve) will not be easing interest rates in the next week
or two,'' McDonald said.
   With a battery of Japanese government bonds due to mature next
week, traders were speculating whether any of that money would flow
to U.S. securities. But the threat of central bank intervention
overseas during the weekend made them reluctant to bid the dollar
higher.
   The dollar held to a narrow range, and trading was active, said
David Ogg, a vice president at Credit Suisse.
   Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 143.52 Japanese yen, up
from 142.32. Later in London, the dollar traded lower at 142.75 yen.
In New York, the dollar closed at 142.60 yen, down from 143.53 yen
on Thursday.
   In London, one British pound cost at cost $1.5655 late Friday,
more expensive for buyers than Thursday's late $1.5590. In New York,
one pound cost $1.5659, more expensive than $1.5605 on Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday
included: 1.9562 West German marks, down from 1.9637; 1.6855 Swiss
francs, down from 1.6925; 6.5955 French francs, down from 6.6280;
1,403.00 Italian lire, down from 1,412.25, and 1.1178 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.1819.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday
included: 1.9555 West German marks, down from 1.9690; 1.6860 Swiss
francs, down from 1.6980; 6.5945 French francs, down from 6.6325;
2.2080 Dutch guilders, down from 2.2190; 1,405.75 Italian lire, down
from 1,412.00, and 1.1787 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1815.
   Gold prices were higher overseas. In London, gold closed at
$366.65 bid a troy ounce, up from $366.35. The Zurich closing price
was a bid $366.75, up from $365.25. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold
closed at $366.50 bid, up from $366.45.
   Silver prices were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery slipped to $5.238 a troy ounce from $5.246 on
Thursday. But in London the metal traded at a late bid price of
$5.25 a troy ounce, up from $5.20.

<HEAD>Hatch Alleges Fraud In Stock Trades By Two North Dakota Men</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two North Dakota men have made fraudulent stock
transactions which resulted in losses of nearly $200,000 to Twin
Cities area brokers, Minnesota Commerce Commissioner Michael Hatch
alleged Friday.
   Hatch alleged in cease-and-desist orders that Ryan Westgard and
Darrell Adams, both of Grand Forks, N.D., since May have made
numerous stock and stock option purchases on credit and then
defaulted.
   Westgard and Adams appeared to be acting with other parties,
Hatch alleged, and he said total losses could exceed $400,000.
   Adams did not immediately return a reporter's telephone call for
comment, and there was no response to calls made to Westgard's
residence Friday afternoon.
   Hatch's orders list Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., John G. Kinnard
&amp; Co. Inc., Craig-Hallum Inc., Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. and
L'Argent Securities Inc. as brokers who have lost money because of
the men's trades.
   So far, he said, it appears that all of the transactions involved
the purchase of USX Corp. common stock, USX Corp. common stock
options or Angeion common stock.
   The orders prohibit Westgard and Adams from engaging in such
transactions or any other activities that violate Minnesota or
federal securities statutes.
   Hatch said his investigation is continuing and further orders may
be issued. The Securities and Exchange Commission also has been
contacted, he said.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Narrowly Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices finished mixed Friday as buying by
bargain-hunters offset the early prices declines that followed the
latest consumer inflation report.
   Prices of long-term Treasury and corporate bonds edged up, but
prices of shorter-term Treasury issues and tax-exempt bonds slipped.
   The price of the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose 1-16
point, or less than $1 for every $1,000 in face value, as its yield
dipped to 8.15 percent from 8.16 percent late Thursday.
   Prices fell after the Labor Department reported that its Consumer
Price Index rose 0.2 percent in July. While that increase was widely
expected, some traders were disappointed by a 0.4 percent rise in
prices other than for food and energy. That increase was up from a
0.3 percent increase in June.
   Kevin Flanagan, money market economist for Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc., said that while the report was ``nothing alarming, the market
was being skittish.''
   He said any indication that inflation is accelerating encourages
speculation that the Federal Reserve will not soon relax its credit
policy.
   He said there were also concerns that brokerage houses that
bought Treasury issues auctioned last week were still trying to find
buyers for the securities.
   But Flanagan said prices moved higher later in the day,
recovering most of the day's lost ground as buyers emerged at the
higher yields.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
issues lost [ point, intermediate securities fell 3-32 point and
long-term issues rose as much as 3-32 point, according to figures
provided by Telerate Inc., a financial information service.
   The movement of a point equals a change of $10 in the price of a
bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, fell 0.72 to 1,177.36.
   Corporate bonds prices edged up. Moody's Investment Grade
Corporate Bond Index, which measures total return on a portfolio of
80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, rose
0.22 to 328.25.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds fell [ point. The average yield to maturity
rose to 7.32 percent from 7.31 percent late Thursday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 8.09 percent as the
discount dropped 5 basis points to 7.83 percent. Yields on six-month
bills rose to 8.28 percent as the discount rose 1 basis point to
7.85 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 8.30 percent as the
discount rose 2 basis points to 7.73 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted at 8~ percent, unchanged from late Thursday.

   The stock market closed higher Friday, ending
with a rally after a relatively quiet session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 8.34 points to
finish at 2,687.97, a gain of 3.98 points on the week.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7 to 6 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
776 issues up, 661 down and 544 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board totaled 145.81 million
shares, down from 157.56 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 174.245 million shares.
   Stocks opened weaker in response to a slide in the bond market
after a Labor Department report on consumer prices that raised
concern about the inflation outlook over the next few months.
   The Labor Department's Consumer Price Index rose 0.2 percent in
July, in line with the market consensus.
   ``People felt that since it was in line with expectations, the
Fed wouldn't have to ease credit at the present time,'' said Brad
Weeks, head of equity trading at the investment firm of Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette.
   But without food and energy costs, the most volatile components
of the index, consumer prices rose a heftier 0.4 percent, raising
inflation worries.
   ``The report looks good on the surface but when you read further
in there is concern that we have seen the lows in inflation and will
be moving higher in the months ahead,'' said James Solloway,
economist with Argus Research Corp.
   Stocks firmed slightly at midday as bonds turned higher and by
late afternoon prices were strengthening.
   But uncertainty about the impact of the the so-called ``double
witching hour'' _ the expiration of stock-index futures and options
that don't expire quarterly _ dampened the rally.
   Volume remained low throughout the session with computerized
program strategies dominating most of the activity, said Weeks.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market gained $12.033 billion, or 0.36
percent, in value from Thursday.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added
0.69 to 192.64.
   Among actively traded issues on the NYSE, UAL Corp. rose 4| to
271 amid reports that the company had drawn two more potential
bidders. McGraw Hill gained 6 to 85{ on renewed speculation that
Paramount Communications Inc. might make a bid for the company.
   Texas Utilities rose [ to 32], Maytag advanced 1} to 23\ and
General Electric gained \ to 58.
   Meanwhile, Philip Morris closed down 1{ at 156{, Navistar fell [
to 4} and Exxon remained unchanged at 43}.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 1.57 to 395.84, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index went up 1.58 to 346.03.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
finished at 461.97, 1.14 higher. At the American Stock Exchange, the
market value index closed at 379.18, up 0.84.

<TEXT>
   Oil futures ended a lackluster week by finishing
mixed Friday, with no major developments to influence prices.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the September contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, rose
12 cents to close at $18.80 per 42-gallon barrel. Contract months
for later delivery were narrowly mixed.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, unleaded regular
gasoline for September delivery edged up 0.38 cent to 52.73 cents a
gallon.
   Heating oil futures for September slipped 0.01 cent lower,
settling at 51.03 cents a gallon.
   Analysts said the market was driven mainly by technical factors
in the absence of news on oil supplies or production.
   ``It just fits into technical wiggle and jiggle,'' said Peter
Beutel, assistant director of the energy group at Elders Futures Inc.
   The oil market has been in the summer doldrums for some time.
Traders are looking forward to Labor Day for a pickup in activity
and beyond that to the next scheduled meeting, on Sept. 23, of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.

<HEAD>Copper Futures Rally Ends On Profit-Taking and Easing Tensions in
Peru</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Profit-taking put an end to a seven-day runup in copper futures
prices Friday on New York's Commodity Exchange but chart-watchers
said technical signals pointed toward further gains.
   ``This might actually help,'' analyst Stephen Platt, of Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc., said of the moderately steep decline. He said
the market had fallen back to prices it had skipped over on its way
up and cited a theory that markets must fill such gaps before
resuming a trend.
   On other futures markets Friday, precious metals retreated while
futures prices for energy, grains, soybeans, livestock and meat were
mixed.
   Copper settled 1.50 cents to 2.35 cents lower with the contract
for spot delivery at $1.2465 a pound and the more actively traded
September contract at $1.2390.
   Spot prices had climbed as high as $1.2680 on Thursday, which
represented a gain of more than 15 percent since Aug. 8.
   The rally had been linked to indications that production
problems, including ongoing miner strikes in Canada and Peru, were
beginning to make a dent in copper stockpiles.
   Analysts said Friday's decline was largely a due to pre-weekend
profit-taking after the nearly vertical run-up.
   Platt said prospects for a settlement of the 5-day-old Peruvian
strike appeared to be improving. He said the miners must return to
work to qualify for wage bonuses and some observers believe those
bonuses are enough incentive to bring the strike to an end.
   But both Platt and Peter Cardillo, commodities trading adviser
with Josephthal &amp; Co., said the market continued to look strong from
a technical perspective.
   Gold and silver futures prices fell slightly on the Comex in
response to the Labor Department's report of a modest 0.2 percent
rise in consumer prices last month.
   Low inflation rates or falling prices tend to discourage investor
buying of precious metals.
   Gold settled 20 cents to 70 cents lower with August at $368.10 a
troy ounce; silver was .08 cent to 1 cent lower with September at
$5.255 a troy ounce.
   Wheat and corn futures prices retreated on confirmation of large
foreign purchases of those grains while soybean futures closed
higher following a private forecast for a surprisingly small crop.
   Memphis-based Sparks Commodities Inc. pegged the U.S soybean crop
at 1.84 billion bushels compared to the Agriculture Department's
estimate last week of 1.91 billion, and Sparks pegged the corn crop
at 7.05 billion bushels compared to the USDA's projected 7.35
billion.
   Wheat settled 1{ cents to 5 cents lower with September at $3.92\
a bushel; corn was unchanged to 1\ cents lower with September at
$2.34} a bushel; oats were unchanged to 1\ cents higher with
September at $1.38\ a bushel; soybeans were 4\ cents lower to 7}
cents higher with August at $6.15} a bushel.
   Reports of a gasoline refinery shutdown in Venezuela boosted
gasoline futures prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Crude
oil futures were mixed and heating oil was lower.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 4 cents lower to 12
cents higher with September at $18.80 a barrel; heating oil was .01
cent to .07 cent lower with September at 51.03 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .15 cent lower to .38 cent higher with
September at 52.73 cents a gallon.
   Livestock and meat futures were narrowly mixed on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, where the August contracts for live cattle and
hogs expired Friday. August live cattle finished 2 cents higher at
73.97 cents a pound; August hogs ended .90 cent higher at 48.75
cents a pound.
   Other live cattle contracts settled .08 cent lower to .20 cent
higher with September at 74.75 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .08
cent lower to .18 cent higher with August at 84.57 cents a pound;
hogs were .15 cent lower to .40 cent higher with October at 41.05
cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were unchanged to .40 cent higher
with August at 27.17 cents a pound.

   A decrease in orders for heavy-duty truck
engines has forced Cummins Engine Co. to lay off about 100
production workers at its Indiana plants, the company announced
Friday.
   The layoffs, effective Aug. 28, will affect workers at Cummins
plants in Columbus, Indianapolis, Seymour and Madison, said Ann C.
Smith, a Cummins spokeswoman.
   The company also blamed the layoffs on production adjustments by
some of its customers. Cummins produces diesel engines, components
and power systems.
   The founding family of the Columbus-based, worldwide engine-maker
staged a major stock purchase last month to insulate Cummins from a
possible takeover.
   J. Irwin Miller, the company's board chairman, and members of his
family paid about $72 million to buy back 8.8 percent of Cummins
stock held by the U.S. arm of British conglomerate Hanson PLC.
   Nine days later, Industrial Equity (Pacific) Ltd., a Hong
Kong-based investiment concerned, filed notice with the Securities
and Exchange Commission that it acquired 9.9 percent of Cummins.
   Cummins officials have said IEP's holdings would not generate the
concern among shareholders that Hanson's did.
   Cummins employs 26,100 employees worldwide.

<HEAD>Charge It and Save Money: Brazilian Credit Card Industry Thriving</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserGraphic planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TODD LEWAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Credit card use is booming in
Brazil because of hyper-inflation, which makes it worthwhile for
shoppers to buy now and pay later.
   Consumers are using plastic to pay for everything from newspapers
and samba dance classes to ritual voodoo costumes, as a way to beat
the merry-go-round of price hikes.
   Because there's no finance charge if bills are paid promptly at
the end of the month, shopping by credit card in effect can lock in
prices that prevailed at the time purchases were made.
   A year ago, 3.6 million credit cards were circulating in the
country of 145 million people, industry figures show. Today there
are 6.2 million, and card marketing directors predict the number
will quintuple by 1993.
   ``You're looking at the hottest market in the services sector in
Brazil today,'' said Paulo Veras Bica, director of Banco Nacional's
Visa card.
   Foreign card companies are scrambling to exploit the demand,
foreseeing a continuous growth in the buying power of Brazilian
consumers despite the country's staggering economic problems.
   Mastercard, which in Brazil is associated with Credicard,
Brazil's most popular card with 2.2 million users, has more than
doubled its number of card-holders in the last two years.
   American Express card membership rose to 480,000 in June, a 30
percent increase since 1987. Diners Club saw its clientele triple in
two years, to 300,000 in July.
   Visa associated with two of Brazil's largest commercial banks,
Banco do Brasil and Banco Nacional, and gained nearly 1 million
clients since last year.
   ``We were just another card that belonged to a bank and we were
fading into the sunset. Associating ourselves with Visa gave us
prestige, validity and credibility,'' said Bica, Banco Nacional's
credit director.
   In return, Visa is benefiting from an influx of foreign tourists,
who find more Brazilian merchants willing to accept cards. The
company looks forward to the day when the government allows
Brazilians to use cards abroad, a practice now prohibited as a way
of protecting Brazil's foreign currency reserves.
   ``Visa is gambling that soon Brazilians will be able to use their
cards when they travel,'' said Ruben Osta, Finance Director for
Banco Nacional's Visa card. ``They want to be here first when the
government gives the go-ahead.''
   Brazilians are not yet as addicted to plastic money as American
cardholders, who pack an average of eight cards. But that too is
changing rapidly.
   ``Brazilians are going through a change in culture,'' said Marcio
Souza, director for the Bradesco bank's credit card, the No. 2 card
in Brazil with 1.85 million clients.
   ``These days, credit cards are more than a buying tool or a means
of getting a loan _ they're becoming a business and social
credential.''
   A shift in banking practices underlies the trend. Checks, the
predominant form of payment during the last decade, are
relinquishing ground to automated credit transactions because banks
are reducing paperwork and costs.
   Security, convenience, and incentives such as 24-hour
computerized tellers and instant access to bank accounts also are
winning new members.
   ``Brazil is entering the modern age of banking and consuming,''
said Jean Rozwadowski, who heads the Brazilian operations of
American Express.
   ``There is a tremendous upsurge in card usage,'' says Osta, of
Banco Nacional.
   Unprecedented marketing drives are spreading plastic to far-off
rural regions.
   ``It's not easy convincing shop owners in jungle or mining towns
why they should accept a card instead of cash or gold,'' says Sergio
Machado, credit card director at Banco do Brasil, a
government-controlled commercial bank, South America's largest.
``But we're doing it.''
   Machado said more than 75 percent of Brazilian cities with
populations under 500,000 now accept the Banco do Brasil-Visa card,
called Ourocard or ``Gold Card.''
   Not even a dip in workers' buying clout and a deep economic
decline last year daunt the expectations of card companies.
   ``The underground economy makes up at least 40 percent of the
total economy,'' said Bica. ``And as it grows, people will have more
and more disposable income on the side to spend.''
   Nonetheless, there is concern that the country's relentless
inflation rate could boomerang on the credit-card issuers. In July
alone the cost of living rose 28.76 percent, and August inflation is
expected to be even higher. Computed over the last 12 months, annual
inflation averages 1,000 percent.
   Some merchants have taken matters into their own hands by
boycotting credit cards because of delayed reimbursement by card
issuers. Others have begun charging card customers 45 percent more
than cash-paying clients, a practice that is illegal but growing.
   ``Credit cards are supposed to be cash payment,'' complained
Denise Neueschwander, 34, a Rio housewife. ``But no one seems to
know that here.''
   Some critics warn that turning Brazil into a credit card society
could fuel inflation even more, and eventually compel the government
to take drastic measures to curb their use, which could help incite
a recession.
   But marketing directors dismiss the notion.
   ``It's a fantastic future market,'' said Marcos Vinicius Araujo,
spokesman for Credicard. ``We're not worried.''

<HEAD>Savings Certificates Use Gimmicks To Lure Depositors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN SCHWARTZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Free toasters are history. Today's banks
offer thrills, excitement and chance to prospective depositors.
   Support your favorite baseball team. Take a chance on the
weather. Help an environmental cause. These are among the gimmicks
banks are using to lure new accounts.
   Fleet National Bank, based in Providence, has offered
certificates of deposit that encourage customers to ``put your money
where your mouth is'' by investing in a CD with an interest rate
that increases each time either the Red Sox or Yankees win.
   A New Hampshire bank offers a CD with an interest rate that
varies with the daily temerature.
   ``From a competitors point of view, it's easier just to hike a
rate,'' said Tom Howe, Fleet's senior vice president in products and
services.
   But the ``more creative type of deposit strategy _ one that
generates more enthusiasm and interest,'' helps broadens the market
by targeting unconventional CD depositors, he said.
   The method appears to work. Fleet has offered sports CDs since
1986, when the Boston Celtics were seeking their 16th NBA
championship.
   ``We've been quite pleased with the results,'' said Howe.
   The trick was to guess the number of points the Celtics would
score in the final game. Those who guessed correctly saw their CD
jump to 16 percent from 7 percent for the full three-month term.
   When Providence College took on the University of Rhode Island at
basketball in 1987, the bank capitalized on a long-standing feud by
offering a CD with an interest rate that increased one-twentieth of
1 percent for every game the customer's chosen team won.
   Fleet continued the sports tradition with a ``Home Team'' CD
offered last fall in which the interest rate rose each time the
Boston Bruins or Boston Celtics won a home game.
   This year Fleet reoffered a baseball CD geared to the Yankees-Red
Sox rivalry. Only available before the teams met for the first time
June 8, the CD increases one-tenth of 1 percent from then on each
time the customer's chosen team wins.
   If the chosen team wins the American League Championship, the CD
would receive a 1 percent bonus on the total deposit.
   The Rhode Island State Police, responsible for enforcing the
state's anti-gambling laws, say they have investigated the sports
CDs and determined they are legal.
   ``You are really not gambling,'' said Sgt. Terrance Burgess of
internal affairs. `They are gong to give out a flat CD rate anyway
so the element of chance, if it's there, is almost non-existent. You
can't lose.''
   The baseball CD required a $1,000 minimum deposit and offered a
fixed rate of 9\ percent for a six-month deposit.
   Howe would not say how many sports CDs have been taken out.
   ``I think the fact that the bank has offered multiple sports CDs
suggests that they are well recieved by the Rhode Island public,''
he said.
   Rhode Islanders aren't the only ones who have welcomed the
innovation. Lincoln Savings Bank in New York, for example, offered a
similar CD based on the Yankees and Mets.
   New Hampshire's Cheshire County Savings Bank offered a ``Heat
Wave'' CD so unusual it took more than a month to catch on.
   The interest rate on the three-month CD is 10 percent of whatever
the day's high is in Concord, N.H. After October, the rates will be
based on the temperature in Orlando, Fla.
   If the temperature is a record high for the day, the CD would
increase a half a percent more, said Elizabeth Colby, a customer
service representative at Cheshire. The rate is guaranteed not to
drop below 7.5 percent and has peaked at 9.75 percent since it began
July 11.
   ``It took a little while for people to see what it's all about,''
she said. ``It's picking up.''
   The CD, which requires a $500 minimum deposit, appeals to young
people, partly because of the low investment and also because of the
unusual terms, she said.
   ``Older people are more apt to want a fixed interest rate,'' said
Colby. ``Younger people tend to gamble a little more.''
   Fleet targeted another market with a CD it offered in the
aftermath of an oil spill off the coast of Newport, R.I., earlier
this summer, agreeing to donate to Save the Bay $1 per $1,000
deposited up to a maximum of $50,000.
   ``The oil spill in the bay obviously increased the awareness of
most Rhode Islanders to the environment,'' said Howe. ``So we felt
the timing of this product was really good.''

<HEAD>Provincetown Boston Airlines Suit Settled</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An out-of-court settlement has been approved by a
federal court judge giving $2.4 million to former shareholders of
Provincetown Boston Airlines, which declared bankruptcy in 1985.
   Once the nation's largest commuter carrier, PBA is now operated
by Continental Airlines.
   A class-action suit was filed against the airline by shareholders
citing PBA's failure to disclose a long-standing investigation of
the airline by the Federal Aviation Administration.
   ``According to federal securities laws, an investor must be given
all of the necessary information to make an intelligent decision and
this obviously was not the case here,'' said Jeffrey Herrmann, a
Saddle Brook, N.J., attorney who represented the shareholders in the
4{-year-old suit.
   ``I'm delighted that the shareholders received a return on their
investment and in most cases, a complete recovery of the damages
they suffered as a result of the defendant's action,'' Herrmann said.
   PBA ran into troubles during a rapid expansion in the mid-1980s,
most notably two fatal air crashes in Boston Harbor and Florida.
   U.S. District Court Judge Charles E. Stewart Jr. approved the
settlement.

<HEAD>Say American Efforts to Buy Eastern Assets on Hold</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Airlines said Friday that
negotiations have lapsed in its attempt to buy routes and other
property for sale by Eastern Airlines, which is undergoing
bankruptcy reorganization because of a strike.
   ``As far as we know, discussions are in abeyance. Things change
so much we're not exactly sure what they're trying to sell,'' said
American spokeswoman Mary O'Neill.
   Discussions had been on-and-off, she said, but ``we got the
indication that they weren't looking to sell.''
   Miami-based Eastern had expressed interest in selling airport
property and its South American routes as part of a profound
restructuring to re-emerge from bankruptcy as a smaller airline.
   Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak in Miami said, ``There has
been no final decision to sell South America, and to the extent that
there have been discussions, we would not want to comment.''
   Eastern President Phil Bakes told The Associated Press the
carrier will be selling fewer assets than anticipated when it first
began trying to come back from its March 4 strike and subsequent
Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.
   Bakes wouldn't go into details on the South American route
negotiations and said he didn't ``want to set odds'' on whether they
would be sold.
   ``We will have more employees, it will service more cities and
we'll have more airplanes,'' Bakes said in an interview.
   Eastern at first said it would need to sell $1.8 billion in
assets, but Bakes on Wednesday trimmed that estimate to $1.5 billion.

<TEXT>
   Striking Eastern Airlines workers, making a
3,000-mile ``Journey for Justice'' to dramatize their plight, were
greeted by brewery workers Friday during a rally on the edge of a
south Georgia pecan orchard.
   About 28 pilots, flight attendants and machinists stopped in
Albany to gather donations and collect signatures for a petition
that asks President Bush to appoint a trustee to run the troubled
airline.
   ``Bush goes to Poland and embraces the labor leaders over there,
yet he won't give us the time of day,'' said pilot Buddy Davison of
Baytown, Texas. ``Our goal is to get a trustee appointed to get the
airline and the workers back to work.''
   The Eastern workers inflated a blue and white hot-air ballon with
pro-union messages, sold T-shirts to bolster strike funds and passed
out bumper stickers during their Albany rally.
   About 30 workers from the nearby Miller Brewing Co. plant joined
them in a hot, dusty field. The brewery workers are members of Local
2699 of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace
Workers, the same union that represents Eastern machinists.
   The airline's machinists went on strike March 4, and most of the
its pilots and flight attendants decided not to cross their picket
lines.
   Davison said the main issue in the dispute is Frank Lorenzo,
chairman of Texas Air Corp., which owns Eastern and sister carrier
Continental Airlines. Davison contended Lorenzo is trying to destroy
the unions and dismantle Eastern by selling off its assets.
   The ``Journey for Justice'' began Saturday at Eastern's
headquarters in Miami. Traveling in cars and motorhomes, their
motorcade will make numerous stops enroute to New York City and
Washington, D.C.

<HEAD>Husky Oil, Two Partners Enter Agreement With Libya</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CALGARY (AP) </DATELINE>

   Husky Oil Ltd. and two partners have signed an oil
production sharing agreement with Libya.
   The three, including OMV Exploration and Production Ltd. of
Austria and Petrobras International SA, an arm of Brazil's state oil
company, have committed $100 million to the venture, Husky said.
   Jamie Blair, Husky International president, said Thursday his
firm's share of the transaction will cost $35 million.
   Husky said the three exploration and production sharing
agreements with the National Oil Corp. of Libya cover five on-shore
exploration blocks in the Sirte and Ghadames Basins.
   The program includes 14 wells.
   ``Both basins already have oil production,'' Blair said. ``We
think the potential of these prospects is significant to Husky as a
company.''
   About 20 years after it nationalized foreign oil holdings, the
Libyan government faces severely reduced reserves.
   Libya now cannot produce enough oil to fill the production quota
assigned to it by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.

<HEAD>GE's Lynn Plant Wins Navy Contract</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Navy said Friday that General Electric Co.
won a heated competition with Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Co. to
produce engines for F-A18 Hornet jets. GE estimated the eventual
value of the contract at up to $2 billion.
   The Navy placed an immediate order for 132 of the F-404 turbofan
engines, which are assembled at GE's plant in Lynn. In addition, the
Navy said GE would be the ``sole source'' for all additional
purchases of the engines, a status GE had enjoyed until 1984.
   In an unusual move five years ago, the Defense Department forced
GE to turn over plans for the F-404 engines to Pratt &amp; Whitney in an
effort to stimulate competition and reduce costs.
   Since then, Pratt &amp; Whitney, a division of United Technologies
Corp. of Hartford, Conn., has been a second source of the engines,
which cost between $1 million and $2 million apiece.
   In Lynn, where GE has eliminated 4,300 jobs over the past 2{
years, there was ``a great deal of relief and happiness'' Friday,
said company spokesman Robert N. Salvucci.
   Salvucci said 1,500 employees have been working on the engines,
and 100 to 150 more workers will be added in the second quarter of
1990 because of the Navy's decision.
   The F-A18, a carrier-based fighter and attack jet, is used by the
Canadian, Australian and Spanish air forces as well as the U.S. Navy
and Marines. It has also recently been selected by the governments
of Switzerland and Kuwait.
   Pratt &amp; Whitney said the Navy's decision would have no immediate
impact on employment in Hartford, because the company has a backlog
of orders that will last into 1991. Pratt &amp; Whitney spokesman
Brayton Harris said the company would not speculate on the eventual
impact.

   A 3-week-old labor dispute ended Friday
after the governor of Tamaulipas negotiated an agreement between
rival union factions, the director of a business organization said.
   The resolution means the northeastern state of Tamaulipas will
have its first major labor union independent of the powerful Mexican
Labor Federation, or CTM.
   ``The (strike) flags are coming down right at this moment,'' Mike
Allen, executive director of the McAllen Economic Development Corp.,
said Friday afternoon. McAllen, Texas, is across the Rio Grande from
Reynosa.
   Allen did not provide details on how the agreement was reached.
The governor's office was unavailable for comment immediately.
   The strike pit the head of the local union, Abel Hernandez,
against the CTM. After Hernandez pulled the local union out of the
CTM, the local CTM leader, Rafael Morales, called the strike on July
25 and declared himself head of the local.
   The labor board, controlled by the CTM, then authorized Morales
as union leader.
   Allen said the agreement was a victory for Hernandez, but he did
not elaborate.
   The strike closed 15 plants, idled 2,000 workers and cost the
plants about $500,000 a day in lost production.
   Tamaulipas Gov. Americo Villareal held a marathon round of
meetings with plant managers, rival union factions and business
leaders Thursday and Friday before resolving the stalemate.
   ``The governor of the state of Tamaulipas deserves alot of
credit,'' Allen said in a telephone interview ``He said enough of
this corruption. He took a very positive stand and negotiated this.''
   The CTM is the nation's largest and most-powerful labor
organization and is a pillar of the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party.
   At least 800 workers of the 2,000 affected by the strike rebelled
against Morales on Tuesday, ripping down the strike flags, returning
to work and locking themselves inside their plants.
   Plant managers had refused to sign contracts with Morales, whom
they accuse of corruption.
   At least two plants have threatened to pull out of Mexico.
   ``U.S. industries that have projects planned have put them on
hold and are watching the situation very closely,'' Linda Brown, a
spokeswoman for the McAllen Economic Development Corp., said earlier.
   In Mexico, the National Council of Foreign Commerce, a private
business group in Monterrey, called on President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari to intervene before the strike discouraged new investment.
   ``This conflict is affecting Mexico's image and putting in risk
the consideration of foriegn investors who bring their capital to
Mexico,'' Guillermo Diaz de la Garza, the council's director
general, said in a statement.
   The manager of one plant said Morales forces companies to give
the CTM control of trucking contracts, transportation of waste and
even food coupons so that workers have to buy food from stores he
controls.
   The workers say they have no obligation under Mexican labor law
to sign with the CTM and, in fact, are happy with Hernandez no
matter who he represents.
   The foreign-owned maquiladora plants take advantage of Mexico's
lower labor costs to assemble products for export to the United
States. The maquiladora industry is a key source of jobs and
investment for Mexico.

<HEAD>Disney President Makes $74 Million on Stock Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BURBANK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president and chief operating officer
of Walt Disney Co. made a $74.2 million profit in July by selling
shares he purchased six months earlier under the company's stock
option plan.
   The sale by Frank G. Wells, revealed in a filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, was done in part because Wells
``wanted to do some estate planning,'' Disney spokesman Erwin Okun
said Friday.
   ``He has no plans to leave,'' Okun said. ``He's highly optimistic
about the long-range prospects, and he recently signed a contract
through 1994.''
   Okun said Wells made a cash purchase of 850,000 Disney shares at
the option exercise price of $14.36 each in January for a total of
$12.2 million. Wells sold the shares on July 18 and July 19 at a
market price of $101.60, or $86.4 million.
   Under the program, he still holds options to buy 42,000 shares at
the same low $14.36. That's the amount, adjusted for a stock split,
the shares were selling for when he joined the company in September
1984.
   Wells' salary this year is $400,000, and he received a $3.7
million bonus in January, an amount determined by the company's net
income.
   And there's more.
   ``In November he gets options on another 369,000 shares under his
contract (at the same $14.36),'' Okun said.
   Last year, Wells' boss, Disney chairman and chief executive
officer Michael D. Eisner, was paid a salary of $750,000 and his
performance-based bonus was $6.8 million.
   But he made a $32.6 million profit on shares purchased and sold
under the option program, and Okun said he has the option of buying
948,143 shares at the low rate. If he exercised the the option and
could sell the shares at Friday's stock price, he would pocket more
than $92 million.
   The year Eisner and Wells signed on with Disney, the company
earned $97.2 million. In the fiscal year that ended Sept. 31, the
earnings had jumped to $522 million.
