   A federal judge rejected Exxon Valdez
skipper Joseph Hazelwood's request to block the state from
prosecuting him on charges stemming from the nation's worst oil
spill.
   U.S. District Judge Andrew Kleinfeld said Friday it would be
inappropriate for him to determine the scope of a federal immunity
provision under which Hazelwood sought to have his case dismissed.
   Kleinfeld said a state judge should rule on the question of
immunity first.
   Hazlewood claims that because he reported the spill, he is
immune from state felony and misdemeanor charges of recklessness,
negligent discharge of oil and operating a vessel while intoxicated.
   Defense attorney Richard Friedman said virtually every piece of
state's evidence came as a result of a call Hazelwood made to the
Coast Guard, and thus shouldn't be used against Hazelwood.
   ``They knew nothing about the spill until he called,'' Friedman
said.
   But the judge said, ``It seems like a real possibility someone
might have noticed an oil spill the size of Rhode Island whether or
not it was called in.''
   Hazelwood spoke quietly to one of his attorneys during the
proceeding but didn't address the court. The 43-year-old mariner
from Huntington, N.Y., came to Fairbanks because of the possibility
his participation would be needed, said Dick Madson, one of his
attorneys.
   Exxon fired Hazelwood from his captain's job soon after the
Valdez struck a reef in Prince William Sound on March 24 and
spilled nearly 11 million gallons of oil.
   Hazelwood has filed the same claim of immunity in state court,
where a hearing is scheduled Nov. 29.

<HEAD>Bush Gives Tentative OK to Pay Raise with Honoraria Reform</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush's support of a pay raise for
top government officials and members of Congress returns it to the
forefront just eight months after lawmakers were scorched by public
backlash on the issue.
   House leaders have been busy behind the scenes trying to arrange
a pay increase coupled with ethics reforms, hoping to get it
accomplished this year before lawmakers become too wary with
re-election concerns.
   Bush's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said Friday that the
president would support any ``reasonable proposal.''
   One congressional source, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the latest version included an 8 percent ``cost-of-living''
raise in January for members of Congress and senior officials in
the other two government branches.
   Salaries would jump another 25 percent in January 1991, just
after next year's elections, matching the amount Bush asked for
earlier this year for judges and the executive branch.
   At that point, congressional pay would reach about $121,000 and
the ethics package would ban lawmakers from earning any money from
speaking fees.
   Fitzwater said Bush wants any pay raise tied to ethical
standards that would prohibit lawmakers from accepting honoraria.
   Senate and House members currently earn $89,500. In the House,
members are allowed to keep speaking fees totalling 30 percent of
their salaries; senators may keep 40 percent.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., has said the president's
endorsement was critical to any pay-raise effort. Foley and House
Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., met with Bush on Wednesday
to press the issue.
   The president ``wanted to make absolutely sure that ... on the
ethics side, that our package was pretty consistent with what he
had proposed and I think it is,'' Michel said.
   But, Michel said, that hardly made a pay increase certain.
   ``House members aren't all that far away from where the
executive branch might be,'' Michel said. ``Our problem area is
with the Senate, quite frankly.''
   ``If the president endorses it, and the Democratic and
Republican leadership go forward holding hands, then maybe they can
do something,'' said Rep. Tim Penny, D-Minn., an outspoken opponent
of the defeated 51 percent pay hike President Ronald Reagan
proposed as he departed office.
   ``But even then, it's a tough sell,'' he said.
   ``I'm not sure that it's going to go anywhere,'' said Rep. Leon
Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the Budget Committee.
   ``Congress doesn't deserve it,'' said Rep. Thomas Tauke, R-Iowa.
``Pay raises are meant to reward a job well done, and that's hardly
a boast this Congress can make.''
   A House bipartisan task force has proposed a 35 percent salary
boost over two years. The plan would also include changes in
Congress' ethics rules, including new restrictions on speaking fees
and other changes, such as preventing members from pocketing
leftover campaign money when they retire from office.
   The large pay raise before Congress earlier this year collapsed
under a barrage of public criticism.

<TEXT>
   Nicaraguan rebels said Friday that
they would not attend a meeting with Sandinista officials at the
United Nations next week and proposed it be postponed a week.
President Daniel Ortega asked for a shorter delay and that Honduran
officials take part.
   Honduras late Friday reiterated its refusal and said the rebels
were Nicaragua's problem. ``Honduras will not attend any event of
that nature,'' Foreign Minister Carlos Lopez Contreras said from
Tegucigalpa, the Honduran capital.
   Ortega had requested the talks for Monday and Tuesday after
ending a 19-month truce with the U.S.-backed Contras fighters.
   The Contras instead decided not to attend next week, Wilfredo
Montalvan, a director of the Nicaraguan Resistance, said Friday by
telephone.
   ``The date proposed by Ortega is a strategy of his political
party to take us off-guard,'' Montalvan said. ``That is, he
proposed that date for his convenience. Therefore, we propose that
it be Nov. 13 to be able to prepare ourselves.
   ``And if Ortega thinks the only thing that is going to be
discussed there is the unconditional surrender of our troops, he
should forget that, since he is very wrong,'' he added. ``Our
demobilization is voluntary and will (occur) when you can observe
that Nicaragua is taking true steps toward the route of democracy.''
   Nicaragua called the meeting _ which would be the first direct
talks between the two groups in more than a year _ to discuss
disbanding of the Contras.
   An Aug. 7 peace agreement signed by Ortega and four other
Central American presidents calls for the voluntary demobilization
and relocation of rebels from Honduran camps by Dec. 5. The Contras
were not a party to the agreement and have not agreed to disband.
   The Honduran government said Wednesday that existing peace
accords are sufficient and declined to send representatives to
Ortega's proposed meeting.
   But the Nicaraguan president held out hope Friday for Honduran
participation.
   ``I hope that the government of Honduras, with its indispensable
and valuable participation, contributes to obtaining positive
results in favor of the peace process,'' he said.
   ``Given that the presence of the Honduran government at that
meeting has not been able to be confirmed today, I propose that it
be held Nov. 9 and 10 at the same place for the purpose of
discussing demobilization of the counterrevolutionary forces camped
in Honduras,'' Ortega said in a letter to those invited to the
meeting.
   Ortega, asked if the only topic would be demobilization,
responded: ``Depending on how the demobilization agreement
progresses, we will be willing to reconsider the cease-fire.''
   Nicaragua launched an offensive against the Contras this week
after Ortega ended the truce. He said he took the action because
the Contras had begun returning to Nicaragua from base camps to
which they retreated in 1988.
   Montalvan said any meeting also would take up a general amnesty,
freedom for political prisoners and work out the disbanding process.
   He said he was no longer certain of Adolfo Calero's
particiaption in the meeting, but gave no reasons. Montalvan had
said earlier that Calero, who lives in Miami, would attend as a
political leader with Enrique Bermudez, the military leader.
   Roberto Ferrey, another member of the rebel directorate,
confirmed Bermudez and four other rebel military chiefs would
attend.
   Officials from the Organization of the American States and
United Nations are to mediate the meeting, U.N. spoeksman Francois
Giuliani said Friday.
   Roman Catholic Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo of Nicaragua also
has agreed to attend.

<HEAD>Report: Boeing Will Plead to Charges of Pentagon Trafficking</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boeing Co. plans to enter a plea to criminal
charges in connection with illegal trafficking in secret Pentagon
documents, according to federal court records in Alexandria, Va.
   The records show that Richard Lee Fowler, a former Boeing
company official indicted for crimes involving illegal dealing in
classified documents, named the company as a co-conspirator.
   The company is scheduled to enter a plea to an undisclosed
charge Nov. 13 in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Va. No charges
have been filed.
   By entering the pre-indictment plea, Boeing will avoid
indictment by the same federal grand jury that charged Fowler,
according to the Morning News Tribune of Tacoma, which broke the
story on Friday.
   Fowler, a senior marketing analyst for Boeing Aerospace in
Arlington, Va., until he was fired in 1986, was indicted in August
on 39 felony counts of conspiracy, mail fraud and other crimes
involving illegal dealing in classified documents.
   He has pleaded not guilty and is scheduled to go on trial Dec. 4.
   During the internal Boeing investigation that led to his firing,
Fowler told Boeing attorneys the reason he was hired by the
aerospace company was to obtain such documents.
   He is charged with obtaining documents such as the Pentagon's
five-year budget plan, the main defense-spending guide used by top
officials. The document could help a contractor plan bidding
schedules.
   Other papers he allegedly took include those related to the
Strategic Defense Initiative, for which Boeing has millions of
dollars' worth of contracts.
   Fowler was a civilian budget analyst for the Air Force before he
was hired by Boeing in 1978.
   Randy Bellows, the federal prosecutor on the Fowler case,
declined comment Thursday when asked by the Morning News Tribune
about Boeing's role as a co-conspirator.
   Boeing spokesmen Paul Binder in Seattle declined to comment on
the case when contacted by The Associated Press, saying Boeing's
policy is not to comment on the investigation.
   Court documents in Alexandria named the company as a
co-conspirator from 1979 through 1985.
   If Boeing pleads guilty to a criminal charge, the Seattle-based
aerospace giant would be the second major defense contractor
convicted in the federal probe of how defense contractors obtain
classified documents giving them an advance look into the
Pentagon's future needs.
   GTE avoided indictment by pleading guilty in 1985 to conspiring
to obtain classified defense documents illegally. Two GTE employees
and a consultant were indicted on similar charges.
   At the time, defense officials said the guilty plea was likely
to prevent any major actions by the Pentagon to suspend or bar GTE
from future contracts.
   It was the GTE case that apparently triggered the investigation
of Boeing and Fowler, the Morning News Tribune reported.
   Boeing and a number of other major defense contractors were
named during a 1986 court hearing in the case of the GTE
consultant, Bernie Zettl, who said trafficking in classified
Pentagon documents is widespread in the defense industry. Zettl's
case has not gone to trial.

   India has withdrawn its last contingent
of troops from the Maldives a year after they crushed a coup
attempt in the Indian Ocean archipelago, news reports said.
   State-run television said Maldives President Maumoon Abdul
Gayoom gave a ceremonial farewell Friday to 162 Indian soldiers who
had stayed back to train the country's National Security Service.
   India moved 1,600 paratroopers into the string of coral islands
500 miles off its southern coast Nov. 3, 1988, hours after an
attack by Sri Lankan mercenaries led by Maldivians opposed to
Gayoom.
   The mercenaries fled when the paratroopers landed. At least 68
Sri Lankans and seven Maldivians were later caught and sentenced to
prison terms.
   At least 17 Maldivians, mostly civilians, were killed in the
fighting.
   The Maldivian government has said the mercenaries were Tamil
militants who belonged to the People's Liberation Organization of
Tamil Eelam, one of the several guerrilla groups that had
participated in the Tamil separatist war against Sri Lanka's
Sinhalese majority.

<HEAD>Panel Hands Agent Orange Decision Back to Derwinski</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Veterans Secretary Edward J. Derwinski will
have to decide without the guidance he was looking for from an
advisory panel whether to award benefits to some Vietnam veterans
exposed to Agent Orange.
   Derwinski is expected to make the decision around Thanksgiving
as the result of court-ordered regulations for determining the
relationship between exposure to the herbicide exposure and cancer.
   Nearly 12,000 disability claims once denied by the VA are now
pending as a result of a court order issued in May by U.S. District
Judge Thelton E. Henderson in San Francisco.
   Derwinski was looking for the Environmental Hazards Advisory
Committee, made up largely of scientists, to clear up some of the
arguments over Agent Orange.
   But the panel, in its first ruling on Agent Orange, acknowledged
Friday that it couldn't come up with a definite conclusion. The
committee said it ``does not find the evidence sufficient at the
present time to conclude that there is a significant statistical
association between exposure to (Agent Orange) and non-Hodgkins
lymphoma.''
   They added they ``cannot rule out such an association.''
   Veterans' groups blame Agent Orange for cancers that have turned
up years later in former soldiers who were exposed when the United
States used it to clear jungle area in Vietnam during the war.
   Veterans say their non-Hodgkins lymphoma, soft tissue sarcoma
and other forms of cancer were caused by the defoliant.
   The government has long said that cancers cannot be definitively
linked to Agent Orange. No studies have been undertaken looking at
veterans who were exposed to the chemical because government
scientists contend they cannot create such a sample.
   In his ruling in May, Henderson said the VA had used criteria
more stringent than Congress intended in a 1984 law that ordered
benefits to veterans exposed to the herbicide.
   The VA has said the new regulations give Derwinski the freedom
to give veterans the benefit of the doubt absent any strong
recommendation by the committee, made up largely of scientists.
   The committee will meet in late January to address studies
covering Agent Orange exposure and soft tissue sarcomas as well as
porphyria cutanea tarda, an ailment that produces chronic skin
lesions. Those are the other two ailments addressed in Henderson's
court ruling.
   Several of Derwinski's actions have been interpreted as signs
that he wants to take action, if only limited, in favor of
veterans. Those include his decision not to appeal the May ruling,
his appointment of retired Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr. as a special
adviser and his statements that he will give veterans the benefit
of the doubt.
   Zumwalt ordered spraying of Agent Orange during the war, and a
son who served in Vietnam died of a cancer believed linked to
exposure.
   The American Legion, which has accused the panel of bias,
criticized Friday's statement.
   ``They spent entirely too much time on crossing the t's and
dotting the i's,'' said Richard S. Christian, a deputy director of
the American Legion.
   The main suspect in Agent Orange is the contaminant dioxin, a
byproduct of industrial processes known to be an extremely potent
carcinogen in laboratory animals. Its effects on humans are less
well documented.
   Of the roughly 230,000 veterans who have told VA they were
exposed to Agent Orange, 635 have documented cases of non-Hodgkins
lymphoma, the VA says.
   There are 35,000 veterans seeking benefits for problems linked
to Agent Orange exposure.

   About 500 automobile assembly workers

   The Portuguese news agency Lusa said the protesters on Friday
blocked the main rail line from the capital of Lisbon and the city

in the city of Guarda, where the Renault assembly plant is located.
   An official at Renault's Portuguese subsidiary, Renault

   A mild earthquake jolted western Nevada and
the Lake Tahoe area Friday but produced no reports of injury or
damage.
   ``It was just a rattler. It wasn't anything terribly bad,''
Debbie Bush said from the Walker General Store in Walker, Calif.
   The 11:09 a.m. quake, centered in a sparsely-populated area of
the central Sierra about 70 miles south of here, registered 4.3 on
the Richter scale, said Pat Jorgenson, spokeswoman for the U.S.
Geological Survey in Menlo Park, Calif.
   She said the initial temblor was followed three minutes later by
a 3.2 aftershock.
   The quake, in an area of frequent low-level seismic activity,
was felt from Reno south to the California Sierra.
   People in Carson City and at Lake Tahoe said they experienced a
rolling sensation for about two or three seconds, similar to the
effect they felt from the Oct. 17 earthquake in the San Francisco
Bay area.
   ``You could see things move and sway,'' Mrs. Bush said. ``We did
feel the San Francisco quake. I think a lot of us felt it was just
another aftershock. We didn't realize it was here.''
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage and 5 considerable
damage. The San Francisco quake, which registered 7.1, caused
widespread heavy damage.

<HEAD>Judge in Richard Miller Case Disqualifies Self</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal judge who has presided over two
trials in the espionage case of former FBI agent Richard W. Miller
disqualified himself Friday from a third trial ordered by an
appellate court.
   U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon said in a written ruling
that if he continued to preside over the case there was a good
chance ``the proceeding will become a trial not of the defendant's
innocence or guilt, but of the objectivity of this court.''
   Miller was charged in 1984 with selling secret documents to a
Soviet agent with whom he became sexually involved.
   The jury deadlocked in the first trial, and Kenyon declared a
mistrial. Miller was convicted in the second trial, and Kenyon
sentenced the ex-FBI agent to two life terms plus 50 years in
prison.
   But the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Miller's
conviction, and recently overturned Kenyon's order that Miller be
held without bail, pending a third trial set for April 3.
   ``We're very pleased,'' said Joel Levine, one of Miller's
defense attorneys. ``We think the judge did the correct thing, and
we think he did it in a very courageous and judicious manner.''
   Levine said the defense had been preparing a legal motion
requesting Kenyon to disqualify himself, although he declined to
discuss the grounds for his motion.
   The prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Attorney Russell Hayman, could
not be reached immediately for comment.

   Art Fletcher, President Bush's choice to
head the U.S. Civil Rights Commission, was admitted to a hospital
Friday complaining of chest pains.
   He was listed in satisfactory condition, suffering from angina,
said Steve Aagaard, spokesman for St. Elizabeth Medical Center.
   Angina is chest pains associated with the heart, but not a heart
attack, Aagaard said.
   ``I heard he was extremely fatigued,'' Aagaard said.
   Fletcher, 64, arrived in Yakima on Thursday from Washington,
D.C., for a conference on women and minorities in small business.
   Fletcher suffered a heart attack six years ago, said Juan
Huey-Ray, a conference organizer. He intends to return home as
scheduled Monday, Huey-Ray said.
   Fletcher was assistant secretary of labor to President Nixon,
deputy assistant for urban affairs for President Ford and as an
adviser to President Reagan.
   He is president of Arthur A. Fletcher &amp; Associates Inc., a
minority-owned consulting firm in Washington, D.C.
   Fletcher has said Bush, a long-time friend, intends to name him
to head the Civil Rights Commission. The appointment apparently is
awaiting completion of an FBI background check and also the outcome
of a debate between Congress and the White House on whether the
commission should survive beyond its expiration date at the end of
November.

people with a bomb aboard Pan Am Flight 103, according to remarks
of CIA Director William Webster in a published interview.
   But at this point the government is unable to issue arrest
warrants or seek indictments against anyone for the Dec. 21 bombing
of the Boeing 747 over Lockerbie, Scotland, according to the
interview report in Saturday editions of The Washington Post.
   The investigation has been hampered by ``too much discussion''
in the press about the work of intelligence services in several
countries, Webster said.
   ``It makes it very difficult to lay traps (that is, keep watch
on) and find new evidence when people start reading about
themselves,'' Webster was quoted as saying.
   ``And it make countries and (security) services defensive. ...
The assumption is: `If it turns out to have been on board in my
country, we will be accused of not having prevented it,''' Webster
said.
   There have been several reports that the plane was destroyed by
a bomb placed aboard at Frankfurt, with recent reports putting the
origin of the bomb in Malta, before the plane proceeded to London.
   The bombing, according to Webster, led the Justice Department to
focus on the legal issues involved in capturing suspects and
bringing them to the United States. A recent administration
directive, reversing previous policy, permits the FBI to make such
captures without informing the country where they take place.
   Other points in the interview:
   _The United States might be faced with rescuing some but not all
of its eight hostages in Lebanon, if it had information _ rare to
come by _ on where only some are being kept. They are not kept
together, Webster said.
   _The new understanding between the administration and the
congressional intelligence committees permitting CIA agents to help
coup attempts in which the death of the opposing leader is not a
goal does not extend to accidental killings.
   _It will take two years for the Soviet economy to make major
shifts away from military production and another two years for
consumers to see results, according to CIA estimates. Opposition to
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev is ``shrinking'' and Gorbachev
has ``running room,'' Webster said.
   _A power struggle is under way in the Central Military
Commission of China's Communist Party between Deng Xiaoping, the
85-year-old chairman whose chairmanship is only remaining official
post, and Yang Shangkun, 82, vice chairman and president of China.
   _Despite the provision of $300 million a month in military
supplies to the puppet Najibullah government in Kabul, Afghan
guerrillas are still winning the civil war there. Both the Soviets
and the CIA were surprised that Najibullah survived the rebel
assault after the Soviet troop pullout in February.

   The Coast Guard, Navy, Air Force and the Customs
Service continued their search today for the missing co-pilot of a
customs helicopter that crashed at sea while chasing a suspected
drug boat.
   Searchers were using a buoy equipped with a beacon to plot
currents in the area where the Blackhawk UH-60a helicopter plunged
into rough seas Thursday night, said customs spokesman Robert
Viator.
   Rescuers were able to pull five of the six people aboard the
craft out of the water. The missing crew member was identified as
co-pilot George Saenz.
   Some of those rescued said they heard the co-opilot yelling,
meaning he was able to get out of the helicopter before it sank,
said Roger Garland, chief of the customs aviation branch based at
Homestead Air Force Base.
   Jets, helicopters and a C-130 search plane, along with Coast
Guard patrol boats and a Navy hydrofoil, combed a 500-square-mile
area Friday while keeping a worried eye on an advancing storm front.
   A Navy hydrofoil stopped the suspect boat four miles away from
the crash scene, and three men aboard were detained. Viator said
the men later were released, though the boat was seized by U.S.
authorities. He did not say if the boat contained drugs.

<TEXT>
   Christian leader Michel Aoun dissolved
Parliament on Saturday, charging it had violated the Constitution
by approving an Arab peace plan for war-plagued Lebanon without his
consent.
   The 54-year-old general summoned reporters to his bunker command
post in suburban Baabda, east of Beirut, before dawn and read a
decree from his interim military government, dissolving the
legislature.
   His move appeared aimed at preventing Parliament from holding a
scheduled meeting later Saturday to ratify the peace accord and
elect a new House speaker and a president for Lebanon.
   The issue of Aoun's authority to dissolve Parliament is as
uncertain as any political question in a nation with two
governments, two armies and countless armed factions that has
suffered 14 years of sectarian civil war.
   ``We do not recognize him (Aoun) as a legitimate head of
government. So any decree he issues is illegitimate,'' leftist
Christian deputy Najah Wakim told reporters in Beirut after the
announcement. ``He will not be able to prevent us from electing a
president.''
   Aoun's decree called for a three-stage general elections for a
new Parliament in Beirut Jan. 7, in North Lebanon on Jan. 14, and
in East and South Lebanon on Jan. 21.
   But there is little likelihood that new elections would be held
in response to Aoun's decree, with Syrian troops controlling more
than 70 percent of Lebanon's territory.
   On Friday, bombs exploded at the homes of three Christian
legislators Friday, and police reported one woman wounded in in the
bombings.
   The rival army commands _ Christians led by Aoun and Moslems by
Brig. Gen. Sami Khatib _ placed their troops on alert, canceling
all leave, military sources reported.
   Arab League envoy Lakhdar Ibrahimi and Hussein Husseini, a
Shiite Moslem serving as parliament speaker, conferred with
politicians about the session scheduled for Saturday to ratify the
accord reached at Taif, Saudi Arabia.
   Villa Mansour, the parliament building in the no-man's land
between Beirut's Moslem and Christian sectors, ``is no longer a
suitable venue for tomorrow's session,'' Ibrahimi said.
   He did not elaborate, but Villa Mansour is within range of
Aoun's artillery in the Christian heartland east of the capital.
   The woman was wounded by the first bomb, at the home of deputy
Elias Khazen in Jounieh, north of Beirut, police said. They said
bombs outside the homes of deputies Auguste Bakhos and Salem Abdel
Nour in Christian east Beirut caused minor damage.
   All three men are in Paris, along with 25 other Christian
deputies. They refused to return home from Taif after Aoun called
them ``traitors'' for endorsing the agreement last month.
   No one claimed responsibility for the bombings, which occurred
after a 90-minute news conference by Aoun in his bunker below the
shattered presidential palace in Baabda, a Christian suburb.
   ``I ask the legislators not to commit the final and major
mistake,'' Aoun had said before announcing his decision to dissolve
Parliament. ``I ask them not to take part in the parliamentary
session. Let them take their time. Let them come here and let's
discuss the document.
   ``Parliament will be dissolved before the meeting gets under way
if they tried to pass the document without discussing what they
have done with me.''
   Sixty-three legislators of Parliament's 73 surviving members
approved the peace document after 23 days of discussion in Taif.
Parliament originally had 99 members, but no elections have been
held since 1972 because of the war.
   One of Aoun's main objections to the peace agreement is its lack
of a timetable for withdrawal of the 40,000 Syrian soldiers
stationed in Lebanon, with whom his forces fought a fierce
artillery war for six months until a cease-fire in September.
   He calls the Syrians, who are in Lebanon under a 1976
peacekeeping mandate from the Arab League, an occupation army and
declared a ``war of liberation'' to drive them out.
   When asked Friday whether he has the constitutional power to
dismiss the lawmakers, Aoun said: ``I am the guardian of the
constitution. I received my powers by a decree signed by a
president under oath. I plan to safeguard the constitution.''
   Only a president can dissolve Parliament under the Lebanese
constitution and political experts have said Aoun, as head of a
caretaker Cabinet, has no such power.
   Former President Amin Gemayel appointed him to head an interim
Cabinet minutes before Gemayel's term expired on Sept. 22, 1988,
with no successor chosen by Parliament.
   Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem who was prime minister under Gemayel,
leads a rival Moslem government.
   Aoun said Friday the peace accord ``gives away our homeland to
the Syrians.''
   ``The Taif document increases the authority of the prime
minister, who is based in a Syrian-controlled area,'' he said. ``I
do not object to the projected increase in the prime minister's
powers, but this should be done after a Syrian pullout.''
   The proposed reforms transfer some power from the president,
traditionally a Christian, to the prime minister and Parliament
speaker, both Moslems.
   Christians were the majority when Lebanon became independent of
France in 1943 and have controlled the government, army and
judiciary. Moslems account for about 55 percent of the population
and the Taif agreement is an attempt to satisfy their demands for
more authority.

   Ed Koch, the big-city mayor with the mouth to
match, will put it where the money is when he leaves office Jan. 1
and enters the high-ticket lecture circuit. He may do commercials
too.
   He will be represented as a lecturer by the Harry Walker Agency,
whose clients include Henry Kissinger, former President Ford,
ex-U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick and former House Speaker
Thomas P. ``Tip'' O'Neill. Its top clients command $20,000 to
$25,000 per spiel, plus expenses.
   A lawyer for Koch, Allen G. Schwartz, said he also was
negotiating a contract for Koch to do commercials for the William
Morris Agency.
   Koch, his bid for a fourth four-year term thwarted by his
Democratic primary defeat in September, declined on Friday to say
what products he might endorse. But he said he didn't think making
commercials was undignified.
   ``I have served for 12 years at a vastly reduced income that I
might have otherwise made,'' Koch said. ``I've served my time.''
   Koch said he could lecture on subjects such as government,
drugs, AIDS, the economy, and international affairs.
   Don Walker, president of the Harry Walker Agency, said his
office has received hundreds of inquiries in the past 12 years from
business groups, trade associations and universities eager to hear
Koch speak.
   Koch already has agreed to become a visiting fellow at New York
University where he will lecture on urban affairs and government,
and a daily commentator on WNEW-AM Radio.

   Adam Rich, the youngest star of the old

left him comatose for more than a month, his mother said.
   ``Adam was very ill for five weeks, but he's on the road to
recovery,'' Francine Rich said Friday.
   Rich's publicist, Jeff Ballard, said the former child star
apparently became ill with a flu virus that settled in his brain
and nearly paralyzed him for five weeks. He is recovering at a
clinic in the San Fernando Valley suburbs.
   Ballard thinks Rich, 21, may have caught the flu while working
three straight weeks, for 15 hours a day, on the set of the movie,
``Eight is Enough Wedding.''
   The movie, which featured the original cast from the television
series of ``Eight is Enough,'' aired on NBC Oct. 15. Rich returned
as a grown-up version of his Nicholas Bradford character, the baby

   Comedian Andrew Dice Clay pleaded
innocent to trespassing charges stemming from a restaurant ruckus.
   The 33-year-old Clay, whose real name is Andrew Clay
Silverstein, was charged with refusing to leave the Ben Frank
restaurant in West Hollywood on Oct. 13.
   An attorney for the comedian, who lives in New York and wasn't
present for his Municipal Court arraignment Friday, entered an
innocent plea to the misdemeanor charge.
   Silverstein was arresed after the owner of Ben Frank recognized
him from an earlier disagreement at the restaurant, authorities
said. The comedian allegedly refused the restaurant manager's
demands to leave.
   Clay caused a stir Sept. 6 when he used profanity during the
live televised broadcast of cable television's MTV Video Music
Awards. MTV officials afterward announced the comic would be banned
from the cable channel for life.

   Pete Rose's biography contains no major
revelations about the scandal that caused his suspension from
baseball, but Rose admits in the book that he deserved the sanction
because of his illegal gambling.
   ``I have no regrets,'' Rose says in the book, ``Pete Rose: My
Story.'' ``I did some bad and stupid things. I deserve to be
punished. Making this settlement was the right thing for me to do.''
   The book, written by Roger Kahn, was scheduled for release
Wednesday by Macmillan Publishing Co., but was shipped to some
stores early by suppliers who ``jumped the gun,'' and was available
in some bookstores Friday, said Macmillan spokeswoman Susan Richman.
   The book repeats Rose's denials that he bet on baseball or that
he knew his close associates were involved in drug dealing.
   Rose says he knew he could be suspended from baseball for
placing bets on other sports with bookmakers, and loaned former
associate Paul Janszen $10,000 last winter with hopes of silencing
Janszen.
   After a falling out over a gambling debt last winter, Janszen
told baseball authorities that he placed bets on baseball for Rose.

   A House subcommittee chairman wants Federal
Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan to consider making stock
traders use more of their own money when they deal in stock index
futures.
   In a letter to Greenspan released Friday, Rep. Edward Markey,
chairman of the House subcommittee that oversees the financial
markets, asked Greenspan to ``review immediately the need to vest
margin-setting authority for stock index futures in the Federal
Reserve.''
   Stock index futures are securities that combine aspects of
futures contracts and stock trading, with investors buying a
contract tied to the performance of a group of stocks such as the
Standard and Poor's Index of 500 stocks.
   Margins are the amount of money or collateral an investor must
put down to buy a security or futures contract. In the stock
market, the margin is 50 percent of the stock's price. Futures
margins are usually much less, with the stock index futures margin
usually at about 7 percent.
   Markey, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee
on finance, also asked Greenspan to raise stock index futures
margin levels ``comparable to stock margin levels.''
   Currently the securities exchanges set margin levels themselves.
   Noting Greenspan's previous opposition to such a move, Markey
wrote: ``Our financial markets are in crisis and swift action by
the Federal Reserve to steady our markets and preserve our capital
formation process is needed.''
   There was no answer at the Fed when a reporter telephoned for
comment Friday evening.
   Markey said the Oct. 13 market drop, when the Dow Jones
industrial average fell more than 190 points, and lesser swings in
the markets since then ``have reignited substantial and sustained
fears regarding the fundamental stability and utility of our
capital markets.''
   Markey also asked Greenspan to investigate whether risk
arbitrageurs, speculators on the price gaps between stocks and
their index futures, are not always subject to the same margin
levels as other individual investors. The congressman also asked
the Fed to look into whether such market participants contributed
to the recent volatility of the markets.
   Markey asked Greenspan to comment on the issues at a hearing
before Markey's subcommittee will conduct next Thursday on
computer-driven program trading.

   A woman held her 15-month-old son at knife-point
in her locked car for more than eight hours Friday as police tried
to talk her out of injuring the child.
   The unidentified woman apparently had a disagreement with her
mother as they were driving to the Texas Medical Center about 3
p.m. CST. She pulled the knife and the mother fled the car at an
intersection near the Astrodome, police said.
   Members of the police SWAT force tried to coax her to roll down
the car window by offering a baby bottle about 11:20 p.m. CST, but
she responded only by honking the car horn.
   Police said the woman may have been hallucinating but they

<TEXT>
   President Bush is hoping his late
appearances in Virginia and New Jersey boost the Republican Party's
uphill candidacies for governor and urge more GOP voters to the
polls next Tuesday.
   Bush was on the stump trying to pump up Republican activists,
but he stayed clear of the volatile abortion issue that has been
prominent in both governor's races.
   Pro-choice activists, waving signs and chanting, ``Pro-choice,
pro-choice,'' showed up at Bush's outdoor rallies in both Richmond,
Va., and Bloomfield, N.J., on Friday.
   Bush's New Jersey stop was for a rally aimed at boosting turnout
for the critical state legislative races and helping Rep. James
Courter in his faltering governor's race against Democratic Rep.
James Florio.
   Noting the slim 41-39 Republican majority in New Jersey's
legislature, Bush said, ``We cannot go back'' to a
Democratic-controlled government. ``We must not go back. We have
got to keep New Jersey proud. We have got to keep New Jersey
Republican.''
   He said New Jersey, under eight years of leadership by
Republican Gov. Thomas Kean, has ``a new feeling of pride'' because
of its improving economy, environment and education.
   Bush and Courter did not mention abortion. Nor did GOP
gubernatorial candidate J. Marshall Coleman in Virginia, where Bush
campaigned earlier Friday.
   Democrats in both states have hammered at the issue in this
year's campaigns, attacking the Republicans for opposing women's
choice on abortion.
   In Virginia, abortion has been the most emotional issue of the
campaign. Democrat Douglas Wilder ran a TV ad attacking Coleman,
who opposes abortion except when the mother's life is endangered.
   A poll by The Washington Post released today showed Wilder with
a 52-41 percent over Coleman in the week before the election.
Coleman's aides dispute the poll's results, which showed the
Democrat with a larger lead than other recent surveys.
   Anti-abortion activists have heckled Wilder at recent rallies
and have passed out fliers _ which were also distributed at the
Coleman rally Friday _ calling him a ``baby killer.''
   Bush's visit came a day after an anti-abortion group accused
four TV stations of refusing to air its pro-Coleman ads.
   In New Jersey, Florio is pro-choice while Courter says he is
against abortion personally and supports abortion only in cases of
rape, incest and to protect the life of the mother. He also has
said, however, he would not try to dismantle the state's tough
pro-choice law.
   Abortion has long been a prickly issue in Bush's political
career. Political heat over the issue was raised by this year's
Supreme Court ruling giving states greater powers to regulate
abortion.
   Asked why Bush did not raise the issue of during his campaign
stops, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater replied, ``We
don't do why-didn't-ya's.''
   He said Bush's position ``is well known.''
   Bush once backed the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision upholding
abortion. He now supports abortion only in cases of rape, incest
and where the mother's life is threatened, but he does not favor
federal funding of abortions for poor women.
   In New Jersey, Florio supporters carried signs with slogans such
as ``Florio Equals Choice,'' and ``Bush, Keep Paws Off Women's
Bodies,''
   Bush discounted late October polls that showed Courter trailing
Florio by 15 to 19 percentage points.
   ``You're looking at a guy who doesn't believe in these polls,''
he said, recalling surveys in his 1988 presidential race that
showed him well behind the summer before the election.
   White House political director Jim Wray said the White House
wanted to ``do what we can in the final kick to help Jim Courter.''
But he added that equally important is ``what we can do to help the
whole ticket.''
   ``A lot can happen in four days in politics,'' he said,
shrugging off the polls.
   GOP spokesmen said the trip was important to get out Republican
voters for state legislative candidates, because the legislatures
will control 1991 redistricting of political district boundaries.
Controlling the reapportionment process is of great importance to
both Republicans and Democrats.

   Cuddling her 2-year-old daughter at
a shelter for East German refugees, Kerstin Hanne said she cannot
imagine returning to her homeland, despite promises of reform by
the Communist leadership.
   ``If we were in East Germany now, we'd certainly leave,'' said
Mrs. Hanne, who arrived here with her husband and child in late
September.
   The exodus of tens of thousands of East Germans to the West has
set the stage for dramatic new developments back home, including
pledges of greater freedom to travel and more open discussion of
social problems in the press and on the streets.
   But instead of ebbing, the flood of East Germans is reaching
ever greater levels, reflecting deeply ingrained doubt about the
chances for lasting change.
   ``We have hope,'' Mrs. Hanne, 25, said of the prospects for her
homeland. ``But I can't imagine far-reaching changes in the system,
and I can't imagine the Communist Party not being in control.''
   Thousands of East Germans who jammed into the West German
embassy in Prague have just been given permission to emigrate. Many
also are fleeing through Hungary, with Bavarian border officials
reporting hundreds of new arrivals from that route each day.
   The refugees say they are lured here by the possibility of good
jobs, stores filled with modern consumer goods, the freedom to
speak one's mind, and a more promising future for their children.
   Silke Kleinhans of Leipzig, another refugee among the 80 or so
at the Remagen shelter, said she felt ``somewhat mistrustful'' of
the new promises in East Germany. ``We want to see more deeds,''
said the 24-year-old mother of two.
   Another refugee said that for many of those leaving East
Germany, the first consideration is their children.
   ``You have to think about what it would mean for the children to
remain in East Germany. Their future is more secure here,'' said
the woman, who would only give her last name, Schwolow.
   Refugees interviewed at the shelter in Remagen, about 12 miles
south of Bonn, said they like their new lives in West Germany
despite its trials _ like missing their relatives, and trying to
find permanent housing.
   The Kleinhans and Hanne families have been looking for
apartments since their arrival at the end of September.
   The Schwolows, who arrived Oct. 10, also still are looking for
an apartment.
   ``But it's not very difficult finding a job here,'' said Mrs.
Schwolow's husband, who also declined to give his full name. ``I
had 15 different offers for work before I took my job as a
mechanic.''
   Schwolow said his gross monthly salary is about $1,639, more
than twice what he would be making in East Germany.
   East German refugees are given automatic citizenship in West
Germany and receive help from the government in starting their new
lives.
   Mrs. Schwolow said that until East Germany puts its economy in
order and makes better consumer goods available at affordable
prices, the exodus to the West will likely continue.
   ``Huge economic reforms are needed. People know what's available
in the West, and that creates problems,'' she said.
   The East German government has promised amnesty to refugees who
return, but none of the refugees interviewed at the shelter said
they would go back.
   The refugees said they do not feel any special pride for their
part in an exodus that helped prod East German leaders into calling
for social reform.
   ``What we do feel is sadness that such a decision _ to leave
East Germany _ had to be taken. We gave up everything we had, we
left behind friends, relatives, and siblings. It is sad that
leaving was our only choice,'' said Schwolow.

   Evan Tsao was just one of 112 casualties
of United Flight 232, but his death at age 23 months might lead to
dramatic changes in the way young children are seated on airplanes.
   The Federal Aviation Administration is considering new rules
that would end parents' money-saving but dangerous practice of
carrying infants on their laps during plane flights.
   The agency isn't committed to requiring separate seats for young
children, but that is among a range of options being studied for a
new child safety policy the FAA will recommend to the
Transportation Department by the end of the year, an official
testified Friday.
   Donnell Pollard, the FAA's cabin safety specialist, was among
the witnesses at a National Transportation Safety Board hearing on
the crash of the United DC-10 that crashed July 19 at Sioux City's
airport. There were 184 survivors.
   Current FAA guidelines allow children less than 24 months old to
ride aboard an adult's lap, although the agency recommends that
infants ride in a separate seat, strapped in a child safety seat.
   ``We're considering a lot of factors,'' Ms. Pollard testified.
``We have indications from the public that they like the option of
not having to purchase a seat for children under the age of 2.''
   Friday was the fourth and final day of the NTSB hearing on the
crash. The board is expected to issue a ruling on the probable
cause next summer.
   Experts believe a faulty rear engine fan disk split in two
during flight, severing hydraulic lines that are essential for
controlling the plane.
   Evan was one of five unrestrained children aboard Flight 232,
according to United spokesman Robert Doughty.
   NTSB records show his mother, Sylvia Tsao, 30, was uninjured but
that Evan was killed when she lost her grip on him as the plane
split apart and burst into flames.
   ``Suddenly the world seemed to end, and I saw for an instant my
son's body floating and flying at a very high rate of speed down
the right aisle towards the back of the plane _ his head first, his
face away from me,'' Ms. Tsao told federal investigators who
interviewed her after the crash.
   ``Infants, toddlers, young children's safety should no longer be
ignored as if they do not count,'' she added. ``If these kids need
aircraft seats, then parents must be warned that they should put
kids in them.''
   Questioning Ms. Pollard on Friday, Fidel Gonzales of the
Association of Flight Attendants union pressed for a commitment
that the FAA toughen its standards for infant seating.
   ``Isn't this a form of discrimination against those least able
to protect themselves?'' he asked.
   ``We don't consider that discrimination,'' Ms. Pollard
responded. ``There is the option of purchasing a seat and coming on
board with an infant child restraint system.''
   Most airlines allow parents who decline to purchase tickets for
infants to put the children in vacant seats, if available. However,
few of the airlines provide child restraint seats, similar to those
most states require in cars. The FAA issued an advisory in 1985
that recommends use of child restraint seats in airplanes.
   Doughty told reporters that United offers discount seats for
infants on flights that aren't full, and allows parents to bring
child restraint seats aboard for use in vacant seats.
   Walt Coleman, vice president of operations for the Air Transport
Association, an industry group representing major airlines,
testified Friday that airlines have found many parents want to hold
their infants in flight.
   ``I think what we've done is transfer that responsibility to the
passenger,'' he said.

<HEAD>Congressman Wants Says FDA Lax in Watching Medical Devices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

   A congressman says the Food and Drug
Administration may be allowing unsafe medical devices to remain on
the market by failing to keep tabs on the industry.
   Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., said two General Accounting Office
reports show makers of products ranging from pacemakers to
suntanning lamps routinely fail to notify the FDA when they learn
of problems with their products.
   The reports show ``manufacturers who profit from the sale of
these products often act without FDA oversight in deciding whether
to keep their devices on the market when problems begin to
surface,'' Waxman, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce health
subcommittee, said Friday. He requested the GAO studies.
   The GAO said in one report that nearly half the recalls from
fiscal 1985 to fiscal 1988 in which the product posed a high risk
were initiated by the companies without notifying the government.
   Overall, 78 percent of the 1,245 medical device recalls during
that period were made without alerting regulators, the report said.
   Waxman, whose panel is to hold hearings on the subject next
week, said the FDA was ``bending over backward to accommodate the
interests of the industry rather than doing its job of protecting
the public.''
   FDA spokesman Bill Grigg said officials had not seen the report
but he said the agency ``believes the product recall system works
well within the resources and legal authority given us by
Congress.''
   Grigg said the agency acts ``promptly and aggressively'' when it
has information about a problem product.
   He said when a company has a problem with a product on the
market, ``we would not want them to delay recalling. We want
industry to initiate recalls as soon as a problem is discovered.''
   Companies have been required since December 1984 to report to
the FDA when they learn their product may have caused or
contributed to a serious injury or death or has malfunctioned.
   During the four-year period studied, which began about three
months before the regulation went into effect, 31 products in the
high-risk category were recalled and no report was made in 48
percent of the cases, the GAO said.
   In addition, 792 recalls were made for medical devices whose
problems posed a lower risk, and in 72 percent of the cases, the
company did not alert the FDA, according to the report.
   For the lowest risk products, 422 recalls were made and no
report was made in 92 percent of the cases.
   Cardiovascular and anesthesiology devices accounted for more
than a quarter of all the recalls.

<HEAD>US Discussed Pan Am Bombing With Syria</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department says it is ``not
satisfied'' with Syria's response to discussions of possible
terrorist connection to the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103.
   Spokesman Richard Boucher disclosed the talks Friday, saying the
United States urged Syria to ``take action'' against the Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine, General Command and other
``terrorist groups.''
   Boucher said the talks with Syria about links to terrorist
groups began before the Pan Am bombing on Dec. 21, 1988 that killed
270 people.
   The PFL-GC has been named in news reports as a prime suspect in
the bombing, but Boucher did not confirm whether any specific group
was suspected of the bombing.
   Several terrorist groups operate with Syria's support in the
country as well as in areas of neighboring Lebanon under Syrian
control, Boucher said.
   ``The United States is not satisfied with the Syrian response to
date,'' the spokesman said. ``We will continue to press our
concerns.''
   A seven-member presidential commission decided on Thursday to
look into Pan Am's allegation that 36 hours before the explosion
over Lockerbie, Scotland, the Israeli intelligence agency warned
U.S. authorities of a possible terrorist attack.
   The commission also agreed to investigate Pan Am's contention
that West German authorities had reported ``suspicious activities''
at the Frankfurt airport within 90 minutes of the flight.
   Besides Syria, Boucher said discussions were held with ``other
countries which may have information about terrorist groups.'' He
did not name the countries.
   He said the United States ``has repeatedly expressed concern,
both publicly and privately, about terrorist groups supported by
Syria, including the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command. On numerous occasions we have asked
Syria to take action against these groups, both inside Syria and in
Syria-controlled areas of Lebanon.''
   Meanwhile, the spokesman for a Lebanese-American organization
said nearly 15,000 acres of the Bekaa Valley, which is under Syrian
control, are being used to produce heroin.
   ``They are doing this with the full knowledge of the U.S.
government,'' said Joseph L. Boohaker, spokesman for the National
Alliance of Lebanese Americans.
   He said Syria and Colombia were cooperating in drug trafficking.
He showed television film of what he said was a meeting between a
Syrian representative and Pablo Escobar, an alleged Colombian drug
smuggler wanted by the United States, outside a hotel in Larnaca,
Cyprus.
   The State Department said Friday night: ``We have no knowledge
of links between Syria and the Colombian `Medellin Cartel.'''
   Also Friday, Rep. James Traficant, D-Ohio, said an insurance
investigator's report convinced him the CIA had been tipped in
advance that terrorists might attempt to blow up Pan Am's plane,
but remained silent. He asserted the report, which he did not
release, concludes the CIA was ``covering up a drug run,''
protecting the terrorists' Frankfurt-to-New York heroin route in
exchange for contacts that might lead to the release of American
hostages.
   The CIA immediately denied Traficant's charges and labeled the
report ``nonsense.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With two shining stalwarts, Leo Nucci as
Rigoletto and Luciano Pavarotti as the Duke, June Anderson made her
Metropolitan Opera debut as Gilda in a new production of
``Rigoletto.''
   The evening was a triumph for all of them.
   Miss Anderson, a Boston native who grew up in Connecticut, is
new to the Met but not to her co-stars. The three of them have made
a soon-to-be-released recording of ``Rigoletto.''
   Her voice is clear and secure, lovely and fresh. The coloratura
grows out of her full voice. She puts personality into both the
lyrical singing and the coloratura; it isn't just a profusion of
rapid, high, glinting notes.
   Pavarotti was in top vocal form Friday night. He moved easily
enough that one didn't think of his sciatica until he chose a
careful pose before singing ``La donna e mobile.'' He held final
notes excitingly but never too long.
   Nucci was splendid, his voice sounding like a heroic
personality, even when his acting showed Rigoletto to be bitter,
defeated or poisonously vindictive. The music is meant to be sung
this well and Nucci makes Rigoletto a character to understand and
sympathize with.
   Marcello Panni of Rome, in his debut season at the Met,
conducted with fast tempos in Act 1. He maintained the opera's
musical tension excellently.
   The new production is better than the one it replaced, though it
would have been better still if it had been more brightly lighted.
Some of the four sets looked like paintings by old masters and some
just looked gloomy.
   Usually there was a spotlight on principals. In the scene where
Rigoletto is with other men and blindfolded, there wasn't a
spotlight and one couldn't always find him.
   The Duke's palace is stone, with stone staircases. Rickety, worn
stairways lead to Rigoletto's house and to the final act's
riverside inn.
   The production, by Otto Schenk, tries to tell the story
logically. Now, one person climbs a ladder, goes down inside stairs
and opens the gate to the rest instead of everybody climbing the
ladder and one carrying Gilda down the ladder.
   And it showcases the stars better than the previous production.
Now, when the Duke is worrying about Gilda's kidnapping, he is
alone on stage instead of in the middle of his milling court.
   All the voices blended and ensembles were as enjoyable as the
famous arias.

<HEAD>Congressman: CIA Tipped of Possible Threat to Flight 103</HEAD>

   A congressman says he'll release an insurance
investigator's report which he claims documents connections between
the CIA and terrorists responsible for the bombing of Pan Am Flight
103.
   The report shows the CIA was tipped in advance there might be a
bomb aboard the flight, Rep. James Traficant, D-Ohio, told a news
conference Friday.
   He said the report concludes the CIA was ``covering up a drug
run'' in exchange for contacts that might lead to the release of
American hostages in the Middle East, and the terrorists put the
bomb where a package of heroin was supposed to be.
   The CIA immediately denied Traficant's charges. ``We have not
seen the report Rep. Traficant has described,'' said CIA spokesman
Mark Mansfield. ``The allegations it makes, however, are nonsense.''
   The congressman said he had not checked the report with the CIA
before his meeting with reporters.
   Traficant, who once ran a short-lived campaign for president,
read from what he said was a report prepared by an investigator
hired by Pan Am's insurance underwriter.
   The report claims the CIA had pinpointed the location of the
eight Americans held captive in Lebanon and several of its agents
were on Flight 103 along with evidence that may have survived the
explosion, Traficant said.
   The plane exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, last December, and
270 people died.
   Traficant said the report detailed a complicated web of plots
and connections involving hostages, spies, bomb experts and
drug-runners. He refused to make copies of it available on the spot
but called a Monday news conference to distribute the document.
   Among the claims in the report is that West German intelligence
agents told CIA agents in Frankfurt about an hour before Flight 103
departed that they suspected a bomb may have been enclosed in a
specific suitcase, Traficant said.
   The report says CIA agents told their superiors in Washington
about the suspicion but got no response and the suitcase was
allowed on the plane undisturbed, Traficant told a news conference.
   ``Whether or not they contacted CIA here I don't know. The
report says they did,'' Traficant said. ``The bottom line is ... I
think the CIA knew.
   ``Was it a CIA rogue group? I don't know,'' he said. ``My charge
is the CIA was covering up a drug run from Frankfurt to New York,
trying to penetrate information on the hostages, and that drug run
uncovered by terrorist spies and intermediaries ended up using that
drug run.''
   ``Scotland Yard had found specific bomb-proof types of luggage
whose contents were intact,'' Traficant said. The items in that
luggage were turned over to the U.S. government, he said.
   Traficant said the report concluded the bombing was ordered by
Ahmed Jibril, leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine, General Command, working through arms and drug smuggler
Monzer Al-Kassar.
   Pan Am has subpoenaed documents relating to Al-Kassar, who in
1987 was linked to the secret operation that became known as the
Iran-Contra affair.
   Traficant said the report said Al-Kassar had a relationship with
a CIA unit, providing the CIA with terrorist contacts in exchange
for undisturbed transit of heroin into the United States.
   ``I think Jibril wanted to make a terrorist statement in
response to the (American-downed Iranian) commercial airliner,''
Traficant said. ``He uncovered the insulated drug route, Frankfurt
to New York. He then decided to supplant and use a bomb instead of
that drug route, unbeknownst to even Kassar.''
   ``The CIA used a very weird means to a tragic ends,'' Traficant
said, reading from a report that he said included names, addresses
and bank account numbers in several countries.

<HEAD>Ethics Committee Questions Five Senators About S&amp;L Influence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Ethics Committee wants five
senators to explain whether big campaign contributions led them to
use their influence for a failing savings and loan.
   The requests were made by letter on Oct. 16, three days after
Common Cause, which describes itself as a citizens' lobby, asked
the committee to open an investigation of the contributions.
   The contributions were made by Charles H. Keating, whose Lincoln
Savings and Loan Association of Irvine, Calif., owned through
Arizona-based American Continental Corp., was taken over by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in April of this year.
   ``We got a letter two weeks ago from the Ethics Committee
advising us of the Common Cause complaint and asking that we would
please write them a response,'' Murray Flander, press secretary to
Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., said Friday.
   The letter ``was a statement of the fact that Common Cause had
made this request of the committee and asked the senators for a
response,'' said Robert Maynes, a spokesman for Sen. Dennis
DeConcini, D-Ariz.
   The five senators _ DeConcini; Cranston; John McCain, R-Ariz.;
Don Riegle, D-Mich.; and John Glenn, D-Ohio _ intervened with
regulators when examiners were considering what to do about Lincoln.
   The senators have said they asked only that the long examination
be brought to a conclusion and made no effort to influence actions
of the regulators.
   The regulators have filed a $1.1 billion civil lawsuit against
Keating, members of his family and associates charging fraud and
racketeering.
   Some of the five senators had responded by Friday and some had
not.
   Flander said Cranston had not yet replied. An aide to Riegle who
asked not to be identified said the senator had responded but the
aide said he could not say what the response was.
   Spokesmen for McCain and Glenn were not home Friday evening.
   Maynes said he gave the committee DeConcini's response before
the letter was received.
   Maynes and the Riegle aide said the Ethics Committee had given
no indication of what it planned to do next.
   Maynes said he had made available DeConcini's response to
reporters.
   Describing that response in summary fashion, Maynes quoted
DeConcini as saying on one occasion, ``If I had known then what I
know now, I wouldn't have taken the money and I wouldn't have gone
to the meetings.''
   Members of Congress are obliged to try to help constituents with
regulatory agencies, and American Continental had a $50 million
payroll in the state, Maynes said.
   DeConcini and Riegle have returned their campaign contributions
from Keating. Cranston never got campaign contributions, but
hundreds of thousands of dollars were given to voter registration
drives with which he was affiliated.

<HEAD>Leaders Hope to Break Stalemate on Major Legislation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional staff members are working over
the weekend to negotiate an end to the stalemate that has blocked
passage of deficit-reduction and debt-ceiling bills.
   ``We ... anticipate being able to reach agreement and (that we)
can announce it on Monday,'' Majority Leader George J. Mitchell,
D-Maine, said Friday.
   Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said he could not say an
agreement is near ``until we find what the staff is coming up with
Monday.''
   But Mitchell said ``there are no hangups'' among House and
Senate leaders on what the agreement should contain.
   President Bush cleared away a major obstacle to passage of the
legislation Thursday when he and his Senate allies said they will
drop efforts to add a capital gains tax cut to the debt bill.
   Bush's concession apparently ended any real chance that the
reduction, which he promised during his 1988 election campaign,
would be passed this year.
   At the same time, Bush demanded Congress beef up the
deficit-reduction bills it is considering. Unless the final bill
produces at least a $14 billion reduction, he said, he will let
stand $16 billion of automatic, across-the-board spending cuts that
were triggered on Oct. 16.
   Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the House Budget
Committee, estimated the budget outline agreed to by Congress and
the administration last spring requires no more than $10 billion in
deficit reduction. ``This is not time to add ... additional issues
to that agreement,'' he said.
   The next important deadline facing Congress falls Thursday. The
government will default on its debts on that day unless lawmakers
agree on raising federal borrowing authority above the present $2.8
trillion limit.
   Congressional leaders are deciding whether to add to the
debt-limit bill popular amendments scaling back catastrophic
medical insurance for retirees and repealing a law requiring that
employer-financed health insurance not discriminate against
lower-paid workers.

<HEAD>GOP Criticized For Blaming Catastrophic Plan on Democrats</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nobody appears to want to take credit for the
Medicare catastrophic health-care program that was enacted with
fanfare last year _ not now that it's been rebuffed by angry senior
citizens.
   Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., on Friday blasted the Republican
National Committee for sending out a fund-raising letter that
includes this description for the genesis of the catastrophic
package:
   ``Before President Bush was elected, the Democrats in Congress
passed legislation ... and placed a tax on senior citizens to pay
for Catastrophic Health Insurance.''
   Pryor, chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, said
the letter from GOP Chairman Lee Atwater was ``at best misleading
and at worst downright deceitful.''
   Republican National Committee spokesman B.J. Cooper said the
letter was written by a independent vendor who neglected GOP
instructions to delete the section on the catastrophic law. Cooper
said it was deleted after the first mailing.
   When the catastrophic package was signed into law,
then-President Reagan hailed its innovative financing mechanisms _
which include the surtax that has generated all the senior
opposition.
   The House last month voted to scrap the program, and the Senate
to preserve only limited benefits and cancel the surtax. The two
chambers have yet to take final action to roll back all or part of
the program.

   The Consumer Product Safety Commission says
Johnson and Johnson Baby Products Co. is voluntarily recalling more
than 1 million ``Spin-A-Sound'' infant toys because they present a
choking and cutting hazard.
   The rattle-like toy has two large yellow wheels on each end with
red plastic caps. A metal axle on which three red, blue and green
plastic paddles rotate, joins the two wheels.
   The red end caps can come loose from the toy, which is part of
the New Jersey-based company's child development series, the agency
said Friday.
   The caps are small enough to be swallowed and could choke small
children. When they are removed, they expose the sharp points of
the metal axle, the commission said.
   The company said 1.3 million of the toys have been sold
nationwide since 1981. People may return the toys to the company
for a $10 refund.
   The toys may be sent to: Spin-A-Sound Recall, P.O. Box 11460,
Des Moines, Iowa, 50381-1460 or the company will send consumers a

<NOTE>Court Clears Way for Prosecution in Capitol Bombing Case</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court has given the
government the go-ahead to prosecute three people implicated in the
bombing of the U.S. Capitol and other government buildings.
   The court, acting Friday, reversed an April 11 decision by U.S.
District Court Judge Harold Greene, who said the same evidence is
being used in successive trials on different charges against Susan
Rosenberg, Timothy Blunk and Alan Berkman. Such a procedure
violates the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment, said
Greene, but the appeals court disagreed.
   ``We find no support for the use of a `same actual evidence'
test in assessing whether successive prosecutions violate the
double jeopardy clause,'' said appeals court judge Abner Mikva.
   Rosenberg, Blunk and Berkman were convicted in separate trials
in Pennsylvania and New Jersey of conspiracy to possess
unregistered firearms, explosives and false identification.
   They were then indicted in Washington, D.C., for the actual
bombings and were listed as unindicted co-conspirators in an
alleged scheme involving four other people to carry out the
bombings.
   Seven people are accused of bombing the U.S. Capitol, the
National War College Building at Fort McNair, the Computer Center
at the Washington Navy Yard and the Officer's Club at the Navy Yard
in 1983 and 1984.

   Marjorie Mason always wanted to go to
Hawaii, but fear of burdening her family led the 79-year-old widow
to pinch her pennies.
   Dreading the financial drain of a future illness, she kept a
tight budget. Paying to have the lawn mowed in front of the house
she's owned for 34 years was about as close as she came to a frill.
   But thanks to an experimental federal program that allows her to
get a monthly check from the equity in her house, the trip to
Hawaii is in the offing.
   Mrs. Mason on Wednesday became the first beneficiary of the
``reverse mortgage'' program sponsored by the Department of Housing
and Urban Development.
   ``I'm not going go hog wild,'' Mrs. Mason said Friday. ``I'll
still budget my money. I always have.
   ``But I've never been able to go on trips, and I've always
wanted to go to Hawaii. I've got one friend who keeps pestering me
to go there, and I've been using all kinds of excuses. Now I think
I'm going to say yes.''
   Her loan is funded by a $100 million pilot program, offered
through the Federal National Mortgage Association, that is offering
mortgages to homeowners 62 and older.
   In a reverse mortgage, elderly people who own their property
outright or have only a minimal mortgage debt can take out a new
mortgage. Instead of receiving a lump sum, they either draw on a
line of credit or get monthly payments. When they die or move, the
loan is repaid by selling the home.
   The program is designed for older people who have equity in
their home but need additional money for monthly living expenses,
property taxes or serious illnesses.
   For Mrs. Mason, the program is ideal.
   ``Your biggest asset is your home, and it's just sitting
there,'' she said. ``You can't do anything with it as long as
you're alive, and when you're dead it's too late.''
   The three-bedroom house that she and her husband bought new in
1955 has been paid off for 20 years.
   She has been a widow since 1970 and has never worked. Her only
son died last year, her daughter-in-law remarried and her two
grandsons are both grown.
   She gets her income from Social Security, a small pension from
the company where her husband was an engineer and a few stocks and
certificates of deposit, she said.
   ``The problem is my income doesn't go up with inflation,'' she
said.
   Mrs. Mason refused to discuss her income, the value of her house
or the amount she is getting from the reverse mortgage.
   More than anything, she feared making her family pay if she
contracted a long illness.
   ``If you have cancer or something, it can really deplete
savings, and then you become such a burden on other people,'' she
said. ``I just didn't want that.''
   She also wanted to stay in her home in this quiet Kansas City,
Mo., suburb, where she enjoys working in the yard, cleaning her
house and occasional forays to a restaurant or the movies with
friends.
   ``I can use this to spend on nursing care in my own home if I
ever get sick,'' she said.
   Mrs. Mason was one of about 300 people who made inquiries about
the program to the Kansas City HUD office, said Coral Eberly,
spokesman for James B. Nutter &amp; Co., the local lender for the
program. Fifty names finally were pulled out of a hat containing
150 eligible homeowners.
   The mortgages are insured by the Federal Housing Administration,
an arm of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and
purchased by the Federal National Mortgage Association from local
lenders who originate the loans.
   A total of 2,500 reverse mortgages are being made available
through local HUD offices through Sept. 30, 1991.
   Mrs. Mason said friends suggested the program to her after
reading about it in a financial magazine, but she originally balked.
   ``All you had to do was mention the word HUD, and I thought of
welfare and low-income housing, and I didn't want any part of
that,'' she said. ``But when they convinced me it wasn't welfare, I
decided to try it.''

   Plans for a meeting between the
leftist government and U.S.-backed Contra rebels were in disarray
today with the two sides asking for delays and Honduras refusing to
attend.
   The Sandinista government reported renewed fighting in eight
provinces, especially near the Honduran border. A rebel source said
hundreds of rebels were retreating back to Honduras, where they are
based.
   The proposed talks at U.N. headquarters in New York would be the
first between the government and the rebels in more than a year. On
Friday, U.N. officials said the meeting was set for Monday and
Tuesday.
   The rebels, however, said they wouldn't attend because of
logistical problems and proposed a week's postponement until Nov.
13.
   A rebel spokesman also said the Contras will not disband until
they are satisfied Nicaragua has moved far enough toward democracy.
   President Daniel Ortega, who proposed the meeting when he
announced the end of a 19-month-old cease-fire this week, said he
wanted a delay, but only until Thursday and Friday. Ortega is
calling for disbanding the rebels, and he has insisted that
Honduras take part in the meeting.
   Honduras, which had declined the invitation Wednesday, refused
again on Friday.
   ``The problem of the anti-Sandinista rebels is Nicaragua's,''
Honduran Foreign Minister Carlos Lopez Contreras said late Friday.
``It is a conflict among Nicaraguans.''
   In Nicaragua, Soviet-made helicopters airlifted Sandinista
troops into remote mountains and jungles for strikes against the
rebels. Defense Ministry sources reported fighting in eight
provinces, especially in the north near the Honduran border. A
Ministry source said there were about 3,000 rebels in the area.
   A rebel source in Costa Rica said hundreds of rebel fighters
were retreating back to camps in Honduras.
   ``Our soldiers scarcely have any ammunition and can't confront
an army as powerful as the Sandinistas that is using all of its
force to annihilate us,'' the source said on condition of anonymity.
   He said fighters remaining in Nicaragua had been ordered to take
cover.
   However, Nicaraguan army Col. Manuel Salvatierra, commander of
troops in the northern provinces of Jinotega and Matagalpa, said
the rebels ``have all they need to fight.''
   ``The Contras ... are not so stupid as to infiltrate the country
without weapons and without ammunition,'' Salvatierra said in
Matagalpa.
   He said rebels had kept weapons sent before the United States
cut off shipments in February 1988. Non-lethal aid, such as boots
and uniforms, continues.
   A hospital official in Jinotega, 100 miles northeast of Managua,
said 14 soldiers had been treated there for battle wounds this week.
   Reporters saw soldiers with wounds from grenade shrapnel and
mortars fired by retreating rebels.
   Ortega, announcing Wednesday that the government was ending its
unilateral cease-fire, said 1,100 guerrillas had infiltrated
Nicaragua over the past three weeks.
   He asked for the meeting to discuss demobilizing the Contras
under an Aug. 7 regional peace plan. That plan sets a Dec. 5
deadline for the rebels to disband.
   The rebels had agreed in principle to attend the meeting. But in
a letter Friday to a commission sponsored by the United Nations and
the Organization of American States they said they could not attend
next week because they did ``not have enough time to make the
logistic arrangements.''
   The letter to the International Commission for Verification and
Support was released in Honduras.
   The Contras also proposed a three-point agenda: a cease-fire by
both sides with verification, an amnesty by the Sandinista
government, and rebel visits to Nicaragua to verify steps to allow
their return.
   ``The date proposed by Ortega is a strategy of his political
party to take us off guard,'' Wilfredo Montalvan, a Contra rebel
director, said in San Jose, Costa Rica.
   ``And if Ortega thinks the only thing that is going to be
discussed there is the unconditional surrender of our troops, he
should forget that, since he is very wrong,'' he added. ``Our
demobilization is voluntary and will (occur) when you can observe
that Nicaragua is taking true steps toward the route of democracy.''
   Ortega, asked if the only topic of the talks would be
demobilization, responded: ``Depending on how the demobilization
agreement progresses, we will be willing to reconsider the
cease-fire.''
   Officials from the Organization of American States and the
United Nations are to mediate the meeting, U.N. spokesman Francois
Giuliani said Friday.
   Roman Catholic Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo of Nicaragua also
has agreed to attend.

<TEXT>
   Seventeen months ago, the state Supreme
Court ordered the release of a mental hospital inmate who had been
held for 31 years on a mistaken diagnosis after allegedly raping
and murdering a 5-year-old girl.
   Since then, authorities have stopped feeding Bernt Murphy the
powerful tranquilizers that hastened his transformation from a
strapping youth to a stooped, palsied man who looks older than his
51 years. But they are reluctant to free Murphy, saying he is
ill-equipped to deal with life on the outside.
   Murphy was 19 when he was arrested in 1957 on the rape and
murder charges. He was ruled incompetent to stand trial, diagnosed
a psychotic, and committed to the state hospital at Provo, 40 miles
south of Salt Lake.
   Doctors at the hospital said in 1972 that he had been cured of
his insanity, but the Supreme Court ruled last June that he had
been misdiagnosed to begin with and must be freed.
   But the step off the hospital grounds remains a giant one for
Murphy.
   In its ruling, the Supreme Court did not establish how Murphy's
release should be handled.
   Murphy has never had a job, has been prone in the past to
violent rages, and has the mental capacity of an 8-year-old,
according to his attorney, Brooke Wells.
   A 12-member committee has been assembled to coordinate efforts
to rehabilitate Murphy. It includes vocational counselors, state
social services officials, hospital personnel and attorneys, and
state officials.
   The man hired to accompany Murphy to his dishwashing job at a
local cafe is just one of the expenses the state has incurred in
the case.
   During his confinement Murphy occasionally burst into rages and
attacked other patients, and George Brinkerhoff, a hospital social
worker appointed to oversee Murphy's transition, isn't yet ready to
``turn him loose.''
   ``I think under the right set of circumstances he still could be
dangerous,'' Brinkerhoff said. ``But he is less dangerous than he
was last year.''
   ``The public has right to be concerned, but Bernt has a right to
adjust to society with dignity,'' said John Anderson, Murphy's case
worker at the Department of Social Services.
   Brinkerhoff and Wells said they hoped he could be freed by the
end of the year.
   In February, officials permitted Murphy to move into a group
care house on the hospital grounds and allowed him to begin his
job, as long as he wore an electronic ankle bracelet while outside
the hospital.
   Three months ago, 3rd District Judge Pat Brian allowed Murphy to
remove the bracelet.
   Wells has been Murphy's attorney for eight years and was the
first to realize he was retarded and challenged state hospital
reports portraying him as a danger to himself and others.
   She said Murphy's original confessions were invalid and that he
was no more than a ``convenient suspect'' in the murder of the girl
and another crime to which he was linked, the 1955 slaying of a
23-year-old woman.
   Public defender Lisa Marcy said Murphy understands that he
doesn't belong at the state hospital, and was beginning to overcome
feelings that no one could help him.
   ``You treat someone like an animal and they are going to act
like an animal,'' Marcy said. ``To see people have faith in him and
treat him with more dignity and respect is really wonderful.''
   ``He's no less human,'' Wells said. ``And he wants the same
things and quality of life like anyone else. He understands now
what is out there.''

<HEAD>Virginia Race Setting Records For Spending</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEAN McNAIR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Virginia governor's race could make
history if L. Douglas Wilder becomes the nation's first elected
black governor, but the contest already has set records for
spending.
   Campaign reports filed by the candidates last week showed
Wilder, the Democratic lieutenant governor, has raised $6.46
million. Republican J. Marshall Coleman, a former attorney general,
has gathered $8.05 million.
   Added to the $7.3 million spent by the two losers in the June
GOP primary, total spending for the election should top $22 million.
   That would make the race the most expensive in Virginia history,
exceeded nationally only by past races in Texas ($33.1 million),
Florida ($24 million) and California ($22.5 million). All are at
least twice as populous as Virginia, which has more than 5 million
people.
   ``It's quite expensive, considering the size of Virginia,'' said
Herbert E. Alexander, a University of Southern California professor
who directs the Citizen Research Foundation, which studies campaign
financing.
   ``But it's also an important race in term of some issues such as
abortion,'' said Alexander, adding ``I don't think $20 million is a
lot'' in a race that could bring the first black governor and set a
national precedent on the abortion issue.
   Wilder, who has been leading in the polls, last month released
campaign ads stating his support for legalized abortion, a position
that many candidates in past years had been reluctant to take a
strong stand on.
   Coleman opposes abortion except to save the life of the mother.
   This year's races for governor in Virginia and New Jersey are
the first since the U.S. Supreme Court last summer gave the states
broad leeway to restrict abortion.
   The New Jersey race has drawn less national interest because
Democratic Rep. James J. Florio has a huge lead over Republican
Rep. James Courter. The New Jersey candidates are limited by law
from spending more than $5 million each.
   Spending on Virginia races for governor started to accelerate in
1981, when Coleman lost to Democrat Charles S. Robb, said John
McGlennon, an associate professor of government at the College of
William and Mary.
   Robb, the son-in-law of former President Lyndon B. Johnson, and
Coleman were able to attract large contributors to the race, in
which spending topped $4 million.
   Four years later, Democrat Gerald L. Baliles and Republican
Wyatt Durrette spent $8.3 million in the governor's race won by
Baliles.
   Some of the largest contributions to Coleman and Wilder have
come from developers in rapidly growing northern Virginia, just
outside Washington, D.C.
   ``These people are not just opening the door, they're buying the
door to the governor's office,'' said Larry Sabato, a University of
Virginia government professor. ``I can't for the life of me
understand why people aren't outraged about this.''

   A slight earthquake jolted the San Francisco
Bay area, but there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.
   The quake, which struck at 11:16 p.m. PST Friday, registered 3.6
on the Richter scale and was centered four miles north of San
Leandro, said Pat Jorgenson, spokeswoman for the United States
Geological Survey in Menlo Park. San Leandro is southwest of
Oakland, in the so-called East Bay suburban area.
   There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries, said
police and fire spokesmen in San Francisco and Oakland.
   The temblor wasn't technically considered an aftershock to the
Oct. 17, magnitude-7.1 quake that devastated the region, said Tom
Flynn, a spokesman for the state Office of Emergency Services. The
big quake was on the San Andreas fault, centered 55 miles south of
San Francisco; San Leandro is east of San Francisco.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of
tremendous damage.

   The city's buses will stop running
entirely unless voters approve a sales tax Tuesday, backers of the
levy campaign said.
   About 60,000 people a day use the buses operated by the Central
Ohio Transit Authority, which serves a municipal area where 1.3
million people live.
   A study last year by the Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission
said the bus system was the sole means of transportation for about
45 percent of the riders surveyed, while 27 percent said they used
it to save money.
   If the 10-year, 0.25 percent sales levy is defeated, the system
will shut down Nov. 19, Susan Scherer, campaign chairwoman for the
Committee to Keep Franklin County Moving, said this week.
   The system, with 308 buses, serves Franklin County, which
includes Columbus, and portions of three surrounding counties:
Delaware, Licking and Fairfield.
   The levy would generate $22 million in the first year and would
cost the average family about 64 cents a week, according to
Scherer's committee.
   The transit authority previously received sales tax support
through a levy that was approved by voters in June 1980. The
authority of the levy ended in 1985, but the sales tax it generated
provided enough funds to run the bus system for three years longer
than expected.
   This year, however, the system was forced to eliminate some
routes, cut the number of buses running other routes, and curtail
its weekend and evening runs, transit authority spokeswoman Joan
Florence said.
   ``We did that in attempt to stretch the dollar to get to
November, to get back to the voters,'' Ms. Florence.
   ``We definitely need a public transit system in central Ohio,
and we would be in dire straits without one,'' said Jonathon L.
York, president of the Columbus Chamber of Commerce, which donated
about $250,000 to the levy campaign.
   Local 208 of the United Transport Workers, representing the 400
bus drivers and 187 maintenance and support workers, is in a labor
dispute with the company, but union members are campaigning for the
measure, said local President Hubert Snead.

   The French government honored some
forgotten heroes of two world wars, the Oklahoma Indians who
confused German codebreakers by speaking over military
communications in their native languages.
   Chief Hollis Roberts of the of the Choctaw Nation and Kenneth
Saupitty, chairman of the Comanche Nation, received the Knight of
the National Order of Merit medals Friday on behalf of the Indian
``codetalkers.''
   Each also received, much to the merriment of the mostly Indian
audience, the traditional kiss on each cheek from Pierre Messmer,
former prime minister of France under President Charles De Gaulle.
   ``We and our people knew what we did,'' said Charles J.
Chibitty, listed on the program as one of three surviving
codetalkers from World War II. ``We didn't need to talk about it.
Comanches don't talk about what they do.''
   But Roberts made it clear he thought it was high time that the
codetalkers' contribution were recognized.
   ``This is something that you won't read in the history books,
but history was made today,'' he said. Several hundred people
attended the ceremony, including Democratic Sen. David Boren and
Gov. Henry Bellmon.
   The codetalkers got their start in World War I when an officer
heard several Choctaws talking. They were quickly put onto the
communications lines to relay orders and information.
   Choctaw, according to the Concise Columbia Encyclopedia, is a
Muskogean language of the Hokan-Siouan group _ something not even
the best-educated German picks up in high school. Comanche is a
Shoshonean language of the Aztec-Tanoan stock.
   Several hundred people attended the open-air ceremony, including
Democratic Sen. David Boren and Gov. Henry Bellmon.
   The military recruited Comanche codetalkers in World War II, but
a former soldier named Schlicht Billy said he and about a
half-dozen of his Choctaw companions just sort of drifted into the
communications area of the Army.
   ``We went to North Africa and from their into Sicily, Italy and
then on to Germany,'' Billy said. ``According to the official
record, we were in combat for 511 days.''

   President Corazon Aquino left today
on a North American trip aimed at projecting a stable Philippines
hours after troops drove off thousands of supporters of the late
Ferdinand Marcos with tear gas and water cannons.
   About 15,000 Marcos loyalists massed late Friday at Camp Crame,
headquarters of the Philippine Constabulary or military national
police. Earlier in the day, more than 25,000 had rallied to protest
Mrs. Aquino's refusal to allow Marcos to be buried in his homeland.
   It was the largest protest by Marcos supporters in the capital
since 1986, soon after he was ousted in a popular uprising and
forced into exile in Hawaii. Marcos, president for 20 years, died
Sept. 28 in Honolulu at the age of 72.
   By the time troops moved in soon after dawn, the crowd had
dwindled to a few thousand. Three news photographers and three
soldiers were slightly injured by stones thrown by the loyalists.
   Police said about half a dozen loyalists were arrested and later
released.
   ``I depart as always with confidence that the safety of the
government is assured in the care of the people,'' Mrs. Aquino
said, shortly before taking off on a Philippine Airlines flight to
Vancouver, Canada.
   Mrs. Aquino, who has survived six armed coup attempts, was also
to visit Toronto and Ottawa and then go on New York, Washington,
Dallas and Los Angeles.
   Aides say she will try to convince North American business
groups that the Philippines is a stable country for investment.
   Troops went on full alert Tuesday and will remain in heightened
readiness until she returns Nov. 13. No coups have been attempted
during Mrs. Aquino's frequent trips abroad.
   Police gave permission for the Friday rally to be held at a
traffic circle in suburban Quezon City, but refused to let
protesters march to military garrisons.
   The protesters, however, defied the order and headed toward Camp
Crame, across a major highway from armed forces headquarters and
the Defense Department.
   They shoved aside about 200 police and swarmed around the camp
gates. Brig. Gen. Rodolfo Biazon, chief of the Manila regional
defense command, agreed to let them stay there until midnight.
   Vice President Salvador Laurel and leaders of the New Society
Movement, Marcos' political party, later negotiated a formal
agreement to let protesters stay until 5:30 a.m. Instead of
dispersing, the remaining loyalists locked arms and jeered when
military officers reminded them of the agreement and shouted ``Go
home! Go home!''
   Two water cannons emerged from the main gate at about 6 a.m. and
sprayed the loyalists, who responded with volleys of stones before
police chased them away.
   ``The military successfully launched its harassment against
us,'' said Salvador Panelo, a protest leader. ``I'd like to
strongly protest this inhuman action of the government against the
protesters.''
   Oliver Lozano, another pro-Marcos leader, said the loyalists
stalled on leaving the camp because not enough transport was
available.
   Camp Crame was the scene last week of protests by national
police troopers angered by government plans to abolish the
organization and create a civilian force.
   Maj. Gen. Ramon Montano, commander of the Philippine
Constabulary, claimed opposition groups were recruiting troopers
for a new coup attempt against Mrs. Aquino.
   Friday's protest capped a 250-mile march by Marcos supporters
from Ilocos Norte, his native province, that took 11 days.
   Mrs. Aquino cited national security in refusing to allow Marcos'
body and members of his family return. Protests by his followers
had been small and peaceful until Friday, however.

   A prison official reviewing what
appeared to be a judge's order to release a convicted forger got
suspicious when she noticed several misspelled words _ including
the judge's name.
   So Michael W. Herndon, serving a 15-year state for forgery,
remains in state prison in Bonifay.
   The order was written in legal style, bore a stamp identical to
those on other documents filed in Duval County Court and had a
signature that looked like that of Circuit Judge R. Hudson Olliff
of Jacksonville, who had sentenced Herndon in April.
   But a Department of Corrections employee noticed that Olliff's
name and the words ``fourth'' and ``defense'' were misspelled.
   Officials believe the document was created in prison and mailed
to someone in Jacksonville, who then mailed it to the corrections
department. The envelope had a Jacksonville postmark and bore
Olliff's return address.
   Prosecutors didn't immediately know if any charges would be
filed in the forgery.
   Olliff said there are no motions pending to overturn Herndon's
convictions of uttering a forged instrument, burglary and battery
of a law enforcement officer.
   Besides, the judge said, ``I don't release people from prison.''

   An unemployed single mother used her bank
card at an automatic teller machine to withdraw $150 to pay her
rent and got a $6,520 windfall.
   Patricia Halling took the money to a police station.
   Halling said Friday she began to panic the night before when the
machine at a downtown bank wouldn't stop spewing $20 bills.
   ``I started hitting the machine, telling it to quit. But the
slot just kept filling up with money,'' she said.
   ``I was in such a state of shock, I didn't know whether to run
away or stuff it back into the machine or what to do. My first
instinct was to walk away from it, but I couldn't do that because
the machine had my card.''
   After giving her 326 $20 bills, the machine stopped and a
message came on the screen: ``Would you like another transaction?''
   Halling hurriedly hit the ``No'' button.
   Halling stuffed the money inside her coat and headed for the
nearest police station. When police officers asked her why she
returned the money, Halling said she told them: ``It wasn't mine.''
   Billings First Bank President Bill Strausburg said Halling would
get a reward, but he wasn't sure what it would be.
   Halling had a suggestion: ``What they could do, instead of a
reward, is give me a job as a security guard.''

   At 8, John Duggan already is a drama
student, and he got to play his own modern version of the
Cinderella story this week.
   The magic of a good report card turned John's usual yellow
school bus into a black Cadillac limousine.
   The two-hour limousine rental Thursday was John's reward for
bringing home a report card with a batch of ``A's'' and only one
``B'' on it, said his parents, Gary and Patty Duggan.
   ``It was all his decision,'' said Mrs. Duggan. She said she
didn't believe her son's limo request at first, but didn't want to
begrudge him the treat.
   When John finished a heavy day of second grade at the Caledonia
Elementary School, he walked out of the building, stepped into the
limo, and told the chauffeur to take him, his teachers and friends
to McDonald's.
   Afterward, John's father told him he won't be able to keep
taking acting lessons at the New American Theater in Rockford
unless he keeps his grades up.
   ``Well, now that we know he can do it, we told him we expect it
of him,'' his father said. ``We made it clear that this was a
one-time deal.''

<HEAD>Researchers Suspend Project on Head Wounds</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Researchers who have shot some 700 cats in
the head to study brain injuries said they temporarily suspended
the Army-funded project that drew protests from animal-rights
activists.
   The six- to eight-week suspension of the research at the
Louisiana State University Medical Center had nothing to do with
protests, said Dr. Perry Rigby, chancellor of the medical center.
   ``The value of doing the research is not in question'' Perry
said. ``Questions have been raised, however, some of which pertain
to the technical aspects of the research, and some of which pertain
to the granting agency.''
   The General Accounting Office, the auditing arm of Congress, is
investigating the project at the request of Rep. Bob Livingston,
R-La., and its report is expected in December at the earliest,
Perry said.
   A panel of LSU scientists will conduct an internal review of the
research in order to respond to the GAO findings, said Dr. Robert
Daniels, dean of the School of Medicine at LSU-New Orleans.
   In the experiment, a cat is anesthetized, part of the front of
its skull is removed and it is locked into a vise. A helium-powered
gun then fires a small steel sphere into the cat's brain from 31
inches away.
   The object is to determine the best treatment for brain-wounded
soldiers, project director Dr. Michael Carey has said previously.
Cary wasn't at the news conference called Friday to announce the
suspension.
   Describing his findings in May, Cary said the experiment has
shown that a bullet wound to the brain stops respiration but, if
respiration is supported artificially, the animal will begin
breathing again on its own.
   Animal rights groups across the nation have called for a stop to
the research, paid for by the Army.
   The Physicians Comittee for Responsible Medicine has asked
Defense Secretary Richard Cheney to stop the project, claiming it
is superfluous.
   The project has brought an estimated $2 million to LSU Medical
Center over the past six years, Rigby and Daniels said. They
estimated that 700 cats had been subjected to the experiments, but
neither would discuss medical conclusions.

<TEXT>
   Former television evangelist Jim Bakker,
who once raised millions of dollars from his followers, will work
in a menial job for 11 cents an hour at the Federal Medical
Center-Rochester.
   Bakker, who arrived at the prison Friday after more than a week
in a federal prison in Alabama, has been sentenced to 45 years and
fined $500,000 for defrauding followers of his multimillion-dollar
PTL television ministry.
   At the Rochester prison, the preacher was assigned to the
310-man general population unit, where he is in a room without
bars, and has access to basketball courts, a baseball field, game
rooms, television rooms and telephones, prison officials said.
   Bakker will live in Building 2, a bright, clean former
psychiatric hospital that now houses the prison's non-medical
inmates.
   Bakker, 49, should get his first job within three weeks and it
probably will be in food service, cleaning tables, washing pots and
pans or some other task, said Julie Alba, acting executive
assistant to the prison warden.
   ``We try to treat all prisoners alike and don't provide
preferential treatment,'' she said.
   Prisoners without medical problems and who aren't considered
serious security risks are assigned to the medical center to do
tasks that can't be assigned to sick inmates.
   Bakker will work seven hours a day, Ms. Alba said. In the
evening, he will be free to move about the floor on which he will
live with 150 men. The room doors, which are solid-core metal,
rather than bars, do not lock.
   The prison lacks guard towers, but is surrounded by a 12-foot
fence topped with razor wire and patrolled around the clock by
guards armed with shotguns.
   Bakker, like all inmates, will be able to receive visitors
Friday through Monday, only in the open visiting room and only
those whose names are on a list he has submitted. No conjugal
visits are allowed.
   Unless Bakker's appeal is successful, authorities have said, he
will serve at least 10 years before being eligible for parole.

   Ten teen-age girls accused of jabbing women
women with pins as they walked Manhattan streets have been
arrested, said authorities who reassured victims the puncture
attacks didn't pose an AIDS threat.
   The girls, all under 16 years old, will be charged with juvenile
delinquency, Deputy Police Chief Ronald Fenrich said Friday. The
girls, all black, chose white women for the peculiar attacks
because they believed they ``would be more easily intimidated,''
Fenrich alleged.
   ``They felt as though it was fun to run down the street and
stick females with a pin to see their reaction,'' Fenrich said when
asked to explain the motive.
   Police have reports 39 women were jabbed with pins as they
walked in the ethnically diverse upper West Side in a series of
attacks that ended Oct. 27. None was seriously hurt.
   Some victims worried they could have been exposed to the AIDS
virus, particularly if hypodermic needles had been used. But
Officer Fred Weiner, a police spokesman, said investigators had
determined pins such as those used on bulletin boards and on the
backs of campaign buttons were used.

   The Red Cross scaled back its emergency
shelters as quake victims found new homes, and two state
legislative committees approved a temporary sales tax increase to
help finance relief.
   Lawmakers at a special session of the state Legislature in
Sacramento on Friday debated dozens of different bills, including
the 13-month, .25 percent tax hike; emergency compensation for
quake victims; strengthening of bridges and other structures, and
tax breaks for quake-ravaged property owners.
   The tax measure won passage on separate 7-1 votes in the Senate
and Assembly revenue and taxation committee.
   Shaky ground continued to rattle local residents. Officials said
an earthquake that registered 3.6 on the Richter scale struck the
Hayward fault at 11:16 p.m.
   The epicenter was near San Leandro, southwest of Oakland, said
Pat Jorgenson, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Geological Survey. It was
the first significant tremor on the Hayward fault since a
4.7-magnitude quake in 1984, she said.
   Police in San Francisco and Oakland said there were no immediate
reports of damage or injuries.
   The devastating Oct. 17 quake, which registered 7.1 on the
Richter scale, and killed at least 64 people, struck along the San
Andreas fault, which runs west of and roughly parallel to the
shorter Hayward fault.
   An emergency shelter at the Marina Middle School in San
Francisco's devastated Marina district closed Friday after 94
people living there were moved out.
   Many of the city's homeless have found new homes, moved to other
cities to take new jobs or been relocated to shelters on Polk
Street and the nearby Army base at the Presidio, said Red Cross
spokesman Kevin Irion.
   There were 384 people in Red Cross shelters in San Francisco on
Friday, said spokesman Bob Page, and a total of 1,514 in the San
Francisco Bay area. At one point after the quake, 6,000 people were
living in emergency shelters.
   A declining population of quake-caused homeless in the East Bay
led authorities to consolidate their shelters in Oakland.
   ``The American Red Cross will continue to provide food and
shelter to those affected by this disaster as long as these
services are needed,'' said relief director Allen Whear.
   Vice President Dan Quayle's wife, Marilyn, toured homeless
shelters in the San Jose area and met briefly with San Francisco
Mayor Art Agnos on the second day of her visit to the area.

   AIDS has become the eighth leading killer of
women of child-bearing age, according to study by the Centers for
Disease Control.
   The study released Friday found that 1,430 women between the
ages of 15 and 44 died of AIDS last year, compared to 813 in 1986 _
a 75 percent increase.
   The statistics put acquired immune deficiency syndrome ahead of
diabetes, influenza and pneumonia as a killer of women of
child-bearing age, according to the study.
   ``What happened to men with AIDS in 1984 and 1985 is happening
to women now,'' said Dr. Susan Chu, a CDC epidemiologist. ``And
it's getting worse.''
   Although deaths of men from AIDS are still more common, the
death rate among men rose just 42 percent over the past three
years, the study shows.
   It found that the rise in the number of women victims could lead
to a big increase in AIDS among children.
   CDC figures show that 1,013 children ages 12 and younger had
died of AIDS as of Sept. 30.
   ``The trends in children tend to parallel the trends in women
because women can infect their children,'' said Dr. James Buehler,
another CDC epidemiologist.
   ``The numbers on women give us a lot of warning,'' Buehler said,
``and we should use it to bring research and newly developed
therapies to bear on pediatric AIDS.''
   Chu said black women are nine times more likely to die of AIDS
than white women. She said AIDS was the fifth-leading cause of
deaths among black women in 1987.
   About half of the women who acquired AIDS through June of this
year did so by using infected needles, she said, while another 20
percent were stricken with AIDS after having sexual intercourse
with an IV drug user.
   As of the end of September 1989, the federal Centers for Disease
Control in Atlanta had recorded a cumulative total of 109,167 cases
of AIDS in the United States, with 64,849 deaths.

   A former circus performer known for his
ability to swallow and regurgitate razor blades was charged with
slashing a prison guard who tried to prevent him from slitting his
own wrists.
   Benjamin Carnesoltas, 35, is accused of cutting the throat of
John Wickizer, 29, an officer at the city prison, causing wounds
that required nine stitches.
   Carnesoltas was indicted Friday on a second-degree assault
charge.
   According to court records, Wickizer and another guard found
Carnesoltas slashing his wrists with a razor blade on Sunday night.
They tried to take the blade away from him, but Carnesoltas
attacked Wickizer.
   Minuard Burt, the prison superintendent, said Friday that
Carnesoltas is well known for his ability to swallow and exhale
various weapons.
   ``When you shake him down, you simply don't find anything,''
Burt said. ``And later he shows up with a blade.''
   Carnesoltas was in prison for a 1987 escape that occurred after
officials took him to a hospital to be treated for self-inflicted
razor cuts.
   Jackson County Assistant Prosecutor Laurel Lamont said that
Carnesoltas learned to swallow and regurgitate blades when he
worked with a circus in Cuba.

   The United States and Japan have started a new
round of economic meetings marked by U.S. advice to the Japanese to
accompany their ``buying up of America'' with more opportunity for
Americans to invest in Japan, officials said.
   The two countries' semiannual subcabinet-level economic talks,
which began Friday, also aired questions about continuing massive
Japanese trade surpluses and U.S. budget deficits, said officials
of both countries who talked to reporters on condition they not be
named.
   The sources said the Japanese side asked why Americans were so
concerned about such investments as Sony Corporation's acquisition
of Columbia Pictures or Mitsubishi Real Estate's purchase of
Rockefeller Center, since as a debtor nation America needs the
capital inflow.
   ``Our attitude was that we welcome foreign investment, but it is
becoming increasingly difficult to defend it in the U.S. against
the perception that Americans do not have the same opportunity in
Japan,'' the U.S. informant said.
   Even though Japan has a powerful economy second only to
America's, it does not even appear on the list of the 15 leading
nations that host foreign investment, the Japanese were told. U.S.
businessmen have complained of waiting for years to get Japanese
approval of investment proposals.
   McCormack's delegation also warned the Japanese that ``political
alarms'' could sound in Congress if recent reports are borne out
that the Japanese trade surplus will resume growing next year and
that excess capacity will prompt Japan to turn from domestic demand
back to exports for economic growth.
   The reply was that Japan would continue to stimulate domestic
demand and boost imports from the United States, especially
high-ticket capital goods, the sources said.
   The two countries agreed on broad cooperation in the forthcoming
round of global trade talks, sources said.
   Richard McCormack, U.S. undersecretary of state for economic
affairs, presided over the talks, which were attended by
representatives of a half dozen departments of the two countries'
governments. Deputy Foreign Minister Koji Watanabe headed the
Japanese delegation.
   Most of the same officials return Monday and Tuesday for the
second session of the Structural Impediment Initiative, talks begun
two months ago in Tokyo on non-trade causes contributing to the $50
billion U.S. trade deficit with Japan.

   An teen-ager whose 9-month-old son died
after being left alone in a hot car was sentenced to a rigorous
probation program that includes boot camp.
   Monica Ann Rogers, 18, was charged with unlawful neglect after
the infant was left in a car at her home for 3{ hours on May 24.
The child died at Greenville Memorial Hospital two days later from
heat-related injuries.
   Retired Circuit Judge Frank Eppes sentenced Ms. Rogers on Friday
to 10 years in prison, but suspended the sentence to five years of
probation, including shock probation _ an intensive, boot-camp type
program _ and house arrest.
   Prosecutor Druanne White said Ms. Rogers initially told
authorities the baby had been in the trailer with her. Later, she
said she left the baby in the car after taking her boyfriend to
work early that morning, Ms. White said.
   The temperature that day was in the 70s or 80s, and there was no
shade over the car, Ms. White said. After leaving the infant in the
car, Ms. Rogers fell asleep in the trailer.
   Ms. Rogers' attorney, Harold Lowery, asked for leniency, saying
Ms. Rogers had led a troubled life. She became pregnant at age 16
and has suffered from hearing loss, poor eyesight, brain damage and
seizures, he said.

   At least 400 barrels of oil spilled
into a bay here when a 12-inch hose broke while a tanker was being
loaded, authorities reported.
   The Panama Petroterminal Co. said Friday that from 400 to 600
barrels of oil spilled into Big Chiriqui Bay Wednesday while the
American tanker Rhapsody was being loaded with crude.
   Company officials said the ship was at the north end of a
pipeline that carries oil from the northwestern United States
across the western end of Panama. Pipeline operations were not
affected, according to Petroterminal, a firm owned by the
government and local and foreign interests.
   No details were available on the extent of the contamination of
Chiriqui Bay.

   A tavern manager said he ignored cries for help
from a woman who was gang-raped by as many as 11 men because his
bar was closed and he didn't want to get involved.
   The woman, 21, told police she was gang-raped and beaten by 10
or 11 men about 3 a.m. Thursday. She was treated for rape and
numerous cuts and bruises at a hospital and then released.
   ``She came banging on the door; she was screaming and
hollering,'' Willie Johnson, manager of the Shangri-La Lounge, told
the St. Louis Post-Dispatch in Friday's editions. ``She was pulling
on the bars of the door.
   ``I told her to go away. A guy picked her up and took her back
behind the alley.''
   Asked what he did then, Johnson replied, ``I didn't do anything.
It might have been a set up for me.''
   Johnson's wife, Ernestine, who owns the tavern, agreed with her
husband's decision to do nothing. Ernestine Johnson had not been
aware of the attack while it was in progress.
   ``In this business, when you're in a cash business, you can't
trust anybody,'' Ernestine Johnson said. ``These women get into it
with men all the time.''
   Police arrested three of the alleged assailants. In addition to
rape, they could face charges of sodomy, armed criminal action and
kidnapping, police spokeswoman Linda Hancock said.
   Sex Crimes Detective Mark Chambers said the victim was also
pistol-whipped and cut on the hand with a knife.
   Willie Johnson said he has been abducted once and robbed twice.
   ``This kind of thing goes on all the time,'' Ernestine Johnson
said.

   Medical authorities in Beijing say they will step
up their AIDS-prevention efforts, including monitoring all Chinese
who have daily contact with foreigners.
   Doctors also will check everyone they see that is infected with
venereal disease for AIDS, the Beijing Health and Epidemic
Prevention Department said Friday.
   The department is calling on all who have had ``random sexual
affairs'' and who think they may have been exposed to the AIDS
virus to come in for confidential check-ups, the official Xinhua
News Agency said.
   The report gave no details on the plans for testing Chinese who
have regular contact with foreigners, or how such people would be
identified.
   Doctors have identified 14 cases of AIDS in Beijing, all of them
foreigners except for one Chinese. About 30 cases have been
identified in all of China.
   Despite the low incidence of AIDS in China's population of 1.1
billion, authorities have stressed the dangers of the Acquired
Immune Deficiency Syndrome, which attacks the body's immune system
and leaves it defenseless against infections and cancer.

   Phillips Petroleum Co. prepared to resume
production at a portion of its Houston Chemical Complex while crews
searched for four workers still missing from an Oct. 23 explosion.
   Employees at the refinery's K-Resin began startup procedures on
Friday, Phillips spokeswoman Patricia Marshall said.
   The K-Resin plant is several hundred yards from the polyethylene
plastics plant which was destroyed by the series of explosions and
fire.
   At least 19 employees of Phillips and several subcontracting
firms died in the blast and the four missing workers are presumed
dead.
   More than 120 employees were injured by the blast. Five remained
hospitalized in good or guarded condition Friday with burns and
other injuries. Phillips officials said the K-Resin plant was not
seriously damaged in the explosion.
   Phillips spokesman Greg Derrick said construction work on a new
polyethylene unit, which was suspended after the accident, should
resume Monday.
   Phillips has been working with area residents and businesses to
settle claims stemming from the accident, spokesmen said. As of
Friday, the company had paid $445,000 in full and partial payments
to 862 of 1,707 claimants.
   Phillips officials believe flammable hydrocarbon vapor from
ethylene and isobutane gases escaped from a leaking chemical
reactor, triggering the explosions.
   About 300 hourly Phillips employees are expected to be back at
work within the next week. About 300 administrative and supervisory
employees already have returned, spokesman Bill Wicker said. About
900 people worked at the plant before the disaster.

   Bombs exploded today outside a private
clinic and at two buildings occupied by left-wing supporters of
Catalonian independence from Spain, causing some damage but no
injuries, officials said.
   The spokesman of the Barcelona province civil governor's office
said no group had claimed responsibility for the three blasts, and
it was not clear if they were related.
   The spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
first bombing took place before dawn in Manresa, a town 25 miles
north of Barcelona.
   The blast damaged a door and hallway of an apartment building in
which the radical Catalonian nationalist group Movement of the
Earth maintains an office, the spokesman said.
   About 20 minutes later, an explosion ripped through offices and
a hallway of the private medical clinic Dexeus in Barcelona,
knocking down doors and shattering at least 30 windows.
   About 40 minutes later, a third bomb exploded in the doorway of
an apartment building in the Barcelona suburb of Sant Boi de
Llobregat, the spokesman said.
   That blast, which caused slight damage, occurred just below the
second-floor apartment of a leader of the Socialist Party of
National Liberation, another nationalist group, the spokesman said.
   Barcelona is capital of the four-province northeastern region of
Catalonia, which in recent years has suffered isolated incidents of
nationalist and anti-nationalist violence.

   Police stormed a car today in which a woman held
her 15-month-old son hostage at knife-point for over 13 hours,
rescuing the boy and arresting his mother, officials said.
   Charges were pending against the woman, 24-year-old Tracy Levis,
who has a history of psychiatric problems and once made a public
suicide attempt, police said. The boy, Brandon Duke, suffered minor
cuts during the rescue and was taken to a hospital.
   His mother had held a 6-to-8-inch hunting knife near his throat
during the standoff. She appeared to be hallucinating and neither
made demands nor gave any explanation of her actions, police said.
   ``We consulted a physician as to how long the boy could go
without any food or liquid,'' said Dan Turner, a police spokesman.
``The doctor said after 15 hours the boy would be in critical
condition. So we took action.''
   Turner said the SWAT team used a ``diversionary tactic,''
including a small explosive device, to take the car by storm and
release the child.
   ``We rattled the car,'' Turner said. ``By the time the mother
knew what was going on, we had already secured the little boy. His
safety was our top priority.''
   The incident began about 3 p.m. Friday, when Ms. Levis' mother,
Barbara Levis, was apparently trying to take her daughter to a
psychiatric hospital, and the boy was with them in the car. The two
women got into an argument, and the elder Ms. Levis fled the car,
police said.
   ``I thought it was an accident,'' said Keith Lampton, who saw
the commotion and called police. ``I looked over and I saw her face
was all painted up like Halloween. She was yelling at her mother
and waving a knife toward her.''
   The woman, whose face was smeared with makeup, was on some type
of medication and told police negotiators she was hearing strange
voices, police said.
   At times, Ms. Levis nuzzled the curly-headed boy, bouncing him
on her knees, patting and kissing him. The one time she came close
to nicking the child with the blade, she immediately drew back the
knife and checked the baby for wounds, said police spokesman Al
Baker.
   Several years ago, Ms. Levis threatened to kill herself with a
pair of scissors or by diving into a bayou before she was tackled
by police and taken for psychiatric evaluation, Baker said.

   Ethiopia is restoring full
diplomatic ties with Israel because of improved Egyptian-Israeli
relations, officials said.
   A total of 28 African nations broke ties after Israel's 1973 war
with Egypt in response to a call for sanctions by the Organization
of African Unity. Egypt is a member of that group.
   A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Friday the
``compelling reasons which dictated Ethiopia's severance of
diplomatic relations with Israel no longer exist.''
   The spokesman cited Israel's evacuation of Egyptian territory
occupied in the war and the restoration of ties between Egypt and
Israel.
   In Jerusalem, Israel's Foreign Ministry had no immediate comment
on the Ethiopian announcement.
   Ethiopia becomes the 10th African nation to restore ties with
Israel since 1982.

<TEXT>
   A U.S.-owned drilling ship with 97
people on board, including seven Americans, capsized early today
when a typhoon with 100 mph winds hit the Gulf of Thailand. All
aboard were missing.
   Rescue workers searched a 600 square-mile area without finding
any trace of the Seacrest's crewmen, said Richard Keller, a vice
president of Unocal Thailand. The oil company called off today's
search because of darkness.
   Thai navy divers planned to continue into the night with the
assistance of lights and remotely operated underwater vehicles,
Unocal spokeswoman Carol Scott said. The company planned to resume
its search Sunday.
   At dusk, a search-and-rescue team was dropped by helicopter atop
the upside-down hull of the 351-foot vessel but the rescuers did
not find any crewmen, Scott said.
   ``They tapped on the part of the hull that is above water,
listening for a signal back, but got no response,'' said Scott, a
spokeswoman in Bangkok for the Los Angeles-based company that owns
the stricken ship.
   Another Unocal spokesman, Barry Lane, said rescue efforts were
hampered by 6-foot waves and 15 mph winds. He said six Thai
fishermen from another boat were rescued late Friday after the
helicopter dropped them a life raft in the seas about 270 miles
south of Bangkok.
   State-run Radio Thailand today quoted meteorological officials
as saying Typhoon Gay was the worst to hit Thailand in 35 years.
   The typhoon struck Friday and developed quickly, giving the crew
of the Seacrest little time to prepare, Lane said.
   ``This actually was a small storm, a squall, and it escalated
very quickly into a tropical storm, and then a typhoon,'' he said.
   Local news reports said at least 12 fishing boats and two cargo
vessels also had capsized in the storm, which was expected to hit
the mainland later today. Thirty-six crew members were missing from
the two vessels, a Vietnamese cargo ship and a Thai freighter.
   Officials said Unocal lost contact with the
Panamanian-registered Seacrest about 12 hours after the storm hit.
   Carol Scott, a spokeswoman for Unical, said in Bangkok that 64
of the missing on Seacrest were Thai.
   The rest were seven Americans, five Britons, four Australians,
three Filipinos, three Singaporeans, two Canadians, two Danes, two
Malaysians, two Indonesians, one New Zealander, one Norwegian, and
one West German, she said.
   The names and hometowns of those on board were not immediately
available.
   Lane said the Seacrest is owned by a Unocal subsidiary and
operated by Great Eastern Drilling and Engineering Co. of Singapore.
   He said most of those on board were Great Eastern employees.
   The Unocal subsidiary, Unocal Thailand Ltd., had aircraft and
ships searching the area. They were joined by units of the Thai
navy and air force.
   Lane said the Seacrest had been operating in the Platong natural
gas field and the crew had been preparing to run casing into a
recently drilled gas well. The vessel drills for both oil and gas.
   He said a 60-foot-high drilling rig was mounted on the Seacrest,
which also carried other drilling equipment. Lane said the ship may
have been too top-heavy to weather such a storm.
   Ms. Scott said the capsized vessel was found about five miles
from the Platong oil processing platform.
   Officials said other Unocal facilities in the gulf suffered only
minor damage and there were no reported injuries. Unocal had more
than 1,100 workers offshore on 46 platforms and 18 vessels at the
time of the storm.
   The company operates five natural gas fields in the Gulf of
Thailand that normally produce about 540 million cubic feet of
natural gas daily. Company officials said the Seacrest first went
into service in 1978.

<TEXT>
   Christian leader Gen. Michel Aoun said
today he had dissolved Parliament because it endorsed an Arab peace
plan without his consent. But lawmakers vowed to defy him by
meeting to elect a new president.
   Aoun, 54, summoned reporters to his bunker command post under
the presidential palace in suburban Baabda, east of Beirut, before
dawn and read a decree issued by his three-man military Cabinet.
   Aoun, whose Cabinet is vying for power with a rival Moslem
government, said he was dissolving the legislature because it
violated the constitution last month when it approved without his
consent an Arab League-brokered accord to end the 14-year-old civil
war.
   The accord was endorsed by 59 of the 63 lawmakers who attended a
special parliamentary session called by the league in the Saudi
resort of Taif.
   Aoun's move was aimed at preventing the legislature from holding
a scheduled meeting in Beirut today to ratify the peace accord and
elect a new president.
   But legislators gathered at a northern Lebanon airbase, Kleiat,
and said they would hold a special parliamentary session today or
Sunday to elect a new president to form a government of national
reconciliation. The session must attract at least 50 of the 73
Parliament members to form a quorum.
   Sources said Parliament Speaker Hussein Husseini, a Shiite
Moslem, was flying to Paris to bring about 28 deputies, most of
them Christians, from the French capital to attend the session.
Aoun has branded them as ``traitors'' and threatened to punish them.
   Twenty-four Moslem deputies today drove from west Beirut to
Kleiat, where they were joined by leftist Christian deputy Najah
Wajim.
   The Parliament session was originally called for 10 a.m. (3 a.m.
EST) at Villa Mansour, the wartime parliament headquarters in the
no-man's land along the Green Line dividing Beirut into Moslem and
Christian sectors.
   Aoun's supporters today called a general strike that paralyzed
the Christian enclave north of Beirut. Thousands of angry Christian
youngsters took to the streets in east Beirut and the port of
Jounieh, burning tires and shouting slogans against Parliament
members.
   Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem who heads the
Syrian-backed Cabinet that rivals Aoun's, rejected Aoun's decree.
   ``This is an unconstitutional, illegitimate act. It's null and
void,'' Hoss said in a statement. ``A president must be elected to
save the country.''
   Under Lebanon's Constitution, only the president can dissolve
Parliament. But Lebanon has had no head of state since Sept. 22,
1988, when President Amin Gemayel's 6-year term expired with
parliament unable to elect a successor because of a Christian
boycott.
   Gemayel, a Maronite Catholic like Aoun, named the general to
head an interim Cabinet until a new president could be elected.
   Aoun has contended he has the powers of a head of state as long
as the presidency is vacant.
   Right-wing Christian deputies in Paris denounced Aoun and
charged in a statement that his ``lust for power could plunge
Lebanon in a new whirlpool of destruction.''
   ``The only way to reunite the government is to elect a new
president who will form a national reconciliation cabinet,'' said
Moslem legislator Jamil Kubbe. ``That's what we're going to do
today.''
   Wajim told reporters that none of the deputies in Kleiat
recognize Aoun as a legitimate head of government.
   ``So any decree he issues is illegitimate. He will not be able
to prevent us from electing a president,'' Wajim said.
   Aoun's decree said approval of the Taif accord was a ``breach of
the Constitution that warrants the dissolution of parliament.''
   He called for three-stage general elections for a new Parliament
in Beirut and its environs Jan. 7, in north Lebanon Jan. 14 and in
east and south Lebanon Jan. 21.
   The current Parliament, the longest-serving in the world, was
elected in 1972 for a four-year term. But the civil war broke out
in 1975 and prevented new elections. The House has since been
extending its mandate every two years.
   There is little likelihood that new elections would be held in
response to Aoun's decree because Syrian troops control more than
70 percent of Lebanon. Syria backs the Moslems.
   Observers in Beirut believe that a new president, if elected,
would dismiss Aoun from all his political and military posts.
   Aoun claims the Syrians, who entered Lebanon under an Arab
League peacekeeping mandate in 1976, are an occupying force.
   The general, who fought the Syrians for six months until an Arab
League-brokered cease-fire took hold Sept. 22, rejected the peace
plan because it failed to provide a definite timetable for a Syrian
withrawal.

<TEXT>
   Backers of legalized casino gambling asked
citizens to ante up with votes today, and one poll puts the odds at
2-1 in favor of the plan to let gamblers bail out this financially
strapped steel town.
   Activists got in last-minute campaigning as the polls opened at
6 a.m. in the city's first Saturday election.
   ``Most of our workers are out and in place,'' Rodney
Sommerville, office manager at the pro-casino headquarters, said
this morning. ``We just sent six vans to the senior citizens'
highrises to help them get to the polls. Everything is falling in
place and all we can do is hope for good results.''
   The non-binding referendum _ a product of months of emotional
campaigning _ would urge the state Legislature to legalize gambling
in Gary. Although rejection by voters could doom the casino effort,
even a strong yes vote might be insufficient to overcome opposition
in state government.
   Casino advocates, led by Mayor Thomas V. Barnes, say gambling
resorts could provide 25,000 jobs and at least $40 million annually
in property taxes for a city staggering under 12 percent
unemployment and the loss of 55,000 residents since the 1970s.
   The opposition, led by a Baptist minister, the Rev. William
Booth, says those figures are unreliable.
   Karen Williams, Barnes' press secretary, said the heaviest
turnout was expected after 10 a.m. The mayor's office was
tabulating early returns as they came in through electronic voting
machines at the city's 18 polling places.
   Opponents point to Atlantic City, N.J., where gambling
proponents promised an economic rebirth, but where local residents
got comparatively few jobs in the gleaming casinos built along the
boardwalk after gambling was legalized there in 1976.
   Atlantic City residents complain the arrival of the casinos
pushed up property taxes, driving away small businesses and the
poor.
   Gary's economy has been drained by cuts in a steel industry
battered by cheap foreign competition. Employment suffered further
as the steelmakers, in an effort to become more competitive,
installed modern equipment that requires fewer workers to operate.
   Barnes said Gary has learned from Atlantic City's mistakes and
vows city residents will get first crack at jobs.
   Property tax pressures will be eased because the prime casino
site is more than a mile from homes and businesses on USX Corp.
lakefront property, he said, unlike in Atlantic City where casinos
moved in next to existing businesses.
   Booth predicts casinos would bring more street crime and even
organized crime to a city that can't quickly beef up a police force
already cut in half because of declining revenues.
   In an opinion poll of potential Gary voters conducted earlier
this week by the Fort Wayne television station WPTA, 68 percent
said they would vote in favor of the gambling measure and 32
percent said they would vote against it. WPTA said the random
telephone survey of 355 voters had a margin of error of 5.4 percent.
   If voters approve casinos, pro-casino forces will try to
persuade reluctant legislators to pass the necessary laws. If the
casino vote fails to win at least a majority, the effort to win
legislative support would become even more difficult.
   Gov. Evan Bayh, whose signature would be needed on any casino
measure, was an early and consistent opponent. He said Indiana
gaming laws, which permit only a state-operated lottery, should be
left unchanged.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert Garton said he senses strong
opposition among his constituents and sees little hope for casinos
if the governor strongly opposes the idea. Indiana gambling
interests may have moved too fast in pushing for casinos,
pari-mutuel betting and dog racing less than one year after voters
struck down a state constitutional provision prohibiting gambling,
he added.
   The Legislature balked at a Gary casino proposal earlier this
year, and the referendum was born of a compromise to keep the issue
alive.

   Hundreds of thousands of people chanting
``freedom, freedom'' rallied in East Berlin today to protest
repression and demand reforms from Communist Party chief Egon
Krenz, who promised a high-level government shakeup.
   As many as 1 million people spread over several sections of the
city, police and pro-democracy activists said, in the largest
demonstration in East German history.
   The remarkable rally came as hundreds of East Germans continued
to emigrate to the West through Czechslovakia, where about 5,000
had packed the West German Embassy in Prague in recent days to seek
asylum.
   West German diplomats announced late Friday that East Berlin had
agreed to let East Germans leave Czechoslovakia legally by any
means they liked. West German border guards said they expected at
least 6,000 arrivals today.
   Yet the tolerance of dissent and the promise of reforms by the
new Krenz government, which replaced the hard-line regime of Erich
Honecker last month, has failed to assauge the simmering public
resentment of East Germany's rigidly controlled society.
   The pro-democracy action began as a peaceful, officially
tolerated march by tens of thousands through East Berlin late
morning, and swelled by hundreds of thousands by midday for the
rally at the city's huge Alexanderplatz square.
   Opposition leaders were cheered and party officials booed and
whistled as they addressed the huge crowd from a platform mounted
on a truck.
   One of the biggest cheers went up when a non-Communist
politician repeated his demand for the resignation of the entire
East German leadership.
   Many in the crowd filling the vast square held up opposition New
Forum banners. The crowd often chanted ``Freiheit, Freiheit,''
German for ``freedom.''
   Other speakers called for free trade unions and one demanded
compensation for victims of the Stalinist terror.
   One Hungarian student was cheered when he called for a union of
democratic movements throughout Eastern Europe. Another speaker
received long applause when he offered apologies to Czechoslovakia
for the Warsaw Pact invasion that crushed the ``Prague Spring'' in
1968.
   East German radio and television carried live coverage of the
protests, noting that hundreds of thousands were taking part.
   East Germany's official ADN news agency said the mile-long
procession that began at 9:30 a.m. included banners and placards
that were both supportive and derisive of recent official gestures
toward reform.
   ``The eyes of the people are on you,'' one banner warned the
leadership, ADN said. ``We want glasnost, not sugar-coating,''
demanded another pressing for an end to state media controls.
   Other banners challenged the leading role of the Communist Party
and demanded ``life without secret police terror.''
   Scores of apartment dwellers draped pro-democracy banners from
their balconies along the march route and applauded the protesters.
   Several elderly East Berliners were seen weeping as the marchers
passed by.
   At Alexanderplatz, the main square in downtown East Berlin,
prominent artists and entertainers called for changes in the
nation's constitution to guarantee free assembly and to abolish the
Communist Party's monoply on power.
   In a televised speech Friday, Krenz announced the removal of
five more Politburo members and pledged other political changes. He
urged citizens to be patient and wait for reforms to take hold.
   ``Trust our policy of renewal! Your place, dear fellow citizens,
is here. We need you!'' said Krenz, who replaced Honecker on Oct.
18.
   Although he did not mention it, Krenz's speech coincided with
the announcement that East Germans in Czechoslovakia would be
allowed to go to the west with their own travel documents.
   Many already in Czechoslovakia, including about 5,000 in the
West German Embassy, began departing early today.
   As Krenz spoke Friday, about 85,000 people demonstrated for more
democracy in at least four cities around the country, ADN said.
   In his 22-minute address, Krenz also announced new laws to allow
draft resisters to serve in the civil service, the formation of a
constitutional court to protect citizens' rights, and plans to
abolish special privileges of high-ranking party functionaries.
   He said that independent, non-Communist groups would have a big
say in forging reforms, but he did not say if opposition groups
would be legalized.
   He also did not mention free elections, one of the major demands
of pro-democracy demonstators in their protests over the past two
months.
   More than 70,000 East Germans have left their country in recent
months, dissatisfied with how the Communist Party has been running
the nation for four decades.
   Krenz's speech means that more than a third of the 21-member
Politburo will have been ousted from the body since he came to
power.
   The five elderly Politburo members who lost their posts were
Erich Mielke, Kurt Hager, Hermann Axen, Erich Mueckenberger and
Alfred Neumann.
   Mielke, 82, had headed the country's feared security apparatus
since 1957. Hager, 77, was the ideology chief, while the
73-year-old Axen had been responsible for foreign relations.
Mueckenberger and Neumann, both 79, held no specific functions in
recent years.
   All had been closely associated with Honecker. Including
Honecker, eight Old Guard party officials have now been removed
from the Politburo.
   Krenz said the five latest members had asked the party
leadership to be relieved of their duties so that ``place can be
made for younger forces.''
   He did not announce any immediate appointments to replace the
ousted men.
   Krenz said the five would be formally released at a meeting of
the party's Central Committee that is scheduled to begin Wednesday.
The meeting could also produce new appointments in the Politburo.

   Authorities opened the former U.S. Embassy
to the public and paraded seven alleged CIA spies before television
cameras today as Iran marked the 10-year anniversary of the
embassy's dramatic seizure.
   Iranians chanting ``Death to America!'' celebrated with ``great
rallies throughout the country,'' according to the state-run Tehran
Radio.
   But despite efforts by radicals to use the anniversary to stir
anti-American passions, turnout at a rally near the embassy in
Tehran was relatively poor.Only 10,000 to 15,000 people gathered at
the embassy. Previous rallies had drawn hundreds of thousands of
people.
   Western and Third World diplomats believe the radicals want to
use the anniversary of the embassy seizure Nov. 4, 1979, to stir
anti-American sentiment to challenge efforts by President Hashemi
Rafsanjani, leader of Iran's so-called pragmatists, to improve
Tehran's links with the West.
   The main speaker was to be former Interior Minister Ali Akbar
Mohtashemi, Rafsanjani's leading rival among the hardliners who
fear boosting relations with the West will undermine the Islamic
revolution.
   The government earlier apparently had been trying to keep
ceremonies marking the anniversary as low-key as possible.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency reported that
Rafsanjani met with officials in charge of rebuilding the southern
city of Khorramshahr, badly damaged in the 8-year war with Iraq,
and told them Iranians' ``energy must be used for reconstruction
... among the most effective ways of combatting arrogance.''
   ``Arrogance'' is a revolutionary euphemism for the United States.
   Officials presented the seven alleged spies at a televised news
conference in a corrugated iron hut next to the main building that
once housed the U.S. Embassy.
   It was the first time foreigners have been allowed into the
sprawling compound since it was stormed by militant ``students''
who held 52 diplomats and other embassy personnel hostage for 444
days, a crisis that helped topple the administration of President
Jimmy Carter.
   All seven men said they had been recruited by the Central
Intelligence Agency while they were abroad. Rafsanjani disclosed in
April that a spy network, including senior military officials, had
been rounded up.
   One of the alleged agents, Bahman Aqaei, said he was recruited
while he was working at the Iranian embassy in New Delhi, India, as
a second secretary in charge of economic affairs.
   Aqaei, the group's spokesman, said they had been trained in
espionage techniques and promised as much as $1,200 a month, a
small fortune in economically troubled Iran, but never received any
money.
   Others said they were recruited in West Germany and Turkey and
underwent commando training at a secret base.
   Correspondents were allowed to film and take photographs during
the news conference, but were not permitted to photograph the
buildings in the compound.
   Bearded young men cradling AK-47 rifles in their arms shepherded
the media group into the compound.
   Teen-age Revolutionary Guards could be seen through the windows
of the main building attending classes. Others played volleyball in
a field in the center of the compound.
   The complex was also opened to the public for the first time.
Iranians were allowed to enter a forecourt in front of the main
building where posters and copies of documents seized during the
takeover, allegedly proving the embassy's involvement in spying
activities, were on display.
   Large signs on either side of the main iron gate to the compound
on Taleghani Avenue proclaimed in big blue letters ``Death to
America!'' in English and Persian.
   The high brick wall around the compound was festooned with
banners bearing anti-Amercian slogans and quotations from speeches
by Iran's late revolutionary leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
He died June 3.

   Thousands of refugees fleeing
an uncertain future in East Germany began streaming into this
border town today, cheering their new freedom and saying they'd
lost hope of change back home.
   The first of a caravan of special trains evacuating more than
5,000 East Germans from Prague, Czechoslovakia, pulled into the
crowded train station here early this morning.
   ``I waited four years for permission to leave legally. But then
I decided I couldn't pass up the opportunity,'' said 27-year-old
Olaf Acksteiner of Cottbus.
   His arrival followed the stunning decision of East Berlin
authorities to let Czechoslovakia open its border with West Germany
to any East Germans fleeing their Communist homeland.
   While the authorized escape channel is unprecedented in East
Germany's 40-year history, Communist Party leader Egon Krenz
appealed to his countrymen to stay and help build a better East
Germany.
   The first arrivals here were greeted on a cold and damp Bavarian
day with two dozen baby carriages, hot tea, blankets and food.
   ``A hearty welcome to you,'' the train station loudspeaker
boomed to the new arrivals. ``The federal border police and the
mayor of Marktredwitz welcome you to the Federal Republic of
Germany.''
   Among the crowd of about 400 well-wishers, one held up a sign
advertising a job: ``I'm looking for a butcher's apprentice.''
   West German diplomats announced late Friday that East Berlin had
agreed to let East Germans leave Czechoslovakia legally by any
means they liked _ simply by showing their East German identity
documents.
   That effectively removed East German barriers on travel to West
Germany for the first time in years. East Germans need no special
permission to travel to Czechoslovakia.
   It was not clear how long the new arrangement would last. It
also was not immediately clear how many East Germans would decide
to take advantage of the opportunity.
   West German border guards said they expected at least 6,000
arrivals today, but some East Germans told reporters in
Czechoslovakia that tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds of
thousands, might take advantage of the chance to flee.
   Krenz, in power only two weeks, has been under pressure to boost
the Communist party's sagging authority. On Friday he announced a
sweeping program of reform and the resignation of five old guard
Politburo members.
   But he made no mention of the decision to allow East Germans to
head west from Czechoslovakia, appealing instead to his compatriots
to stay home and urging them to apply for legal emigration if they
feel they must leave.
   ``Trust our policy of renewal!'' Krenz said in a televised
address. ``Your place, dear fellow citizens, is here. We need you.''
   Since August, more than 70,000 East Germans have headed to West
Germany through Hungary and Bonn's embassies in Prague and Warsaw
since August. At least another 101,000 have emigrated legally to
West Germany this year from the Communist land of 17 million.
   Krenz's predecessor Erich Honecker banned travel to
Czechoslovakia Oct. 3 in an effort to halt the exodus of mostly
young, skilled workers.
   But Krenz lifted the ban Tuesday, and thousands of East Germans
began pouring into Czechoslovakia, many heading for the Prague
embassy.
   Friday's announcement was the third time in six weeks that East
Germany had been forced to permit a huge exodus from the embassy in
Prague. Two waves of about 15,000 East Germans left from the
embassy last month. Their future had been uncertain, however, until
special arrangements were made.
   The thousands who arrived later, after East Germany lifted a
month-old ban on trips to Czechoslovakia, did not face such
uncertainty because of a new East German procedure allowing them to
renounce their citizenship.
   But that process took days, and only about 100 people were
receiving approval daily to go to West Germany.
   The delays would have led to mass overcrowding at the embassy _
a situation that both East and West Germany and Czechoslovakia
apparently wanted to avoid.
   East Germans who have visas for Hungary have been able to go
freely to West Germany via Austria since Sept. 10, when Hungary
opened its western border. More than 49,000 East Germans have used
that route to enter the West, according to Austrian officials.
   Others fled before Sept. 10 across Hungary's defortified border
with Austria and thousands managed to leave by entering the West
German embassies here and in Warsaw.

   Three times a day, observant Jews pray for the
restoration ``speedily in our days'' of the Jewish Temple that was
destroyed by the Romans in A.D. 70.
   The 35-acre site has long been occupied by some of Islam's most
sacred houses of worship, and most Israelis have reconciled
themselves to waiting.
   Extremists, however, are actively trying to realize the dream of
rebuilding the Jewish Temple, and their actions have heightened
tensions that could have repercussions throughout the Arab world.
   Skirmishes broke out in Jerusalem recently when stone-throwing
Arabs protested the first attempt by Israeli Jews to rebuild.
   About 80 Jewish militants of the Temple Mount Faithful tried to
bring in a three-ton cornerstone for a temple near the sacred
Western Wall in Jerusalem's Old City, the last remnant of the
temple torn down by the Romans.
   Police prevented the cornerstone ceremony, but the attempt
ignited riots by Palestinian students in a school just outside the
walls of the Old City. Five policemen were injured by stones and 14
Palestinians were wounded by rubber bullets.
   ``We need to end the Arab occupation of Israel in Jerusalem and
especially on the Temple Mount, which is very holy for us,'' said
Gershon Salomon.
   Salomon, who founded the Temple Mount Faithful shortly after
Israel captured the Temple Mount in the 1967 Six-Day War, vowed in
an interview to continue his efforts to lay the cornerstone and
start rebuilding.
   Another sign of increased movement toward realizing plans for a
new temple was the holding of the first conference on temple
research. It brought about 350 enthusiasts to the headquarters of
the chief rabbinate, where the two top Israeli rabbis of the
Ashkenazi and Sephardi branches of Judaism are based.
   ``If we do not prepare and show God that we want a temple, then
God won't give it to us,'' said Zev Golan, spokesman for the Temple
Institute which sponsored the conference.
   The institute is using a computer to draw up blueprints for
rebuilding the temple as an exact replica of the one destroyed by
the Romans.
   For the past two years, it has also been making replicas of
temple vessels and priestly garments although Golan said his
organization has no timetable or no plans to oust the Moslems.
   At least one yeshiva seminary is training clergy for priestly
rituals in the temple, which was first built by King Solomon and
destroyed by the Babylonians in 587 B.C. It was rebuilt by King
Herod and torn down again by the Romans.
   Orthodox Jews pray daily for a third temple: ``May it be thy
will Lord God, God of our fathers, that the temple be rebuilt
speedily in our days.''
   The problem for builders is that the site of the temple has been
occupied for more than 1,300 years by the golden capped Dome of the
Rock, a shrine marking the spot where Moslems believe the Prophet
Mohammed ascended to heaven.
   Nearby is the Al Aqsa mosque, where Mohammed arrived on his
journey from Mecca. It is the holiest Islamic site after Mecca and
Medina.
   ``The temple was built on the ground of the Dome of the Rock.
There is almost no debate,'' said Menahem Ben Yashar, a professor
of Old Testament studies at Bar Ilan University near Tel Aviv.
   ``Why did the Moslems build it there? Because that was the place
where the temple was. Maybe that's legitimate, that every conqueror
builds his place,'' he said.
   Palestinian leaders say any Israeli move to alter the status
quo, under which Jews are forbidden to even pray on the Temple
Mount, is certain to provoke bloodshed.
   Sari Nusseibeh, who teaches Islamic philosophy at Bir Zeit
University in the West Bank, said Islam regards the Dome of the
Rock as the fulfillment of the Biblical prophecy that a house of
God will rise on that spot.
   ``If this basic belief is challenged, through for example the
setting up of another temple in fulfillment of that same prophecy,
this would constitute an affront to the basic foundations of
Islamic belief,'' Nusseibeh said.
   ``Such an affront would, I think, be a cause for a major
explosion.''
   Most Israelis are aware of Moslem sensitivities, and there is no
mass movement supporting a rebuilding effort.
   But extremist Jewish groups trying to clear the way for the
reconstruction have plotted or attempted to blow up the mosques on
the Temple Mount at least five times since 1967.
   A Christian Australian, later judged insane and deported, set
fire to Al Aqsa in 1969 causing severe damage to the altar. An
American Jew who shot and killed two Arabs on the Temple Mount in
1982 is serving a life sentence.

   The Caspian Sea has risen 54 inches in the last
decade, flooding many coastal towns and baffling scientists, Tass
reported Saturday.
   The water level had dropped three yards in the previous
half-century, and planners put up buildings in the areas where the
waters had receded, the Soviet news agency said.
   ``One can only regret this construction now,'' Tass said. It did
not specify the extent of damage.
   Scientists still cannot predict accurately what changes there
will be in the water level, Tass said, quoting Soviet water expert
Georg Sivoplyas.
   The problems with the Caspian Sea, which borders the Soviet
Union and Iran and harbors most of the world's caviar-producing
sturgeon, contrasted with the plight of the disappearing Aral Sea
about 300 miles to the east.
   The Aral Sea is drying up because irrigation in the surrounding
area uses so much of its water.

<HEAD>Minister's Talk about Talking to IRA Shakes Northern Ireland</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government says its policy in Northern Ireland
has not changed, but a top official has shaken the province by
thinking out loud about talking to the Irish Republican Army.
   While the IRA's political wing quickly welcomed the overture,
the military wing's next move was to try to blow up a police
station.
   Peter Brooke, in interviews marking his 100th day as secretary
of state for Northern Ireland, said no military solution was
possible and that a British government might one day talk to Sinn
Fein, the IRA's political wing. That could only happen, Brooke
specified, if the IRA abandoned its campaign of violence.
   ``What I thought Mr. Brooke was saying was ordinary common
sense,'' John Hume said Saturday. Hume is leader of the Social
Democratic and Labor Party, the province's largest Roman Catholic
party.
   However, there were calls for Brooke's resignation and the
headline in the tabloid Star on Saturday shrieked, ``Surrender to
the IRA.''
   Some complained of the timing, just a day after many newspapers
in Britain had front-page pictures of the small, flag-draped coffin
of Ruthi Islania, a 6-month-old girl shot to death, along with her
soldier father, by an IRA unit in West Germany.
   Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams welcomed Brooke's ``conciliatory
tone'' but rejected any conditions for beginning talks.
   The IRA carried on its war, parking a stolen van packed with
1,600 pounds of explosives outside a police station in Londonderry.
   About 20 pounds of the homemade explosives detonated Friday
night while army experts worked to defuse the bomb, according to
the Royal Ulster Constabulary. No one was injured but there was
damage to nearby cars and homes.
   On Saturday, the Constabulary said, two policemen and two
civilian women were hurt when a rocket was fired at an armored
police vehicle in West Belfast, an IRA stronghold.
   James Molyneux, leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, said
Brooke's statement would encourage Sinn Fein ``to believe they can
bomb their way to the conference table.''
   The Rev. Ian Paisley, leader of the smaller Democratic Unionist
Party, said negotiations ``would be unacceptable to unionists and
an insult to Ulster's honored dead.''
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has said nothing about Brooke's
remarks.
   However, Brooke was lambasted from both sides of the House of
Commons.
   ``I think it's giving comfort to our enemies, and he has told
his own troops that they cannot win. I think it's unforgivable,''
said Ivor Stanbrook, a right-winger in Mrs. Thatcher's Conservative
Party who is usually among the first to react to any political
development.
   Another Conservative lawmaker, Ian Gow, said Saturday that
Brooke had added to the uncertainty and confusion in the province.
   Kevin McNamara, the opposition Labor Party's spokesman on
Northern Ireland, said Brooke's comments ``can only assist the `one
last push' mentality of the paramilitaries on both sides.'' Later,
however, McNamara called Brooke's statement incomplete but
``welcome'' and ``a restatement of the position of all the
political parties ... in the United Kingdom.''
   Sinn Fein, the unionist parties and the Social Democratic and
Labor Party may agree only on their unhappiness with the status quo
in Northern Ireland, where more than 2,700 people have died in more
than 20 years of violence.
   The British government has twice tried direct talks with Sinn
Fein, in 1972 under Edward Heath's Conservative government and
again in 1974-75 under Labor Prime Minister Harold Wilson.
   Brooke hinted that his intention was to promote debate within
the Sinn Fein-IRA ranks about whether their ``armed struggle'' was
working.
   ``There has to be a possibility at some stage of a debate
opening up within the terrorist community as to whether they are
actually securing any return,'' Brooke said in a television
interview.
   Seamus Mallon, a Social Democrat of the House of Commons, said
Sinn Fein's reaction was less important than that of its
supporters, who are about one-third of the Catholic minority.
   ``I would love to see a response, a positive response, from that
(nationalist) community that I represent, saying, `Let's give this
a chance, let's give hope a chance, let's give political
development a chance,''' Mallon said.

<TEXT>
   Swearing devotion to the Hindu god Ram
and a willingness to die for their beliefs, hundreds of young men
set out Saturday with sanctified bricks on a mission that has
spurred Hindu-Moslem riots and caused at least 280 deaths.
   Their destination is Ayodhya, 325 miles to the southeast, where
plans for a new Hindu temple have propelled religious strife to the
forefront of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's battle for re-election.
   From the width and depth of India, convoys of trucks and buses
are heading to Ayodhya in the heart of Uttar Pradesh, India's most
populous state and a bellwether in elections. In their wake,
Moslems and Hindus have shot, stabbed and burned each other to
death.
   ``To put up the bricks for the Hindus, this is important,'' said
Rajesh Kumar, a 19-year-old English student who joined the
procession of seven buses and at least four trucks that left New
Delhi on Saturday.
   ``The name of the god Ram is enough to defend ourselves,'' he
said, then patted a holster containing a brass trident with sharp
spears. ``The blade is less than 4 inches, so it's legally
permitted,'' he said with a grin. ``This is just a symbol, not a
weapon.''
   Some of the young men carried sabers and hockey sticks, which
older organizers hastened to describe as religious symbols or
evidence of youthful sportsmanship.
   On Thursday, ardent Hindus plan to lay the foundation for a new
temple to Lord Ram in Ayodhya next to a disputed shrine claimed by
both Moslems and Hindus.
   Vishwa Hindu Parishad, the fundamentalist group behind the
temple drive, says it has gathered bricks from more than 375,000
cities and towns throughout India and from Hindus in Canada, the
United States and Western Europe. After being blessed by Hindu holy
men, the bricks are borne by believers and festooned with bright
red and orange satin and chiffon, tied up with tinsel and garlanded
with marigolds.
   This joyous celebration of religious right has left a trail of
death in villages where Hindus and Moslems have lived side by side
for centuries.
   Hindu-Moslem clashes are particularly worrisome now.
   With national elections barely three weeks away, both Gandhi and
opposition leader Vishwanath Pratap Singh have been urging
religious harmony while at the same time trying not to alienate the
Hindu fundamentalist vote or the potentially pivotal vote of
Moslems, who make up 11 percent of the population. Hindus account
for 82 percent.
   Gandhi officially launched his campaign Friday in Faizabad, four
miles down the road from Ayodhya, with an accusation that unnamed
opposition parties were ``fanning communal feelings for their
vested political interests.''
   ``Communalism'' is the catchword Indian politicians and news
media use for religious strife in an effort to avoid singling out
specific faiths or being perceived as taking sides.
   Back in New Delhi, Singh of the opposition National Front
coalition was accusing Gandhi's Congress Party of trying to turn
Ayodhya into ``a flashpoint'' of communal violence.
   Many participants in Saturday's send-off of the convoy said they
would vote for the Bharatiya Janata Party. This right-wing Hindu
party is not a member of the National Front but has been making
deals with the front for a share of the Parliament seats to be
determined in the elections being conducted Nov. 22, 24 and 26.
   The young men making the trip, as well as older ones encouraging
them, vowed that the journey would be peaceful unless ``the
Mohammedans'' started something or the government failed to
maintain order.
   In late October, similar ``Ram shila,'' or Ram brick,
processions precipitated several days of Hindu-Moslem clashes in
Bihar state. At least 201 people died by official count, which does
not specify the victims' religions.
   Indian newspapers have given indications that many, perhaps
most, of the victims were Moslems. When the dead and wounded have
been identified, the names have usually been Islamic.
   In addition to the October deaths, about 80 other people have
been killed in Bihar and four other states since August when plans
were announced to build the temple at Ayodhya, revered by Hindus as
Ram's birthplace.
   The New Delhi convoy of trucks and buses, with their load of
5,045 bricks and about 300 men, is to pass through towns with
sizeable Moslem populations.
   ``What can we say about trouble?'' asked R.K. Mathur, a
40-year-old music teacher attired in blue denim jeans and jacket.
``We are going on our mission.''
   Manesh Gupta, a 19-year-old photographer, added: ``If we die, it
is no problem _ 100 percent, no problem.''

   One year after President Bush defeated Michael Dukakis in an
election that sometimes resembled a national referendum on Willie
Horton, prison furloughs are alive and well _ and keeping a low
profile.
   In last year's presidential campaign, Bush ridiculed the
Massachusetts governor for allowing convicted murderer Horton out
on a furlough. Horton raped a woman while free.
   ``We don't let murderers out on vacation to terrorize innocent
people,'' Bush said.
   True to his word, Bush has asked the federal Bureau of Prisons
to further restrict the types of federal prisoners who can qualify
for a furlough. But few state prison systems have changed their
furlough policies, and prison officials are almost unanimous in
their insistence that furloughs make good sense. Many states limit
them to less-violent criminals, however.
   ``It's a non-issue,'' said Jeffrey Washington, a spokesman for
the American Correctional Association. ``They worked for years, and
they'll continue to work, and the only reason they came up in 1988
was because of the election.''
   In most states, furloughs are limited to minimum-security
inmates nearing the end of their terms. They usually have a twofold
purpose: to allow inmates to re-establish ties with their families,
and to allow them to hunt for jobs.
   Most states also allow inmates out for family emergencies,
mainly funerals. But violent felons are typically accompanied by
guards, and sometimes have to attend funerals in handcuffs.
   Few states have furlough programs similar to the one
Massachusetts adopted under a Dukakis predecessor that allowed
Horton, who was serving life without parole, to leave prison on a
weekend pass in 1986. Horton fled, and didn't resurface until he
was arrested for assault and rape the next year in Maryland.
   As a result of the Horton case, Dukakis agreed to stop giving
furloughs to inmates serving life sentences. But that didn't stop
Bush from seizing on the case as a campaign issue.
   For months, Bush used the issue to paint Dukakis as soft on
crime, and made it the theme of a controversial television
commercial that showed inmates parading through a revolving prison
gate.
   During the campaign, Dukakis pointed out that the Reagan
administration had furloughed thousands of federal prisoners. That
has continued under Bush.
   However, the federal Bureau of Prisons has a policy of generally
denying furloughs to anyone convicted of a violent crime. And
bureau spokesman Greg Bogdan said Bush has ordered that policy
extended to include anyone convicted of drug distribution or
illegal firearms charges.
   When the new policy goes into effect, possibly by the end of
this year, it should have ``a significant impact'' on the number of
federal furloughs, Bogdan said.
   Furloughs have remained an issue in a few states, although not
necessarily because of the presidential campaign.
   In Indiana, for instance, furloughs became a major issue earlier
this year when an inmate on furlough was arrested for beating his
former wife to death. Alan L. Matheney was serving an eight-year
term for beating Lisa M. Bianco two years after their divorce and
had expressed continued hostility toward her. Authorities said
Bianco wasn't even warned that her former husband was getting an
eight-hour pass.
   In the wake of that killing, the Indiana furlough program was
suspended for about a month and then reinstated with more stringent
guidelines, cutting the number of participants by nearly two-thirds.
   In Maryland, furlough and work-release programs at the Patuxent
Institution, a psychiatric center, were suspended after a triple
murderer was furloughed and a convicted rapist was charged with
rape while on work release. The work release program was later
resumed after each participant was re-evaluated; a similar review
of the furlough program is under way.
   The Horton case did have reverberations in Texas, where the
furlough policy was similar to Massachusetts'. The state's Criminal
Justice Board voted last month to stop furloughs for inmates
convicted of homicides in ``crimes of passion.''
   But in most states, the uproar over furloughs died with the
Dukakis campaign. And in one state, North Dakota, the furlough
program was actually expanded.
   North Dakota's new ``temporary meritorious leave program'' was
instituted last November, while the presidential campaign was still
fresh in voters' minds. Under it, inmates in the nation's smallest
prison system are being furloughed at twice the previous rate.
   ``Every single one has been successful,'' Warden Tom Powers
said. ``We feel pretty good about that program, and we feel pretty
good that we had the courage to do that when, politically, maybe
that wasn't the most astute thinking.''

<TEXT>
   Business owners and
residents of St. Croix on Saturday protested President Bush's plan
to withdraw 1,100 federal troops that were sent to the island to
quell looting after Hurricane Hugo hit.
   The United Concerned Citizens of St. Croix, formed last week to
protest the plan, said it joined the St. Croix Chamber of Commerce
and the Board of Realtors to lobby the White House and Pentagon
urging Bush to rescind the order.
   The Defense Department announced Thursday troops would all be
withdrawn within 20 days. The soldiers, mostly military police,
arrived Sept. 21 to restore order, four days after Hugo had passed
and most stores were looted.
   In a full-page ad in the daily St. Croix Avis on Saturday, the
group urged residents to phone the White House and Pentagon to tell
authorities ``that we Crucians appreciate and want continued
military presence.''
   ``We have no electricity and telephones and we want to be safe
on the island,'' the ad said.
   The group, which represents shop owners and residents, said that
by Friday night more than 300 calls had been made to the Pentagon
and the White House pleading for the troops to stay.
   Chamber of Commerce President Jan Hanley on Friday accused Gov.
Alexander Farrelly of reneging on his promise to not request the
troop withdrawal until power and telephones were restored.
   The St. Croix Board of Realtors in its annual meeting Friday
also denounced the withdrawal order and demanded the troops stay
until vital services are restored.
   A spokesman for the 16th Brigade Batallion Command, one of the
units dispatched to St. Croix, said Friday night that a small
contingent of the National Guard would arrive Nov. 13 to replace
the federal troops.
   Hugo destroyed most homes and caused more than $500 million in
damage to St. Croix, an island of 50,000. It killed an estimated 56
people in the Caribbean and 29 on the U.S. mainland.

<HEAD>No Clear Majority Seen in Greek Elections Sunday</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NIKOS KONSTANDARAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of thousands of Greeks left the
capital for their hometowns to vote Sunday in the second national
elections in five months. Polls indicated no party would win a
majority.
   The leader in opinion polls, the conservative New Democracy
party, was hoping for its first clear-cut parliamentary victory
since it lost to the socialists led by former Premier Andreas
Papandreou in 1981.
   But the socialists and another party, the Communist-led
Coalition of the Left and Progress, were expected to get a sizeable
share of the vote and possibly deny New Democracy a majority.
   In such a case, difficult negotiations would open among the
three main parties, which have widely differing political views.
Some feared the country could face several more months of political
gridlock.
   The day before the election, Greeks followed the tradition of
returning to the towns where they grew up to vote. Police said
about 500,000 people had left the capital of nearly 4 million
people by noon and that 22 people had died in traffic accidents
nationwide.
   Extra airline flights were scheduled and ships ferried voters to
the islands. Voting is compulsory.
   Campaigning ended Friday night to allow voters the usual ``day
of reflection'' before balloting.
   In the last national elections in June, New Democracy finished
first but failed to gain a majority of the 300 seats in the
one-chamber Parliament.
   The conservatives formed an unprecedented alliance with the
Communist-led Coalition to end Papandreou's 8-year-old government.
   The alliance assigned itself a mandate of investigating charges
of corruption in the former government, and it resigned in early
October after indicting the charismatic Papandreou and five former
ministers.
   Papandreou, 70, was indicted on charges of authorizing
widespread telephone wiretaps while in office and of complicity in
the embezzling of $210 million from a private bank.
   The left-right alliance did not address foreign policy issues
and left many other major governmental issues on the back burner,
where they might stay for several more months if Sunday's elections
produce no clear winner.
   The Communist-led coalition has said it will not work again with
the conservatives and will only form a coalition with Papandreou's
Panhellenic Socialist Movement if Papandreou resigns as head of the
party he created.
   Papandreou, who became famous for his criticism of the United
States and support for Third World causes, has said he will not
resign. The former premier still enjoys considerable support for
the leftist domestic programs he introduced.
   The respected EURODIM polling firm released results Friday
showing a slight increase in support for New Democracy and
Papandreou's party, known as PASOK, since the June elections.
   The poll indicated New Democracy would get 46 percent of the
vote and PASOK about 40 percent, with the rest going to the
Coalition, smaller parties and independents.
   It showed the Coalition dropping slightly from the 13 percent it
gained in June.
   The simple proportional voting system makes it difficult for
large parties to gain an overall majority but helps small parties
enter Parliament.
   The indications that New Democracy might fall just short of its
target raised the possibility of yet another set of elections.
   But the party's leader, Constantine Mitsotakis, told the Flash
commercial radio station Friday he would try to form a government
even if deprived of a majority. He did not indicate whose support
he would draw on.
   Mitsotakis, 71, advocates closer ties with the West and a
smaller government role in the economy.

   Libya's leader, Col. Moammar Gadhafi, assailed the
U.S.-Soviet decision to hold a shipboard summit in the
Mediterranean, saying it could be viewed as ``naval muscle
flexing,'' Libya's official news agency said Saturday.
   ``This much publicized meeting will be alarming to the peoples
of the Mediterranean,'' the JANA agency quoted the Libyan leader as
saying.
   President Bush is to meet with Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev on Dec. 2 and Dec. 3 on U.S. and Soviet naval vessels off
Malta, an island republic 220 miles north of Libya.
   Gadhafi said he supported a superpower summit but objected to
the setting of the upcoming meeting.
   ``A meeting on a naval vessel is an ugly production,'' Gadhafi
said in the JANA dispatch monitored in Rome. ``Moreover, this
meeting may be interpreted as a sort of naval muscle flexing in the
Mediterranean.''
   Gadhafi frequently criticizes the U.S. government, which has
accused him of supporting international terrorism. Citing terrorist
attacks, the United States sent planes to bomb the Libyan cities of
Tripoli and Benghazi in April 1986.
   Gadhafi has rarely criticized the Soviets. Libya has been a
major purchaser of Soviet military equipment for years.

<HEAD>HHS Secretary Stays Out of Sight on Abortion Issues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As the political fever over abortion rises,
the head of the federal department most affected is staying out of
sight.
   Louis Sullivan, the secretary of the Department of Health and
Human Services who stumbled into Washington politics over the
issue, has kept a low public profile in the abortion debate.
   Last week, Sullivan quietly signed off on his chief health
official's recommendation to extend indefinitely a ban on federally
funded research using fetal tissue from intentional abortions.
   Earlier, in the debate over liberalized rules for Medicaid
abortions approved by Congress but vetoed by President Bush,
Sullivan's only involvement was to write members of Congress
outlining the administration's opposition, according to his staff.
   He flexed his muscle recently to win assurances from the White
House that an abortion ``litmus test'' would not be applied to
candidates for top medical jobs in the department, and passed that
word to the medical community in a speech last weekend.
   Some say Sullivan is better off steering clear of the abortion
issue.
   ``If he winds up letting the White House take the lead in
forming consistent pro-life positions ... he will largely escape
the controversy and be able to focus'' on his own issues, said Kate
O'Beirne, deputy director of domestic policy studies at the
Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank.
   Others say his low profile may be evidence that his early
waffling on abortion has not been forgotten and that he is being
watched closely by right-to-life conservatives.
   ``The question is how hobbled he will be by the far right,''
said a lobbyist who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   A physician and the only black in Bush's Cabinet, Sullivan has
concentrated on improving the health of pregnant women, infants and
minorities. He often says the challenge of Bush's pledge for a
``kinder, gentler nation'' will be met by his department.
   ``He's making slow, steady progress, but I don't see any
indication that he's found his feet,'' said Stuart Butler, director
of domestic policy studies at the Heritage Foundation.
   ``There's still no sign of a clear agenda,'' Butler said, adding
that unless Sullivan finds his stride within the next six months,
he will lose an opportunity to carve out his own policy strategy.
``There are pressures developing that will set the agenda for him
if he doesn't do it himself.''
   Some analysts say Sullivan has done little more than tinker
around the edges of a massive health care problem. Medical costs
are skyrocketing and soaking up more and more of the federal
budget, while access to medical services for the poor is being
curtailed to cover the shortfalls. Meanwhile, an estimated 35
million Americans lack any kind of health insurance.
   Hampering any administration efforts in this area, many say, is
that 10 months into the Bush administration, still no one has been
nominated to head the Health Care Finance Administration, which
oversees Medicare and Medicaid.
   Sullivan was a political novice when he came to Washington from
a small predominantly black medical college in Atlanta that he
served as founding president.
   Stuart Rothenberg, a political analyst with the conservative
Free Congress Foundation, said: ``He came in as an outsider and
he's still an outsider, and he'll only be effective when he makes
that jump.''
   At a closed-door breakfast meeting with about 20 Republican
House members and staffers last summer, Sullivan read verbatim from
a prepared text, giving an overview of the health care problems in
the country.
   ``We wanted real nitty, gritty stuff,'' Rep. Jack Buechner,
R-Mo., complained later. ``We didn't want the Rotary Club speech.''
   Some say Sullivan is spreading himself too thin by spending so
much time _ as many as 10 days in one month _ on official business
outside Washington.
   ``You're not going to change national policy in Butte, Montana,
or for that matter at the Illinois medical association meeting,''
Buechner said.
   Sullivan declined repeated requests to be interviewed for this
article.
   Asked about the criticisms, HHS spokeswoman Kay James said
Sullivan sees his job as one of ``taking the health messages out to
the grass roots.''
   ``He's carving out a place for himself. He's exerting himself in
policy debates inside the administration and on Capitol Hill, and
he is being listened to,'' she said.
   Late in the debate over Medicare catastrophic illness benefits,
with the program threatened with repeal, Sullivan broke from the
hands-off approach of the White House to declare support for a
proposal that would keep the core benefits intact.
   Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said
the action ``substantially strengthened'' Sullivan's credibility on
Capitol Hill. ``It takes a while but he's learning and he's being
educated in the process.''
   As for abortion, it is ``not an issue with which Sullivan is
entirely comfortable,'' and the administration does ``not want to
reopen any wounds,'' said Michael Schwartz, a resident fellow in
social policy at the Free Congress Foundation.
   While there is some dispute on how visible a Cabinet secretary
should be on as controversial an issue as abortion, Henry Aaron, a
senior fellow at the liberal Brookings Institution and a former
official in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare during
the Carter years, said, ``It's hard to see that it's not a central
policy concern for the person who is HHS secretary.''
   Shortly after he was chosen for the job by longtime friend
George Bush, Sullivan got into trouble with the political right by
telling an Atlanta newspaper he favored a women's right to
abortion. Soon afterward, he told a senator he favored the Supreme
Court's 1973 decision legalizing abortion.
   Though he quickly retreated both times, the result was the
appointment of some solidly anti-abortion top aides to work
alongside him.
   Among the first of the HHS appointees were Constance Horner as
undersecretary, a loyal conservative from the Reagan
administration; James, a former public affairs official for the
National Right to Life Committee, as assistant secretary for public
affairs; and James Mason, former head of the Centers for Disease
Control in Atlanta whose anti-abortion stance was well known, as
assistant secretary for health. Mason oversees the Public Health
Service, which includes the CDC, the National Institutes for Health
and the Food and Drug Administration.
   Sullivan's choices to head the department's welfare agency and
the Health Care Financing Administration both ran into conservative
opposition and both candidates eventually withdrew their names.
   Some say the lack of assistant secretaries at those agencies and
others is hampering Sullivan's ability to set a policy agenda.
   ``You get a sense of a real vacuum in the welfare area,'' said
Bob Greenstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
   Some lay the blame for the slow pace of appointments at Bush's
doorstep. But others say it also suggests Sullivan's lack of clout
with the White House and his inexperience in Washington politics.
   ``It's a different kind of politics raising money for a medical
school than trying to build a policy agenda and fight for it within
an administration that, like other administrations, is torn 20
different ways with competing interests,'' said political analyst
Rothenberg.
   Sullivan has been talking to experts and analysts outside the
government about potential initiatives, several analysts said, and
they said he is positioning himself to propose some major new
programs.
   ``We have not seen his agenda, (but) I think we are going to,''
said Doug Besharov, resident scholar at American Enterprise
Institute for Public Policy Research.

<HEAD>Four Ex-Presidents Are Untapped Resource</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The United States has more ex-presidents now
than at any time since 1861. And with the expanding human life
span, this abundance of former chief executives is likely to
persist.
   Yet no mechanism or institution exists to tap the collective
resource of these retired officials, most of whom return to private
life at a relatively young age and with a wealth of experience of
which few can boast.
   Ronald Reagan is back from a lucrative visit to Japan. Richard
Nixon just conducted his sixth nostalgia pilgrimage to China. Jimmy
Carter is busy reconciling rebels and governments. And Gerald Ford
divides his time between the golf course and boardrooms of several
large companies.
   The United States is one of few Western democracies where former
leaders are relegated to such retirement.
   ``It's symptomatic of American culture,'' said Barbara
Kellerman, a political science professor and dean of graduate
studies at Fairleigh Dickinson University.
   ``When someone's star has descended, we tend to lose interest in
them,'' she said. ``But it's an inordinate waste that such
collective experience is lost.''
   In parliamentary systems, former prime ministers generally
resume their seats in the legislature and continue to play a role
in their countries' political scenes.
   In Britain, there's the House of Lords which serves as an
advisory chamber to the House of Commons where legislation is
enacted. The upper house, whose doors were once open only to
hereditary peers, has evolved into a chamber of meritorious service
which also accords membership to distinguished actors, writers and
other professionals.
   There have been several proposals to establish a similar
advisory body in the United States, sort of a council of elders,
which would make use of the talents of ex-presidents and other
elected officials. A suggestion was even floated to make former
presidents non-voting members of the Senate.
   But none of these ideas ever left the rarified air of academe.
   The four ex-presidents have never acted in unison and the only
visible joint action taken by Carter, Ford and Nixon was their 1981
trip to Cairo for the funeral of the assassinated Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat.
   Carter and Ford have teamed up on several projects, including
formulation of a list of recommendations to President Bush on
reducing the country's budget deficit and other top national
priorities.
   The two former leaders also traveled to Panama to monitor the
May 7 elections, which were widely believed to have been rigged by
Panamanian Gen. Manuel Noriega. But Ford left before the balloting,
citing a previous commitment.
   Earlier former presidents seem to have been more prominent in
public life after retirement.
   Dwight Eisenhower's advice was sought often by two of his
successors, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson. Eisenhower received
regular intelligence briefings from the CIA.
   Herbert Hoover, who left the presidency in 1933 with a dismal
image from his handling of the economic depression, was honorably
reinstated into public life in the late 1940s by then-President
Harry Truman. Hoover headed two commissions on reforming the
structure of the federal government and conducted Truman's postwar
food relief operations.
   Carter also left office in defeat, with an image of weakness and
indecisiveness over the handling of the American hostages held by
Iranian extremists in Tehran.
   Yet in recent years, Carter has undertaken numerous domestic and
foreign policy projects, leading many scholars to say Carter
performed better as an ex-president than when he lived at the White
House.
   Carter appears to have has fared better under Bush than under
Reagan, who had defeated Carter's bid for re-election. Carter's
recent mediation of peace talks between Eritrean rebels and the
Ethiopian government earned him plaudits from the administration.
Carter kept the State Department closely informed of the progress,
officials said.
   ``The Reagan administration was impatient with Carter over his
views on Nicaragua and Panama,'' which were far more liberal than
the conservative Reagan ideology, said Daniel Franklin, a political
scientist at Colgate University.
   Reagan reportedly ordered the CIA to stop the regular briefings
for Carter and denied him access to other official events, Franklin
said.
   Reagan did confer privately with Nixon, whose ideology was more
palatable to him than Carter's, but generally kept him at a
distance to avoid being linked with the president who was forced to
resign by the Watergate scandal. Nixon's books on foreign policy
were required reading at Reagan's National Security Council.
   Bush has rarely conferred with Reagan, despite pronouncements
after his election that he owed everything to his predecessor.
Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan had reported to
Bush by telephone this week about his trip to Japan.
   Bush also barely paid any attention to the Carter-Ford
recommendations, said Ford, adding that he was ``somewhat
disappointed'' in the lack of response.
   But Ford, in a recent speech to schoolchildren, rejected the
idea of a formal structure to make use of ex-presidents. ``Let
ex-presidents decide what interest to pursue, what contributions to
make, on their own.''
   Carter is returning to Washington this weekend for a reunion
Sunday with his vice president, Walter Mondale, and dozens of other
officials from his administration. On Monday, Carter will
participate in a forum on resolving conflicts around the world.

<HEAD>Report: Pentagon Still Resists Off-The-Shelf Purchases</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite 20 years of prodding, the Pentagon
still buys too few commercially available products and ends up
paying more than necessary for everything from food to automotive
parts, a congressional study says.
   The Department of Defense too often orders products exclusively
for military use instead of purchasing them off the shelf, said the
report by the Senate Governmental Affairs subcommittee on oversight
of government management, chaired by Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich.
   ``The process of designing a unique product from scratch can be
extremely expensive, particularly when the product is purchased in
limited quantities,'' the report said.
   Moreover, the Pentagon's quality standards _ justifiably
stringent for weapons systems and other items developed solely for
the military _ are often unnecessary for products already in common
use, the report said.
   ``As a result, there are numerous examples of extraordinary
prices charged to the government for ordinary products _ from the
$640 toilet seat to the $7,622 coffee maker,'' it said.
   Pentagon spokesman David Thomas said Friday night he was not
familiar with the report and could not comment.
   Levin sponsored a provision in the pending 1990 defense
appropriations bill to streamline requirements for private sector
contractors wishing to sell to the Pentagon. He said the
subcommittee's probe showed the Pentagon had not done enough to
implement a 1986 congressional requirement to remove impediments to
greater use of commercial products.
   Implementing the report's proposals, he said, ``would go a long
way to streamline the federal procurement system and save taxpayer
dollars,'' Levin said.
   A commission in 1972 first urged the Pentagon to make greater
use of commercial products, a recommendation echoed by numerous
subsequent studies. Then-President Reagan issued an executive order
to that effect in 1982.
   In its 1986 report on defense management, the Packard Commission
said the Pentagon should develop custom-made products only when
those commercially available are ``clearly inadequate to meet
military requirements.''
   The Pentagon habitually overstates requirements for products it
uses, and does so in such exacting detail that many contractors
don't even submit bids, the report said.
   For example, the military demanded that 5-cent O-ring seals for
common brake parts be packaged in an airtight box worth $2, said
Robert Rossow of Midland Brake Inc., based in Owosso, Mich.
   Gregory Saunders, the Pentagon's assistant for commercial
acquisition, testified at a June 1 hearing that detailed
specifications are intended to weed out shoddy products and
fly-by-night operators.
   The report makes 16 recommendations to the Pentagon, some of
which would be required under the provision Levin inserted into the
defense appropriations bill. A joint conference committee approved
the bill last week. It still faces House and Seante floor votes,
and if passed it goes to President Bush for his signature.
   Among the recommendations:
   _Before signing a contract to develop a new product, conduct a
cost analysis and make sure no suitable commercial product is
available.
   _Change regulations that make unnecessary demands on contractors
and otherwise discourage use of acceptable commercial products.
   _Use alternative approaches to quality assurance, such as
commercial warranties and rewarding contractors with a proven
record of quality performance.
   _Establish a training program to help military procurement
officials identify worthy commercial products.

   Supporters of a plan to salvage vestiges of
Medicare's catastrophic illness plan say they're gaining ground as
Congress weighs competing proposals to repeal the program or scale
it back dramatically.
   The verdict is anxiously awaited by 33 million elderly and
disabled Americans, whose Medicare costs and coverage for next year
remain undecided with less than two months left in 1989.
   Pushed into retreat by a firestorm of protests from senior
citizens who said the catastrophic program's costs outweighed its
benefits, the House in early October voted to scrap the program,
and the Senate to preserve only limited benefits.
   Since then, work toward a compromise acceptable to both chambers
has been sidetracked by the protracted debate over deficit
reduction legislation and efforts to reduce the capital gains tax.
   Legislators hope to break the logjam this week and attach a
catastrophic compromise to a crucial debt-limit extension requiring
swift approval.
   The Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act, enacted last year,
offers elderly and disabled Americans expanded coverage against the
high costs of prolonged illness, with the benefits being phased in
over several years.
   The program is paid for by higher Medicare premiums on all but
the poorest beneficiaries and a surtax that affects the 40 percent
of elderly Americans who pay more than $150 a year in income tax.
The surtax, which is capped at $800 a person for the wealthiest
seniors this year, has been the focal point of senior citizen
protests.
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., has major senior citizen groups
backing his Senate-passed plan to wipe out the surtax, cancel new
drug and doctor benefits, and preserve expanded hospitalization
coverage and a few other benefits.
   McCain said there is a good chance Congress will preserve
vestiges of the program while eliminating ``the obvious object of
the anger, the surtax.'' He said there is growing support among
House members for the Senate's proposal.
   One of the key advocates of repeal in the House, Rep. Bill
Archer, R-Texas, has indicated he could accept a compromise that
continues some benefits so long as the surtax is eliminated.
   But another sponsor of the repeal plan, Rep. Brian Donnelly,
D-Mass., still believes Congress ``should go back to square one and
begin again,'' said spokesman Gary Galanis.
   John Rother, legislative director for the American Association
of Retired Persons, which fought unsuccessfully to retain the full
catastrophic program, expressed hope that ``as people get a little
more rational and a little less emotional,'' they will chose the
scaled-down program over outright repeal.
   The National Association of Retired Federal Employees, a major
critic of the surtax, is supporting the McCain plan but ``there
won't be any great sorrow'' among its members if the whole package
is repealed, said spokesman Denis Harrington.
   The uncertainty over the future of the program has left the
government and private insurers unable to gear up for whatever
benefits and premiums they will be administering in just a few
months.
   ``What we've had to do is continue to operate under the current
law, until and if any change takes place,'' said spokesman Dennis
Siebert at the Health Care Financing Administration, which
administers Medicare.
   Linda Jenckes of the Health Insurance Association of America
told a House subcommittee last week that ``with 1990 just two
months away, (companies) are anxiously awaiting a final outcome''
so they can adjust benefits and rates on ``medigap'' policies that
supplement Medicare coverage.
   Jenckes said Medigap prices were likely to rise 7-12 percent in
1990 due to rising health costs even if the catastrophic package
was untouched, but the increases can be expected to average 15-20
percent if the McCain plan passes and 20-25 percent if Congress
repeals the whole program.
   Some advocates for the elderly have expressed concern that
medigap rates will rise even more sharply and that companies will
use the repeal of catastrophic benefits as an excuse to boost
prices more than is justified.

<HEAD>Police Battle Albanian Separatists in Yugoslav Province</HEAD>

   Hundreds of ethnic Albanians battled
security forces on Saturday in the latest round of violent
demonstrations against the trials of 15 Albanian separatists.
   It was the sixth day of unrest throughout cities in the province
of Kosovo, which ethnic Albanians say native Serbians are trying to
control.
   Several hundred demonstrators clashed with police in the town of
Podujevo, 20 miles north of Pristina, Kosovo's capital, said a
local journalist who asked to remain anonymous. Police warned
motorists to avoid the road to the city.
   The community of 30,000 people, most of them ethnic Albanians,
was the scene of violent clashes between security forces and
demonstrators late Friday. One person was believed to have died,
the journalist told The Associated Press.
   There was no confirmation of the death. Earlier police reports
said three ethnic Albanians died in Kosovo since the latest unrest
began Monday.
   Delo, a newspaper in the northern city of Ljubljana, quoted a
human rights observer as claiming he saw six ethnic Albanians
killed by police in Pristina on Thursday.
   A judge from Paris, Antoine Garapon, head of a delegation of the
International Federation for Human Rights, said he and two
associates were told by police they would be killed unless they
left Pristina, Delo reported.
   In the Kosovo city of Urosevac, several hundred demonstrators
gathered on the main street and pelted police with stones. Police
dispersed the protesters, the state news agency Tanjug reported.
   The unrest in Yugoslavia's poorest region was sparked by the
trial of the southern province's popular former Communist chief,
Azem Vlasi, and 14 other leaders of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian
majority.
   They have been charged with ``counterrevolutionary activity''
for campaigning to win Kosovo's secession from Yugoslavia.
   The defendants are also accused of inciting demonstrations by
ethnic Albanians who opposed constitutional changes in the Yugoslav
republic of Serbia giving it tight control over Kosovo. At least 25
people died in the protests.
   Kosovo, which borders Albania, is administratively a part of
Serbia but enjoyed wide autonomy before the enactment of the
constitutional amendments. More than 85 percent of Kosovo's 1.9
million inhabitants are of Albanian origin.
   The violence has highlighted the complex regional, political and
ethnic divisions in this troubled nation, which consists of six
republics and two provinces.
   Leaders in the republic of Slovenia and other republics have
criticized what they say are moves by Serbia to increase its
influence over the Yugoslav federation.
   Authorities in Serbia and Kosovo denied the trial is political
and have claimed that Slovenia has instigated the demonstrations.
   Serbian students in many Kosovo towns are staying away from
classes ``because of the tension,'' Delo reported Saturday.
   Cars bearing Serbian license plates have been stoned by
demonstrators in several Kosovo towns.
   Forty passengers on a Serbian bus were slightly injured when
about 200 demonstrators attacked their vehicle in Podujevo on
Friday, Belgrade's Politika daily reported. A Serbian bus company
decided to cancel all night routes to Kosovo towns after three of
its vehicles were demolished by protesters.

   When a robber shot a pregnant suburban woman to
death and wounded her husband as they went home from a childbirth
class, the horror of the crime riveted residents, lawmakers and
activists.
   But is Boston becoming more dangerous? The statistics and local
officials say no.
   ``Boston is one of the safest cities in the country,'' said City
Councilor David Scondras. ``The reality is that we are a
class-segregated society that focuses on the middle and
upper-middle class.''
   Carol Stuart, 30, a lawyer who was seven months pregnant, was
shot in the head by a man who held up the couple in their car Oct.
23 near a hospital in the Roxbury section.
   The drama of rescuers' attempts to find the couple,
tape-recorded by the emergency phone system, drew national
attention. Stuart's husband called police on his car telephone and
desperately tried to tell them where he was. During the lengthy
exchange, Stuart watched his wife's life ebb away.
   ``She's still gurgling,'' he said. ``There's a busy street up
ahead. Ahh, man. I can't see where I am.'' But later, as rescuers
frantically tried to find them, Stuart said, ``Oh, man, it hurts
and my wife has stopped gurgling, she's stopped breathing.''
   Police were able to finally locate the couple from the sound of
police sirens coming through the open cellular telephone after
Stuart blacked out.
   Mrs. Stuart died after the couple's son was delivered by
Caesarean section. Her husband and son survived. Stuart was listed
in stable condition Saturday at Boston City Hospital; Brigham and
Women's Hospital would not disclose the baby's condition.
   Police have no suspect in the shooting, officials said.
   ``With this case, there's kind of an awakening that says, `Oh
dear, it's real,'' said Scondras.
   It is especially real in the inner city. In Boston as a whole,
the homicide rate is actually down for the year. But in the
Roxbury, Mattapan and Dorchester sections of the city, crime is up.
There have been close to 200 shootings in two months there, up 33
percent. The shootings are a byproduct of an increase in gang
activity, police say.
   The Stuart killing brought the spotlight back to an area that
last made major headlines when a child, Tiffany Moore, was killed
last year by an errant shot from a gang member while she was
sitting on a mailbox outside her mother's home.
   Georgette Watson, a Roxbury community activist who started the
Drop-a-Dime program to get people to report crimes, said, ``Boston
as a whole is OK. The bulk of the crime is just here.''
   Youngsters in those areas are especially fearful.
   Jennifer Everette, an eighth-grader from Dorchester, wrote in a
recent writing exercise after the Stuart shooting: ``Dear God... I
wish my neighborhood was a beautiful place where I could walk the
street without being scared of being caught in a crossfire.''
   Black activists say it took the killing of a white suburbanite
to draw some attention to the situation.
   ``I was surprised that it made the national news,'' said Wornie
Reed, director of the William Monroe Trotter Institute, a think
tank at the University of Massachusetts in Boston where black
scholars examine black issues. ``I think if that had been a black
woman who lived in the area, it wouldn't have brought that much
attention.''
   Statistics show the number of shootings and murders overall in
Boston has remained almost the same this year. From January through
Sept. 30, there were 782 shootings; last year during the same
period there were 781. Homicides totaled 82 so far this year,
compared with 84 murders by this time last year.
   In all of 1988, Boston had 95 homicides out of a population of
620,000, which put it at 19th among major cities in the rate of
homicide. By comparison, St. Louis, with a population of 425,000,
had 140 homicides, according to FBI statistics. Newark, N.J., with
a population of 319,000, had 115 homicides.
   But police say more attention is being paid to crimes this year.
``Last year, the media didn't care about every shooting. Now they
do,'' said Boston police spokeswoman Jill Reilly.
   Nonetheless, some crimes get more attention than others.
   James Moody, a 29-year-old black man shot to death in Boston
just three hours after Carol Stuart, made the news only to
illustrate the relative anonymity of ``routine'' deaths among
minorities here.
   Watson said that she and other Roxbury leaders conducted a
survey to find out if people knew about both the Moody and Stuart
murders. Almost everyone had detailed knowledge of the Stuart case
but few knew anything about Moody, who was coming home from work at
the time he was fatally shot in the head.

<HEAD>Former Maryland Judge Walks Away from Federal Prison</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAGERSTOWN, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former judge who was uncovered as a
crooked lawyer after he disappeared from home and lived for months
under an assumed name was once again a fugitive Saturday, this time
from prison.
   The minimum-security federal prison camp at Eglin Air Force Base
in Florida declared Paul W. Ottinger, 74, an escapee late Friday,
said John Oury, associate warden.
   Ottinger had just completed the federal prison time he was
required to serve out of a 5{-year sentence he received Oct. 21,
1987 in U.S. District Court in Baltimore on charges of bank and
mail fraud.
   But he failed to report as scheduled to be turned over to
Maryland authorities so he could be taken to serve the rest of a
concurrent 8{-year state sentence.
   Prisoners at the unfenced Eglin prison camp near Fort Walton
Beach, Fla., on the Gulf of Mexico live in unlocked dormitories.
   Ottinger, who was a county circuit judge in Hagerstown from 1971
to 1977, was last seen at the prison camp at 6 a.m., wearing gray
sweat clothes and tennis shoes, Oury said. He was still missing as
of Saturday morning, officials said.
   Ottinger confessed in federal and state courts to bilking
several clients of his law practice out of hundreds of thousands of
dollars of insurance settlements and funds from estates.
   Ottinger was depicted in court as a heavy drinker and compulsive
gambler. A psychological study indicated Ottinger's problems
stemmed from a compulsive nature he acquired to help him rise above
his poor, rural Tennessee background.
   The fraud case surfaced in January 1987 when he mysteriously
disappeared from his Hagerstown home.
   FBI agents arrested Ottinger three months later near York, Pa.,
where he was living under the name of H. Edwin Robinson, who died
in 1921 at the age of 7. Ottinger had dyed his hair to disguise his
identity and was trying to pass himself off as a retired Ohio
schoolteacher.
   In January 1988, Ottinger pleaded guilty to three counts of
forgery in Somerset County Circuit Court. Judge Lloyd L. Simpkins
ordered him to pay $320,000 in restitution to legal clients he
defrauded.
   Larry Nathans, an assistant federal public defender, said Friday
he had been doing some legal work on Ottinger's behalf and talked
with him regularly.
   ``I hope he's OK,'' Nathans said, adding he did not know
anything about the escape. Asked by The (Baltimore) Sun if Ottinger
had ever talked about not wanting to serve his state sentence,
Nathans replied: ``I can't imagine he was looking forward to coming
back. Who wants to go into a state prison?''

   The likelihood that dozens of baby boa
constrictors are squirming in the rafters of an
earthquake-devastated pet shop is only one of the problems facing
residents trying to rebuild shops, houses and lives.
   The East Bay Vivarium's trail to recovery is typical of the
quake-damaged areas, full of heartbreak, shattered dreams and a
sometimes debilitating sense of despair, tempered only by the
sobering knowledge that life goes on.
   From dream homes in the idyllic Santa Cruz hills to flophouses
in Oakland, people are struggling to return their lives to a
semblance of the normality that existed before the 7.1-magnitude
quake struck Oct. 17, killing 66 people and causing $7 billion in
damage.
   ``This is just overwhelming _ the scale of the loss, in terms of
our building, of time shut down, the loss of customers,'' said Owen
Maercks, one of four owners of the 20-year-old vivarium billed as
the nation's largest reptile shop. ``It's like we're down to zero;
like we've got nothing more to lose.''
   ``We might have to eat rice for six months, but what else can we
do? Walk away?'' he asked, shaking his head.
   A few feet from his desk is a framed crayon drawing Maercks drew
at age 5, showing reptiles and dinosaurs in cages and captioned:
``I wish I had this.'' He's on the verge of losing it.
   Employees are keeping eyes upward and casting furtive glances
around as they move 10,000 animals to a new location.
   Eight hundred animals, including full-grown boas and pythons,
escaped when the force of the quake broke their enclosures. Most
were quickly recaptured, but about 100 remain unaccounted-for, and
baby snakes still roam the shop's giant warehouse just yards from
the collapsed section of the Nimitz Freeway.
   Elsewhere, San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos, worried about an
economic disaster from a precipitous drop in the lucrative
convention and tourist trade, says the city is ``98 percent
recovered.''
   But officials from disaster assistance agencies caution it will
be years before the cracked foundations of life have been fully
repaired. Moderate aftershocks still shaking the region threaten
further damage.
   ``You can't define when recovery is over; it just goes on, and
on,'' said Carl Koon, planning coordinator for the San Francisco
Office of Emergency Services. `You're looking at years. There is
not a magic date when the last nail goes in the last board or
anything of that nature.''
   ``To be honest, some individuals will never recover financially,
some never will recover mentally; many small businesses are going
to go bankrupt,'' Koon said.
   His opinion is echoed by officials throughout the affected
100-mile stretch of coastal California.
   ``Seeing an end, giving a date when we'll be back to normal
seems impossible; the sky seems to be the limit on our problems,''
said Marty Boyer, public information officer for Alameda County,
which suffered at least $2 billion in damage.
   Lisa Mackenroth, 42, was forced to move from one of 12 damaged
downtown residential hotels. With no family and few friends in the
area, she has been living in an emergency shelter and has no idea
when she'll find a home.
   ``Finding someplace to live that I can afford looks to me about
as easy now as winning the state lottery _ the odds are something
like 12 million to one that I'll succeed,'' said Mackenroth, who
lives on a Social Security disability income of about $600 a month.
   Judging from experience in the Southern California town of
Whittier, where a quake caused $350 million in damage to 5,000
homes and businesses almost exactly two years earlier, rebuilding
will take three to five years.
   ``It takes a longer time than anybody thinks,'' Bill Lewis,
Whittier's building rehabilitation manager, said in a telephone
interview. ``There are no quick fixes. Everybody on all sides has
to have a lot of patience.''
   The city of Whittier is still making quake repairs, ranging from
water mains to sewer systems, he added.
   Repairs to the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, where a section
collapsed Oct. 17, should allow it to reopen no later than the end
of November. The collapsed section of the Nimitz Freeway,
Interstate 880, is expected to be torn down by mid-December and
temporarily replaced with a ground-level expressway.
   Many people who saw their dreams reduced to rubble are dealing
with the anguish by working nonstop to restore it. Others have
walked away.
   Patty Valdenaire, 32, had worked in her mother's 25-year-old
clothing store in downtown Los Gatos since she was 7.
   The store, Idamina's, relocated last week from the devastated
downtown to a shopping mall on the outskirts of the city.
Valdenaire, who estimates she lost 30 percent of her annual $1
million sales, hopes to reopen Monday. The new shop is a third
smaller.
   ``I grew up in this store, but it's hard to feel sad, even
though our old building is just crumbling away,'' Valdenaire said.
``I feel it's something we want to put behind us.''

   When youths exposed to a lifestyle of inner-city
crime chronicle their feelings, they say things like, ``I never
know, when I step out of my house, what is going to happen.''
   ``Every night I hear gunshots around my way. I'm surrounded by
gangs,'' said Johanna Graves, a high school senior. ``I go out if I
need something, but not just to hang out,'' said Jerome White, 15.
   These are the kids living the everyday life of innocents in the
city's hub of violence.
   Their stories came pouring out when teachers at the Mission
Church High School in Boston's Roxbury section encouraged students
to write and talk about their fears of increasing violence in the
inner city.
   After the recent killing of a pregnant suburban woman in their
neighborhood stirred national headlines, more than 70 students
wrote prayers and letters to senators and local newspaper editors
appealing for an end to the violence.
   ``Dear Senator ... I live in Roxbury and there is violence
everyday with guns,'' wrote Silletta Davis, an 11th-grader. ``I
don't feel safe anymore, because I never know, when I step out of
my house, what is going to happen.''
   The 240 students at the school, consisting of grades seven
through 12, were read Davis' letter last Wednesday at an assembly
to give them a chance to talk about what their neighborhoods have
become, said Andre Ravenelle, assistant principal at the parochial
school.
   ``I just found out yesterday that someone deals drugs on my
corner,'' said Robert Alexander, a 17-year-old senior from
Dorchester. ``I saw it. Some woman drove up and she gave this guy
some money, he gave her something. And the sad thing is, there were
three kids in the car,'' said Alexander, who calls his community
``Drugchester.''
   The idea to get students to express themselves about crime came
from the Violence Prevention Project based at Boston City Hospital,
said Sister Patrice Garrity, the school's principal. The project
was incorporated into a Christian Lifestyle curriculum, which helps
students learn to handle anger when relating to one another, she
said.
   Most students live in Mattapan, Dorchester, Jamaica Plain and
Roxbury, sections in which nearly 200 shootings have been reported
since Sept. 1.
   But some of the students said they believe the good side of the
neighborhoods and its people is never mentioned and the violence
has led every black youth to be considered a criminal.
   ``The police see you as a bad guy because you live in Orchard
Park,'' a housing project in Roxbury, said James Hendrick, a senior
who wants to become a police officer. ``The police harass me
everyday. They're supposed to serve and protect, but instead they
stop and harass. It doesn't pay to be a positive black male.''
   Hendrick, 18, who wrote to his senator asking for tougher gun
control laws, said positive youths like his classmates should get
more attention to counter the violence.

   Iran marked the 10th anniversary of the
seizure of the U.S. Embassy on Saturday by opening the compound to
the public and displaying seven alleged CIA spies. Most Iranians
ignored the event.
   The apparent disinterest was a blow to radicals who hoped to use
the occasion to stir up anti-American passion. It was a victory for
President Hashemi Rafsanjani, who wants to improve Iran's relations
with the West and end his country's isolation.
   About 10,000 to 15,000 people gathered outside the one-time U.S.
Embassy in Tehran, which was stormed by militant ``students'' Nov.
4, 1979. For 444 days, 52 American diplomats and embassy personnel
were held hostage there.
   Even routine Friday prayer gatherings attract more people than
the rally. Crowds at previous anti-U.S. rallies have been estimated
at more than 1 million.
   The main speaker was former Interior Minister Ali Akbar
Mohtashemi, Rafsanjani's main rival. It was his first public
appearance since he was dropped by Rafsanjani when he formed his
new Cabinet in August.
   Mohtashemi repeatedly referred to the animosity the late founder
of the Islamic republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, harbored
toward the United States. Khomeini died on June 3.
   ``Ten years ago today, when the students following the Imam's
(Khomeini's) line seized the den of spies, the whole world marveled
that the face of America was pushed in the mud,'' Mohtashemi said.
   He noted that Khomeini was against any rapprochement with the
``bloodsucker government of the United States.''
   The crowd often interrupted to shout ``Death to America!'' and
``Death to Israel!''
   They waved life-size portraits of Khomeini and his successor as
supreme leader of the Islamic republic, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
   During a march to the embassy from Tehran University, a mile
away, some students burned an effigy of Uncle Sam and about 160
U.S. flags, some with skulls in place of stars.
   Banners vowing to ``fight the U.S. until the last drop of our
blood,'' hung from maple trees surrounding the compound, which now
is used as a training base for young Revolutionary Guards.
   The fashionable Talegani Avenue in front of the embassy was
festooned with slogans, saying: ``No relations with the United
States'' and ``America is the top enemy of the world's oppressed
and deprived people.''
   The government apparently had been trying to keep anniversary
ceremonies as low key as possible.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency reported that
Rafsanjani met officials involved in rebuilding the southern city
of Khorramshahr, damaged in the eight-year war with Iraq, and told
them Iranians' ``energy must be used for reconstruction ... among
the most effective ways of combatting arrogance,'' an Iranian
euphemisim for the United States.
   The embassy takeover led to the cutting of U.S.-Iranian ties and
the freezing of billions of dollars in Iranian assets in the United
States.
   The hostages were finally released Jan. 20, 1981, the day Jimmy
Carter left office and Ronald Reagan was sworn in as president. The
crisis was resolved when the United States pledged not to interfere
in Iran's internal affairs and the countries established a
framework for settling billions of dollars in claims against each
other.
   Iran has since demanded the unfreezing of its assets in return
for its help in freeing 18 Westerners, including eight Americans,
held hostage mostly by pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon.
   The seven alleged CIA spies appeared at a news conference in a
corrugated iron hut next to the main embassy building.
   They said they were recruited by the Central Intelligence Agency
while abroad.
   One of the alleged agents, Bahman Aqaei, said he was recruited
while working at the Iranian embassy in New Delhi, India.
   Aqaei, the group's spokesman, said they had been trained in
espionage techniques and promised as much as $1,200 a month, a
small fortune in economically troubled Iran, but never received any
money.
   He claimed he was recruited by an American Embassy official who
put him in contact with a dissident Iranian group, which he did not
identify. Others said they were recruited in West Germany and
Turkey.
   Bearded young men cradling AK-47 automatic rifles in their arms
steered the media into the compound.
   Young Revolutionary Guards could be seen through the windows of
the main building attending classes. Others played volleyball in a
field in the center of the compound.
   It was the first time the complex had been opened to the public.
   Among several displays was a grisly reproduction of the shooting
down of an Iran Air passenger jet by the U.S. missile cruiser
Vincennes on July 3, 1988. All 290 people aboard died.
   U.S. officials say the cruiser, which was in action against
Iranian gunboats in the Persian Gulf, mistook the airliner for an
attacking jet fighter.
   Photographs of crash victims were scattered among a pile of
debris of broken aircraft parts. Wax figures in bloody clothes,
representing the victims, were spread around. Some were missing
heads or limbs.

   The novelty of a mayoral campaign between two
black candidates is being overshadowed by something more familiar
to Cleveland voters: rough, tough, hardball politics.
   City Council President George Forbes and state Sen. Michael
White have pulled no punches in a campaign filled with allegations
of wife beating, strong-arm tactics and name calling. Former Mayor
Dennis Kucinich says that's what Clevelanders expect.
   ``Cleveland politics is not high tea,'' said Kucinich, who
narrowly survived a recall attempt during his own tumultuous term
as mayor in the 1970s. ``It's a rock 'em, sock 'em, knock-'em-out
type of politics in the finest tradition of America. And if it was
anything different, people here would be bored and wouldn't vote.''
   Forbes, president of City Council since 1973, wants voters to
recognize his role in the city's recovery from its December 1978
default on $14 million in loans to six banks. The default, the
first by a major American city since the Great Depression, wreaked
havoc on the city's credit rating and its image.
   White, a city councilman at the time of the default and a state
senator since 1984, has said he can unify the city, which has
almost equal numbers of black and white residents.
   Those messages, however, have been clouded at times by
allegations that White is a slumlord who beat his two previous
wives and that Forbes is an old-style city boss who has used public
office for personal gain.
   The two Democrats emerged from a field of five candidates, the
other three of them white, in an Oct. 3 non-partisan primary.
Forbes placed first, with 37 percent of the vote; White was second
with 25 percent.
   Since then, a poll by Cleveland's major newspaper, The Plain
Dealer, showed White leading Forbes by 46 percent to 27 percent.
The poll of 802 registered voters was conducted Oct. 16-19 and had
a margin of sampling error of 3.5 percentage points.
   The winner of Tuesday's general election will become Cleveland's
first black mayor since Carl Stokes, now a municipal judge, won the
office and served as the first black mayor of a large American city
from 1967-71.
   Mayor George Voinovich, a popular, low-key Republican, is
leaving office after three terms to seek the GOP nomination for
governor.
   Forbes, a 59-year-old lawyer, is keenly aware of the
significance of two black candidates seeking the city's top job.
   ``This city has moved forward by leaps and bounds,'' he said in
a recent televised debate. ``No one could have even imagined that
two black men could be running for mayor in a city that is almost
divided equally between black and white.''
   White, 38, holder of a master's degree in public administration,
has played down the racial significance. He has stressed his
commitment to unifying the city's primarily black east side and
white west side, and has depicted the election as a battle between
two competing philosophies:
   ``One philosophy has sought to lead by divide and conquer, by
pitting east against west and black against white. The other
philosophy is that it is time for us to come together as a city.''
   Forbes stresses his close ties with Voinovich over the past 10
years. But voters also remember less flattering highlights of that
decade: Forbes cursing at a reporter who questioned him about a
delinquent water bill, or throwing a chair at a city councilman.
   ``I have said there have been things I have done that I wish I
had not done. There have been some things I have said that I wish I
had not said. I apologize about that,'' he said.
   Forbes also has refused to make his income tax filings public
despite reports linking his law firm to business deals with the
city while he was City Council president. He has denied using his
position for private gain.
   White, who has been married three times, has had to answer
accusations that he beat his first two wives. One report was based
on court documents and the other on remarks by his second wife.
   ``Divorce is not a very pretty thing,'' White said. ``There have
been, quite frankly, times where there have been heated exchanges.
I am neither an abuser nor a beater of women. ... I never beat my
ex-wives.''
   Forbes has called White a slumlord, alleging that city housing
inspection records show that White owns seven properties that
together have some 200 code violations. White has said inspections
of the properties during the mayoral campaign were politically
motivated.

<HEAD>Constitutional Panel May Rule on Scarf Controversy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The education minister said Saturday he will ask a
constitutional panel to decide whether Moslem schoolgirls can wear
their traditional head coverings to class.
   A nationwide debate has raged since three girls at a school in
Creil, 40 miles north of Paris, decided in October to wear the
traditional ``hijab'' that covers hair, ears and neck. The
principal did not allow them to attend class.
   Critics of the headdresses say they violate the traditional
separation of church and state.
   Education Minister Lionel Jospin said he would ask France's
Council of State on Monday to rule on the issue. Its opinion would
be advisory, and Jospin said it would form the basis for a
wide-ranging national discussion of the issue.
   In a statement, Jospin recalled that he had announced his
position Oct. 26 in the National Assembly: that school authorities
should try to discuss the issue with parents and students to try to
persuade them to ``respect the secularity of the school'' by taking
the headscarves off.
   But he said that if persuasion failed, the girls must be allowed
to stay in class even with the scarves.
   The Council of State makes final rulings on constitutional
issues in France, but also oversees the operations of government
agencies and can be asked for advice on any topic the government
chooses.
   The issue of wearing religious symbols in school has been
emotionally charged since the 19th century, when advocates of a
secular school system free from influence of the dominant Roman
Catholic Church won a bitter fight.
   Islam is now the second-largest religion in France, with more
than 3 million Moslems in a population of 55 million.
   As the dispute swelled in recent weeks, President Francois
Mitterrand's wife, Danielle, came out in favor of allowing the
students to wear scarves.
   A poll by the Ipsos public opinion firm made public Saturday by
the newsmagazine Le Point found only 26 percent of those questioned
agreed with Mrs. Mitterrand and 63 percent were opposed. The rest
had no opinion or declined to answer.
   In Nice, about 1,500 people attended a march called Saturday by
the extreme-right National Front to protest what it calls the
``Islamization'' of France, shouting such slogans as ``Out with the
Chador'' and ``Scarves in the Closet.''

   A private charter plane of
presidential candidate Fernando Collor de Mello crashed into a hill
Saturday and exploded in southeastern Brazil, killing all five
aboard, officials said.
   Collor de Mello was in Brasilia taping television advertisements
when the accident occurred.
   The twin-engined Lear jet crashed shortly after midnight Friday
in the remote region of Ribeirao das Neves, 270 miles northwest of
Rio, Air Force Lt. Osimar Lures Neves said.
   The aircraft was making the 40-minute flight from Rio to the
southeastern city of Belo Horizonte, 290 miles northwest of Rio,
when it developed engine trouble, Neves said by phone from Belo
Horizonte.
   The pilot attempted an emergency landing but the craft flew into
a mountain ridge and exploded, Neves said.
   The pilot, co-pilot, two Brazilian journalists and one
unidentified person died instantly, he said.
   Officials were investigating the cause of the crash, Neves said.

   All pregnant students have
been expelled from the College of Education in the black homeland
of Venda, the independent South Africa Press Association reported
Saturday.
   Venda's director general for education, S.R. Makhuvha, said the
pregnant women would not be allowed to take final examinations but
could apply for admission again after giving birth, the news agency
said.
   The agency's report gave no reason for Makhuvha's ruling nor did

   Located in the far northeast corner of South Africa, Venda is
one of four black homelands declared independent by the Pretoria

   President Wojciech Jaruzelski's daughter
says she posed for magazine photos in a nightgown and on a bearskin
rug in an attempt to humanize her father's image, but now the
experience has left her bitter.
   Even as reform and a new openness sweep Poland, the pictures in
Paris Match of Monika Jaruzelska _ as the feminine form of the
surname is spelled _ and a text suggesting she would rather live in
Italy have left her on the defensive.
   ``She's 26 years old, she rides a horse, frequents hip clubs,
dreams of living in Italy ...'' starts the four-page article in the
Oct. 26 edition of the news and picture weekly magazine under the
headline ``Miss Poland? No: Mademoiselle Jaruzelska.''
   There are six photographs, the main one a double-page spread
showing her in a nightgown reading in bed with a tray holding a
coffee cup and a pitcher.
   In others she is smoking a cigar, sitting on a bearskin rug in
front of a fireplace, wearing a dark wig and a sheer polka-dot
blouse, and putting on lipstick while wearing a fur and sitting at
the wheel of a four-wheel-drive vehicle.
   ``Like other young people, Monika would like to have a 4x4 like
the one she's posing in here,'' the text reads. ``This happy young
woman loves to change personality and look: `I have a few wigs. I
wore the black one in a video made in the West.'''
   ``It's her way to live pluralism a la Polonaise,'' the article
concludes.
   But back in Poland, Ms. Jaruzelska told a Warsaw newspaper that
her venture into the free-wheeling Western media has turned into
``a new and bitter experience in life.''
   The recent Warsaw University graduate now working on a film for
a Swiss director said she had hoped the pictures would contribute
to a new image of her father.
   ``I always considered as unjust and harmful the attacks of the
Western press on the allegedly `gloomy man in dark glasses,''' she
told the Zycie Warszawy newspaper.
   Little has been known about the private life of Jaruzelski, the
ram-rod straight military officer who imposed martial law in 1981
to crack down on the Solidarity movement.
   But in a year of historic political and economic change,
including the East bloc's first non-communist government, a
television special showed Jaruzelski at home, and other bits of his
personal views have reached print.
   When a photographer approached her through a friend in
September, Ms. Jaruzelska said she agreed to pose for two reasons:
   ``First I wanted to contribute to shaping a new image of my
father ... adding to the whole story a certain `human' accent.
Secondly, I assumed that artistic photography is in the sphere of
my interests and film plans,'' she told Zycie Warszawy.
   She said she accepted no money for the photos and denied reports
that she plans to marry the photographer.
   ``Among the photographs he took, there is none that would abuse
my dignity or decencies,'' she told the newspaper. ``But obviously,
the way of cutting the frame and mainly the spiteful commentary can
change the meaning of the photographs.''
   She denies saying she would rather live in Italy, a touchy
subject for the daughter of the president of a country where
economic crisis has driven many talented young people to emigrate.
   ``I said something completely different. I spoke about my deep
ties with Polish culture. ... However, I said that I have been
interested for a long time in Italian culture ... especially in the
great films of this country.''
   Paris Match describes Ms. Jaruzelska as asserting her
independence and quotes her saying, ``Everyone has a right to
choose where to live, work, feel good about himself.'''
   ``But she emphasizes that her roots are in Poland,'' the
magazine says.
   And it reports that she lunches daily, with her dog Mounchia, at
her parents' house ``where she finds the general-president, the man
in dark glasses, without mystery for her: `Both of us, we love
literature, good food and cycling.' It's the only state secret she
is willing to give.''

<HEAD>Sixth Colombian Drug Suspect Turned Over To U.S.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Colombian businessman under cocaine
indictments in Florida, California and Illinois was handed over to
U.S. authorities in Bogota and flown here Saturday, authorities
said.
   Guillermo Juan Bueno Delgado, 54, a hotel owner and investor in
Colombia, was arrested there Sept. 14, and the U.S. Justice
Department asked for his extradition to face long-standing charges,
beginning with a Florida indictment.
   ``The indictment alleges that Bueno was part of a significant
drug trafficking conspiracy,'' said U.S. Marshal W.L. McLendon of
Florida's Northern District. ``It is an important development in
the fight against drugs that he has now been returned to the United
States to finally go on trial.''
   Bueno is the sixth Colombian turned over to U.S. authorities and
extradited since August, when President Virgilio Barco announced a
stepped-up war on drugs and a loosening of a ban on extradition
after the assassination of a leading presidential candidate.
   Murders and other violence against anti-drug activists in
Colombia have been stepped up in reaction.
   Bueno was being held under tight security in the Tallahassee
area pending a court appearance, John J. Twomey, acting director of
the U.S. Marshals Service, said in Washington.
   Members of the marshals' special operations group assisted by
Drug Enforcement Administration agents took Bueno into custody
Saturday moring and flew him to Tallahassee aboard a jet that
landed here at 10 a.m.
   The U.S. charges against Bueno are:
   _ a February 1983 indictment by a federal grand jury in San
Francisco on charges of importing cocaine, conspiring to import
cocaine; and with distribution of the drug.
   _ a September 1985 indictment against Bueno, under the alias of
Willie Bueno, by a federal grand jury in the Southern District of
Illinois on charges of conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to
distribute and with conspiracy to distribute.
   _ an October 1985 indictment issued in Gainesville charging him
with conspiring with 17 other people from 1980 to 1985 to import
cocaine into the United States. He is to face these Florida chages
first.
   Authorities said Bueno, who once lived for a time in Miami and
Key Biscayne, Fla., resides in both Cali and San Andres Island,
Colombia.

<HEAD>State Department Criticizes Dissolution of Lebanese Parliament</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department accused the Christian
leader of Lebanon on Saturday of undermining the constitutional
structure of the Middle Eastern country by dissolving parliament.
   ``He does a disservice to the state and the people he claims to
defend,'' spokeswoman Nancy Beck said in a statement that sharply
criticized Gen. Michel Aoun, the Christian army commander who took
the action in the absence of a Lebanese president.
   The parliament was to meet to ratify an agreement negotiated by
the legislators last month in Taif, Saudi Arabia, under Arab League
auspices. It would strengthen the role of Moslems in the Lebanese
government without providing a timetable for the withdrawal of
Syrian forces from their occupation of much of Lebanon.
   The State Department backs the agreement as a ``unique
opportunity'' to end fighting between Christian and Moslem
factions. But Joseph A. Boohaker, spokesman for the National
Alliance of Lebanese Americans, said Friday ``you are going to have
a mirror image of Syria'' in Lebanon.
   Boohaker, a Birmingham, Ala., lawyer, said the accord calls for
negotiations with Syria beginning in 1991 for a withdrawal only
from the Beirut area; that it does not provide a timetable for a
pullout from the Bekaa Valley,
   ``There has to be a link between reforms and withdrawal,''
Boohaker said.
   The State Department on Friday reiterated its general call for a
withdrawal of all forces from Lebanon and said it had asked Syria
to ``take action'' against terrorist groups based there and in
Syria.
   The accord was endorsed by 59 of the 63 lawmakers who attended a
special parliamentary session called by the Arab League in Taif.
Apart from Aoun's objections, the leader of Amal, Nabih Berri,
opposed the Taif agreement because he felt it did not sufficiently
increase his group's representation.
   State Department spokeswoman Beck on Saturday said Aoun's
dissolution of the parliament ``was an obvious attempt to block
implementation of the Taif agreement and to subvert the efforts of
the Arab League to promote a lasting peace in Lebanon. It
jeopardizes Lebanon's chances of ending 14 years of war and we
deplore it.''
   She added: ``Gen. Aoun's action undermines one of Lebanon's last
remaining institutions with constitutional legitimacy. He does a
disservice to the state and people he claims to defend.''
   The U.S. official said the parliament has the right to meet in
Lebanon to continue ``the process of national reconciliation.''

   Thousands of East Germans
poured into this border town Saturday after Czechoslovakia opened
the floodgates for refugees who have abandoned hope of a better
life in their Communist homeland.
   The break came late Friday when it was announced that East
German officials had agreed to let allied Czechoslovakia open its
western frontier to people pouring in from East Germany.
   ``The people back there have just given up hope,'' Olaf
Acksteiner, a 27-year-old from Cottbus, told reporters after
arriving on the first train carrying refugees from Prague, the
Czechoslovak capital.
   The mostly young skilled workers continue to leave their country
despite the removal of hard-line leader Erich Honecker on Oct. 18
and indications that his replacement, Egon Krenz, is open to
reforms.
   On Friday, Krenz announced a sweeping program of reform and the
resignation of five old guard Politburo members.
   Still, as many as 1 million East Germans converged on the
capital, East Berlin, on Saturday to demand more freedom. Many
carried signs deriding Krenz and the Communist Party, voicing
distrust and despair.
   Neither Czechoslovak nor East German officials have indicated
how long the escape route will remain open.
   The refugees arriving here speculated that tens of thousands or
more would take advantage of the unprecedented opening to a new
life.
   One new arrival, Michael Wilke, 27, said he guessed that 2
million of his countrymen would leave through Czechoslovakia by the
end of the year.
   ``The Communist Party is just going to hold onto power,'' Wilke
said. ``After 40 years of power, it's not just going to give up
right now.''
   Joachim Doerig, a West German border police official, said he
expected about 8,000 East German refugees to reach West Germany
over the weekend.
   About 70,000 other East Germans have fled West through Hungary,
Poland and Czechoslovakia since August, when the reform-minded
Hungarian government began dismantling its border barriers with the
West.
   Together with a record level of legal emigration from East
Germany, as many as 190,000 East Germans are expected to arrive in
West Germany this year, West Germany's Inter-German Affairs
Minister, Dorothee Wilms, predicted Friday in Berlin. The East
Germans are given automatic citizenship in West German.
   Ms. Wilms' estimate was given before the Czechoslovak border was
open.
   The latest exodus out of East Germany began Wednesday when Krenz
lifted travel restrictions that had prevented citizens from
traveling freely to Czechoslovakia. Honecker had imposed the
restrictions in October to stop an earlier exodus.
   East Germans immediately headed for the West German Embassy in
Prague. Until Friday night, they had to go through a lengthy
process before getting permission to go West. It included being
ferried to the East German Embassy to renounce their citizenship,
then going back to the Western embassy to await permission to leave.
   East Germany was processing only about 100 people a day, and by
late Friday abut 5,000 people were crushed into the West German
Embassy compound.
   Cheers erupted when word came that the procedure had been
changed and they could leave Czechoslovakia simply by showing their
East German identity documents.
   Refugees continued to arrive at the West German Embassy on
Saturday, many skeptical or unaware of the new freedom to travel
West.
   ``I can't believe it,'' said one long-haired teen-ager, after an
embassy employee told him. He then asked several West German
journalists: ``Is it true, is it really true?''
   A large group of East Germans hung their apartment keys on a
rope and dangled it from an embassy window before leaving.
   ``There are still empty apartments in East Germany,'' yelled one
of them, alluding to the shortage of homes in his country.
   Five special trains began evacuating the refugees from
Czechoslovakia early Saturday, and thousands of others were
believed to be headed from East Germany to the Czechoslovak-West
German border in private cars.
   The first trainload from Prague arrived at 3:15 p.m. in a cold
drizzle.
   About 400 people met the refugees with two dozen baby carriages,
hot tea, blankets and food.
   ``A hearty welcome to you,'' the train station loudspeaker
boomed to the new arrivals. ``The federal border police and the
mayor of Marktredwitz welcome you to the Federal Republic of
Germany.''
   One man in the welcoming party hoisted a placard bearing a job
offer: ``I'm looking for a butcher's apprentice.''
   Manuela Loeffelholz, a 19-year-old from Erfurt, told reporters
she broke off her nursing studies to flee to the West with her
fiance, Rene Ulehm, 21, also from Erfurt.
   ``My parents drove us to Prague and left us outside the
embassy,'' Ms. Loeffelholz said. ``Then we just had to say goodbye.
I hope they can come out later.''
   Martina Bauer, who arrived with her husband, Detlef, and two
young sons, had tears in her eyes. ``We're just thrilled that it
finally worked,'' her husband said.
   Hundreds of other East German refugees streamed across the
border in planes, trains and automobiles.
   An East Berlin woman told reporters in Czechoslovakia that she
and her husband were simply waved through the East
German-Czechoslovak border.
   ``We were never before treated so nicely at the border,'' the
woman said. ``We were waved through with a friendly `Auf
Wiedersehen.'''
   A spokesman for the West German Railroad system, Luther
Chostiani, said special trains from Prague would be arriving in
West Germany hourly until demand in the Czechoslovak capital
subsided.
   In a speech televised nationally over East Germany's state-run
network, Krenz on Friday night appealed to his people to stay and
rebuild East Germany.
   ``Trust our policy of renewal,'' Krenz said. ``Your place, dear
fellow citizens, is here. We need you.''

   Four Americans, including three soldiers
from the U.S. Army base here, were charged Saturday in the beating
death of a man outside a nightclub, U.S. officials said.
   The U.S. statement said the names of the Americans and the
charges they face would not be released until an investigation was
completed.
   Italian investigators said Johnny Boateng, 32, a citizen of
Ghana, was struck in the head with a piece of wood during an
argument with the Americans early Friday outside the Palladium
disco near Vicenza.
   ``Information provided by U.S. investigators led to the
apprehension and subsequent charging of suspects,'' the public

exercised the right of jurisdiction over the incident.''
   The statement said the three servicemen were attached to the
Caserma Ederle base. Italian police and media reports said the
fourth American was a player or coach of a local football team.

   The Social Democratic Party, one of
many parties challenging the ruling Socialists in national
elections next year, split into two factions Saturday because of
policy disagreements.
   The Social Democratic Party is one of nearly two dozen new or
reformed parties preparing for the contested elections, which will
be the first since the Communists consolidated power in 1948.
   Leaders of the new faction, calling itself the Independent
Social Democratic Party, accused their rivals of bourgeois
tendencies. The accusations came on the second day of a congress
called to plan election strategies.
   Spokeswoman Anna Petrasovits of the mainstream faction
criticized the breakaway group, saying it seeks alliances with
``the East European left.''
   ``We represent the (West) European left,'' she told Hungarian
television.
   One of the issues that split the Social Democratic Party was
whether or not to cooperate with the Socialist Party, which
replaced the Communist Party when it was disbanded last month.
   The Socialist Party professed democratic ideals but is still
headed by leaders of the defunct Communist Party.

   When he announced his family's plans to sell
Rockefeller Center, David Rockefeller said the deal ``preserves the
abiding commitment'' to New York City his father made 50 years ago,
``and which generations of the family continue to feel.''
   But the sale to one of Japan's largest real estate companies
underscored a change in the relationship between the Rockefellers
and New York, and offered a reminder that the city will have to
face the next century with relatively little assistance from a
family that helped it through this one.
   New York has had many rich and powerful families such as the
deLanceys, the Astors and the Vanderbilts, but none shaped the city
like the Rockefellers.
   The family's accumulated works range from the stone towers of
the Cloisters, a museum in the shape of a monastery in northern
Manhattan, to the gleaming steel ones of the World Trade Center
downtown.
   In between there is Lincoln Center, the Museum of Modern Art,
the Museum of the City of New York, Rockefeller University,
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, the Asia Society, Chase
Manhattan Plaza.
   ``Where else,'' asks historian Henry Hope Reed, ``can we find so
large a contribution by one family, and a contribution so diverse?''
   Not Japan, apparently. Last weekend, at a conference on
philanthropy at the Rockefeller estate in Pocantico Hills, Japanese
experts explained that the Japanese do not have the philanthropic
tradition that the Rockefellers epitomize; they traditionally look
to government for such services.
   Japan's Mitsubishi Estate Co. said Monday it would pay $846
million to buy a 51 percent stake in Rockefeller Group Inc.
Rockefeller Group's most famous asset is the 22-acre Rockefeller
Center in midtown Manhattan, with its skating rink, annual
Christmas tree, Radio City Music Hall and office buildings. The
Associated Press Building, the news service's world headquarters,
is located in the center.
   News of the purchase was accompanied by assurances the center
will be maintained with the attention for which the Rockefellers
are renowned.
   But New York knows what a difference an individual can make in
the life of a city, because of the examples of John D. Rockefeller
Jr., the man who built Rockefeller Center during the Depression.
   He began life as the son of the nation's richest man, who was
notorious for ruthlessly eliminating competition to monopolize the
U.S. oil-refining industry at the turn of the century.
   As Peter Collier and David Horowitz note in their book, ``The
Rockefellers,'' the son created a philanthropic empire as
impressive as the father's business one. For Junior, ``giving was a
profession, a vocation,'' in which he helped his father spend $500
million and then gave away another $500 million himself.
   Although his gifts were widespread _ he preserved thousands of
acres of Western wilderness and restored colonial Williamsburg, Va.
_ New York City was his focus.
   ``The city was his passion, making it a better place,'' said
Paul Gunther of the Municipal Art Society. ``The physical evidence
is everywhere. Those things would not have been built without him.''
   He built the Cloisters and the Riverside Church, a re-creation
of a French Gothic cathedral. He contributed $1 million to Union
Theological Seminary and built International House for foreign
students.
   In December 1946, hours before the United Nations was set to
establish its headquarters outside New York City, Rockefeller
agreed to pay $8.5 million for a site on the East River, which he
gave to the world body.
   ``Why, Pa, that's most generous!'' his son Nelson, later to
become governor of New York and then vice president, told him.
   Rockefeller's children followed his lead, playing dominant or
vital roles in the creation of Lincoln Center, the World Trade
Center and numerous other projects.
   Today, there still is a vast Rockefeller commitment to
philanthropy. But John D. Jr.'s two surviving sons are in their
70s, and three years ago Fortune magazine concluded that the family
``is retreating from a tradition of massive giving.''
   The family's fourth generation, the 22 men and women who call
themselves the Cousins, range in age from 22 to 61. By some
accounts they give away as much as $40 million a year. But the
original family of eight that lived under one roof has multiplied
and scattered across the nation, and their charitable concerns
have, too.
   Few of the cousins live in New York now, and the city is not a
primary focus of their philanthropy, said Gunther.
   The city also has changed. ``It was a lot easier to assemble
land and get things built in (John D. Jr.'s) days,'' said George
Taylor Jr., a family spokesman.

<HEAD>KGB Chief Acknowledges Organization's Stalinist Excesses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief of the KGB acknowledged Saturday that
the secret police played a role in the cruelty and repression of
the Stalin regime and vowed that such brutality would never happen
again.
   ``We bow our heads in memory of the innocent victims,'' Vladimir
A. Kryuchkov said on national television. ``This is a moral
purification for us all and a guarantee that it will never happen
again. Never.''
   Kryuchkov made the admission in a speech at a Kremlin gathering
in advance of Tuesday's anniversary celebrations marking the 1917
Bolshevik revolution.
   The speech was another step in the push by Kryuchkov, who became
KGB chief a year ago, to partially lift the tight veil of secrecy
over the feared secret police.
   Dictator Josef Stalin's cult of personality ``distorted the
institutions of Soviet power, and law enforcement bodies, including
state security organs, were turned into a weapon of Stalin's
arbitrary rule,'' Kryuchkov said.
   ``There is no justification for the mass repression and cruelty
often inflicted on behalf of the revolution, the party and the
people,'' the KGB chief said.
   The Stalin period of 1924-1953 now is widely criticized in the
Soviet Union for the murder and imprisonment of millions of
innocent citizens. The KGB has been among the last to acknowledge
its part in the terror, much less on nationwide television during a
celebration of the founding of the Soviet state.
   Since becoming head of the KGB on Oct. 1, 1988, Kryuchkov has
pushed cooperation with foreign secret services on international
terrorism and drug trafficking, granted interviews to Soviet and
foreign press and even allowed a government news agency to make a
movie about his organization. On Thursday, five KGB officers
answered questions on a nationwide TV call-in program.
   In a sign of his standing in the Kremlin, the KGB chief was made
a full member of the ruling Communist Party Politburo in September.
   Kryuchkov rejected arguments that the Stalinist terror was a
logical outcome of the revolution that brought the Bolsheviks to
power in 1917.
   Speaking before a rostrum that included President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and the rest of the Politburo and government leaders,
Kryuchkov sounded a conciliatory note as he discussed social and
economic problems piling up in the country.
   The KGB chief called for ``constructive dialogue'' to prevent
strikes from further hampering the economy. Officials have warned
that strikes last summer cut into the supply of coal set aside for
winter heating and generation of electricity.
   Despite a ban on many strikes passed by the Supreme Soviet
legislature last month, many coal miners in the Arctic area of
Vorkuta have walked off their jobs again in the past week.
   ``In many cases they are caused by difficult labor and social
conditions, and often demands of strikes are justified though may
not be immediately feasible,'' he said.
   The party also deserves criticism, he said.
   Some criticism goes ``beyond the limits of objectiveness, of
reason and even of decency,'' Kryuchkov said. ``However, we cannot
ignore the fact that many criticial remarks addressed to the party
are justified. The party will have to part with
administrative-command methods, to gradually correct mistakes, to
work out a new strategy and do its best to regain people's trust in
it.''
   But, echoing Gorbachev, the KGB chief stressed that Soviets must
learn to work harder. He told the nation that Americans are twice
as productive at work as Soviets and that ``we'll live better only
on condition that everyone starts to work better.''

   A plan to scare pigeons from the
Statehouse steps by using inflatable owls was strictly for the
birds.
   ``It was a total failure,'' said Administration Secretary Chuck
Polan. ``Maybe not a total failure, but it didn't work.''
   The pigeons are a nuisance at the Capitol because they eat grass
seed and splatter the porches with their droppings. Some parts of
the Capitol accumulate up to 1 inch of droppings every two days,
said Bob Plantz, director of general services for state government.
   ``It's getting worse than asbestos,'' Plantz zaid. ``I may see
if it can be declared a health hazard.''
   Plantz's office purchased about a half-dozen of the inflatable
owls, at $6.95 each, at a discount store in September, hoping they
would frighten away the flocks of pigeons that make the Capitol
complex their homes.
   Theoretically, pigeons would mistake the plastic owls for
predators and flee in terror. The owls apparently flustered some
pigeons but not enough to make a difference, Plantz said.
   The state will continue to look at other options to keep the
pigeons under control, Polan said. But he conceded he's running out
of ideas.

   The conventioneers were getting out of
hand _ telling loud jokes, honking horns, blowing whistles and
laughing nonstop.
   But that, to convention organizers, made it a very successful
day. The convention's theme? ``The Power of Laughter and Play.''
   It was part convention, part circus as 600 conventioneers
chuckled and guffawed their way through such weekend seminars as
``Humor and Healthcare'' and ``Discovering the Humor, Creativity
and Magic Within Us.''
   Some spouted statistics: laughing 100 times per day is
equivalent to 10 minutes of exercise on a rowing machine. And
audience members learned while they laughed, about such things as
how humor can benefit sick people and help organizations run more
smoothly.
   ``I'm not here to turn you into stand-up comedians,'' humor
specialist Joel Goodman told the group.
   Still, his speech was laced with one-liners _ the secret of
managing is to keep the five guys who hate you away from the four
who are undecided. And there are reports of vandals who stole all
the toilet seats in the local police station. Police have nothing
to go on.
   Goodman is director of the Humor Project, a Saratoga Springs,
N.Y., humor group that publishes Laughing Matters magazine.
   The weekend conference was the seventh such meeting organized by
the Institute for the Advancement of Human Behavior, a Stanford,
Calif.-based group that sponsors seminars on psychology and
self-help.

<HEAD>Semi-Annual Economic Talks End Without Trade Breakthrough</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration renewed its pledge to
keep the United States open to Japanese investment as a semi-annual
economic meeting between the two nations ended Saturday without any
major breakthroughs on contentious trade issues.
   The administration's team of sub-cabinet officials again pressed
Japan to open its markets to a greater variety of American goods,
including supercomputers and forest products, and made clear the
administration favors an open investment policy on both sides of
the Pacific, said chief U.S. negotiator Richard T. McCormack.
   McCormack, undersecretary of state for economic affairs, sought
to calm the anxiety of his Japanese counterparts about the alarm
expressed by some members of Congress and others over recent
purchases of U.S. companies and other properties by investors in
Japan. Examples include the Sony Corp.'s acquisition of Columbia
Pictures and Mitsubishi Real Estate's purchase of Rockefeller
Center in New York City.
   The administration believes that, as a debtor nation, the United
States should welcome the influx of capital from abroad. ``We think
the United States benefits from foreign investments _ but an
important part of that is encouraging other countries to open their
own investment climates,'' said McCormack.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Koji Watanabe, who led the Japanese team
during the two-day round of talks, said ``there's a perception that
the Japanese market is closed'' to U.S. investors. ``Actually,
there are very, very few restrictions imposed by the government on
incoming investments.''
   Watanabe acknowledged, however, that current exchange rates and
Japanese stock prices, viewed as artificially high by Americans,
serve to discourage U.S. investors.
   Though no specific progress was reported by either side
concerning U.S. demands that Japan relax its curbs against certain
American products, each team expressed optimism for future
agreements. ``We managed in the past to resolve the tobacco
question, the telecommunications question,'' said Watanabe. ``We
can manage to resolve the others, because the pain of not doing so
will be greater than the pain of doing so.''
   Both teams pointed to recent improvements in the huge U.S. trade
deficit, which declined 22 percent last year and, according to
McCormack is down a further 7 percent so far this year. American
exports to Japan, said Watanabe, are up by 18.8 percent, or an
increase of $10 billion, compared to last year.
   Watanabe said also that 10 firms from the U.S. construction
industry, which has long complained about being virtually shut out
from Japan, have landed contracts worth $400 million in recent
months.
   The Japanese official, noting estimates that a cut of $1 in the
federal deficit produces a 50-cent reduction in the trade deficit,
said he is ``very encouraged by the commitment of the United
States'' to control deficit spending.
   Most of the same negotiators return Monday and Tuesday for a
separate round of talks, known as the Structural Impediment
Initiative, to focus on non-trade issues affecting the United
States' $50 billion trade deficit with Japan.

   The government said Saturday that
thousands of Contra rebels from neighboring Nicaragua may seek
refuge in Honduras because of an offensive by Nicaragua's
Sandinista Army.
   ``Effective now, the anti-Sandinista rebels can enter Honduras
... and our soldiers will not fight with them,'' government
spokesman Marco Tulio Romero told The Associated Press.
   Military spokesman Col. Manuel Suarez Benavides said the Contras
will not be allowed to enter Honduras armed. Tulio Romero said they
must be out of Honduras by December, as specified in a peace plan
signed by Central American presidents in August.
   Last week, President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua ended a 19-month
cease-fire between his government and the Contras, saying the
rebels had been staging attacks and hampering voter registration
for February elections.
   Sandinista troops have launched a major offensive against Contra
strongholds in recent days.
   ``The attitude of President Jose Azcona Hoyo is humanitarian.
The Contras are beaten and don't have the ability to confront
Nicaragua's government forces,'' Tulio Romero said.
   Honduras has been trying to get rid of the 12,000 Contras and
their dependents living in camps near the border. It
enthusiastically backed the August peace accords calling on the
Contras to be relocated or repatriated before the end of the year.
   In exchange, Ortega promised political reforms and free
elections Feb. 25, 1990.
   A Contra leader applauded the Honduran move to allow them into
the country.
   ``Once again Honduras has shown its humanitarian sentiments of
brotherhood to offer protection to Nicaraguans who are persecuted
by other Nicaraguans,'' said Adolfo Calero in a telephone interview
from Miami.
   ``We are confronting an emergency in our ranks, but we have
ordered our combatants to avoid any contact with communist soldiers
and only defend themselves to save their lives,'' Calero added.
   Enrique Bermudez, military head of the Contras, said in
September that 4,000 to 6,000 Contras were in Nicaragua.
   In Managua, the Nicaraguan government has said its soldiers are
fighting 3,000 Contras in eight provinces around the country.
   The Contras have been fighting Nicaragua's leftist government
since 1981. They receive non-lethal aid from the United States.

<HEAD>IRS Wants to Know if Criminal Defendants Paid Cash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Internal Revenue Service is sending shockwaves
through the ranks of criminal defense attorneys with a letter
demanding they reveal whether any of their clients paid large
lawyer bills with cash.
   Miami attorney Neal Sonnett, president of the National
Association of Criminal Lawyers, said upset lawyers from around the
country are calling him to complain that the new tactic violates
the fundamental right of attorney-client privilege.
   ``They are very disturbed about this,'' said Sonnett, ``There
are a lot of lawyers who believe this is a major crisis and
confrontation.''
   The letter, signed by Christopher J. Lezovich, an IRS official
in Detroit, was sent to attorneys around the country giving them 30
days to identify clients who paid them more than $10,000 in cash.
   The letter includes IRS Form 8300, which among other things
requests filers to give the amount ``paid in $100 bills.''
   The form also asks for the clients' names, addresses, Social
Security numbers, place of business, source of income and other
information.
   And the letter includes a warning from the IRS as well.
   ``Failing to voluntarily submit the requested information could
result in summons enforcement action being initiated,'' Lezovich
writes.
   The criminal justice arm of the American Bar Association was
meeting in Washington on Saturday to discuss the IRS action.
   Tax collectors are acting under a disclosure law passed by
Congress in 1985 over the objections of the ABA, and initially
widely ignored. The law was aimed at exposing tax evaders,
including major drug dealers who often transact business in cash.
   The original penalties for failure to disclose were only
misdemeanors. But a year ago, Congress reclassified violations as
felonies punishable by up to 10 years in prison, and the IRS _ at
least in Detroit _ is now cracking down.
   The law goes directly against the rules of many state bar
associations, including Florida's, leaving attorneys in an ethical
dilemma.
   ``It has said flatly the lawyer may not provide the information
without an express waiver from the client,'' Sonnett said.
   The bar associations have said that exposing client affairs to
the government, or anyone else, is a clear violation of
attorney-client privilege.
   ``We could lose our license or be subject to contempt
proceedings,'' complained Miami lawyer Janice Sharpstein, whose
firm received one of the IRS communications.
   Jose Quinon, president of the Florida Criminal Lawyers
Association, said the law in effect is forcing defense attorneys to
become the reluctant allies of prosecutors. He said the information
provided to the government could then be used to help win
convictions or obtain indictments.
   Some attorneys previously had cooperated in part, listing the
cash they received, but excluding any details that would identify
the client. Until the recent letter, the IRS had been lenient in
its interpretation.
   IRS officials have acknowledged the letter was sent, but refused
to comment further.
   Sonnett suggested that the Detroit office may have acted on its
own.
   ``We're fairly well satisfied it's not national policy by the
Treasury Department or the Justice Department,'' he said. ``We are
told the matter is under review.''

<HEAD>Celebrated Young AIDS Patient Tries To Live Normal Life</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATIE FAIRBANK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seventeen-year-old Ryan White wants to live
as a normal teen-ager, not as the AIDS patient who once faced
pickets and lawsuits, not as star of an award-winning educational
TV show or the friend of Michael Jackson.
   But Ryan is all those things.
   He and his family received national attention four years ago
when he was barred from Western Middle School near Kokomo by
officials who feared he could spread AIDS to other students.
   A judge later ruled that Ryan should be allowed to attend
school, because acquired immune deficiency syndrome is not spread
through casual contact.
   The controversy split the community, and Ryan's family moved 20
miles away to Cicero, a town of about 3,200 people, where school
officials and other students welcomed Ryan.
   ``I like it here so much better _ just feeling like everybody
else,'' Ryan said in a telephone interview Friday.
   In many ways Ryan is a typical teen-age boy. He hangs out with
his friends, goes to movies and gets pizza on the weekend. Last
spring he went to the school prom.
   Also, like many teen-agers with new driver's licenses, Ryan
spends his time driving his car, cleaning his car and browsing
through automotive shops.
   ``He's got a Ford Mustang craze,'' said his mother, Jeanne White.
   What's different for this teen-ager is that the 1989 red Mustang
was a gift from his friend Michael Jackson.
   The pop superstar and Ryan became friends after they met at a
retirement party for basketball legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar last
May. The pair went four-wheeling together and have been in contact
since.
   ``It's a really good relationship. They have a good time,'' Mrs.
White said. ``Michael treats Ryan like he's not sick. And Ryan
treats Michael like he's not a celebrity.''
   Most teen-agers also aren't associated with an Emmy award
nominee. A 30-minute educational TV program that Ryan made was
nominated last year for a children's Emmy.
   ``I Have AIDS _ A Teen-Ager's Story: A 3-2-1 Contact Extra'' on
PBS lost the Emmy to Marlo Thomas' ``Free To Be ... A Family,'' but
did garner a George Peabody award and an Ollie award for children's
programming. It is being distributed by the federal Centers for
Disease Control to help teach about AIDS. He also had a bit part in
a television drama about his case, playing an older AIDS patient.
   Ryan, who hopes to work in broadcasting, wants to attend
part-time vocational classes next year as a senior to study radio
and television.
   He also hopes to go on to college, but for now, he has to look
after his health.
   ``This year's been really rough,'' his mother said. Ryan has not
been able to shake infections in both of his legs and in his eyes,
Mrs. White said.
   On Dec. 1 he is scheduled to undergo a hernia operaion at Riley
Hospital for Children. Because of the infections and a lowered
blood platelet count, the operation has been delayed, Mrs. White
said.
   Ryan is a hemophiliac and contracted AIDS through a
blood-clotting agent used to treat his disease. He was diagnosed
with AIDS in December 1984 when he was 13. A year later, scientists
had a way to inactivate the AIDS virus in clotting factors.
   In 1987 Ryan began taking the AIDS-fighting drug AZT. He has had
no side effects from the drug, which he takes in capsule form six
times a day.
   ``It's done wonders for him,'' Mrs. White said.
   Ryan's infections have kept him home during part of this school
year. Mrs. White said he attends school for two or three days and
then has to stay home for the rest of the week because of the pain
and discomfort.
   ``He's a courageous young man. He's really quite amazing,'' said
Jerri Corwin, spokeswoman for Athletes and Entertainers for Kids, a
children's service charity that is planning a tribute to Ryan.
   ``Ryan represents all the youngsters who have acquired AIDS and
their fight,'' charity spokeswoman Elise Kim added.

   East German refugees, many
refusing to believe their government agreed to let them emigrate
freely to the West, continued to swarm the West German Embassy here
Saturday to request asylum.
   The last of more than 5,000 East Germans who had been holed up
in the embassy left for West Germany on Saturday, one day after the
Communist government in East Berlin said it would not stop them
from crossing the border.
   But crowds of skeptical or uninformed East Germans continued to
gather in front of the embassy's iron gate, seeking entry in the
mistaken belief that they had to force their way West the same way
their predecessors did _ by seeking sanctuary at a Western embassy.
   Some needed little convincing when told they could now go
directly over the border to West Germany. They cheered and grinned
widely before jumping into their cars for the trip to freedom.
   Others remained distrustful.
   ``I can't believe it,'' said one long-haired teen-ager after an
embassy employee told him the latest developments. He then walked
up to several West German journalists, asking each separately: ``Is
it true, is it really true?''
   The decision to open Czechoslovakia's borders to East Germans
seeking to settle in West Germany followed a nationally televised
speech by East German Communist leader Egon Krenz, who pledged
reform and urged an end to the exodus of his countrymen.
   Tens of thousands of East Germans have left for the West from
Soviet bloc countries since August _ some after seeking sanctuary
in West German embassies in Prague and Warsaw. Most have used
Hungary as a springboard after it threw open its border to Austria
on Sept. 10 for East German citizens.
   A young man who fled through Hungary six weeks ago was among
those in front of the embassy Saturday afternoon, but he wasn't
seeking entry.
   Now a West German citizen, he had come to Prague to look for his
wife and baby. The trio were reunited with the help of embassy
personnel.
   A larger group of East Germans hung their apartment keys on a
rope and dangled it from an embassy window before leaving.
   ``There are still empty apartments in East Germany,'' yelled one
of them, alluding to the housing shortage in West Germany.
   Several East Germans told reporters that Czechoslovak taxi
drivers had demanded up to $100 for the trip between the main train
station and the embassy, instead of the normal fare of $4.

   As many as 1 million East Germans chanting
``Freedom! Freedom!'' filled the streets of the capital Saturday
for an emotional pro-democracy rally that was the largest in the
Communist nation's 40-year history.
   The crowd jeered Communist Party leaders and cheered opposition
speakers. Scores of people draped pro-democracy banners from their
apartment balconies and several elderly East Berliners wept with
emotion as demonstrators marched past.
   The three-hour rally, sanctioned by authorities, came a day
after Communist leader Egon Krenz announced the dismissal of five
Politburo members, promised broad political and economic reforms
and urged East Germans to be patient and stay in their homeland.
   But thousands of disillusioned East Germans ignored his pleas
and continued to pour into neighboring Czechoslovakia, which threw
open its western frontier to refugees seeking new lives in West
Germany.
   For many of those who stayed behind, the focus was on the rally
in East Berlin's sprawling Alexanderplatz and on smaller rallies in
several other East German cities.
   People from all over East Germany flocked to the capital, which
has a population of 1.2 million, to urge democratic changes.
   The state-run news agency ADN said 500,000 demonstrators jammed
the vast downtown square and surrounding streets. Witnesses,
organizers and even East Berlin police estimated the crowd at
closer to 1 million.
   ``After four decades we have found our voices again,'' said
Stefan Heym, a prominent East German writer.
   ``We are demonstrating for freedom, for a better life,'' said an
East Berlin woman who came to the protest with her young son.
   Many carried signs deriding Krenz and the Communist Party,
expressing distrust and despair that have mounted through four
decades of rigid rule.
   ``The eyes of the people are on you,'' one banner warned the
leadership. ``We want glasnost, not sugar-coating,'' demanded
another.
   Other banners challenged the leading role of the Communist Party
and demanded ``life without secret police terror.'' Many held up
banners of the New Forum opposition group. The crowd often chanted
``Freiheit, Freiheit (freedom, freedom).''
   Placards calling for an end to Communist rule were pasted on the
walls of several government buildings, including Parliament.
   East German state-controlled radio and television carried live
coverage of the rally, indicating the media's greater openness
under Krenz's leadership.
   Speakers addressing the crowd included members of opposition
groups, church officials, party functionaries and prominent artists.
   They demanded an end to the Communists' monopoly on power, free
trade unions, an end to censorship, release of political prisoners
and free elections.
   Opposition leaders were cheered and party officials booed and
whistled at as they spoke from a platform mounted on a truck.
   One of the biggest cheers went up when a non-communist
politician repeated his demand for the resignation of the entire
leadership.
   The call was made by Manfred Gerlach, leader of the Liberal
Democratic Party. The party has led the drive for more independence
by the four small parties that until now had been closely
affiliated with the Communists.
   The Communists' unpopularity was made evident when East Berlin
party chief and Politburo member Guenter Schabowski took the stand.
   Schabowski, who was instrumental in allowing Saturday's
demonstration, was repeatedly interupted by boos and whistles until
an organizer stepped in and urged people to let him speak.
   Schabowski's reassertion of East Germany's ``steadfast
alliance'' with the Soviet Union drew loud jeers.
   Jens Reich, a New Forum leader, received loud applause when he
called for free elections. He said opposition groups should be
``fully recognized'' and not just tolerated by Communist
authorities.
   Markus Wolf, who headed the country's espionage agency for
nearly 30 years before stepping down in 1987, drew cheers and
applause. Wolf has emerged as a chief supporter of reforms and
there has been growing speculation he could assume a top leadership
role.
   Speaking of violent police attacks against pro-democracy
demonstrators in early October, Wolf said: ``We must never allow
those times to return.''
   One Hungarian student was cheered when he called for a union of
democratic movements throughout Eastern Europe. Another speaker
received long applause when he offered apologies to Czechoslovakia
for the Warsaw Pact invasion that crushed the ``Prague Spring''
reform movement in 1968.
   Hundreds of thousands of East Germans have demonstrated in
recent weeks across the country for democratic reforms. But
Saturday's rally surpassed by far any gathering seen to date.
   ADN said that on Saturday, 40,000 people also demonstrated in
Magdeburg, 12,000 in Altenburg, and several thousand in both
Potsdam and Arnstadt. Later, ADN said 30,000 demonstrated in
Rostock, 25,000 in Plauen and 20,000 in Suhl. Several thousand
people also took part in protests in three small towns in northern
East Germany.
   The tolerance of dissent and the promise of reforms by the new
Krenz government, which replaced the hard-line regime of Erich
Honecker last month, has failed to stop the exodus to the West.
   More than 70,000 East Germans have fled their country in recent
months, dissatisfied with Communist Party rule. Thousands more
joined them over the weekend.
   ``Trust our policy of renewal. Your place, dear fellow citizens,
is here. We need you!'' Krenz said in his Friday night address
broadcast nationally.

<HEAD>Jury in Liability Trial Finds Against Gore-Tex Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ELKTON, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury has cleared three chemical
manufacturers in a lawsuit brought by textile workers who tried to
prove that their exposure to a toxic chemical gave them a crippling
lung disease.
   A Cecil County Circuit Court jury decided after four hours of
deliberations Friday that the manufacturers were not liable for the
conditions of 25 Maryland and Delaware residents who worked at W.L.
Gore &amp; Associates plants.
   The workers said their health and their lives were ruined by a
chemical used in making Gore-Tex, a waterproof fabric widely used
in athletic clothing and parkas.
   They sought about $20 million collectively for the loss of
wages, health costs and pensions. They also asked for an
unspecified amount for pain and suffering.
   As the jury walked out of the courtroom after a nine-week trial
that began in June, some of the workers sobbed in a nearby hallway.
   ``I was shocked,'' said Rick Palmer, 29, who has worked at Gore
since he was 18. ``If the chemical companies aren't at fault, who
is at fault?''
   Wendy Fleischman, one of the workers' attorneys, promised to
appeal.
   The workers tried to prove that Mobay Corp., W.R. Grace &amp; Co.
and E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. failed to give Gore &amp; Associates
information on how to handle the chemical safely. Under Maryland
law, the workers could not sue Gore itself.
   The workers say they inhaled toluene diisocyanate, known as TDI,
at unsafe levels until Gore temporarily closed its Cherry Hill
plant production line near Elkton in May 1986 after workers became
ill.
   The three chemical companies argued that they sent Gore
product-safety information, including a warning that, when
possible, TDI should be used in a closed system that keeps workers
from being exposed, said David C. Allen, an attorney for W.R. Grace
and Du Pont.
   Plaintiffs have said they cannot work because of inflammatory
lung disease that restricts their breathing, their families are
financially and emotionally shaken, and some have developed a
hypersensitivity to various products, ranging from perfumes to
floor cleaners.
   The chemical companies argued that many of the workers were
heavy smokers, which could have caused their lung problems, and
that some of their complaints, such as chemical hypersensitivity,
have not been proved to be linked to TDI.
   ``It was not medically possible to say that TDI caused their
problems,'' Allen said.
   When the problem started, Charles Dean, 44, said, ``I don't
think a lot of us knew what was happening to us. We started getting
sick, but no one associated the chemical exposure to the illness.''
   Finally, Gore began investigating why workers were getting ill
and discovered that monitoring equipment in the plant was
underestimating how much TDI was in the air, said Robert J.
Weltchek, a lawyer for the workers.
   The workers argued that Mobay knew that the air-monitoring was
not adequate and had discovered a more accurate technique, but
failed to inform Gore, Weltchek said.
   Several of the workers said they do not feel ill will toward
Gore. The company investigated the problem, they said, and has
adapted the equipment in the Cherry Hill plant to make it safer.
Palmer said the company has kept him on its payroll even though he
is often sick.
   ``They have been behind me 100 percent. ... They lived the
nightmare with us,'' Palmer said.

   Rock star Sting is Mack the Knife in the ``3
Penny Opera'' now playing on Broadway, but his leading lady,
Maureen McGovern, is not on the boards.
   Miss McGovern, who plays Polly Peachum in the Bertolt
Brecht-Kurt Weill musical, has been out of the show since Oct. 27
with a broken blood vessel in her vocal cords, said her
spokeswoman, Judy Katz. The show has been in previews and is
officially opening Sunday.
   She is expected back in the musical in about a week, Miss Katz
said Friday.
   Until then, Miss McGovern's role will be played by her
understudy, Nancy Ringham, said Pete Sanders, a spokesman for ``3
Penny Opera.''
   ``3 Penny Opera,'' is based on the underworld of Victorian
England. Sting plays Macheath, a rakish brigand nicknamed Mack the
Knife. The production opened recently to poor reviews in Washington.

   A parachutist who was to deliver the game
football to his son on homecoming day was found dead on the ground
a few blocks from where a crowd had waited for him in the Lake Mary
High School stadium.
   Al Migliorato, 38, was supposed to land at the field Friday
night during pre-game festivities. He had gone to the school that
morning to pick up a football helmet and the ceremonial ball.
   His son Allan, a senior on the high school's football team and a
member of the student government, came up with the idea for his
father to jump, said Principal Don T. Reynolds.
   ``The first parachutist delivered the flag,'' Reynolds said.
``And we kept waiting for Mr. Migliorato. He never showed, and we
weren't sure if he had just stayed inside the plane.''
   The game between Lake Mary and DeLand kicked off on schedule,
and according to Reynolds, spectators could not tell anything was
wrong until they heard emergency vehicle sirens throughout the
neighborhood.
   ``I kind of knew there was a problem at halftime,'' Lake Mary
coach Doug Peters said. ``I don't believe Allan knew about his
father until after the game. We were still on the field, and he
walked over with his mother to tell me the news and gave me a hug.
He wasn't sure what to do.''
   Lake Mary Fire Department's rescue squad answered an emergency
call about 7:20 p.m. that a man was in the roadway in the Eagle
Creek subdivision. Five minutes later, the rescue squad found the
victim in the middle the road, about four blocks from the school,
said police communications supervisor Jeff Ballard.
   Ballard said the victim's chute was open, and officials weren't
sure exactly how he died. He didn't know how much experience
Migliorato had at parachute jumping.
   Migliorato was flown by helicopter to South Seminole Community
Hospital in Longwood, but was dead on arrival.
   Reynolds said the school's crisis team would meet Monday to help
students deal with the tragedy, and the student government would
plan some type of memorial.

<HEAD>Shunned Hostage Recalls Tehran Embassy Seizure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COOPER CITY, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 10th anniversary of the seizure of
the U.S. Embassy in Tehran brings bitter memories to Joseph Subic,
the only military hostage rejected for a decoration after 444 days
in captivity.
   The Army says the former non-commissioned officer appeared in a
film criticizing the U.S role in Iran, and, when tortured,
disclosed facts about other hostages.
   Subic, 33, now a law enforcement officer for Florida's
Department of Agriculture, strongly disagrees with the Army's
reasoning in not awarding him the Defense Meritorious Service Medal.
   He said he told his captors only what they already knew by
perusing the numerous undestroyed files left in the embassy. All he
did, he says, is confirm his signature on specific documents _ and
he notes he received an honorable discharge.
   ``If I'm bitter or not is immaterial, Iran is in the past. I
live for the present,'' he said in an interview in Saturday's
Sun-Sentinel of Fort Lauderdale. ``You never forget those 444 days.
But you accept them.''
   Subic thinks he was a scapegoat. He does not turn away from what
he did because he thinks there is no need to. He said he simply
obeyed the Iranian radicals who took him prisoner.
   ``I read whatever they asked me to. I have no idea what it
said,'' said Subic.
   He did it, he said, ``Because death was always there. So was the
isolation.''
   On Nov. 4, 1979, six months after he arrived in Iran and armed
with a shotgun and a 9mm pistol, Subic was informed the chancellery
of the embassy had been breached. He was the first military person
to have armed contact with the Iranians.
   ``I would have shot but it was a question of whether deadly
force was necessary. They led with women in front of them. To shoot
unarmed people was wrong. We had standards to maintain.
   ``We thought we'd be kept 20 or 30 minutes and the government
would come and retake the embassy.''
   They were wrong. After destroying many sensitive documents, they
surrendered, were handcuffed, and were lined up against a window.
   ``They then put guns to the back of our heads and we heard a
metallic click,'' he recalled.
   But Subic said he was unafraid.
   ``On the day of the takeover, I had no fear of dying because I
was defending the embassy and doing my job. After that, I began to
wonder, `What am I going to die for?'''
   The sergeant _ at 23, he was already a six-year Army veteran _
believed in his country and in its president.
   When he returned to this country in 1980, he still did. But it
had been a long 444 days.
   ``I don't know if I lost faith. But I wondered, where is my
country? I was not disillusioned by America; I was disillusioned
that we didn't receive the proper training, that they didn't
understand the magnitude of the situation,'' he said.
   During those days, Subic read the Bible because there was
nothing else to read, he says. He read it completely through
several times. He read high school textbooks. He found out the shah
of Iran was dead by reading The Sporting News. He found out about
yellow ribbons that way, too.
   ``We couldn't understand yellow ribbons.''
   Without bitterness, he says: ``What were yellow ribbons going to
do for us? We wanted to see B-52s.''
   He tried escaping once.
   ``At least, then, I would know what would happen. I tied sheets
together and went. I made it 200 yards. I got beat up, I sucked a
.45. They tied me up with electrical wire and kept me awake for
days.
   ``But I don't really equate the physical torture so much when
compared to the mental torture. They'd come in with hoods over
their heads. They'd handcuff you, put you against a wall and put a
gun to your head. Your knees would buckle and they'd laugh.''
   Still, the young man from Redford Township, Mich., says it was
his job and he did it.
   He knows some of the other 51 hostages, the ones with whom he
briefly shared an entire world inside a single room. Today, they
exchange Christmas cards.
   ``I have my new life to live,'' Subic said.
   He does not question what the military decided to do about his
medal. He says that life is too short, that he is no loser, that he
has proved that. And that in the future, others will realize that.
   ``Someday I'll be able to hold up my medal. I haven't done
anything wrong.''

<HEAD>Suspected Collaborator Killed, Report on Wounded Canadian Journalist</HEAD>

   A Palestinian suspected of collaborating with
Israel was hacked to death with an ax Saturday and his body dumped
in a Gaza City street, Arab reports said.
   In the occupied West Bank, an 11-year-old Arab boy had both legs
and his right hand blown off when a bomb exploded in his house.
Palestinians blamed Israelis for the bombing and the army said the
device apparently was detonated by someone inside the house.
   The army completed its investigation into Monday's shooting of a
Canadian journalist in the Gaza Strip and said the soldiers
responsible had violated regulations.
   Jean Francois Lepine of the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. was hit
in the leg by a rubber-coated steel pellet and slightly wounded
when troops opened fire on rioting Palestinians.
   ``An investigation revealed that the army force in the area did
not act according to regulations and the necessary conclusions will
be taken accordingly,'' an army statement said.
   It did not elaborate on the type of regulations or say what
action might be taken against the soldiers involved.
   The explosion that seriously wounded the Arab boy at his home in
Hebron also injured his parents, four brothers and a sister.
   Arab reporters said rumors spread through the city that either
Israeli soldiers or Jewish settlers had thrown a bomb into the
house or it had been dropped from an army helicopter.
   ``Its natural for them to start spreading these rumors, but the
fact is there were no army forces in the area at the time of the
explosion,'' said a military spokesman.
   A police commander in the area told The Associated Press
investigators believed the explosion was caused by someone in the
house.
   ``An initial investigation revealed the explosion occured when
someone was playing with a hand grenade or some other explosive
device,'' he said.
   State-run Israel radio reported police were considering the
possiblity that someone was preparing a homemade bomb and it
exploded.
   Doctors at Hebron's Alia Hospital said Mansur Hadi Stpih's legs
and right hand were mangled and had to be amputated.
   They said the boy's sister, Sabah, 14, suffered shrapnel wounds
and multiple fractures and was taken to Mukassad Hospital in East
Jerusalem.
   Four younger brothers and both parents received slight wounds,
according to the doctors.
   The father, Omar Ahmad Stpih, 34, told Arab reporters he did not
know what happened. ``All I heard was the children crying and then
I saw blood on my face. I forgot everything else,'' he said.
   Hebron is the site of frequent clashes between the city's 50,000
Palestinians and some 5,000 Jewish settlers who live in the city
center and in the nearby Kiryat Arba settlelment.
   Officials identified the suspected collaborator as Ahmad
Mohammad Sulieman, 36, whose body was found in a Gaza City street.
Hospitals officials said Sulieman, a resident of the Nuseriat
refugee camp, was killed by ax blows to the neck and head.
   His death raised to 141 the number of Palestinians killed by
fellow Arabs for suspected collaboration with Israeli authorities
since the uprising against the Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip
and West Bank began in December 1987.
   At least 609 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers
or civilians in the uprising and 40 Israelis have perished in the
violence.

   Three former Iran hostages laid a wreath
Saturday at Arlington National Cemetery to honor the eight U.S.
servicemen who died in the abortive 1980 attempt to rescue
Americans being held captive in Tehran.
   Taking part in the ceremony were former hostages Richard Queen,
William Royer and retired Air Force Col. David Roeder.
   ``It's a very humbling thing, for someone to volunteer to give
his life, ... to regain freedom for, as far as I know, people they
didn't know personally,'' Roeder said at the ceremony.
   ``I felt very proud of this country, in the way that they didn't
abandon us,'' he said.
   Royer called it a day of reflection.
   ``My heart goes out to the families of the hostages still being
held in Beirut, the anguish and uncertainty that they're
experiencing, and to the families of the service personnel who were
lost in the rescue attempt,'' Royer said.
   The wreath-laying at the Iran Rescue Mission Plaque in the
cemetery was followed by the playing of taps.
   The tribute was sponsored by No Greater Love, a humanitarian
organization which promoted the yellow ribbon campaign during the
Iran hostage crisis and now seeks to assist the families of
Americans being held in Lebanon.
   Bruce Laingen, a board member of No Greater Love, said in a
statement: ``As a former hostage in Iran, I fervently appeal to
those who hold hostage our eight countrymen and others in Beirut
today, and to those who can influence them, to restore these men to
freedom and their families.
   ``Their continued incarceration can serve no one's purpose and
is a tragic offense to human rights,'' he said.

   A presidential candidate whose
predecessor was killed by drug traffickers canceled two campaign
stops after a bomb was found on a bridge hours before he was to
cross it, a campaign official said Saturday.
   The candidate, Cesar Gaviria, was in charge of the campaign of
Sen. Luis Carlos Galan until drug traffickers assassinated the
senator at an Aug. 18 political rally. Gaviria then decided to run
for the presidency.
   Meanwhile, a Colombian businessman under cocaine indictments in
Florida, California and Illinois was handed over to U.S.
authorities in Bogota and flown Saturday to Talahassee, Fla.
   Guillermo Bueno Delgado, 54, a hotel owner and investor in
Colombia, was arrested Sept. 14 and the U.S. Justice Department
asked for his extradition to face charges, beginning with a Florida
indictment.
   Bueno is the sixth Colombian turned over to U.S. authorities and
extradited since August, when Galan's assassination prompted
President Virgilio Barco to declare war on drug traffickers and end
a ban on extraditions to the United States.
   On Friday, federal agents assigned to protect Gaviria discovered
a dynamite bomb under a bridge on the road between Cienaga and
Fundacion, two towns on Colombia's northern coast, the Gaviria
campaign coordinator told The Associated Press in Bogota.
   Gaviria, one of three leading presidential contenders, was to
travel the road just hours after the bomb was found, the
coordinator said, speaking on the condition he not be named.
   The campaign official said no group claimed responsibility for
the bomb, which caused Gaviria to cancel campaign stops at Cienaga
and Fundacion. He said there was no indication it was intended for
the candidate.
   Gaviria's political organizer for the state, Juan Carlos Vives,
said in a news conference that leftist guerrillas were responsible.
His comments were broadcast Saturday by the national radio chain
RCN.
   The national coordinator, however, denied that anyone in the
campaign had received any information implicating guerrillas.
   ``It is unclear who is responsible for the attack,'' he said.
``It could have been any one of a number of groups, including drug
traffickers and guerrillas.''
   Gaviria remained in the port city of Santa Marta on Saturday
while his staff considered alternative appearances.
   ``We are determined to continue the campaign,'' the coordinator
said.
   The candidate has portrayed himself as Galan's political heir
and has adopted many of the slain senator's positions, including
his strong opposition to drug traffickers.
   The campaign official said Gaviria had received several death
threats from anonymous callers in recent weeks.
   In a speech last week, Gaviria reiterated his support of the
government's extradition of drug traffickers.
   Since Barco declared war on traffickers and enacted emergency
extradition measures, traffickers have retaliated with a wave of
bombings and assassinations of public officials, including two
federal judges and a leading leftist politician.
   Judges and court workers went on strike nationwide on Friday to
demand more protection.
   Presidential candidates did not appear in public for two weeks
after Galan's death because of the threat of another assassination
attempt by traffickers.
   In recent weeks, candidates have increased the number of
appearances at political rallies and other functions, but only
under the strictest security measures. The intense security is
likely to continue until the presidential elections May 27.
   Gaviria's coordinator said at least 300 security troops guarded
the candidate at every campaign stop.
   Galan had a 63-member security contigent when he was killed. The
candidate was wearing a bulletproof vest and was surrounded by nine
body guards carrying submachine guns, automatic rifles and pistols
when assassins shot and killed him.
   The head of the intellegence police, Miguel Maza Marquez, last
week said an official investigation into the killing of Galan
proved that leaders of the powerful Medellin cocaine cartel ordered
it.

<HEAD>Rebels Denounce Aquino Visit to the U.S.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist rebels on Saturday
criticized President Corazon Aquino's visit to the United States as
a mission to determine her government's price for extending U.S.
use of military bases here.
   Mrs. Aquino arrived Saturday in Vancouver, British Columbia, the
first stop on her eight-day visit to the United States and Canada.
Officials have said the goal of her trip is to project a stable
Philippines economy and spur foreign investment and commitments to
help relieve the country's $28 billion foreign debt.
   Hours before she left Manila early Saturday police dispersed
thousands of supporters of the late President Ferdinand Marcos with
tear gas and water cannons. Marcos was ousted in a 1986
military-civilian uprising and forced into exile in Hawaii. Mrs.
Aquino has refused to allow the body to be returned for burial in
the Philippines.
   The National Democratic Front, a coalition of 14 underground
Marxist groups, said in a statement that despite denials from Mrs.
Aquino and U.S. officials, her trip is a step closer to extending a
military-bases pact that expires in 1991.
   Mrs. Aquino's speech before departing made no mention of any
possible meeting with U.S. authorities on the bases issue.
   ``Mrs. Aquino is on her way to a mission of mendicancy to the
United States that shall see her trading away the country's
soverignty in exchange for precious dollars to bail out the
faltering Philippine economy,'' the guerrillas group said.
   ``Talks on aid, trade and investment, on which the visit is
focused, actually form part of the bargaining process that shall
determine the Aquino's regime's final asking price for the renewal
of the bases treaty,'' it added.
   The guerrillas said they would begin a cease-fire and open talks
to end their 20-year-old insurgency if Mrs. Aquino publicly came
out against renewing the treaty.
   Mrs. Aquino has not stated a position on the bases.
   Under the pact, the United States maintains Clark Air Base, the
Subic Bay naval station and four other smaller U.S. facilities in
exchange for about $480 million in annual aid.
   The bases employ nearly 79,000 Filipinos who earn about $100
million a year.
   In the southern Philippines, Moslem insurgents attacked a
government outpost, killing five people, the military reported.
   Lt. Col. Omar Manabilang, the constabulary provincial commander,
said the guerrillas attacked the outpost in the coastal town of
Balabagan, 535 miles southeast of Manila, Friday and then escaped
by boat.

   The Ethiopian government and rebels from Tigre
Province opened preliminary peace talks Saturday in an effort to
end the insurgents' 15-year-old war for autonomy.
   Italian government observers sat in on the talks, which are
designed to iron out procedural problems before full-fledged
negotiations are held. Italy has had meetings with Ethiopia, which
it occupied from 1936 to 1941.
   Officials said the talks, held behind closed doors in a
government villa, could last as long as 15 days.
   Suggestions for general topics for the talks were exchanged
during the brief opening session but more detailed dicussions were
put off until Sunday, said Haile Kiros, a spokesman for the
Tigreans.
   The Tigre People's Liberation Front took up arms 15 years ago in
the province north of the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa.
   In recent weeks, the rebels have scored several major victories
on the battlefield. They have described their offensive as a
pre-emptive strike against mobilizing government forces.
   Despite the rebel offensive, the Ethiopian Embassy said in a
communique that the government ``will continue the search for a
peaceful solution to halt the bloodshed.''
   The government delegation is headed by Ashagre Yigletu, member
of the Central Committee of the Party of Ethiopian Workers. The
Tigre group is led by Meles Zenawi, president of the rebel front's
Central Committee.
   The government of President Mengistu Haile Mariam has also
opened preliminary peace talks with a second major rebel group, the
Eritrean People's Liberation Front.
   Those talks began in Atlanta in September with former President
Jimmy Carter serving as an observer. They are scheduled to resume
in Nairobi, Kenya, this month.

   Blustery winds swept the eastern slopes of the Rockies in
Wyoming and Colorado on Saturday and roads were closed at
Yellowstone National Park, which was hit with 5 inches of snow.
   Wind gusts of up to 60 mph were reported west of Fort Collins,
Colo., and winds gusted to 65 mph near Vedauwoo, Wyo.
   A high wind warning was in effect Saturday night for
southeastern Wyoming. A high wind watch was posted for the front
range and northeast plains of Colorado.
   An advisory for snow and blowing snow was in effect Saturday
night for the northern mountains of Wyoming and the central
mountains of Colorado. Up to 5 inches of snow blanketed the
Yellowstone National Park area, closing many roads.
   Winds at Idaho Falls, Idaho, gusted to 48 mph. Strong winds also
were whipping through the Columbia Basin of eastern Oregon, with
gusts of 48 mph reported at Pendleton.
   An upper level weather disturbance moving out of Montana into
Wyoming was responsible for the snow and gusty winds.
   Showers were scattered from Washington and Oregon to Minnesota
Saturday morning and early afternoon. Skies were sunny across much
of the southern half of the nation.
   Strong southerly winds kept temperatures warm into the 50s and
60s in the Great Plains and middle Mississippi Valley, and in the
60s and 70s in the southern Plains.
   Temperatures reached the 70s and 80s in southern Arizona and
southern California, and across Florida. Temperatures were in the
30s in the upper Mississippi Valley, the upper Great Lakes and
northern New England.

<HEAD>Hundreds of Young Hooligans Vandalize Ferry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A company that operates a ferry service
between Sweden and Finland announced Saturday it would impose age
restrictions on passengers after nearly 900 young hooligans
vandalized the vessel.
   The Swedish-Finnish company Viking Line said the restrictions
would ban people uner the age of 18 from the Viking Sally ferry on
weekdays and all people under 20 on weekend tours.
   Swedish national radio reported scores of policeman were at a
Stockholm dock when the Viking Sally arrived Friday night, scarred
by a rampage by many of the 900 Swedish youths between the ages of
15 and 18 returning from the Finnish city of Turku..
   It said five Swedish youths were arrested on charges of
hooliganism, theft and drunkenness.
   ``I pity the ordinary people who were on the ferry, '' the
national news agency TT quoted police superintendent Gosta Forsgren
as saying. ``They were terrified.''
   He said the young passengers began acting like ``bandits''
shortly after the ship departed from Stockholm Thursday, emptying
fire extinguishers, harassing other passengers and destroying
furnishings.
   Forsgren said one youth was detained by police at Turku for
shooting a fellow passenger in the back with an air pistol.
   The company said the Viking Sally was filled to capacity with
1,350 passengers for the weekend voyage.
   One reason ferry trips between the Swedish east coast and
Finland is alcoholic drinks cost less than in Sweden.

   A woman who police said brought a gun
to a day care center as part of a Halloween costume was indicted on
two felony charges after a 3-year-old boy was shot in the head.
   A grand jury in Leon County indicted Kenda Mahaffey, 30, of
Normangee on Friday on charges of reckless injury to a child and a
charge that relates to carrying firearms at educational facilities.
   The child, Kenny Archer, was in serious but stable condition at
Texas Children's Hospital in Houston, recovering from a bullet
wound to the head.
   The child shot himself with a .22-caliber gun that Mrs. Mahaffey
brought to the Twice As Nice day care center as part of her
Western-style costume, unaware that it was loaded, police said.
   Ms. Mahaffey told investigators she carried the unloaded pistol
to a party the previous weekend and was unaware that her husband
reloaded the gun before she took it to the center on Tuesday,
District Attorney David Barron said.
   Each of the felony charges carries a possible jail term of two
to 10 years and a maximum fine of $10,000. Mahaffey was released
from jail Friday on a personal recognizance bond.

<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 5th graf, `Bush discussed...', to ADD interview published

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush says he intends to keep Vice
President Dan Quayle on the ticket in 1992 because Quayle is doing
an outstanding job and because ``his heart is in it.''
   Bush's endorsement of the vice president marked his first
explicit statement that he would retain Quayle if he seeks
re-election.
   Quayle's press secretary, David Beckwith, said the vice
president would have no comment on Bush's remarks.
   ``He's doing a very good job, an outstanding job,'' Bush said in
an interview with The Dallas Morning News, adding that Quayle is
``doing exactly what I want him to do and doing it because his
heart is in it.''
   Bush discussed a broad range of domestic and foreign issues,
from taxes to U.S. relations with China and the Soviet Union in
Thursday's interview, which was published in Sunday editions.
   The president, who campaigned on a pledge of no new taxes, would
not speculate whether he would look for new sources of revenue next
year.
   ``I said certainly we're going to try to get by this year _ and
we are. We're going to succeed in that. And then we take on next
year.''
   He strongly defended his proposal to cut capital gains taxes
against criticism that it would mainly help the wealthy.
   ``I heard that all during the campaign,'' he snapped. ``So
please don't come in here, after the election debated this fully,
and give me the liberal Democratic line on this.''
   The president also said he is very eager to talk with former
President Nixon, who is meeting with leaders in China. Bush said
Nixon has an ``almost unique standing'' with the Chinese leadership.
   ``And yet I know he shares with me the concerns that all of us
felt about the put-down in Tiananmen Square. So it will be
interesting to see what he does say,'' the president said.
   Bush also said he anticipates a better economic relationship
with the Soviet Union.
   ``As you know, some of that's been tied to the political changes
that have been taking place, '' he said. ``But who would have
predicted a year and a half ago that we would have been been
signing an MFN (Most Favored Nation Treaty) _ changing the MFN
treatment of Hungary?
   ``And so I can foresee a lot of things that I can't say will
happen with finality.''
   Bush was harshly critical of Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega
when Ortega announced a suspension of a cease-fire in his country's
civil war. But the president would not say if aid would resume to
the Contra rebels.
   ``What I don't want to do is give him (Ortega) any excuse
whatever to abort the free elections,'' Bush said. ``So I don't
want to conduct myself in some way to take that public opinion
that's going against him in his own country and in other
democracies and in the United States and inadvertently turn it
around to benefit him.''

<DATELINE>KLEIAT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Christian leader Gen. Michel Aoun said
Saturday he had dissolved Parliament for backing a plan to end
Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war, but lawmakers questioned his
authority and said they would meet anyway.
   The legislators said they would try to gather Sunday at this
northern Lebanon air base to elect a new president to form a
government of national reconciliation.
   Aoun, whose Cabinet is vying for power with a rival Moslem
government, accused Parliament of violating the constitution by
approving an Arab League-brokered accord to end the civil war
without his consent.
   The general, who fought the Syrians for six months until a
cease-fire took hold Sept. 22, rejected the peace plan because it
failed to guarantee a withdrawal of 40,000 Syrians military
personnel from Lebanon.
   Constitutionally, only the president can dissolve Parliament.
But Lebanon has had no head of state since Sept. 22, 1988, when
President Amin Gemayel's six-year term expired with Parliament
unable to decide on a successor.
   Gemayel, a Maronite like Aoun, named the 54-year-old general to
head an interim Cabinet until a new president could be elected.
   Aoun says he has the powers of a head of state as long as the
presidency is vacant and thus has the right to dissolve Parliament.
   Deputies rejected his claim of authority.
   ``I can dissolve the American Congress if I want to, and it
would have the same legitimacy,'' said Pierre Helou, a Maronite
Christian member of Parliament. ``We are recognized by 160
countries. Give me the name of a country that recognizes General
Aoun.''
   Helou and more than two dozen other legislators have been in
Paris since drafting the peace accord last month in Saudi Arabia.
Aoun has called the deputies traitors and threatened to punish them.
   In Paris the legislators declared late Saturday that they will
return home Sunday and prepare to elect a president. Parliament
Speaker Hussein Husseini did not disclose precisely where in
Lebanon the lawmakers would travel to or what time they would
arrive.
   The deputies will fix a site for the parliamentary election ``on
Lebanese soil'' after returning to Lebanon and conferring with
about 40 of their colleagues, Husseini told reporters.
   The Parliament must attract at least 50 of the body's 73 members
to form a quorum and elect a president.
   The Saudi peace accord was endorsed by 59 of the 63 lawmakers
who attended a special parliamentary session called by the Arab
League.
   It would strip the president, traditionally a Maronite
Christian, of some power to give the prime minister and Parliament
speaker, both Moslems, a wider share in decision making.
   Aoun's decree dissolving Parliament was aimed at preventing a
parliamentary election.
   Twenty-four Moslem deputies drove from west Beirut to Kleiat, in
an area policed by Syrian troops, where they were joined by leftist
Christian deputy Najah Wajim. Wajim said deputies do not recognize
Aoun's authority, ``so any decree he issues is illegitimate.''
   Aoun's supporters waged a general strike that paralyzed the
Christian enclave north of Beirut. Angry Christian youngsters
burned tires and shouted slogans against Parliament members.
   About 50,000 people waving Lebanese flags and posters of Aoun
demonstrated outside the shell-wrecked presidential palace in
support of the U.S.-trained general.
   ``We sacrifice our blood for Aoun. Down with the deputies!''
they chanted.
   ``You are the decision makers,'' Aoun, dressed in combat
fatigues, told them. ``The deputies do not represent you.''
   Pope John Paul II, in a message sent to the Lebanese people and
read by Papal Nuncio Pablo Puente to reporters in Beirut, declared
that the country faced the threat of ``partition, chaos and renewed
war.''
   Stressing that the Vatican ``cannot remain neutral,'' the Roman
Catholic leader said: ``It is time ... for sacrifices for the sake
of peace.''
   In what appeared to be an appeal to Aoun to back down, the
message added: ``One should sometimes choose the less painful
options.''
   In Washington, the State Department accused Aoun of undermining
the constitutional structure of Lebanon by dissolving Parliament.
   ``He does a disservice to the state and the people he claims to
defend,'' spokeswoman Nancy Beck said.

<TEXT>
   A 15-month-old boy held at knifepoint by his
mother was rescued when police distracted the woman with a small
explosion, smashed the windows of her car and snatched the child to
safety.
   Tracy Diane Levis, 24, was in the Harris County Jail Saturday on
$300,000 bond on two charges of aggravated assault and one charge
of injury to a child, police Sgt. A.D. Moore said.
   She was taken into custody just after 4 a.m., 13 hours after she
locked herself in the car with her son, Brandon Duke, on a street
in southwest Houston.
   The boy suffered a minor 2-inch laceration on his back and some
dehydration but was in good condition at Ben Taub Hospital, Moore
said. Police believe he was cut by broken glass during the rescue.
   Ms. Levis, whose face was smeared with makeup, has a history of
psychiatric problems and once made a public suicide attempt, police
said. She was in a psychiatric holding cell at the jail and will
undergo testing, Sgt. Michael McGinty said.
   She held a 6-to-8-inch hunting knife near Brandon's throat
during the standoff and appeared to be hallucinating, police said.
She made no demands and did not give any explanation of her actions
during the ordeal, they said.
   The police moved in because of concerns about the child's health
after being locked inside a vehicle for so long.
   Police threw a percussion grenade in front of the car to
distract the woman, and a team of officers stormed the car and
broke the windows. One officer grabbed the child and bolted to a
waiting ambulance.
   ``By the time the mother knew what was going on, we had already
secured the little boy,'' police spokesman Dan Turner said. ``His
safety was our top priority.''
   The incident began about 3 p.m. Friday when Ms. Levis' mother,
Barbara Levis, apparently was trying to take her daughter to a
psychiatric hospital. The two women got into an argument, and
Barbara Levis fled from the car, police said.
   ``I thought it was an accident,'' said Keith Lampton, who saw
the commotion and called police. ``I looked over and I saw her face
was all painted up like Halloween. She was yelling at her mother
and waving a knife toward her.''
   The woman was on some type of medication and told police
negotiators she was hearing strange voices, police said.
   At times, Ms. Levis nuzzled her curly-headed son, bouncing him
on her knees, patting and kissing him. One time she came close to
nicking the child with the blade, then immediately drew back the
knife and checked the baby for wounds, police spokesman Al Baker
said.

   A man who has used a wheelchair since being
hit by a vehicle six years ago was in critical condition Saturday
after being struck by a hit-and-run driver on a suburban highway.
   Joseph Kelly Crook, 25, was crossing the busy six-lane highway
between intersections about 3:30 a.m. Friday when a car hit him and
threw him 60 feet, Hillsborough County Sheriff's spokesman Jack
Espinosa said.
   ``He's got massive internal injuries, and it looks pretty bad,''
Espinosa said. ``He's on a life-support system.''
   Crook was in critical condition after at least two operations
for internal injuries, broken ribs and multiple leg fractures,
officials at St. Joseph's Hospital said.
   Crook lost the use of his legs six years ago when he was struck
by a four-wheel-drive vehicle while driving a motorcycle.

   An Israeli navy patrol stopped a boat off the
Lebanese coast and apprehended three Palestinian guerrillas aboard
the craft, the military command said Saturday.
   It said a navy boat on a routine patrol west of the Lebanese
coast halted a ``suspicious boat moving toward the port of Sidon.''
   Israel's navy carries out regular patrols in the area to stop
guerrillas from infiltrating Israel by sea.
   ``The boat and crew were checked and it was found that most of
them were Palestinian terrorists,'' the military said in a
statement. A later report said three Palesinians were detained for
quesioning and it was suspected they were members of the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   The report did not say how many other people were aboard the
boat but said the vessel was allowed to continue on its voyage.
   Four days ago a guerrilla on a suicide mission exploded his
rubber dinghy near an Israeli navy patrol boat off the Lebanese
coast. Three Israeli sailors were slightly injured.
   The Syrian-based Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine
claimed responsibility for that attack.

<TEXT>
   South Africa's foreign minister said
Saturday he had no evidence of a military threat in Namibia from
nationalist guerrillas and he expected the territory's independence
election to proceed smoothly.
   The remarks by Pik Botha came three days after he said South
Africa might delay the election because of infiltration by
guerrillas of the South-West Africa People's Organization _ SWAPO.
Voting begins Tuesday and will continue through Saturday.
   ``I am leaving Windhoek with the firm impression that there will
be peaceful elections next week in Namibia and that the elections
will be open, free and fair,'' Botha told a news conference
Saturday night.
   Botha met Saturday with SWAPO leader Sam Nujoma; Martti
Ahtisaari, the head of the United Nations contingent in Namibia,
and Angolan Foreign Minister Pedro de Castro van Dunem.
   Botha said Nujoma assured him no guerrillas had infiltrated into
Namibia, also known as South-West Africa, and none was in southern
Angola near Namibia's northern border.
   ``In the absence of any further evidence, I have no choice but
to accept Mr. Nujoma's assurances,'' Botha said.
   South Africa, which has ruled Namibia for 74 years, has agreed
to grant the territory independence under U.N. supervision.
   Ahtisaari, in a television address, said that if the voting went
smoothly he would be prepared to certify the elections free and
fair even before all the ballots were counted.
   The elections had appeared headed for a possible delay when
Botha said Wednesday that members of the U.N. monitoring force
reported in internal radio traffic the infiltration of 600
guerrillas.
   But the United Nations said the messages were fake. Botha
acknowledged on Friday he didn't know who sent the messages but
said they were transmitted on a frequency allocated to the world
body.
   ``As matters now stand, there is no evidence, as far as I am
concerned, that (the U.N.) was responsible for the transmissions.
Who did it remains unclear,'' Botha said.
   Meanwhile, Namibia's 10 political parties sought to bolster
their support with weekend rallies before the balloting.
   Nujoma, speaking Saturday in the southern town of Keetmanshoop,
told a cheering crowd of 6,000 blacks that a government by his
organization would create state farms and cooperatives for landless
blacks.
   ``But we want to make it clear that we will not evict every
white from the land,'' Nujoma said. ``We will only be dealing with
those white foreigners from South Africa and other parts of the
world who continue to own vast tracts of land while residing in a
different country.''
   Nujoma's left-leaning group, which waged a 23-year war against
South African rule, is the heavy favorite in the polls.
   Its main opponent is the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance, a
multiracial coalition that was part of Namibia's transitional
government and favors a capitalist economy.

tax increase. Picks up 6 graf, `Other quake-related...'.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State lawmakers Saturday approved a
quarter-percent increase in California's sales tax to raise $800
million for earthquake relief in northern California.
   Meeting in a special session, the Assembly voted 56-17 and the
Senate 34-2 to approve the proposal over the opposition of some
Republicans, who said the money should come from the state's
emergency reserve instead of new taxes.
   Republican Gov. George Deukmejian said he would sign the bill
early next week.
   Supporters of the 13-month tax, proposed by Deukmejian, said it
was a ``compassionate, humane'' method of financing earthquake
rebuilding.
   But William Baker, the GOP leader of the Assembly's fiscal
committee, said the increase would ``make this tragedy worse by
going out and reaching into the pockets of the people of the state
of California.''
   In the upper house, Republican Sen. Don Rogers called the tax
plan premature. ``Now is not the time to deal with this,'' he said,
adding the money should come instead from the state's
billion-dollar emergency reserve.
   Other quake-related bills under consideration would earmark
money to strengthen roads and bridges, give immediate aid to people
displaced by the quake and provide tax breaks for owners of
quake-damaged property.
   The sales tax increase was intended to finance only a small part
of the costs of rebuilding from the 7.1 magnitude quake that struck
northern California on Oct. 17, killing 66 people and injuring more
than 3,000.
   State authorities have estimated damages at more than $7
billion, including about $1.7 billion to state and county roads.
The federal government has approved a $3.45 billion quake-aid
package.
   Republican opponents of the tax rate increase contended that the
funds could be obtained by cutting other programs and using money
from the state's billion-dollar emergency reserve. Under
Deukmejian's plan, the tax would be imposed for 13 months beginning
Dec. 1, thus capturing revenues from the heavy Christmas shopping
season this year and next.
   Some Democrats also opposed the plan, describing it as
inadequate and calling instead for a half-cent or a full penny per
dollar. The quarter-percent increase would raise the 6 percent
sales tax to 6.25 percent.
   Representatives of the California Retailers Association said
businesses would have trouble reprogramming cash registers to
comply with an increase on such short notice.
   Politicking in both parties intensified as scores of bills, many
of them only marginally related to the quake, were introduced
during the special session, which was ordered by the governor to
consider only earthquake-related measures.
   One Los Angeles-area lawmaker, Democratic Assemblywoman Maxine
Waters, proposed restoring cuts Deukmejian made earlier in the year
to the family planning program, and lobbied fellow Democrats to
include her plan in quake legislation.
   ``There is some feeling right now that there are so many ideas
floating around that the train may be off the track,'' said Ken
Maddy, the Republican leader in the state Senate.
   In other developments:
   _ Emergency shelters throughout the San Francisco Bay area
continued scaling back operations as many of those left homeless
found new homes and jobs.
   ``This is a sign of success; that people are getting out of here
on their own and starting new lives,'' said Lisa Summersell, Red
Cross spokeswoman in San Francisco.
   _ Geologists said an earthquake that struck the Hayward Fault at
11:16 p.m. Friday with a magnitude estimated at 3.6 on the Richter
scale was unrelated to the Oct. 17 quake and more than 100
aftershocks on the San Andreas Fault. The separate quake was
centered about four miles north of San Leandro, said Pat Jorgenson,
a spokeswoman for the U.S. Geological Survey.
   ``It was the first significant tremor on the Hayward fault since
a 4.7 in 1984,'' she said.
   Police in Oakland, San Francisco and other communities said
there were no reports of damage or injuries.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.

   An earthquake was recorded Sunday morning off the
Pacific coast of northeastern Japan, the Central Meteorological
Agency said.
   An agency official said the quake, measuring 6.0 on the Richter
scale, occurred at 5:12 a.m. and was centered 93 miles off the
coast of Sanriku in Iwate prefecture. That is 340 miles northeast
of Tokyo.
   Police said there were no reports of casualties or damage. No
tidal waves were generated, the meteorological agency official said.
   There have been a series of quakes in the same general area
during the past several weeks. The largest one struck Thursday and
registered 7.3 on the Richter scale.
   More than 6,000 people were temporarily evacuated from coastal
towns because of fear of tidal waves from Thursday quake's but
there were no casualties or major damage.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an earthquake
and measured on seismographs. Each increase of one number means the
ground motion is 10 times greater.
   A quake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage in a populated
area. One registering 7 is capable of causing widespread and heavy
damage.

<HEAD>Rights Groups Denounce Slave-Like Conditions In Dominican Cane Fields</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three human rights groups in a
report released Saturday denounced what they called slave-like
working conditions of Haitian sugar-cane cutters in the Dominican
Republic.
   ``Although slavery in the Dominican Republic was formally
abolished over a century ago, Haitians in that country continue to
be delivered at gunpoint to work on government plantations,'' said
the report prepared in New York by Americas Watch, the National
Coalition of Haitian Refugees and Caribbean Rights.
   At least 500,000 Haitians live in the Dominican Republic, which
shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti.
   Many Haitians, unable to find work in their impoverished
country, cross the border to harvest the sugar cane in the
Dominican Republic. Most Dominicans refuse to do the work because
of the low pay.
   ``Haitian workers are compelled to labor under appalling
conditions for abysmal pay cutting cane on state-run sugar
plantations during the harvest season from November to May each
year,'' the report said.
   It said workers are lured from Haiti with promises of good pay,
and those already in the Dominican Republic are rounded up ``at
gunpoint'' and trucked to plantations.
   ``Uniformed, armed men patrol the plantations, both the
sugar-cane fields and areas where the Haitians live, to prevent
escape,'' the report said.
   The 70-page report claims the U.S. State Department's annual
human rights report ``systematically underestimated the coercive
practices against sugar-cane workers.''
   Americas Watch spokesman Kenneth Roth told The Associated Press
that the report was based on two fact-finding missions to the
Dominican Republic in April and June.

   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens on Saturday
praised the decision by Ethiopia to restore ties with Israel and
called it an opportunity to reunite Ethiopian Jewry with thousands
of members who emigrated to Israel.
   Arens also expressed hope that Ethiopia's step, announced
Friday, would lead the way for the resumption of ties with other
leftist African nations such as Angola, Mozambique and Zambia.
   ``As you know, the Arab world is doing everything it can to keep
African countries from resuming their diplomatic relations with
Israel,'' Arens told Israel radio. ``Ethiopia, nevertheless,
decided to renew their relations with us.''
   Twenty-eight African nations broke ties after Israel's 1973 war
with Egypt in response to a call for sanctions by the Organization
of African Unity. Ethiopia is the 10th African nation to restore
relations with the Jewish state since 1982.
   A spokesman for Ethiopia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the
``compelling reasons which dictated Ethiopia's severance of
diplomatic relations with Israel no longer exist.''
   The spokesman cited Israel's evacuation of Egyptian territory
occupied in the war and the restoration of ties between Egypt and
Israel.
   For Israel's 16,500-member Ethiopian community, the resumption
of ties between the two countries has raised the hope of reuniting
them with family members that want to join them.
   The chairman of the Public Council for Ethiopian Jews, Rahamim
Elazar, estimated 18,000 Jews wish to flee the African nation,
which has suffered from drought and civil war.
   Speaking on Israel radio, Elazar said he has been promised
immigration would receve top priority in Israel's new relations
with Addis Ababa.
   This month marks the fifth anniversary of the U.S.-assisted
``Operation Moses'' airlift that brought an estimated 8,000
Ethiopian Jews to Israel, where they joined earlier emigres.
   The operation was halted after news of it leaked out,
embarrassing the Marxist government in Addis Ababa, which had
traditionally been allied with Israel's enemies.
   ``I certainly think (diplomatic relations) will facilitate the
ability to deal directly with the government of Ethiopia to bring
out the remainder of Ethiopian Jewry to Israel,'' Arens said.
   However, five years after their dramatic exodus, almost 30
percent of those Ethiopians in Israel still live together in
crowded dormitory-style government housing centers.
   According to the National Council for Ethiopian Jews,
unemployment among Ethiopian immigrants above age 35 is about 45
percent.

   The heavy beat of rap music is resounding in
two neighborhoods near a powerful radio transmitter, with songs
like ``Wild Thing'' following some residents even into the bathroom.
   ``You can walk in my yard when it rains and hear the `rap, rap,
rap' music on the chain link fence,'' said Tanya Busko, a 27-year
resident of the affluent hillside community of Silver Lake, about
10 miles north of downtown Los Angeles.
   ``It's awful. It's unbelievable. At night it's unbearable,'' she
said.
   Residents of Silver Lake and adjacent Echo Park grumble that
KDAY-AM is too loud and even brags about the potency of its
50,000-watt signal. They cite promotional ads boasting that the
station's rap music is everywhere _ ``in cars, at the beach, in
living rooms, even in the shower.''
   KDAY President Edward J. Kerby said his station has broadcast
from its 3{-acre site for 24 years, focusing its signal toward
downtown with a narrow beam that keeps it from interfering with
other broadcasters.
   As a result, KDAY's rap music _ the format since 1982 _ can
sometimes be heard as far away as Hawaii and Japan.
   Ms. Busko says no room in her house is free from the signal.
   ``In the bathroom, you can hear it coming through the toilet
plumbing,'' she said. ``I can go in my bedroom, which has no
appliances or radio, and hear the rap music coming from the wiring
in the walls.''
   Kerby said inexpensive, low-quality household electronics
equipment act as makeshift radio receivers in residents' homes. He
said the volume of complaints, roughly 250 a year, prompted the
station to hire a technician to help mute unwanted signal reception.
   ``Over in the artsy Silver Lake area, every time somebody puts
in a new home recording studio I can count on losing my guy for two
or three days,'' Kerby said.
   Katherine Deaton, an official at the Federal Communications
Commission's Long Beach office, said KDAY has been checked for
illegal power boosting but none was found.
   ``KDAY is one of the best, in terms of cooperation,'' she said.
   Still, Pacific Bell officials said they are fielding increasing
complaints about rap music interference from telephone customers in
the two neighborhoods.
   ``On one of my phones, you can't hear the person you're talking
to because of it,'' Maria Noriega-Petti said. ``On the other, I can
put my hand on the phone and hear the music.''

   L. Douglas Wilder stumped the
mountain towns of southwest Virginia on Saturday for the votes to
become the nation's first elected black governor while his
Republican opponent stepped up attacks questioning Wilder's honesty.
   J. Marshall Coleman, who has trailed his Democratic opponent by
4 to 11 percentage points in recent polls, urged a black newspaper
to release a taped interview in which he claimed Wilder
contradicted his public support for the death penalty.
   Coleman also repeated his charge that Wilder pledged privately
to the United Mine Workers union to ``sabotage'' the state's
right-to-work law by allowing unions to assess dues on non-union
workers covered by union contracts, and then denied making the
promise.
   ``I think the question we need to ask today is what other secret
deals have been made,'' Coleman said.

   Wilder got a boost Saturday from the results of a new poll
showing him 9 percent ahead of Coleman. Wilder shared his delight
at an Abingdon rally over the findings of the Richmond
Times-Dispatch poll because the newspaper is one of the few in the
state that endorsed the GOP ticket.
   The poll in Sunday's editions showed Wilder was favored by 45
percent, Coleman had 36 percent and 19 percent had no preference.
The survey was based on interviews of 853 likely voters between
Oct. 27 and Nov. 1, and had a margin of error of 3 percentage
points.

   At a rally outside the Montgomery County courthouse in
Christianburg, housewife Marie Moran told Wilder she was going to
vote for Coleman until three days ago. She told reporters she had
supported Coleman because of his anti-abortion stance, but was
turned off by the Republican's suggestion that Wilder has received
favored treatment from the media because he is black.
   ``It's time for Virginia to have a black governor,'' Mrs. Moran
said.
   Wilder made a point of mentioning Mrs. Moran as he spoke at
rallies throughout the region.
   Wilder was joined by his Democratic running mates, Donald S.
Beyer Jr., who is seeking to become lieutenant governor, and
Attorney General Mary Sue Terry, who is running for re-election.
   Coleman campaigned in the Shenandoah Valley of northern Virginia.
   ``I am as confident as I could possibly be that we are on the
move,'' he told a rally in Winchester.
   Coleman was joined by U.S. Sen. John W. Warner, who held up
newspapers with front-page stories about President Bush's campaign
swing Friday with Coleman. Warner repeated what Bush told audiences
in Richmond and Norfolk _ ``It's important to have a friend in the
White House.''
   Flanked by Warner and HUD Secretary Jack Kemp at a later
appearance at Dulles International Airport in the Washington, D.C.,
suburb of Chantilly, Coleman reiterated that the race ``all comes
down to a question of trust.''
   State GOP Chairman Donald W. Huffman said the Richmond
Afro-American newspaper published a story in January quoting Wilder
as saying he opposed the death penalty. Wilder later denied making
the statement, but Huffman said the newspaper refused to release
its reporter's tape of the interview.
   ``It's a further act of desperation,'' Wilder said of the
Republicans' call for release of the tape.
   He reiterated his support of the state's death penalty law and
added that he did not recall the interview being tape recorded.
   Roxanne Wilkins, interim editor of the newspaper, said the
interview was recorded but she did not expect to release the tape.
``It's just a matter of ethics,'' she said.

   Armenian nationalists who spent much of
the year in jail won a political victory Saturday when their
republic's Communist Party chief offered to work with a new
political movement they organized.
   ``It's now high time for us to reunite,'' Armenian Communist
Party chief Suren Arutyunyan said to the cheers of 1,000 activists
who attended the founding conference of the Armenian All-National
Movement.
   The conference to create an organization similar to the People's
Front movements across the country was organized primarily by the
Karabakh Committee. The 11 committee members were arrested in
December and held without trial for up to six months for organizing
demonstrations and a general strike to support demands for transfer
of the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh from neighboring
Azerbaijan to Armenia.
   The committee has since been legalized, and Saturday it was
permitted use of Yerevan's Palace of Congresses to found a
coalition for about 10 pro-democracy organizations.
   It formally will adopt its program Sunday.
   Attitudes toward grass-roots political movements within the
Soviet Union have varied widely in the past year. Party leader in
the Baltic republics are working closely with their People's
Fronts, but officials in the Ukraine waged a media campaign against
them.
   Karabakh Committee member Ambartsum Galstyan said the Armenian
All-National Movement planned to work within the parliamentary
framework for democracy.
   ``We are following the Hungarian example,'' he said, referring
to the Soviet ally that has legalized opposition parties and seen
its Communist Party dissolve itself and reform as a social
democratic party.
   Galstyan said groups seeking Armenian independence were not
included in the new organization, ``because the republic is not
really ready for total independence. The economy is that of a
colonial country.''
   The new group wants to gain Armenian control over
Nagorno-Karabakh, a largely Christian Armenian enclave in primarily
Moslem Azerbaijan where they claim decades of discrimination. The
territorial dispute has been the focus of 21 months of ethnic
violence in which about 120 people have been killed.
   The Armenian All-National Movement's draft program also calls
for a new treaty with the Soviet Union, greater freedom of religion
for the Armenian Orthodox Church, restoration of Armenian holidays
and the right of farmers to hold their own land and pass it on to
their children.
   It said only laws ratified by the Armenian legislature should be
valid in Armenia.

   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner
announced a pact with Japan Saturday that he said marked the ``most
dramatic expansion in air service between the two countries'' in 37
years.
   ``It opens new vistas in terms of travel, trade and tourism,''
Skinner said late Saturday after the agreement had been signed in
Tokyo at 5:30 a.m. Sunday, Tokyo time. Transportation Department
officials announced the ``agreement in principle'' in Washington.
   David Prosperi, assistant secretary for public affairs, said the
pact could increase current air service between the United States
and Japan by 25 to 30 percent. Six U.S. and three Japanese carriers
currently service routes between the two countries.
   Prosperi said U.S. and Japanese officials initialled the
agreement after six days of negotiations in Tokyo.
   Skinner said the pact would provide substantial new
opportunities for both scheduled and charter passenger and cargo
service across the Pacific.
   ``This agreement represents the most dramatic expansion of air
service to Japan since the original bilateral agreement was signed
in 1952,'' Skinner said.
   The pact provides more passenger and cargo service between the
two countries, new all-cargo services and special services for
Alaska, Guam and Saipan, Prosperi said.
   All international air routes are worked out in bilateral
negotiations between countries. The routes, the frequency of
flights and the stopover cities where passengers can be picked up
are among the items determined by these agreements.
   Air service between the United States and Japan has increased
through bilateral agreements over the years. Transportation
officials said the latest agreement was more far reaching than any
of the previous pacts.
   Specific provisions described by Prosperi include:
   _The pact could add direct combination passenger and cargo
service from up to six U.S. cities to Japan by U.S. airlines,
depending on what cities airlines apply to serve. Three of the
services would be to Japanese cities other than Tokyo or Osaka.
   _Japanese airlines will be able to add one-stop service to three
U.S. cities they do not now serve, and Japan Air Lines will
increase its Tokyo-Seattle-Chicago flights from five to seven per
week.
   _Any combination passenger and cargo flight from airlines of
either country can serve Alaska and additional service will be
added between Alaska and a Japanese city other than Tokyo or Osaka.
   _One additional U.S. all-cargo airline will serve Japan.
   _The quota of charter flights from the United States to Japan
will be increased immediately from 300 to 400 annually and to 450
next year. Many charter flights are used to haul cargo.
   _Japanese airlines will be authorized to operate up to eight new
all-cargo flights per week to Chicago, and the Japanese all-cargo
service NCA will serve Chicago and Los Angeles for the first time.
   _New routes from Guam and Saipan will permit additional U.S.
airline carrier service to Nagoya, Fukuoka and Okinawa, Japan, and
other new flights may be added to any two Japanese cities not now
served by U.S. airlines.

<TEXT>
   Voters endorsed legalized gambling in
hotel-casino resorts in balloting Saturday in this economically
depressed steel town.
   Voters supported gambling by 13,309 votes, or 60.4 percent, to
8,733 votes, or 39.6 percent, against. Only 32.3 percent of the
registered voters cast ballots on the non-binding referendum.
   Despite the results, Gov. Evan Bayh said late Saturday that he
will not support gambling in Gary.
   ``The results of the referendum are of course important, but
with such a low turnout, I don't find them to be compelling,'' Bayh
said in Indianapolis.
   Mayor Thomas V. Barnes, a casino supporter, said he believes the
vote is the beginning of an economic resurgence in the town beset
by high unemployment.
   ``I sincerely believe you have said yes to Gary, Indiana, yes to
our confidence in ourselves, yes to our courage in facing the
future and certainly yes to your confidence in your officials,''
said Barnes.
   State legislators from Gary had promised to bring the issue to
the 1990 session of the General Assembly if the referendum passed.
   Rep. Earline Rogers of Gary said the results send a clear
message to the Legislature. ``Today is not the end of a campaign,
today is the beginning of a campaign,'' said Rogers.
   Barnes and other casino advocates argue that gambling could turn
around the fortunes of Gary, which fell on hard times after massive
layoffs in the steel industry in the early 1980s.
   Opponents contend that casinos would bring more street crime and
prostitution, attract organized crime and disrupt neighborhoods.
   ``I'm not convinced casino gambling is the magic wand. I think
most of the job opportunites won't go to Gary residents,'' said
Bayh.
   Barnes and casino opponents said the unusual voting date _ the
first Saturday ballot in city history _ and a reduction in polling
places to 18 from the normal 159 had hurt the turnout.
   But Barnes maintained that a majority vote no matter what the
turnout should be viewed as a clear endorsement of casino gambling.

   The General Assembly ordered the referendum as a compromise
after legislators narrowly defeated a measure to approve casinos
outright in Gary.
   A legislative study committee, made up principally of Gary-area
legislators, held hearings this summer and recommended that the
Assembly approve casino gambling if Gary citizens endorse the idea.
   Casino industry officials told the committee that Gary, located
within a half-hour of Chicago and within a day's drive of 30
million people, could support five hotel-casinos.
   The industry estimates 10,000 construction jobs and 27,500
casino-related jobs could be created in a city where the
unemployment rate in recent years has been twice the state and
national averages.
   The city has lost 30,000 steel industry jobs since 1979, the
committee was told, and the population of Gary has fallen from
151,000 in 1980 to 136,000. Basic city services became erratic, and
the police and fire departments were cut from 400 members each to
200.
   But casino opponents, including ministers of several
predominantly black churches in the city, argued Gary could wind up
like Atlantic City, N.J., where a lot of casino jobs went to
outsiders and unemployment remained high.
   Other opponents urged the city to pursue more traditional
development such as trying to win a third major Chicago-area
airport for the city and building a lakefront marina.

   Fiorello La Guardia's granddaughter stood up at
an Italian-American political breakfast one day last week and named
her choice _ her whole family's choice, she said _ for mayor.
   It was not Rudolph Giuliani.
   For Giuliani, who has styled himself as La Guardia's political
progeny, ``The psychic blow had to be enormous,'' Republican
political strategist Jay Severin III said later.
   Katherine La Guardia's choice was Democrat David Dinkins, the
longtime front-runner. She said Giuliani, a Republican, had made
``improper comparisons'' between himself and her grandfather, a
Republican mayor from 1934-45.
   Her pick, Severin half-joked, capped ``a series of prophecies''
against Giuliani's campaign. Last summer, President Bush failed to
pronounce his name correctly. Last month, a dinner program listed
him as ``Randolph'' Giuliani. At a campaign stop Thursday, a
seagull insulted his suit.
   If these were lightly called omens, opinion polls provided a
more ominous message for Giuliani. With New York poised to elect
its next mayor Tuesday, the pale ex-prosecutor has yet to strike a
spark with most voters.
   ``Giuliani has made some fundamental strategic mistakes,'' said
John Mollenkopf, political science professor at the Graduate Center
of the City University of New York. ``He should have projected a
more positive image.''
   Instead, Giuliani, 45, in his first run for elective office,
conducted what Mollenkopf called a ``cut-and-slash'' campaign,
attacking Dinkins' competence and character in increasingly
strident tones.
   Giuliani kept up the attack Saturday night, alleging in a debate
that Dinkins was involved in ``a coverup'' by not releasing details
of a stock sale to his son and criticizing the Democrat for failing
to pay his taxes on time for four years, 20 years ago.
   ``People usually don't run for mayor in the city of New York who
didn't pay their taxes for four years,'' Giuliani said.
   Dinkins countered by saying the former U.S. attorney had no
experience in government and had reversed himself by first opposing
and then supporting public funding for abortion.
   ``What we need is not a prosecutor, but a mayor,'' Dinkins said.
   The flaw in Giuliani's strategy, analysts said, has been his
failure to establish himself as an alternative. When Dinkins'
support slid amid questions about his finances two weeks ago, it
moved to the undecided column rather than to Giuliani's.
   ``Rudy gave people a lot of reasons to vote against Dinkins,''
said Severin, who has not played a role in the campaign. ``But in
the end there wasn't enough time or money to give them reasons to
vote for Giuliani.''
   Dinkins, 62, has recovered solidly from a dive in the polls. He
successfully defended the stock sale to his son at a news
conference, admitted a pair of faulty votes and cut ties with two
campaign aides accused of anti-Semitism.
   A poll released Saturday showed Dinkins leading Giuliani among
likely voters 54 percent to 38 percent. The poll, conducted for
WABC-TV and the Daily News, had a margin of error of 5{ percentage
points.
   Above all, Dinkins has drawn the election as a choice of
political parties, castigating Republican-inspired cuts in urban
programs while recruiting prominent Democrats to campaign or
advertise for him.
   With Democrats outnumbering Republicans by 5-to-1, ``Converting
the contest between David Dinkins and Rudy Giuliani to a contest
between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party may have
succeeded,'' said Raymond Harding, a chief Giuliani adviser. ``The
hegemony of the Democratic Party is so great.''
   Dinkins has other artillery, and chief among it is the support
of most city unions. The Central Labor Council of the AFL-CIO says
it will have 6,700 volunteers on the street Tuesday urging Dinkins
voters to the polls.
   ``They have a veritable army,'' conceded Harding. ``Our side
cannot compete with that.'' He said the union pull could be worth 2
or 3 percentage points for Dinkins; others say more.
   One hope for Giuliani is the ``lying factor,'' Harding said _
the possibility that some white voters may have been untruthful
when the told pollsters they will vote for Dinkins, who is seeking
to become the city's first black mayor. He also said a good showing
in weekend debates, finally scheduled at the last minute after
weeks of wrangling over details, could provide a boost.
   Dinkins has focused on more specific goals, concentrating in
large part on shoring up his support among Jewish voters. Some Jews
are wary of his friendship with Jesse Jackson, who supports
Palestinian self-determination.
   Still, Mollenkopf, a specialist in city voting patterns, said it
would be an overstatement to single out Jews as a swing group,
because Dinkins could lose half the Jewish vote and still win the
election handily.

   Drug agents discovered an estimated 5{ tons of
cocaine buried beneath a toxic chemical inside hundreds of
10-gallon drums marked poison, authorities said Saturday.
   The find, which followed a three-month investigation, occurred
at about 9 p.m. Friday in a two-story warehouse in the borough of
Queens, said Capt. James Rogers of the city Fire Department's
hazardous materials division.
   There were no arrests made as of early Saturday afternoon,
authorities said.
   Drug Enforcement Administration regional head Robert Stutman, in
a Saturday news conference at the warehouse, said the massive
seizure indicated just how much cocaine is being shipped into the
country. His agency, along with U.S. Customs, was involved in the
raid.
   ``You don't have to be a brain surgeon to figure out that we're
being flooded with cocaine,'' said Stutman. ``Certainly in New
York, we have not seen any lessening of availability.''
   Authorities estimate there were 11,000 pounds of cocaine, or 5{
tons. When 21.4 tons of cocaine was seized in September in Los
Angeles, authorities there gave its street value at up to $1
billion per ton. However, DEA spokeswoman Mary Cooper said each ton
of cocaine has a street value of $160 million.
   As of late Saturday, 8,800 pounds of cocaine had been retrieved
from about two-thirds of the barrels.
   An anonymous tip led the DEA and Customs to investigate whether
the warehouse was being used by a ring associated with the Cali
cartel in Colombia, Customs agent Richard Mercier said.
   The cocaine had been shipped from Panama to Philadelphia about a
week ago and then was trucked to the warehouse, Mercier told The
New York Times.
   The drug agents called fire department hazardous waste
specialists when they discovered the drums also contained sodium
hydroxide, a caustic powder which can burn skin and damage lungs,
Rogers said. The cocaine was in plastic-wrapped bricks and the
caustic substance was then poured in around it.
   Firefighters opening drums at random found cocaine inside each
one, and the warehouse held 252 drums. Each container held about 15
kilos _ roughly 33 pounds _ of cocaine, Rogers said.
   ``They figure nobody's going to look inside chemicals because
when you open the drums, you expose yourself to toxic effects,''
said Rogers. ``It's like breathing ammonia.''
   Carol Boyd Hallett, who was sworn in as U.S. Customs
commissioner just hours before Friday's seizure, said the New York
cache _ combined with raids which netted more than 36 tons of
cocaine last month _ show the drug war can be won.
   ``There should be no doubt that our combined efforts are paying
off,'' said a statement issued by Hallett in Washington. ``We are
hurting the drug barons and we're not going to let up.''
   In addition to the seizure in Los Angeles, authorities last
month seized 9 tons from a home in Harlingen, Texas, and 6 tons
from a ship in the Gulf of Mexico.

   President Bush is hoping his late
appearances in Virginia and New Jersey boost the Republican Party's
uphill candidacies for governor and urge more GOP voters to the
polls next Tuesday.
   Bush was on the stump trying to pump up Republican activists,
but he stayed clear of the volatile abortion issue that has been
prominent in both governor's races.
   Pro-choice activists, waving signs and chanting, ``Pro-choice,
pro-choice,'' showed up at Bush's outdoor rallies in both Richmond,
Va., and Bloomfield, N.J., on Friday.
   Bush's New Jersey stop was for a rally aimed at boosting turnout
for the critical state legislative races and helping Rep. James
Courter in his faltering governor's race against Democratic Rep.
James Florio.
   Bush and and Courter did not mention abortion. Nor did GOP
gubernatorial candidate J. Marshall Coleman in Virginia, where Bush
campaigned earlier Friday.

   The Virginia governor's race could make
history if L. Douglas Wilder becomes the nation's first elected
black governor, but the contest already has set records for
spending.
   Campaign reports filed by the candidates last week showed
Wilder, the Democratic lieutenant governor, has raised $6.46
million. Republican J. Marshall Coleman, a former attorney general,
has gathered $8.05 million.
   Added to the $7.3 million spent by the two losers in the June
GOP primary, total spending for the election should top $22 million.
   That would make the race the most expensive in Virginia history,
exceeded nationally only by past races in Texas ($33.1 million),
Florida ($24 million) and California ($22.5 million). All are at
least twice as populous as Virginia, which has more than 5 million
people.

   President Bush's support of a pay raise for
top government officials and members of Congress returns it to the
forefront just eight months after lawmakers were scorched by public
backlash on the issue.
   House leaders have been busy behind the scenes trying to arrange
a pay increase coupled with ethics reforms, hoping to get it
accomplished this year before lawmakers become too wary with
re-election concerns.
   Bush's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said Friday that the
president would support any ``reasonable proposal.''
   One congressional source, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the latest version included an 8 percent ``cost-of-living''
raise in January for members of Congress and senior officials in
the other two government branches.

   Veterans Secretary Edward J. Derwinski will
have to decide without the guidance he was looking for from an
advisory panel whether to award benefits to some Vietnam veterans
exposed to Agent Orange.
   Derwinski is expected to make the decision around Thanksgiving
as the result of court-ordered regulations for determining the
relationship between exposure to the herbicide exposure and cancer.
   Nearly 12,000 disability claims once denied by the VA are now
pending as a result of a court order issued in May by U.S. District
Judge Thelton E. Henderson in San Francisco.
   Derwinski was looking for the Environmental Hazards Advisory
Committee, made up largely of scientists, to clear up some of the
arguments over Agent Orange. But the panel, in its first ruling on
Agent Orange, acknowledged Friday that it couldn't come up with a
definite conclusion.

<HEAD>Pile of Pork Bellies Headed for Eastern Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A shipment of frozen pork bellies may lack the golden symbolism
of a boatload of wheat but that's of little concern to the hungry
Eastern European nations that have suddenly become hot markets for
the cold commodity.
   U.S. pork bellies are headed for Poland and Yugoslavia, and the
Soviet Union has also signaled interest in the meat, which is the
part of a hog from which bacon is made.
   The surge of foreign demand stems from a shortage of pork in
Europe and is a welcome surprise to U.S. pork producers, who
watched pork-belly prices plunge to 18-year lows earlier this year
as supplies approached record highs.
   The market reversed its downward course in August. Prices soared
to new highs for the year this past week.
   Frozen pork bellies for delivery in February settled Friday at
59.60 cents a pound compared to 51.85 cents a week earlier and
38.30 cents on Aug. 9, when the price slide ended.
   Pork bellies have rarely been exported in the past and the
international demand has ``given the market a whole new
dimension,'' said Charles Levitt, an analyst with Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. in Chicago.
   The climb back from the August lows began when the National Pork
Producers Council and the American Meat Institute started lobbying
the Bush administration to include pork bellies in a planned
package of U.S. food aid to the newly democratized Polish
government, according to Charles Harness, a spokesman for the Des
Moines, Iowa-based pork group.
   Early in September, the Polish government put in a request for
50,000 metric tons of U.S. bellies. The ensuing negotiations led to
the signing Friday of an agreement to include up to 10,000 tons of
bellies in the Polish food aid package.
   Separately, a Yugoslavian-owned exporting company in New York,
Impex Overseas Corp., confirmed this past week that it recently
bought nearly 150,000 tons of pork bellies to be shipped to
Yugoslavia this month.
   ``Traditionally, pork has always been bought from European
countries,'' said Sanjin Fabris, traffic manager for Impex. ``But
at the moment there's a big shortage of this product and any pork
product in Europe.''
   The Yugoslavians may buy more U.S. bellies if they are satisfied
with the first shipment and prices retreat from this week's high
levels, he said.
   On Thursday came news that Soviet trade officials had approached
the United States wanting to buy pork bellies and other meats.
   But experts say it could take several months to remove trade
barriers and allow the Soviets to buy U.S. bellies.
   The surge in pork-belly prices helped lift hog futures prices on
the Chicago Merc. Cattle futures were little changed in the past
week.

<HEAD>Americans Are Aggressively Buying Overseas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Japanese will own 51 percent of the
Christmas tree in Rockefeller Center this winter, 51 percent of
Radio City Music Hall and 51 percent of the Art Deco skyscraper
where Tom Brokaw and David Letterman work.
   The $846 million investment in Rockefeller Group Inc. this past
week by Mitsubishi Estate Co. provoked a fresh spate of headlines
about how foreigners, Japanese in particular, were buying up
America.
   The headlines were understandable. The deal involved the first
family of American capitalism as well as a major tourist and media
center. It came a month after Sony Corp.'s agreement to buy another
cultural symbol, Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.
   What was often missed, though, is that while the Japanese are
buying in the United States, Americans are buying overseas as well.
A case in point is Ford Motor Co.'s agreement this past week to buy
the British luxury automaker Jaguar PLC for $2.5 billion.
   The Japanese have more capacity to invest abroad because of
their towering trade surpluses, but the Americans are making
certain not to lose out in the global acquisition game.
   Most U.S. overseas purchases scarcely make news. Few noticed
this past week when Totes Inc. of Ohio bought a West German
umbrella distributor and renamed it Totes Deutschland. Or when
International Business Machines Corp. bought one-fifth of a Dutch
software company, Delaware Computing, from its Belgian parent.
   But despite the lack of publicity back home, Americans were the
biggest cross-border buyer of companies in Europe in the first half
of 1989, according to British-American Deal Review.
   ``When Americans fear that their landmark real estate and their
top corporations are being consumed by foreign predators, they must
remember that at the very same time America is the largest acquirer
in Europe,'' said Mark Dixon, the review's editor.
   The truth is that companies in all the major industrialized
nations are investing overseas, hoping to establish beachheads in
each other's markets and transform themselves into global
competitors.
   Ford, for example, already is much more entrenched in Europe
than Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. or Toyota Motor Corp. is in the United
States. IBM is so well planted in foreign markets that it is
perceived as a local company.
   ``This is not something that started today or this week or last
week. The most dynamic element of international economic
transactions over the past decade or two decades has been foreign
direct investment,'' said Peter Hansen, executive director of the
United Nations' Center on Transnational Corporations.
   The foreign investment that some Americans fear is a problem
that most Third World nations would love to have. They can't get
foreign money to build essential factories, roads and bridges.
   Flows of direct foreign investment ``are concentrated in
developed countries more than ever before,'' the United Nations
center said in a report earlier this year.
   As cross-border investment continues to grow in the 1990s,
nations will pay more attention to whether the investment they get
is productive or unproductive. Unfortunately, channeling foreign
money to desirable recipients won't be easy.
   ``It doesn't really work, because companies, even in sectors
which are being welcomed and encouraged, are frightened that the
winds will change and they'll be put on the blacklist,'' said
Dixon, the editor of British-American Deal Review.
   Maybe so. In any case, the level of debate over cross-border
investment is bound to get more sophisticated. People will worry
less about who owns Christmas trees and music halls, and more about
what improves the national welfare.
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _Senate Republicans effectively abandoned efforts to win a
capital-gains tax cut this year. It was a victory for the Democrats
and a defeat for President Bush, who just weeks ago seemed on the
verge of meeting a tax-cut promise that had been part of his
campaign for the presidency.
   _The New York Stock Exchange announced fresh limits on
computerized program trading in response to a wave of complaints
that the strategy contributes to wild swings in stock prices.
Several major brokerage firms announced voluntary limits on the use
of program trading for themselves and customers.
   _Georgia-Pacific Corp. offered $3.3 billion for another paper
company, Great Northern Nekoosa Corp., in the first major takeover
offer since the collapse of a $6.75 billion bid for UAL Corp. by
employees and management. Separately, an investment group led by
Coniston Partners said it would attempt to take over the UAL board
of directors to force a sale or restructuring of the company.

   Among its many other afflictions, Wall Street
lately has come down with a new and acute case of cyberphobia.
   The term, defined simply as the fear of computers, was coined
decades ago when scientists first began to experiment with
electronic methods of handling information and conducting business.
   Now it is focusing on the computer-driven tactics, such as
multiple transactions involving stock-index futures and individual
stocks, that are collectively known as program trading, and are
feared to be threatening severe harm to the integrity of the
markets.
   The latest outcry began in last month's ``Friday the 13th
massacre'' when the Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 190
points.
   The market was perceived to be at the mercy of mindless
computer-generated transactions, governed only by a few flimsy,
untested safeguards adopted since the Crash of 1987.
   ``This is insanity,'' said Raymond F. DeVoe Jr. in a commentary
for Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc. ``The stock exchange has become a
casino for `players,' with everyone else taking it on the chin.''
   Or as Jay Donnaruma at First Albany Corp. in Albany, N.Y., put
it: ``Some kind of compromise should be reached before there is
nothing left but computers trading with other computers.''
   Actually, most critics of the new trading techniques protest
that they aren't cyberphobes at all. It's not the use of computers
they object to, they say, but the abuse of new systems for purposes
never intended in the markets.
   And besides, they say, you don't call it a phobia when the
danger you fear is real.
   ``We are not waxing nostalgic for the good old days,'' DeVoe
declared. ``But something is terribly wrong. The capital and stock
markets used by a small number of players are being ruined for
everyone else.''
   While those issues were debated, stock prices managed to cut
their October losses a bit in the past week. The Dow Jones average
of 30 industrials closed Friday at 2,629.51, up 32.79 from the week
before.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.68 to 187.28;
the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market gained
0.64 to 452.97, and the American Stock Exchange market value index
was up 1.78 at 371.79.
   Average volume on the Big Board came to 148.18 million shares a
day, against 175.01 million the week before.
   The question of whether computers ought to play some role in
stock trading seems to have been settled for good. Without the
capacity they provided to process all types of orders, everybody
agrees, the markets would surely have been overwhelmed on Black
Monday in 1987 or in this year's selloff.
   Furthermore, the idea of outlawing program trading is nowhere
near as simple as, say, banning speeding on a highway or smoking in
a restaurant.
   Stock-index arbitrage is a broad and flexible strategy that
could, at least in theory, be carried out in a lot of other places
in the world if it weren't permitted in U.S. markets. If index
futures were outlawed, substitutes to serve the same purpose might
quickly appear.
   Faced with such obstacles, opponents of program trading have
turned of late, with some apparent success, to political pressure
and moral suasion.
   Money managers at a few investing institutions have withdrawn,
or threatened to withdraw, their business from brokers that engage
in program activity.
   A few corporate executives have pressured officials in the
markets where their stocks are traded to restrict the practice.
   Many brokerage firms have responded by vowing to swear off or at
least cut down on program activity. Late last week the NYSE
announced a series of measures designed to restrain its impact.
   Meanwhile, it was all too easy to imagine an innovator working
somewhere on Wall Street on a new, high-tech trading system for the
1990s that might settle the issue of program trading by rendering
it obsolete.
