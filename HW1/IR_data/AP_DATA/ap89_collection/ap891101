<HEAD>Japan's Governing Party Reports on Donations from Pinball Industry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The governing party said Thursday that it and 52 of
its members received more than $800,000 in donations from the
pinball industry, at the center of Japan's latest scandal over
alleged influence-buying efforts.
   Donations by the industry, known as pachinko, have been the
subject of two days of debate in Parliament this week.
   The governing Liberal Democratic Party first took up published
allegations that legislators of the opposition Socialist Party used
their influence to fight efforts to tighten regulations on the
industry after receiving such donations.
   Police say the industry is a major tax-evader.
   Questions also were raised as to whether such donations violate
laws against political donations by foreigners and may have
security implications.
   Many pachinko parlor owners are Korean residents of Japan, and
an estimated 30 percent have links to Communist North Korea.
   The Socialist Party maintains close ties with the North. The
government recognizes only North Korea's capitalist rival, South
Korea.
   The pro-North Korean residents association denied making any
political donations in Japan.
   Seiji Ozawa, the Liberal Democrats' secretary-general, has
reported 52 party members received a total of $553,000 from an
association of pachinko parlor operators, said a party spokesman on
condition of anonymity.
   Ozawa also said the party itself received about $278,000 from
the association from 1972 to 1989, the spokesman added.
   Ozawa said former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita received
$12,500, former Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda received just under
$7,000 and former Chief Cabinet Secretary Masaru Gotoda $34,700.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and seven other Cabinet members
accepted $34,500 from pinball parlor owners, Ozawa said. He said he
did not include them in his list because they already publicly
announced receipt of these donations.
   The Socialists said earlier their investigation showed that
party members had received $56,000 in donations from the pinball
industry.
   Socialist Secretary-General Tsuro Yamaguchi said party officials
``found no trace of wrongdoing'' in the case.
   The Socialists urged disclosure of pinball industry donations to
the Liberal Democrats.
   The governing party was shaken earlier by sex and money
scandals. The scandals along with an unpopular sales tax led, in
elections in July, to the party's losing its majority in
Parliament's upper house for the first time in its 34-year history.
Party support has been recovering in recent public opinion polls,
however.
   In one scandal, the Recruit Co., an information and publishing
conglomerate, was accused of trying to buy influence among
prominent politicians and bureaucrats with donations and cut-price
stock sales.

   President Bush will begin giving occasional
interviews to radio reporters, the White House said Wednesday.
   Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said Bush intends
to give the radio interviews on Friday afternoons. It will be ``not
every week, but occasionally,'' he added.
   The interviews will be with radio reporters who regularly cover
the White House, Fitzwater said.
   Bush has given numerous one-on-one interviews with newspapers in
his first 10 months in office, but had not made a habit of granting
radio interviews.
   Former President Reagan, a one-time broadcaster, broadcast
weekly Saturday radio talks, but Bush never copied that practice.
   Fitzwater said the interviews would be with individual radio
correspondents and ``will be exclusive to the radio receiving the
interview, just as any other interview.''
   He said the first one is not scheduled, but Bush did give an
interview Wednesday to Hal Bruno for the ABC radio network.
   Broadcast times for the interviews would be up to the outlets
participating, Fitzwater said.

<HEAD>EPA Tightens Controls on Radioactive Releases</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 7th graf: ``Under the,'' to remove extraneous material</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency tightened
controls Wednesday on radioactive releases from hospitals, nuclear
power plants and other facilities, although officials said in many
cases the tougher standards already are being met.
   The new regulations were issued 10 years after the federal Clean
Air Act called on the agency to establish emission standards for
radioactive byproducts. Such releases already are controlled by the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
   William Rosenberg, the EPA's assistant adminstrator for air and
radiation, said the long delay in the regulations reflects the
difficulties the agency faces in reducing hazardous releases under
current federal air quality laws.
   He said some changes would shorten the process by years, such as
the proposal by President Bush to no longer require the EPA to make
risk assessment for each type of release and, instead, establish
broader requirements for industries to use the ``best available''
pollution control technology.
   So far the EPA has only established regulations for eight of the
hundreds of toxic or carcinogenic chemicals released into the air
by industry and other sources.
   The new regulations on radionuclide emissions cover nearly 7,000
facilities _ most of then hospitals, laboratories, research
facilities, atomic power plants, and uranium mines or processing
plants _ where atomic materials are used causing radioactive
byproducts to be released into the air.
   Under the new standards, the EPA aims at reducing the lifetime
risk of cancer faced by the ``most exposed'' individuals to one in
10,000. These are people who live 70 years adjacent to the
installations in question.
   Many facilities such as nuclear power plants and hospitals
already meet such stanards but some do not, the agency said.
   Richard Guimond, director of the EPA's office of radiation,
estimated that currently as many as 10,000 people may live in areas
where they are exposed to a higher than 1-in-10,000 risk level.
Under the new regulations that number would be cut to fewer than
1,000 people.
   Some environmentalists have argued the EPA should use a risk
level of 1 in 1 million even for those living close to such
facilities, but Rosenberg said such a standard would be
counterproductive since it likely would cause significant
restrictions in the use of radioactive therapy that is aimed at
saving lives.
   Guimond said the regulations likely would require no changes,
other than perhaps in record keeping, at most of the facilities _
especially hospitals, power plants and medical laboratories _
because they already meet the tighter risk standards.
   But other facilities have risk levels _ as much as 6 in 10,000
at some phosphorous plants, for example _ that will require tighter
controls on emissions to meet the new standard, he said.
   According to the EPA, tigher controls to curb radioactive
releases likely will be required at:
   _Seven of the country's 15 underground uranium mines at a cost
to the industry of $400,000 a year. As many as five of the mines
may choose instead to shut down, officials said.
   _A number of Energy Department sites where excessive radon is
released from radioactive wastes, some dating back to the early
days of the nuclear program in the 1940s and 1950s.
   _Some of the country's five operating elemental phosphorous
plants where health risks to nearby residents exceed EPA standards.
A phosphorous plant in Pocatello, Idaho likely will have to install
a $2.4 million scrubber to reduce emissions because radioactive
pollution there poses an estimated cancer risk 12 times as greater
as the 1-in-10,000 standard allows, according to the EPA.

   Ten years ago, the Iran hostage crisis
transfixed two nations and alarmed the world. An AP correspondent
who helped cover the international drama has revisited the scene.
Here is a report.

<DATELINE>TEHRAN, Iran (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leader of the Iranian militants who
stormed the U.S. Embassy in 1979, a man who now holds a seat in
Tehran's Parliament, says the seizure of American hostages a decade
ago helped save the Islamic revolution.
   The still-ardent revolutionary, Mohammad Ibrahim Azgharzadeh,
also insists that even today there can be no accommodation with
America.
   ``In the light of the very nature of the United States, the role
Washington plays in guiding anti-revolutionary elements and its
anti-Islamic stand, there's no possibility of considering the
resumption of diplomatic relations,'' Azgharzadeh said.
   The Tehran embassy was overrun on Nov. 4, 1979. Many embassy
personnel were soon freed, but 52 diplomats and other staff members
were held hostage for 444 days, accused of operating a ``den of
spies.'' They were finally released Jan. 20, 1981, the day Jimmy
Carter left the U.S. presidency and Ronald Reagan was sworn in.
   The crisis was resolved when the United States pledged not to
interfere in Iran's internal affairs and the two countries
established a framework for settling billions of dollars in claims
against each other. Washington severed formal relations with Iran
during the crisis, and they have not been resumed.
   The bearded Azgharzadeh, bespectacled and intense, is as
anti-American now as he was in the chaotic early days of the
revolution.
   ``If the so-called embassy had not been seized and the
Americans' spying activities stopped, the revolution would have
been in danger,'' he told The Associated Press in an interview.
   Azgharzadeh, 34, one of 270 members of the Majlis, Iran's
parliament, said the embassy takeover was carefully planned,
``taking into account all the possible consequences.''
   One of these ``consequences'' was to bring down Iran's first
revolutionary government, headed by a liberal prime minister, Mehdi
Bazargan, because of what Azgharzadeh said was its alleged secret
dealings with Washington.
   ``We knew that the capture of the embassy would result in the
fall of the interim government and we had information about the
secret dealings between the two,'' he added.
   A week before the embassy seizure, Bazargan had met with
Carter's national security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, in
Algeria. Two days after the hostage seizure in Tehran, Bazargan
resigned.
   Azgharzadeh said the Bazargan government had refused to take any
action against the United States ``and this was against the views
of the leader of the revolution,'' Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who
branded the United States the ``Great Satan'' for supporting Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's regime, brought down in February 1979.
   ``Three of us planned the seizure of the embassy because we were
convinced that the mission was doing things other than conducting
normal diplomatic activities,'' Azgharzadeh said.
   He did not name the other organizers. But several leaders of the
embassy militants have, like Azgharzadeh, risen to positions of
power and influence in the past decade.
   Among them are Hussein Sheikholeslam, now a deputy foreign
minister and a key radical. Another is a middle-ranking cleric,
Hojatoleslam Mohammad Musavi Khoeiniha, who was prosecutor-general
until he was dropped by President Hashemi Rafsanjani after his
election last July.
   The former embassy compound, covering a city block and sealed
off to most Iranians and all foreigners, is now a school for Iran's
Revolutionary Guards Corps.
   Young guards with close-cropped black beards, symbol of
revolutionary manhood, and armed with automatic weapons stare down
stonily from elevated sentry boxes atop the embassy's perimeter
wall along Talaghani Avenue in central Tehran.
   The walls are daubed with slogans in foot-high letters. One
reads, ``We will make America face a severe defeat.'' Another, ``If
God wills, this century will be the period of victory of the
oppressed of the world over the oppressors.''
   Officials decline to say what goes on behind the high walls of
the sprawling compound, which housed the embassy, living quarters
for diplomats and a pine-studded park.
   But a cloth banner strung above the iron gates of the main
entrance advertise classes in martial arts _ karate and taekwondo _
``open to all who register.''
   Ten years ago, the embassy was besieged every day by thousands
of Iranians chanting support for Khomeini and fired up by
anti-American speeches.
   These days it is much more tranquil. But that could be shattered
Saturday, 10th anniversary of the takeover. Radicals have called
for anti-American protests, although the government has not
officially scheduled demonstrations.
   Officials have also said that some of the scores of Iranians
arrested earlier this year as alleged U.S. spies will publicly
confess in Tehran on Sunday, probably inflaming anti-U.S. passions
at a time when Rafsanjani, leader of Tehran's ``pragmatists,'' is
believed to be seeking to end Iran's political isolation.

   A man depicted as a good Samaritan after
the San Francisco earthquake actually stole traffic flares from
legitimate volunteers and provoked his own shooting death, a police
official said Wednesday.
   Some news reports wrongly portrayed DeSoto Barker, a 24-year-old
former Mississippian, as a volunteer who helped police direct
traffic but was shot to death by a passing motorist upset by the
chaos, said police Inspector Michael Byrne of San Francisco.
   ``This is not a good Samaritan case,'' Byrne said in a telephone
interview.
   The Salvation Army gave the initial favorable account of
Barker's actions. But several witnesses have given a much different
version of the events leading to his death within an hour of the
Oct. 17 quake, Byrne said.
   The inspector said Barker and others apparently stole flares
from police and legitimate volunteers directing traffic on a
highway a few blocks from his home.
   Witnesses said that at one point, Barker used flares to stop
traffic so he could cross a busy street to his home, Byrne said.
   ``As he was crossing the street, he caused a motorcycle to
swerve out of his way,'' the inspector said. A neighbor,
28-year-old William Carter, criticized Barker.
   After calling each other names, ``Mr. Carter challenged Mr.
Barker to fight,'' Byrne said. Witnesses said Barker threatened to
kill Carter as he headed home.
   Barker returned five minutes later and Carter, fearing that
Barker would hurt him because Barker had been armed with a gun,
shot him, Byrne said.
   About two hours later, Carter surrendered to police. He has been
charged with murder, Byrne said.
   Barker's mother and other family members live in Jonestown in
northwest Mississippi. His body was returned there last week with
the help of the Salvation Army.

   Philadelphia Orchestra violinist Paul Arnold
wasn't impressed when he first saw the hit TV sitcom ``The Wonder
Years.'' Then he noticed his resemblance to the star's nebbishy
friend.
   ``I started watching this show about kids, and I really wasn't
too interested, but the longer I watched, the more the names and
situations became very familiar,'' Arnold said this week, recalling
seeing the premiere episode of the ABC-TV show last year.
   ``Suddenly, I was seeing me, this kid who played the violin and
wore glasses and was allergic to everything. He even had my name.
When the show ended, I saw it was Neal and Carol's show.''
   Neal Marlens, Arnold's friend, and his wife, Carol Black,
created the show about adolescents growing up during the late 1960s.
   Marlens and Arnold were best friends growing up in the New York
City suburb of Huntington Station. Marlens' character on the show,
Kevin Arnold, is played by actor Fred Savage. Paul Pfeiffer, the
character based on Paul Arnold, is portrayed by Josh Saviano.
   Arnold said the show's details make ``The Wonder Years'' real
for him.
   ``For instance, I remember how we agonized before calling a girl
on the phone. You'd sit there for hours, just trying to get up the
courage to do it. There were hundreds of moments like that in the
show,'' he said.

get the loot to the betting parlors.
   An armored car carrying 11 tons of quarters and nickels intended

   Post-Halloween pumpkin residue,
toilet-papered trees and egg-stained windows didn't haunt people
who took out their Spook Insurance.
   About 25 teen-agers armed with rakes, razor blades, buckets and
sponges set out Wednesday to clean up the frightful mess _ but only
for those businesses and homeowners wise enough to have paid their
prank premiums.
   For 10 years, members of the YMCA Leaders Club in Lowell, about
15 miles east of Grand Rapids, have been selling the Halloween
``insurance'' policies. Homeowners pay $2, small businesses pay $5
and large businesses pay $10. The fund-raiser nets the group about
$300 a year.
   ``We have to climb the trees when they throw (toilet paper) up
there,'' volunteer adviser Phil Beachler said. ``We send up the
smallest kid.''
   Last year, the club cleared one yard of so many smashed pumpkins
it took a truck to haul the mess away. There was a tombstone in
another yard.
   Beachler said the club has learned which areas are hit hardest
and where the insurance sells best. It also has learned when to
turn business away.
   ``We don't sell any Spook Insurance to teachers or (school)
administrators,'' he said, ``because they're too high-risk.''

   President Wojciech Jaruzelski has
appointed an aide to Solidarity leader Lech Walesa to serve as a
minister of state responsible for contacts with parliament.
   Piotr Nowina-Konopka, an economist and head of the Solidarity
press bureau in the Baltic port of Gdansk, confirmed by telephone
Wednesday that he had accepted Jaruzelski's offer.
   Under the constitution, the president has the right to appoint
ministers of state who report to him.
   Jaruzelski also named Jozef Koziol, a member of the Peasant
Party, which forms part of the Solidarity-led coalition in
parliament, to be a minister of state, the agency reported.
   After his election to the new powerful post of president on July
19, Jaruzelski said he wanted to create a staff composed of a broad
range of political views in Poland.
   But until now, the top posts in his chancellery have gone to
Communist Party members. Jozef Czyrek, a former foreign minister
and current member of the party's Politburo, is responsbile for
foreign affairs in the presidential chancellery.

<HEAD>Job Exposure to Form of Asbestos Triples Death Rate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Relatively brief on-the-job exposure to a highly
toxic form of asbestos appears to dramatically increase the risk of
death from asbestos-related illnesses, according to a study
published today.
   The researchers studied 33 men who had worked in 1953 at a paper
factory that made cigarette filters containing crocidolite fibers,
a form of asbestos. Twenty-eight had died, triple the expected
death rate.
   The increased mortality was almost entirely attributable to 18
deaths from three asbestos-associated diseases _ lung cancer,
malignant mesothelioma and asbestosis. The men had worked in the
factory a median of under two years.
   Work exposure to other forms of asbestos also has been linked
with lung diseases, but crocidolite is thought to be especially
hazardous.
   The researchers said doctors should be alert to the appearance
of asbestos-related diseases from unusual sources of industrial
exposure.
   ``These results emphasize that intense, localized occupatonal
exposures to asbestos may have effects decades after the exposures
cease and that such effects may remain unrecognized and
unreported,'' they wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine.
   They said it is unclear whether smoking cigarettes with the
asbestos-laden filters increased the risk of disease.
   The study was conducted by James A. Talcott of Dana-Farber
Cancer Institute in Boston.

   Former child television star Todd Bridges
broke into sobs at his attempted murder trial, saying he was
suicidal and addicted to cocaine when an alleged drug dealer was
shot.
   The actor testified he couldn't remember shooting anyone, saying
his first memory after the assault was of a friend rushing him out
of the house.
   ``To be honest, I was going to try to get another hit (of
cocaine),'' the 24-year-old Bridges said.
   For eight years, Bridges played actor Gary Coleman's older
brother on the TV series ``Diff'rent Strokes.'' On Tuesday, Bridges
testified that when the situation comedy was canceled in 1986, he
discovered his accountant had embezzled more than $1 million from
him.
   Fighting tears, he said: ``It came to the point where I became
very mentally unstable. ... The only thing I had left was to kill
myself.''
   He is charged with attempted murder in the Feb. 2 shooting of
Kenneth ``Tex'' Clay during a scuffle in a Los Angeles crack house.
   Bridges' defense attorney maintains his client was acting in
self-defense when Clay was shot.

   Five hotels owned by Leona Helmsley may lose
their liquor licenses following the hotel queen's recent conviction
for federal tax evasion, a state official says.
   That's because convicted felons are barred form selling
alcoholic beverages or having a direct or indirect interest in
liquor licenses, said Richard Chernela, a spokesman for the state
Liquor Authority.
   Helmsley and her aide, Joseph C. Licari, were convicted Aug. 30
of 33 counts of evading payment of $1.2 million in federal taxes.
   The five Manhattan hotels are the Helmsley Palace, the Harley
Hotel, the Windsor Hotel, the Carlton House and the Park Lane Hotel.
   Helmsley, portrayed in advertisements as a persnickety hotel
queen, must apply to a state judge for a certificate of relief,
Chernela said.
   If the certificate is granted, the liquor authority has the
choice of suspending or revoking the license, or doing nothing,
Chernela said.
   But without the certificate, the hotels cannot sell alcohol
after Dec. 1, drying up restaurants, room service and banquets, he
said.
   Richard O'Neill, a lawyer representing Helmsley before the
liquor board, did not return phone calls Monday evening.

   ABC's World Series coverage fell in the
ratings like a Texas League fly ball but the network could take
comfort that ``Roseanne'' was first in the A.C. Nielsen Co. survey.
   NBC was first in the ratings for last week and ABC was a close
second.
   The last two games of the earthquake-delayed World Series fared
poorly, considering that the first two games helped put ABC in
first place two weeks ago and ended NBC's record 68-week winning
streak.
   The third game between the San Francisco Giants and the Oakland
Athletics was 18th. The fourth game on Saturday, in which the A's
wrapped up the series in four straight, was 29th.
   The second game, played before the Oct. 17 earthquake delayed
the series, was 16th and the first game tied for 18th place.
Although even those ratings were off from previous years, they
still helped ABC take first place for the week.
   ABC had better luck with its football coverage. The Monday night
game between the Chicago Bears and the Cleveland Browns finished in
ninth place.
   First-place NBC's average in the Nielsen survey was 14.9, to
ABC's 14.2 and CBS' 13.0. A rating point is the percentage of the
nation's 92.1 million homes with televisions.
   Here are last week's top 10 prime-time shows: ABC's
``Roseanne,'' NBC's ``The Cosby Show,'' NBC's ``Cheers,'' CBS' ``60
Minutes,'' NBC's ``A Different World,'' CBS' ``Murder, She Wrote,''
ABC's ``The Wonder Years,'' NBC's ``Golden Girls,'' ABC's Monday
Night Football and NBC's ``In the Heat of the Night.''
   The 27th anniversary celebration of Johnny Carson's tenure as
host of ``The Tonight Show'' was 15th.
   Fox Broadcasting Co's highest-ranked show was ``Married ... With
Children,'' in 39th place.
   ``The ABC Evening News'' was the highest-rated news show last
week. The ratings: ABC 10.3, CBS 10.0 and NBC 9.6.
   The lowest-rated network show was CBS' ``Wolf.''
   Here are the bottom five network shows: ABC's Saturday World
Series preview, CBS' ``Saturday Night with Connie Chung,'' ABC's
``Ghostbusters'' Halloween special, CBS' ``Tour of Duty'' and CBS'
``Wolf.''

<HEAD>Texas Judge Cleared of Bias in Gay Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge who called two murder victims ``queers''
and said he considered their homosexuality a mitigating factor in
sentencing their killer was cleared of bias charges Tuesday by a
special master.
   Special Master Robert R. Murray ruled that State District Judge
Jack Hampton violated Texas' judicial code by commenting on a
pending case, but rejected allegations of bias and discrediting the
judiciary.
   Murray ruled that Hampton would be impartial in any case that
came before him, including those involving homosexuals.
   The ruling drew an angry reaction from the Dallas Gay Alliance,
which has urged Hampton's removal from the bench since his remarks
were published last December.
   ``This is like saying, `Yes, he was a bigot, but he won't be one
in the future,''' said alliance President William Waybourn.
   In an interview last December in which Hampton, discussing the
double-murder trial of Richard Lee Bednarski, said he considered
the victims' homosexuality as a mitigating factor when he sentenced
him last November.
   Bednarski, 18, could have been sentenced to life in prison, but
got 30 years from Hampton for shooting two men to death in a park.
   In the Dec. 15 interview with the Dallas Times Herald, Hampton
said, ``These homosexuals by running around on weekends picking up
teen-age boys, they're asking for trouble. They really are.
   ``I don't much care for queers cruising the streets picking up
teen-age boys,'' the judge said.
   Murray also considered statements Hampton made to The Associated
Press on Dec. 16, the day the original interview was published in
the Herald.
   In that interview, Hampton was quoted as saying that had the
murder victims ``not been out there trying to spread AIDS around,
they'd still be alive today.''
   Murray, a retired appellate judge from San Antonio, was
appointed to make findings on the facts of the case but not to
recommend what action, if any, the State Commission on Judicial
Conduct should take regarding Hampton.
   His findings are expected to be reviewed by the commission at a
special meeting, possibly in November. The commission has the power
to impose sanctions or to begin a process to remove Hampton from
the bench.
   Hampton acknowledged Tuesday that he has seen Murray's report,
but he declined to comment.
   ``I'm not talking to any reporters anymore,'' he said.

   Poland today became the second Warsaw
Pact country to establish formal diplomatic relations with South
Korea, the Foreign Ministry announced.
   Seoul established ties with Hungary in February.
   It addition to signing an accord today restoring diplomatic
relations, Polish and South Korean officials also signed a trade
and investment agreement.
   The Foreign Ministry said in an announcement that diplomatic
relations between the two countries are expected to ``contribute to
the ongoing processes of democratization and economic restructuring
in Poland.''
   The Seoul government, seeking to enhance its international
standing and develop markets abroad, has been trying to improve
relations with China, the Soviet Union and other countries that
have formal ties with North Korea.
   The announcement said both South Korea and Poland ``are
confident that the establishment of diplomatic relations between
the two nations will contribute greatly not only to the
develoipment of friendly and cooperative bilateral ties but also to
easing tension on the Korean Peninsula and promoting world peace.''
   It added that the development was ``expected to have a favorable
effect on efforts to establish similar relations with other
socialist countries which still do not have formal relations with
this country.''

<HEAD>Judge Rules City Flag Desecration Ordinance Unconstitutional</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge on Tuesday ruled that the city's
ordinance banning desecration of the American flag is
unconstitutional, and granted an injunction requested by 10 local
artists banning enforcement of the law.
   Cook County Circuit Judge Kenneth L. Gillis said the 7-month-old
ordinance was too vague and violated the freedom of expression by
the artists, all of whom used the flag in some form in their works.
   Gillis ruled on a lawsuit against the artists by the city.
   The artists included ``Dread'' Scott Tyler, who was one of four
people arrested on the steps of the U.S. Capitol on Monday for
setting fire to American flags.
   A conceptual work Tyler did as a student at the School of the
Art Institute of Chicago prompted Chicago's flag desecration
ordinance. That work, titled ``What is the Proper Way to Display
the U.S. Flag?'' featured a flag laid on the floor, where gallery
visitors could step on it.
   Gillis ruled in March that the work did not violate Illinois'
existing flag desecration law, so the City Council drafted the
local ordinance, which specifically forbids such display of the
flag.
   ``It is the nation's resilience, not its rigidity, which is at
work here,'' Gillis said in his injunction, citing a recent U.S.
Supreme Court decision in a Texas flag-burning case that permitted
such acts. That ruling led to passage of a federal flag desecration
law that went into effect Sunday.
   The artists, who were being defended by the American Civil
Liberties Union of Illinois, are members of the Coalition for
Artists' Rights. They had planned to show their flag-related works
at several galleries under the exhibit title of ``Inalienable
Rights, Alienable Wrongs,'' but filed legal questions with the city
after several gallery owners cancelled showings because of possible
prosecution.
   ``We wrote to the Chicago Corporation Counsel's office seeking
to determine if the artists could exhibit their works without the
threat of arrest, seizure of their art and criminal prosecutions,''
ACLU attorney Harvey Grossman said last week. ``Their response was
to file a lawsuit against works of art that haven't even been
displayed yet.''

<HEAD>Soviets Hope Summit Offers Opportunity to Help Economy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Kremlin clearly hopes President Bush, in an
early December meeting with Mikhail S. Gorbachev, will be open to
agreement on steps that would help give the battered Soviet economy
a badly needed boost.
   Although Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze bristled as he
denied U.S. reports the meeting would develop an aid plan for the
Soviet economy, there was little doubt that cooperation was on the
minds of Soviet officials.
   ``When they say, `To help or assist the Soviet Union,' it
touches our national dignity because we have everything to
implement the plans of perestroika and to lead the cause we started
to the end,'' Shevardnadze said as the shipboard summit Dec. 2-3
was announced Tuesday.
   But ``equal and mutually beneficial cooperation'' was another
matter, he said. ``Cooperation, a favorable general situation in
the external world would of course help us realize our plans.''
   News of the summit comes as Soviet shoppers struggle to find
groceries to put on the table.
   Soviet legislators on Tuesday approved an ``emergency'' budget
designed to cut in half this year's $193 billion deficit by
reducing military spending and capital outlays.
   Unemployment is up to 27 percent in some places, with millions
of people being thrown out of work by efforts to restructure the
state-run economy, the Communist Party daily newspaper Pravda
reported.
   A spasm of strikes has cut the stockpile of coal for heating and
electricity as winter approaches, and the official media abounds in
reports of mismanagement that has left vital goods sitting
undelivered.
   The tough economic situation has contributed to a dark mood
among many Soviets, and there has been open talk about the
possibility of civil war, revolution or a military coup.
   A meeting with Bush right after his scheduled visit to Italy
emphasizes Gorbachev's successes in foreign policy, where he has
accomplished much more than in his efforts to rebuild his own
country.
   Gorbachev has said the defense budget will be cut by $16.1
billion by the end of 1991, and he and other top Soviet officials
have said lower defense expenditures would allow the country to
turn more attention to its ailing economy. As the Soviet Union
retires missiles, tanks and other weapons, it has turned some of
the factories that produce them over to domestic production.
   In a report on the legislative budget debate, Tass quoted
Communist Party Central Committee member Yevgeny Velikhov as saying
such factories should concentrate on high-technology products that
could bring in large amounts of foreign convertible currency.
   The Soviets also would like to see the end of U.S. trade
restrictions, but officials understand that in order to join the
international economic community the country has to make the ruble
convertible.
   The most difficult problem for U.S. and other Western businesses
seeking to do business in the Soviet Union is to find a way to
export their profits, since rubles cannot be taken out of the
country.
   Ruble convertibility was one of the issues that Federal Reserve
system chairman Alan Greenspan discussed with top Soviet officials
in October.
   Shevardnadze and Secretary of State James A. Baker III already
had announced plans for a summit meeting between Gorbachev and Bush
in 1990 that was expected to take up the possibility of deep cuts
in both sides' long-range nuclear forces.
   Shevardnadze said the meeting with Bush would be informal, and
that no specific agreements are likely to emerge. But asked about
the 1986 summit between Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan that approached
a comprehensive arms control agreement despite also being billed as
an informal meeting, Shevardnadze only said, ``Let's wait and see.''
   On Oct. 16, Baker said the United States was prepared to provide
advice and technical assistance to help Gorbachev's restructuring
policy. Baker said Gorbachev's policies provide a ``historic
opportunity'' to make lasting improvements in U.S.-Soviet relations.
   In an interview Monday, he said Gorbachev ``clearly faces some
very major problems.''

<HEAD>Johnson, Left Out of Flag-Burning Case, Says It's a `Miscarriage
of Justice'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The protester who started the furor over flag
burning says it's ``a miscarriage of justice'' that he won't be
part of the first court test of the nation's new flag protection
law.
   ``This is a case of selective non-prosecution,'' attorney
William Kunstler complained Tuesday after the government decided
not to charge Gregory Johnson, who was arrested with three other
demonstrators during a flag-burning protest Monday on the Capitol
steps.
   Johnson's conviction for burning a flag at the 1984 Republican
National Convention led to the Supreme Court ruling in June that
such activity is protected under the First Amendment.
   Charges were filed Tuesday against the other three protesters,
but the U.S. attorney's office said there was insufficient evidence
to charge Johnson.
   ``I was there,'' complained Johnson. ``I am outraged'' at not
being prosecuted, he said, adding that the government's decision
was a ``miscarriage of justice.''
   Putting Johnson in the case with the three other demonstrators
would have been ``too much of an organizing tool'' for opponents of
the new law, which took effect on Saturday, said Kunstler.
   Johnson, who spent Monday night in jail with the three
co-defendants, called the government's decision ``an act of
cowardice on the part of (President) Bush and the administration.''
   U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens said his office, not Bush
administration officials, decided the evidence was too thin to
charge Johnson.
   The charges against the three ``vindicate the deep offense
Americans feel ... regarding desecration of the national symbol,''
said Stephens.
   The protesters chanted ``burn, baby, burn'' as they ripped and
burned American flags on the Capitol steps. Capitol police tore
pieces of a shredded flag from the hands of one protester and later
aimed fire extinguishers at the burning remnants.
   The Flag Protection Act of 1989, which took effect Saturday
without President Bush's signature, carries penalties of up to one
year in jail and a $1,000 fine for anyone who ``knowingly
mutilates, defaces, physically defiles, burns, maintains on the
floor or ground, or tramples upon any flag of the United States.''
   Bush has sought a constitutional amendment to ban flag burning,
contending that the statute would not withstand a court test.
   The law sparked a series of protest flag burnings in cities
across the country over the weekend.
   U.S. Magistrate Deborah Robinson released the defendants on
their own recognizance, requiring them to report weekly to federal
pre-trial services offices.
   The case will be assigned to a U.S. District Court judge in
Washington. Kunstler said he hoped the case would be before the
Supreme Court on an expedited appeal within two months.
   The three charged with violating the law are Dave Blalock, a
Vietnam veteran who became an anti-war activist; Shawn Eichman, a
24-year-old New York City artist; and Scott Tyler, 24, whose
controversial display of the flag at a Chicago art exhibit earlier
this year prompted demonstrations.

<HEAD>Panel Asked to Determine Whether Garcia Should Remain in House</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House ethics committee is laying the
groundwork to determine whether Rep. Robert Garcia, D-N.Y., keeps
his seat in the wake of his conviction for extortion and conspiracy.
   A preliminary inquiry announced Tuesday by the committee could
lead to a recommendation to expel Garcia, who faces up to 45 years
in prison.
   The lawmaker could cut the investigation short by resigning, but
he has not said if he plans to quit.
   Rules of the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct _ the
formal name of the ethics panel _ require an investigation when a
member is convicted of an offense carrying at least a one-year
prison term.
   A preliminary inquiry determines whether the ethics committee
has enough evidence to issue a statement of alleged rules
violations, which is similar to an indictment in criminal cases.
The committee could then determine if any alleged violation
occurred and whether punishment _ ranging from reprimand to
expulsion _ should be recommended to the full House.
   Only the House can unseat one of its members.
   Garcia and his wife, Jane Lee Garcia, were convicted Oct. 20 of
extortion and conspiracy for taking checks and interest-free loans
from the now-extinct Wedtech Corp.
   A federal jury found they conspired from 1984 to 1986 to get
$175,000 in payments and a $1,900 emerald and diamond necklace for
Mrs. Garcia in exchange for Garcia's political influence in helping
the military contractor get government business.
   The Garcias were convicted of conspiracy and two counts of
extortion. They were acquitted of bribery and receipt of illegal
gratuities.
   The conspiracy charge carries a maximum five-year sentence and
each of the extortion counts carries up to 20 years. Sentencing
before U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand is scheduled for Jan. 5.
   Garcia, 56, has held his seat since 1978.
   Under House rules, a convicted member is urged, but not
required, to abstain from voting in committee or on the floor
unless he is later cleared of wrongdoing or is re-elected.

   A Vietnamese man who rode for two days
on a tanker's rudder housing to escape his homeland has been
granted temporary asylum in this country.
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service will let Nguyen Van
Tuan, 23, stay for one year, then decide if he can apply for
permanent status, said Bill Bryant, a spokesman for Sen. Claiborne
Pell, D-R.I.
   The State Department initially denied him asylum.
   The INS found that Nguyen had a well-founded fear of persecution
if he returned to his homeland, said Carl Krueger, a lawyer from
the International Institute of Rhode Island, a private agency that
handles immigration cases.
   Nguyen was found crouching on a makeshift plywood seat on the
rudder housing, about 4 feet above water, during a lifeboat drill
Aug. 30, said Jerzy Kolasinski, captain of the Cypriot tanker,
Success. The ship had left Ho Chi Minh City two days earlier and
steamed down the Saigon River to the South China Sea.
   Kolasinski said Nguyen had held onto a rope hanging from the
ship and survived only because the tanker was empty, keeping the
rudder housing above sea level.
   Nguyen endured two days of 100-degree temperatures and had only
a nearly-empty container of water, a pack of cigarettes and a
butane lighter when he was found.
   Speaking softly to translator Joseph R. Le at a news conference
Tuesday, Nguyen said his family was being watched by the government
because his father, now a welder, once was a soldier. Nguyen worked
with his father in Vietnam.
   ``He didn't know where the vessel would go,'' said Le. ``He
doesn't know very much about America, but he's heard that people
are treated well.''
   Nguyen said his parents and four siblings knew he was leaving
but did not know he is alive and in the United States. He plans to
write to them. He also said he has an uncle in California.
   Kolasinski had detoured to Singapore and asked immigration
officials there to take Nguyen, but they refused, as did officials
in Saudi Arabia, and in Bahrain and Dubai in the Persian Gulf.
   When the tanker docked Monday at the Mobil Oil Co. terminal in
East Providence, Nguyen, accompanied by Krueger and Le, was
interviewed for five hours by an immigration official.
   For now, Nguyen will live with Le in Woonsocket, which Le said
has the state's largest Vietnamese community.
   Le said Nguyen had already received three job offers and heard
from two families offering room and board.

<HEAD>Space Station Not Being Downgraded, NASA Tells House Members</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NASA's top officials are trying to assure
skeptical congressmen that a scaled-down space station now on the
drawing boards will have the same capabilities as originally
promised.
   ``Space Station Freedom assembly-completed is going to be
essentially the Space Station Freedom we have been committed to,''
NASA administrator Richard Truly told the House Science and
Technology Committee on Tuesday.
   He said an extensive review that resulted in major technical
changes to the proposed space station was necessary because of
threatened cuts in NASA's budget. NASA, he said, must ``get off the
funding seesaw.''
   ``We have requested multi-year appropriations for each of the
last two years _ without success,'' Truly said. He said longer-term
funding ``is critical to the ultimate success of this program.''
   The space station, Truly said, will still cost $13 billion in
1984 dollars _ $19 billion currently _ but the cost will be spread
over an extra 18 months because of a new schedule designed to
stretch available funds.
   The top-to-bottom design review of the proposed space station
was conducted this summer when it appeared the program might be cut
by $400 million from President Bush's requested $2.05 billion for
1990. The actual cut was about $200 million.
   The changes angered the committee that authorizes funds for the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   William Lenoir, head of the NASA space station office, said the
station _ now estimated for completion late in the next decade _
still is being planned to house eight astronauts and to have 75
kilowatts of electrical power.
   ``These are the capabilities we had promised and they still will
be there,'' he told the House panel. ``It will have more
capabilities than any space station this country has ever flown, or
any country has ever flown.''
   Truly and Lenoir were summoned to the hearing by its chairman,
Rep. Robert A. Roe, D-N.J., who called the revisions a great
disappointment to the committee, whose members he said had sold a
far different project to their colleagues in the House.
   ``Today's hearing is not a pleasant occasion,'' Roe said, adding
that one capability involving the space station definitely was
gone: ``That is the capability as a government to set our sights on
a goal and work toward it with a common commitment.''
   Truly said because of ``the level of budget threats we were
facing there was no other responsible management action I could
take.''
   ``We can't continue to provide capabilities on schedule without
money,'' he said.
   The major changes to the station are technical, involving types
of power, and the means of maintaining the station`s position. One
of the changes simplifies the assembly of the station in orbit,
cutting down on the amount of space walking astronauts will be
required to do. Also, NASA will save about $200 million by not
developing new space suits.

   Democrats are hailing President Bush's plan
for a high seas summit with Mikhail S. Gorbachev, but Sen. Jesse
Helms dismisses it as a ``public relations'' move by the Soviet
president.
   The Bush-Gorbachev meeting _ to be held aboard U.S. and Soviet
warships in the Mediterranean _ could lay the groundwork for
progress on arms control and other issues, many lawmakers said, if
Bush sheds what some term an overly ``timid'' approach to East-West
relations.
   Several said Tuesday the meetings planned for Dec. 2-3 appear
designed to bolster Gorbachev at a time when pro-democracy
movements in Eastern Europe are overshadowing his policies of
restructuring and openness.
   But the conservative Helms, R-N.C., dismissed the whole process,
saying, ``It sounds as if Mr. Gorbachev is just engaging in more
public relations.''
   ``I hope that no fundamental decisions of any sort will be
made,'' Helms declared.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said the meeting ``is a
very positive thing'' that could ``stimulate greater speed in
moving on arms control proposals.''
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said he hopes
the meeting ``will aid the effort to achieve meaningful arms
control at the summit set for next spring.''
   But Mitchell said the announcement of the meeting does not
change his opinion that Bush's approach to increased liberalization
in Eastern Europe to date has been overly cautious and ``timid.''
   ``One change the president could begin with is to support aid to
Poland and Hungary,'' Mitchell said, complaining that aid proposals
are stalled in the Senate by a Republican attempt to attach a
capital gains tax cut.
   Several senators noted a U.S.-Soviet summit at sea would provide
a maximum of privacy and limited press coverage.
   ``A saltwater summit is a good idea,'' said Sen. Lloyd Bentsen,
D-Texas. ``An informal meeting at sea could provide the right
atmosphere to get things moving in several channels, including
trade as well as arms control.''
   ``To get away from the media and everything else for a couple of
days could be very helpful,'' said Senate Republican leader Bob
Dole of Kansas.
   Sen. Steven Symms, R-Idaho, also approved of a meeting on a ship
``away from the fanfare and the frivolity.''
   But Symms had advice for Bush: ``You can always hope for the
best with a meeting with the Soviet Union but you have to prepare
for the worst.''
   ``I hope this signals a more aggressive attempt on the
president's part to seek to respond to a very positive turn of
events,'' said Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn. ``From my standpoint he's
just been non-reactive and not involved on such matters as
political freedoms and arms control that have traditionally been
the backbone of American foreign policy.''
   But Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., the GOP's deputy leader, said:
``That kind of stuff about being timid or too cautious bounces off
George Bush like a .22-rifle bullet off a tank.''
   Sen. Joseph R. Biden, D-Del., a senior member of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, said: ``The president has obviously
got to the point where he feels comfortable with his positions on
glasnost and perestroika and developments in Eastern Europe and I
think that was what was most needed.''
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., was asked if the meeting was a move to
boost Gorbachev at home in view of the many challenges his policies
face.
   ``Absolutely,'' Warner replied, adding, ``We want to see
perestroika and glasnost succeed. Right now those two things are
being outpaced by events in Eastern Europe. So it was necessary for
Gorbachev to sit down with a strong credible leader like George
Bush.''
   Dole echoed that opinion, saying, ``Obviously the Soviets have
problems. Obviously this is going to be helpful to Mr. Gorbachev.''

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar surged against the Japanese yen on
Wednesday, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange recovered
morning losses to inch higher.
   The dollar closed at 143.08 yen, up 0.93 yen from Tuesday's
close of 142.15-yen close. It started at 142.80 yen and ranged
between 142.77 yen and 143.15 yen.
   Despite earlier losses of 95.5 points, the Nikkei Stock Average
of 225 selected issues rebounded in the afternoon to gain 14.99
points, or 0.04 percent, ending the day at 35,564.43. The Nikkei
gained 132.00 points Tuesday.
   Dealers said the index began to recover as individual investors
bought a range of issues in the afternoon session.
   Most market players were reluctant to make major moves ahead of
the U.S jobless rate report for October, scheduled for Friday, they
said.
   In currency dealings, the dollar was higher in Tokyo following
similar upward trends on overseas markets, traders said.
   ``Although the 142.50-yen line was a turning point for many
Japanese investors, the dollar jumped over the line overnight, and
they just let it go,'' said Yuji Nakao, a trader with Chemical Bank
in Tokyo.
   Comments Tuesday by David Mulford, U.S. Treasury Undersecretary
for International Affairs, that the dollar has shown ``modest
adjustment'' since the last meeting of seven major industrialized
nations in September also prompted dollar-buying, Nakao said.
   ``Investors saw his comments as an indication that the U.S.
central bank will no longer intervene aggressively in the market at
the current exchange rate,'' he said.
   But responding to a question from a member of the House Banking
Subcommittee, Mulford also said, ``Intervention can send signals to
the market, and that's important.''
   Nakao said the dollar-yen rate could be stuck at the current
level for a while.
   ``The U.S. economic fundamentals don't seem very good _ the
trade deficit increased last month, and the interest rate gaps
between the United States and other major industrial nations are
narrowing, although demand for the U.S. currency is still great,''
he said.

   President Bush's policies toward Mikhail S.
Gorbachev have undergone a sea change in the five months since his
spokesman dismissed the Soviet leader as a ``drugstore cowboy.''
   Tuesday's announcement of a shipboard Mediterranean mini-summit
in December is an about-face from Bush's original opposition to the
concept of a get-acquainted meeting _ a change of heart the
president acknowledged.
   It also is a departure from the skepticism and initial wariness
he had voiced toward the policies of the new Soviet leader.
   Asked point-blank Tuesday if he now takes Gorbachev at his word,
Bush said: ``I think he's committed to reform. Absolutely.''
   During his presidential campaign, Bush sought to put distance
between himself and then-President Reagan's often ebullient praise
of the Soviet leader.
   He urged caution toward Gorbachev's perestroika _ the Soviet
word for economic restructuring _ and said a Bush presidency
``would avoid swings between unjustified euphoria and exaggerated
pessimism.''
   ``The cold war is not over,'' he declared in a foreign policy
speech in San Francisco on June 29, 1988.
   Bush told a Chicago audience on Aug. 2, 1988: ``We should not
let our hopes outrun our practical experience ... Soviet ideology
has proven bankrupt.''
   In his acceptance speech to the Republican National Convention
later that month, Bush asserted: ``A prudent skepticism is in
order.''
   And it was a prudent skepticism that Bush pursued early in his
term, delaying resumption of strategic arms talks for months while
his administration conducted a wide-ranging foreign policy review.
   Bush also repeatedly voiced skepticism toward an array of
Gorbachev's arms reduction initiatives, saying he didn't want to be
``stampeded'' into taking actions and didn't want to get into a
public opinion battle with the charismatic Soviet leader.
   It was last May, when Gorbachev ``announced'' a unilateral cut
in 500 short-range weapons in eastern Europe, that White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater questioned the intentions of the Soviet
leader and called him a ``drugstore cowboy.''
   However, since then, the administration's policies have changed
dramatically _ both on an overall approach toward the Soviet Union
and in terms of dealing with Gorbachev.
   ``You know, there was one time when I felt that such a meeting
(an informal early summit) wouldn't be productive,'' Bush said on
Tuesday in his nationally televised news conference announcing the
upcoming session.
   Bush and top administration officials traced the evolution in
U.S. policy to Bush's visits in July to Poland and Hungary, and
then discussions with U.S. allies at the seven-nation economic
summit in Paris.
   ``I now have a much clearer view of how our allies feel on
East-West relations,'' Bush said.
   A senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said the idea of a preliminary ``non-summit summit''
came into Bush's mind as he talked to officials in the two
fast-changing eastern European nations.
   The discussions, ranging from Polish Solidarity leader Lech
Walesa to communist government officials, helped persuade Bush that
Gorbachev was sincere in his desire for political reforms both in
his own country and in Soviet satellites.
   Then, the official said, Bush discussed the situation with major
U.S. allies at the economic summit in Paris. ``The leaders of those
countries expressed a hope that he would be meeting with
Gorbachev,'' the official said.
   Bush solidified his plans at a meeting with top aides on the
veranda of the U.S. ambassador's residence in Paris, then
hand-penned an invitation to Gorbachev while flying home to the
United States on July 18, the official said.
   Although the Mediterranean summit was not announced until
Tuesday, it was always considered a ``joint venture'' with the
formal Bush-Gorbachev summit to be held in the United States next
year, which was announced in September, the official said.
   Bush says he's pleased he changed his mind about meeting with
Gorbachev this year and thinks the U.S.-Soviet relationship ``is
moving in the right direction.''
   ``I'm looking forward to this meeting. I think it's the right
thing to be doing. As I say, there was a time when I wasn't sure
that it was, but with this rapidity of change, I don't want to miss
something,'' he said.

<HEAD>Recyclers Aim for Ringing Success With Old Telephone Books</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TULSA, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an effort involving schoolchildren and
corporations, about 120,000 old telephone directories are being
saved from Tulsa's trash-to-energy plant to be recycled into tissue
and other paper products.
   It's called Project ReDirectory, and it culminates Saturday with
the Directory Games, a kind of novelty Olympics at LaFortune
Stadium.
   ``I don't think anyone estimated the enthusiasm in this
project,'' said Wayne Campbell, spokesman for Southwestern Bell
Telephone Co. and chairman of the effort. ``This is raising
everyone's consciousness of recycling. After this is over, it's
still going to do something good for Tulsa.''
   Mayor Rodger Randle has endorsed the project and is having old
telephone directories stored in the City Hall basement, where they
will be available for schools or civic groups.
   Dozens of Tulsa's major companies are gathering their phone
books for the project, which coincides with distribution of the new
directories.
   Collection points have been set up in stores and all 31 fire
stations in the city for the four-week effort, Campbell said.
   Groups from at least a dozen schools also are collecting
telephone books. The school that arrives at the games Saturday with
the most books wins $300. The games will feature book-stacking
contests, book-balancing races, a book-throwing event and other
contests involving directories. The entry fee is one used telephone
book per person.
   Cash prizes also are provided for civic groups and individuals
who bring in the most books.
   ``They're really out hustling to get books. We're going to make
120,000. It's going to happen,'' Campbell said.
   That would represent about one-fourth of the books distributed
last year.
   Telephone directories can't be recycled as easily as newspapers
because of the glue used in the binding and the Yellow Pages
content, Campbell said.
   Directories that once brought up to $60 a ton to recyclers now
bring only about $5 a ton, he said.
   ``It's not a project anymore that can be done by Boy Scouts and
Girl Scouts. It's not a money-maker ... The bottom has dropped out
of the paper market,'' he said.
   Fort Howard Paper Co. in Muskogee has agreed to accept the books
for recycling, Campbell said.
   Until now, Campbell said, the telephone company's ``best
market'' for surplus directories was to bundle them aboard a
freighter destined for Taiwan, where the directories were made into
insulation.
   A similar recycling effort was tried last year in Tucson, Ariz.,
Campbell said. A civic group in Seattle also has gathered telephone
directories for recycling with limited success, he said.
   If the Tulsa project is as successful as sponsors hope,
Southwestern Bell will plan to make the same effort in Oklahoma
City next year when new directories are distributed there, he said.

<HEAD>Judge Says He Acted Irresponsibly in Voicing Personal Abortion Views</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW PORT RICHEY, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge who refused to delay a
pregnant woman's 60-day jail sentence so she could have an abortion
admitted he acted irresponsibly in saying she wanted to ``murder''
her baby.
   Pasco County Judge Dan C. Rasmussen last week denied the woman's
request for a 10-day delay of her sentence for violating probation
on a drunken driving charge, saying:
   ``You want a continuance so you can murder your baby, is that
it?''
   On Tuesday, he said: ``Yes, it is true I made the quote
attributed to me. I believe it. Yes, it was inappropriate for me to
state my beliefs in that forum.''
   The judge's statement did little to calm abortion rights
activists. About 30 members of the National Organization for Women
picketed outside the judge's office Tuesday afternoon.
   Pamela Forney, who is in her third month of pregnancy, has
remained in jail since the judge's decision Oct. 23. Sheriff's
officials have since said they will help her get an abortion if she
wants one, because the denial of medical attention could constitute
cruel and unusual punishment.
   Ms. Forney's attorneys won't discuss whether she will go ahead
with an abortion.
   The judge refused to take all the blame for a situation that has
prompted the American Civil Liberties Union to take over Ms.
Forney's case.
   He said Ms. Forney's own irresponsibility and the media's poor
reporting of the case resulted in an invasion of the woman's
privacy.
   ``The transcript reveals I was concerned with this defendant's
irresponsibility, not her right to an abortion,'' Rasmussen said.
``She can have an abortion now if she wants one, and our sheriff
has said he will make the necessary arrangements if she so desires.
   ``Of course, she could have pleaded not guilty and had her
hearing at a later date and not have revealed her reason.''
   Rasmussen said news accounts of his order never reported that he
said: ``There are agencies out there to help you with this,
whatever your decision is. You might as well take advantage of
them; you don't have to be alone.''
   He said the case wasn't as much about abortion as it was about
the irresponsibility of drunken driving and the state of mind that
contributes to the problem.
   ``The loss of life through any irresponsible conduct is always a
tragedy,'' Rasmussen said, adding that in the future he will
refrain from airing his personal views in open court.
   An assistant to Rasmussen said the judge planned no further
comment on the case.
   Ms. Forney, 26, an unmarried, part-time bartender, said she
needed the delay in her sentence because she was scared that when
she got out of jail, it might be too late for a safe abortion. She
also said she was unable to financially support a child.

<HEAD>Energy Department Accused of Weak Probe on Missing Tritium</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy Department auditors say the department
bungled its investigation of losses of nuclear bomb material from a
government laboratory and isn't seriously studying the possibility
of theft.
   In an internal memorandum, Alfred K. Walter of the department's
inspector general's office criticized the failure to pinpoint a
reason for the losses and urged a special probe focused
specifically on whether material was diverted for illicit weapons
making.
   Copies of the memo, dated Sept. 7, were released Tuesday by Rep.
Edward Markey, D-Mass., who has been critical of the department's
handling of tritium, a radioactive gas used mainly to boost the
explosive power of nuclear warheads.
   The department in recent days has acknowledged it cannot account
for significant amounts of tritium apparently ``lost'' in transit
from the Oak Ridge, Tenn., National Laboratory to several
commercial customers. It has said there is no evidence of theft,
but that this cannot be ruled out.
   Small amounts of tritium are sold by the Energy Department to
private companies in the United States and abroad for use in
biological and energy research and in making luminous lights and
dials.
   About 7 grams have been lost in shipping during the last two
years, according to other internal documents obtained by The
Associated Press last week. Tritium supplies are classified by the
government, but private analysts estimate about 4 grams is needed
to make a single nuclear warhead.
   In his memo to a superior in the inspector general's office,
Walter questioned why the department made no serious attempt to
investigate the tritium losses for nearly a year after a series of
major shipping discrepancies were reported.
   The major losses were in July and August 1988. The first
investigation began in June 1989.
   Walter also said results of the department investigation ``were
based more on speculation than fact.''
   Last week the lab said it had been ordered by the department to
halt all commercial shipments until Energy Secretary James D.
Watkins reviewed the results of the various investigations.
   Walter wrote that although the department has made some progress
in attempting to explain the losses, it had not given enough
attention to the possibility of theft.
   ``It does not appear that (the department) has adequately
addressed the possible diversion of tritium,'' Walter wrote, adding
he would recommend the department start an investigation aimed
specifically at the diversion question.
   In a written statement Tuesday, Markey said the department
failed to take seriously enough the possibility that tritium could
fall into unauthorized hands.
   ``Do we have to wait until Pakistan, Libya or South Africa
announce they've got an H-bomb before we start taking the risk of
diversion seriously?'' Markey said.
   Markey also released copies of an Oct. 16 internal memorandum
from John Layton, the Energy Department inspector general, saying
the unanswered questions had become more troublesome in view of Oak
Ridge's discovery Oct. 5 that tritium disappearances were
continuing.
   The Oct. 5 report of a partial loss of a tritium shipment to
California triggered the department's decision to halt all
shipments from Oak Ridge _ the second stoppage in four months.
Shipments were halted from late July to mid-August because of
losses.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration and the Federal
Reserve are both insisting there is no major policy rift between
the two over the proper level for interest rates.
   But separate appearances on Capitol Hill Tuesday by Treasury
Undersecretary David Mulford and Federal Reserve Vice Chairman
Manuel Johnson revealed the White House and the Fed are not
entirely on the same wavelength on some crucial economic questions.
   Mulford defended the administration's efforts to push the dollar
lower to restart stalled efforts to lower the United States' huge
trade deficit.
   But Johnson, who followed Mulford as a witness before a House
Banking subcommittee, left no doubt the central bank still viewed
fighting inflation as its No. 1 priority.
   He indicated that efforts to push the dollar lower to cure the
country's trade problems were doomed to fail as long as fundamental
problems such as the budget deficit and America's low savings rate
were not addressed.
   Many economists support the Fed's view, contending the best way
to correct the imbalance between U.S. exports and imports would be
to lower America's demand for goods by boosting the personal
savings rate and cutting the federal budget deficit.
   ``There is little room for substantial further reduction in U.S.
(trade) deficits absent a significant reduction of the
saving-investment balance,'' Johnson told the panel.
   President Bush and other administration officials have been
pushing for the Fed to lower interest rates to spur domestic growth
and U.S. exports. They charge the central bank is overly worried
about the threat inflation poses to the economy.
   Lower interest rates stimulate domestic demand and push the
dollar's value lower because foreign investors do not earn as much
on their dollar assets when U.S. interest rates are lower.
   A lower dollar, in turn, boosts U.S. export sales by making
American products cheaper and thus more competitive on overseas
markets.
   The debate between the Fed and the administration was brought to
a head following a Sept. 23 announcement by the Group of Seven
industrial nations that they planned to cooperate jointly on the
dollar and interest rate policies in an effort to curb the dollar's
rise this year.
   Japan and West Germany did increase rates, but the Federal
Reserve has not moved to lower interest rates in the United States.
   Mulford sought to play down news reports of a dispute between
the Fed and the administration, contending, ``The consultations
between the Treasury and the Fed have been close and friendly.''
   There appeared to be a substantial split among members of the
committee over the long-term success of intervention in currency
markets, the process by which governments buy and sell currencies
on the open market in an attempt to influence their price.
   Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, argued that with $400 billion in foreign
currencies being traded every day, foreign governments could spend
only limited amounts to influence that process.
   But Mulford said joint intervention was still useful to
demonstrate the resolve of the United States and its major allies
to work together in solving trade imbalances and other economic
problems.
   Rep. John LaFalce, D-N.Y., said the administration and Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady are being complaent about the dollar's
rise this year and have not intervened quickly enough.
   He said unless stronger efforts are taken, backed by the Fed,
the country's trade deficit could balloon to a record $200 billion
in a few short years.
   Mulford said the current account deficit, which declined to
$126.6 billion last year, may worsen next year after two years of
significant improvement.

<HEAD>Critics Say Alaska Cleanup Plan Lets Exxon Off the Hook</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Environmentalists say the government's plan
for assessing damages to natural resources from the Alaska oil
spill could save Exxon millions of dollars in recovery costs.
   The country's major environmental organizations said Tuesday the
plan doesn't give enough time to judge the long-term damage,
wrongly allows Exxon a part in assessing some harm, and puts too
much emphasis on direct economic costs without examining damage to
Alaska's overall ecosystem.
   ``If this draft is any indication, (President Bush) is preparing
to let Exxon off the hook,'' said Jay Hair, president of the 5.8
million-member National Wildlife Federation.
   Interior Department spokesman Bob Walker said the plan may yet
be revised and officials putting the procedures together will take
into account the criticism and changes suggested by the
environmental groups.
   ``If they (the environmentalists) have suggestions we'll be glad
to consider them,'' said Walker.
   The Interior Department drew up the plan in August and gave
interested parties until the end of October to comment. The plan
outlines procedures that federal trustees intend to use in
determining what Exxon will have to do to restore Alaska's
environment.
   The proposed plan, which will be used by the federal trustees
overseeing the damage assessment, does not set a dollar value on
possible damages, but does establish broad outlines for how damages
are to be determined.
   But environmentalists said in formal comments to the proposed
plan that it could limit the government's ability to recover all
natural resource losses.
   The environmentalists objected most strongly to a Feb. 28, 1990
deadline for the completion of environmental damage studies, saying
many long-term damages from the spill cannot be determined by then.
   The deadline is less than a year after the Exxon Valdez tanker
ran aground in Alaska's Prince William Sound, spilling more than 10
million gallons of oil. Hundreds of miles of Alaska shoreline have
been polluted and many birds and wildlife have been killed by the
oil.
   ``Oil will not disappear in a year,'' the environmental groups
said in a joint statement. They said such a deadline will ``result
in the serious underestimation of damages and inadequate recovery
from Exxon.''
   They also charged that the plan ignores the ``big picture'' and
gives too little attention to damage caused to Alaska's total
ecosystem, focusing instead on damages to resources that have
direct economic value to humans _ such as damage to the salmon and
herring fisheries.
   The environmentalists said the government should undertake a
multi-year study to determine long-term effects from the oil, which
continues to pollute hundreds of miles of Alaska shoreline.
   The critics also objected to the proposed plan's failure to
specifically exclude Exxon Corp., from taking part in making damage
assessments.
   ``Given the potential liability faced by Exxon, the company has
every incentive to minimize the damages and should not be relied on
to conduct any part of the damage assessment,'' said the
environmental organizations.
   The groups that sent a letter to Bush protesting the assessment
plan were:
   The Natural Resources Defense Council, National Wildlife
Federation, Wilderness Society, National Audubon Society,
Environmental Defense Fund, Defenders of Wildlife, the Izaak Walton
League of America, Sierra Club, National Parks &amp; Conservation
Association, Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund, Center for Marine
Conservation, Trustees for Alaska, and a coalition of the
Environmental Policy Institute, Friends of the Earth and Oceanic
Society.

   Top thrift regulators in Washington placed
unusual restrictions on an audit of Lincoln Savings and Loan
Association conducted after the rejection of an earlier
examination's conclusions, a field examiner says.
   David W. Riley, an examiner who helped last year with the second
audit of Lincoln and its holding company, American Continental
Corp., said he was not allowed to see the first report prepared by
thrift agency officials in San Francisco in 1987.
   He and his colleagues also were not permitted to see original
documents _ only copies _ he said, adding that they were told to
deal with only one Lincoln official and stay away from other top
officers, and were denied access to Lincoln's corporate
headquarters.
   ``These instructions were unusual,'' Riley said, adding that he
also was discouraged from criticizing Lincoln's high salaries.
   The examiners, sent from offices around the country to
scrutinize the operations of the Irvine, Calif.,-based Lincoln,
offered that assessment in sworn testimony Tuesday to the House
Banking Committee.
   The panel is investigating the failure of Lincoln, which was
controlled by Phoenix, Ariz., millionaire Charles H. Keating Jr.,
and is expected to become the nation's biggest thrift collapse at a
cost to the government of up to $2 billion.
   The committee is focusing on why M. Danny Wall, director of the
Office of Thrift Supervision, rejected a 1987 recommendation to
close Lincoln from his agency's San Francisco office, instead
ordering a second examination that delayed government seizure of
Lincoln until April 1989. Wall's office formerly was known as the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board.
   Kevin O'Connell, the thrift agency supervisory agent in charge
of Lincoln, disputed Riley's complaints, saying in a telephone
interview, ``Certainly it was an unusual exam ... But the end
product was we found significant insider abuse and far more losses
than the previous exam had found ... and we were the ones who
finally seized the institution.''
   Also at Tuesday's hearing, California state savings and loan
examiner Richard E. Newsom testified that three months ago he
referred to the FBI documents showing that Keating contributed
$850,000 to three voter registration drives after he was solicited
by Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.
   The contributions have been previously reported but were not
known to be the subject of an FBI probe. They included $400,000 to
the Center for Participation in Democracy, which was run by
Cranston's son, Kim Cranston, and $325,000 for the Forum Institute,
which in 1987 gave $550,000 to a group headed by Kim Cranston
called The Organizing Institute.
   In March, Newsom also referred to the FBI a document identifying
a top aide to Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., as a principal in RA
Homes Inc., which failed to pay back a $30 million loan from
Lincoln.
   Cranston and DeConcini were two of the five senators who met
with federal regulators on Lincoln's behalf in April 1987. All five
have received campaign contributions from Keating, although
DeConcini and Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., have returned
theirs.
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the House panel,
said after the hearing that no decision has been made about whether
to subpoena the senators or ask them to testify. Gonzalez said
Cranston and Riegle have offered to appear before the committee.
The others are Sens. John Glenn, D-Ohio, and John McCain, R-Ariz.
   Keating's attorney, Leonard Bickwit, said Keating will appear
before the House panel as scheduled on Nov. 7, but he would not say
if the S&amp;L executive will respond to questions.
   He said allegations made against Keating Tuesday were
``groundless'' and complained that the hearings had become ``shrill
and unreasonable.''
   Meanwhile, two officials of the Seattle district of Wall's
agency testified that last year a top thrift agency official,
regulation director Darrel Dochow, urged them to consider approving
the purchase of a small ailing S&amp;L in Oregon by Lincoln.
   Patricia A. McJoynt, senior vice president of the agency's
Seattle office, said Keating acknowledged he sought the acquisition
so he could move his headquarters to Oregon and escape the
regulatory jurisdiction of the San Francisco office, which a year
earlier had recommended that Lincoln be closed.

<HEAD>House Votes to Keep Lorenzo From Buying More Airlines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas Air Corp. owner Frank Lorenzo would be
barred from buying any more airlines under an amendment approved by
the House.
   Despite opposition from both Democratic and Republican sponsors
of an airline takeover bill, the House voted 283-132 on Tuesday to
add the anti-Lorenzo language to the bill.
   The House was resuming debate with a final debate expected
today. The legislation would give the Transportation secretary
expanded power to stop airline buyouts or mergers before a
transaction is completed. Current law allows for a review of
safety, financial fitness and foreign ownership only after a sale
is completed.
   The amendment sponsored by Rep. Douglas Bosco, D-Calif., does
not mention Lorenzo but prohibits purchase of an airline by anyone
who has taken more than one airline into bankruptcy.
   Lorenzo reorganized Continental Airlines under bankruptcy laws
and earlier this year began similar action with strike-bound
Eastern Airlines.
   Bosco dubbed it the ``two-time loser'' amendment. Opponents
labeled it the ``don't let Frank Lorenzo take over another
airline'' amendment.
   The main bill, which had broad bipartisan support in the
committee that sent it to the House floor, is opposed by the Bush
administration. Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said Monday
he doesn't need new powers to stop takeovers that would hurt the
aviation industry.
   The legislation broadens the secretary's authority to stop sales
that would inhibit competition or lead to a sell-off of an
airline's assets.
   Rep. James Oberstar, D-Minn., chairman of the Public Works
aviation subcommittee, said although he didn't want Lorenzo to
acquire another airline, the main bill gives the secretary enough
power to stop Lorenzo or any other unworthy owner.
   Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., said the amendment would exclude
``fly-by-night artists, those who bankrupt airlines for short-term
gain ... and make themselves fabulously wealthy while the consumers
of the airline are left holding worthless pieces of paper that only
moments before were tickets.''
   Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, said prohibiting owners with a record
of bankruptcy could ``result in disastrous consequences for airline
competition.''
   He said without Lorenzo's actions, the country would have two
fewer major airlines and 54,000 fewer jobs. DeLay said since
Continental filed for bankruptcy, it has grown into a 50 percent
bigger carrier, serving 100 cities with 34,000 employees.

<HEAD>Study Finds Declining Pension Coverage Among Younger Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Private pension coverage is declining among
U.S. workers _ particularly younger employees _ suggesting future
retirees may depend more on Social Security and other kinds of
retirement income, a government report says.
   The share of full-time private workers participating in
employer-financed pension plans fell to 46 percent last year, from
48 percent in 1983 and 50 percent in 1979, according to a report
Tuesday in Social Security's monthly bulletin.
   Because coverage rates probably were underestimated by 1 to 2
percentage points in 1979 and 1983, the decrease may be more
pronounced, the report said.
   The decline represents a reversal from the growth of earlier
decades, when pension coverage rose from about one-fourth of
private workers in the early 1950s to one-half by the late 1970s.
   The statistics ``suggest decreasing rates of private pension
receipt among future generations of retired workers and a
corresponding increased reliance on other sources of retirement
income, including Social Security benefits,'' the report said.
   The Employee Benefits Research Institute, a non-profit research
group, attributed the decline in part to employment shifts toward
industries with lower pension coverage and to a drop in the number
of union workers, whose coverage rates are higher.
   Merton Bernstein, a law professor at Washington University in
St. Louis, said employment has been shrinking in areas such as
manufacturing that traditionally have had high rates of pension
coverage. Areas where employment is expanding, such as service and
retail jobs, traditionally have low pension coverage, he said.
   He said less pension coverage would cause a greater drain on
many government services.
   Future retirees without private pensions ``may have to delay
retirement or they may have a very inadequate income. The less
adequate income is, the more demand there is for other government
services, such as medical care and supplementary income,'' he said.
   The Social Security report, written by John R. Woods of the
agency's Office of Research and Statistics, found the declines in
pension coverage ``have been concentrated among younger workers,
and primarily among younger men.''
   Coverage among those ages 16-24 dropped by 10 percentage points,
from 31 percent in 1972 to 21 percent last year, and coverage rates
fell 6 percentage points for those 25-29 and 4 percentage points
for those 30-34. Coverage was virtually unchanged for those 35-54
and rose for those 55 and older.
   The report said coverage rates for women, which traditionally
have lagged behind those for men, have been steadily gaining
ground, with the gap narrowing from 16 percentage points in 1972 to
6 percentage points by 1988.
   Last year, 49 percent of full-time male workers were covered,
compared with 43 percent of women.
   While younger women achieved parity with men in pension
coverage, it was at relatively low levels of coverage, the report
said. Middle-aged and older women made more significant gains, but
men in those age groups continued to have coverage rates that were
8 to 14 percentage points higher, it said.
   The report also detected a shift from traditional
defined-benefit pension plans toward 401(k)-type retirement savings
plans that allow employees to make tax-deferred contributions to
their retirement accounts.
   Of the 46 percent of full-time workers participating in
employer-financed pension plans, 7 percent were covered only by a
pre-tax retirement savings plan. Comparable information for earlier
years was limited, but data suggest ``pre-tax coverage has
increased substantially in recent years and that coverage under
defined benefit plans has declined substantially,'' the report said.

<HEAD>Dollar Up In Tokyo, Stocks Recover</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar surged against the Japanese yen today,
while the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index recovered from early
losses to close slightly higher.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average more than made up its
95.54-point morning losses to climb 14.99 points, or 0.04 percent,
closing at 35,564.43. It gained 132.00 points Tuesday.
   An active 900 million shares traded hands, but buying pressure
was limited by investors' concerns over the yen's weakness against
the dollar and speculation on possible domestic interest rate
rises, a dealer with Nomura Securities said on condition of
anonymity.
   In currency dealings, the dollar ended trading at 143.08 yen, up
0.93 yen from Tuesday's 142.15-yen finish. The currency started
trading at 142.80 yen and ranged between 142.77 yen and 143.15 yen.
   ``Today's trading was dominated by dollar-buying,'' said Masaaki
Tanahashi, a trader at Mitsui Bank in Tokyo.
   ``The dollar continued to rise as institutional investors and
investment trust companies bought so much of it compared to little
amount sold,'' he said.
   Tanahashi said the dollar continued to strengthen in Tokyo
following an overnight surge in New York, surpassing the
psychological barrier of 142.50 yen.
   ``They (market players) just let it go'' after the dollar jumped
over the line overnight, said Yuji Nakao, a trader at Chemical Bank
in Tokyo.
   Tanahashi said the dollar's recent strength was difficult to
understand given economic data indicating the United States could
fall into stagflation _ rising prices without economic growth.
   ``Regardless of the economic fundamentals, there is large demand
from institutional investors,'' he said.
   Nakao said comments Tuesday by David Mulford, Treasury
Undersecretary for International Affairs, that the dollar has shown
``modest adjustment'' since the last meeting of the Group of Seven
major industrialized nations in September, prompted the
dollar-buying in Tokyo.
   ``Investors saw his comments as an indication the U.S. central
bank is no longer intervening aggressively in the market at the
current exchange rate,'' he said.
   Other traders said Friday's U.S. jobless rate release is being
watched carefully as another important economic indicator.

<HEAD>Prices for Raw Farm Products Rebound</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The prices farmers get for raw products are
picking up this fall, according to Agriculture Department price
watchers.
   Preliminary figures reported Tuesday showed the farm price index
rising 0.7 percent from September to October. In September, USDA
reported the monthly index dropped 0.7 percent.
   The preliminary figures for October also left the index 0.7
percent above the year-ago level.
   Higher prices for hogs, milk, lettuce and tomatoes were mostly
responsible for the increase from the September average, the
department's Agricultural Statistics Board said. Lower prices were
reported for broilers, soybeans, cattle and corn.
   ``Prices for hogs, milk and oranges were major contributors to
the increase over a year ago, but lower prices for soybeans, corn
and broilers were partially offsetting,'' the report said.
   Meanwhile, prices paid by farmers to meet expenses _ a figure
computed only every three months _ was unchanged from July but
averaged 2.9 percent more than in Oct. 1988.
   ``Compared to July, prices were up for feeder livestock but down
for feed and gasoline,'' the report said.
   A survey made twice a year showed prices farmers pay for
building and fencing material and machinery were up generally from
last spring. Fertilizer prices, however, were down from the April
survey.
   Department economists say net cash income of farmers _ gross
cash income minus cash expenses _ is expected to decline from last
year's record of $59.9 billion to a range of $52 billion to $57
billion.
   Economists say the cash income decline this year is expected to
stem from farmers' larger cash expenses as they boost plantings,
and also because of lower federal subsidies.
   USDA economists expect consumer food prices to rise about 6
percent this year, following a 4.1 percent increase in 1988. No
forecast has yet been issued by the department for 1990, but some
in the agency believe next year's increase will be less than 6
percent.

<HEAD>US Research Council Pushes `Lost' Crops of Incas</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's National Research Council is
telling the world where to find the ``lost'' treasures of the Incas
_ not gold, but 31 different crops that could enrich diets here and
in many other countries.
   For example, few people outside Peru and Bolivia have heard of
ahipa, a white tuber the council says is succulent, flavorful and
crisp as an apple, even when cooked. With a Bolivian variety coming
in purple or magenta stripes, it can adorn a salad while adding
flavor.
   Nearly 500 years ago, the Inca empire spread over 2,500 miles
from what is now southern Colombia to central Chile.
   But it was conquered for its gold and silver by a small band of
Spaniards under Francisco Pizarro, who executed the last Inca
ruler, Atahualpa, despite a huge ransom paid in precious metals.
   But while conquerors were searching for gold and other
treasures, the Incas were growing some 70 crops _ more than in
Europe and Asia combined.
   More than 30 of the crops still being grown are described in
``Lost Crops of the Incas,'' a 427-page volume published by the
council earlier this month.
   The potato is the one crop from the Andes mountain region that
spread quickly through the rest of the world because, the study
says, it was convenient in the silver mines and on the galleons
that carried silver to Spain.
   The Spaniards considered Inca crops inferior and insisted
European foods like carrots and barley be grown instead. But
Peruvians in remote areas still cultivate their own plants today.
   The panel found Ahipa, which has been grown in Denmark, a likely
candidate for wider modern consumption because it is small, tasty
and adaptable.
   The plant thrives even in short periods of daylight. Unlike
other root crops, it has bacteria in the root that help fertilize
it so it can grow in otherwise unfavorable areas.
   Ahipa resembles jicama, which is already sold in many
supermarkets and is popular with people who look for specialty
vegetables. The authors of the report think ahipa could be grown in
the United States and parts of Europe, Japan, Australia and New
Zealand.
   Many of the other plants could also tickle the America taste.
There's a bean that pops like popcorn, a kind of potato with a
buttery taste and another that's slightly acid so that it wouldn't
need sour cream when baked.
   There are at least five more varieties of potatoes unknown
outside the region.
   ``Some are golden yellow inside, a number have a decidedly nutty
taste, and almost all are more concentrated in nutrients than the
common potato,'' the study said.
   The hardy oca has become popular in New Zealand. It looks like a
stubby, wrinkled carrot in a variety of shades of pink, red and
yellow. The book's authors think it has a future in highland areas
and it's being tried in Nepal.
   An international conference three years ago proposed that the
seed called tarwi or chocho in Latin America be rebaptized with the
more romantic name of ``Andean lupin'' because of its brilliant
blue blossoms. It contains more protein than peas and beans, and 20
percent of the oil. Researchers are working on it in Britain, East
and West Germany, Poland and the Soviet Union.
   Some have created ``sweet'' varieties that get rid of most of
its natural bitterness so the seeds need little or no washing.
   The authors are optimistic Inca foods can win acceptance.
   ``The English refused to eat potatoes for two centuries, in part
because the Irish ate them,'' they said. ``Northern European
ignored tomatoes even longer, in part because Italians ate them and
even today in the United States, collard greens are unacceptable to
many people who consider them `poor folks food.'''

   A month-old baby was breathing
through a ventilator as doctors worked to keep her alive after she
was pulled from a car that skidded into a river. Her mother and two
grandparents died in the crash.
   Samantha Venable's 19-year-old father, Gabriel Rivera, said his
baby, who had been submerged 45 minutes in the frigid water, was a
``real fighter who's going to make it.''
   Several of his relatives were at the hospital, touching and
kissing the 9-pound infant who lay with life-supporting tubes stuck
in her tiny limbs.
   ``We were going to get married in December,'' Rivera, of
Kingwood, Texas, said about his baby's mother.
   ``Now it's just me and the baby. I feel ... no, I believe, she
will survive.''
   Dr. Jim Piper said Tuesday the baby's ``short-term and long-term
outlooks are in grave doubt,'' but added that she was responding to
treatment.
   ``She seems somewhat more stable, although no one could give you
a good outlook now,'' he said.
   Piper said it would be impossible to estimate whether the infant
will suffer long-term brain damage or other problems.
   The baby remained in critical condition in the intensive care
nursery of St. Mary's Hospital in Grand Junction.
   The accident occurred Sunday when the car in which the family
was riding skkided off a snow-packed highway near Aspen and plunged
60-feet into the Roaring Fork River.
   Doctors and fire crews rappelled down the gorge on Independence
Pass to reach the car.
   Dr. Steve Ayers, shivering in the water, pulled the baby from
the car and said she had ``no pulse, no respiration, was blue in
color.''
   The baby's mother, Kay Venable, 19, of Kingwood, died four hours
after being pulled from the water. Her parents, Omard Harrison, 64,
and his wife, Marjorie, 61, of Houston, also died.
   The family was vacationing in Colorado when their car slid off
icy Independence Pass into a snow bank. They then hitched a ride
with two Aspen teen-agers.
   After that car skidded off the road, Britt Rosen, 17, and Maelle
Deschutter, 16, managed to kick out the windows in the overturned,
partially submerged car, struggle to the road and call for help.
   Samantha initially was brought to Aspen Valley Hospital.
   ``When she arrived at the hospital, the baby's body temperature
was less than 50 degrees, she had no heart rate and no brain wave
activity,'' said Dr. William Mitchell. ``This baby, when it
arrived, was white, cold and just totally stiff.''
   Dr. Hugh Macaulay, the emergency room physician, said
intravenous fluids and oxygen were warmed before they were
administered to the infant.
   ``We used hot towels, but eventually what we had to resort to
was just sticking the baby in a sink of water heated up to about
100 degrees,'' Mitchell said.
   The baby's father, who arrived in Grand Junction on Tuesday,
works at a Houston-area country club and attends a community
college.
   Samantha was born Oct. 1 in Houston. ``I was going into the Air
Force and get some basic training and then we'd all be together and
just live,'' Rivera said.

   Federal inspectors are reviewing travel and
other expenses Martha Hesse billed the government during her three
years as chairwoman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, an
agency spokesman says.
   The expenses include the cost of official trips abroad and
several personal costs, including repairs to Mrs. Hesse's car and a
$374 reimbursement for a blouse that was ripped on the job.
   Ron Harris, a commission spokesman, said Tuesday the Energy
Department's inspector general's office began reviewing the
documents early last week. The commission is part of the Energy
Department. Its five members are appointed by the president.
   Harris said Mrs. Hesse would not answer a reporter's questions
about the auditor's review, but he said she believed she had done
nothing wrong.
   ``Everything was approved, everything was legal,'' he said.
   Harris said the auditors were given commission documents on Mrs.
Hesse's official travel expenses and spending related to security
precautions taken by the government in response to alleged personal
threats against Mrs. Hesse.
   Harris said there had been no allegations of wrongdoing. He said
he did not know what triggered the inspector general's interest in
Mrs. Hesse's official expenses.
   The inspector general's inquiry was first reported in Monday's
editions of the weekly publication Legal Times. It reported that
among other personal charges billed to the government by Mrs. Hesse
was $374 to replace a $535 blouse torn on the job.
   The Legal Times also cited commission documents indicating Mrs.
Hesse had taken 11 foreign trips as commission chairman since 1987,
and that this year she has made at least 19 domestic trips. It said
the foreign trips cost the government $28,000.
   Harris said all the reported trips were speaking engagements
Mrs. Hesse accepted as a spokeswoman for federal regulation of U.S.
energy and power industries.
   Harris acknowledged Mrs. Hesse has traveled more frequently than
her predecessors, but said it was ``just her style'' to keep a
heavier schedule of public speaking.
   The Legal Times also reported the government paid $3,825 for a
home security system and $3,090 for a cellular phone for Mrs.
Hesse. It said the equipment was necessary because of allegations
that her former government chauffeur threatened her numerous times
after being removed from his job in 1988.
   Harris said the security system and the phone were
``preapproved'' costs and it was understood from the start that the
equipment would be returned to the government when Mrs. Hesse left
the commission.
   The Legal Times also reported the government picked up the bill
for $4,270 in repairs to Mrs. Hesse's Porsche automobile, which
allegedly was vandalized in the commission's parking garage by the
former chauffeur accused of threatening Mrs. Hesse.
   Mrs. Hesse announced earlier this month she planned to quit the
commission at the start of 1990 to become senior vice president for
corporate affairs at First Chicago Corp., a major banking
organization. Her term expires in October 1991.
   Mrs. Hesse has been chairman of the commission since Oct. 6,
1986. Before that she was assistant secretary for management and
administration at the Energy Department.

<HEAD>Senate Panel to Pick Up HUD Investigation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate panel will continue the investigation
of multi-billion scandals at the Department of Housing and Urban
Development now that a House committee is stymied by the refusal of
former top officials to testify.
   ``Our goal is to make sure our housing program doesn't get
sacked again,'' said Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., who was named
chairman of the special investigations subcommittee of the Senate
Banking Committee.
   ``Working with our colleagues in the House, we'll establish
causes for the breakdown at HUD and propose corrective
legislation,'' he said.
   Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich., chairman of the Banking Committee,
announced the new panel Tuesday and named Graham as chairman.
   Graham said no decision was made on whether the panel would seek
testimony from former HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce Jr., who has
refused to testify before a House investigative panel by invoking
constitutional guarantees against self-incrimination, or three
former aides who have also refused to testify.
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., chairman of the Government Operations
employment and housing subcommittee, said last week after Pierce's
second refusal to testify that his panel was about to wrap up the
hearings it began last spring.
   The subcommittee conducted a long series of hearings on
influence-peddling, fraud and mismanagement that HUD Secretary Jack
Kemp acknowledged he found at the department.
   Graham presided over a hearing Tuesday by the Senate Banking
Committee on HUD in which a pair of former Reagan White House
officials denied they exerted any influence for projects seeking
HUD grants.
   A third witness, William M. Diefenderfer III, deputy director of
the Office of Management and Budget, acknowledged ``a massive
failure of collective oversight responsibilities, which includes
OMB,'' was responsible for the HUD scandals.
   The cost of the scandals has been estimated at $2 billion to $6
billion or more.
   ``There was a particular responsibility on the Reagan
administration because they had given such a high visibility to the
elimination of waste, fraud and abuse _ that had become almost a
litany,'' Graham said.
   ``The cliche of `waste, fraud and abuse' was just that _ it was
a banner with no substance,'' he said.
   Richard H. Davis, former associate director for Cabinet affairs
at the Reagan White House, and Assistant Attorney General Carol
Crawford, who during the Reagan administration was associate
director for economics and governments at OMB, also testified.
   Davis, who was the White House liaison to HUD, said he talked
daily with Pierce's executive assistant Deborah Gore Dean, who has
cited her Fifth Amendment rights in refusing to testify before
Congress. But Davis said he only passed along correspondence or
calls the White House received from political figures or others
``with no value judgment.''
   ``I can't recall an instance where I was advocating a particular
project with Miss Dean,'' Davis said.
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., who has come under scrutiny in the
HUD investigations because of his active role in securing HUD
grants, offered a spirited defense of such congressional efforts in
a statement before the committee.
   He said legitimate efforts by members of Congress on behalf of
prospective HUD projects were tarnished by revelations of big fees
paid to consultants to obtain HUD grants. ``Sometimes my blood
boils when I see activities of us in the Senate lumped with'' the
HUD scandal, D'Amato said.
   Also named to the new panel, besides Graham, were: Republican
Sens. Connie Mack of Florida and Christopher Bond of Missouri; and
Democratic Sens. Richard C. Shelby of Alabama and Richard Bryan of
Nevada.

   Superpower summits, in which U.S. and Soviet

<TEXT>
   President Bush says he has no agenda for talks
Dec. 2-3 with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, but he can be
expected to raise a number of issues. Here are some likely topics:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   EASTERN EUROPE: The two men must understand each other's plans
and motives in dealing with the sweeping changes under way in
Eastern Europe. Gorbachev has said he will not intervene
militarily, but some Westerners fear the situation could veer out
of control, or that conservatives could topple Gorbachev and crack
down.
   The government formed in Poland by the Solidarity trade union is
seeking $1 billion in Western cash over the next five months to
assist reforms that would dismantle the socialist economic system
there. Hungarian reformers have scrapped that nation's Communist
Party and are preparing for multi-party elections and other
reforms. Refugees continue to flee East Germany, and protests there
are growing, raising questions about a possible reunification of
Germany. The government in Czechoslovakia is beginning to come
under pressure to reform.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   STRATEGIC ARMS CONTROL: The Soviets have opened the door for
major progress toward a Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty by removing
their condition that Washington agree in advance not to deploy Star
Wars defenses. But at a foreign ministers' meeting in September,
the Soviets stressed they would pull out of a START accord if the
United States breaks the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which
bars space-based defenses.
   The United States also dropped its call for a ban on mobile
missiles, another major impediment to START.
   The two sides are divided over limits on submarine-launched
cruise missiles, how to count air-launched cruise missiles, and how
to verify the reductions.
   The proposed START pact calls for 30 percent to 50 percent cuts
in superpower arsenals, to about 6,000 warheads apiece.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   CONVENTIONAL ARMS CONTROL: Multilateral negotiations in Vienna
are making progress toward cutting the conventional armies of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact. Bush has
proposed allowing 275,000 U.S. and Soviet troops to remain in
Europe; the Soviet proposal is 350,000. Both sides have agreed to
limit each alliance to 20,000 tanks, entailing a reduction of more
than half in Soviet bloc tanks. The two sides are divided over how
many tactical aircraft to allow. Other issues involve verification
and maneuvers.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   TRADE ISSUES: As part of his reform program, Gorbachev has been
pressing the United States to allow a wider range of business and
financial transactions, but so far Bush has been cautious.
Gorbachev wants the United States to allow Soviet participation in
the International Monetary Fund and the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade. He also wants Bush to waive provisions of the
Jackson-Vanik amendment that block the Soviet Union from most
favored nation trading status as long as the Kremlin restricts
emigration. Although Jewish emigration is headed for all-time
highs, the administration is waiting until the Soviet parliament
enacts liberal immigration laws.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   CHEMICAL ARMS CONTROL: At the United Nations in September, Bush
proposed that the superpowers cut their chemical weapon stocks by
80 percent as a stimulus to 40-nation talks aimed at eliminating
that class of weapons. The Soviets countered with a proposal that
the superpowers dispose of all chemical weapons. But White House
officials later acknowledged that Bush planned to continue
manufacturing a new generation of so-called binary weapons while
destroying older chemicals.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   REGIONAL ISSUES: Bush administration officials have complained
that the Soviets have not reduced their military aid to
Kremlin-backed regimes facing domestic opposition, including those
in Afghanistan, Nicaragua, Cambodia and Angola.
   On Afghanistan, the administration says that after the Red Army
pulled out last February, Soviet arms deliveries rose. Soviet
officials responded that the United States had violated
international accords that prohibit the shipment of arms across
Pakistan into Afghanistan.
   On Nicaragua, the administration has said that although the
Soviet Union may have stopped direct shipments of arms to the
Sandinistas, the Kremlin has made indirect shipments via Cuba of
arms worth about $350 million so far this year.
   On Cambodia, the Soviet-backed Vietnamese government claims to
have withdrawn all its forces, ending an 11-year occupation, but an
international conference last July failed to produce a formula for
a new government. A government installed by Vietnam remains in
power battling the communist Khmer Rouge, backed by China, and
non-communist opposition forces, backed by the United States and
Thailand. Washington has withheld diplomatic recognition of Vietnam
pending a solution.
   On Angola, the two leaders may try to solve the impasse that has
developed following the collapse of a cease-fire between the
Kremlin-backed government and U.S.-backed guerrilla forces
commanded by Jonas Savimbi. Savimbi agreed to the cease-fire last
June, but broke it a few weeks later. The Angolan government has
complained that the United States has not granted it diplomatic
recognition, although about half of an estimated 50,000 Cuban
troops there have withdrawn.
   On the Middle East, Bush may ask Gorbachev to use his influence
with Soviet allies in the region _ Syria, Iraq and especially the
Palestine Liberation Organization _ to promote a U.S. proposal for
negotiations between Israel and Palestinians in Israeli-occupied
lands. Israel has balked at the inclusion of PLO representatives.

   The Senate has condemned Nicaraguan President

19-month cease-fire in the war with the Contras.
   A strongly worded resolution, approved 95-0 Tuesday, demands
Ortega renew his commitment to the cease-fire and conduct elections

   It expresses concern that Ortega's cancellation of the
cease-fire ``could be a prelude to a Sandinista effort to cancel or
postpone the elections.''
   ``Even Ortega's strongest apologists in Congress are having a
hard time coming up with excuses for this one,'' said Senate

   The House has sent President Bush a bill that
enables home buyers to obtain government-insured mortgages for more

   Acting Tuesday on a voice vote and with no debate, the House in
a matter of moments gave final legislative approval to a spending
bill that included the mortgage provision.
   The measure boosts from $101,250 to $124,875 the cap on
mortgages that can be insured by the Federal Housing Administration
in most of the country's high-cost housing markets.
   The Mortgage Bankers Association of America estimated that the

<HEAD>Poindexter's Attorney Objects to Iran-Contra Prosecutors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An attorney for former National Security
Adviser John Poindexter contends that two newly hired Iran-Contra
prosecutors should be disqualified from handling the criminal case
against his client because they could have seen his televised
congressional testimony.
   During a federal court hearing Tuesday, attorney Richard Beckler
said independent counsel Lawrence Walsh violated his office's own
procedures by hiring Dan Webb in September to head the prosecution
team against Poindexter.
   Another member of the Poindexter prosecution team, Howard Pearl,
a longtime colleague of Webb, was hired a few weeks ago.
   At the hearing, Webb disclosed that he plans to call 46
witnesses in the government's case, including former National
Security Council aide Oliver North, who in May was convicted of
three felonies in the Iran-Contra scandal.
   Poindexter is charged with conspiracy, two counts of obstructing
Congress and two counts of making false statements. The alleged
crimes occurred in connection with North's secret resupply
operation to the Nicaraguan Contras and in regard to a shipment of
Hawk missiles to Iran in 1985 assisted by the CIA.

<HEAD>Bhutto Survives No-Confidence Motion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY GANNON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto
weathered the first major political test of her 11-month-old
government today, surviving a no-confidence motion in Parliament.
   The opposition failed to secure the necessary majority in the
237-seat National Assembly, mustering just 107 votes. Ms. Bhutto's
governing Pakistan People's Party has 116 seats in the chamber.
   ``I have no rancor nor any ill will against those who have moved
the no-trust motion against me,'' Ms. Bhutto said after House
Speaker Meraj Khalid read the count. ``With today's clear vote of
confidence in the government of Pakistan, this chapter is closed.''
   The debate lasted just 2{ hours despite predictions it might
stretch on until Thursday.
   The no-confidence motion, the first in the government's 42-year
history, stemmed from brutal ethnic violence in this nation of 109
million people.
   The violence has chipped away at Ms. Bhutto's power base,
turning the slums of Karachi _ Pakistan's largest city _ into
virtual war zones and creating a big business in illegal arms.
   Some observers feared before the vote that whatever the outcome,
it could ignite new violence.
   Ms. Bhutto, 36, who is expecting her second child by the end of
the year, told a crowded news conference her party wants to open
negotiations with some of her opponents.
   ``This is a time for reflection by the government,'' she said.
``We are exploring the possibility of negotiating with the more
moderate elements of our opposition.''
   She ruled out early elections, predicting her party would be
returned with a simple majority as it was in November 1988.
   Ms. Bhutto's supporters rose in applause as she entered the
chamber at the start of the debate clad in a loose, green native
dress and a white scarf _ the colors of the Pakistani flag.
   Her entrance interrupted a speech by Fazle ur-Rehman of the
small, Moslem fundamentalist Jamaat-i-Ulema-i-Islam party, who said
he objected to Ms. Bhutto's leadership because she is a woman.
   Lawmakers received a military escort to the flat, modern
building that houses the legislature, which was protected by a ring
of troops and police.
   The extraordinary security was provided at the request of the
opposition. Helmeted troops in khaki uniforms, some gripping
machine guns, manned barricades in a 3,500-yard radius of the
assembly, the policy-making lower house of Parliament.
   Police in riot gear patrolled intersections near the building
but there were no signs of trouble.
   Authorities banned demonstrations in Islamabad and some other
Pakistani cities to prevent any clashes between pro- and
anti-government forces.
   Ms. Bhutto's opposition, most of whom belong to the nine-party
Islamic Democratic Alliance, sought the no-confidence motion after
a small party of Indian immigrants who had supported the government
abruptly changed sides on Oct. 23.
   The immigrants, called mohajirs, accused the 11-month-old
Cabinet of failing to fulfill promises to combat discrimination and
provide more jobs.
   Ms. Bhutto denied the accusations, and her aides alleged the
party was dishonestly lured into the opposition camp.
   Both sides in the quarrel have accused the other of bribery and
coercion as they scrambled for votes in the days leading up to the
no-confidence vote.
   Ms. Bhutto's party emerged as the country's largest one year ago
in Pakistan's first free elections after 11 years of military rule
under late President Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, who died in a plane
crash in August 1988.

<HEAD>Boeing Invites Japanese to Join in Developing New Airplane</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Boeing Corp. has invited three Japanese firms
to participate as equal partners in the development of a new
300-seat jetliner, one of the Japanese companies said today.
   A spokesman for Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd. said Chairman
Kenko Hasegawa and the chairmen of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd.
and Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. received official invitations from
Boeing to join in the design, production and sale of the new 767X.
   The wide-body, designed for fuel efficiency and quiet
performance, would be Seattle-based Boeing's entry in the
300-passenger jetliner class.
   The European joint venture Airbus Industrie and McDonnell
Douglas of the United States now dominate that market.
   The three Japanese firms long have had close ties with Boeing
and now act as subcontractors for the Boeing 737, 747 and 757
series of jets. Boeing's new proposal would enable the Japanese to
participate in all aspects of the plane's production and marketing.
   ``It will allow us to learn both the hard and soft aspects (of
the airplane industry) from a top-level firm,'' said a Mitsubishi
official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   So far, Japanese firms have been minor players in the world
aircraft market, producing just one civilian airliner entirely
designed and manufactured in Japan _ the YS-11, a turboprop plane
for 60 passengers.
   The 767X project also might compete for time and resources with
a Japanese government-sponsored program to produce a small,
energy-efficient plane, the companies say.
   They said they will consider Boeing's offer only after extensive
studies of the feasibility of the 767X.
   Dick Schleh of Boeing said the 767X has been under consideration
for more than a year and discussions with Fuji, Kawasaki and
Mitsubishi have been going on for three months or more.
   So far, there has been no decision on whether to proceed with
the 767X, Schleh said.
   Japan also produces, but does not export, military planes,
mostly under license from U.S. manufacturers.
   It has agreed with the United States on joint development of
Japan's next generation jet fighter, the FSX. Critics in the United
States say the $6 billion project amounts to a giveaway of U.S.
technology that Japan could use to become competitive in the
civilian aircraft market.
   Defenders of the arrangement note that Japan originally wanted
to develop the fighter on its own, and say there will be a mutually
beneficial exchange of technology. They say the project is
important to U.S.-Japan defense ties, and will provide about $2.5
billion worth of work for American companies.
   The new plane is to be based on General Dynamics Corp.'s F-16.
   The weekly Japan Economic Journal said this week that the 767X's
total development cost is estimated at $4 billion, and the three
Japanese firms are expected to bear about 20 percent of that.
   The first jetliner in Boeing's 767 series began service in
September 1982. The largest version, the 767-300, has 261 seats, a
range of 4,100 miles and a cost of $75 million to $80 million.
   Boeing's largest plane, the 747-400, can seat as many as 509
passengers.

   A judge allowed the University of Southern
California to cancel a speech by Rabbi Meir Kahane for security
reasons, but a spokesman for the Israeli extremist said he would
speak anyway.
   ``What I see here appears to be a bona fide concern for students
and the speaker,'' Superior Court Judge Kurt Lewin said Tuesday in
rejecting a request for a temporary restraining order against the
cancellation.
   Undeterred, Kahane planned to go ahead with today's speech, said
Ira Braverman, Los Angeles coordinator of Kach International, an
affiliate of Kahane's Kach party.
   ``The rabbi is coming regardless,'' Braverman said. ``Rabbi
Kahane will come to exercise his free speech.''
   The judge scheduled a Nov. 22 hearing on a request for a
preliminary injunction against the university. He also said The
Jewish Overview group, which was sponsoring Kahane's appearance,
could ask at the hearing for damages in the amount of Kahane's
round-trip plane fare from Israel.
   In a statement with the court, Provost Cornelius Pings said he
canceled the event Monday because Jewish and Muslim student groups
had planned demonstrations.
   USC attorney Christian Markey Jr. said the university was
willing to reschedule the event.
   Kahane's Kach party advocates expulsion of Arabs from Israel.
The Brooklyn-born rabbi founded the Jewish Defense League in New
York to mount armed responses to anti-Semitic acts.

   A white security guard has
shot to death his 27th black burglary suspect since 1986, police
and a businessman said.
   Sybrand Louis van Schoor fatally shot an 18-year-old suspect
Saturday at a meat factory in the port city of East London, the
owner of the plant, Peter Augustinus said Tuesday.
   Police confirmed the shooting and identified the slain man as
Lindile Hilti.
   Van Schoor declined to comment to a local newspaper about the
incident.
   Earlier this year, an inquest cleared van Schoor of any
wrongdoing in the shooting deaths of 26 black suspects during the
past four years.
   Van Schoor works for a private security firm that patrols
neighborhoods and business districts by car.
   In July, human rights lawyers tried unsuccessfully to initiate
charges against van Schoor. A police spokesman, Col. Steve von
Rooyen, said at the time there was no attempt to protect van Schoor
and described him as ``a bloody efficient security guard.''

<HEAD>Southern Co. Probe Continues After Guilty Plea by Subsidiary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A guilty plea by Gulf Power Co. has ended one
phase of a lengthy federal investigation of the Florida utility's
corporate parent, The Southern Co., but the overall probe continues.
   For more than a year a federal grand jury has investigated
allegations of tax fraud, improper accounting and illegal political
contributions by Atlanta-based Southern and some of its five
utility subsidiaries.
   On Tuesday, Pensacola-based Gulf Power pleaded guilty to charges
of conspiracy to make illegal political contributions and to impede
the Internal Revenue Service. The company paid a $500,000 fine,
which it may not pass along to its customers.
   U.S. Attorney Robert L. Barr Jr. said he considered the Gulf
Power plea significant but said his office still has much work in
the Southern Co. case.
   ``The investigation is a very active one,'' Barr said. ``We
anticipate further activity, but exactly what will happen I can't
say.''
   The investigation of Gulf Power drew attention because of a
mysterious plane crash April 10 that killed a key figure in the
investigation and the discovery of a dead canary _ perceived as a
gangland-style warning against ``singing'' _ by a grand jury
witness.
   Barr said the crash, which killed former Gulf Power senior vice
president Jake Horton and two Southern Co. pilots, remains under
investigation.
   Gulf Power admitted a long-running scheme in which the company
contributed to various political campaigns and disguised the
payments through padded invoices from companies that did business
with the utility, said a government-filed criminal information.
   The company blamed most of the illegal activities on Horton.
   The government said the contributions were made mainly to
Florida legislative candidates but also included some for
presidential candidates. Contributions went indirectly to
then-Democratic presidential hopefuls Albert Gore, Gary Hart and
John Glenn, The Atlanta Constitution reported today.
   ``We acknowledge with deep regret that federal statutes were
violated, and we must accept full responsibility for the actions of
a member of our management team,'' said a statement from Southern
Co. President Edward L. Addison and Gulf Power President Douglas L.
McCrary.
   Horton, 57, died en route to Atlanta after being told he might
be dismissed because of alleged accounting improprieties uncovered
in a company audit.
   Among other things, the government said, Horton pressured
vendors of the utility _ primarily three advertising agencies _ to
contribute to political candidates.
   Gulf Power was interested mainly in candidates for president of
the Florida Senate and speaker of the Florida House because those
positions have influence in appointing members to the state Public
Service Commission, the government documents said.
   A panel of Gulf Power executives, including Horton, ``decided
which candidates were `good for Gulf Power,''' according to the
criminal information.
   Horton and others instructed the vendors to make the
contributions and then submit fraudulent invoices to the utility so
that the vendors could be reimbursed, the information said.
   Carter Haynes, a Gulf Power spokesman in Pensacola, said two
other executives named in the agreement as having involvement with
Horton in political contributions left the company in the past week.
   Ray Yarborough, 62, took early retirement, and Doug Knowles, 42,
resigned. Haynes wouldn't say if the departures were related to the
guilty plea.
   The utility said Gulf Power's management structure has been
reorganized, a comprehensive ethics code for employees has been
adopted and vendors have been told they are not expected to make
contributions as a condition of doing business with the utility.

   A horse is a horse, of course,
of course, unless that horse is a donkey named Amos.
   The question of Amos's horsehood has been nagging question in
this township, but a judge is about to apply some horse sense and
settle the dispute between the Knowles family and municipal
officals.
   The officials say Amos is a horse that should be ridden out of
town. That's because an ordinance limits property owners to one
horse or pony per acre of property, and the family already has two
horses plus Amos on its two acres.
   Sharon and Michael Knowles say the 250-pound donkey is a pet and
should be able to kick around on their property.
   ``I'd say it's a horse of a different color,'' said township
zoning officer Wayne Pilato.
   Citing a dictionary definition that places donkeys in the horse
family, Pilato told Municipal Judge George Esposito that Amos
should be subject to the same law that limits horses and ponies.
   But Ms. Knowles is adamant: ``The law is very clearly written,''
she said. ``It says horses or ponies. It doesn't say horses or
ponies or their relatives.''
   Besides, she said, Amos is ``more like a big dog.''
   The judge was expected to issue his ruling by the end of the
year.

   Wall Streeters hankering for a Big Mac can
indulge their proletarian urges in an atmosphere suited to their
station in life.
   Welcome to the upscale McDonald's _ where the humble Big Mac is
served in a veritable temple, featuring a uniformed doorman, a
pianist performing on a black baby grand, and even an electronic
ticker for brokers bingeing on junk bonds and junk food.
   ``I went to the architects and said, `I want to build the Taj
Mahal,''' said owner Frank Madalone.
   The eatery 3{ blocks off Wall Street is distinguished by two
massive windows, bordered with black marble trim, the Golden Arches
painted discreetly on each one.
   Inside, an atrium is graced by 2-story-tall mirrors; sleek, Art
Moderne style chandeliers; oodles of plants; and just a hint of
violet neon _ to match the violet suits worn by the smiling
hostesses.
   ``The ambience is very important,'' said a pinstripe-clad Joseph
D'Angelo of Brooklyn, vice president of an international freight
forwarding firm. ``I've never seen a McDonald's so keen on
service.''
   The standard McFare is supplemented with espresso, cappucino and
pastries at teatime, and for the pinstriper on the go, delivery
orders are accepted on a fax machine.

   A judge who ruled life begins at
conception is hearing from ordinary citizens across the country
about his decision _ including one correspondent who hopes he can
help parents beat the taxman.
   Blount County Circuit Judge W. Dale Young says he's gotten more
than 175 cards and letters since he issued the ruling Sept. 21 in a
divorce dispute over custody of seven frozen human embryos.
   The mail is running 4-1 in favor of the decision, Young said,
with much of it coming from opponents of abortion.
   ``God heard in heaven and will not forget,'' said one such
letter, from a preacher in Denver.
   On the other side was a California woman who wrote: ``One can
only conclude by your decision that you were educated at Bed Rock
University.'' She included a cartoon of intellectual heavyweights
Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble.
   A letter addressed to ``Judge W. Dale Young, M.D.'' took the
jurist to task for making what some say is a medical decision.
Young ruled the so-called test tube babies _ consisting of four to
12 cells each _ should legally be considered children and awarded
temporary custody to the mother, Mary Sue Davis.
   One correspondent took a more practical approach to the
controversy. If life begins at conception, he wrote, parents should
get a tax break starting at that moment.

<HEAD>Abbie Hoffman's Ex-Wife and Companion Criticize Connie Chung Show</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A long-time companion and an ex-wife of the late
Abbie Hoffman are criticizing Connie Chung's CBS-TV show for what
they say are its plans to to dramatize one aspect of his life _ his
manic-depressive illness.
   The companion, Johanna Lawrenson, said in an interview Tuesday
she particularly objected to the dramatized segment in ``Saturday
Night With Connie Chung'' being done in what is said to be a news
program.
   ``My basic complaint is that `docutainment' presented as news,
with hired actors, is certainly not a form that should be used at
all for news,'' she said in a telephone interview from her
Manhattan apartment.
   It should not be done, either, ``with a person who is not here
to defend himself,'' she said, referring to Hoffman, the founder of
the Yippie radical movement. He died last April at age 52 in what a
coroner said was suicide.
   CBS News president David Burke did not respond to a request for
comment.
   Lawrenson, who said she lived with Hoffman for 15 years, spoke a
few days after writing a letter to CBS. The Oct. 23 letter also was
from Hoffman's former wife, Anita, and one of Hoffman's three
children, America.
   The letter, sent to Chung, Andrew Lack, executive producer of
her show, and Burke, called the planned segment ``unfair'' and
``exploitative.''
   Lawrenson said she had received no reply from CBS.
   The letter made available by Lawrenson included a 36-page script
thatshe said was of the Hoffman segment, in which actor Paul Leiber
plays Hoffman. The script was sent her by mail, but the sender did
not give his or her name, or a return address, she said.
   In a telephone interview, Chung said no date had been set for
the broadcast of the segment. She also said she had seen the
letter, but declined to comment on its accusations, the segment, or
say if those complaining about the segment would be invited on her
show to discuss it.
   ``It's a story in progress and we never talk about stories in
progress,'' she said.
   Her show's re-creations are interspered with interviews of
people connected with the topic or news figure of a segment. The
show, made by CBS News, has been criticized by traditionalists for
its use of actors and re-enactments.
   Chung, whose show succeeded Lack's previous ``West 57th''
series, said the main point of such criticism seems ``that a viewer
might have difficulty determining between what is real and what is
portrayed.
   ``And I think in what we do, the viewer has no confusion,
suffers no confusion. ... I think anyone who watches our program
can see that.''

<HEAD>Winter Moves into Plains; Indian Summer Leaves Northeast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   November brought wintry weather to much of the country today,
with snow in the Rockies and the Plains states and a chill in the
Northeast, which had enjoyed a prolonged Indian summer.
   Snow was falling this morning from the Dakotas through Colorado,
and was forecast for today across the Great Basin and as far south
as New Mexico. Cold and strong gusts were expected in Oklahoma and
the Texas Panhandle.
   An area of strong arctic high pressure over northwest Canada was
expected to drop into the midwest Thursday and Friday, bringing
snow to Iowa, Wisconsin and possibly farther east. By Thursday, low
temperatures in the upper Midwest will fall to the teens, and highs
will reach only into the 20s and 30s.
   In the Northeast, which had enjoyed more than a week of fair and
warm weather, the forecast called for temperatures to slide into
the 50s and 60s, with rain that doused New York Tuesday moving into
New England today.
   Partly sunny skies were forecast for Virginia, Maryland and
Delaware.
   Tuesday's high temperature for the nation was 87 degrees at
Miami.

<HEAD>U.S. Wants Auctioned Submarine Communications Device Back</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A communications device lost by a
U.S. submarine and sold at a wreckage sale for $50 turned out to be
worth a lot more, and the Americans want it back, newspapers
reported today.
   But Mogens Soerensen, the 41-year-old electrical engineer who
bought the device at the auction, has turned down a $500 offer from
the U.S. Embassy.
   The device is a paravane, which submerged submarines release
towards the surface to receive long-frequency radio messages.
   ``The components alone in the paravane are worth more (than
$500. I can't say how much I want for it. My professional interest
in the paravane can't be measured in money,'' Soerensen was quoted
as saying in the Jylland-Posten newpaper.
   Estimates of the paravane's value range from $30,000 to $800,000.
   The device, which looks like an inverted dingy with three fins
at the bow, washed ashore on Denmark's west coast last summer. It
came from an American nuclear-power submarine on patrol in the the
Atlantic, according to reports.
   Local police notified Danish naval authorities, who failed to
react to news of the find, and it was put up for auction in the
town of Hjoerring.
   The U.S. embassy is negotiating with the Danish government for
its return, the newspaper said.
   A few years ago Soerensen bought a Soviet paravane from a
fisherman who caught the receiver in his net, but Danish military
intelligence seized it.
   Soerensen, who heads an electronics workshop connected with
Denmark's state fisheries and marine research institute, has hidden
his latest acquisition until it can be sold to the highest bidder,
the newspaper B.T. said.

   The dollar rose against most major foreign
currencies in quiet European trading today with some West German
markets and all Italian markets closed for the All Soul's Holiday.
Gold prices were lower.
   Dealers said foreign exchange markets were waiting for Friday's
release of new U.S. employment figures for confirmation that the
economy is slowing down.
   ``There isn't any clear trend,'' said a trader at a large
Frankfurt bank.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 0.93 yen to a closing 143.08 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at a higher rate of 143.45 yen.

<TEXT>
   A state appeals court upheld the final
murder conviction of a couple who said their three victims were
witches who had to be killed.
   Michael and Suzan Carson described themselves in a 1983
jailhouse interview as ``religious warriors involved in a holy war
against witches.''
   Police said they confessed at that time to the three killings,
in San Francisco, Humboldt and Sonoma counties, between 1981 and
1983. In each case they were convicted and sentenced to at least 25
years to life in prison.
   The 1st District Court of Appeal, which had upheld the Carsons'
two other convictions, on Tuesday affirmed 3-0 the third conviction
in the May 1982 shooting death of Clark Stephens near the Humboldt
County community of Garberville.
   Police quoted the Carsons as describing Stephens as a ``petty
witch'' and a ``demon'' who ``wanted to live off (Suzan's) life.''
   Officers said Michael Carson also accused Stephens of a sexual
attack against Suzan; they quoted Michael as saying he had to kill
Stephens under an Islamic command, as he viewed it, to defend his
wife.
   Michael shot Stephens, and Suzan, who was present at the
killing, helped drag the body to a gravesite and burn it, the court
said.
   The appeals court rejected the Carsons' claims that their
confession had been coerced, saying the same arguments had been
resolved in the previous two cases and could not be reopened.
   The court also rejected Suzan Carson's argument that a portion
of her husband's confession had been used improperly against her.
   In that portion, Michael said their attacks ``have really been
ordered by Suzan ...'' Suzan then interrupted and said, ``By
Allah.'' Michael continued, ``Right, I mean ... but, by Suzan's
voice to me.''
   Justice Donald King said the evidence did not violate legal
rules that limit use of out-of-court confessions by one person
implicating another.
   ``Suzan, by adding the explanation that Allah had given orders
through her, thereby adopted Michael's confession and made it her
own,'' King said.
   The Carsons were also convicted of the 1981 murder of Keryn
Barnes, who lived with them in San Francisco, and the 1983 murder
of Jon Hellyar, who had picked them up hitchhiking and taken them
to Sonoma County.

<HEAD>Farm Couple Finds Rare Tyrannosaurus Rex Skeleton</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JORDAN, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton discovered by
a pair of amateur fossil hunters is yielding new insights on the
fearsome carnivore because it includes the only complete arm yet
found.
   Paleontologists unearthing the fossilized skeleton in the
badlands of eastern Montana say it appears to be the most complete
yet found of the biggest species of predatory dinosaur.
   ``We're pretty excited,'' said Patrick Leiggi, one of those at
the site. ```T rex' may be a household name among dinosaurs, but no
one's ever found a complete one, and that's what we've done.''
   The skeleton was spotted a year ago by Tom and Kathy Wankel of
Angela, Mont., on a fossil-hunting trip. They picked up some bones
they found protruding from the ground and turned them over to
experts at the Museum of the Rockies in Bozeman.
   ``We decided that what we had didn't mean much to us and might
be important to someone else,'' Mrs. Wankel said Tuesday. ``At the
museum they were very excited. They knew immediately that it was
part of the shoulder blade and arm of a large carnivore.''
   The pieces brought to the museum by the Wankels proved to be the
most complete arm of a T-rex ever discovered, according to Jack
Horner, head of the museum's paleontology effort. It will help
researchers learn how the short but strong arms of the dinosaur
were used.
   The crew from the museum began digging up the fossils last
month. They're keeping the exact location of the find secret to
deter looting; generally, it's in the Hell's Creek area north of
Jordan, a rich area for dinosaur hunters.
   Working in a pit 20 feet long and up to 10 feet wide, workers
uncovered 24 connected vertebrae in a serpentine pattern, preserved
in spot where the dinosaur died 65 million years ago.
   T-rex skeletons are rare _ only nine nearly complete skeletons
have ever been discovered and all but two came from Montana. Only
three complete skulls have been found.
   Although an adult T-rex could be to 35 feet long, 18 feet high
and weigh as much as an elephant at nearly 6.5 tons, the arms were
no longer than an adult man. Researchers had theorized that the
arms were either used only for mating, or perhaps were slowly
evolving away.
   Matt Smith of the museum's paleontology crew said that studying
the bones found by the Wankels show that the arm was very stout _
and very strong.
   Until now, all the T-rex skeletons found in Montana have been
shipped to museums out of state, but this one will stay at the
Museum of the Rockies.

   Rifle-toting police disappeared from outside the
U.S. Embassy today for the first time since June after former
President Nixon told the Chinese he didn't want to visit an embassy
surrounded by guns.
   An American diplomat told Nixon he had accomplished in one day
what the embassy had been trying to achieve for five months.
   Also today, Nixon told one of China's hard-line leaders that
many Americans feel the June crackdown on pro-democracy
demonstrators was ``excessive and unjustified'' and question
whether political repression in China is permanent.
   Nixon, speaking at a banquet hosted by President Yang Shangkun,
said ``Americans will long remember the tragedy that recently
occurred in this city.''
   Yang and Premier Li Peng are thought to be behind the June 4
military attack on pro-democracy protesters that claimed the lives
of hundreds of unarmed civilians.
   Nixon's speech also repeated the theme he has sounded throughout
his five-day visit _ that China-U.S. relations are too important to
be hurt by what has become one of the worst rifts since Nixon
restored official contacts in 1972.
   ``We must not permit our real enemies _ misunderstanding,
fruitless resentment, endless recrimination _ to close the door we
opened with such high hopes 17 years ago,'' he said.
   Nixon, on the last full day of his visit, earlier told embassy
staff members he had reached few points of agreement with Chinese
leaders over the government's bloody suppression of the
pro-democracy movement.
   ``We see it from totally different vantage points,'' he said,
describing the discussions as ``like two ships passing in the
dark.''
   A member of the Nixon party said the former president, in a
meeting with Premier Li Monday, told the Chinese he didn't like
guns and didn't want to see guards with AK-47s outside the U.S.
Embassy when he visited.
   The embassy has protested three times in the past week over the
alleged harassment of diplomats and their families _ including
police pointing rifles at diplomats' children. American officials
also have expressed concern over sharply increased surveillance of
the embassy compound in recent days.
   Li told Nixon the police presence was needed to guard against a
possible escape by dissident Fang Lizhi and his wife, Li Shuxian.
   Fang and his wife sought refuge at the embassy after the June
military crackdown, when troops killed hundreds of unarmed
civilians in clearing central Beijing of protesters. Both are
wanted by Chinese police on charges of counterrevolutionary
agitation.
   Alhough the rifles disappeared for Nixon's visit, a large
contingent of People's Armed Police remained on guard today outside
the embassy buildings. Six stood at posts around the main embassy
office that Nixon visited, two guarded a consular office down the
street and seven congregated outside the residence of Ambassador
James Lilley several blocks away.
   All wore belts with small pistols. Most embassies have only one
or at most two Chinese guards stationed at their gates.
   On Tuesday, senior leader Deng Xiaoping said China has not done
a single thing harmful to the United States, and accused the United
States of being ``involved too deeply in the turmoil and
counterrevolutionary rebellion'' _ the government's terms for the
pro-democracy movement.
   Nixon and the Chinese leaders have agreed on the need of the two
countries to have strong relations that transcend ideological
differences.
   ``China is indispensable'' in today's increasingly complex
international scene, Nixon said.
   Early today, Nixon spent 30 minutes walking around the Xidan
free market in western Beijing, chatting with shoppers.
   He is to return to the United States on Thursday. Nixon aides
said it is likely he will provide a written account of his talks to
President Bush.

<UNK>Former Norwegian Foreign Minister Prime Candidate To Fill Refugee
Post</UNK>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Norwegian Foreign Minister Thorvald
Stoltenberg has emerged as the prime candidate to fill the post of
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar consulted with
the chairmen of the U.N.'s regional groups on Monday and Tuesday
and Stoltenberg has emerged as the only candidate for the post,
officials said, requesting anonymity.
   The high commissioner for refugees is responsible for more than
12 million refugees worldwide, including 5 million Afghan refugees
in Iran and Pakistan, more than 1 million in the Horn of Africa; a
million in southern Africa, and several hundred thousand in
southeast Asia and Central America.
   The former high commissioner, Jean-Pierre Hocke, resigned last
week. The United Nations is investigating Hocke's handling of an
educational fund for refugees.
   Hocke, of Switzerland, has admitted using the funds to upgrade
airplane flights, but denied that he misused U.N. funds.
   Denmark played a key role in Hocke's downfall by questioning his
use of the educational fund and on Monday Danish Foreign Minister
Uffe Elle-Jensen conveyed the Nordic nation's support for
Stoltenberg.
   Officials said Stoltenberg is likely to also receive the
endorsement of the European Community next week.
   The General Assembly chooses a high commissioner nominated by
the secretary-general, but in practice the leading candidate is
promoted by a major contributor to the refugee agency.
   The U.S. State Department was Hocke's main proponent.
   Stoltenberg, 58, was Norway's defense minister from 1974-1976,
and was appointed again in 1979. He has also served as foreign
minister, in 1959.

   No one blinked when West Germans bought A&amp;P or
when Britons bought Burger King, not even when Swiss bought Mighty
Dog canned dog food. But Japanese buy Rockefeller Center and
suddenly you're hearing jokes about office workers having to take
their shoes off at the door.
   In reality, all was normal at the midtown Manhattan complex
Tuesday: The Rainbow Room did not replace its French wines with
sake; the American Festival Cafe did not introduce sushi; sumo
wrestlers did not shove aside the skaters on the ice rink; the
Rockettes were not kicked out of Radio City by Godzilla.
   But listen to Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, who rose on
the floor of the Senate to warn: ``This year when they turn on the
lights to that Christmas tree in Rockefeller Center, we Americans
are going to have to come to grips with the reality that that great
national celebration is actually occurring on Japanese property.''
   Well, sort of. Mitsubishi Estate Co. is going to buy a
controlling interest in the company that owns Rockefeller Center
for $846 million, and it is the latest in a series of major
Japanese real estate purchases in this country.
   But the original 12-building portion of Rockefeller Center,
including Radio City, may not be controlled by Mitsubishi past the
year 2000, when public sareholders of a real estate investment
trust could take control.
   Meanwhile, the center will continue to be managed by the same
organization that has swept the sidewalks and polished the brass
for 50 years. The new owner will, at any rate, have to obey U.S.
laws, pay U.S. taxes, and generally observe U.S. customs if it
hopes to succeed in a competitive real estate rental market.
   Still, there seem to be jitters whenever Japanese citizens or
companies buy American these days.
   ``Many people have said to me, `Isn't there going to be a public
backlash about Japanese investment?''' Richard Voell, president of
the Rockefeller Group, said Tuesday.
   Mayor Edward I. Koch said he, too, had noticed an
``undercurrent'' of talk that the sale ``is a threat because the
new equity participants happen to be Japanese or not American
citizens.''
   And what did the mayor think about that?
   ``Ridiculous!'' bellowed Koch. ``It's called xenophobia, or,
`Gee, we're alone. Let's keep everybody out.' That's a worldwide
phenomenon and you would expect that it would exist in every
country, but that it would exist to a far lesser degree in ... an
international city like New York. ...
   ``I believe there is absolutely nothing wrong with foreigners''
investing in the city, the mayor added. ``Who cares? I mean, what
difference does it make?''
   Koyata Hosokawa, executive vice president of Mitsubishi Estate,
said American opposition to Japanese investment was ``an
unfortunate sentiment, but it's not a sentiment which (the
Japanese) are particularly troubled by.''
   The largest foreign investors in the United States are not the
Japanese, but the British, who last year invested twice as much as
the Japanese and held assets worth twice as much.
   Although Japanese investors have bought a few well-known
buildings, such as the Exxon building in Manhattan, their
acquisitions largely have been unremarkable. Fearing an
anti-Japanese backlash, the Tokyo government discouraged Japanese
companies from bidding on Chicago's Sears Tower, the world's
tallest building, when it was offered earlier this year.
   ``You know, it's funny, a British or a West German company can
buy something here and you don't hear much about it,'' said
Moriyuki Sawamoto, head of the New York office of a Japanese
economic research firm. ``But if it's a Japanese company, that's
right up in the headline.''
   To Sawamoto, the Rockefeller Center deal seemed like the most
logical thing in the world. Mitsubishi is a conservative, long-term
investor that's willing to pay top price for a world-famous complex
with a peerless location.
   ``No one forced the Rockefeller Group to sell,'' he said. ``They
went to Mitsubishi.''
   Sawamoto was a student at Vanderbilt University 32 years ago
when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik. He remembers how Americans,
accustomed to a decade of global supremacy, were suddenly scared
and frightened by one little satellite.
   ``These days you are not Number 1 at everything, but you can
still be the Number 1 nation,'' he said. ``You shouldn't be too
excited or threatened by day-to-day events.''

   A freight train crushed a car that may have
tried to beat it across the tracks, killing all five people in the
auto, including three children.
   ``It was completely demolished. It was almost like it was real
silent,'' said Nancy Utter, a reporter for KTEN-TV in Sherman,
Texas, who happened on the scene moments after the collision
Tuesday night. ``The only thing that appeared to be showing life
was a baby in an infant seat. His arms and legs were moving.''
   Sheriff B.J. Moore and Highway Patrol dispatcher Shaun Houghston
said the car was dragged a quarter-mile by the 83-car Union Pacific
train. The crossing lights were working and the crossing arms were
down when the accident occurred, the Highway Patrol reported.
   ``I guess it tried to beat the train or didn't see it,'' Moore
said.
   Julia Turnbull, 21, of Bells, Texas; her sister-in-law Dawn
Barnett, 24, of Calera, and her children Michael, 6, and Shcelelia,
5, died at the scene, authorities said.
   Ms. Turnbull's son Darwin, 1, died at Southeastern Oklahoma
Medical Center in Durant, officials said.
   Ms. Utter said lights from the railroad crossing were flashing
when she and a half-dozen other cars pulled up to help.
   ``People were yelling to get help for the people trapped,'' Ms.
Utter said.
   Calera is about 90 miles south of Oklahoma City and just north

   R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. has mailed
smokers videotapes to get its message on TV screens despite the
two-decade-long ban on cigarette commercials.
   The nation's second-largest cigarette maker says the 78-second
videotape commercial about its low-tar Now cigarette is targeted at
smokers of Carlton, made by American Brands in Reidsville.
   Reynolds says the videotapes do not violate Congress' intent
when it banned cigarette commercials.
   ``We're not forcing anyone to watch it. If someone is not
interested, they could simply throw it away,'' said Reynolds
spokeswoman Maura Payne.
   ``The fact is there are roughly 48 million Americans who choose
to smoke, and they have a right to know about the products,'' Ms.
Payne said Tuesday. ``We would defend our right to give customers
access to information about our brand.''
   Ms. Payne would not say how many tapes were involved in the
August mailing or how much the effort cost.
   In the commercial, an announcer compares the two low-tar brands
and suggests that Now smokers are inhaling less tar than Carlton
smokers. The tape is labeled as an advertisement and includes the
surgeon general's warning that smoking is harmful.
   Ms. Payne said the company was encouraged by a 1988 test in
which it mailed videotapes to smokers. The mailing lists come from
smokers' use of coupons and calls to a toll-free number that
provides information on smokers' rights, Ms. Payne said.
   Among those who contend the videotapes violate Congress' intent
are Phil Wilbur, director of the Health Advocacy Resource Center in
Washington, and David Hudgins, spokesman for the North Carolina
group Greensboro to Alleviate Smoking Pollution.
   ``I'm opposed to any type of cigarette advertising,'' Hudgins
said. He said that he was concerned that the videos not be mailed
at random, but that he was not questioning smokers' rights to watch
the commercials in the privacy of their own homes.
   ``I hate to be on their side, but I do believe in certain civil
rights,'' he said.
   Reynolds holds about a third of the domestic cigarette market,
second only to Philip Morris. Its Now brand has a 2.65 percent
market share, and Carlton 4.68 percent, according to the Maxwell
Consumer Report.

   Gay activists reacted angrily to a report
recommending a judge be cleared of bias and misconduct charges for
calling two murder victims ``queers.''
   Special Master Robert R. Murray on Tuesday said State District
Judge Jack Hampton was wrong to comment publicly on a pending case
but that Hampton ``would be impartial in any case that came before
him.''
   ``This is like saying, `Yes, he was a bigot but he won't be one
in the future,''' said William Waybourn, president of the Dallas
Gay Alliance, which has urged Hampton's removal.
   Murray's findings will be reviewed by the State Commission on
Judicial Conduct, which could impose sanctions or begin a process
to remove Hampton from the bench.
   But Murray's report probably will ``weigh heavily'' with
commission members, said executive director Robert Flowers.
   The judge's comments came in a 1988 interview about the murder
trial of Richard Lee Bednarski, 18, sentenced by Hampton the
previous month to 30 years in prison for shooting two men in a
park. Bednarski could have received life in prison.
   ``These homosexuals by running around on weekends picking up
teen-age boys, they're asking for trouble. They really are,''
Hampton said in the interview with the Dallas Times Herald. ``I
don't much care for queers cruising the streets picking up teen-age
boys.''
   Hampton added, ``I put prostitutes and gays at about the same
level. ... And I'd be hard put to give somebody life for killing a
prostitute.''
   In his report, Murray said the statements did not reflect a bias
against homosexuals and did not discredit the judiciary.
   ``Judge Hampton has a reputation for fairness and impartiality
and has never exhibited bias or prejudice toward any group, class
or individual,'' the report said.
   The only thing Hampton did wrong, Murray said, was comment on a
case still pending because of Bednarski's efforts to get a new
trial.
   David Bryan of the Texas Human Rights Foundation, which
instigated the complaint against Hampton, asked, ``How can the
master find that Hampton made all of these comments and that
Hampton would be impartial in all of these cases?''
   Hampton would not comment on Murray's report.
   ``I'm not talking to any reporters any more,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega today ended
his government's 19-month truce with the Contras, citing continued
rebel attacks, and threatened to cancel elections scheduled next
year. He accused President Bush of ``supporting terrorism in
Nicaragua.''
   By suspending the truce, Ortega has invited renewed U.S.
military aid to the Contras.
   Ortega made the announcement this morning at a news conference
that was broadcast live on a nationwide radio chain.
   On Friday, the Sandinista leader stunned a summit of Western
hemisphere leaders when he announced he would not renew the truce,
which the government has done monthly.
   Ortega was immediately condemned and world leaders expressed
concern about his risking the painstaking peace process in Central
America as well as Nicaragua's scheduled elections Feb. 25.
   By going through with the threat, he could trigger international
condemnation and loss of support of Western European friends, who
have defied U.S. pressure and aided Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista
government.
   Bush said Tuesday he would review U.S. policy toward Nicaragua
if Ortega ends the cease-fire.
   ``We are waiting for that re-evaluation,'' said a Contra leader,
Adolfo Calero, in Miami. ``For our part, we have to defend
ourselves. Every man has the right to survive, and we have to look
for the way to survive.''
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
today: ``We'll consider the situation, analyze the options,
determine the appropriate response, but at this point, no decisions
have been made one way or another.''
   Asked if this might prompt the administration to seek renewed
military aid for the Contras, Fitzwater said, ``We haven't even
considered (that). We haven't considered any response, except that
we were trying to preserve the ceasefire and preserve the peace
process.''
   Fitzwater added that he did not expect the administration to
make ``any immediate response'' to the move by Ortega.
   Ortega said the February elections in Nicaragua depend on the
willingness of Bush and Congress to divert humanitarian funds to
demobilize the rebels.
   Ortega's comments differed from the text of an official
communique, which said the Nicaraguan government ``independent of
the attitude that the mercenary forces assume, will guarantee the
good development of the electoral process.''
   In fact, Ortega said: ``Now it will depend on the Yankee
Congress and the Yankee president that these elections take place
on Feb. 25.''
   Under an agreement signed Aug. 7 by Ortega and four other
Central American presidents, the rebels are to be disbanded and
relocated by Dec. 8. In exchange, Nicaragua has pledged that
elections will be free and fair.
   According to the six-point government communique, more than
1,100 Contras have infiltrated Nicaragua across the border from
their Honduran jungle camps over the past three weeks. The
communique said the number of Contra attacks against civilian,
economic and military targets in Nicaragua has ``intensified
dramatically.''
   At the news conference, Ortega referred specifically to the
latest reported attack by the Contras, on Monday night, that left
four civilians dead and five wounded.
   ``We have the responsibility of defending the lives of
Nicaraguans,'' Ortega said. ``Therefore, we can't allow
assassinations to be committed'' against civilians, Ortega said.
   Calero denied Contra involvement in the attack. ``It's too
coincidental not to have been staged,'' he said.
   Ortega blamed Bush in part for his decision, saying Bush was
``supporting terrorism in Nicaragua.''
   ``This is very clear when the (U.S.) government instead of using
(Congress-approved non-lethal funds) ... for the demobilization of
the Contras, uses these funds as logistical support'' for the
rebels, Ortega said.
   Ortega complained that his government had been making a
one-sided effort to bring peace to Nicaragua.
   ``We made an effort for a long time, more than a year ...'' he
said, referring to the truce signed in March 1988. ``We would
present the cheek, then the other cheek.''
   ``But even Christ ran out of patience and used the whip to push
out the merchants'' from the temple, Ortega said.
   Ortega, his defense and interior ministers, international
observers of Nicaragua's electoral process and a U.S. Embassy
official, traveled by helicopter Tuesday to the site of the latest
reported attack by the rebels.
   The Defense Ministry said a group of about 30 Contras attacked
an eight-family farm cooperative near San Migeulito, killing four
people, wounding five and kidnapping one woman.
   After returning from the site, a remote village 200 miles
southeast of Managua, the top Sandinista officials met for four
hours with their top military officers.
   The Contras were forced to the negotiating table with the
Sandinistas after Congress refused to renew weapons and ammunitions
supplies to the Contras in February 1988.
   A month later, the Contras and Sandinistas signed a temporary
cease-fire which the Sandinistas have renewed on a monthly basis.
Talks to turn the agreement into a lasting peace broke down in
September 1988.
   Ortega said today his government was not interested in talking
about the truce any more, but rather about putting a definite end
to hostilities.
   ``The problem here is not the ceasefire; the problem here is the
demobilization ....'' he said heatedly.
   About 11,000 Contras have since withdrawn to base camps in
jungles across the border in Honduras.
   At the San Jose summit, called to celebrate 100 years of Costa
Rican democracy, Ortega said continued attacks by the 2,000 to
3,000 Contras who remain in Nicaragua were forcing him to break the
truce.
   More than 730 people have been killed and more than 1,000
wounded in Contra attacks since the truce was signed, he said.

<HEAD>Proof of `Hard Wiring' in Brain Found by Researchers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists at the University of Southern
California and the University of Illinois say they have confirmed
the theory that the mind stores memories by ``hard wiring'' new
connections between brain cells.
   The findings were to be released today at a meeting of the
Society for Neuroscience in Phoenix, the Los Angeles Times reported
today.
   Psychobiologists Richard F. Thompson of USC and William
Greenough of Illinois worked jointly to prove that the brain
circuitry _ the network of links between cells _ goes through
actual physical changes when a task is learned.
   The so-called ``hard wiring'' memory theory is used to explain
why some learned activities, such as riding a bicycle, are never
forgotten.
   Thompson and Greenough based their findings on a study of 15
rabbits that were conditioned to behave in certain ways. Thompson
rang a bell and blew a small puff of air into one eye of each
rabbit, causing the animals to blink. Soon, the rabbits would blink
every time the bell sounded, without the puff of air.
   Thompson discovered through electrodes planted in the rabbits'
brains that there was increased activity in a group of cells called
Purkinje cells, located in the cerebellum.
   Greenough then studied the rabbits and discovered a greater
number of intercellular connections in the side of the cerebellum
that had learned the blinking than in the side that had not.
   In the 15 rabbits studied over a two-year period, ``the
differences were statistically reliable and clearly visible,''
Greenough said. ``We really have isolated a case where, in brain
cells that are clearly involved in the performance of a task, we
have crystal-clear structural change that indicates a change in
anatomical circuitry.''
   The discovery ``is not surprising, in that it fits theory, but
there has been no particular evidence to support the theory
before,'' Thompson said. ``We were convinced there would be
something like this because memories are never forgotten.''
   The scientists also did similar experiments with 19 rats, which
were trained to walk up an elevated pathway. The rats also showed
increased ``hard wiring'' after the learning the task, but in a
different part of the brain.
   Thompson and Greenough said the findings suggest that memories
can be stored in several parts of the brain, not only the
cerebellum.

<HEAD>Anti-Apartheid Groups Demand Inquiry Into Deaths of Activists</HEAD>
<HEAD>By GREG MYRE</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anti-apartheid groups said
today 11 activists have been killed in unsolved cases this year and
demanded a public judicial investigation.
   In Pretoria, Walter Sisulu and three other recently freed
leaders of the outlawed African National Congress today visited a
courtroom during sentencing proceedings against three white ANC
members convicted of terrorism.
   At a Johannesburg news conference today, seven anti-apartheid
groups said they supported calls for a probe of what they called
the unexplained deaths of 11 activists this year.
   ``Until the police produce evidence to the contrary, the
suspicion will continue in the minds of South Africans that death
squads with alleged police links are carrying out these
assassinations,'' said Judith Hardin of the Black Sash civil rights
organization.
   Such suspicions were heightened when a former security policeman
on Death Row said last month he was part of a police death squad.
   The Black Sash, a group made up of white women, said there have
been 61 unsolved killings of activists since 1977. The Human Rights
Commission documented 11 such deaths this year.
   In the Pretoria courtroom, the three whites embraced the ANC
leaders during a short adjournment at Pretoria Regional Court after
the presiding magistrate ordered defendants Iain Robertson and
Damian de Lange to remove neckties of green, gold and black _ the
ANC's colors. The third defendant is Susan Westcott.
   ``Greetings, comrade leaders!'' Robertson shouted upon seeing
the four men in the courtroom.
   In addition to Sisulu, 77, the visiting ANC delegation included
Ahmed Kathrada, 60; Elias Motsoaledi, 65, and Andrew Mhlangeni, 63.
The four were released unconditionally Oct. 15 after spending 26
years in prison for planning an anti-government sabotage campaign.
   The three whites pleaded guilty in June to terrorism charges and
face life in prison. Sentencing is expected within the next few
days after completion of arguments on whether the judge should
consider any mitigating circumstances.
   A senior police commander, Maj. Gen. Herman Stadler, testified
today that the ANC had recently adopted a more pragmatic approach
but remained committed to the use of violence.
   De Lange, Robertson and Ms. Westcott were arrested at a
farmhouse outside Johannesburg in May 1988. Police seized a cache
of Soviet-made weapons that included assault rifles, hand grenades,
and a SAM-7 heat-seeking missle.
   Terrorism can carry the death penalty, but the magistrate ruled
it out by conducting the trial without two lay assistants whose
presence is required when capital punishment at stake.

<HEAD>Labor Camp Inspection Turns Up Migrant `Wine Book'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENNIS PATTERSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal inspector says the discovery of a
spiral-bound ledger supports what farmworker advocates have said
for decades _ that credit sales of wine, cigarettes and drugs are
used to bind migrant workers to the fields.
   The notebook was given to inspectors Oct. 10 by the wife of a
Johnston County crew chief when she was asked turn over records for
inspection of their labor camp, where 19 migrant workers are
harvesting sweet potatoes.
   Such ledgers are called ``wine books'' in migrant camps for the
cheap wine they often include.
   ``Most of the time we are relying only on the word of the
worker. But in this case you can see the charges that are being
made against the workers' pay,'' said Dewey Thornton, a wage and
hour director for the Labor Department.
   Investigators believe recurring charges in the book of 60 cents
are for soft drinks, while $1.50 and $2.50 entries are believed to
be for cigarettes and pint bottles of cheap wine that can be bought
for half that price.
   A few entries are marked ``light,'' apparently for an electric
bill, said Thornton. But most entries carry no designation. Workers
have their own pages in the book, with lists of deductions from
their pay.
   Thornton said some of the entries could have been for crack and
other drugs.
   ``For the crew leader, that would give him a captive work
force,'' Thornton said. ``If you can get your workers addicted to
crack, then they're not going to leave you. They're going to stay
with you to keep getting the drug.''
   The unlicensed resale of alcohol and cigarettes is illegal, even
if the seller makes no profit.
   Migrant workers for generations have said crew chiefs push a
sometimes daily ration of wine on them whether they want it or not,
deducting the amount from their pay.
   Labor investigators say such practices bind migrant workers to
the fields, either by getting them drunk or plunging them so far
into debt with the crew leader that they cannot move on.
   Ledgers of such sales are only rarely found, but such
discoveries are akin to finding betting sheets at a bookie joint;
the ledgers provide documentary evidence backing up allegations
made by usually illiterate farm workers.
   Another record book discovered earlier this year in eastern
North Carolina carried $50 and $100 fees for ``coyotes'' _
smugglers who help illegal aliens cross the border from Mexico,
Thornton said.
   He said that the investigation of the Johnston County camp could
lead to a fine for unfair wage practices and loss of the crew
chief's federal license to operate a labor camp. The inspector
would not identify the crew chief.
   An estimated 40,000 to 50,000 migrant workers pass through North
Carolina each year, helping with tobacco, fruit and vegetable
harvests.

<HEAD>Lithuanian Communist Party Proposes Break from Soviet Counterpart</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lithuania's Communist Party has proposed splitting
from its Soviet parent and declaring itself independent in defiance
of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Moscow Radio reported today.
   The proposed platform of the Baltic republic's party, which was
published this week, represents the most radical move by a branch
of the Soviet Communist Party in almost five years of escalating
reform under Gorbachev.
   Gorbachev has said he strongly opposes any break in the Soviet
Communist Party. Kremlin doctrine requires that the party be highly
centralized to ensure control over its far-flung units.
   The Lithuanian party's platform must be approved by a party
congress.
   Radio Moscow quoted Lithuanian party chief Algirdas Brazauskas
as saying the republic's transition to economic independence
required corresponding political moves as well.
   The draft platform ``sets the seal on the party's
independence,'' Radio Moscow said.
   Lithuania, along with the other two Soviet Baltic republics of
Latvia and Estonia, is negotiating the details of a plan for
economic independence from Moscow's centralized ministries. The
change will taken effect Jan. 1.
   ``Far from all Lithuanian Communists support moves of this kind,
but we will try to steer clear of a party division,'' Brazauskas
said, according to the state-run radio.
   The Lithuanian branch of the Komsomol, the Communist Youth
League, has already formally withdrawn from its Soviet mother
organization and announced the creation of a new youth group, the
Communist Union of Youth of Lithuania.
   A congress of the nationwide Komsomol last week recognized the
Lithuanian move and began working out details for the transfer of
power.
   The radio report did not define party independence, and
Lithuanian party activists were not immediately available for
comment because of another recent change in the largely Roman
Catholic republic. Nov. 1, All Souls Day, and Christmas were
declared state holidays last month after decades of purely atheist
holidays.
   A Lithuanian activist reached at home said the draft would end
Soviet control over the Lithuanian party. Vytautas Bogusis of the
Helsinki group added that the republic's party ``could still
cooperate with other Communist parties of the Soviet Union and
other Communist parties in the world.''
   Bogusis said the draft had been put forward by party leaders and
members of the Lithuanian Academy of Sciences.

   East German leader Egon Krenz said the widespread
protests in his country are ``a very good sign'' of public support
for the reforms he discussed today with President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   Krenz, who said he and Gorbachev reached ``total agreement on
all questions that we discussed,'' said many of the hundreds of
thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators in East Germany's streets
were showing their support for ``the renovation of socialism.
   ``In this sense I consider this a very good sign,'' Krenz told a
Moscow news conference during his first visit since succeeding
hard-line leader Erich Honecker last month.
   Despite some negative aspects about the protests, ``the main
fact of these demonstrations is to show the goal of improving life
in East Germany,'' he said.
   Krenz's remarks, notably more positive toward the protests than
previous statements, indicated the government will tolerate
continued activism.
   Speaking forcefully in his hoarse, powerful voice and smiling
often, Krenz described an intense meeting with Gorbachev at which
the time flew by unnoticed as they discussed Soviet reforms and
their possible applications in East Germany.
   Krenz said his government's aim is to ``further strengthen
socialism in our country and start reform in all aspects of our
society.''
   He ruled out the idea of tearing down the Berlin Wall as well as
the possibility of reunification of the two Germanys.
   But he said his government plans ``to create expansive
opportunities for each citizen of East Germany to obtain a visa and
passport to go to any country in the world.''
   He said the plans for broader travel rights would be discussed
by the government, the public and Parliament.
   Krenz assumed power as the government struggled to grapple with
the exodus of tens of thousands of East Germans to West Germany and
growing public unrest at home.

   Three nights of curfews and 399 arrests helped
control Halloween night fires, authorities said today as they
tallied destruction from the annual arson spree known as Devil's
Night.
   Police rounded up 65 youngsters on the last night of the 6
p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew, down from 165 on Monday and 169 on Sunday,
said spokesman Sgt. Christopher Buck. The arrests included at least
four arson suspects, he said.
   Detroit had only one confirmed arson fire on Halloween, compared
with Monday night's dozens of blazes in homes, trash bins and
garages. The Monday fires left at least five families homeless, but
no injuries were reported.
   Tracey Bryant said her home was gutted Tuesday evening.
   ``I thought it was just a cheap little joke,'' Bryant said.
``Just like an April Fool's joke. ... A stupid little joke.''
   Elsewhere, Halloween found scores of youths rampaging through
New York City, committing robberies on the streets and in
businesses and injuring at least five people, police said.
   Sixty-seven people were arrested and charged with taking part in
Tuesday's terror sprees, which began in the morning, New York
police said.
   ``Halloween was te excuse for random violence,'' said Officer
Jimmy Lee.
   ``This day every year brings out the worst,'' said Capt. Stephen
P. Davis.
   In Detroit, about 30,000 volunteers joined the battle against
Devil's Night arson this year and police were allowed to detain
minors caught on the streets without a parent.
   Most of those detained were released to their parents after
paying a $50 fine, said Robert Berg, a spokesman for Mayor Coleman
A. Young.
   City officials said the number of Devil's Night fires would not
be released until later in the day.
   The Detroit Fire Fighters Association said, however, about 285
blazes were reported Monday. If true, the number would approach
that of 1984, when 297 fires were reported on Oct. 30.
   Last year, 229 Devil's Night blazes raged, and so far this year
the number is higher, City Councilman Mel Ravitz said Tuesday.
   ``We've got to find a way to either re-educate or incarcerate
those who engage in this sport,'' he said.
   Also, 157 fires were fought in Flint on Monday, including 25
house fires, said Officer Joe Florida.
   Detroit's Devil's Night tradition began about 10 years ago with
pranks such as ringing doorbells and soaping windows. The practice
of starting fires was first acknowledged in 1983.
   The number of blazes apparently peaked in 1984, when
firefighters battled 808 fires during the last three days of
October. The number of fires has declined steadily.

   A son of Philadelphia mob boss Nicodemo
``Little Nicky'' Scarfo was shot and wounded at an Italian
restaurant in what a prosecutor said may have been an attempt to
punish the elder Scarfo.
   A man in a yellow Halloween mask and black clothes Tuesday night
walked up to Nicodemo Scarfo Jr., 24, as he dined at Dante and
Luigi's and opened fire, apparently dropping his gun on the
pavement as he fled, police said.
   Scarfo was hit at least four times, once in the neck and the
left arm and in each side of his chest, and was in critical but
stable condition today at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital,
hospital spokesman Steve Brown said.
   The gunman ``was like greased lightning,'' said Joseph Oberman,
who was dining in the restaurant's main room. ``He came in and out
of the door.''
   ``After the shot, nobody moved,'' Oberman said.
   But another diner, Fran Tosconi, said, ``The dining room was in
chaos.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Joel Friedman said the shooting may have
been aimed at the elder Scarfo for failing to keep some mobsters
from becoming informants. He is serving a 69-year sentence
racketeering at the federal prison in Marion, Ill.
   ``There would be many out there that would wish to punish Scarfo
for the lack of discipline within his family,'' Friedman said.
   Friedman speculated the shooting was not part of a struggle for
control of the Philadelphia-southern New Jersey mob triggered by
the 1980 slaying of mob boss Angelo Bruno. At least 24 men have
been killed in that war.
   ``Many of the important members and leaders of the La Cosa
Nostra are currently cooperating and testififying,'' and some major
mob figures have been convicted, Friedman said. ``That could be
deemed an embarrassing situation for Nicodemo Scarfo as the
leader.''
   The elder Scarfo has been imprisoned since his indictment in
1986 in a $1 million extortion attempt. He was convicted in that
case and later on a murder charge.
   Until his sentencing with 16 others last April, the elder Scarfo
was considered the leader of organized crime in the area.
   The younger Scarfo has had several brushes with the law but none
in connection with the mob.
   Police said he apparently was shot with a semi-automatic version
of the MAC-10 machine pistol.

   Three guerrilla rockets hit the
capital today and killed an 8-year-old boy, the government said.
Supplies began arriving in the city after government troops
dislodged rebels blocking a key highway.
   Trucks carrying flour and gasoline entered Kabul for the first
time in 11 days, a day after Soviet-backed troops cleared blockades
by U.S.-backed guerrilla forces.
   Soldiers with knowledge of the Salang Highway said two weeks'
worth of steady traffic was backed up on the road and waiting to
come to the capital.
   Most of the trucks today were privately owned vehicles. The
govermnment recently has ended its monopoly on the transportation
and sale of fuel and sugar because of shortages. Now it is relying
on private truckers to feed its people and supply them with fuel
for the winter.
   The rocket attacks came after the government had said it was
intensifying efforts to clear guerrillas from the mountains
surrounding Kabul.
   On Tuesday, reporters were shown a captured guerrilla hideout 15
miles south of the city. Tuesday night, government troops fired
dozens of rockets at the Paghman Mountains to the west, another
guerrilla stronghold.
   Since June, rocket attacks on the city have killed about 400
people and wounded 900. The government blamed the guerrillas, who
deny rocketing civilian targets and say the government is killing
its own people.
   At the United Nations, the General Assembly was expected to
approve an unprecedented resolution today calling on Afghanistan's
Communist government and the guerrillas to open negotiations on
forming a coalition government.
   The U.N. resolution called for a government of national
reconciliation that is non-aligned and Islamic. Passage of the
resolution in the General Assembly is a formality, since the Soviet
and Pakistani delegations worked out mutually acceptable language
weeks ago.
   The General Assembly had never before ordered the combatants in
the 10-year-old civil war to open peace talks, nor has it specified
the ideological or religious orientation of the resulting
government of national reconciliation.
   Under a U.N.-mediated plan, Moscow completed the withdrawal of
more than 100,000 Red Army troops on Feb. 15, more than nine years
after the first Soviet forces rolled into the country to back the
Marxist government.
   The rebels control most of the countryside but have made little
military or diplomatic progress since the Soviet withdrawal ended.

   The Iranian government today passed a law
allowing it to arrest Americans anywhere in the world as it
prepared for an anti-U.S. rally that officials said will include
the burning of 160 American flags.
   The new law, passed by Parliament on Tuesday, was approved by
the Council of Guardians. It gives the Iranian government the right
to arrest Americans who act against its interests anywhere in the
world and bring them to the Islamic Republic for trial by Islamic
courts.
   The Parliament members who introduced the measure said it
mirrors a similar power the U.S. government granted itself to bring
terrorists to the United States for trial.
   ``You who scream about human rights and talk about terrorism,
are yourselves innately terrorists and criminals who have taken
security away from the people of the world,'' parliament speaker
Mahdi Karrubi said on a Tehran radio broadcast monitored in Nicosia.
   The new law precedes celebrations Saturday marking the 10th
anniversary of the takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran by
Iranian militants.
   As part of the celebrations, protesters will burn 160 flags
before the sprawling compound of the former embassy in downtown
Tehran, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
   The 160 flags will honor 16 Kuwaiti Shiite Moslems beheaded in
Saudi Arabia for planting bombs in Mecca during the annual Moslem
pilgrimage earlier this year that killed one pilgrim and wounded 16
others.
   Iran has rebutted televised confessions by those convicted that
Tehran trained them and supplied the explosives for their mission.
The Iranians have turned the beheadings into a cause celebre,
denouncing it as a ``U.S. plot.''
   An Iranian newspaper suggested that the former captain of the
American warship Vincennes be the first person brought to trial in
Iran under the new anti-American law.
   The radical daily, Abrar, said Capt. Will Rogers II, commander
of the Navy warship when it shot down an Iran Air passenger jet
over the Persian Gulf, could be brought to trial in Iran under the
measure.
   The Vincennes shot down the plane during fighting in the gulf in
July 1988, killing all 290 people on board. The Navy said the crew
mistook the ascending passenger plane for an attacking F-14 fighter
jet.
   The new law empowers the Iranian president to take all
``necessary steps for capture and prosecution of Americans, as well
as their direct and indirect elements who have been prosecuted in
Iranian courts,'' the radio said.
   It added that citizens of countries which cooperate directly or
indirectly with America in abducting Iranian citizens, or conspire
against their lives or property of the Islamic Republic, will be
tried in Iranian courts according to Islamic principles.

   Some activists say the town meeting is no
longer serving the 50,000 residents of Plymouth, where America's
first such governmental gathering took place 3{ centuries ago.
   The group Government for the People wants a salaried town
manager and a 13-member town council, whose members might receive a
stipend, to replace the five selectmen and 104 town meeting
representatives.
   The selectmen, who get a $2,000 annual stipend, meet once a
week; town meetings, whose participants are volunteers, are held
once a year unless something extraordinary comes up.
   The reformers submitted a petition Monday asking that the
proposal be put before voters in April. They needed 2,900
signatures to get the measure on the ballot. They collected 3,608
and are preparing for the campaign.
   The group says Plymouth has grown too big to be governed by
part-time public servants.
   ``They just can't be responsive to the needs on a daily basis,''
said William Nolan, a former selectman and co-leader of Government
for the People.
   ``The council would be more responsive because they're elected
by geographic area. And town meeting, which has been a real
tradition in this town, is just not working.''
   Town meetings have governed Plymouth since around 1636, said
Grace Karbott, who heads the Plymouth library's reference
department and is a town meeting representative.
   Last year, voters rejected the reform proposal by 55 percent to
45 percent. Adocates of the change said voters were confused by
disputes over the ballot.
   Opponents argued that the town council, led by a manager
considerably more powerful than the executive secretary who is now
the town's top employee, would be a far less democratic form of
government.
   Selectmen proposed to amend the current charter, which was
established in 1973, when the town meeting was altered from an open
forum to one for representatives.
   ``The board of selectmen can continue to run the town,'' said
David Malaguti, a nine-year board member. ``Before we scrap the
charter, the one we have deserves modification.''

   Bands of teen-agers have been jabbing women
passersby with sharp objects in a series of racially motivated
attacks, police say.
   All but one of 28 women jabbed between Oct. 21 and Oct. 27 on
the city's diverse Upper West Side were white, and the attackers
were black teen-agers or young women.
   None of the victims has been seriously hurt, and police have
minimized fears of infection with AIDS, hepatitis or other diseases.
   ``I would doubt if it was a hypo needle,'' said Capt. Maurice
Collins. ``These are very quick jabs, for somebody to be injecting
anybody with a hypo needle would take time.
   ``It could be any kind of a sharp object, it could be a needle,
it could be a brooch pin, it could be a compass point, something
that's sharp enough to prick the skin. ... The wounds are basically
shallow,'' Collins said.
   Collins, who heads the department's Bias Incident squad, said,
``The victims are selected, it appears that they're selected on the
fact that they're white.''
   Most of the women were walking alone on the street in the
evening and ``were approached usually from behind. They felt a
pricking as the black female teen-agers passed them, they observed
laughing and giggling,'' Collins said.
   No remarks have been made during most of the attacks. However,
in one of the assaults, a teen-ager cursed her victim, and in
another case, a teen-ager was heard to say, ``We're going to cut
your hair off,'' the captain said.

   A Halloween parade aimed at saving rain forests stepped off in a
constant drizzle and other revelers found the cost of dressing up
scary, while some cemeteries became a place for the living on All
Saints Day today.
   In southern Louisiana, families spend weeks preparing for the
holiday, cleaning and repairing tombs, and decorating them with
flowers. Today, they were to return.
   ``I been doing this ever since I can remember,'' said
91-year-old Carrie Langemark as she arranged flowers on the family
tomb at a New Orleans cemetery. ``My grandfather bought the tomb.
That's him there. The one that says `1901.' That's when he was
buried.
   ``There's seven of us in here now. I guess I'm next.''
   In New York, the 16th Annual Village Halloween Parade sloshed
its way through lower Manhattan Tuesday evening with the ``Save the
Rain Forest'' theme.
   To enact the destruction of the world's rain forests, a dozen
grim reapers with scythes repeatedly mowed down the tropical
marchers dressed as frogs, monkeys and birds, who crumpled on the
wet street.
   More traditional themes held sway, too. Cross-dressers were in
abundance _ a muscular Maggie Thatcher stumbled along with a dove
tangled in her locks, while ``Mz. New Joizzy'' groused about the
rain mussing his hairdo.
   In Southern California, Batman suits sold for up to $300, and
the rubber mask for up to $70. The rediscovery of the joys of
Halloween parties by many adults spawned a costume-buying boom,
according to retailers who rent and sell outfits.
   ``We're finding that people want to be special,'' said Paul
Abramowitz, president of Hollywood's Western Costume Co., which
bills itself as the world's largest costume house. ``They want to
be unique. And they'll pay virtually anything to do that.''
   Western rents Halloween outfits for anywhere from $75 to $500 a
day, while its average customer spends about $100 a day.
   In Hollywood, where it is often difficult to tell who's in
costume 365 days a year, some 25,000 revelers jammed Hollywood
Boulevard.
   And residents of the Malibu celebrity enclave, dubbed Mali-Boo
for Halloween, dined on the holiday specials at Zooma Sushi and
Something Fishy _ low-tide delicacies many deem scary year-round.
   Trick-or-treaters in the nearby Point Dume area could have a
creepy encounter: Robert Englund, known to horror flick aficionados
as Freddie Krueger in the ``Nightmare on Elm Street'' movies, lives
there.
   The holiday brought real-life horror too:
   _ In Washington, one person was fatally stabbed and three others
wounded as a bar fight spilled out into a street in Georgetown,
where police estimated there were 60,000 Halloween revelers.
   _ Police in Greenville, N.C., arrested about 140 college-age
people they said refused to break up a Halloween street party and
pelted officers with debris.
   _ Halloween terror started Tuesday morning in New York City,
where police reported at least five people were injured and 67
arrested, mostly teen-agers charged with pushing people around and
committing robberies.
   _ A Dallas teacher wearing a military costume shot a 14-year-old
student with a pellet gun, apparently by accident, authorities
said. The teacher was suspended, the boy hospitalized in fair
condition.
   Today's tradition in Louisiana is ``our version of Memorial
Day,'' said Michael Boudreaux, the assistant director of the New
Orleans Archdiocesan Cemeteries.
   ``It's very much a family day,'' he said. ``Some of our
cemeteries are 200 years old, so you might have 10, 12, 15 members
of a family buried in a tomb.''
   The tombs, which exist because of New Orleans' high water level,
resemble windowless houses, churches and monuments. Many are
surrounded by wrought iron fences. Built close together, they line
the narrow paths and streets that wind through the cemeteries. They
are designed for several generations.
   The custom extends throughout south Louisiana and is popular
with Roman Catholics and Protestants, Boudreaux said.

<HEAD>RJR Nabisco Targets $30 Million for Education Risk Takers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The RJR Nabisco Foundation announced today a
$30 million fund to support ``risk-taking'' education programs in
elementary and secondary schools.
   ``The biggest risk in education today is not taking one,'' said
Nabisco Chairman Louis Gerstner. ``Timid, fine-tuning approaches
are not up to the task of revitalizing an education system that is
failing our young people and jeopardizing the future of our nation.
   ``Our goal is to nurture risk-taking, not reward entrenched
conventional wisdom,'' he said.
   Over five years, the program, titled ``Next Century Schools,''
will make three-year grants of from $100,000 to $250,000 a year to
teachers, principals and community groups ``with bold and
innovative ideas and strategies,'' said Gerstner.
   Fifteen grants will be made this spring for fall start-up and
applications will be accepted nationwide. But, North Carolina will
receive preference the first year because it is the home of three
of RJR Nabisco's four operating companies.
   In the second and third years, the program will make grants to a
much larger number of schools in urban, suburban and rural
districts throughout the United States, officials said.
   Criteria for awarding grants include: prospects for improving
student performance; a commitment to reform shared by parents,
teachers and the community as a whole; and a plan for sustaining
and expanding the program once it proves successful.
   With Gerstner as chairman, a 17-member board will determine how
the grants will be distributed. Board members include former
Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, now president of the University of
Tennessee; Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton; National Education
Association President Keith Geiger; New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean;
former Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin, now a visiting fellow at the
Urban Institute; and American Federation of Teachers President
Albert Shanker.

   Here is a chronology of events related
to the 19-month cease-fire that was canceled Wednesday by
Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Feb. 3, 1988 _ U.S. military aid to the Contras runs out as the
Sandinistas grapple with the worst economic crisis since their 1979
revolution.
   March 21, 1988 _ The Contras and the Sandinistas meet
face-to-face for the first time on Nicaraguan territory, signing an
accord in the border outpost of Sapoa, agreeing to a 60-day truce
and further talks. An unofficial truce goes into effect.
   April 1, 1988 _ The truce officially begins.
   July 1, 1988 _ The Sandinista government unilaterally renews the
truce for 30 days, setting a pattern that holds until Nov. 1, 1989,
despite scattered clashes. Contra leaders say they consider the
truce indefinite in any case.
   September 1988 _ Talks to turn the Sapoa agreement into a
lasting peace collapse. With U.S. non-lethal aid continuing, 12,000
Contra troops move out of Nicaragua into Honduran camps. Contra
field commanders say they consider the truce only a pause and
continue military training.
   Feb. 14, 1989 _ Ortega and the other Central American presidents
agree at a summit in El Salvador to devise a plan for disbanding
the rebels holed up in Honduran base camps. In exchange, Nicaragua
promises free and fair elections in 1990.
   April 18, 1989 _ President Bush signs a $49 million non-lethal
aid package for the Contras that runs through February 1990.
   Aug. 7, 1989 _ An agreement to disband and relocate the Contras

   The American Bar Association's decision to
give a key federal court nominee only a ``qualified'' rating could
bolster opposition to the nomination, a civil rights attorney said
today.
   The ABA's ``qualified'' rating given federal appellate court
nominee Clarence Thomas ``will stimulate some concern'' about the
nomination, said William Taylor, a Washington civil rights attorney.
   Thomas's seven-year tenure as chairman of the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission has drawn criticism from lawmakers and civil
rights groups who say he has undermined enforcement of age
discrimination laws.
   The ABA rating ``lends some credence to the concerns that some
of the advocacy groups have been voicing,'' said Taylor, an
official of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.
   The group successfully lobbied last summer against the
nomination of William Lucas to head the Justice Department's civil
rights division.
   Taylor said the coalition of civil rights groups has not taken a
formal position on the nomination, even though some organizations
already have expressed opposition individually.
   ``Now that the nomination has been made, the sentiment of the
various groups will crystallize,'' Taylor said.
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel on Tuesday played down
the rating of Thomas as ``qualified'' instead of ``well qualified''
to sit on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for Washington, a court
that takes on many of the nation's most heavily spotlighted cases.
   ``Anyone who is qualified is by definition an appropriate
nominee,'' Runkel said.
   But Thomas' supporters expressed anger about the rating.
   ``I know him to be an absolutely first-rate lawyer lawyer and
beyond that I know him to be a first-rate human being,'' Sen. John
Danforth, R-Mo., for whom Thomas once worked, said Tuesday.
   ``I am concerned about what I fear might happen to my friend
Clarence Thomas when he comes before the Senate Judiciary Committee
in his hearings,'' Danforth said on the Senate floor.
   Thomas ``has one thing going against him and that is that he is
a black lawyer of fairly conservative political and judicial
philosophy,'' Danforth said.
   ``The interest groups that did a job on William Lucas in the
Senate Judiciary Committee are going to be mobilizing again to do a
job on Clarence Thomas,'' Danforth said.
   The nomination of Lucas, a black Republican, to head of the
civil rights division of the Justice Department died in committee
this year because of concerns over his qualifications and
commitment to civil rights.
   On Tuesday, the Alliance for Justice and 21 other civil rights
groups wrote Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden
Jr., D-Del., to urge a careful investigation of Thomas' record at
EEOC.
   ``It is his actions as head of the EEOC which suggest that he
lacks the commitment to equal justice, the qualifications and the
judicial temperament for a lifetime appointment to one of the
nation's most important courts,'' said the letter.
   The ABA report card on Thomas also revived the debate over the
group's role in screening judicial candidates, which conservatives
say is heavily skewed by the panel's alleged liberal bias.
   ``The ABA has no legitimate role in judicial selection,'' said
Patrick McGuigan, senior scholar at the Free Congress Foundation's
Center for law and Democracy. ``The fact they gave a man like
Clarence Thomas a `qualified' instead of a `well qualified' is just
further evidence.''
   McGuigan noted ``roughly half'' of federal judicial nominees
have received the ``qualified'' rating from the 15-member ABA panel.
   According to the ABA's judicial screening handbook, a
``qualified'' rating means that the nominee meets minimum
qualifications for satisfactory performance as a judge.
   To be rated ``well qualified,'' a nominee ``must have the
committee's strong affirmative endorsement ... and be regarded as
one of the best available for the vacancy from the standpoint of
integrity, competence and temperament,'' the handbook said.
   ``The evaluation of qualified indicates that it appears the
prospective nominee would be able to perform satisfactorily as a
federal judge with respect to integrity, competence and
temperament,'' according to the handbook.

<TEXT>
   A group of retailing and publishing giants has sued
a religious organization, accusing it of using racketeering and
extortion to suppress the sale of adult magazines.
   Playboy and Waldenbooks were among those who filed the
racketeering suit against the Florida chapter of the American
Family Association.
   ``What they're doing goes far beyond rights of free speech,''
said Robert O'Donnell, Playboy Publishing Group's vice president of
retail marketing and sales. ``They're going beyond legal bounds.''
   AFA has picketed and threatened to boycott stores that carried
the targeted magazines. The publishing interests decided to sue
after the association distributed a letter in September to store
operators and corporate officers.
   The letter told the stores they were violating Florida's
obscenity statute by selling adult magazines and promised to name
those stores as violators and demand enforcement.
   The plaintiffs said the statute applies only to publishers, and
that the AFA was using the letter to harass retailers and their
customers. The AFA acknowledged in a news release that was included
in the lawsuit that the pornography statute applies only to
publishers.
   AFA has ``maliciously persisted in a pattern of racketeering
activity intended to coerce plaintiffs ... and others from
purchasing, selling or distributing magazines denominated sexually
explicit by them,'' the suit said.
   The suit said one major chain and about 1,400 convenience stores
``have acceded to defendants' extortion and ceased distributing
various publications.''
   The suit demands an end to interference, as well as triple
damages. No figures were given.
   A call to the association's state headquarters in Tampa reached
a recording saying only that a Wednesday news conference at which
the group planned to name alleged violators of the obscenity law
had been canceled. A home number for Florida leader David Caton was
unlisted.
   Forrest Ann Daniels, a spokeswoman at the association's national
office in Tupelo, Miss., said any comment would have to come from
the Florida chapter.
   For years, the AFA has campaigned against the sale of magazines
such as Penthouse and Playboy. The association, which has also
backed boycotts of TV programs it considers offensive, most
recently persuaded Matchbox to cancel sale of a Freddy Krueger
doll, based on the ghoulish killer in ``Nightmare on Elm Street''
movies.
   Americans for Consitutional Freedom, an anti-censorship group
formed by publishing trade associations, supported the lawsuit to
uphold what it called constitutionally protected publications.
   ``These types simply don't believe in freedom of choice,'' said
Oren Teicher, the group's executive director. ``If they dislike a
TV show or a magazine, they want to drive it out of the market.
That's un-American, and we're going to stop them.''

   Hundreds of East Germans fled to Czechoslovakia
today after the government lifted travel restrictions, and a top
Communist official for the first time said the future of the Berlin
Wall could be open to discussion.
   Also, East German officials acknowledged that the country's
rigidly planned economy is in serious trouble and that sweeping
reform may be on the way.
   East Germany today lifted restrictions that had barred most
travel to Czechoslovakia since Oct. 3. Former Communist Party
leader Erich Honecker imposed the ban to stem the flow of thousands
of refugees fleeing West through West Germany's embassy in Prague,
Czechoslovakia.
   New party leader Egon Krenz rescinded the ban and has also
hinted that a new law giving East Germans greater travel freedom
would be studied. Czechoslovakia is the only country East Germans
can visit without permission.
   Hours after the ban was lifted, more than 200 East Germans
arrived at the West German compound in Prague.
   Earlier, Communist authorities in East Berlin agreed to issue
documents allowing East Germans in the West German Embassy to
travel West. A similar arrangement is under way in Poland.
   In Moscow, Krenz ruled out the idea of tearing down the Berlin
Wall as well as the possibility of reuniting the two Germanys.
   But in Kiel, West Germany, a Communist official for the first
time publicly said the government may be willing to relax its view
on the need for the Wall.
   The opening of borders in other Soviet bloc countries was making
the Berlin Wall's significance ``limited and illusory,'' said
Johannes Chemnitzer, the top-ranking Communist in Neubrandenburg.
   Replying to a question about whether that meant the future of
the Berlin Wall is now open to discussion, Chemnitzer replied:
``Surely.''
   Krenz held talks this week in Moscow with Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev to discuss possible reforms in East Germany.
   Krenz said he and Gorbachev reached ``total agreement on all
questions that we discussed,'' and said many of the pro-democracy
demonstrators in East Germany's streets were showing their support
for ``the renovation of socialism.
   ``In this sense I consider this a very good sign,'' he said.
   On another topic, Guenter Schabowski, a member of the
policy-making Communist Party Politburo, told a West German
magazine the government must lift a wide range of subsidies on
goods and services.
   ``We subsidize even flowers and taxi fares. That's an impossible
situation,'' Schabowski was quoted as saying.
   Schabowski, in the interview published today with the magazine
Wirtschaftswoche, or Economy Week, was quoted as saying the
leadership also was considering an overhaul of the country's
industry.
   Schabowski said the leadership would examine whether the
organization of industry into huge ``combines'' still makes
economic sense.
   The exodus of tens of thousands of East Germans has added to the
mounting problems for the nation's industry, while continuing
protests have increased pressure on the government to institute
reform.
   For years, the East Germany's Communist leadership has spoken of
its economic system as an unqualified success. Although the
country's standard of living has been the envy of many of its
Soviet bloc allies, ordinary citizens still have to deal with many
hardships.
   Quality consumer goods are in short supply and buying a car can
take 10 years.
   A top manager told an East German newspaper that food and
consumer goods supplies were falling far below the expectations of
a dissatisfied population.
   Heinz Warzecha, director of the machine tools combine named
``October 7,'' told the East Berlin newspaper Berliner Zeitung that
more openness was needed in the way the economy was run and that
such problems as inflation must be publicized.
   ``The level of food supplies, consumer goods and services in
many areas does not meet the expectations that citizens of one of
the 10 leading industrial nations have the right to expect,''
Warzecha told the government-controlled newspaper in today's
edition.
   ``Whether we like it or not, the people are comparing us with
West Germany and other capitalist countries,'' he added.
   Warzecha said salaries should be linked to performance,
asserting that ``whoever produces more deserves better pay.''
   The Communist Party newspaper Neues Deutschland, in a front-page
article today, also spoke of a lack of raw materials and workers in
a machine took factory in Goerlitz.
   Nearly 70,000 East Germans have fled to West Germany in recent
months, and many are skilled, young workers.
   West Germany's ARD television reported the opposition group
Democratic Awakening has demanded a major change in East Germany's
legal system.
   ARD said the group has demanded the formation of a
constitutional court, so that ``every citizen has the right to have
the legal and constitutional basis of government decisions
reviewed'' in court.

   John F. Kennedy Jr. has failed his first attempt
at passing the state bar examination, a newspaper reported today.
   The 28-year-old son of the slain president failed the test in
July when about 7,000 people took the exam, according to
unidentified sources quoted by New York Newsday.
   About 70 percent passed, according to the New York Law Journal.
   Kennedy's sister, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, 31, was notified
in May that she passed the exam in February, on her first try.
   But cousin Robert F. Kennedy Jr. failed the bar exam in 1983 the
first time he took it. He passed it later and was admitted to the
New York bar in 1985.
   John Jr. is an assistant district attorney in the office of
Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau, earning $30,000 a
year. Under office policy, he can take the exam twice more before
being asked to resign if he fails to pass.
   Under court rules, he can work as an unadmitted lawyer on
misdemeanor cases and, under the supervision of a member of the
bar, on certain state Supreme Court matters. State Supreme Court is
the trial-level court.
   Gerald McKelvey, a spokesman for the district attorney, said
Kennedy is assigned to special prosecutions, where he handles a
variety of cases including consumer fraud. McKelvey declined
comment about Kennedy's bar exam. Kennedy did not return telephone
calls, Newsday said.
   Kennedy is a graduate of New York University law school and has
been working in the district attorney's office since August.

<TEXT>
   A man so skilled at burglary that he once
made training videotapes for police has been implicated in more
than 1,000 Florida break-ins in which at least a half-million
dollars in gold and gems were stolen.
   Richard Makofski, 35, is charged in a fugitive warrant with
dealing in property stolen in the past nine months, said Palm
Beach, Fla., Detective Rob Hawkins. Howard County, Md., police
arrested Makofski on Sunday at his home.
   Hawkins said 12{ pounds of gold ingots were seized from
Makofski. The gold came from stolen jewelry that had been melted
down, Hawkins said.
   Makofski was convicted of burglary in Maryland in 1985, and
police said then he had been linked to 63 local burglaries. He was
sentenced to three years in jail.
   At the time, county police were so amazed by his skill that they
asked Makofski to teach a class at the Police Academy on how to
detect burglars. He also made a videotape for detectives on methods
of burglary.
   A search of Makofski's home revealed books and tapes on
burglaries, and electronic equipment and tools, said Howard County
detectives.
   Makofski has been linked by the Palm Beach County, Fla.,
sheriff's office to a group of at least four people who committed
as many as five to six burglaries daily at apartments in the three
Florida counties, Hawkins said.
   The detective said the burglars picked locks on the front doors,
and plundered the apartments while a lookout waited in a car
outside with a two-way radio.
   A 50-year-old man and his 28-year-old son, both Florida
residents, have also been arrested in connection with the
burglaries, he said. Many of the burglaries were performed by gang
members to support drug habits, Hawkins said.
   ``They knew the value of what they were taking,'' he said.
``They had gold-testing equipment and even a melting pot to melt
down the jewelry.''
   Hawkins said Makofski has agreed to waive extradition and return
to Florida.

   A top federal health official said today he
intends to extend indefinitely the current ban on federal funding
for research using fetal tissue from induced abortions.
   James Mason, assistant secretary for health at the Department of
Health and Human Services, said he has the authority to make a
decision on the ban and ``the moratorium should be continued
indefinitely.''
   Permitting federal funding for such research, he said, ``would
be unacceptable federal policy.''
   Conservative supporters of the Bush administration have promised
a firestorm of protest if the administration lifts the ban.
   Mason's predecessor as assistant secretary for health, Robert
Windom, last year forbade use of government funds to finance such
research and established a special adivsory committee on whether it
should continue.
   Later last year, the committee recommended the ban be lifted.
   ``I have a vast array of authority,'' Mason told reporters, but
would not make the decision without consulting Health and Human
Services Secretary Louis Sullivan. ``We're in that process right
now,'' he said.
   Mason told reporters he would write a letter to the National
Institutes of Health within 10 days informing it of his decision.
   ``This is a moral issue,'' he said. ``I'm concerned that in
sponsoring fetal tissue transplantation there will be a clear
perception that the government is encouraging or promoting
abortion.''
   Many scientists believe Parkinson's Disease and other conditions
could be treated by transplanting fetal tissue into patients.
   Allowing federal funding for fetal tissue transplants from
induced abortions would create a demand for aborted fetuses, which
would increase the number of abortions, Mason said.
   He said he believes there are other ways that science can
approach treatment for these diseases, including the use of fetal
tissue from spontaneous abortions, which are not now included in
the ban. He also said research using fetal tissue from induced
abortions could be conducted without federal funds.

   The Bush administration today condemned as
``deplorable'' Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega's suspension of
the cease-fire with the Contras, but steered clear of calling for
renewing military aid to the anti-Sandinista rebels.
   ``We don't want to go that route. We want to get free elections.
We want the Tela agreement to be carried out,'' White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said at a briefing.
   ``We just don't think it's helpful to speculate on actions
beyond that,'' Fitzwater said.
   Ortega today ended the 19-month-old cease-fire and threatened at
a news conference in Managua to cancel elections scheduled next
year. He accused Bush of ``supporting terrorism in Nicaragua.''
   ``His deplorable action, which was foreshadowed during the Costa
Rican celebration of democracy, is an affront to the hemisphere and
the democratic traditions we hold so important,'' Fitzwater said.
   He said it demonstrated that the Nicaraguan government
``continues to swim against the tide'' of democracy in the region.
   It is ``obvious that (Ortega) is afraid of the ballot box,''
Fitzwater said.
   ``It's important that the world understand our emphasis is on
the elections and the democratic processes in Nicaragua, so we
continue to push for that,'' said Fitzwater. ``If Mr. Ortega wants
to pursue a military conflict, if he wants to re-open war, if he
wants to resume the killing again, that is his business.''
   ``Our purpose is to try to get the peace process back on
track,'' said Fitzwater. He said President Bush has been in contact
with other leaders in the hemisphere. He declined to name them.
   Pressed on whether the administration might consider asking
Congress anew to re-arm the rebels, Fitzwater said, ``We are
evaluating the entire situation, but we do not think it's
appropriate to speculate on military assistance.''
   He said the United States has no advice now for the Contras on
how they should conduct themselves.
   Vice President Dan Quayle, meeting separately with Afghan
resistance leaders, was also asked by reporters if the
administration had advised the Contras not to fight. ``We have made
our position very clear on the matter that we support the
cease-fire. ... '' Quayle said. ``We do not want violence. We want
peace.''
   ``Over the past decade, our hemisphere has witnessed a
tremendous growth of democracy. Unfortunately, the Nicaraguan
government continues to swim against the tide,'' Fitzwater said.
``The Sandinista unwillingness to negotiate with the Democratic
opposition, its military harrassment in the country, and now its
unilateral breaking of the cease-fire confirm President Ortega's
desire to maintain power at all costs and at the expense of the
wishes of the Nicaraguan people.
   ``One can only assume that his actions are being taken to thwart
the democratic opposition as the elections draw near. It is obvious
that he's afraid of the ballot box,'' Fitzwater said.
   When Bush was asked Tuesday about the possibility of renewed
military aid to the Contras, he told a news conference, ``I would
re-evaluate this situation in a minute if the cease-fire is
broken.''
   The Sandinista leader shocked a meeting of Western hemisphere
leaders in San Jose, Costa Rica, last Friday with his announcement
that he planned to call off the 19-month cease-fire because of
``savage attacks'' inside Nicaragua by the Contra rebels.
   A unanimous U.S. Senate on Tuesday condemned Ortega's plan to
end the cease-fire.
   A strongly worded resolution, approved 95-0, demanded that
Ortega renew his commitment to the cease-fire and conduct elections
scheduled for Feb. 25 in a free, fair and open manner.
   It expressed concern that Ortega's cancellation of the
cease-fire ``could be a prelude to a Sandinista effort to cancel or
postpone the elections.''
   ``Even Ortega's strongest apologists in Congress are having a
hard time coming up with excuses for this one,'' said Senate
Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas, referring to the declaration
made by Ortega that he would end the cease-fire because of alleged
violations by the Contras.

<TEXT>
   Nine sailors were injured by smoke inhalation
and one also suffered burns in a fire aboard the oiler USS
Monongahela in the eastern Atlantic today, the Navy reported.
   The fire, which broke out in one of the ship's two boilers, was
extinguished, but the vessel is ``dead in the water,'' said Navy
spokesman Lt. Bruce Cole. The ship was reported 500 miles west of
Gibraltar.
   The incident was another in a string of incidents that have
afflicted Navy ships during the past week, including the accidental
bombing of a warship and the loss of sailors swept off aircraft
carriers.
   Cole said that of the nine Monongahela sailors injured, eight
were treated on board ship for smoke inhalation while the other was
transported to the USS Shenandoah, a destroyer tender, for
treatment of burn injuries that were described as not serious.
   The spokesman said sailors were attempting to start up the
second boiler so that the ship could be returned to its closest
port.
   Cole said that if the ship's boilers are not able to propel the
ship on its own power arrangements would be made for it to be towed
into port.
   Ships of the Cimarron class such as the Monongahela normally
carry a crew 12 officers and 205 enlisted men, according to the
reference work Jane's Fighting Ships. The ship is 592 feet long and
displaces 26,110 tons when fully loaded.

   President Bush today named former University
of Nebraska President Ronald Roskens to be head of the Agency for
International Development.
   Roskens, 56, would succeed the late M. Alan Woods as
administrator of the agency responsible for U.S. economic and
foreign assistance programs in more than 60 countries worldwide.
   The post, which requires Senate confirmation, has been vacant
since Woods, 63, died of cancer in June.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater announced Roskens'
nomination at his daily news briefing.
   As is customary, the White House said Bush ``announced his
intention to nominate'' Roskens to the post. The nomination will be
forwarded to the Senate later after an FBI background check.
   Roskens became president emeritus of the University of Nebraska
in Lincoln earlier this year after 12 years as president of the
University of Nebraska system. The state Board of Regents
terminated his contract July 31 for unspecified reasons.
   Roskens, a native of Iowa, served as a vice president at Kent
State University in Ohio before coming to Nebraska as chancellor of
the University of Nebraska at Omaha in 1972. In 1977, he became
president of the system, which now includes three institutions,
40,000 students and a budget of nearly $700 million.
   Roskens is a past chairman of the American Council for
Education, the main lobbying arm in Washington for the nation's
more than 3,000 colleges and universities.
   The Omaha World-Herald reported in today's edition that Bush was
naming Roskens to run the international agency.
   While chancellor at the Omaha campus, Roskens engineered a
contract with AID to fund an exchange program with the University
of Kabul in Afghanistan.
   Later, while system president, he oversaw campus initiatives for
AID contracts that included a $30 million project by the Omaha
campus to provide educational support for children in Afghanistan
and Afghan refugees in Pakistan.
   As university president, Roskens was paid $112,000 a year plus
fringe benefits.
   As part of Roskens' termination, the Board of Regents agreed to
pay his full salary and fringe benefits until his contract expires
June 30, 1991. The university, however, will deduct whatever salary
and benefits Roskens receives after June 30, 1990, from other
posts. The AID job pays roughly $80,000 a year.

<TEXT>
   Leftist rebels said today that
the slayings of 10 union activists could endanger planned peace
talks with the government.
   A general strike called to protest the slayings had little
effect on the capital, however. Public transportation and business
was normal despite the strike call Tuesday by the National
Federation of Salvadoran Workers, also known as Fenastras.
   A homemade bomb at Fenastras headquarters on Tuesday killed 10
people and wounded 29. The attack came a day after leftist rebels
bombarded the Defense Ministry compound with mortars, killing one
person and wounding 15.
   President Alfredo Cristiani, addressing the nation Tuesday
night, cautioned that ``these deeds could signify an escalation of
terrorist violence in our country.''
   Fenastras in a communique said ``from now on all workers are at
war'' with the right-wing government led by the Republican
Nationalist Alliance, known as Arena.
   In another statement, the leftist Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front guerrillas blamed the army for the massacre at the
union hall, adding the attack ``endangers'' a meeting for peace
talks with the government to be held in Caracas, Venezuela, for
Nov. 20.
   Government and army spokesmen routinely characterize Fenastras
and Comadres _ the Committee of Mothers of Political Prisoners,
Disappeared and Assassinated of El Salvador _ as fronts for leftist
guerrillas.
   Two Americans, Mark Anner of Greenwich, Conn., and Brenda
Hubbard of Los Angeles, were injured in the attacks. Anner was
wounded at Fenastras and Miss Hubbard at the Comadres office.
   Hubbard and Anner are so-called ``solidarity workers,'' members
of North American and European organizations that work with local
leftists in the belief that the presence of foreigners makes
official repression less likely.
   ``We the workers see more clearly than ever that we are at war
against Arena,'' the rightist governing party, said Humberto
Centeno of the National Union of Salvadoran Workers, the country's
largest labor federation.
   The government of Cristiani, whose party has in the past been
linked to death squad activity, said it ``energetically condemns
the terrorist acts against Comadres and Fenastras.''
   It called the attacks, as well as Monday's guerrilla mortar
assault on the Defense Ministry, ``part of a conspiratorial plan
whose goal is to create obstacles to the process of dialogue.''
   Government and guerrilla representatives have met twice since
September in an effort to find a way to end the 10-year-old civil
war. The two sides, far apart, have been able to agree only to
continue talks in Venezuela on Nov. 20.
   The government said the bombings were being investigated, and
that it would not allow escalating violence to knock the peace
process off track.
   ``We should not lose our serenity and the hope of finding a
solution to the conflict by civilized means,'' it said in a
communique.
   The blast at Fenastras virtually destroyed the two-story
building in the center of the downtown area just two blocks from
the National Police barracks. Six people were killed immediately,
and four died later Tuesday in the hospital.
   One of those killed was Febe Velasquez, a leading figure in
Fenastras. The union's secretary-general, Gerardo Diaz, was among
the wounded.
   Fenastras was attacked Sept. 5 with an anti-tank rocket that
damaged the building's facade but caused no casualties.
   Tuesday's bombings came a day after leftist rebels attacked the
Defense Ministry and headquarters of the joint chiefs of staff with
homemade mortars, killing one person and wounding 15.
   ``This is a response to the attack on the Joint Chiefs,'' Hector
Recinos, a member of the directorate of Fenastras, told journalists
at the news conference.
   The armed forces press committee, in a communique, rejected the
accusation and condemned the bomb attacks as terrorism.
   Ruben Zamora, one of the country's top leftist politicians,
condemned the Fenastras bombing as ``part of a wave of attacks
against all democratic and progressive forces in El Salvador.''
   Zamora's house was bombed before dawn on Oct. 19, slightly
wounding two of his bodyguards. Two days earlier, while peace talks
were being held in Costa Rica, gunmen killed the 23-year-old
daughter of an army colonel.
   The government and armed forces blamed the rebels, who denied
any responsibility in the slaying.

<HEAD>Panel Recommends Building One Interim Dump For Nuclear Waste</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government should build one
central site to store radioactive waste from nuclear power plants
until a permanent dump is ready to operate early in the 21st
century, a panel told Congress today.
   The recommendation by a congressionally ordered study group is
expected to revive a national debate over whether a temporary
storage site is necessary and safe, as well as where it would be
situated and who would pay the bill.
   The panel, which studied the issue for 18 months, recommended
that Congress authorize the construction of a temporary waste dump
capable of holding 5,000 metric tons of uranium, the fuel that
nuclear reactors use to make electricity.
   It said this would be enough to satisfy the nuclear utilities'
storage needs until the year 2006. The capital cost of the facility
was put at $500 million to $600 million.
   The panel said only those nuclear utilities that used the dump
should pay for its construction and operation.
   The Energy Department in 1987 proposed building as soon as
possible a temporary storage facility near Oak Ridge, Tenn. Later
that year, however, Congress annulled the proposal and created the
review commission to report on the need for interim storage.
   The panel is known as the Monitored Retreivable Storage Review
Commission.
   Tennessee is opposed to being the site of an interim waste dump.
The review commission did not recommend a specific site for the
dump but said it expected the siting question to be a major public
issue.
   About 20,000 metric tons of spent, or used, nuclear fuel have
accumulated at nuclear plants around the country since the start of
commercial nuclear power in the 1960s.
   Even if no more nuclear reactors were built in this country,
spent fuel from existing reactors is projected to reach 87,000 tons
by the time their licenses expire.
   Congress in 1987 ordered the Energy Department to study the
feasibility of building a permanent dump for the nuclear wastes at
Yucca Mountain in Nevada, but a series of technical and political
problems have delayed that project. The department still says the
permanent dump could open as soon as 2003, but the storage review
commission said it believed further delays were likely.
   In light of the Yucca Mountain delays, the panel recommended
building a Federal Emergency Storage facility capable of holding up
to 2,000 metric tons of uranium. Its purpose would be as a ``safety
net'' of storage capacity for emergency purposes such as an
accident at a nuclear power plant. The panel said it should be paid
for by all utilities that operate nuclear reactors.
   The 1987 law, known as the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act,
also authorized the construction of an interim storage facility but
said construction could not start until a license had been issued
for the permanent dump.
   The linkage was designed to avoid the possibility _ often cited
by critics of the interim facility _ that continuing delays in
building the permanent dump could, in effect, mean waste at the
temporary site would stay there indefinitely.

   President Bush today announced his selection
of Dr. Antonia Novello, a pediatrician and deputy director of the
government's National Institute of Child Health, to be surgeon
general. She would be the first woman to hold the post.
   If confirmed by the Senate, she would succeed C. Everett Koop,
the outspoken pediatric surgeon who stepped down in September after
seven years as the nation's chief public health officer.
   A native of Puerto Rico, Novello, 45, is a pediatric kidney
specialist.
   She graduated from the University of Puerto Rico and in 1970
from the university's medical school in the top 5 percent of her
class.
   Novello joined the National Institute of Child Health and Human
Development in April 1986. She is its deputy director as well as
coordinator for AIDS research.
   Anti-abortion groups had closely monitored the process of
filling the surgeon general's post.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Novello shares
Bush's anti-abortion views _ opposition to abortions except to
protect the life of the mother or in cases of rape or incest; and
opposition of federal funding of abortions for poor women except
when the mother's life is in danger.
   ``Anybody who comes into a policymaking positon is asked if they
can support our policy,'' Fitzwater said.
   Novello was one of a number of women recommended for the job by
President Bush's personal physician, Burton J. Lee III, who said he
withdrew himself from consideration for the job because of his
pro-choice views in abortion.
   Novello worked for Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, in 1982-83, when he
was chairman of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee.
   She is married to a psychiatrist, Dr. Joe Novello, who hosted a
talk show on a Washington radio station offering advice for
troubled adolescents. Her brother-in-law is Don Novello, the
comedian better known as ``Father Guido Sarducci.''
   Novello has served on several government task forces studying
AIDS and on committees that dealt with women's health issues. She
also is a clinical professor of pediatrics at Georgetown University
and is a commissioned officer in the Public Health Service.

   Gunmen killed a Saudi Arabian embassy
employee in Moslem west Beirut today and the Iran-backed Islamic
Jihad, which holds at least two Americans hostage, claimed
responsibility for the assassination.
   The group said in a statement that it killed Mohammed Ali
Marzouqi, 42, the personnel officer at the Saudi embassy in
Damascus, Syria, to avenge the recent execution in Saudi Arabia of
16 Shiite Moslems convicted of terrorism.
   The typewritten statement in Arabic was accompanied by a picture
of American hostage Terry Anderson to prove its authenticity. They
were delivered to the offices of a Western news agency in Moslem
west Beirut.
   Police said Marzouqi was visiting the Moslem sector of the
Lebanese capital when he was killed.
   Islamic Jihad is among the pro-Iran Shiite Moslem groups in
Lebanon believed to be holding eight Americans hostage. Anderson,
chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, was
captured in Beirut on March 16, 1985, and is the longest-held
Western hostage.
   The Islamic Jihad statement said: ``A few weeks ago, the rulers
of Saudi Arabia, the servants of the devil, committed a massacre
against 16 Moslem pilgrims.''
   Marzouki, it added, was ``one of the most senior Saudi security
officers in Lebanon. His activities were not hidden from the eyes
of the Mujahedeen.'' Mujahedeen is Arabic for holy warriors.
   The 16 convicted terrorists were beheaded on Sept. 21. They were
all Shiite Moslem Kuwaitis convicted of bomb attacks in the holy
city of Mecca in July in which one Pakistani pilgrim was killed and
16 wounded.
   A Lebanese police spokesman said Marzouqi was climbing into a
grey embassy limousine in the Tallet Khayyat district at 9:30 a.m.,
when three gunmen opened up with submachine guns equipped with
silencers.
   ``Death was instantaneous,'' a police spokesman said.
   Marzouqi's driver, a Syrian, suffered a gunshot wound in the
hand, said the spokesman, who cannot be named under standing
regulations.
   Marzouqi was a frequent visitor to Beirut because he was in
charge of the affairs of the Lebanese employees of the Saudi
Embassy in Beirut, closed down since it was ransacked and burned by
pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem zealots in 1985.
   His assassination was preceded by a flurry of anonymous calls to
Western news agencies in recent weeks in which men claiming to
speak for pro-Iranian factions vowed to undermine a peace accord
worked out in Taif, Saudi Arabia.
   The Arab League-sponsored accord, aimed at ending Lebanon's
14-year-old civil war, was approved Oct. 22 by Lebanon's aging
parliamentary deputies.
   Because of the civil war, which has largely pitted Christian
against Moslem militias, the country has not held parliamentary
elections since 1972.
   Iran has openly rejected the peace accord, claiming it asserts
Christian hegemony over the Moslem majority in Lebanon.
   Police said a security committee in charge of overseeing a
cease-fire brokered by the Arab League was called to an emergency
meeting to discuss Marzouqi's assassination.
   Saudi embassy employees around the world have been the target of
assassins over the past year.
   On Oct. 16, Abdelrahman Shrewi, an embassy employee in Ankara,
Turkey lost his legs in a car bomb blast. Another Saudi diplomat
was killed there in an earlier attack.
   The Saudi prayer leader in a Brussels, Belgium mosque was
assassinated in March, and an Egyptian driver working in the Saudi
Embassy there was found murdered in June. An officer of the Saudi
Embassy in Thailand was killed in Bangkok in January.
   Pro-Iranian groups in Beirut claimed responsiblity for the
assassinations.
   Also today, a newspaper quoted Christian army commander Gen.
Michel Aoun as threatening to dissolve parliament to block the
election of a new president and saying he will punish the deputies
who approved the Taif accord.
   In an interview with the conservative Ad-Diyar newspaper, Aoun
said the deputies acted outside the Constitution when they approved
the accord.
   Aoun has rejected the peace plan, which was welcomed by most
Christian groups, because it did not include a specific timetable
for the withdrawal of 40,000 Syrian troops deployed in Lebanon
since 1976.
   The Syrian troops arrived under an Arab League peacekeeping
mandate but later sided with Moslem militias against the Christians.

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers
throughout the country:
   Oct. 30
   Fort Worth (Texas) Star-Telegram on financing former presidents:
   The next time members of Congress insist they are earnestly
trying to save money, taxpayers should ask them why they continue
to vote for outrageously generous stipends to ex-presidents.
   There is a certain amount of irony in the fact that the same
week that automatic spending cuts went into effect to conform to
the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction act, the House voted 383-30 to
give $1.8 million to four ex-presidents and one ex-president's
widow.
   The money is to cover pensions, office costs and other expenses.
When the $1.8 million is added to the $12.5 million that the Secret
Service will spend to provide security for former presidents and
their families, the price tag is sizable ...
   Rep. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., was on target in complaining that,
``This Congress should examine whether we are too great in our
largesse in providing services and costs to former presidents who
engage in personal income endeavors.''
   He was specifically referring to Ronald Reagan, who is to
receive $559,500 in pension and expense money to add to the $2
million he was paid by his Japanese sponsors to make two speeches
in Japan last week.
   ... That kind of expenditure is an absurd expense for a
government that is billions of dollars in debt. Former presidents
deserve a reasonable pension, but common sense should dictate that
what they are receiving now exceeds reasonable by a healthy amount.

   Oct. 26
   Philadelphia Daily News on the Reagans' trip to Japan:
   We were all taught about the presidents in grade school. Our
respect for the presidency came from the towering example set by
such great men as Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln and FDR, people of
intuitive dignity.
   Forget it. The role model our children are watching is Ronald
Reagan, shill.
   Reagan is stuffing his pockets with money, presumably his reward
for being entertainingly incompetent for eight years. Neither he
nor his loyal hangers-on see anything remotely strange or
inappropriate about his accepting $2 million for two 20-minute
speeches and a promotional tour for a Japanese entertainment
company specializing in quiz shows. ...
   It is easy to understand the Japanese affection for Reagan. He
is a charming old guy. Besides, his administration developed the
$50 billion annual trade deficit with Japan that has made so many
of his hosts even richer than his friends are. Gratitude is a
powerful force.
   Reagan makes money. So do his hosts. The only loser is the
United States.

   Sioux Falls (S.D.) Argus Leader on Nancy Reagan's book:
   The clatter over Nancy Reagan's book, ``My Turn,'' finally is
beginning to subside. Victims of the former first lady's criticism
are still returning verbal fire. But people _ the media, at least _
seem to be tiring of the nonsense ...
   Nancy may have settled some old scores, but it's costing her
some dignity ... Don Regan angered and embarrassed Nancy by
revealing in his book that the first lady consulted an astrologer
to help plan the president's schedule. Nancy strikes back by saying
that Regan often acted as if he were president ... Nancy admits
that she wanted Regan out, but she claims her role in forcing him
out was exaggerated ...
   It's interesting stuff, but it's so trivial. The book comes off
sounding like another chapter of soap-opera details from an
administration that already has been relegated to history ... With
due respect to the former first lady, we'll pass on buying her book.

   Spokane (Wash.) Chronicle on the line-item veto:
   Members of Congress tackle the job of creating spending bills
like children decorating a Christmas tree with ornaments. They pile
items on willy-nilly, and dare the others to touch their part of
the masterpiece. Then they show the president what they've wrought.
   President after president has wanted to trim the excess without
stripping the tree bare, but Congress has been adamant about
denying presidents that privilege. No changes are allowed; the tree
must be accepted as is or rejected entirely. ...
   Does the president have the right to pull a single item out of a
bill and veto it, sparing the remainder of the legislation, or is
it a right that must be conferred by Congress? Vice President Dan
Quayle suggested this week that President Bush thinks the answer
will never be clear until a president tries it, and said the
president reportedly is seeking a test case to give it a shot. By
mid-week Quayle was back-pedaling, but if Bush is contemplating the
idea, he has no reason to apologize for it. ...
   This argument over the president's authority to veto specific
line items will not be decided in Congress; it has languished there
for years, at least since the Grant administration. It is time to
let the courts have their say.

   The Daily Chronicle, Centralia, Wash., on Jim Bakker's sentence:
   Television evangelist Jim Bakker can count himself lucky that he
will have to spend only 10 years in federal prison before being
eligible for parole.
   Bakker, once one of the most influential televangelists in the
nation, was sentenced by U.S. District Court Judge Robert Potter to
a fitting 45 years in prison and fined $500,000 for defrauding his
faithful followers of millions of dollars to finance his luxury
homes, cars and vacations.
   Had Judge Potter strictly observed his reputation for severe
punishment, he could have sentenced Bakker to a maximum of 120
years and a fine of more than $5 million. Many of his disillusioned
flock would say he deserved the maximum.
   One of the most disturbing aspects of Bakker's sensational
six-week trial was his general lack of remorse. Although he
admitted he had sinned, he steadfastly maintained he had not
committed fraud.
   His insistence, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary,
that he was innocent of the 24 charges of swindling followers of
his Praise The Lord (PTL) ministry illustrates a moral bankruptcy
that offers little hope for rehabilitation.

<TEXT>
   Oct. 27
   West Central Tribune, Willmar, Minn., on Bakker's sentence:
   As much as we abhor the fraudulent ``ministry'' of Jimmy Bakker,
we think the sentence handed down upon his conviction was extremely
harsh for a non-violent crime. Forty-five years and a $500,000 fine
are far greater than sentences for many violent crimes.
   But in the long run, it will make Bakker a martyr. In a few
years, with time off for good behavior, he will be right back where
he was before, raking in money from his followers.
   While Bakker was guilty of fraud, a part of the blame should
rest with the people foolish enough to give him so much money.
Separating people from their money is the goal of every economic
venture. Most of the time, people get something in return.
   In Bakker's case, perhaps they were trying to buy their way into
heaven.

   Oct. 28
   Central Maine Morning Sentinel, Waterville, Maine, on Bakker's
sentence:
   Jim Bakker finally is behind bars where he will spend at least
10 years in the company of his kind of people _ thieves and
swindlers.
   The 45-year prison sentence and $500,000 fine handed down by
U.S. District Court Judge Robert Potter should send a clear message
to those who think fame and wealth will save them from a common
jail cell.
   Criminals are criminals, whether they are millionaire TV
evangelists, Wall Street wizards, or street-savvy cocaine dealers.
And it can be argued that the Jim Bakkers and Ivan Boeskys of the
world deserve the harsher punishments because they have the tools
to be immensely successful without breaking the law.

   Albuquerque (N.M.) Journal on accountability of the Federal
Reserve Board:
   Two Democratic members of the U.S. House of Representatives want
to extend political accountability to the Federal Reserve. That's a
quaint concept, ``political accountability,'' coming from an
institution where incumbents are virtually guaranteed re-election
until their dotage.
   Legislation sponsored by Reps. Lee Hamilton and Byron Dorgan
would open up operations of the Fed and make it more accountable _
and more responsive _ to Congress and the administration.
   Our statesmen in Washington might wield this new economic power
wisely. Or they might just let monetary policy flap in the
political winds like fiscal policy has in recent years as Congress
and presidents scrambled to serve parochial interests and special
constituencies.
   The legislative and executive branches play an enormous role in
the nation's economy already. Of course, neither is willing to
accept responsibility for the budget deficits that sap the economy.
   The proper reply to advocates of putting the Federal Reserve
under the thumb of Congress and the president: Get real.

   St. Petersburg (Fla.) Times on campaign contributions:
   The big lie of American politics is that hundreds of millions of
dollars in campaign contributions don't influence the politicians
who take them. Five senators who are up to their necks in the
savings and loan scandal might as well save their breath.
   The five brought heavy pressure on federal regulators to ease up
on Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Association of Irvine, Calif., which at
the time was hellbent for a $2.5 billion insolvency. ...
   Unlimited campaign spending has long since turned American
politics into a moral swamp, yet Congress seems to have been
waiting for some one big scandal to force it to act. That fragrant
package now sits on its doorstep, waiting only for the Senate
Ethics Committee to unwrap it.

   Kenosha (Wis.) News on gun deaths:
   The U.S. government's National Center for Health Statistics put
out a grim report the other day on the relationship between
firearms and young people.
   It said that about 11 percent of all deaths of youngsters aged 1
to 19 are gun-related.
   Most at risk are black male teen-agers. More than 40 percent of
deaths in that group during the period studied resulted from
shootings. The rate for white teen-agers was 16 percent.
   Louis Sullivan, secretary of the federal Department of Health
and Human Services, said the statistics show that ``we are losing
our youth, not only to disease, but increasingly to injury and
violence.''
   Imagine, one out of 10 Americans who die under the age of 20 are
shot to death, either accidentally or deliberately.
   Yet the National Rifle Association continues to mouth its
mindless slogan: ``Guns don't kill people, people kill people.''
Tell that to the parents of the approximately 3,400 youngsters who
die by the gun annually.
   Sullivan said in a statement accompanying the report: ``Just as
we have controlled so many childhood diseases, we must now mount an
equally aggressive campaign to rid our children's lives of the
causes and tools of injury and violence.'' Lawmakers would do well
to listen more to people like Sullivan and less to NRA officials,
who resist all government control of firearms.

   Evening Express, Portland, Maine, on acid rain:
   The world is getting used to surprising political initiatives by
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, even to the point of accepting
a back-seat role for the United States.
   Well, he did it again during a visit to Finland last week. Among
other things, Gorbachev signed an agreement to reduce sulfur
dioxide emissions from Soviet factories that are killing forests in
northern Finland.
   Canada would appreciate that sort of gesture from George Bush.
Sulfur dioxide is the main ingredient in acid rain. Eighty percent
of the air pollution afflicting this part of North America is
believed to come from coal-burning utilities and smelters in the
Midwest.
   Although this has been one of the principal concerns affecting
U.S.-Canadian relations for years, the White House has yet to patch
over the diplomatic damage inflicted by a Reagan administration
which largely refused even to admit the existence of a serious acid
rain problem ...

   The Providence (R.I.) Journal-Bulletin on the Soviets and
capitalism:
   Whether his goal is to change the Soviet system, or save it from
its various internal contradictions, Mikhail Gorbachev has been
asking a lot of American capitalists for advice these days, and
they are responding eagerly. From this dialogue has come, among
other things, a proposal to establish an American university in
Moscow, one aim of which would be to help communists become _ if
not capitalists, then some close relative. ...
   A school to promote Western economic values can only help. ...
Encouraging the spread of such enthusiasm _ from the
intelligentsia, which has long distrusted Marxism, to the
bureaucratic and managerial classes _ strikes us as a much better
way to encourage true reform than sending lots of cash to Moscow.

   The Times, Trenton, N.J., on President Bush's veto of abortion
bill:
   President Bush vetoed the massive Labor, Health and Human
Services spending bill _ blocking funding for AIDS research;
children's immunizations against crippling diseases; and dozens of
other important health initiatives.
   (He did it) because the bill contains a modest provision to pay
for abortions for ... the most vulnerable of American women _ those
suffering from the double brutality of poverty and rape or incest.
   Mr. Bush threatens to veto the foreign aid spending bill if it
reaches him with a Senate-passed amendment removing restrictions on
funding U.N. family planning programs. Those restrictions were
imposed under the Reagan administration at the behest of the
right-to-lifers, who claimed that the U.N. money supported forced
abortion policies in China. The Senate bill requires the U.S.
contribution be kept seperate from any funds spent in China _ (but
that's) not good enough for President Bush.
   Becasue of this incredible policy, the United State has withheld
birth control information and supplies from Third World countries,
where exploding populations make a mockery of all attempts to
provide food, shelter, education and jobs, and to protect the
environment. The poorest and most vulnerable who suffer directly,
but in this case all the world' people, in a few decades, will be
paying the price.
   The president's abdication on these issues is a disgrace.

   Dozens of cows have died and
hundreds of others are ill after eating lead-contaminated cattle
feed, the Agriculture Ministry said Wednesday.
   More than 300 dairy farms in the northern Netherlands, one of
the nation's prime agricultural areas, were affected, said ministry
spokesman Peter Stoel.
   The Health Ministry said there is no direct threat to public
health, noting that ``stringent measures have been taken to prevent
contaminated products from reaching the public.''
   Milk from affected farms is being handled separately by dairy
plants in the area, Stoel said. It is being processed into milk
powder that will remain ``outside distribution channels,'' he said,
adding that a decision on what will happen to the powder will be
made after its lead content has been established.
   The contamination, discovered two weeks ago, was traced to
cattle feed originating from a company in Strobos, Stoel said. It
was not clear how the contamination occurred.
   The fodder contained up to 1,500 micrograms of lead per 2.2
pounds, 300 times the maximum set by the European Economic
Community, said Stoel.

   A United Nations envoy met President Saddam
Hussein and senior officials Wednesday at the start of a new round
of shuttle diplomacy to try to get the deadlocked Iran-Iraq peace
talks moving.
   Jan Eliasson delivered a letter from U.N. Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar during the meeting, which Foreign Minister
Tariq Aziz also attended.
   The official Iraqi news agency quoted the Iraqi president as
telling Eliasson that Iraq is eager for peace while ``there is
nothing in Iran's record which testifies it is sincere in
accepting'' peace.
   The news agency earlier quoted Eliasson as saying on arrival
that his mission is aimed at ``encouraging the two countries to end
the no-war, no-peace situation.''
   He is expected to spend three weeks shuttling between Baghdad
and Tehran.
   Security Council Resolution 58 outlines a peace plan for the
eight-year war, but both sides have only accepted the cease-fire
that went into effect in August 1988. Peace talks that started with
the cease-fire stalled immediately.
   The issues that continue to hamper progress include exchange of
the 100,000 prisoners of war each side holds, withdrawel of troops
to borders both sides will agree on and control over the Shatt
Al-Arab waterway that forms the southern border between the two
countries.

   Most of the 1,100 U.S.
Army troops sent to St. Croix by President Bush six weeks ago to
maintain order in the aftermath of Hurricane Hugo will be replaced
by a smaller military police contingent, an official said Wednesday.
   Mark Wallace, a spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management
Agency office in Christiansted, said the troops were expecting
redeployment orders from the Pentagon this week.
   Gov. Alexander Farrelly had requested the bulk of the troops be
removed from the island, indicating the territorial government
feels they are no longer needed to maintain order, Wallace said.
   Bush sent the troops, most of them military police, to St. Croix
to re-establish law and order following widespread looting during
and after Hurricane Hugo, which struck the U.S. Virgin Islands on
Sept. 17.
   Wallace said the military contingent on St. Croix would be
phased out and replaced by ``a couple of hundred'' troops and a
National Guard MP unit. He said he did not know where the
replacement troops would be sent from.

<HEAD>Judge Rules Couple Abused Children, Supporter Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PLYMOUTH, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge ruled that a fundamentalist couple
who took to heart the Biblical admonition against sparing the rod
abused their children by spanking them with a stick and paddle, a
family supporter said today.
   The ruling, made in a closed-door juvenile proceeding that
raised the question of how far adults may go in disciplining their
children, endorsed social workers' decision to take the youngsters
from their parents in August.
   The parents, Stephen and JoAnn DeCosta of Rumney, still face
assault charges brought separately in a criminal indictment earlier
this year.
   Former Gov. Meldrim Thomson, who was called as a character
witness but never testified, said he learned that District Judge
Edwin Kelly ruled Tuesday that the DeCostas abused their 3-year-old
daughter and 7-year-old son.
   Thomson said the judge also ruled the couple abused their other
children, a 9-year-old son and a 14-year-old daughter.
   There was no immediate confirmation of the ruling. The ruling
means the children will remain in state custody for up to 18 months
unless the parents regain custody on appeal or the family is
reconciled through counseling.
   The state brought abuse charges against the parents after
spankings left the children's rear ends red and bruised,
authorities said.
   Court clerk Phil Tapply confirmed a decision was reached but
would not say what it was.
   Andrew McEvoy, the DeCostas' lawyer, declined to comment today,
citing a state law that prohibits talking about child abuse or
neglect cases.
   Mrs. DeCosta, citing the same statute, would not comment.
   The family's supporters maintain that the state is unjustly
penalizing the DeCostas because their religious beliefs dictate
that parents should use corporal punishment on their children. They
also say the statute barring discussion of the case is harming the
family by leaving it unable to answer rumors.
   Judy Bell, a lawyer for the Division of Children and Youth
Services, said earlier that such charges brought by the division
are ruled either ``founded'' or ``unfounded.'' State officials
would not discuss the decision.

<HEAD>Nixon Expresses U.S. Concern Over Political Repression</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Richard Nixon on Wednesday ended
five days of talks with top Chinese leaders in which he expressed
American concerns over political repression and suggested ways to
restore damaged China-U.S. ties.
   Nixon's trip had one immediate effect: rifle-toting police were
removed from outside the U.S. Embassy for the first time since the
bloody military crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in June.
   Nixon, on a private visit, will leave for home Thursday and will
send a report of his talks to President Bush next week, a member of
the Nixon entourage said.
   He is the most prominent American to come to China since the
crackdown.
   The Bush administration suspended all high-level official
contacts after the crackdown, and relations have reached one of
their lowest levels since Nixon reopened ties with China with his
dramatic 1972 visit to Beijing.
   Nixon's 20 hours of talks with senior leader Deng Xiaoping,
Premier Li Peng, Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin and others were
marked by blunt statements on both sides.
   The Nixon aide, who declined to be further identified, said
Nixon was successful in explaining ``in unminced fashion'' the
reasons for the strong U.S. reaction to the crackdown and in
assessing China-U.S. relations as seen by the Chinese.
   He also was able to engage the Chinese in a dialogue on the
Soviet Union, Indochina, Eastern Europe and other international
issues.
   Among the conclusions, the aide said, were that the Chinese want
to restore good relations but insist the initiative must come from
Washington, and that the Chinese are not yet willing to confront or
reassess the events of June.
   Deng, while agreeing that the two countries must put strategic
interests above ideological differences, accused the United States
of becoming ``involved too deeply'' in the pro-democracy
demonstrations. He said China was ``the real victim'' of the events
and ``it is unjust to reprove China.''
   Some Chinese leaders, the aide said, ``do see a resurrection of
the past,'' before 1972 when the United States tried to totally
isolate the Communist government in Beijing.
   Among the measures Nixon suggested the Chinese could take to
improve ties were restoration of the Fulbright program, attention
to human rights issues and the removal of police with automatic
rifles from the outside the U.S. Embassy.
   On Wednesday, for the first time in four months, police posted
outside the embassy compound were not armed with rifles in an
apparent gesture to the former president.
   However, harassment of embassy staff and visitors continued.
Several dozen uniformed policeman, plus at least 10 plainclothes
police, milled outside one of the embassy gates and shined a
spotlight into the compound.
   The police, armed with pistols, forced visitors to park hundreds
of yards away even though there were many empty spaces in front of
the embassy.
   Premier Li told Nixon the police were needed to guard against
escape by dissidents Fang Lizhi and his wife, Li Shuxian, who have
been hiding in the embassy since June.
   The Nixon aide, asked whether the subject of Fang came up in the
discussions, said only that there was hardly any issue that was not
taken up.
   Nixon, addressing hard-line President Yang Shangkun at a
banquet, noted that many Americans believe the military attack on
the student movement was ``excessive and unjustified.''
   But he said he was confident China-U.S. relations would survive
and prosper.
   ``Enemies do not have falling-outs. Enemies do not fear they are
being misunderstood. Only friends do,'' he said. ``As the
bitterness of the last few months recedes, and as our common
interests draw us together, our relationship will emerge stronger
than ever.''

   The first person to contract the AIDS virus in
China has been identified in Beijing, an official said Wednesday.
   The man was a former shop assistant in a Beijing food store who
had long been sexually promiscuous and had homosexual relations
with foreigners, said Cao Qing, vice director of the Department of
Epidemic Prevention in the Public Health Ministry.
   The man was detained for committing homosexual acts, a crime in
China, but left the country before it was confirmed he had the AIDS
virus, Cao said in an interview, declining to give the man's name
or whereabouts.
   ``This, in regard to our country of 1.1 billion people, is a
very dangerous signal,'' the Science and Technology Daily quoted
Cao as saying about the victim.
   One Chinese man died from the disease after contracting the
virus in the United States. Four people in Hangzhou _ one a
hemophiliac who later died from what the Chinese said were
unrelated causes _ tested positive for the AIDS virus after
transfusions with imported blood.
   But China says that none of the previous 25 cases of AIDS
infection, mostly involving foreigners, originated on the mainland.
   Despite the near non-existence of acquired immune deficiency
syndrome in China, authorities have raised a nationwide alarm about
the disase.
   All foreigners taking up residence in China must show proof that
they are AIDS-free and earlier this year legislation took effect
that gives health officials the right to test any Chinese deemed at
risk of contracting the killer disease.
   Imports of blood products have been banned and Chinese returning
from more than a year abroad must be tested for AIDS.
   The official press, television, movies and streetside billboards
have also linked AIDS to Western liberalism now being condemned by
China's conservative leaders, with the message going out that those
attracted to decadent Western ways run the risk of AIDS infection.
   A positive test for the AIDS virus detects the presence of AIDS
antibodies, meaning the person has been exposed to the virus. Those
carrying the virus could later develop AIDS.
   AIDS is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system,
leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer. It is spread
most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by
drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant
women to their offspring.

<HEAD>Latest Navy Accidents Leave Two Sailors Missing, Nine Injured</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NORFOLK, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A shipboard fire that injured nine sailors
in the Atlantic today extended to five the string of serious
accidents this week that have cost the Navy up to seven lives.
   Sailors were trying to start a boiler when it caught fire on the
oiler USS Monongahela in the eastern Atlantic, the Navy said. The
blaze disabled the ship. Nine sailors suffered smoke inhalation and
one also was burned, officials said.
   One sailor was missing in each of two incidents earlier this
week involving men overboard, and a plane crash aboard an aircraft
carrier on Sunday killed five people.
   Pentagon spokesman Fred Hoffman said he saw no connection
between the recent accidents. He said the Navy has an excellent
safety record.
   A wave swept three sailors and 38 missiles off the aircraft
carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower early Tuesday in the Atlantic
about 90 miles southeast of Cape Hatteras, N.C. The wave struck a
freight elevator as sailors moved missiles from one deck to
another, the Navy said.
   Late Monday, a sailor fell off the carrier USS Carl Vinson into
rough Pacific seas about 620 miles north of Wake Island, the Navy
said.
   Rescuers in a helicopter plucked one Eisenhower sailor from the
water; a second was rescued by boat. They were being treated aboard
ship, where one was in serious condition and the other in good
condition, the Navy said.
   ``It looks like they're both going to make it,'' said Lt. Paul
Jenkins, a Navy spokesman in Norfolk.
   Craig A. Harris, 22, of Uniontown, Pa., was missing from the
Eisenhower. Navy vessels and aircraft searched for him Tuesday
before giving up.
   There were no plans to salvage the missiles because they have
been ruined by the salt water, said Lt. Cmdr. Mike John, a
spokesman for the Atlantic Fleet's air command. He said he had no
information on their value.
   The 18 Sparrow and 20 Sidewinder missiles swept off the ship
were not nuclear-powered, said an Atlantic Fleet spokeswoman,
Senior Chief Petty Officer Cindy Adams. ``Therefore, they're
harmless,'' she said.
   On the Vinson, a sailor fell into the sea while the carrier cut
through 12-foot swells while returning to its home port at the
Alameda Naval Air Station near San Francisco after taking part in
exercises.
   The Navy searched choppy waters by air and sea Tuesday for the
sailor, whose name was not released.
   On Sunday, a pilot making his first landing on a carrier crashed
on the USS Lexington in the Gulf of Mexico, killing him and four
people on the ship. A videotape of the crash will not be made
public because it is part of the investigation, the Pentagon said.
   On Monday, a pilot accidentally dropped a bomb on the guided
missile cruiser USS Reeves in the Indian Ocean, injuring five
sailors.
   A Navy spokesman at the Pentagon, Lt. Bruce Cole, said the pilot
apparently mistook lights from the Reeves for flares marking
barrels in the water that were to be used as bombing targets in a
nighttime weapons training exercise.
   The worst Navy accident this year was the explosion in a turret
of the battleship USS Iowa in April. The blast killed 47 sailors.
   Before the most recent accidents, sailors had fallen or been
swept off Navy ships at least four times during the past five
months. At least four sailors were killed.

   Here are some facts and figures on Iran:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   LAND: Strategically situated between the Soviet Union and the
oil-rich Persian Gulf, Iran is slightly larger than Alaska. It is
ringed by mountains, and its center is largely desert covering an
area the size of France.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   PEOPLE: Most of Iran's 50 million people adhere to the Shiite
branch of Islam. Ethnic Persians make up the majority, but Iran has
significant minorities of Kurds, Arabs, Turkomans and Baluchis. Two
million Iranians were displaced by the 1980-88 war with Iraq.
Another 2 million have fled abroad since the 1979 revolution.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ECONOMY: Long a leading oil producer, Iran has estimated
reserves of 100 billion barrels. The conflict with Iraq drove
revenues down from a prewar $18 billion a year in 1979 to as low as
$6 billion in recent years. Iran also has the world's
second-biggest natural gas deposits.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY: The Qajar dynasty, last in a succession of Persian
monarchies, was overthrown by military leader Reza Khan in 1925.
His son, the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, ascended the throne
in 1941 and was toppled in 1979 in an Islamic revolution that
dramatically altered the geopolitical map of the oil-rich Gulf
region.
   The seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran by Iranian militants
in November 1979 led to a break in U.S. relations. Iraq invaded
Iran on Sept. 22, 1980. After initial defeats, the Iranians pushed
the Iraqis out. They later seized chunks of Iraq, but lost them in
a string of 1988 defeats and were forced to accept a United Nations
cease-fire that ended one of the century's longest conflicts.

<TEXT>
   POLITICAL STRUCTURE: As an Islamic republic, Iran's national
life closely follows guidelines set down in the Koran. It has an
elected parliament, or Majlis, but ultimate decision-making rests
in the hands of the small group of clerics. Hashemi Rafsanjani was
elected president in July. The post of prime minister has been
scrapped. Iran's supreme religious leader is Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, an ex-president who succeeded Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, the revolutionary patriarch who died last June 3.

<HEAD>Defense Orders Keep Overall Factory Orders from Falling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Orders to U.S. factories for manufactured
goods remained flat last month, but would have fallen had it not
been for the second largest increase in defense orders in history,
the government reported Wednesday.
   Analysts viewed the report as another sign of weakness in the
manufacturing sector, which will produce in continued sluggishness
in the overall economy in the months ahead.
   The Commerce Department said orders for both durable and
non-durable manufactured goods totaled a seasonally adjusted $236.7
billion in September. That included a 59.6 percent gain in defense
orders, to $12.7 billion, the largest advance in that category
since a record 68.3 percent advance in June 1988.
   Without the defense factor, orders actually declined 2.1
percent, the department said.
   ``It continues to show sluggishness in the manufacturing
sector,'' economist David Berson of the Federal National Mortgage
Association said of the report. ``I think we'll see it pretty flat
for a while.''
   Berson pointed to the second consecutive drop in non-defense
capital goods as an indication of things to come.
   Those orders, a barometer of business investment plans, were off
5.2 percent after dropping 10.4 percent in August.
   The economy, particularly the manufacturing and housing sectors,
have been hit hardest by high interest rates as the Federal Reserve
tightened credit in its attempt to slow inflation.
   Underlining that, the Commerce Department also reported
Wednesday that construction spending was unchanged in September
after a 1.5 percent spurt in August. But it, too, was propped up by
a 4.3 percent increase in public construction.
   Factory inventories posted their first decline since February
1987, but that was a fractional 0.1 percent fall to $371.2 billion.
If inventories increase without a corresponding gain in new orders,
it could signal production cutbacks in the future as factories
attempt to get rid of goods on shelves and backlots.
   Shipments of manufactured goods fell 1.6 percent to $234.4
billion.
   Orders for durable goods _ big-ticket items expected to last
more than three years _ rose 0.2 percent to $127 billion, boosted
by a 7.2 percent increase in electrical machinery to $20.8 billion.
   Primary metals orders were up 0.9 percent to $11.4 billion.
   But non-electrical machinery orders, including computers, were
off 0.7 percent to $22.5 billion.
   Transportation equipment orders, on the other hand, fell 4.7
percent to $34.8 billion as declines in autos and non-military
aircraft more than offset gains in military aircraft orders.
   Without the drop in transportation, total orders would have
risen 0.8 percent.
   Orders for non-durable goods were down 0.3 percent to $109.7
billion, led by a decline in food products.
   Total orders for the first nine months were 7.5 percent over
those of the same period a year earlier.

   The government today said it put
troops on alert because hundreds of Namibian guerrillas reportedly
crossed into Namibia from Angola in the past week.
   Foreign Minister Pik Botha said his country is prepared to act
even if it delays next week's U.N.-supervised elections that are a
step toward Namibian independence from South Africa, its southern
neighbor.
   Guerrilla leaders accused Botha of trying to sabotage the
election by making false allegations.
   Botha told a news conference that Foreign Affairs personnel
intercepted messages from U.N. soldiers referring to the
infiltration from Angola of more than 600 guerrillas of the
South-West Africa People's Organization between Oct. 23 and Oct. 31.
   SWAPO's secretary-general, Andimba Toivo ja Toivo, denied
Botha's assertion, saying it was ``'a concoction by the South
African government in a bid to sabotage the election.''
   ``It is well-known that the South African government sends it
own troops dressed in other armies' clothing when it wishes to
fabricate an offensive maneuver,'' Toivo said.
   Eddie Amkongo, a guerrilla spokesman in Windhoek, Namibia,
challenged Botha to prove his ``naive and childish remarks.''
   ``If it can be proved that Mr. Botha is spreading lies, days
before the people of Namibia are about to exercise their democratic
rights, SWAPO would have no choice but to assume that South Africa
has a hidden agenda.''
   But Francois Giuliani, the chief U.N. spokesman, told reporters
in New York: ``We are not aware of any such action along the
Namibian border ... This is the first we have heard of it.''
   Giuliani, responding to a question at a daily news briefing,
said Botha had telephoned the U.N. chief at 8:30 a.m. EDT ``to
inform the secretary-general of his allegations.''
Undersecretary-General Marrack Goulding, in charge of U.N.
peacekeeping operations, also was informed, he said.
   SWAPO maintained bases in Angola during its 23-year bush war
against South African rule, but is not supposed to have armed
personnel in Namibia during the transitional period. Under the U.N.
plan, South Africa also withdrew its troops from the territory.
   SWAPO is favored to get the most votes in a five-day election
starting next Tuesday for seats in an assembly that will draft a
constitution for Namibia.
   After a Cabinet meeting, Botha said he met with ambassadors of
the United States, Britain, Canada, West Germany and other Western
countries, urging them to do whatever they can ``to end this now.''
   ``The messages made it clear that SWAPO warned (United Nations)
patrols they they shouldn't interfere or they would be shot,''
Botha said. ``The tendency of (U.N. peacekeeping troops) is that
they are wishing to evacuate, to run.''
   He said the U.N. peacekeeping force is ``certainly not doing its
job, it is frightened to do it where SWAPO is involved.''
   ``Unless this is resolved within days, the South African
government is reserving the right to take whatever steps would be
required to ensure that all parties comply with their
obligations,'' Botha said. ``The South African security forces have
been put on alert.''
   Botha said military units in Walvis Bay, a South African enclave
on Namibia's coast, had been included in the alert.
   If South Africa was forced to act, Botha said, the election
definitely would be delayed.
   South Africa has ruled Namibia, a former German colony, since
1915. In December, South Africa signed accords with Angola and Cuba
agreeing to cooperate with a U.N. plan for Namibia's transition to
independence as Cuba withdraws its 50,000 troops from Angola.

   Thousands of coal miners walked off their jobs
briefly in the eastern Ukraine on Wednesday to press demands for
higher coal prices, an end to corruption and political reform, a
strike leader said.
   Yuri Bolderev, a member of the Donetsk strike committee, said in
an interview that miners from that city stayed off their jobs for
two hours despite a regional strike committee's decision Tuesday
not to strike.
   Twenty miners with tens of thousands of workers struck briefly
and one mine, the October, struck for 24 hours, he said.
   The miners are demanding a higher price from the government for
the coal they produce, an end to bribery and corruption in mine
adminstration, and political reforms. Bolderev said they want
direct elections of regional and national leaders and an end to the
Communist Party's special status as the leading force of Soviet
society, which is written into the country's constitution.
   Miners in the Donetsk Basin, the country's top coal-producing
area, are among those who struck in July to demand that the
government improve their social and economic conditions, as well as
make further political reforms.
   The government agreed to meet their demands, but miners have
complained it has been slow to fulfill its obligations.
   One mine in the Vorkuta region of the Soviet Arctic has been on
strike since Friday.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate finished work Wednesday on
legislation providing money to pay $20,000 to each surviving
Japanese-American interned during World War II, sending the measure
back to the House.
   The funds were contained in a $17.2 billion measure for the
Commerce, Justice and State departments for the fiscal year that
began Oct. 1.
   In two days of debate, the Senate made three changes that
necessitated the measure be returned to the House.
   Senators repealed economic sanctions against Argentina, adjusted
the State Department's budget and altered a formula used to
distribute anti-drug grants to state and local governments.
   There was no discussion of the reparation payments that would go
to each of the 60,000 surviving Japanese-Americans the U.S.
government interned during World War II.
   Under the legislation, the government would make $500 million of
the payments the fiscal year beginning next Oct. 1, $500 million
the next year and the remaining $200 million the year after that.
   In the only vote Wednesday, the Senate rejected 53-45 a proposal
by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., to impose an array of trade sanctions
on China for its repression of citizens since last spring's
pro-democracy demonstrations.
   The House approved the overall bill last Thursday.

<HEAD>Transportation Department Proposal Would Add Alcohol Testing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Transportation Department intends to draw
up rules that could include random testing for alcohol abuse among
workers in the transportation industry.
   Following the pattern of drug-testing rules, the department says
in a notice in Thursday's Federal Register that it is considering
several steps to combat alcohol abuse. The department asks for
public comments on alcohol problems in the transportation industry
to be submitted by Jan. 31.
   ``We ought to find ways of dealing with alcohol-impaired
operators in a safety environment,'' Transportation Secretary
Samuel Skinner said in an interview earlier this week. On Tuesday,
he discussed proposals for rules on alcohol-abuse testing with
trucking groups meeting in Chicago.
   Tests for alcohol abuse were not included in the Transportation
Department's drug-testing rules, which take effect in December.
Portions of the rules covering highway transportation workers _
opposed by many truckers _ have been stopped by a court injunction.
   Separately, Congress is working on legislation that would
require drug testing in the transportation industry. A Senate
measure would add alcohol testing.
   Among options being considered by the department are requiring
pre-employment, periodic, reasonable-cause, post-accident and
random alcohol testing of transportation employees in jobs where
public safety is at stake.
   Another proposal would set up programs to identify alcohol
abusers and persuade them to enter rehabilitation programs, ``with
the understanding that the identified abusers could retain their
jobs after successful rehabilitation.''
   A third proposal would establish assistance programs to educate
employees and employers on the dangers of alcohol abuse and how to
detect it on the job.
   The Federal Aviation, Highway and Railroad administrations
already have rules that prohibit drinking on the job and set a far
tougher standard for blood alcohol content among commercial
operators than the levels used by police departments to determine
intoxication.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Construction spending after surging ahead in
August was unchanged last month, the government said Wednesday in
another report reflecting continued weakness in that segment of the
economy.
   The Commerce Department said residential, non-residential and
government construction spending totaled a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of $415.6 billion in September after jumping 1.5
percent in August following declines of 1.8 percent in July and 0.8
percent in June.
   Spending had spurted in August because of a strong 5.3 percent
increase in government building and a 2.9 percent gain in
non-residential construction.
   But economist David Berson of the Federal National Mortgage
Association said that pace of spending is unsustainable because of
government budget problems and a glut of vacant office buildings.
   The construction industry has been among the sectors of the
economy hardest hit by the Federal Reserve's campaign to keep
inflation in check.
   But the Fed has been easing its grip on the economy and analysts
have been looking for a slight pickup in construction spending as
interest rates fall.
   Fixed-rate mortgages declined from a peak of 11.22 percent in
March to 10.16 percent at the end of September, according to the
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
   Private construction was off 1.2 percent last month to an annual
rate of $327.6 billion, reflecting declines in both residential and
non-residential building.
   Residential building, which accounts for nearly half of
construction spending, fell 0.9 percent to a $191.9 billion rate.
That included a drop of 1.1 percent in single-family construction
to $111.5 billion and a 2.2 percent decline in apartment building
to $22.7 billion.
   Non-residential construction, such as factories and office
buildings that represent about 20 percent of construction spending,
fell 2.6 percent to $99.1 billion at an annual rate.
   The volatile government projects category, representing another
20 percent of construction spending, was up 4.3 percent to $88
billion.
   The total construction spending figure for the first nine months
was up 1 percent from the same period of 1988.

<TEXT>
   A fair-housing group has sued The Cincinnati
Enquirer, charging that the newspaper's real estate advertising
violates the Fair Housing Act by featuring only whites in
illustrations.
   Karla Irvine, executive director of Housing Opportunities Made
Equal, or HOME, said Tuesday that among 1,000 ads appearing in The
Enquirer between Nov. 8, 1987, and Oct. 15, 1989, only nine
featured non-white models.
   ``If you only advertise with white models, you're saying your
market is only for whites,'' Ms. Irvine said.
   The lawsuit filed in federal court asks for an end to the
alleged practices and seeks unspecified damages.
   George Blake, editor of The Cincinnati Enquirer, said the suit
was misdirected.
   ``It is unfortunate that Housing Opportunities Made Equal Inc.
has chosen to sue The Enquirer and to engage in costly and
time-consuming legal proceedings rather than working directly and
constructively with the advertisers HOME complains about in its
lawsuit,'' Blake said.
   ``We do not agree with the basis of the lawsuit and will proceed
to exercise our rights in the federal court system. We have and
will continue to abide by the laws that cover the operation of the
newspaper.''
   Robert B. Newman, a lawyer who filed the lawsuit for HOME, said
asking the newspaper to make changes was more economical than
pursuing each advertiser in court.
   Ms. Irvine said only two builders advertising in the newspaper
use non-white models in their real estate ads.

   An express train traveling from New
Delhi to Calcutta derailed today, killing at least 52 people and
injuring 64, news reports said.
   Press Trust of India quoted Railway Minister Madhav Rao Scindia
as saying 36 bodies were removed from the wreckage and five more
were being extricated.
   At least 11 passengers died in hospital, the news agency said,
quoting sources in the railways.
   It also quoted passengers as saying that up to 100 people were
killed and 200 injured. United News of India news agency said more
bodies could be trapped under the train's smashed cars.
   Ten of the Toofan Express' 18 coaches derailed outside the
railroad station at Sakaldiha, about 435 miles southeast of New
Delhi, the spokesman said.
   The cause of the derailment was not known, he said, speaking on
condition of anonymity in keeping with government practice.
   He said he did not know how many people were aboard the Toofan
Express. Trains between New Delhi and Calcutta are usually crowded,
carrying several hundred people.
   Press Trust and United News of India said one of the derailed
cars plunged into a water-filled ditch. The agencies' initial
reports said eight cars had fallen into the ditch.
   Press Trust said injured passengers were taken to the railway
hospital at Mughalsarai, 11 miles west of the crash. Doctors from
other towns were rushed to the area.
   Mughalsarai is a major railroad junction near the border of
Uttar Pradesh and Bihar states.
   In April, 67 people were killed when several cars of a
high-speed train derailed and tumbled down a rocky embankment near
Lalitpur, 280 miles south of New Delhi.
   More than 100 people were killed in July 1988 when another
high-speed train plunged off a bridge and into a river in the
southern state of Kerala.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the New York Stock Exchange
said today he could support giving the federal government authority
to suspend program trading during times of wild swings in stock
prices.
   Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. testified before a House Commerce
subcommittee, which is considering legislation to permit the
Securities and Exchange Commission to suspend trading that is
controlled by computer program.
   ``We have to sit down with the commission to see how they feel
about such emergency powers,'' Phelan told reporters after
testifying in a closed session of the subcommittee.
   Phelan said he will take up the issue when he meets Thursday
with the board of governors of the New York exchange.
   Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the Commerce
subcommittee on telecommunications and finance, said disruptions
associated with broad swings in stock prices leave the impression
with many potential investors that the stock market has become
``the playground of a few privileged firms.''
   ``The bottom line is that we are messing with the golden goose _
capital formation,'' Markey said.
   Phelan said in an earlier interview with The Washington Post
that if broad price swings are left unchecked, ``it is going to
destroy the markets as a capital-raising mechanism, much less as a
place where people can invest intelligently.''
   ``A lot of people think it is a New York Stock Exchange issue,''
he said. ``It is a national issue _ liquidity in all markets and
volatility in all markets.''
   ``It affects individual investors because they get frightened to
death of this volatility that is there, and we don't blame them,''
Phelan said.
   Phelan's remarks came as he was preparing to testify today to
the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on telecommunications
and finance and meet Thursday with the exchange's board of
governors.
   The closed-door hearing on Capitol Hill was to examine the
causes of the Oct. 13 market plunge that saw the Dow Jones
industrial average plunged more than 190 points.
   Considerable criticism has been focused on the practice of
massive buying and selling triggered by computer programs that have
caused stock prices to move quickly and dramatically. Phelan
offered no specifics on what if anything should be done about the
program trading.

<TEXT>
   The shipboard summit next month between
President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will take
place in the waters off Malta, a group of five islands in the
central Mediterranean, the White Housesaid today.
   The location was disclosed as the White House said preliminary
meetings had begun to plan the issues that Bush would raise at the
Dec. 2-3 meeting and logistics for the trip.
   Original speculation about the summit site had centered on the
waters off Italy, since Gorbachev will conclude a visit there on
Dec. 1. However, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater
issued a mid-day announcement pinpointing the waters off Malta as
the site.
   Malta is an independent republic in the central Mediterranean
consisting of five islands, two of them uninhabited. It lies 58
miles south of Sicily, 220 miles north of Libya and 180 miles east
of Tunisia.
   Earlier today, a Soviet government spokesman joined the chorus
of American praise for the seawater summit next month, saying the
meeting could be ``the end of the Cold War.''
   Bush said Tuesday he and Gorbachev would meet on ships in the
Mediterranean Sea for `informal'' discussions of a wide range of
topics including the ``dynamic change'' in the communist world.
   Bush said the meeting would not focus on strategic arms
reduction talks but instead would allow the leaders ``to put up our
feet'' and ``deepen our respective understanding of each other's
views.''
   ``I don't want to have two gigantic ships pass in the night
because of failed communication,'' Bush said. ``I just didn't want
to _ in this time of dynamic change _ miss something, something
that I might get better firsthand from Mr. Gorbachev.''
   Gennady Gerasimov, Soviet foreign ministry spokesman, said
today, ``I think that this meeting can just be the end of the Cold
War. The Cold War will be dumped down to the bottom of the
Mediterranean Sea.''
   He was interviewed from Moscow on the ABC-TV show, ``Good
Morning America.''
   Also interviewed from Moscow was Zbigniew Brzezinski, who was
national security adviser to former President Carter. ``I sense
that we're reaching a point in which we can seriously tackle some
of the most basic issues for the Cold War,'' he said.
   The December meeting, to be held on U.S. and Soviet warships on
alternate days, would be the first presidential meeting between
Bush and Gorbachev. They met previously in New York on Dec. 7,
1988, when Bush was vice president and president-elect.
   Bush and Gorbachev still plan to meet next spring or summer to
discuss arms control in a more formal setting, said the president
and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, who made a
simultaneous announcement in Moscow.
   The decision to meet less formally before the end of 1989 ``is a
very positive thing,'' said House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash.,
adding that he hoped the meeting would ``stimulate greater speed in
moving on the arms control proposal.''
   ``I think a saltwater summit is a good idea,'' said Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen, D-Texas. ``An informal meeting at sea could provide the
right atmosphere to get things moving in several channels,
including trade as well as arms control.''
   The deputy GOP leader in the Senate, Alan Simpson of Wyoming,
said, ``It is a good time to have a meeting.''
   But the senior Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said it was ``more public
relations'' by Gorbachev.
   ``I hope that no fundamental decisions of any sort will be
made,'' said Helms, one of the few members of Congress to criticize
the announcement.
   One of Bush's most vocal critics, Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, applauded the meeting, but repeated his charge
that Bush was too ``timid'' in responding to Gorbachev's domestic
reforms, the democratic changes in Poland and Hungary, and the
demands for freedom in East Germany and Czechoslovakia.
   Bush, who earlier had rejected calls for an early meeting with
Gorbachev, told a news conference that ``what changed my mind on it
was consultation with our allies; the rapidity of change in Eastern
Europe; the emergence of democracies in this hemisphere; and this
concept of ... dynamic change is something that I might get better
firsthand from Mr. Gorbachev.''
   The president rejected suggestions that he proposed the informal
meeting to deflect domestic criticism and to help Gorbachev fend
off rivals.
   ``That's not why we are doing it, but if that should be the
fallout, so be it,'' said Bush. ``I've elected to remain very quiet
in the face of a good deal of sentiment that we were missing an
opportunity.''
   Officials said they did not know if first ladies Barbara Bush
and Raisa Gorbachev would accompany their husbands.
   The idea for the informal meeting began when Bush visited Poland
and Hungary in July and reformers there urged him to support
Gorbachev's efforts to change the Soviet bloc. On the plane home,
he wrote Gorbachev a letter proposing the meeting, aides said.
   Although Gorbachev responded ``immediately and
enthusiastically'' in August, said Bush, the planning was secret,
known only to top White House advisers, Secretary of State James A.
Baker III and a few of his senior aides.
   ``It was a bolt from the blue'' to working level officials, said
one administration source, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Bush and Gorbachev are expected to hold the talks only with a
handful of senior aides rather than the cumbersome working groups
typical of earlier summits, said administration sources.
   Bush and Shevardnadze said they were not calling the planned
meeting a summit, echoing comments by then-President Reagan on the
eve of his October 1986 meeting with Gorbachev in Iceland, where
the two leaders ended up competing to make the most sweeping
proposals to destroy superpower nuclear weapons. The meeting
foundered over Reagan's plan for Star Wars anti-missile defenses.
   The seawater summit will not be a repeat of Iceland, said Bush.
   ``It's not going to be an arms control meeting,'' said Bush.
``Neither President Gorbachev nor I anticipate that substantial
decisions or agreements will emerge from this December meeting.''

   Two more bodies were pulled from the rubble
of Interstate 880, and authorities said they did not expect to find
any more victims at the earthquake-flattened highway.
   The discoveries raised the death toll from the Oct. 17
earthquake to 66.
   The bodies of Joyce Ann Mabry, 31, of Berkeley, and James J.
Flores, 39, of Rohnert Park were recovered as searchers slowly

there in the rain, the cold, the night, and it's hard to describe,
but we're glad he's down,'' Flores' brother, Leonard, said Tuesday.
   ``Gradually, as time goes on we'll be able to continue life and,
like I said, put flowers on his grave and talk good things about
him and not think of him as he was in that smashed truck like
that.''
   Flores, whose body was found Tuesday, had a teen-age child. The
body of Mabry, who had a 3-year-old son, was discovered late Monday.
   Forty-one bodies have been recovered at the highway, the most of
any single location hit by the quake.
   ``We have no reason to believe there are any more bodies
there,'' said Alameda County sheriff's Sgt. Jim Knudsen. ``We're
checking the vehicles for personal belongings.''
   The 7.1-magnitude quake that spread ruin along a 90-mile swath
from Watsonville north to San Francisco and Oakland was the focus
of a hearing Tuesday by the state Seismic Safety Commission in San
Francisco.
   ``Seismic reinforcing has been painfully slow and has depended
upon available money and social priorties,'' said Chairman Lloyd S.
Cluff. ``It is clear that our earthquake hazards reduction program
needs to take giant steps to make significant progress before the
next damaging earthquake.''
   Cluff said California must urgently allocate time and money now
to save thousands of lives and billions of dollars in the future
earthquakes.
   The task of the 14-year-old commission is to make
recommendations to the governor and Legislature on what should be
done to reduce quake hazards.
   The Legislature meets Thursday in a special session to take up a
proposal for a quarter-cent sales tax to help pay the state's share
of the rebuilding costs. The tax would last 19 months and raise
$800 million.
   Greg Bayol, spokesman for the state Department of
Transportation, said today that the target date for reopening the
Bay Bridge _ the area's most vital transportation link _ is
sometime before Thanksgiving, Nov. 23.
   ``We're pushing to have it done before Thanksgiving and that's
possible,'' said Bayol. ``But to be kind of realistic. ... It could
take conceivably to the end of the month.''
   Throughout the earthquake-battered region, damage reports
continued to mount. The Federal Emergency Management Agency said
32,708 people had registered for disaster aid by Tuesday night.
   Agency officials also announced that 712 checks for emergency
housing grants totaling $1.9 million had been issued since the
start of check distribution Saturday.
   Gov. George Deukmejian declared a state of emergency for Solano
County and the city of Tracy, adding those areas to 10 other cities
and counties for which he had already issued declarations. The
proclamation implements state disaster assistance programs in those
areas.
   In other developments:
   _Damage to San Francisco International Airport was estimated at
$17 million. Airport manager Lou Turpin said it probably will cost
$8 million alone to replace a cargo building that had to be
demolished.
   _Crop losses and structural damage at Santa Cruz County farms
probably will reach $20 million, county Farm Bureau official Steve
Siri said. He said no low-interest loans were available to help
growers rebuild.
   _In the city of Santa Cruz, the first 30 of 130 Pacific Garden
Mall merchants were allowed into their businesses to survey damage
and remove important papers and small items, city spokeswoman
Anne-Marie Mitroff said. ``It all went smoother than we
anticipated. People were just happy to get in and see for the first
time,'' she said.
   _Businesses on the Monterey Peninsula began trying to get the
word out to tourists that the scenic coastline was undamaged.

   Two weeks after a human rights group filed
suit against the military government in connection with dozens of
prison deaths, more than 2,000 inmates have been freed, the Justice
Ministry said Wednesday.
   The ministry also said a committee would be set up to facilitate
the release of detainees and inmates.
   The statement provided no details on who would be released. In
the past, the government has freed those awaiting trial or
convicted of minor crimes. In some cases, prisoners have waited
years to go to trial.
   The Civil Liberties Organization, a Nigerian group that has
pressed for human rights in the West African nation, alleged last
month that 78 inmates died in one prison this year because of
malnutrition, lack of medical care and inhuman conditions.
   The organization demanded $1 million in compensation for the
relatives of the dead prisoners.
   Hundreds of deaths have been reported in Nigerian prisons
recently.
   Amnesty International reported this year that jail cells and
prisons had ``grossly deficient sanitation and overcrowding,'' and
a large number of prisoners died from disease and medical neglect.

<HEAD>High Court Case: Should Sympathy Be Factor in Death Penalty?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sympathy should not be a factor when a jury
decides whether a convicted murderer deserves the death penalty, a
lawyer for Oklahoma told the Supreme Court on Wednesday.
   ``We think that sympathy is among a catalogue of things that
could improperly influence the sentence,'' Oklahoma Assistant
Attorney General Robert Nance told the justices.
   Nance urged the court to reinstate the overturned death sentence
of Robyn Leroy Parks, convicted of the 1977 killing of Abdullah
Ibrahim, an Oklahoma City gas station attendant.
   The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, while upholding Parks'
conviction, threw out his death sentence last year.
   The judge at Parks' sentencing trial told jurors, among other
things, ``You must avoid any influence of sympathy, sentiment,
passion, prejudice or other arbitrary factor when imposing
sentence.''
   The appeals court said that instruction ``undermines the jury's
consideration of mitigating evidence'' _ factors suggesting life
imprisonment rather than death as the appropriate punishment.
   Nance argued Wednesday that the appeals court was mistaken.
``This instruction ... did not construct any additional barriers to
the consideration of mitigating evidence,'' he said.
   But Vivian Berger, a New York City lawyer appointed by the
justices to represent Parks, contended that jurors could be mislead
by the anti-sympathy instruction.
   ``We have to look at this through the eyes of lay jurors,'' she
said. ``This instruction interferes with the full consideration of
mitigating evidence.''
   At Parks' sentencing trial, jurors were told about eight
mitigating factors _ most of them based on Parks' troubled
childhood.
   But Ms. Berger said jurors could have mistakenly thought that
along with avoiding any sympathy they must also avoid considering
mitigating factors presented by Parks.
   Parks ``does not assert any constitutional right to a
sympathetic jury, only a right to a sentencer not precluded from
considering any mitigating factor,'' Ms. Berger said.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Antonin Scalia
voiced skepticism over the potential for juror confusion.
   Many of the court's questions, however, centered on whether a
decision favoring Parks could be applied retroactively to other
death row inmates across the country. Several justices said they
doubted such a ruling would have to be applied retroactively.
   That question was not among those presented by Oklahoma's
appeal, and its discussion during the oral argument session may _
or may not _ indicate at least five votes among the nine justices
to uphold Parks' victory in the appeals court.
   The justices in 1987 upheld a California murderer's death
sentence even though jurors in that case were told they should not
be swayed by ``mere sympathy.''
   The justices, by a 5-4 vote, said in the California case that a
reasonable juror would ``understand the instruction not to rely on
`mere sympathy' as a directive to ignore only the sort of sympathy
that would be totally divorced from the (mitigating) evidence.''
   The court is expected to announce its decision in Parks' case by
July.
   The case is Saffle vs. Parks, 88-1264.

   South Korea and Poland established
diplomatic relations Wednesday, and Seoul announced $450 million in
loans to the financially strapped government in Warsaw.
   Poland is the second East Bloc nation to establish ties with the
conservative Seoul government.
   The accord was signed in Seoul by South Korean Foreign Minister
Choi Ho-joong and Polish Undersecretary of State Jan Majewski.
   South Korea said it hoped the opening of relations with Warsaw
would lead to establishing ties with other socialist nations and
help ease tensions on the divided Korean peninsula.
   ``The opening of Korea-Polish diplomatic relations is expected
to have a favorable effect on efforts to establish similar
relations with other socialist countries,'' South Korea's Foreign
Ministry said.
   The agreement calls for South Korea to provide $450 million in
loans to Poland in the next five years. Also signed were trade and
investment guarantee agreements to promote mutual trade and
investment.
   President Roh Tae-woo wants to establish ties with communist
nations to reduce support for rival communist North Korea and
increase international acceptance of his own government.
   Roh hopes North Korea will pose less of a threat to regional
stability if its communist allies develop friendly relations with
Seoul and discourage any aggressive moves by the government in
Pyongyang.
   The breakthrough with Poland raised hopes among South Korean
officials that the Soviet Union may broaden ties with Seoul. The
Soviet Chamber of Commerce has established a trade office in Seoul,
but South Korea has pressed for more formal ties.
   The Korean peninsula was divided at the end of World War II.
Communist nations until recently shunned South Korea because of
their ties to North Korea.
   The daily Dong-A Ilbo newspaper said Poland originally requested
$1 billion in aid, but Korean officials said they could not afford
it. South Korea agreed to loan Hungary $120 million when it
established relations in February.
   South Korea expects to export textiles, machinery, electric and
electronic items to Poland. The 1988 bilaterial trade between the
two countries amounted to $42 million, nearly double the year
before.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto
defeated the first no-confidence motion in Pakistan's 42-year
history Wednesday. Her opponents in Parliament claimed the vote was
rigged.
   The combined opposition mustered 107 votes in the 237-seat
National Assembly, 12 short of a majority.
   ``I have no rancor nor any ill will against those who have moved
the no-trust motion against me,'' she said after Speaker Meraj
Khalid read the tally.
   Khalid called it ``a historical moment for the country.''
   Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi, leader of the opposition sominated by the
center-right Islamic Democratic Alliance, said, ``We will bow to
the decision of the house.''
   He said at a news conference, however, that 22 members of Ms.
Bhutto's left-leaning Pakistan People's Party were confined to her
office to keep them from voting against her.
   A spokesman for the prime minister called that ``absolute
nonsense.''
   Ms. Bhutto's left-leaning party has 111 seats in the assembly
and governs with the aid of smaller parties and independents.
   She said after the vote: ``This is a time for reflection by the
government. We are exploring the possibility of negotiating with
the more moderate elements of our opposition.''
   Her supporters rose to applaud as the 36-year-old prime minister
entered the chamber before the debate wearing the colors of the
Pakistani flag _ a loose native dress of green and a white scarf.
She expects her second child by the end of the year.
   Members were given military escorts to the Parliament building,
which was surrounded by soldiers and police. Opposition legislators
had requested the special security to ensure them access to the
session.
   Authorities banned processions in Islamabad and some other
cities to prevent clashes between supporterw and opponents of the
government.
   Police in Karachi, Pakistan's largest city, said young men set a
bus ablaze and fired shots into the air, but no one was injured.
They said it was not clear whether the disturbances were related to
events in the capital.
   In Lahore, a northeastern city where no ban was imposed,
supporters of Ms. Bhutto's party chanted slogans and set off
fireworks in celebration of her victory. No violence was reported.
   Opponents accuse Ms. Bhutto's government of corruption and say
she has not pursued economic reforms they deem necessary.
   She has denied the corruption charges, but said Wednesday:
``What mistakes we've made, we've made. We're not angels.''
   The opposition put the no-confidence motion forward after a
small party of Indian immigrants who had supported the government
changed sides Oct. 23.
   Pakistan's first free elections in 11 years were held in
November 1988, three months after the death in a plane crash of
President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq.
   Gen. Zia overthrew Ms. Bhutto's father, Prime Minister Zulfikar
Ali Bhutto, in 1977. Bhutto subsequently was convicted of plotting
to murder a political foe, who was not killed, and was hanged in
1979.

   Investigators may have found a flaw in
an engine fan made from the same batch of titanium as the DC-10
disk suspected of causing a jet crash that killed 112 people, a
metallurgist testified today.
   James Wildey II, chief metallurgist for the National
Transportation Safety Board, said, however, there was no evidence
the disk pulled from another plane could have caused an accident
similar to the July 19 crash, which 184 people survived.
   Wildey testified on the second day of a hearing on the crash of
the United Airlines jet at Sioux Gateway Airport. Investigators say
the rear engine disintegrated in fight, severing the jet's
hydraulic lines and making the plane nearly impossible to control.
   Wildey said a hairline crack in the rear engine fan disk of the
plane existed before the crash and was visible to the naked eye
after the accident. But he said it is too early to say whether the
crack could have been detected before the crash.
   Wildey made no conclusion on how long the crack had been on the
General Electric Co. engine.
   After the crash, GE pulled out of service six other engine disks
made from the same source of titanium. Wildey said preliminary
tests show a possible flaw in one of the disks but that he could
not conclude it might have led to similar engine failure.
   ``There was no evidence of any type of fatigue or crack,'' he
said, although he did not otherwise describe the possible flaw.
   NTSB investigators also said they had not concluded that the
crack was responsible for the crash. Joseph Nall, the NTSB member
in charge of the Sioux City hearing, said no final decision on the
cause will be issued for months.
   Wildey said in his report that two cracks were found in the
United jet's disk but that only one _ a hairline crack _ existed
before the engine exploded in flight.
   Wildey's report is based on testing of the fan disk, found in
two pieces in corn fields near Alta, about 80 miles east of the
airport, where the airplane cartwheeled and burst into flames as
pilots tried to make an emergency landing.
   Last week, a Federal Aviation Administration official said tests
on the disk indicated that the crack was caused by a flaw in the
metal that probably was present when the disk was built 18 years
ago.
   United spokesman Rob Doughty said Tuesday that it was too early
to pinpoint the cause of the engine explosion. He said experts have
only had 12 days to study the disk, and ``a full analysis takes two
months.''
   Phillip Battaglia, an engineering test pilot from McDonnell
Douglas, which made the DC-10, testified Tuesday that the company
had not anticipated an explosion severing all three hydraulic lines
and did not have instructions on how a pilot should deal with the
problem.
   He said that it was unlikely any instructions could help a pilot
safely land such a crippled plane.
   ``It's my opinion that this is not a trainable maneuver,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   Wimp-baiting has been a factor in American
politics since early in the republic's history, and the result has
been a ``compulsive masculinity'' among recent presidents, says a
professor who has studied the wimp factor in history.
   The wimp theme has persisted since Thomas Jefferson, who was
called ``womanish,'' through Martin Van Buren, who was accused of
wearing corsets and taking too many baths, and George Bush, who had
to battle what Newsweek magazine called ``The Wimp Factor'' in a
1988 cover story that asked if he could overcome it.
   Adlai Stevenson, the Democrats' candidate against war hero
Dwight Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956, was called ``Adelade'' and
Walter F. Mondale, who ran against Ronald Reagan in 1984, had to
confront bumper stickers that said ``Mondale Eats Quiche.'' Quiche
is considered wimp food, unsuitable for manly presidential palates.
Ask Bush, who made a campaign point of eating manly pork rinds,
their cholesterol count be damned.
   Bruce Curtis, who teaches American thought and language at
Michigan State University, says in an age that's less muscular than
the past, presidents have felt obliged to reveal themselves as
tough and their opponents as sissies.
   ``Now that the ideal masculine man is farther removed from
reality than ever, many nostalgic men,and not a few nostalgic
women, demand that our public leaders appear more masculine than
ever,'' he says in an article in the November issue of American
Heritage.
   The result, he says, is for politicians to assert their virility.
   Thus, he says, no president has been more ``earthily vulgar''
than Lyndon Johnson, who ridiculed opponents of his Vietnam
policies as ``nervous Nellies.''
   Richard Nixon reached for a pugilistic methaphor to describe his
``kitchen debate'' with Nikita Khrushchev, saying he felt he had
been ``up against a bare-knuckle slugger who had goughed, kneed and
kicked.''
   ``Even Jimmy Carter, among recent presidents seemingly the least
driven by machismo, revealed during the 1988 campaign his
susceptibility to its public demands by remarking that Bush seemed
rather `effeminate,''' notes Curtis.
   In his day, Carter, too, was accused of acting like a wimp. In a
famous mistake, the Boston Globe went to press in 1980 with an
editorial bearing a prankish headline that had not been intended to
see the light of day: ``More Mush from the Wimp.''
   To offset perceived wimpishness, candidates often talk tough.
   Bush bragged, the day after his 1984 vice presidential debate
with Geraldine Ferraro, that he had ``kicked a little ass.''
   Teddy Roosevelt, outraged that Woodrow Wilson initially shied
away from plunging America into World War I, said what Wilson had
done was ``to emasculate American manhood.'' Ronald Reagan,
threatening to veto a bill if Congress sent it to him, borrowed a
line from movie strongman Clint Eastwood: ``Make my day.''
   In the 19th century, reformers were ridiculed as ``namby-pamby,
goody-goody gentlemen'' who ``sip cold tea.'' Andrew Jackson, the
war hero and Indian fighter, described another politician as ``Miss
Nancy.'' Jefferson was called ``womanish'' because he ``took
counsel of his feelings and imagination.''
   Stevenson was ``Adelade'' to the New York Daily News, which also
said he ``used teacup words'' and had the support of ``Harvard
lace-liberals'' and ``lace-panty diplomats.''
   The need to prove himself tough sent Michael Dukakis, the
Democrats' presidential candidate last year, into a tank turret for
the filming of a campaign commercial which backfired; Dukakis
didn't look like he belonged there.
   Bush fought to overcome ``the wimp factor'' although there was
an occasional lapse. Once he was overheard saying he'd have ``just
another splash'' of coffee.
   Women in politics, like Ms. Ferraro, or Rep. Patricia Schroeder,
D-Colo., who shed tears when she withdrew as a candidate for the
Democratic presidential nomination in 1988, ``are condemned no
matter what they do,'' Curtis wrote.
   ``If gentle, they are womanish; if tough, they are not womanly.
By tradition a female cannot be a courageous, charismatic, wise,
effective leader as a woman.''
   ``The point,'' concludes Curtis, ``is not that the `manly'
characteristics of the myth _ courage, assertiveness in the face of
aggression, righteous defense of the weak _ are undesirable or
dangerous in themselves. The cinematic myth is dangerous because it
is labeled `for men only' and because it may be distorted and
debased by actors on the public scene.''

<HEAD>Defense Minister Acknowledges Rebel Capture of Town</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Cambodia's defense minister admitted
Khmer Rouge guerrillas captured Pailin, a western town, and said
the city of Battambang was under martial law, a Thai newspaper
reported Wednesday.
   It was the first Cambodian acknowledgment of the loss of Pailin,
near the Thai border. Taking the town was the most important Khmer
Rouge victory since a Vietnamese invasion in December 1978 ousted
Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge government.
   North Vietnam blames China and other supporters of Cambodian
guerrillas for an increase in fighting since Vietnamese occupation
troops withdrew late in September, Hanoi's official news agency
reported Wednesday.
   The three guerrilla factions fighting the government North
Vietnam installed in Phnom Penh have made significant military
gains since the withdrawal. The Khmer Rouge said it captured Pailin
on Oct. 22.
   Tea Banh, the defense minister, was quoted as saying in The
Nation that government forces retreated from Pailin after three
days of heavy shelling and an assault by thousands of Khmer Rouge
fighters.
   ``It is hard to concentrate large numbers of our troops in one
area, so when the resistance troops moved in, to avoid loss of life
we retreated,'' it quoted him as saying. The Nation said the
interview was conducted in Phnom Penh, but it did not say when.
   Khmer Rouge radio has reported a drive by its forces toward
Battambang, a provincial capital east of Pailin. The paper quoted
Tea Banh as saying Battambang was put under martial law Oct. 26.
   A dusk-to-dawn curfew lifted at the beginning of 1989 was
reimposed Monday in Phnom Penh.
   Western diplomats and other observers have expressed doubt the
Cambodia army, described as poorly trained and led, can survive
without Vietnamese support. Some analysts fear the Khmer Rouge,
largest of the guerrilla groups, will return to power by military
means.
   Hundreds of thousands of Cambodians were killed in the bloody
reign of the Khmer Rouge between April 1975, when the Indochina war
ended, and the Vietnamese invasion.
   The defense minister said the guerrillas were trying to seize as
much territory as possible to increase their negotiating power, The
Nation reported.
   Advances by the non-communist forces of Prince Norodom Sihanouk,
Cambodia's former ruler, also have been reported, but Phnom Penh
radio claimed Monday an offensive they began in late September had
been stopped.
   Hanoi's official Vietnam News Agency, quoting the Communist
Party newspaper Nhan Danh, said China was trying to return the
Khmer Rouge to power.
   China is the main arms suppliers to Cambodian guerrillas and
gives most of its support to the Khmer Rouge.
   Vietnam accused China, the United States, Singapore and other
countries of reneging on a commitment to halt arms supplies to the
guerrillas after the Vietnamese pullout.
   The United States denies supplying weapons, but non-communist
guerrillas have said they receive military aid from Washington.

<HEAD>Acclaimed Play About Homosexuals, AIDS Ignites Controversy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY NACHTIGAL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   University officials will not stop
production of a critically acclaimed play about homosexuals and
AIDS despite a group's claim that it glorifies homosexuality and
promotes anti-family values.
   Marshall Gordon, president of Southwest Missouri State
University, said the school will not yield to detractors of ``The
Normal Heart'' and will allow it to be shown at a campus theater
Nov. 15-20.
   ``The play, we feel, is irresponsible,'' said Paul Summers,
chairman of a citzens group he says numbers about 100 people.
``There's nothing educational, there's nothing artistic about it.
We take strong exception to the language, to the portrayal of
homosexuality and its political agenda.''
   Gordon said Tuesday that students clearly have a consitutional
right _ and given the growing number of cases of acquired immune
deficiency syndrome, even a duty _ to produce such a play.
   ``I've said all along that the university should promulgate the
truth about the AIDS issue,'' Gordon said. ``The university
community, the city, state and nation should be aware of the
problems that are posed by the threat of AIDS. To continue to sweep
the issue under the rug is not in the nation's long-term interest.''
   The controversy began last month when a student at the
university, which has an enrollment of 19,000, gave a copy of the
script to Republican state Rep. Jean Dixon.
   ``The play is, in my opinion, political propaganda to evangelize
and recruit young people to the homosexual lifestyle,'' she said.
   Mrs. Dixon asked Gordon, the Board of Regents and arts and
letters Dean Bethany Oberst to prohibit the drama department from
staging the play. Department officials refused after consulting
attorneys, who said canceling the production would violate the
students' constitutional rights of free speech.
   ``The Normal Heart,'' by Larry Kramer, is set in New York in the
early 1980s. The drama, which premiered off-Broadway in 1985,
attacks society's slow response to the AIDS epidemic.
   Kramer said he was amazed the play was controversial in
Springfield. The city, with about 150,000 residents, is the
international headquarters of the Assemblies of God church and home
to several religious-affiliated colleges.
   ``The play has had over 600 productions all over the world and
this is the first time this has happened,'' Kramer said from his
Manhattan apartment. ``I wonder what exists in Springfield that
doesn't exist anywhere else.''
   The opposing group, Citizens Demanding Standards, took out a
full-page advertisement Sunday in The News-Leader in Springfield
denouncing the play.
   ``Do you want your tax dollars to promote homosexual,
anti-family lifestyle?'' the ad asked.
   Gordon said feedback he is getting shows the majority of
townspeople, and by far most students and faculty, support the
play. Members of the Faculty Senate voted 37-1 Tuesday to support
the administration's decision to allow the play to go on.
   He said actress Kathleen Turner, a graduate of the university,
called him Monday to praise school officials for standing behind
the play. Ms. Turner contacted two other SMSU theater graduates,
actors John Goodman and Tess Harper, and the three plan to visit
Springfield during the play's run to show their support, Gordon
said.

   A medic who treated Italian soldiers in
World War I trenches and an Italian priest who founded a religious
order were declared saints of the Roman Catholic church Wednesday
by Pope John Paul II.
   The pope conducted the canonization ceremony on the steps of
Saint Peter's Basilica before an All Saints' Day crowd of 30,000
people.
   John Paul described the two men as ``sensitive to the suffering,
caring toward the abandoned, participants in the anguish and
afflications of their brothers.''
   Elevated to sainthood were Riccardo Pampuri, a medic who served
on the frontline in northern Italy in World War I and later became
a physician and member of a religious order, and Gaspare Bertoni,
who founded the Stigmatine Fathers in the 19th century.
   Pampuri died in 1930 at the age of 32 from tuberculosis
contracted in the war; Bertoni died in 1853.

<HEAD>Texas Amendment Would Delete Public Disavowal of Bribery</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Voters get to decide Tuesday whether taking
the oath of office in Texas is undignified.
   Proposition 7 would eliminate the century-old section of the
oath to which an officeholder must swear publicly that he or she
didn't bribe anyone to get the job.
   If the proposed state constitutional amendment passes,
officeholders still would swear to faithfully execute their duties
and preserve, protect and defend the constitutions and laws of the
United States and Texas.
   And they would be required to sign a written oath denying that
any bribery took place.
   But public disavowals of bribery would be out.
   Opponents said during the legislative debate that the oath, as
it stands, is no problem. They also said such amendments clutter
the ballot and detract from more important issues.
   Secretary of State George Bayoud said he didn't find taking the
oath undignified.
   ``I kind of like it,'' Bayoud said. ``During my swearing in,
there were people from around the state here and they said they
liked it.''
   The bribery provision was added to the 1876 Texas Constitution
as a reaction to corruption during Reconstruction.
   Backers of the change say it is an outdated remnant of another
time. And it's not as if the constitutional oath were sacrosanct.
It has been changed before.
   Until approval of a 1938 amendment, officeholders were required
to swear that they hadn't participated in a duel.

   A former Temple University professor has been
charged with killing his wife in their hot tub, but prosecutors say
they will have to bring him back from England to face charges.
   Delaware County District Attorney William Ryan Jr. announced
Tuesday that a complaint had been issued seeking the arrest in
England of Charles Bagley, who is accused of murdering his wife
March 26.
   Ryan said Bagley, a British citizen, left his home in Radnor
Township last June and returned to England with his two children
while an investigation was under way into the death of his wife,
Yvonne. Bagley resigned as a professor of finance at Temple after
his wife's death.
   Bagley claimed she was electrocuted accidentally in a whirlpool
bathtub in their home.
   The county medical examiner ruled Mrs. Bagley's death a homicide
from asphyxiation and multiple blunt injuries.
   Ryan said that after Bagley is arrested in England he will seek,
through the U.S. Justice Department and diplomatic channels,
Bagley's return to face trial.

   A high-level Soviet parliamentary group, the first
in four years, will visit Japan this month, a Foreign Ministry
spokesman said Wednesday.
   The delegation of the Supreme Soviet will be led by Communist
Party Politburo member Alexander N. Yakovlev, a close adviser to
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and considered to be the architect
of his policy of glasnost.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said the group's
program includes meetings with Japanese lawmakers to discuss
international problems and Soviet-Japanese relations.
   The group will visit Japan Nov. 12-19, Gerasimov said.
   The last similar visit to Japan by Soviet legislators was four
years ago.
   Improvement of relations between the two countries has been
hindered by their dispute over ownership of the Kuril Island chain,
located between the Soviet Kamchatka Peninsula and the northern
Japanese island Hokkaido.
   The Soviet Union captured the islands at the end of World War
II, and says they historically have been Russian territory. Japan
also claims a historic right to the islands.
   The dispute has prevented them from signing a treaty ending
World War II hostilities.

<DATELINE>DEADWOOD, S.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gunslingers dressed as Wild Bill Hickok
and Calamity Jane fired into the air at high noon on Main Street
today, signaling the start of legal gambling in the Old West town
where Hickok was killed in a card game.
   The start of limited poker, blackjack and slot-machine games
marked a return to Deadwood's past a century after gold miners
rushed to the Black Hills town hoping to strike it rich.
   As soon as the word was given, Evelyn Klocko of Central City
stuck six quarters in a slot machine, pulled the handle and won
$30. ``It doesn't take any brains to pull the handle,'' she said as
she counted her winnings.
   The Franklin Hotel lobby was jammed with people, many of whom
staked out chairs to grab when the gambling began. In the hour
before the games began, people crowded around the poker and
blackjack tables, some asking dealers how to play.
   Deadwood got 8 inches of snow overnight, so most of the opening
ceremony was moved indoors. The noon temperature was just above
freezing, but the sun shone and Main Street was crowded with the
curious and people itching to gamble.
   Thirty-four businesses are offering gambling at first, many of
them saloons. None call themselves casinos, however, because that's
forbidden by law.
   The state Gaming Commission on Tuesday approved 120 licenses for
gambling parlor employees, including dealers and cashiers. About 90
dealers had been licensed earlier, and officials were unsure how
many of the new licensees were dealers.
   Officials said about 200 dealers were needed. Even with the new
dealers approved Tuesday, Bill Fisher, floor manager in the Bella
Union Gaming Saloon, said: ``We are going to be short dealers, I'm
sure.''
   Gambling organizers say Deadwood gambling won't rival Las Vegas
or Atlantic City's high-stakes games, but maximum $5 poker bets
still could lead to winnings _ or losses _ of several hundred
dollars a game.
   Deadwood Dick's Bar, owned by Mary Dunne, didn't even have its
sign up Tuesday but promised to have slot machines and blackjack
ready for today.
   Frantic, last-minute construction continued.
   ``It isn't safe to go in a bar anymore because someone hands you
a hammer and asks if you want a job,'' she said over the din of
hammers and saws.
   In 1988, gambling supporters persuaded statewide voters to allow
the limited-stakes games for Deadwood.
   It's hard to predict how much money the games will bring into
government coffers, said Don Gromer, the Gaming Commission's
executive secretary. He thinks Deadwood will get $400,000 the first
year, the state will get $500,000, and Lawrence County will receive
$100,000.
   The city's cut of gambling proceeds is to be used for historic
preservation.
   Deadwood's colorful past includes gambling, prostitution and
shootouts. Wild Bill was shot in the back while holding aces and
eights in Deadwood's Saloon No. 10 in 1876.
   Police Chief Les Bradley hopes those days won't return. He just
added an officer to the force, bringing the total to six for the
community of 2,000.
   ``I'm not looking for any major crime,'' Bradley said. ``But
it's possible I might eat my words.''
   Opposition to gambling in Deadwood has been slight, and efforts
have started in at least two other South Dakota towns to offer
limited gambling.
   The Gaming Commission on Tuesday approved 24-hour gambling for
four businesses that are combination bars and restaurants.
   Gromer said bars must close at 2 a.m., so gambling must stop in
the bars then. But it can continue in restaurants. No liquor can be
served during the hours that bars are closed.
   Licensed establishments that don't sell liquor can have gambling
24 hours a day.
   Despair engendered by a decline in tourism in recent years has
given way to excitement and investment, said Bill Walsh, owner of
the 85-year-old Franklin Hotel.
   ``Deadwood's going to be fun again. That I believe with all my
heart,'' Walsh said. ``We're returning to the good old times of
Deadwood, and if we do that, we're going to be successful.''

<HEAD>Eleven Vie for Mickey Leland's Congressional Seat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSAN FAHLGREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Polls and political observers say it's not a
question of whether a Democrat will replace the late Mickey Leland
as representative for Houston's 18th Congressional District, it's
which Democrat among 11 candidates.
   ``This is considered to be one of the most Democratic areas of
the state, if not the nation,'' said Sherry Johnson, chairman of
the Harris County Republican Party. ``It was drawn that way as a
guaranteed seat. In the last election, something like 70 percent
voted for Michael Dukakis.''
   A special election to fill Leland's unexpired term is Nov. 7.
   Leland was killed in a plane crash in August while checking on
famine aid in Ethiopia, part of his longtime effort to focus
attention on world hunger.
   The district, a conglomeration of downtown oil company
headquarters and slums in central and northeast Houston, was
created in 1971 for Leland's predecessor, then-state Sen. Barbara
Jordan, who became one of the most prominent black women in
American politics.
   In 1980, 41 percent of the district's residents were black and
31 percent Hispanic.
   ``I don't believe there is any question that it is a Democrat's
seat,'' said Jack Carter, chairman of the Harris County Democratic
Party. ``The question is, which Democrat?''
   Seven of the 11 candidates are Democrats. Three are Republican
and one is Libertarian. The four front-runners are Democrats,
elected officials and, like Leland, black. They are State Sen.
Craig Washington, City Councilman Anthony Hall and state Reps. Ron
Wilson and Al Edwards.
   Since a candidate must have 50 percent to win the seat outright,
political observers are predicting Washington and Hall will be
forced into a runoff.
   The Houston Chronicle reported poll results Monday showing Hall
with the support of 32 percent and Washington 24 percent of
registered voters surveyed Oct. 21-25. Wilson and Edwards trailed
with 7 percent and 6 percent.
   Undecided voters totaled 30 percent, and the other seven
candidates shared 1 percent. The newspaper said its margin of
sampling error was plus or minus 6 percentage points.
   Washington, 47, a defense lawyer, served 10 years in the Texas
House and six in the Senate. He has a reputation as a champion of
liberal causes, including abortion rights, gay rights and better
AIDS care and concerns of the poor.
   ``I think this job requires one to have the courage to stand up
and make hard decisions,'' Washington said. ``I am afraid of
politicians who have no ideas of their own, but merely regurgitate
what other politicians say. You may not always agree with me, but
you always know where I stand.''
   Hall, 45, also a lawyer, has served on the City Council the past
10 years and as a state representative from 1973-78. He credits
himself with drafting a minority and women business enterprise
ordinance for the city and negotiating the city's anti-apartheid
law. He also has helped establish anti-drug ``Just Say No'' youth
clubs.
   ``Some say it is not enough to organize `Just Say No' clubs. I
have organized 50. It's not enough, but it is something,'' Hall
said.
   Wilson, 36, has been a state representative since 1977. He was a
teen-age aide to Leland in 1973. He is a law clerk and credits
himself with strengthening the House's Liquor Regulation Committee,
which he chairs. He repeatedly has sponsored bills to create a
state lottery and allow Texans to carry concealed handguns. If
elected, he wants more federal aid for education, job training and
drug control.
   Edwards, 52, a real estate and advertising salesman, has been a
legislator for 10 years. Edwards, who likes to mention his
connections to Jesse Jackson and the civil rights marches, has
focused his campaign on charges that his lawyer opponents have
conflicts of interest because ``lawyers are paid money by drug
dealers, murderers and rapists.''
   Other Democrats in the running include lawyer Shirley Fobbs and
businessmen Timothy John Hattenbach and Lee Arthur Demas Jr.
   Republicans vying for the term are lawyer Beverly Spenser,
businessman Manse R. Sharpe Jr. and educator Byron J. Johnson. Gary
Johnson, no relation, is the Libertarian candidate and is a stock
market investor who lives in Austin.

<HEAD>Parliament Members Tear-Gassed in Refugee Camp</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Eight members of the Swedish Parliament were
engulfed by tear gas fired by Israeli troops during a visit to a
Palestinian refugee camp Wednesday, but no one was seriously hurt,
a member of the delegation said.
   Per Gahrton, a legislator from the Green Party in Sweden, said
the incident occurred in the Balata Refugee Camp near Nablus.
   The incident has been reported to the Swedish consul in
Jerusalem, he said.
   Official army sources said they had no information about the
lawmakers' visit to Balata, but they said soldiers fired tear gas
in the Balata camp after an army lookout post on the edge of the
camp was hit by stones thrown by Palestinians. The sources insisted
on anonymity.
   Gahrton said the parliamentarians and about 12 members of the
Swedish-Palestinian Friendship Society took the tour, arranged with
the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, which oversees aid programs for
Palestinian refugees.
   He said the group was near a school and that about 100 girls
gathered around them, cheering and shouting welcomes.
   ``Then the tear gas began,'' Gahrton said. He said he believed
it was fired from an army checkpoint on a hill above the camp.
   One gas canister fell close to legislators, John Ahlquist, who
vomited from inhaling the fumes, he said.
   One window of the U.N. bus that brought the Parliament members
to the camp was broken while it was standing idle, and a rubber
bullet was found inside, he said. Israeli soldiers fire rubber
bullets for riot control.
   The Parliament group, which arrived Monday, is touring the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. The territories have
been torn by a 22-month Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule.

   Meet Wes Draper, charter member of the
Brick of the Month Club. Not that he ever meant to join, but for
the past few years, they've arrived: the Valentine Brick, the Get
Well Soon Brick, the Duck Brick.
   Santa Claus has delivered them. So has the U.S Postal Service.
They've been tucked behind Draper's screen door.
   He has enough bricks to build a small well, but until Wednesday,
he could have wished all he wanted and still not known where all
the bricks were coming from.
   He had his suspicions.
   The Drapers run with Belvidere's version of the merry
pranksters. They once piled 17 people into a car, called it a
hayride and motored around this working-class town of 15,000.
   Friends have found ``For Sale'' signs posted mysteriously in
their front yards. A relative's birthday was once marked with
``Burma Shave''-type signs along the city's streets.
   On Wednesday, Draper's friend Jerry Whitehead finally confessed
he and his wife, Joan, were behind the unsolicited subscription to
Brick of the Month Club.
   ``We always thought it might be him,'' Draper said in a
telephone interview.
   Whitehead says the whole thing is Draper's fault anyway _ and
Draper allows as how that might be so.
   ``It all started when I took a vacation to Tennessee a few years
ago. They had these bricks on sale for $2 or $3,'' Draper said.
   One of the bricks was from Loew's Grand Theater in Atlanta,
where ``Gone With the Wind'' _ one of Draper's favorites _
premiered.
   Draper bought it.
   ``Back in them days, we had a cocktail party once in a while and
I used to show it off,'' he said.
   ``It was just so stupid,'' Whitehead recalls. ``We had to do
something.''
   They did.
   A big red brick arrived at the Draper home a short time later.
   ``Dear Mr. Draper,'' said the unsigned letter accompanying it,
``It is ... a great pleasure to allow you to become an honorary
member of the Brick of the Month Club.''
   ``Since then, boy, I got a lot of bricks,'' Draper said.
   Santa Claus delivered a Christmas brick, with a Currier and
Ives-type print on one side.
   ``We asked Santa where it came from,'' said Draper's wife,
Marion. ``Santa Claus just ho-ho-ho-ed and wouldn't talk about it.''
   A ``Happy Valentines'' brick came in parts with an elaborate
blueprint for reassembly, a process requiring the placement of
arrows into holes at either end.
   He received a tiny ``bonus brick'' to hook on his key chain.
   People stopped Draper on the street to ask him about his bricks.
The town mayor gave him one. In all, there were more than two dozen
in his collection.
   He gave a speech to the local Kiwanis Club on the subject:
``Please keep in mind that brick collecting is becoming very
popular ...''
   The Whiteheads said they finally decided enough was enough and
on Wednesday revealed their secret to Draper in a newspaper article.
   ``I don't dare tell you'' how the score will be evened, Draper
said.
   ``I'll sure enough have to take him out to supper, won't I?''

   The State Department rejected on Wednesday
accusations by Burma's official media that U.S. Ambassador Burton
Levin has interfered in Burma's internal affairs with comments
criticizing the country's human rights performance.
   Deputy spokesman Richard Boucher called the charge baseless and
said Levin's ``activities and statements, and those of his embassy
colleagues, are governed by instructions from Washington.''
   Boucher had no details on the articles critical of Levin. He
said Levin has no plans to return to Washington as the result of
the dispute.
   ``We continue to be deeply concerned by the house arrest of the
co-leaders of Burma's principal opposition party, the National
League for Democracy, as well as the mass arrests this summer of
large numbers of political opponents of the military government,''
he said.
   Boucher said the United States hopes the Burmese government will
release all political prisoners and will allow them to take part in
the national elections planned for next May.
   ``In our view, elections which exclude participation of those
who represent Burmese aspirations for democratic change _ that is,
the aspirations which the Burmese people clearly desire _ cannot be
regarded as free and fair,'' he said.

   Turning 100 calls for more than the usual
birthday cake. It calls for fanfare.
   That's just what Edward J. Story's going to get for his birthday
_ and for being Notre Dame's oldest living graduate.
   Story's 100th birthday was Tuesday. He'll be honored Saturday in
South Bend, Ind., during halftime at the Notre Dame football game
with Navy.
   Story graduated from Notre Dame in 1911. He attended chemistry
classes with legendary Notre Dame football coach Knute Rockne.
   ``I helped him with his experiments,'' Story said.
   After graduation, Story worked as a pharmacist, served as an
Army lieutenant during World War I and taught high school.
   Story will get a T-shirt, a certificate and another belated
birthday present at the football game, said Charles F. Lennon Jr.,
director of Notre Dame's alumni association.
   ``He'll be wearing a hat that says Notre Dame Alumni Association
75-Year Club. He's the only member,'' Lennon said.
   Story credits his longevity to abstention from smoking, chewing,
drinking, gambling and running around.
   ``You wouldn't think I had much fun, and I sure don't,'' he said.

   Turkeys can do wonders for parking lot
scofflaws in the eyes of Judge Tom Fiorina.
   The judge is known for reducing parking fines in favor of
community service. And he did just that Tuesday night, when he
called a rare Halloween court session for chronic violators who had
failed to answer summonses.
   The municipal judge sought the presence of about 200 people, but
only about 40 showed up.
   Fiorina reduced fines, some as much as 80 percent, on the
condition the offenders who attended the court session donate food
to the poor, provide public service or sell tickets to Thanksgiving
In Santa Fe, an annual fund-raiser for charity.
   Adam Bernstein, who had about $500 worth of parking tickets,
left owing $12 and two turkeys for the poor.
   ``I'm known as a guy that's fair, maybe even more than fair,''
Fiorina said.
   Those who failed to show up won't be so lucky, he said.
   ``I thought Halloween would be a great night because it's trick
or treat, and those that didn't show up are going to find
themselves with two tricks, a ticket and a warrant,'' he said.

   One in six American women gets inadequate
prenatal care, according to a study released Wednesday.
   Pregnant women in the South are the most likely to receive
inadequate care, while those in the North Central region of the
country get the highest level of care, the study by the Alan
Guttmacher Institute found.
   The study estimated that 585,000 women nationally begin care in
the fifth month of pregnancy or later, or begin receiving prenatal
care early but make fewer than half of the 13 doctor visits
recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists.
   A disproportionate number of women receiving this level of care,
which the institute considers inadequate, are teen-agers, unmarried
women, blacks and Hispanics, according to the report.
   More than 660,000 women, or 18 percent of women who give birth,
begin receiving prenatal care early but make only half to 80
percent of the recommended visits, the survey found.
   ``This study demonstrates how very far we have to go, as a
nation, if we are to guarantee that all women get even relatively
adequate prenatal care,'' said Jeannie Rosoff, president of the New
York-based non-profit research and education group.
   The Department of Health and Human Services in 1980 set as one
of the nation's health goals to be achieved by the end of the
decade that at least 90 percent of women would start prenatal care
within the first three months of pregnancy.
   The study concluded that prenatal services must become more
available and more accessible to decrease the number of babies born
prematurely and underweight, chief causes of infant mortality.
   The U.S. rate of infant mortality is 10.4 per 1,000, ranking the
country 19th among industrialized nations.
   The institute said more public funding would be needed to
provide more needed services, but it didn't estimate how much.
   The report estimated that 15.7 percent of pregnant women in the
United States receive what the institute considers inadequate
prenatal care. The report found 18.8 percent of women in that
category in the South, 16.5 percent in the West, 14.4 in the
Northeast and 12.3 percent in the North Central states.
   The report was based on data from the National Center for Health
Statistics and the American Hospital Association, as well as a
survey of all state health departments and some local health
departments.

   Pan American World Airways is trying to prove
that Israel and West Germany warned U.S. authorities about an
impending terrorist attack on Flight 103 which was blown up last
December, according to papers filed in federal court.
   Pan Am has filed subpoenas demanding documents on any advance
warning given to the CIA, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the
FBI, the National Security Council, the National Security Agency
and the State Department.
   The airline also is demanding to question, beginning in
mid-November, anyone at the six agencies with knowledge of any
prior notice given to the U.S. government indicating that Flight
103 was targeted for attack, according to the documents.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh refused today to comment on the
subpoenas, except to say the Justice Department would give them
``due consideration'' and respond in court.
   The court papers said Pan Am and its security firm, Alert
Management Systems Inc., were taking action to prove West German
police warned U.S. officials of suspicious activities in the
baggage area at Frankfurt 90 minutes before the flight left there
Dec. 21.
   The airline said it is seeking a possible videotape of the
baggage containing the bomb being loaded in Frankfurt onto the
Boeing 727 that flew to London on the first leg of the New
York-bound flight.
   The airline, in papers filed in court in Brooklyn, N.Y., and
Washington, D.C., also said it wanted ``all documents concerning
warnings, tips, alerts, and other communications'' about possible
plans or threats of a terrorist attack on Flight 103.
   The London newspaper The Independent, which first reported the
court filings, quoted lawyers for families of Flight 103 victims as
saying Pan Am was on a ``fishing exercise'' to try to shift blame
for the disaster. The airline has been sued for more than $300
million.
   Lee Kreindler, an attorney representing the victims' families,
called the Pan Am subpoenas ``a lot of nonsense'' and a
``diversionary tactic.''
   It's ``probably an exercise by the public relations department
of Pan Am'' that ``won't have any effect'' on his case and ``won't
get anywhere,'' said Kreindler.
   The Boeing 747 that passengers boarded in London exploded over
Lockerbie, Scotland, killing all 259 people aboard and 11 on the
ground.
   The documents filed by Pan Am call on the six U.S. agencies ``to
disclose any documents relevant to surveillance by the BKA (West
Germany's FBI) of the Pan Am baggage-handling area at Frankfurt,
including video recordings made on the evening of 21 December
1988.''
   The papers demand all documents relating to what they say were
warnings from the Israeli secret service Mossad ``within the 24-36
hours before December 21, 1988, that Pan Am Flight 103 ... was the
target of a terrorist attack.'''
   The British government has said it received telephone warnings
of a bomb on a U.S. carrier in the weeks prior to Dec. 21, and U.S.
diplomats in Europe had been told to avoid Pan Am during the
Christmas season.
   Paul Hudson, an Albany lawyer who lost his 16-year-old daughter
on the plane, said his reaction to Pan Am's demand was ``oe of
shock ... one of dismay, followed by a furious reaction by most of
the relatives.''
   Hudson, chairman of a group called Families of Pan Am Flight
103, also predicted a ``tremendous outcry for accountability'' if
authorities ``knew that this flight or one very close to it was to
be bombed.''
   A CIA spokesman would not comment today on the allegations that
the Mossad warned the agency of the bombing 24 hours before it
happened. CIA spokesman Mark Mansfield said by telephone from
McLean, Va., that the CIA was among U.S. agencies subpoenaed by Pan
Am lawyers. He said he had no further comment on the case because
it is in litigation.
   The Independent's report said at least five people on the doomed
plane were U.S. government employees, either members of the CIA or
attached to it. It said the five included Matthew K. Gannon, a
political officer at the U.S. Embassy in Beirut who, it said, was
the CIA's deputy station chief in Lebanon.
   The paper said intelligence sources believe the team was on a
mission in Beirut connected to the American hostages there.

   Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. of the New York
Stock Exchange said Wednesday he could support allowing the federal
government to halt program trading when share prices drop too
rapidly.
   Phelan, who testified at a closed session of a House Commerce
subcommittee, said in earlier interviews that if left unchecked,
price volatility could destroy the stock market.
   The telecommunications and finance subcommittee, headed by Rep.
Edward Markey, D-Mass., is ready to draft legislation that would
give the Securities and Exchange Commission authority to halt
computer-programmed trading when prices move wildly.
   ``We have to sit down with the commission to see how they feel
about such emergency powers,'' Phelan told reporters after the
subcommittee session. The New York exchange could support such a
grant of power if the commission feels capable of administering it,
he said.
   Phelan pledged to work with Congress to find a solution. He will
meet Thursday with governors of the exchange amid speculation the
Big Board may take new action of its own to battle the volatility
problem.
   Phelan indicated he would like to see the Chicago markets join
with the New York exchange in any action aimed at curbing broad
swings in share prices.
   In earlier newspaper interviews, Phelan acknowledged wide
discontent among investors and brokers about how program trading of
huge blocs of stock can induce wild price swings that make many
people hesitant about buying shares.
   ``A lot of people think it is a New York Stock Exchange issue,''
he said. ``It is a national issue _ liquidity in all markets and
volatility in all markets. If it keeps up long enough, it is going
to destroy the markets as a capital-raising mechanism, much less as
a place where people can invest intelligently,'' he told The
Washington Post.
   His fears were echoed by Markey and other members of the
subcommittee.
   ``The bottom line is that we are messing with the golden goose _
capital formation,'' Markey said. ``The stock market matters. It's
not disconnected from ordinary people's lives ... It assures jobs
are there for blue-collar Americans.''
   Wednesday's hearing was scheduled after the Dow Jones Industrial
Average dropped 190 points during a wild day of computer-generated
trading on Oct. 13.
   ``Congress is ready to move'' with legislation aimed at
correcting the violatility problem, Markey said. ``There is a real
sense in our committee that something has to be done.''
   The New York exchange moved on its own last year to respond to
big swings in price. The exchange halted program trading through
its own computers any time the industrial averages moved 50 points
in one day. Traders quickly found a way around the prohibition.

   Former President Carter says he wouldn't
accept a million-dollar speaking fee like his successor, Ronald
Reagan, reportedly received during his recent trip to Japan.
   But, ``I've never been offered that much,'' Carter joked Tuesday
night before speaking to San Diego County business leaders about
Habitat for Humanity, a non-profit group that helps low-income
families build their own homes.
   Carter refused to criticize Reagan directly for reportedly
accepting $2 million in speaking fees during his trip to Japan,
including $1 million for a single speech to the Fujisankei
Communications Group last week in Tokyo.
   ``I've never criticized what presidents Nixon, Ford or Reagan do
with their post-White House years,'' he said when asked about
Reagan's fees. ``But that's not what I want out of life. We give
money, we don't take it.''
   Carter did criticize the scandal-plagued government housing
programs of the Reagan administration.
   ``It was absolutely disgusting to see a whole bunch of rich
friends of the president stealing millions of dollars from a
program that had already been robbed of 85 percent of its
resources,'' Carter said.

   The Rolling Stones, in town
for concerts Wednesday and Thursday, played cat-and-mouse with
photographers and fans.
   Mick Jagger, out for a Tuesday afternoon jog, jumped into a
trailing limousine when he spotted a TV crew.
   Jagger, wearing a gray sweatsuit and dark glasses, had popped
out of an elevator earlier at the Four Seasons Hotel, where the
rock 'n' roll band and its entourage have 10 suites on three
floors. He sprinted through the lower lobby with his entourage and
jumped into a waiting taxi. The official limo already had driven
off, apparently as a decoy.
   Hotel security guards and Stones' handlers used walkie-talkies
working on their strategy to avoid the curious and the media.

   New York Yankees outfielder Luis Polonia,
jailed for having sex with a 15-year-old girl, was temporarily
released by a judge Wednesday because the Dominican Republic
native's work visa had expired.
   Polonia, who had served 27 days of his 60-day sentence, also has
a contract to play winter baseball in his own courntry.
   He was ordered to return Feb. 1 to Milwaukee to serve the
balance of his sentence, said Circuit Judge Thomas Doherty.
   Doherty said that, if Polonia is not granted another employment
visa to return to the United States, he must do 90 hours of
community service in the Dominican Republic.
   Polinia, 24, pleaded no contest in August to a charge of having
sexual intercourse with a child. Besides the jail sentence, he was
fined $1,500 and ordered to contribute $10,000 to the Sinai
Samaritan Medical Center's sexual assault treatment center.

   Pulitzer Prize-winning author Alice Walker
says the violence in some of her writing is an outgrowth of her
childhood as the daughter of Georgia sharecroppers.
   ``It was a bad system where people could not get out of debt,''
Ms. Walker told about 600 people Tuesday at Temple University. ``We
lived in shacks. I was 17 before I lived in a house that didn't
leak.
   ``I was trying for myself to understand how this system of human
exploitation so killed the spirit of people ... that they were
unable to love their own. And why is it that they turned on their
own?''
   Ms. Walker also read from her latest novel, ``The Temple of My
Familiar,'' whose characters' stories span several lives over
thousands of years.
   She said the far-reaching settings from Latin America to
California, to Baltimore and Africa, show the similarity in
oppression of people throughout the world and how their struggles,
and origins, are connected.

   Capt. Al Haynes, the United Airlines pilot who
guided his disabled DC-10 to a crash landing at Sioux City, Iowa,
is back in the cockpit after a 3{-month leave.
   Haynes' wife, Darlene, and their daughter Laurie, were at
Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on Tuesday to see Haynes fly a
United DC-10 to San Francisco on the first leg of a three-day trip
across the country.
   ``It's time to get back,'' Haynes, 57, said.
   Haynes's heroic efforts during the July 19 crash of United
flight 232 helped save the lives of 184 of the 296 people aboard
the flight.
   A failed fan blade in an engine damaged the plane's hydraulic
system and robbed the cockpit crew of most of their control over
the plane.
   Haynes, with the help of an off-duty pilot aboard the flight,
used the two remaining engines to bring the plane down at the Souix
City airport.
   Tuesday's flight experienced no problems.
   One passenger, told Haynes was the pilot, said he was reassured.
   ``I'm glad to have him,'' said Dean Coonrod of Seattle. ``I know
he was a hell of a pilot.''

   Market Street divides a corner of San
Francisco into different worlds. One is the prosperous financial
district, largely untouched by the earthquake; the other is South
of Market.
   An intriguing mix of old and new, shabby and chic, South of
Market is little known by outsiders. And in the days since the Oct.
17 disaster, it's been all but forgotten even here, although it was
one of the areas hardest hit.
   South of Market, where warehouses, residential hotels and
wholesalers in recent years have been joined by fashionable
restaurants, offices and artists' studios, was the second-deadliest
place in the quake.
   Five people died under a torrent of bricks when the 15-second
upheaval wrenched off the top of a four-story building and sent it
tumbling onto a narrow street. Only the Nimitz freeway collapse in
Oakland, with 41 known deaths, claimed more lives.
   As for damage, ``South of Market is the second-most affected
area of San Francisco,'' said Michelle Pla, spokeswoman for the
city's Bureau of Building Inspection. Pla said dozens of buildings
were ``red-tagged,'' or judged unsafe.
   The most affected city district was the Marina, an affluent
neighborhood where entire apartment buildings crumpled and burned.
   ``Everyone feels sorry for the people in the Marina,'' said Eric
Pryor, whose South of Market residential hotel was red-tagged.
``But the people here are also victims of what I call the social
disaster in the city _ the real victims.''
   For some of the most unfortunate of the neighborhood's
displaced, the quake also took their jobs. Goodwill Industries was
forced to lay off about 150 people after suffering $2 million in
property damage and $3 million in equipment damage at its
83-year-old headquarters.
   ``We've laid off the disabled, the disadvantaged _ the working
poor, South of Market people that we serve with our rehabilitation,
job training and placement,'' said Goodwill spokeswoman Charleen
Harty.
   ``A lot of them live in the area. ... They now stand to lose
jobs and homes in one shot. Some of them aren't English speaking or
have hearing or vision loss. They cannot go through the normal
channels to get help,'' she said.
   City and relief officials had no count of South of Market
residents made at least temporarily homeless. For many, a traumatic
time has been made worse by being moved to different shelters.
   ``There's a certain amount of confusion to being in one place
for only a couple of days, then have to go the next place and the
next. It makes things even more difficult,'' said Michael Robb, a
registered nurse working in the mental health center of a Red Cross
shelter.
   The shelter, one of several in the city, started out at the
convention center, then for single men moved to a Navy helicopter
carrier, then to a large building a few blocks from City Hall.
Women and families were moved to the Presidio, an Army base.
   While its residents differ from those of the Marina, South of
Market is like that neighborhood in that areas most devastated are
built on fill _ rubble, mud and sand extending the original
shoreline into San Francisco Bay.
   South of Market was hard hit also because many of its buildings
are decades old, often unreinforced. One historic warehouse facing
possible demolition dates to 1867.
   In some places, narrow buildings lean slightly and the top lines
of broader structures appear to wave, following the buckling of the
street and soft earth below. Others show little or no damage from
the outside but are blocked off by yellow plastic tape and a
warning on the front door.
   ``A lot of these buildings look OK, but go inside and step on
some of the floors, and I'd be surprised if you don't fall
through,'' Pryor said.
   South of Market's wholesale sellers of every product from
flowers to expensive furniture, its discount clothing outlets and
its restaurants and bars were mostly spared serious damage.
   Still, there is a decline in traffic, affecting ``mostly the
service industries that depend on walk-in business _ retail,
restaurant, car repairs,'' said Patrice McCarthy, spokeswoman for
the South of Market Business Association.

<HEAD>Food Aid Seen as Possible Discouragement to Polish Farmers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Food aid from the West could discourage
production by Poland's own farmers, the chairman of the House
Agriculture Committee told the Bush administration on Wednesday.
   ``We don't want to get into that type of situation. It could
very well happen in Poland,'' Rep. Kika de la Garza said at a joint
hearing on food aid by the Agriculture and Foreign Affairs
committees.
   ``I know it has happened in several countries. ...,'' said de la
Garza, D-Texas. ``Polish farmers are among the best in the world
... Poland is one crop away from self-sufficiency,'' he said.
   His remarks followed close questioning of Bush administration
representatives by Rep. Gary L. Ackerman, D-N.Y., who said that
food aid given for political motives had discouraged farming in
Egypt and El Salvador.
   De la Garza said the law on food aid, passed in 1954 under
President Eisenhower, was designed originally to fight communism.
   ``What do we do now that we're playing tennis with Mr. Gorbachev
every day?'' he asked.
   Alan Larson, deputy assistant secretary of state for economic
and business affairs, said it was important to keep food aid
flexible.
   President Bush has promised $100 million worth to Poland. Larson
said another $150 million worth is expected from the 12 countries
of the European Economic Community.
   ``We are using food aid to fill the gaps and ease the shortages
that are resulting from what we hope will be a transition of Poland
from a centrally planned, communist nation to a free enterprise
democratic system,'' he added.
   ``The flexibility to use our food aid program to support
democracy, as we are doing in Poland, is one of the best features
of our current law,'' Larson said.
   Larson said about half U.S. food aid is now in the form of
grants; the other half is paid for with money lent by the United
States on easy terms.
   ``Today many countries that receive food aid have large debt
service burdens and can no longer afford even those generous
terms,'' he added.
   The United States has provided $35 billion worth of food aid _
over 300 million tons _ over the past 35 years, said Philip L.
Christenson, assistant administrator in the U.S. Agency for
Economic Development.
   The present program _ about $1.5 billion a year _ accounts for
60 percent of all food aid in the world, he added.

<HEAD>Woman Jailed Overnight Because of Overdue Library Books</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORCROSS, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman jailed overnight when she failed to
appear in court to explain overdue library books said she is sure
she returned the books and was never told of the court date.
   Karen Lindsay, 48, said Tuesday she was arrested at her
apartment Friday night and held without bond until she was released
on her own recognizance Saturday.
   Ms. Lindsay said she was asleep when a Gwinnett County sheriff's
deputy arrived with the arrest warrant charging her with failure to
appear in court, which carries a maximum sentence of one year in
jail and a $1,000 fine.
   ``The police were very nice to me and acted quite embarrassed
over the whole ordeal,'' she said.
   John Shelton, director of the Lake Lanier Regional Library
system, said the library has been turning over offenders to the
courts since 1983 to face charges of failure to return library
books.
   ``I sympathize with the lady but most of my sympathy is with the
people,'' he said. ``Taxpayers should not have to pay more for
libraries because of unreturned books.''
   Ms. Lindsay pleaded innocent Monday to a charge of failure to
appear in State Court. No arraignment date had been set.
   She said she was shown a list of four books she allegedly did
not return, but she couldn't remember any of the titles and found
no unreturned library books when she moved recently.
   The library said the books were 15 months overdue, ``but would I
deserve to go to jail because of it?'' Ms. Lindsay asked.
   Ms. Lindsay said authorities knew she never received a summons
to appear in court because it had been returned to them unopened.

<TEXT>
   A Utah congressman appealed to a House panel
Wednesday to approve a $100 million trust fund to pay damages to
``forgotten guinea pigs'' of the West whose health was destroyed by
radiation from government uranium mines and atomic bomb tests.
   Rep. Wayne Owens, D-Utah, said several victims or their
survivors won federal suits in which the judges concluded the
federal government was negligent, only to have the decisions
overturned on appeal because of a law that protects the government
from being sued except in the rarest of instances.
   Republican Sen. Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, who is sponsoring the
legislation in the Senate, said the cost ``will amount to only a
fraction of what the downwinders and miners have spent because of
the problems that the government his caused.''
   Hatch and others have been pushing similar legislation for years
without success.
   Proponents are more hopeful now in the wake of recent
legislation setting up a trust fund for Japanese people locked in
U.S. camps during World War II and another bill providing
assistance to U.S. servicemen exposed to the harmful effects of
atomic radiation while in the line of duty.
   Hatch reminded the House Judiciary subcommittee on
administrative law and governmental relations that Senate approval
in 1985 of a compact with the governments of Micronesia included a
trust fund for victims of fallout from atomic testing in the
Pacific Ocean.
   If the government is willing to provide such treatment for
foreign residents, how can it do less for its own citizens, Hatch
asked.
   Referred to as ``downwinders,'' the people exposed to fallout
from open air nuclear testing in Nevada in the 1950s live mainly in
southern Nevada, southern Utah and northwestern Airzona.
   ``Even more appalling than the plight faced by the downwinders,
if such is possible, is the case of those who mined uranium in
Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona and Utah from 1947 to 1961,'' said
Hatch. ``Even though the government had adequate warning of the
hazards involved, these miners, most of whom were native Americans,
were sent into inadequately ventilated mines with virtually no
instruction regarding the dangers of ionizing radiation.''
   Owens referred to the mining and testing as ``an unnoticed part
of this nation's nuclear Cold War with the Soviets'' and said
earlier congressional investigations concluded that ``the residents
of this region were used as `guinea pigs' in a deadly experiment.''
   He noted that the House Commerce subcommittee on oversight and
investigations recommented a decade ago that ``sufficient evidence
exists for the federal government to accept at least compassionate
responsibility.''
   ``Then, after wringing its hands over the suffering of these
`forgotten guinea pigs,' Congress unfortunately forgot again,''
said Owens, who told the subcommittee his brother-in-law, a former
uranium miner, recently died of lung cancer.
   Assistant Attorney General Stuart M. Gerson, head of the Justice
Department's civil division, said the administration opposes the
legislation ``because it would dramatically change current law by
making the United States subject to unprecedented liability for
implementing policy decisions and functions.''

<TEXT>
   Former Norwegian Foreign Minister Thorvald
Stoltenberg will be nominated to head the scandal-plagued U.N. High
Commission for Refugees, the top U.N. spokesman said Wednesday.
   The former high commissioner, Jean-Pierre Hocke, resigned Oct.
26 over charges he misused a special education fund for refugees in
order to upgrade his air travel to first class.
   Stoltenberg, an international lawyer who also was a Norwegian
defense minister, has been named Norway's new U.N. ambassador but
he has not yet taken up the post. He declined comment on the
possible new appointment in Oslo.
   Francois Giuliani, spokesman for Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar, said the secretary-general intends to nominate the
58-year-old Norwegian.
   ``I do not deny that what you say is correct,'' he told said in
response to a question.
   The General Assembly is expected to choose a new high
commissioner this month, on the recommendation of the
secretary-general.
   ``We hope the election will be short and swift and that no other
candidates will come forward,'' said another U.N. official.
   Hocke, who defeated Stoltenberg for the three-year position in
1986, reportedly had been favored by the U.S. State Department
because he supported the restrictive immigration policies of the
United States and other Western countries.
   Stoltenberg's views on immigration and refugee issues were not
immediately known. The U.N. High Commission For Refugees handles
more than 10 million refugees worldwide, including 5 million Afghan
refugees in Iran and Pakistan, more than 1 million in southern
Africa, 1 million in the Horn of Africa and several hundred
thousand in southeast Asia and Central America.
   Stoltenberg is an international lawyer and was an unsuccessful
candidate in 1986 for the refugee position. He is backed by
Finland, Iceland, Sweden, Norway and Denmark, which are the
second-largest contributors to the refugee agency, paying $84
million while the United States pays $124 million.
   The U.S. State Department had no comment on Stoltenberg's
candidacy.
   Stoltenberg was foreign minister from March 1987 until the Gro
Harlem Bruntland Labor Party government resigned in October. From
1979 to 1981 he was defense minister in two different Labor
governments.
   He was international secretary for Norway's largest labor Union
several times between 1970 and 1983. From 1971 to 1979 he was
undersecretary in the foreign, defense and trade ministries.
   He was deputy consul in San Francisco from 1959 to 1961, later
served in Belgrade and in the Foreign Ministry in Oslo and in Lagos
in 1970.
   Hocke, who had hoped to be reappointed this month, has been
criticized for financial mismanagement and favoritism, including
the use of funds to upgrade his airine flights. Hocke, who is
Swiss, has admitted using the funds to get better airline seats but
denied misusing U.N. funds.
   He and others have said that the fund, although labeled for
``education,'' in fact was intended to help augment his U.N.
salary. A Swiss TV report said internal documents showed Hocke had
drawn $300,000 since 1987 from the education account to upgrade his
flights from business to first class. Only the U.N.
secretary-general is authorized to travel first class. The United
Nations is investigating the matter.
   He had been criticized by staff and by private refugee relief
groups for not opposing the increasingly rigid asylum policies of
the United States, East Germany and other major donors to the
commission.
   In January 1988, Hocke ordered that all 138,000 copies of the
agency's monthly magazine Refugees be burned because it contained
an article critical of West Germany's policies. He said the article
was outdated.

<HEAD>Brothers Charged with Murder, Robbery of Two Women Who Lived Alone</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADISON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two brothers were ordered held without
bond Wednesday on charges they killed two women found stabbed to
death in their ransacked homes.
   Paul Walker, 18, and Teddy Walker, 19, both of Wharton were
charged with murder, robbery and burglary. Boone County Circuit
Judge E. Lee Schlagel Jr. denied bail for the brothers and
scheduled a bond hearing Nov. 16.
   The bloody bodies of Faye Jarrell, 83, and Dorothy Daniels, 68,
were found Sunday morning. An autopsy showed that both women, who
lived alone in modest homes 500 yards apart, had been beaten and
repeatedly stabbed.
   The victims had last been seen about 10:30 p.m. Saturday, when
they left a neighbor's wake at a church in Bald Knob, a rural
community of about 100 people about 25 miles south of Madison.
   Stunned residents said they hadn't locked their doors until a
recent rash of break-ins and vandalism.
   The Walkers had been arrested on unrelated charges Tuesday and
already were in jail when they were charged with the slayings,
sheriff's Cpl. R.A. Miller said.
   ``A lot of witnesses placed them in the area,'' Miller said.
``We had collected some footprints in the immediate and surrounding
areas. ... And we collected one of the suspect's tennis shoes and
matched it with the plaster cast, and it appears to be a match.''
   Investigators believe the brothers broke into both homes, killed
the victims after robbing them, then went to a car wash to clean
off the blood, Miller said.
   ``It's convenient, but weird,'' he said.
   He said the victims' homes are missing some jewelry and cash,
but investigators have not yet placed a dollar estimate on the
missing items.
   Some of the stolen items have been recovered, as have two knives
believed to be the murder weapons, Miller said.
   Officers charged Karen Canterbury, 39, with being an accessory
to murder after the fact, a misdemeanor, for misleading
investigators with false information, Miller said. She was jailed
under $5,000 bond.

   The superpowers announced Wednesday they had
picked waters off Malta for next month's Mediterranean summit as
U.S. officials began preparing President Bush for a session with
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev that they said would produce no
startling breakthroughs.
   A dramatic statement on American television by Gennady
Gerasimov, the Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, that the Dec. 2-3
shipboard summit could mark ``the end of the Cold War'' was
shrugged off as overstatement.
   Gorbachev is unlikely to ask Bush for specific economic
assistance, a well-placed U.S. official said, adding, ``I don't
think we expect substantive results.''
   Even concerning Eastern and Central Europe, where fast-moving
political reform could challenge the Marxist system and the
cohesion of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact, Bush and Gorbachev are
expected only to ``make sure we have good lines of communication,''
said the official, commenting only on condition of anonymity. ``It
is not an area ripe for agreements,'' he said.
   The low-key appraisal of a session Bush declines even to
describe as a summit, stood in sharp contrast to the version
conveyed to the American public by Soviet spokesman Gerasimov.
   ``I think that this meeting can just be the end of the Cold
War,'' he said from Moscow on ``Good Morning America,'' an ABC-TV
program. ``The Cold War will be dumped down to the bottom of the
Mediterranean sea.''
   Administration officials were hewing closely to Bush's
description Tuesday of a feet-up, informal, get-acquainted session
with Gorbachev on American and Soviet naval vessels in order to
``deepen our respective understanding of each other's views.''
   The site, selected with the hope it could be kept at least
partially secluded, was announced simultaneously Wednesday at the
White House and in Moscow.
   Malta is an independent republic consisting of five islands, two
of them uninhabited. It lies 58 miles south of Sicily, 220 miles
north of Libya and 180 miles east of Tunisia.
   For years, Malta had strong ties to Col. Moammar Gadhafi, the
Libyan leader accused by the United States of fomenting bloody acts
of terrorism. But over the past two years the government has taken
a sharp turn and welcomed American investment.
   Preparations for the meeting, initiated in July by Bush and kept
secret from most of the U.S. bureaucracy, began in earnest with
officials of the State Department and the National Security Council
drawing up the issues to be fleshed out in position papers.
   Before Bush packs them in his briefcase, Secretary of State
James A. Baker III and Brent Scowcroft, the president's national
security adviser, will review them and probably highlight specific
items and subjects they feel ought to be stressed.
   The Pentagon and other government offices will be invited to
contribute. But, again emphasizing the limited U.S. summit
expectations, the U.S. official said the National Security Council
would not hold a meeting on the summit during the 4 1@2 weeks
before Bush sees Gorbachev.
   The principal summit topic of discussion is expected to be
Gorbachev's arduous attempt to boost the faltering Soviet economy
through a reconstruction program known as perestroika. It is
spilling over into the political arena, encouraging political
reform at home and in Eastern Europe.
   The Soviet leader is bound to describe in detail to Bush the
problems he faces. But, the officials said, Moscow has given no
indication through diplomatic channels that Gorbachev would ask for
specific technical or other U.S. help.
   The Bush administration has already told Moscow trade barriers
erected by Congress in the Jackson-Vanik Amendment of 1974 will not
be removed until the Soviets complete legislation liberalizing
emigration procedures.
   ``Asking for direct help would not be suitable,'' an official
said. ``It's one thing to talk about your problems. It's another to
appear to be relying on the United States for help. The Soviets are
strongly independent about this.''
   As preparations got under way, favorable reaction from Congress
grew.
   ``It is a good time to have a meeting,'' said Sen. Alan Simpson
of Wyoming, the deputy Republican Senate leader.
   ``I think a saltwater summit is a good idea,'' said Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen, D-Texas. ``An informal meeting at sea could provide the
right atmosphere to get things moving in several channels,
including trade as well as arms control.''
   At this stage, however, Bentsen's expectations did not square
with the administration's modest goals. And that suited Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., perfectly.
   ``I hope that no fundamental decisions of any sort will be
made,'' he said.
   In this vein, Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman,
momentarily referred to the meeting as a summit and than retracted
what he called ``the `S' word.''
   Chuckling, he advised reporters: ``Let's call this `the
meeting,' the `Big M.'''

   Pan American World Airways is demanding
documents and interviews at the CIA and other U.S. agencies seeking
support for its contention that Israel and West Germany warned that
Flight 103 had been targeted by terrorists days before it was blown
from the sky over Scotland.
   The airline also seeks ``all documents'' linking Flight 103 to a
reported Syrian arms merchant whose name came up in the Iran-Contra
affair.
   Flight 103 was blown up last December with 259 people aboard.
The airline is trying to defend itself against more than $300
million in lawsuits filed by families of victims of the explosion,
in which 11 people on the ground were also killed.
   The airline is demanding to interview personnel at U.S.
intelligence and law enforcement agencies about ``warnings from
Mossad,'' an Israeli intelligence agency, ``within the 24-36 hours
before Dec. 21, 1988,'' that Flight 103 was to be hit by
terrorists, according to subpoenas and notices of depositions filed
in federal court.
   Pan Am also wants information about any warnings from the BKA
(West Germany's FBI) ``within the 90 minutes before the scheduled
departure from Frankfurt'' of Flight 103 concerning ``suspicious
activities'' that ``appeared to be taking place'' in the baggage
loading area.
   The airline in addition is subpoenaing any documents
``concerning the activities'' of Monzer Al-Kassar.
   The congressional Iran-Contra committees found that the
organization of Richard Secord had paid $1.5 million to Al-Kassar
to buy weapons in 1985 and 1986. White House aide Oliver North had
enlisted Secord as part of a secret operation to run arms to the
U.S.-backed Nicaraguan Contra guerrillas.
   At the 1987 congressional hearings, Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Texas,
said Al-Kassar had been identified as a Syrian arms merchant whose
associates included the Palestine Liberation Organization's Abu
Abbas. Abbas is accused of masterminding the hijacking of the
Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro, in which an American passenger
died.
   In its papers, filed in late September in New York and
Washington, the airline is seeking ``all documents'' concerning
``photographic and-or video surveillance ... by the BKA ... at Pan
Am's baggage loading area at Frankfurt'' on Dec. 21.
   Pan Am subpoenaed the CIA, the FBI, the National Security
Council, the National Security Agency, the State Department and the
Drug Enforcement Administration, with interviews due to begin in
mid-November.
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said no decision had
been made on whether the government would attempt to quash the
subpoenas against the six federal agencies.
   Runkel said the agencies, ``working in conjunction with the
Department of Justice, are currently collecting and reviewing the
requested data.''
   The Pan Am subpoenas are ``a lot of nonsense'' and a
``diversionary tactic,'' said Lee Kreindler, an attorney
representing the families of the victims aboard Flight 103.
   It's ``probably an exercise by the public relations department
of Pan Am'' that ``won't have any effect'' on his case and ``won't
get anywhere,'' said Kreindler.
   The State Department ``never received any specific and credible
threat against Pan Am 103,'' said State Department deputy spokesman
Richard Boucher.
   The British government has said it received telephone warnings
of a bomb on a U.S. carrier in the weeks prior to Dec. 21, and U.S.
diplomats in Europe had been warned to avoid Pan Am during the
Christmas season.
   Paul Hudson, an Albany, N.Y., lawyer whose 16-year-old daughter
died in the explosion, said his reaction to Pan Am's demand for
data on any advance warning was ``one of shock ... one of dismay,
followed by a furious reaction by most of the relatives.''
   Hudson, chairman of a group called Families of Pan Am Flight
103, also predicted a ``tremendous outcry for accountability'' if
authorities ``knew that this flight or one very close to it was to
be bombed.''
   A CIA spokesman would not comment on the allegations the Mossad
warned the agency of the bombing 24 hours before it happened. CIA
spokesman Mark Mansfield said by telephone from the agency's
McLean, Va., headquarters that the CIA was among U.S. agencies
subpoenaed by Pan Am lawyers.

   The U.N. General Assembly passed a
resolution Wednesday calling on Afghanistan's communist government
and Moslem guerrillas to open negotiations to establish a coalition
government.
   The resolution, adopted by consensus, says a government of
national reconciliation should rule an Afghan nation that is
non-aligned and Islamic.
   The General Assembly has never before ordered the combatants in
the 10-year-old civil war to open peace talks, nor has it specified
the ideological or religious orientation of the resulting
government of national reconciliation.
   ``This was very gratifying for us. Efforts have been going on
for some months to arrive at a consensus,'' said Pakistani
Ambassador Nasim Ahmed. He praised the Soviet Union, United States
and the non-aligned movement for working to reach accord on the
resolution.
   Both the Security Council and General Assembly have previously
focused their peacemaking efforts on conflicts between nations,
rather than any internal crisis.
   The assembly has no power to enforce its resolutions.
   Last week, a delegation of Afghan guerrillas led by Farooq Azam,
representing the government-in-exile, declared they would never
negotiate with or form a government with Afghan President Najib or
any senior officials of his communist party, called the People's
Democratic Party of Afghanistan.
   Najib has called for a cease-fire and talks with the guerrillas
and offered to bring them into his government, conditions they have
rejected.
   The U.N. resolution also welcomes the Soviet Union's completion
of the withdrawal of more than 100,000 troops by Feb. 15, the
deadline for their pullout set by the Geneva Agreements on
Afghanistan.
   That accord, mediated by Diego Cordovez, then a U.N.
undersecretary-general, called for the Soviet withdrawal and
obliged Pakistan and Afghanistan not to interfere in each other's
affairs.
   The guerrillas control most of the countryside in Afghanistan,
but have made little military or diplomatic progress since the
Soviet withdrawal.
   The United States and Pakistan have not recognized their
government-in-exile, organized earlier in February during a
convening of the Afghan guerrillas and refugees in Rawalpindi,
Pakistan.
   Only Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Malaysia and Sudan have recognized
the government of the mujahedeen, or Islamic holy warriors.
   The United States supplies the guerrillas with weapons,
reportedly distributing them through Pakistan's military
intelligence service. Supplies, weapons and reinforcements are sent
from guerrillas camps in Pakistan.
   The guerrillas besieged the eastern city of Jalalabad after the
Soviet withdrawal, but the Afghan army eventually broke the siege.
   Conflicts among various guerrillas factions prevented the groups
from mounting a coordinated attack, just as it has thwarted their
attempts to adopt any coherent political program beyond opposition
to Najib.
   Diplomats said the guerrillas were hoping to take an Afghan city
so they could move their government into Afghan territory,
increasing their chances of winning diplomatic recognition.

   A major earthquake registering 7.1 on the Richter
scale struck off northeastern Honshu Island early today, officials
said. Three coastal villages were ordered evacuated for fear of
tidal waves, officials said.
   There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage from the
quake, which struck at 3:26 a.m. Thursday (1:26 p.m. Wednesday
EST). It was centered about 60 miles off the coast and at a depth
of 20 miles, the Central Meteorological Agency in Tokyo said.
   After the quake, officials closed the major expressway through
the affected region for inspection and overnight trains were
stopped to check the condition of the rails.
   The agency warned of a tsunami, or seismic tidal wave, hitting
coastal towns on northeast Honshu and the northernmost main island
of Hokkaido. The agency said sea levels two hours after the quake
had risen nearly three feet in the region.
   Officials ordered the evacuation of the villages of Taro,
Sanriku and Ozutsu, about 300 miles northeast of Tokyo on Honshu's
eastern coast.
   The agency said the quake had a magnitude of 7.1 on the Richter
scale, the same as the Oct. 17 earthquake that devastated the San
Francisco Bay area. In Washington, the U.S. Geological Survey said
the quake measured 7.3 on the Richter scale.
   U.S. Geological Survey scientists said they recorded an
aftershock measuring 5.8 about 10 minutes after the main quake.
   The main earthquake was the strongest in that region in more
than 58 years, since a magnitude 7.7 earthquake March 9, 1931, said
Don Finley, a spokesman for the U.S. agency.
   The earthquake occurred in the same general area as a series of
earlier tremors during the past several weeks. The strongest of the
earlier quakes was a magnitude 6.5 on Sunday.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of
tremendous damage.
   Japan is situated on a major fault line that produces frequent
earthquakes, few of which cause serious damage.

   Prosecutors said Wednesday that 120
radical students and dissidents have been charged with anti-U.S.,
anti-government protests and ideological links to North Korea.
   The Public Prosecutors' Office said charges have been brought
against 82 radical students and 38 dissidents who allegedly armed
themselves with North Korea's revolutionary ideas to overthrow
South Korea.
   Prosecutors said the 120 radicals have been caught in a
five-month crackdown. They said about 40,000 pro-North Korean books
have been seized this year.
   The prosecutors pledged a ``systematic and steady'' crackdown,
saying pro-North Korean forces have instigated violent protests
calling for the withdrawal of U.S. troops based in South Korea
under a mutual defense pact.
   Government officials claimed radicals have used campuses to
disseminate pro-North Korean ideas and attacked U.S. military and
diplomatic facilities to dramatize their campaign.
   Radical students, a powerful minority on campuses, have failed
to earn broad support because of their violent tactics and
ideological extremism since President Roh Tae-woo took office in
February 1988 and carried out reforms.

Job</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former University of Nebraska President Ronald
W. Roskens, fired by his board of regents in July, Wednesday was
picked by President Bush on Wednesday to head the Agency for
International Development.
   Bush will nominate Roskins to the post left vacant by the death
last June of AIDS Administrator M. Alan Woods, White House Press
Secretary Marlin Fitzwater announced.
   The University of Nebraska Board of Regents terminated Roskens'
contract July 31 after 12 years as president of the University of
Nebraska System. The regents have refused to say why, despite
demands for an explanation from legislators.
   The regents did say the ouster had nothing to do with any fiscal
or moral impropriety. Some university sources, speaking on
condition of anonymity, have suggested there was a personality
clash between Roskens and several regents.
   Roskens, 56, told a news conference in Lincoln, Neb., ``I would
simply tell you that I am elated.'' He declined to discuss his
dismissal from the university, saying, ``We have long since put
that behind us.''
   Roskens, if confirmed by the Senate, Roskens will run an agency
with 4,600 employees who administer $7 billion in annual U.S.
economic and foreign assistance in more than 60 countries.
   Roskens is a past chairman of the American Council on Education,
the main lobbying arm in Washington for the nation's more than
3,000 colleges and universities.
   The Iowa native was an education professor and vice president at
Kent State University in Ohio before coming to Nebraska as
chancellor of the University of Nebraska at Omaha in 1972. In 1977,
he became president of the Nebraska system, which now includes
three institutions, 40,000 students and a budget of nearly $700
million.
   Roskens said the AID post is ``very appealing in large part
because of the activities I have engaged in in the past'' in
international affairs.
   While chancellor at the Omaha campus, Roskens engineered a
contract with AID to finance an exchange program with the
University of Kabul in Afghanistan.
   Later, as system president, he oversaw campus initiatives for
AID contracts that included a $30 million project by the Omaha
campus to provide educational support for children in Afghanistan
and Afghan refugees in Pakistan.

<HEAD>Colonel Who Led Revolt Ordered to Retire</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED McCULLOUGH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A colonel who led a military
revolt last year against the government of former President Raul
Alfonsin was ordered Wednesday to retire.
   Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin led the December 1988 uprising to
protest the government's decision to prosecute officers accused of
human rights abuses during the 1976-83 dictatorship.
   Rebels also demanded a more money for the military and a shakeup
of the military command.
   Seineldin has been held under military arrest since the failed
rebellion. His promotion to brigadier general was turned down by
the army's Promotions Board last week.
   Because he was passed over, he could not remain in the army and
was ordered retired, said army chief Gen. Isidro Caceres.
   The 54-year-old career soldier distinguished himself in fighting
against leftist subversives trying to overthrow Argentina's
government in the early 1970s, and against the British during the
74-day war in 1982 over the Falkland Islands.
   Seineldin and the others may appeal for reinstatement to Defense
Minister Italo Luder and Menem, who succeeded Alfonsin this year.
   On Oct. 7, Menem pardoned Seineldin and 173 other rebels whose
three insurrections threatened to destabilize the Alfonsin
government.
   Also pardoned were 39 officers accused of kidnapping, torture
and murder during the dictatorship and about 60 leftist guerrillas.
   The pardons were necessary, Menem said, to end military
grievances and achieve ``national reconciliation'' between the
armed forces and society's other important institutions.
   Tensions between the army and leftist and human rights groups
has simmered since Alfonsin took office in December 1983 over
issues such as the military budget, the human rights trials and the
army's role in domestic intelligence surveillance.
   The lack of common ground between them undermined popular
support for the Alfonsin government.
   Menem made no mention of the retirements when he addressed about
300 officers Wednesday, but said the actions of his government,
which took office on July 8, would ``close a chapter'' in Argentine
history.
   ``Today begins the reconstruction of the glorious army of the
nation,'' he said.
   Newspapers in the capital Buenos Aires reported Wednesday that
Seineldin, a former commando, might be given the quasi-military
assignment of forming an anti-terrorist, rapid deployment force
comprised of about 400 soldiers, federal police and border guards.

<HEAD>Officials Say Inspection Could Not Have Detected Disk Flaw</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SEERY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SIOUX CITY, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The crack in the fan disk of a jet that
crashed killing 112 people probably existed when the disk was last
inspected in 1988, an expert testified Wednesday, but a United
Airlines official said testing required at the time could not have
detected the flaw.
   United spokesman Robert Doughty said that since the July 19
crash of the airline's DC-10 jumbo jet at the Sioux Gateway
Airport, the Federal Aviation Administration has ordered ultrasonic
examination of all disks similar to the titanium disk that split
apart in the tail engine of Flight 232.
   Ultrasonic testing can detect cracks and other flaws beneath the
surface of a block of material. Before the Sioux City crash,
surface testing of disks was deemed adequate.
   ``If the ultrasonic testing had been required, it (the crack)
would have been discovered,'' Doughty said during a break in
testimony at the National Transportation Safety Board hearing.
   The crash occurred as the crew of the crippled plane attempted
an emergency landing after the plane's rear engine disintegrated
over northwest Iowa. Metal spewing out of the engine severed all
three of the plane's hydraulic systems, rendering the aircraft
nearly uncontrollable.
   The rear engine's huge fan disk was found in two sections in
northwest Iowa farm fields and initial tests found a crack one-half
inch deep and just more than one inch long in the larger section of
the disk, according to an NTSB report.
   NTSB chief metallurgist James Wildey II also testified Wednesday
that the crack is visible to the unaided eye and appears to have
existed before the disk broke apart, but he said he does not know
how long it had existed.
   Chris Glynn, a design engineer for General Electric Co., which
made the engine, testified that tests by his company indicate the
crack would have been present when the fan disk was brought in for
routine testing by United Airlines in February 1988. He estimated
that the crack would have been about one-quarter inch deep when the
disk was tested. Glynn said ultrasonic testing might have been
needed to detect the crack.
   Doughty said the crack could not have been at the disk surface
in February 1988. He said the testing procedure used at that time,
involving coating the disk with a dye, would have revealed any
surface imperfections.
   ``It is our feeling, at least based on information available at
this time, that the crack was not on the surface,'' Doughty said.
   Six other DC-10 engine disks made from the same block of
titanium as the Flight 232 disk have been recalled for testing
since the crash. Wildey said a possible flaw has been detected in
one of them.

<HEAD>Collection Of Priceless Papal Gifts, Commissions Comes To Baltimore</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEX DOMINGUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A collection of priceless religious items that
popes from the Middle Ages to the Baroque era commissioned or
received as gifts goes on display Thursday, the first time many
have been seen in the United States.
   The exhibit at the Walters Art Gallery commemorates the
bicentenntial of the Baltimore Archdiocese and the beginnings of
the Roman Catholic hierarchy in this country.
   ``Since we are celebrating the presence of the papacy on
American shores, every object has been commissioned by or given to
the pope,'' said Robert Bergman, director of the public museum.
   The collection consists of nearly 30 works, most of them created
for use in the Vatican's Sistine Chapel, the papal household's
private chapel.
   It includes a ninth-century gold enameled reliquary cross said
to have held pieces of the cross on which Christ was crucified, and
one of the most important medieval enamel objects in existence.
   Also in the collection are two tapestries designed by Raphael,
gold-threaded vestments made for Pope Clement VII (1523-1534) and
several illuminated manuscripts.
   About half the items have never been displayed in the United
States, and most have never been seen together, Bergman said.
   The exhibit, ``Splendor of the Popes: Treasures from the Sistine
Chapel and the Vatican Museums and Library,'' runs through Jan. 7
and is the culmination of two years of negotiations.
   ``It was sort of an elegant ballet of courtesies,'' Bergman
said. ``The negotiations took place on a clerical and
museum-professional level. We benefited from intervention from the
highest levels of the church.''
   The tapestries, vestments, artworks, crucifixes and manuscripts
have been arranged to resemble a chapel. A mock altar has been set
up at the head of the exhibit with tapestries and vestments along
the walls and religious manuscripts and other items in the center.
   ``The exhibit gives you the impression of the cascading levels
of embellishment of the Sistine Chapel that would have descended
from Michelangelo's frescoes,'' Bergman said.
   The two 15-foot tapestries designed by Raphael depict the
stoning of St. Stephen and the conversion of St. Paul, and are part
of a set of 10 made to be hung below Michelangelo's frescoes on the
Sistine Chapel's ceiling.
   ``Raphael's designs for the Sistine tapestries are considered
his most perfected and heroic works,'' Bergman said. ``The
monumental scale of Raphael's figures and their highly energized
character were clearly influenced by Michelangelo's recently
completed ceiling frescoes.''
   The tapestries have had eventful histories. Stolen twice and
taken as far Paris and Constantinople, they were reassembled during
the reign of Pope Paul III (1534-1549). In 1932, Pope Pius XI had
them placed in the Raphael Gallery of the Vatican Museums.
   The reliquary cross was made for Pope Paschal (817-824), and is
one of the Vatican's most precious treasures. It is the highlight
of the Sancta Sanctorum Treasure, a collection of objects and
relics found in the private chapel of the Lateran Basilica, the
seat of the papacy before the 14th century.
   Both the tapestries and the reliquary have never been seen in
the United States.

<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who has served nine years of a life
sentence for a fur robbery she said she didn't commit had her
conviction overturned Wednesday by an appeals court.
   The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals said Joyce Ann Brown was
wrongly convicted in the 1980 robbery because prosecutors failed
``either negligently or inadvertently'' to disclose evidence that
could have tainted the credibility of their primary witness.
   ``I have been fighting for nine years and I knew that one day
the world would know that I was innocent. I am thrilled,'' Ms.
Brown said by telephone from prison in Gatesville.
   Rubin Danziger, owner of the Dallas fur store, was fatally shot
during the robbery May 6, 1980. Another woman, Renee Taylor,
pleaded guilty to the murder and is serving a life sentence.
   Ms. Brown, 42, was convicted in October 1980 of aggravated
robbery and sentenced to life in prison based mostly on the
testimony of Martha Bruce, who said Ms. Brown confessed to the
crime while the two were in jail together.
   Ala Danziger, who is the store owner's widow, identified Ms.
Brown as taking part in the robbery, but Ms. Brown's then-employer
and co-workers said she was on the job at the time.
   Ms. Bruce had been convicted of lying to a police officer, a
felony, but prosecutors did not bring that up during Ms. Brown's
trial.
   During a September hearing, a lower court recommended Ms. Brown
be granted a new trial. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals agreed,
saying Ms. Brown was ``denied a fair trial and due process of law''
because Ms. Bruce's history could have damaged her credibility as a
witness.
   Norm Kinne, an assistant Dallas County district attorney who
helped prosecute Ms. Brown, said she will be tried again.
   ``I have nothing to hide. I am ready to go back to court,'' Ms.
Brown said.
   The appeals court ordered her release from prison and placed in
the custody of the Dallas County Sheriff's Department. The transfer
could take several days.

<TEXT>
   John F. Kennedy Jr., a recently hired prosecutor
in the Manhattan district attorney's office, has failed the state
bar examination, a spokesman for the office said Wednesday.
   The spokesman, Gerald McKelvey, said a 10-year-old office policy
allows Kennedy, son of the slain president, two more chances to
take the exam and pass. If he fails the third time, he will be
asked to resign from his $30,000-a-year job, McKelvey said. The
next exam is in February.
   Meanwhile, Kennedy will continue to work as he has since August.
Under the state rules, Kennedy may handle misdemeanor cases in
Manhattan Criminal Court and certain felony matters under the
supervision of an admitted attorney.
   A graduate of New York University Law School, Kennedy, 28, was
among 69 new prosecutors hired in Manhattan last summer. He is
assigned to the special prosecutions unit which handles cases such
as consumer fraud.
   Kennedy was one of about 7,000 candidates who took the bar exam.
About 70 percent passed, according to the New York Law Journal. The
list of those who passed will be posted Thursday.
   McKelvey said that of the 63 in the district attorney's office
who took the exam, seven, including Kennedy, failed.
   McKelvey said Kennedy's cousin, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., failed
the bar exam in 1983 when he took it the first time during the 11
months he worked for Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau.
He was admitted in 1985.
   If Kennedy passes the bar, he will get a $1,000 a year raise.

   The Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee
on Wednesday rejected the nomination of Debra R. Bowland to head
the Labor Department's wage and hour division, citing her work to
overturn a Louisiana wage law covering government contracts.
   ``We shouldn't put somebody in charge of a law that they don't
believe in _ period,'' said Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., one of the
nine senators to vote against the nomination. Six voted for it.
   ``This is putting the fox in charge of the chicken coop,'' said
Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., another opponent.
   Bowland had been Louisian's Secretary of Labor from 1980 to 1982
under Dave Treen, the only Republican governor in Louisiana in
modern history. She opposed the law under his administration.
Later, as a lobbyist, she represented the opposition to the
prevailing wage law, which was eventually repealed.
   ``Prevailing wage'' laws require government contractors to pay
the prevailing wage in the area of the work, and those wages
generally are defined by reference to union pay scales.
   Bowland would have been in charge of enforcing the federal
prevailing wage law, the Davis-Bacon Act.
   Bowland supporters said she has pledged to enforce federal laws
``vigorously'' and should be taken at her word. Sen. James M.
Jeffords, R-Vt., said Bowland's opppositon to the Louisiana law was
based on problems with the way it was being carried out and
regulations derived from it.
   They noted that the repeal occurred after her involvement and
under a Democratic administration.
   But Sens. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the committee,
and Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, both said it was clear from the
campaign in Louisiana that Bowland has a philosophical objection to
government involvement in wage and hour regulation.
   ``You have to ask yourself whether she is going to be committed
to the implementation of this legislation,'' said Kennedy. ``I find
it difficult to give her the benefit of the doubt.''
   Bowland, 45, has been with the Labor Department since 1985 and
heads the Women's Bureau.
   Sen. Dave Durenberger, R-Minn., abstained. His spokesman said it
was because Durenberger had serious reservations about the
nomination but thought the president should be able to pick his
nominees.

   The State Department on Wednesday denounced
terrorist attacks on civilian targets in El Salvador that left 10
people dead and dozens injured.
   In one incident, three people, including an American were
injured in a bombing at the office of a group that represents
families of the victims of violence in El Salvador.
   Subsequently, 10 union activists were killed and 29 were wounded
in the bombing of a union headquarters.
   Deputy spokesman Richard Boucher declined to assess blame for
the incidents but criticized extremists of both the left and the
right for continuing to engage in politically-motivated violence.
   Boucher called them ``reprehensible acts'' and condemned them in
the ``strongest possible terms.''
   ``The violent extreme on the left and the right seek power
through violence and terror,'' he said.
   ``The extreme left murders Salvadorans in the name of order. But
the extreme left and right in El Salvador bring neither liberation
nor order, they bring suffering, terror and death. We condemn these
acts of violence.''
   He said attacks were the work of terrorists and murderers, and
``we vigorously denounce them. Violence only serves the interests
of extremists who oppose democracy and national reconciliation.''

   Scientists have made tobacco plants produce an
animal protein, an ability that may one day make plants useful for
soaking up pollutants, a study says.
   Animal proteins may also eventually help make plants resist
disease or produce higher levels of useful substances, said
researcher Andrew Hiatt.
   The work is reported in Thursday's issue of the British journal
Nature by Hiatt and colleagues at the Research Institute of Scripps
Clinic in La Jolla, Calif.
   Another scientist cautioned that ideas about potential uses are
only speculation.
   The researchers made tobacco plants produce antibodies, a kind
of protein best known for its role in the body's immune system.
Antibodies latch on to specific germs as one step in fighting
disease.
   The plants produced the antibodies because researchers had given
them genetic material based on mouse genes.
   Researchers experimented with a type of tobacco that is not used
for smoking, Hiatt said. While it lends itself to laboratory work,
other plants such as beans would be better suited for large-scale
production of antibodies, he said Wednesday in a telephone
interview.
   Antibodies bind to specific substances while ignoring others,
which suggests that antibody-bearing plants might be able to trap
pollutants, Hiatt said.
   For example, a large quantity of such plants might be harvested
and used for filtering river water that carries a low level of a
suitable pollutant, he said.
   Plant antibodies might also fend off plant diseases, make a
plant produce higher levels of useful substances by altering its
biochemistry, or serve as a relatively inexpensive source of
antibodies for medical use, he said.
   But Peter Day, director of the Center for Agricultural Molecular
Biology in New Brunswick, N.J., said relatively simple technologies
already exist for filtering out pollutants.
   He also noted that the antibodies had not yet been shown capable
of fighting plant diseases by binding to microbes.
   The Nature paper is ``quite an interesting piece of work,'' he
said. ``It hasn't gone far enough to show exactly what the
potentials are, and what are the problems that remain to be
solved.'''

<HEAD>House Votes $3.2 Billion Increase in Drug War</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The House on Wednesday voted to step up
spending in the war against drugs by almost $3.2 billion, $900
million more than what President Bush requested when he launched
the campaign almost two months ago.
   The money represents the major congressional contribution to the
war against drugs this year, and lawmakers said it was urgently
needed to combat the scourge of illicit narcotics.
   ``It's destroying our morals, its destroying our lives,''
Appropriations Committee Chairman Jamie Whitten, D-Miss., declared
as the House approved the funding increase on a voice vote.
   The money was included in a transportation money bill fashioned
by a House-Senate conference committee and the overall measure must
be acted upon by the Senate before going to the president's desk
for his signature.
   The measure would add almost $3.2 billion in spending to the war
against drugs, bringing the total to $8.8 billion for the fiscal
year that began Oct.
   Contained in the new funding package is $1 billion for the
federal prison system for buildings, $308 million for justice
assistance block grants and $727 million for programs involving
alcohol, drug abuse and mental health.
   Everything in the package except for a few details was worked
out between the administration and Senate negotiators in September,
and the measure moved easily through the House.
   A number of non-money portions of the anti-drug package were
dropped in the conference committee, with House members saying the
Senate should never have put them in a money bill.
   They ranged from requiring states to have drug programs to
laying the groundwork for stepped up aid to Andean nations. House
leaders said lawmakers would consider them later.
   The sole snag in House action on the bill came Tuesday when Rep.
William Frenzel, R-Minn., blocked an immediate vote, saying the
measure violated the budget act. Sponsors retreated to the House
Rules Committee and obtained permission for action on the bill
despite that objection.
   Under the plan, spending would be offset by cuts in other
programs, leading sponsors to call it ``deficit neutral.'' They
brushed aside Frenzel's complaint that the levels were still too
high.
   ``We can have a balanced budget and a whole lot of other things
at the expense of our economy and our whole country,'' said Whitten.
   Rep. Bill Alexander, D-Ark., said the important thing was to
make the money available to combat the problem.
   ``We have lost control of the streets, of the schools and of the
workplaces to the drug lords who have gotten control of this
country,'' Alexander said.
   ``Spend we will do,'' declared Rep. Silvio Conte, R-Mass. ``This
is no paltry, penny-pinching response.''

   Fifteen days after the destructive Bay area
earthquake, a mock disaster staged Wednesday tested Southern
California's ability to cope with the inevitable shaker and
incumbent calamity.
   ``No longer is it a question of if we will be forced to deal
with a major disaster, but when we will have to respond,'' said Los
Angeles Sheriff Sherman Block, whose job in a real quake is to
coordinate resources countywide.
   The drill, designed to examine earthquake readiness and the
response of emergency services for a 7.0-magnitude quake, follows
the Oct. 17 San Francisco Bay area temblor that measured 7.1 on the
Richter scale.
   ``It looks like it went down pretty smooth, as far as the game
plan goes,'' said sheriff's Deputy Hal Grant.
   Hundreds of disaster officials from 72 municipalities
participated in the ``Disaster Response '89'' exercise,
implementing some of the lessons learned during the Northern
California quake.
   City Council member Gloria Molina said: ``We looked at the
devastation of San Francisco and said, `What would happen here?'''
   Scientists say a major earthquake, the so-called Big One, will
likely occur along the southern San Andreas Fault within the next
three decades.
   In the fake-quake scenario, the ground shuddered for 30 seconds
throughout Southern California. Buildings and freeway overpasses
collapsed, an oil refinery exploded in flames and fuel lines
ruptured.
   Participants weren't told exactly when the pretend disaster
would strike, only that it would occur sometime this week.
   The simulated quake occurred at 6 a.m. along the
Newport-Inglewood Fault and damage was extensive from Marina del
Rey to Long Beach, according to the scenario. There were many
deaths and hundreds were trapped in rubble.
   Simulated search and rescue operations took place at the city
Fire Department's training center, where a state-of-the-art
collapsible building contained trapped ``victims.''
   There were also ``rescues'' from automobiles, a collapsed trench
and a water tower.
   Police and fire departments, federal and state agencies, public
utilities and private companies participated in the drill.

   Former Salvadoran President Jose Napoleon
Duarte, suffering from cancer for the past 16 months, may have only
a few days to live, an administration official said Wednesday.
   Duarte, who completed a five-year term in office in June, was
admitted to Walter Reed Army Hospital last Saturday. He was
diagnosed as having cancer of the liver in June 1988 and has
undergone treatment at Walter Reed many times since then. The
hospital had no comment on his condition.
   At El Salvador's embassy, press aide Eduardo Torres said that
Duarte arrived in Washington last Friday and ``he's in bad shape.''
   The tenative plan is for Duarte to remain at the hospital for
about two more days and then return to El Salvador, said the
administration official, who asked not to be identified.
   The official said President Bush is expected to take part in a
ceremony Thursday at the hospital in which a scholarship at Notre
Dame University, Duarte's alma mater, will be set up in his name.

   The State Department is revamping the visas it
grants foreigners in order to make them harder to counterfeit, a
consular official told Congress on Wednesday.
   The changes are also designed to prevent criminals from entering
the United States with another person's visa, said Richard H.
Williams of the State Department's Burea of Consular Affairs.
   He testified before a House immigration subcommittee discussing
the problems of identifying and deporting illegal aliens who commit
crimes in the United States.
   Williams said a system was already in place in 32 ``of our
highest fraud posts'' abroad, such as Mexico, to prevent forgeries
by issuing a ``printed stamp with security features that are
difficult to counterfeit.'' The new more secure visas will be
introduced in 1990, he said.
   In September, the State Department also introduced a pilot
program of visas readable by special sensors. The new visa has a
digitized photograph of the applicant and other information about
the person, and can be read by special machines installed at U.S.
airports, Williams said.

<HEAD>Salinas Announces End Of Recession in Mexico</HEAD>

   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari told
Mexico on Wednesday that its long recession has bottomed out and
the economy is growing again.
   ``We are resuming growth at a faster rate than expected and even
at a faster pace than is desirable,'' he said in his first state of
the nation address.
   He told a joint session of Congress that inflation is down
sharply, negotiations are nearly complete to reduce the burdensome
foreign debt, exports are up and economic growth is expected to
reach 2.5 to 3 percent by the end of the year.
   Salinas said the government is becoming leaner and more
efficient because of his efforts to reduce government controls over
the economy and sell off dozens of state companies and monopolies.
   A ``decade of crisis has damaged the living standards of the
population in an unprecedented way,'' Salinas said. He said the
biggest problem was feeding Mexico's 86 million people following
two years of dry weather.
   The president said he put high priority on law enforcement and
combating corruption long entrenched in the government, ``to show
that no individual or group can be above the law.''
   ``Impunity generates corruption and arrogance and goes against
the interests of society,'' he declared.
   Salinas put heavy emphasis on modernizing Mexico's economy,
selling off state-owned companies and shedding government controls
that he says stifle production and private enterprise.
   ``The crisis showed us that a larger state is not necessarily a
more capable state; a state that owns more is today not a fairer
state,'' he declared, reversing his party's traditional policy.
   He was interrupted several times by applause, but opposition
members stood and jeered when he spoke of election reform.
   Sen. Porfirio Munoz Ledo, a leader of the center-left
Revolutionary Democratic Party, spoke before Salinas and raked the
government for deciding to ``liquidate the public economy.''
   Abel Vinicio Tovar, a leader of the conservative National Action
Party, said he could not forget that the government frustrated
``hundreds of thousands of voters'' in western Michoacan state.
Salinas' Institutional Revolutionary Party _ popularly known as the
PRI _ denies accusations that it stole July 2 state assembly
elections there.
   Salinas said the PRI has ``the political and moral imperative of
returning to the original meaning'' of the 1910-20 revolution.
   Salinas, 41, was elected in July 1988 by the slimmest margin in
PRI history amid cries of fraud.
   The party lost a governorship for the first time last July, when
Ernesto Ruffo of National Action was elected in Baja California.
Salinas arranged to fly to Mexicali to attend Ruffo's inauguration
Wednesday night.
   Salinas promised to end election fraud when he took office Dec.
1 for a six-year term.
   Left-wing opponents argue that a recent reform law does not do
enough to ensure fair elections and will merely entrench the PRI.
   Munoz Ledo called Salinas' speech ``very autocratic'' and told
reporters Salinas was ``following the tradition of a monologue'' by
the executive branch.
   But Ruffo said he believed Salinas's speech was ``truly
positive. ... We are opening up toward citizen participation'' in
government decision-making.
   After sustained growth averaging 5 percent annually in the 1960s
and '70s, the economy nose-dived in the early 1980s when prices
plunged on the world market for crude oil, Mexico's main export.
   Economic ills followed _ inflation, unemployment, a drop in
earning power of wages by about half _ coupled with Mexico's
inability to make payments on its foreign debt, second largest in
the developing world behind Brazil at $107 billion.
   Salinas' administration has pushed a trend to export
diversification in an effort to reduce Mexico's dependence on oil,
and Salinas said growth in imports had slowed to a 14 percent
annual rate.
   He spoke in the Palace of Fine Arts because the Chamber of
Deputies is still under repair after a fire.
   About 10,000 demonstrators, including many union members,
marched toward the palace but were turned onto side streets by
police without incident.

<TEXT>
   President-elect Turgut Ozal resigned from
the political party he founded and pledged Wednesday that he will
stay above party politics after leaving the premiership for his new
non-partisan post.
   ``I will do my duty as stipulated in the constitution,'' Ozal
told a news conference a day after his election by Parliament.
``Politics is gone.''
   Ozal was elected president Tuesday on a third ballot with the
votes of 263 Motherland deputies in a Parliament session boycotted
by all 155 opposition deputies.
   Opposition parties claimed Ozal, founder and leader of the
Motherland Party, lacked a popular mandate after the defeat of his
party in nationwide polls in March. They also questioned whether he
could rule without being influenced by his role in party politics,
as required by the constitution.
   Ozal, set to become Turkey's first civilian head of state with
an active political background since 1960, said he had resigned
from his party.
   Ozal's premiership came to an end after his election. Deputy
Premier Ali Bozer has been appointed acting premier by the outgoing
President Kenan Evren.
   Ozal said he would name a Motherland deputy to form a new
government after he takes over from Evren Nov. 9. Ozal became
premier in 1983 when his newly formed party won elections that
restored civilian rule.
   Hasan Celal Guzel, a former education minister, on Wednesday
became the first Motherland deputy to announce his candidacy for
party leadership, which will be decided in a party congress Nov.
17. Guzel said the premier and the party chairman must be the same
person in accordance with party tradition.
   Ozal said, however, he will not wait until the party congress to
appoint a premier.
   Other aspirants include Foreign Minister Mesut Yilmaz, Finance
Minister Ekrem Pakdemirli and Justice Minister Oltan Sungurlu.

<HEAD>Experts Propose Scaled-down Version of Temporary Nuke Waste Dump</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A panel of private experts told Congress
Wednesday the nation should build a small facility to store wastes
from nuclear power plants until a permanent dump is opened.
   The recommendation, following 18 months of study by the
three-man panel, drew immediate criticism from both supporters and
opponents of long-stalled plans for building an interim facility to
store spent uranium from the plants.
   Nuclear utilities, which support the idea of an interim storage
site, called the recommendation too limited, while
environmentalists and other opponents said it skirted the central
issue of safely managing nuclear waste in the long run.
   The panel was created by Congress in 1987 to reassess an Energy
Department plan for building a large-scale interim waste storage
site in Tennessee. It rejected key aspects of the department's
proposal but accepted the need for an interim facility.
   It also recommended building a smaller facility to hold nuclear
waste in emergencies such as a reactor accident. This would not be
intended for general waste storage.
   The review panel made no recommendations on where an interim
storage facility should be situated, but members of the Tennesee
congressional delegation were quick to say the group was wrong to
have concluded that any such facilities are needed.
   ``Its recommendations are as wrongheaded as the Department of
Energy's original plans,'' Tennessee's Democratic Sens. Albert Gore
and Jim Sasser said in a joint statement.
   The state of Tennessee sued the Energy Department to stop its
original plan to build a facility, known as the Monitored
Retreivable Storage site, near Oak Ridge, Tenn.
   Tennessee and other opponents of interim storage contend, among
other things, that other states' unwillingness to be host to a
permament waste dump would mean any temporary storage site would
risk being stuck with the waste indefinitely.
   A desert site in Nevada is under study by the Energy Department
as a proposed permanent waste dump, but the state is attempting to
stop the project. Congress has not authorized the department to
study any other permanent sites.
   In its report to Congress, the review panel recommended building
an interim waste storage facility about one-third as big as that
proposed by the Energy Department and said it should be constructed
only if enough nuclear utilities agree to put up the money. The
department plan called for all utilities to pay the cost.
   The panel said its proposed storage facility would cost $500
million to $600 million.
   The group also rejected the idea, incorporated in the 1987
Nuclear Waste Amendments Act that created the review panel, that
the start of construction of an interim facility be held up until
plans for a permanent dump were licensed.
   It said such a linkage would, because of delays in the building
the permanent dump, force some utilities to close down license
reactors because of a lack of waste storage capacity.
   The Edison Electric Institute, representing the nation's
investor-owned utilities, said Congress should reject the panel's
idea of a scaled-down storage facility and instead go back to a
more flexible version of the Energy Department's original plan.
   Public Citizen, the consumer and anti-nuclear group, said the
panel's recommendation fudged the central issue of ensuring that
all nuclear waste can be safely disposed of in the long run.
   ``They tried to give a little something to everyone and they
ended up givng nothing much to anybody,'' said Scott Saleska, a
nuclear policy analyst at Public Citizen.

<HEAD>House OKs Smoking Ban; Sends Bill Back To Senate</HEAD>

   The House completed final action Thursday on
legislation containing a provision banning most airline smoking and
sent the measure to the Senate.
   The prohibition is part of a compromise House-Senate bill
providing $12 billion for transportation and $3.2 billion for
anti-drug programs for the fiscal year that started Oct. 1.
   The chamber actually had voted Tuesday to forbid smoking on all
routes in the continental United States and on all flights to and
from Hawaii and Alaska scheduled for six hours or less. On
Thursday, it finished action on the transportation appropriations
bill by voice vote, also approving separate provisions involving
spending for anti-drug abuse programs.
   The anti-smoking language in the $15.2 billion bill would allow
passengers to light up on just 28 U.S. flights _ 24 to Alaska and
Hawaii and four to Guam _ of 17,500 the airline industry says are
scheduled daily, according to sponsor Rep. Richard Durbin, D-Ill.
The ban would take effect 96 days after the measure is signed into
law.
   ``In February or March of next year, airline passengers across
America can finally start to breathe a little easier,'' Durbin said.
   Current law bans smoking on domestic flights of two hours or
less.
   Durbin said the proposed smoking restrictions, which the House
adopted on a voice vote and with little debate, indicate a shift in
federal policy toward the tobacco industry. The next target, he
said, could be cigarette company advertising aimed at attracted
young new smokers.
   ``Our agenda must move forward,'' Durbin said.

   It's been a bad week for the Navy.
   Starting with the Sunday jet crash that claimed five lives on
the USS Lexington and continuing through Wednesday's fire aboard
the oiler USS Monongahela, each day has brought another mishap at
sea that has Navy brass shaking their heads _ and hoping it's just
a streak of bad luck.
   One civilian specialist on industrial hazards warns that
cutbacks in Navy training could lead to more accidents.
   ``Congress is always trying to cut training budgets. But if a
pilot can't practice flying, those on the deck don't get trained
either. ... It's a prescription for an accident,'' said Karlene
Roberts, an industrial psychologist participating in a five-year
study of Nimitz-class aircraft carriers and hazardous industrial
systems.
   She said, however, that overall the Navy's safety record ``is
excellent.''
   ``Operating at sea is an arduous life, and the lesson is that
even at peacetime there are dangers,'' said Rear Adm. Brent Baker,
the head of the Navy's information division.
   ``That's no consolation to the families who have lost sons or
daughters. But those who have been around the Navy a long time
realize that's why we train so hard and emphasize safety. ... You
can't prepare for war at the pier,'' said Baker.
   ``It's frustrating. It's a real streak of bad luck,'' he said.
   In the latest incident, the Navy reported that nine sailors
suffered smoke inhalation and four of those were treated for burns
following an early morning fire in a boiler aboard the USS
Monongahela, some 500 miles west of Gibraltar.
   The other incidents include:
   _Three sailors and a reported $4 million worth of non-nuclear
missiles were swept by a wave from the aircraft carrier USS
Eisenhower near Cape Hatteras, N.C. on Tuesday, with one sailor
still missing and presumed dead.
   _A sailor aboard the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson fell into
the Pacific about 620 miles north of Wake Island late Monday and
was presumed lost.
   _A F@A-18 pilot dropped a 500-pound bomb on the guided missile
cruiser USS Reeves in the Indian Ocean also on Monday, causing
minor injuries to five sailors and blowing a five-foot hole in the
ship's bow.
   _In the week's most deadly event, a jet pilot making his first
landing on an aircraft carrier crashed into the USS Lexington in
the Gulf of Mexico on Sunday, killing him and four others on the
deck of the huge ship.
   The accidents bear down on the Navy at a time when the service
has been under intense scrutiny for its controversial report on the
April explosion aboard the USS Iowa, in which 47 sailors were
killed.
   Critics have found fault with the Navy's report, which concluded
that gunner's mate Clayton Hartwig was the ``most likely'' person
to have used an explosive device to touch off the fireball in the
ship's 16-inch guns.
   On Sunday, a Washington Post editorial accused the service of
having ``not a shred of evidence'' to back up its claim against
Hartwig. Meanwhile, the General Accounting Office and congressional
aides are looking into the Navy's investigation.
   The Navy has 599,000 full-time personnel and some 566 ships _
and usually a third of those are at sea for training operations.
   ``Potentially, the Navy has thousands of opportunities to kill
people every day on any given carrier _ with the chance of aviation
accidents, fires, explosions or even being washed overboard,'' said
Ms. Roberts, the civilian specialist.
   ``Very rarely do we see these accidents happen,'' she said.
   Sen. John Warner of Virginia, ranking Republican on the Senate
Armed Services Committee and former Navy secretary, called the
week's events ``an extraordinary grouping of unrelated accidents.''
   The Navy released figures late Wednesday saying that since the
beginning of calendar year 1989, there have been 101 ``operation
and training related'' fatalities.
   However, included in this number are the 47 fatalities that
resulted from the explosion on baord the USS Iowa. Excluding those,
there have been 54 fatalities in calendar year 1989, the Navy said.
   According to Navy figures, the fiscal year that just ended was
the best year on record for Navy aviation, with a flight mishap
rate of 1.8 per 100,000 flight hours. A mishap is a death or major
loss of aircraft.
   According to the Pentagon's annual report on active duty
military deaths, 44 sailors fell overboard and drowned or were lost
at sea from Oct. 1, 1979, to Sept. 30, 1988. Over that same time,
201 lives were lost in aircraft lost or crashed at sea, and 224
lives were lost in aircraft accidents not at sea. There were 272
accidental drownings recorded, as well.
   In contrast, over the same nine-year period, the Navy recorded
2,225 accidental deaths from vehicle accidents, and 539 deaths
attributed to suicide, the study showed.
   The Navy did not figures available for fiscal 1989.
   Ms. Roberts said the large number of motor vehicle deaths is due
in large part to motorcycle accidents. And a good number of those
are tied to alcohol consumption during off-hours.
   ``When you're dealing with a largely teen-age population, that's
not that surprising, compared to the normal population,'' she said.

   Substantial numbers of anti-Sandinista rebels
have reinfiltrated Nicaragua from Honduras over the past month,
encountering government troops on search-and-destroy missions,
government sources said Wednesday.
   Congressional and administration sources said more than 1,000
Contra rebels have left their base camps in Honduras along
Nicaragua's northern border in recent weeks, bringing rebel troop
strength inside Nicaragua to about 4,000.
   At the same time, the rebels have asked the U.S. Agency for
International Development, which administers the current U.S.
humanitarian aid program for the Contras, for food packaged in
smaller, more easily portable quantities and for increased amounts
of cash in Nicaraguan currency, said an official familiar with the
aid program.
   AID has refused the requests, believing that to help the
reinfiltration effort would ``be a wrong signal,'' said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. An Aug. 7 accord
among the five countries in the region called for gradual
demobilization of the Contras and their return to participate in
Nicaragua's electoral process.
   ``We made a conscious decision, with concurrence at the highest
levels of this building, that we not do anything to increase ...
support of increased reinfiltration,'' said a State Department
source.
   ``It appears the process is headed away from demobilization and
back toward war,'' said Rep. George Crockett, D-Mich., chairman of
the House Foreign Affairs Western Hemisphere subcommittee.
   ``It is quite clear the Contras do not have demobilization plans
in mind. Quite conversely, they appear to have mobilization
plans,'' he said.
   Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega cited increasd Contra attacks
Wednesday as his reason for calling off a 19-month cease-fire with
the rebels.
   But some on Capitol Hill said Ortega also was responsible for
any increased skirmishing between the two sides because he
increasingly had been sending Sandinista troops into northern areas
of Nicaragua which they had traditionally not controlled.
   ``This is in part precipitated by Sandinista search-and-destroy
missions'' said Rep. Doug Bereuter, R-Neb., a member of the Foreign
Affairs and Intelligence committees. ``It's no wonder there are
conflicts.''

<HEAD>Senators Are Urged to Oust Federal Judge in Mississippi</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   House members on Wednesday urged the removal
of Judge Walter L. Nixon of Mississippi from the federal bench for
lying under oath as the Senate began floor action in its second
impeachment trial in two weeks.
   ``Judge Nixon has broken the law, tainted the federal judiciary
and brought disrepute on the courts,'' said Rep. Don Edwards,
D-Calif., in calling for removal of the judge, who was convicted of
perjury.
   If convicted by the Senate, Nixon would be the seventh federal
official ever removed through impeachment and the third judge to be
ousted from the bench in the last three years.
   Nixon took the Senate floor and declared that ``I have been
wrongfully convicted.'' He said witnesses against lied and
prosecutors held him to an unreasonably high standard of accuracy
in sworn statements.
   ``I had nothing to hide'' Nixon said. ``I had done nothing
wrong. I had not committed any corrupt act ... why would I lie
about something that I hadn't done?''
   The Senate began floor action in the case just 12 days after it
removed Alcee L. Hastings as a District Court judge in Miami on
charges of plotting to obtain a bribe and lying about it to a jury,
which acquitted him of that charge.
   Hastings was the first federal official ever removed on
impeachment charges of which he had been acquitted in a criminal
trial.
   Nixon, in contrast, last year began serving a perjury sentence
for telling the FBI and a grand jury he never discussed a marijuana
smuggling case with a local prosecutor who was an old friend.
   Drug charges against Drew Fairchild, son of a wealthy
contractor, were made inactive after Nixon discussed the case with
Forrest County District Attorney Paul Holmes, an old friend,
according to the articles of impeachment.
   Despite serving a sentence at Eglin Air Force Base in Flrida,
Nixon has continued to collect his $89,500 judicial salary and says
he will go back on the bench and preside over court cases if the
Senate acquits him.
   The House on May 10 approved, 417-0, three articles of
impeachment.
   The articles say Nixon lied by telling the grand jury Holmes
never discussed the Fairchild case with him and by saying he never
had anything to do with the case.
   The third count says that by concealing conversations with
various figures in the case after entering into a lucarative oil
and case investment with contractor Wiley Fairchild, Nixon ``raised
substantial doubt as to his judicial integrity, undermined
confidence in the integrity of the judiciary, betrayed the trust of
the people of the United States. ...''
   After hearing arguments in the case on Wednesday, the Senate
planned to debate it in closed session on Thursday and most likely
vote on Friday.
   Conviction by a two-thirds vote of senators present and voting
on any of the three articles of impeachment would mean removal of
Nixon as a judge and halt payment of his salary.
   Taking the Senate floor, Nixon told lawmakers he had always
acted fairly in his courtroom in accord with advice from ``my good
friend, former Sen. John C. Stennis.''
   Stennis, long a fixture in the congressional establishment,
retired in 1988 after representing Mississippi in the Senate for 40
years.
   ``I have served honestly and faithfully as a federal judge for
21 years,'' Nixon said. ``I have always been mindful that I was
appointed, not annointed.''
   Defense attorney David Stewart admitted that he Nixon made
errors in his testimony, but saidd they represented honest mistakes.
   ``He didn't think of it,'' Stewart said. ``He messed up. His
testimony wasn't perfect.''
   Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., another House manager of the
case, scoffed at the notion that misstatements by Nixon in his FBI
interview and grand jury testimony were merely blunders and not
lies.
   ``Are they deceits or just a series of mistakes?'' Sensenbrenner
asked the Senate in an incredulous voice. ``Fourteen mistakes?''

   East German leader Egon Krenz called public
protest at home a ``good sign'' Wednesday and said his country,
rigidly orthodox until now, would follow President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev on the path of reform.
   Krenz said he and Gorbachev reached ``total agreement on all
questions we discussed,'' one of which was reform in the Soviet
Union and East Germany.
   Many of the hundreds of thousands marching for democracy in East
Germany were showing support for ``the renovation of socialism,''
he said.
   ``In this sense, I consider this a very good sign,'' Krenz told
a news conference after meeting with Gorbachev on his first trip
abroad since replacing hard-liner Erich Honecker, his 77-year-old
mentor, two weeks ago.
   The remarks about protest were his most tolerant to date.
Krenz's government has embarked on dialogue with the opposition and
more open dealings, trying to gain the people's trust after decades
of repression.
   Honecker, who led the country for 18 years, was brought down by
the flight of tens of thousands of East Germans, most of them
skilled young workers, and weeks of mass demonstrations.
   Flight and protest continued on Wednesday.
   More than 500 East Germans showed up at the West German Embassy
in Prague, Czechoslovakia, seeking passage to the West.
   ADN, the official East German news agency, said 8,000 East
Germans had crossed the Czechoslovak border under the new policy of
visa-free travel to the neighboring Soviet bloc ally. Thousands of
East Germans already have fled to West Germany through
Czechoslovakia.
   The agency said 20,000 people marched in Neubrandenburg on
Wednesday eveningand tens of thousands filled the streets of
Frankfurt an der Oder.
   More signs of change emerged at home while Krenz was in Moscow.
   Officials in East Berlin acknowledged serious problems in the
planned economy and indicated sweeping reforms may be in store to
restructure industry and improve production. Quality consumer goods
are rare in East Germany and many people wait 10 years for a car.
   Wolfgang Vogel, a prominent government lawyer, was quoted by the
West German newspaper Die Welt as saying political prisoners were
being released and ``We hope there will be no new convictions based
on political grounds.''
   Manfred Gerlach, chairman of the Free Democratic Party and an
ally of the Communists, said the government needs overhauling, the
Cabinet should be streamlined and his party should have a greater
role.
   On a visit to West Germany, a city Communist Party chief even
questioned the Berlin Wall, the symbol of East German repression
built in 1961. Johannes Chemnitzer of Neubrandenburg said the
opening of borders by other Soviet bloc countries made the wall's
significance ``limited and illusory.''
   Krenz expressed the opposite view in Moscow, however, declaring
that the wall ``is not a border between two states ... it's a
border between two social systems, a border between two military
blocs, and this is a border in the vicinity of which are a great
concentration of weapons.''
   He told the journalists he and Gorbachev discussed Soviet
reforms, and their possible applications in East Germany, in ``an
atmosphere which exists only between true friends.''
   His government's aim, he said, is to ``further strengthen
socialism in our country and start reform in all aspects of our
society.''
   Gorbachev said on East German televisions there were
``differences and similarities'' in the reform processes of East
Germany and the Soviet Union, and each must set its own course.
   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, said Gorbachev assured
Krenz of Soviet support in the face of ``great changes'' and
expressed confidence the East German party, ``having rich
traditions, can overcome the difficulties that arise and, with the
support of the people, can lead the process of renewal.''
   Krenz would not go into detail about reforms planned in East
Germany, but denied reports that he took issue with some aspects of
Gorbachev's program, called perestroika.
   ``We wholeheartedly support the revolutionary process of
perestroika in the Soviet Union,'' he said, adding that he
especially wanted to explore its aim of giving communist more
appeal for the average citizen.
   ``If we resolve the problems of making socialism more
attractive, I'm sure people will stay in our country, '' he said.
   He promised ``to create expansive opportunities for each citizen
of East Germany to obtain a visa and passport to go to any country
in the world,'' and said proposals would be discussed by the
government, public and parliament.
   As East German leaders have before him, Krenz rejected the idea
of reunification with West Germany.
   The separate nations are ``an integral part of the stability of
Europe,'' he told the news conference, and quoted a Frenchman,
unidentified, as saying: ``I love Germany so much I'm glad there
are two of them.''

   Practitioners of shock art have danced barefoot on
glass and bitten the heads off live animals. Now one of them faces
possible arrest for lighting fireworks on his chest, again raising
the question of how much is too much.
   Shock art can appear in mild forms such as that practiced by Joe
Davis, who has shouted out his poetry while aides poured water on
his head. It can be as severe as Chris Burden's being nailed to a
Volkswagen or having someone shoot him.
   The practice of defining new art forms by shocking people set
off a national debate recently over public funding of an exhibit by
photographer Robert Mapplethope, which featured homosexual and
sadomasochistic photographs.
   ``Some art might shock and disturb people, and that's certainly
a valid thing for art to do,'' said Jeremy Alliger, executive
director at Boston's Dance Umbrella, which recently featured a
Japanese artist who danced barefoot on glass. ``He is actually
composing on the glass,'' said Alliger.
   The limit, however, is ``when people are placed without
knowledge in a position of danger themselves,'' he said. ``Whether
that can be classified as art or not, it's inappropriate.''
   Joe Coleman may have provided the acid test in Boston. Alliger
said Coleman crossed the line by endangering his audience.
   Coleman, who appeared before a small audience at the Boston Film
and Video Foundation, bit off the head and front legs of a white
mouse and hugged one spectator after he poured a bucket of blood
over himself. He also ignited fireworks on his chest and some
burning shards landed in the audience.
   ``It was definitely a terrifying experience,'' said Viveca
Gardiner, 23, a financial writer in Somerville. ``We weren't
protected and we were definitely in danger.''
   One of the smoldering pieces flew into the face of Robin Brown,
who sat near Gardiner in the audience. She said she brushed it off
her cheek, and it then landed on her skirt and burned a hole the
size of a dime.
   ``If it had landed on my eye, it definitely would have blinded
me,'' said Brown, 23, an editor for a market research firm in
Cambridge.
   Fire oficials said they would press for charges in the case.
Lighting fireworks inside is illegal, as is setting fires without a
permit or a fire detail present, Fire Chief Howard Ferguson said
Wednesday.
   ``We are trying to find out how many things we can charge them
with,'' said Ferguson, who admitted authorities had not yet
determined whom they would charge. They also can't find Coleman,
who is based in New York, Ferguson said.
   Animal rights activists, patrons and even some leaders of the
arts community say Coleman went too far.
   Gus Thornton, head of the state Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals, said ``there's a lot of concern about (use of
animals in artistic acts and movies), and I think a lot of the
industry is trying to be responsible.''
   The head of the Boston Film and Video Foundation disavowed any
connection with Coleman. Anne Marie Stein said the Coleman
performance was the independent project of a foundation member, and
the act was not funded by the public sources which support regular
foundation work.
   While she said she generally believes in letting people decide
for themselves what they think is art, the foundation would not
permit acts which could endanger the lives of people or involve
cruelty to animals.
   ``I think that goes too far,'' she said of Coleman's performance.

   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
summoned Nicaragua's ambassador on Wednesday to lodge a protest
against President Daniel Ortega's decision to resume fighting the
Contra guerrillas.
   Nicaragua's U.N. Mission called for a meeting at U.N.
headquarters next Monday and Tuesday among representatives of the
Contras, Nicaragua, Honduras, and U.N. officials involved in trying
to disband the U.S.-backed Contras.
   Its purpose would be to ``approve the logistical and technical
matters'' involved in repatriating the Contras and integrating them
in the Nicaraguan political process, the mission said.
   Perez de Cuellar called in Ambassador Alejandro Serrano Caldera
to express dismay over cancellation of the truce.
   ``The secretary-general is extremely concerned at the breakdown
of the cease-fire in Nicaragua, which had been largely holding
since early 1988,'' said his spokesman, Francois Giuliani.
   ``It is his strong wish that maximum restraint be exercised by
all parties and that the cease-fire can be renewed so that the
peace process can once again be put on track.
   ``The momentum gained by the process in recent months must not
be lost.'' The Nicaraguan Mission's statement demanded disbanding
of the Contras by Dec. 5, as called for the peace accord signed in
August by the five Central American presidents.
   It also said Nicaragua ``reaffirms once again that, regardless
of the position assumed by the mercenary forces, the electoral
process culminating with the Feb. 25 elections will be guaranteed
along with the security of international observers in their
nationwide monitoring duties.''
   Ortega's announcement that he would resume active hostilities
jarred the joint U.N.-Organization of American States efforts to
promote peaceful settlement of guerrilla wars in the region.
   Under Central American accords signed in August in Tela,
Honduras, a joint U.N.-OAS commission is trying to help the 11,000
Contras and their 12,000 dependents camped in Honduras voluntarily
disband and resettle.
   The U.S. State Department has objected to U.N. efforts to
persuade the Contras to disarm as a violation of impartiality.
   The Security Council is about ready to approve a 625-member
peacekeeping force to patrol Nicaragua's border with Honduras to
halt raids by the Contras or Sandinista troops.
   The force would also seal the Honduran border with El Salvador
so Salvadoran leftist rebels cannot receive arms shipments from
Nicaragua or Cuba.
   Civilian U.N. poll watchers are in Nicaragua to monitor the
campaign for the national elections, and have pronounced the
process fair so far.
   Recent polls show Ortega to be trailing the U.S.-backed
presidential candidate, newspaper publisher Violeta Chamorro.

<HEAD>State Presidency Refuses to Drop Charges in Kosovo Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The collective federal presidency
refused Wednesday to drop charges against Azem Vlasi, former
Communist Party chief of troubled Kosovo province, and 14 other
ethnic Albanians on trial with him.
   Police in Kosovo used tear gas to disperse about 1,000 ethnic
Albanians protesting in support of Vlasi in Pristina, the capital
and 200 more in the nearby town of Podujevo, the official news
agency Tanjug reported.
   Tanjug said the eight-member presidency _ representatives from
Yugoslavia's six republics and two provinces _ voted against the
request to drop charges.
   It did not give a breakdown of the vote, but earlier press
reports said Janez Drnovsek and Stipe Suvar, representing the
liberal republics of Slovenia and Croatia respectively, had
expressed support for stopping the trial.
   The defendants are accused of ``counterrevolutionary
activities'' for allegedly plotting Kosovo's secession from
Yugoslavia, and of inciting riots by ethnic Albanians in February.
   Serbia changed its constitution in February to give it more
control over Kosovo, an autonomous province within the republic,
prompting riots by ethnic Albanians that cost 24 lives.
   Federal police now are stationed in the southern province, an
ancient Serbian heartland that borders Albania. Serbians in Kosovo
claim they are harassed by ethnic Albanians, who make up 85 percent
of the 1.9 million people.
   The trial opened Monday in the Kosovo town of Titova Mitrovica,
but was suspended immediately by a defense demand that the
prosecutor and presiding judge be excluded on grounds of bias.
   Vlasi's lawyers also claim no court in Serbia could be
considered impartial. No date has been set for the trial to resume.

   Jessica McClure, the object of the nation's
attention for 58 hours as rescuers struggled to pull her from an
abandoned well, came to the White House Wednesday and stole not
only the scene but President Bush's glasses and handkerchief.
   ``Who's that, mama?'' the 3-year-old from Midland, Texas, asked
as Bush entered the Roosevelt Room to present the first Midland
Community Spirit Award to Sioux City, Iowa, for its response to
this summer's crash of a United Airlines jumbo jet.
   Bush, once a Midland oilman, had his glasses stolen while
holding Jessica as Midland Mayor Carroll Thomas presented the award.
   The wriggling little girl, dressed in a red corduroy smock with
Winnie the Pooh on the front, grabbed Bush's glasses off his face
and faced the clicking cameras with them balanced on her nose.
   Returning his glasses to Bush's breast pocket, Jessica
discovered the president's white handkerchief.
   ``This may make that _ what do you call it? _ the blooper of the
week,'' said the president after Jessica tried to drape the
handkerchief over his head and dabbed his nose.
   ``I'm sorry about that. You can go to your mother,'' he said,
laughing and handing the girl to her mother, 20-year-old Reba
McClure.
   After paying tribute to Sioux City as a shining example of his
``thousand points of lights'' volunteerism, Bush said, ``Thank you
all and as for you, Jessica, where's my handerkerchief?''
   As the audience howled, he asked, ``How old are you now?''
   She held up three fingers.
   Bush then said, ``C'mon, Jessica. You want to see where I work?''
   The president and the 3-year-old, with her parents trailing
behind, then headed to the Oval Office.
   Mrs. McClure said the rescue of her daughter, who was 18 months
old at the time, was similar to the rescue of passengers trapped
inside Flight 232.
   ``Everybody pulled together to save the people,'' she said.
``There were people trapped in that plane and couldn't get out _
mothers and fathers and children and they couldn't find them. And
that's exactly how I felt _ I was running through the back yard
looking for my child and I couldn't find her.''
   Mayor Thomas said the Midland Community Spirit Award would be
given annually to recognize ``the community that best exemplifies
volunteerism and compassion and concern for their fellow citizens.''
   There were 85 entries for the award, a bronze reproduction of a
plaque at Midland's civic center that shows rescuers bringing
Jessica out of the well.
   Sioux City Major Loren Callendar said the response to the crash
would not have been possible without the help of surrounding
communities in Nebraska, Iowa and South Dakota.
   ``The colleges opened their doors. ... The community as a whole
lined up a long way to provide blood. ... They did laundry. ... The
hospitals did a wonderful job. The ambulances came from all over
the small communities to transport these people,'' Callendar said.
   The United DC-10 crashed after its rear engine disintegrated in
flight, severing the plane's hydraulic systems and making it
virtually impossible to control. The crew almost landed the plane,
but it crashed on the runway, killing 112 people. An additional 184
passengers survived.

   The White House on Wednesday denounced
Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega's decision to end a truce with
the U.S.-backed Contras but brushed off talk about renewing
military aid for the rebels, saying ``we don't want to give him any
excuse'' to cancel next year's elections.

   President Bush, lashing out at Ortega, said ``the man is so out
of step with the other democratic countries in this hemisphere and
so wildly insensitive to the feelings of others that we shouldn't
have been surprised'' by his action.
   ``On the other hand, I don't think he has unleashed a full-scale
offensive at this moment,'' Bush said in a radio interview with ABC
News. ``He's hedging his bets now.''

   The administration said Bush was consulting with leaders in
Central America to bring diplomatic pressure on Ortega to reverse
course.
   ``It is obvious that he's afraid of the ballot box,'' White
House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, referring to
presidential elections set for Feb. 25 in Nicaragua.
   Congressional leaders also reacted angrily to Ortega's move, but
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said, ``I can't conceive of
the House moving now toward providing military assistance. That's
not in the direction of the peace process.''
   Costa Rican President Oscar Arias, who won the Nobel Peace Prize
in 1987 for spearheading efforts for a regional peace accord, said
in an interview on the Cable News Network, ``It's, indeed, very sad
to go back to the military fight.''
   Ortega, at a news conference in Managua, suspended the
19-month-old cease-fire with the Contras, citing continued rebels
attacks, and hinted he might cancel the elections. He accused Bush
of ``supporting terrorism in Nicaragua.''
   He added, ``Now it will depend on the Yankee Congress and the
Yankee president that these elections take place on Feb. 25.''
Later, Alejandro Bendana, secretary general of the Foreign
Ministry, said Nicaragua has no plans to cancel the elections.
   Meanwhile, administration and congressional sources said that
between 1,000 to 1,500 anti-Sandinista rebels have returned to
Nicaragua from base camps in Honduras over the past month, bringing
the guerrillas troop strength to about 4,000.
   Under a Central American peace plan, the rebels are supposed to
be disarmed and demobilized by Dec. 5. Sources said many Contras
decided to return to Nicaragua because it would be far easier for
them to escape demobilization if they were wandering undetected
inside Nicaraguan territory.
   Contra leaders have told U.S. officials they plan to continue
abiding by the cease-fire despite Ortega's decision to end the
truce, officials said.
   Responding quickly to Ortega, Fitzwater said his announcement
``underscores the Sandinista regime's lack of commitment to the
peace process and democratization in Nicaragua. His deplorable
action ... is an affront to the hemisphere and the democratic
traditions we hold so important.''
   Asked about prospects for renewing military aid for the rebels,
which would require approval by Congress, Fitzwater said, ``We
don't want to go that route. We want to get free elections.''
   Fitzwater added concerning Ortega, ``We certainly don't want to
give him any excuse'' to cancel the elections.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the United
States wants the Contras, too, to honor the cease-fire and will cut
off U.S. humanitarian assistance to rebel forces that engage in
offensive operations.
   However, he said Ortega's Sandinista army ``has violated the
cease-fire from the day it was imposed. It has conducted regular
offensive sweeps against the resistance, resulting in over 100
killed in the last five months.''
   Boucher added, ``In recent days, we've seen the
Sandinista-sponsored thugs attack peaceful political rallies by the
Democratic opposition.''
   A senior administration official said that while the United
States wants the Contras to continue honoring the truce,
``Obviously you cannot tell people not to defend themselves. We are
hoping the Sandinistas will reconsider.''
   The official, insisting on anonymity, said Ortega might not
resume the fighting.
   ``He may have felt he boxed himself in publicly and didn't know
how to walk away from it. The question is not what they say but
what they do,'' the official added.
   Acknowledging that the Contras have been involved in military
action, Fitzwater said, ``there have been skirmishes and killing on
both sides but in no case has there been any action to justify his
(Ortega's) abandoning the peace process or the election process.''
   Reversing the course followed for eight years by the Reagan
administration, Bush set a strategy of seeking a diplomatic
solution rather than a military victory in Nicaragua. He was pushed
in that direction by Congress, which had not approved any military
funding for the Contras since October 1986.
   In a compromise with the White House, Congress earlier this year
approved $49 million in non-lethal aid for the Contras.

   Snow pestered motorists in portions of Colorado, North Dakota
and Wyoming, and rain drenched the nation's northeast, but
temperatures rose into the 70s in Texas and much of the lower
Mississippi Valley on Wednesday.
   Up to 5 inches of snow greeted morning commuters in the Denver
area, with as much as 6 inches in Fort Collins, Colo., and 8 inches
in the northern mountains.
   Traffic was bumper to bumper along icy Colorado roads, with
numerous minor traffic accidents reported and a multi-car pileup
south of Denver. No serious injuries were reported.
   ``This is the storm that separates those prepared from those not
prepared,'' said Denver public works spokeswoman Amy Lingg.
   Denver skies cleared by afternoon. Snow also fell in
southeastern Colorado and parts of Minnesota, North Dakota and
Wyoming.
   Elsewhere, showers produced about 1.5 inches of rain in Islip,
N.Y., in a six-hour period ending at 7 a.m. EST. Providence, R.I.,
got slightly less, with showers also plaguing parts of Maine and
Massachusetts.
   Temperatures dipped into the teens in the northern Rockies and
the northern High Plains regions, with single-digit readings in
Wyoming and Montana.
   Butte and Cutbank in Montana tied as the morning cold spots in
the Lower 48 states, with lows of 2 degrees.
   The leading edge of a cold arctic air mass pushed across eastern
Oklahoma and central Texas.
   Strong northerly winds prevailed across the central and southern
high Plains. Temperatures were in the 20s and 30s in the northern
Plains and in the 60s and 70s in southern and eastern Texas and
across much of the lower Mississippi Valley. Highs rose to the 80s
across Florida.

<TEXT>
   Iran on Wednesday approved a law giving
it the power to arrest Americans anywhere and put them on trial,
and one newspaper suggested that the first target be the former
commander of the USS Vincennes.
   The action came amid growing anti-U.S. passion being whipped up
to mark the 10th anniversary of the storming of the U.S. Embassy in
Tehran. Protesters plan to burn 160 American flags outside the
compound _ now a school _ on Saturday.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said the Majlis, or
parliament, unanimously approved a final version of the bill that
earlier had been passed by the 12-member Council of Guardians, a
constitutional watchdog body. The council acted after the 270-seat
Majlis approved a first draft of the measure on Tuesday.
   The law will remain on the books ``as long as the U.S. president
is authorized to commit inhuman practices against the lives and
interests of Iranian citizens,'' the agency reported in a dispatch
monitored in Cyprus.
   The Iranian move was in response to the Justice Department's
authorization of the FBI to arrest suspected terrorists abroad and
bring them to trial in the United States without the permission of
the countries where they were located.
   The U.S. move did not specify Iran. But it is one of several
nations accused of supporting and encouraging terrorism, including
the kidnapping of Americans and other Westerners in Lebanon,
assassinations and hijackings.
   Iranian radicals clearly saw the Justice Department's action as
aimed at the Islamic republic.
   ``You who scream about human rights and talk about terrorism,
are yourselves innately terrorists and criminals who have taken
security away from the people of the world,'' said Parliament
Speaker Mehdi Karrubi, a leading radical.
   Several Iranian-backed Shiite militants in Lebanon are wanted by
the United States for hijacking a TWA airliner in 1985 and killing
a U.S. Navy diver aboard the jet.
   In 1987, FBI agents lured a Lebanese Shiite, Fawaz Younis,
wanted for the 1985 Beirut hijacking of a Jordanian airliner
carrying U.S. citizens, to a yacht in international waters off the
Mediterranean island of Cyprus and arrested him.
   A U.S. court recently sentenced him to 30 years in prison.
   The new Iranian law allows the Tehran government to arrest
Americans deemed to have acted against Iranian interests anywhere
in the world and bring them to the Islamic Republic for trial by
no-jury Islamic courts.
   ``U.S. citizens and their agents, and countries which
collaborate with the United States in kidnapping or endangering
Iranian citizens or the interests of the Islamic republic, will be
tried by Iranian courts according to Islamic justice,'' the bill
declared.
   ``We have to empower the president and officials of the Islamic
republic to take reprisal measures'' to protect Iranians, Karrubi
said.
   Tehran's radical daily Abrar said Capt. Will Rogers III,
commander of the missile cruiser Vincennes when it mistakenly shot
down an Iranian airliner last year, should be the first person
brought to trial under the new law.
   The Vincennes shot down the jetliner during fighting in the
Persian Gulf in July 1988, killing all 290 people on board. The
Navy said the crew mistook the plane for an attacking Iranian F-14
fighter jet.
   Iranian radicals have been stirring anti-American passions
around Saturday's anniversary of the Nov. 4, 1979, embassy seizure.
   Militant Iranian students backed by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days, helping to consolidate the
anti-Western Islamic revolution.
   As part of the celebrations, protesters will burn 160 American
flags outside the embassy compound, now a school for Iran's
Revolutionary Guards Corps, in downtown Tehran, to commemorate 16
Shiites executed in September by Saudi Arabia for bombings in the
holy city of Mecca.
   Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who succeeded Khomeini when the
revolutionary leader died June 3, vowed to ``confront all aspects
of global arrogance throughout the world.''
   ``Global arrogance'' is a favorite Iranian name for the United
States.
   Khamenei called the takeover of the embassy a ``historic event.''
   ``With the capture of the American nest of spies ... the
gigantic empire of cruelty and oppression in the contemporary world
was at once overcome, and the dust of this humiliation will forever
remain on the faces of the arrogant leaders of America,'' Tehran
radio quoted him as saying.

   Text of official translation of the
Sandinista government communique released Wednesday:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The government of Nicaragua, which has been so intensely
committed to the cause of peace, cannot but condemn before the
national and international public opinion the infiltration of
mercenary forces into the fifth and sixth region from their bases
in Honduras over the last 20 days.
   Over the past three weeks, more than 1,100 mercenaries have
penetrated our national territory, taking advantage of the
Nicaraguan government's unilaterally declared cease-fire and
utilizing the so called ``humanitarian aid'' approved by the U.S.
Congress in order to carry out their criminal activities.
   As the result of these infiltrations there has been a dramatic
escalation over the last few weeks of attacks against civilian,
economic and military targets with the ensuing loss of civilian
life among the Nicaraguan population.
   These actions, are meant both to sabotage the Tela Central
American Presidential Agreement of Aug. 7, 1989 to demobilize the
mercenary forces and also to put obstacles in the path of the
electoral process.
   In the face of these facts,
   1. At this time, the government of Nicaragua is carrying out
emergency efforts with different governments, political
personalities, institutions and international organisms with the
aim of strengthening the peace process currently upset by the
stepped-up aggressive behavior of the counterrevolutionary bands.
   2. The government of Nicaragua exhorts the United States
government to support this international peace effort and
contribute to the positive unfolding of the electoral process that
is to culminate with elections on Feb. 25, 1990.
   3. So as to strengthen the diverse steps which the International
Verification and Support Commission (CIAV) has taken in order to
carry out the Tela accords, the Nicaraguan government is convening
a meeting at U.N. headquarters on Nov. 6 and 7 among the
governments of Nicaragua and Honduras, the CIAV and a
representation of the counterrevolutionaries. The objective is to
approve the logistical and technical matters that can promote
repatriation and the integration into the political process of all
those persons linked to counterrevolutionary activities or their
resettlement in third countries, as stipulated in the Tela accords.
   4. The Nicaraguan government hopes that the international
initiative will immediately achieve the end of the bloodshed
provoked by the counterrevolutionary activities thereby
facilitating the carrying out of the Contra demobilization accord
by Dec. 5.
   5. The government of Nicaragua reaffirms once again that,
regardless of the position assumed by the mercenary forces, the
electoral process culminating with the Feb. 25 elections will be
guaranteed along with the security of the international observers
in their nationwide monitoring duties.
   6. To the extent that the initiatives listed above begin showing
concrete results in the areas of contra demobilization, an end to
the infiltration of armed mercenaries into Nicaragua territory and
of their terrorist activities, the government of Nicaragua will
then be in a position to once more re-establish the unilateral
cease fire as it had been doing since March 1988.

   Following are excerpts from President Daniel Ortega's news
conference after his annoucement that the truce would not be
renewed:
   Q. Why this sudden and unexpected change and what is your
message to the American Congress?
   Ortega: North American congressmen, with all the respect due
some of them, are electioneering. ... They tell me: I don't agree
with this, but I have to think of my voters, and if my voters have
other viewpoints then I have to express myself as my voters think
and not how I think. ...
   ... When we announce that we are not going to renew the
cease-fire, the Yankee Congress hits the roof because it knows that
since they are meddling in Nicaragua's politics they will have to
take up again the subject of Nicaragua and they don't want to take
up the subject of Nicaragua. ...
   ... There will even be a hot-headed congressman who will arrive
and propose military aid (for the Contras). ... That's a problem of
Congress if they want to discuss military aid.
   We simply point out that according to how the Yankee Congress
acts, it will facilitate that we carry out the elections or it's
going to hinder the electoral process.
   Now it will depend on the Yankee Congress, the Yankee president
whether these elections take place or not on Feb. 25. ...
   ... We have the will to do it, but it will depend on them
whether or not these elections will take place Feb. 25.
   Q: Has the government of Nicaragua thought of what quantity,
what numbers we're talking about, if 20 percent, 10 percent, 50
percent of the Contras would have to demobilize in order to renew
the cease-fire?
   Ortega: The important thing is that the plan start to be
implemented. The number of Contras that would begin to be
demobilized, that would be according to what will be discussed at
the United Nations. In other words, how many Contras can be
demobilized immediately, how many to Nicaragua, how many to third
countries, then ... according to how that develops, then we would
be in the disposition to re-establish the cease-fire.
   Q: President, are you taking steps with the Latin American
governments? Could you tell us something about the communications
that you have had with these (nations) about the demobilization of
the Contras, the efforts that they can make?
   Ortega: Well, until now the communications I've had have been
with President Carlos Andres Perez (of Venezuela) when I was in
Costa Rica on Saturday (Oct.) the 28th ...
   He committed himself to the international arrangements with
President (Oscar) Arias (of Costa Rica).
   Also with President (Carlos) Menem (of Argentina), who was here
in Nicaragua. Then last night I read a (wire service) dispatch that
brings the information that President (Vinicio) Cerezo (of
Guatemala) is willing to mediate in this conflict between the
United States and Nicaragua.
   Because it's clear this is a conflict between the United States
and Nicaragua, it's not an internal conflict here in Nicaragua ...
   And the communication I had with (the Rev. Jesse) Jackson.
   So far this is the action on the international arena.

   A 39-year-old paroled killer was convicted
Wednesday of shooting a young woman to death in a street holdup a
week after she moved to New York from Arkansas to study art.
   The state Supreme Court jury in Brooklyn deliberated less than
four hours before finding the defendant, Frank DeChirico of
Brooklyn, guilty of murder, robbery and criminal weapons possession.
   Judith Anne Wrappe, 24, of Little Rock, Ark., was returning to
her dormitory room at the Pratt Institute on Sept. 14, 1988, when
she was shot in the chest as she struggled to hang on to her purse,
which police said contained $27.
   She had moved to Brooklyn to study art at the institute only a
week before and had been working as a part-time waitress in
Manhattan.
   ``I'm glad it's over,'' Sue Wrape, the victim's mother said from
her home in Little Rock. ``We had confidence in the system.''
   DeChirico faces 25 years-to-life in prison when he's sentenced
Nov. 27 by Justice Philip E. Lagana.
   The defense lawyer, Louis R. Rosenthal, said he would appeal the
verdict.
   Assistant District Attorney Andrew Dember said only that
``justice was done'' before hurrying out of the courthouse.
   DeChirico served 13 years in an upstate prison for manslaughter
for killing an acquaintance during a dispute in 1973. He was free
on parole when he killed Ms. Wrappe.

   House members on Wednesday urged the removal
of Judge Walter L. Nixon of Mississippi from the federal bench for
lying under oath as the Senate began floor action in its second
impeachment trial in two weeks.
   ``Judge Nixon has broken the law, tainted the federal judiciary
and brought disrepute on the courts,'' said Rep. Don Edwards,
D-Calif., in calling for removal of the judge, who was convicted of
perjury.
   If convicted by the Senate, Nixon would be the seventh federal
official ever removed through impeachment and the third judge to be
ousted from the bench in the last three years.
   Nixon took the Senate floor and declared that ``I have been
wrongfully convicted.'' He said witnesses against lied and
prosecutors held him to an unreasonably high standard of accuracy
in sworn statements.
   ``I had nothing to hide'' Nixon said. ``I had done nothing
wrong. I had not committed any corrupt act ... why would I lie
about something that I hadn't done?''
   The Senate began floor action in the case just 12 days after it
removed Alcee L. Hastings as a District Court judge in Miami on
charges of plotting to obtain a bribe and lying about it to a jury,
which acquitted him of that charge.
   Hastings was the first federal official ever removed on
impeachment charges of which he had been acquitted in a criminal
trial.
   Nixon, in contrast, last year began serving a perjury sentence
for telling a grand jury he never discussed a marijuana smuggling
case with a local prosecutor who was an old friend.
   Drug charges against Drew Fairchild, son of a wealthy
contractor, were made inactive after Nixon discussed the case with
Forrest County District Attorney Paul Holmes, an old friend,
according to the articles of impeachment.
   Despite serving a sentence at Eglin Air Force Base in Flrida,
Nixon has continued to collect his $89,500 judicial salary and says
he will go back on the bench and preside over court cases if the
Senate acquits him.
   The House on May 10 approved, 417-0, three articles of
impeachment.
   The articles say Nixon lied by telling the grand jury Holmes
never discussed the Fairchild case with him and by saying he never
had anything to do with the case.
   The third count says that by concealing conversations with
various figures in the case after entering into a lucarative oil
and case investment with contractor Wiley Fairchild, Nixon ``raised
substantial doubt as to his judicial integrity, undermined
confidence in the integrity of the judiciary, betrayed the trust of
the people of the United States. ...''
   After hearing arguments in the case on Wednesday, the Senate
planned to debate it in closed session on Thursday and most likely
vote on Friday.
   Conviction by a two-thirds vote of senators present and voting
on any of the three articles of impeachment would mean removal of
Nixon as a judge and halt payment of his salary.
   Taking the Senate floor, Nixon told lawmakers he had always
acted fairly in his courtroom in accord with advice from ``my good
friend, former Sen. John C. Stennis.''
   Stennis, long a fixture in the congressional establishment,
retired in 1988 after representing Mississippi in the Senate for 40
years.
   ``I have served honestly and faithfully as a federal judge for
21 years,'' Nixon said. ``I have always been mindful that I was
appointed, not annointed.''
   Defense attorney David Stewart admitted that he Nixon made
errors in his testimony, but saidd they represented honest mistakes.
   ``He didn't think of it,'' Stewart said. ``He messed up. His
testimony wasn't perfect.''
   Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., another House manager of the
case, scoffed at the notion that misstatements by Nixon in his FBI
interview and grand jury testimony were merely blunders and not
lies.
   ``Are they deceits or just a series of mistakes?'' Sensenbrenner
asked the Senate in an incredulous voice. ``Fourteen mistakes?''

   A major earthquake rocked northeastern Japan early
Thursday and more than 6,000 coastal residents were evacuated as a
precaution against seismic-caused tidal waves, officials reported.
   No casualties or major damage were reported, and the evacuation
order was lifted after 3{ hours as the danger of such waves, called
tsunami, subsided.
   The quake, centered 18 miles below the seabed and about 80 miles
off Japan's main Honshu island, struck at 3:26 a.m. (1:26 p.m.
Wednesday EST) with a magnitude estimated here at 7.1 on the
Richter scale. That was the same magnitude as the Oct. 17 quake
that devastated the San Francisco Bay area.
   The U.S. Geological Survey in Colorado reckoned the magnitude at
7.3.
   Toshihara Kon, a fire department official in Iwate prefecture,
about 300 miles northeast of Tokyo, said 6,165 people from six
coastal towns and villages were evacuated to town halls and school
gymnasiums after the quake.
   Kon said the evacuation order was lifted at 7 a.m. All tsunami
warnings were lifted by 7:40 a.m., the Central Meteorological
Agency said, but it cautioned about slight rises in sea level.
   After the quake, officials closed the main expressway through
the affected region for inspection and overnight trains were
stopped to check the condition of the rails.
   A small landslide briefly blocked traffic on a local road, but
dirt and rocks were cleared away and traffic returned to normal at
6 a.m., he said.
   About 400 boats, mostly fishing craft, put out to sea from
Hachinohe to avoid being caught in the harbor by tsunami. They
later returned.
   Toshio Akiyama, head of the meteorological agency's earthquake
and tsunami observation division, said the quake's impact was
blunted by its distance from shore.
   Akiyama said authorities remained cautious because a series of
quakes had occurred in the area in recent months.
   On Sunday, a quake centered about 95 miles off the coast and
registering 6.5 on the Richter scale hit the area, but no
casualties or damage were reported.
   Akiyama said another quake, measuring with a magnitude of 5.7
struck at 4:57 a.m. in Tottori prefecture, about 300 miles
southwest of Tokyo. He said there were no casualties or damage and
the Thursday quakes were not related.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. A quake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage in
populated areas, and a quake of 7 is capable of widespread, heavy
damage.
   Like California, Japan sits atop a major fault and is frequently
shaken by earthquakes, although few cause casualties.
   In Washington, Don Finley, a spokesman for the U.S. Geological
Survey, said the main earthquake off Honshu was the strongest in
the region since a 7.7 earthquake struck March 9, 1931.

   Leftist rebels fired two
anti-tank weapons Wednesday at the headquarters of the 1st Army
Brigade, killing one civilian and wounding another in the latest in
an escalating cycle of violence.
   The attack came one day after the bombing of a labor
federation's headquarters in which 10 people were killed and 29
wounded.
   Guerrillas aboard a red pickup truck stopped two blocks from the
entrance of the army headquarters in the city's northern sector,
witnesses and soldiers said. The rebels fired two anti-tank
weapons, both of which struck a car that pulled out from a side
street into the line of fire.
   The car's driver, identified by rescue workers as Hermogenes
Martinez, was mortally wounded by the rockets, which demolished his
car. A spokeswoman at the downtown Rosales Hospital said Martinez,
59, died in the emergency room.
   A street vendor was wounded in the attack, the rescue workers
reported.
   On Tuesday, terrorists bombed the leftist National Federation of
Salvadoran Workers hall in downtown San Salvador.
   A strike call by the workers federation, popularly known as
Fenastras, remained largely unheeded Wednesday, with public
transportation running normally, and plants, banks and shops doing
business as usual.
   Farabundo Marti National Front guerrillas blamed the rightist
government of President Alfredo Cristiani for Tuesday's bombing and
vowed to avenge the slain unionists. No one claimed responsibility.
   ``The moment for combat has arrived. The moment for setting fire
to the fascists has arrived,'' the guerrillas said in a broadcast
on their clandestine Radio Venceremos.
   Leftist leaders often refer to members of the governing
Republican Nationalist Alliance party as ``fascists.''
   ``The fascists are mistaken if they think they can terrorize the
people like this. The times when the people would run and hide are
past. ... If it is war they want, then war they will get as the
answer to these crimes,'' the broadcast said.
   The violence has threatened future talks between the guerrillas
and Cristiani's government to end the decade-long civil war.
   Four people were wounded, including an American citizen, when
another bomb went off earlier Tuesday at the office of an
organization of relatives of missing persons and political
prisoners.
   Leftist organizations blamed the military for the attacks
Tuesday, saying they were in retaliation for a guerrilla mortar
attack on the Defense Ministry compound Monday that killed one
civilian and wounded 15 others.
   Military spokesmen rejected the leftists' accusation and
promised to investigate and punish those responsible.
   The guerrilla broadcast further warned the attacks, ``committed
by the high command,'' endanger a third meeting with government
representatives, scheduled for Nov. 20 in Caracas, Venezuela, to
try negotiate a cease-fire in the war that has killed more than
70,000 people.
   ``From now on all workers are at war with (Defense Minister)
Gen. Humberto Larios, the high command and the ARENA government,''
the National Union of Salvadoran Workers, the largest labor
federation, said in a communique.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher
condemned the bombings but declined to assess blame for them. He
criticized extremists of both the left and the right for the
continuing violence.
   ``The extreme left and right in El Salvador bring neither
liberation nor order, they bring suffering, terror and death,'' he
said. ``We condemn these acts of violence.''

   From spray-painted swastikas to physical
violence, incidents of bigotry are increasing on college campuses
and universities face a moral obligation to confront them, school
officials said Wednesday.
   ``It's a question of morality, and colleges and universities are
unwilling to speak about morality too frequently,'' Richard
Breslin, president of Drexel University, told delegates to a
special conference of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith,
the Jewish service organization.
   ``We need to have a willingness to confront things,'' he said.
   The incidents range from swastikas painted on campus bulletin
boards to violence against members of minority groups, the ADL
said, and they are increasing.
   The ADL's annual audit of anti-Semitic incidents on college
campuses showed a sharp rise from six cases in 1984 to 38 last
year. The group counted 12 in 1985, 19 in 1986 and only 14 in 1987.
Figures for 1989 won't be available until January, a spokesman said.
   The National Institute Against Prejudice and Violence said
incidents motivated by prejudice occurred on 174 college campuses
from September 1986 to December 1988.
   The ADL listed a few of the cases from the past two years.
   _Last month, two Jewish students leaving a party at the Hillel
House at Brooklyn College were severely beaten by a group of youths
shouting anti-Jewish slurs.
   _A group of youths marched on the Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity
house at the University of Illinois campus in Champaign-Urbana last
month, shouting anti-Semitic slogans. Students inside called police
for help.
   _Campus sidewalks at the University of Delaware were defaced
with slogans such as ``Stay in the closet, fag'' in October 1988.
   _An American Indian student serving as the Macalester College's
community council president in St. Paul, Minn., received hate mail
during the fall of 1988, including a letter that read in part,
``Custer should have finished off your entire degenerate race.''
   _Lesbian students in a dorm lounge at Boston University were
accosted by a man who threw one against a glass wall and threatened
to kill another student who tried to intervene.
   _The first black fraternity house on the campus of the
University of Mississippi was burned down in August 1988 before the
members moved in. Arson was suspected.
   _The Hillel Foundation building at Rutgers University was
defaced with swastikas and anti-Semitic slogans such as ``Die Jew''
in January 1988 and August of this year.
   ADL Director Abraham H. Foxman said his group has been unable to
determine why bigotry has increased.
   ``If we knew why, we could have done something to prevent it,''
he said. ``The fact that it is happening is serious enough to focus
as much attention on it.
   ``One way of dealing with it is exposing it. We're dealing with
prejudice _ it's a disease, an illness. We can't afford to sit
back, we have to do everything we can to limit its virulence.''
   Some of the university administrators at the conference
suggested ``codes of conduct'' against bigotry, but Foxman was
uncertain of their effectiveness.
   ``I would rather see a stigma attached to acts of bigotry on a
college campus than to have to `legislate' against them. But that
depends on whether or not college officials speak out quickly,
clearly and unequivocally,'' he said.
   Temple University President Peter J. Liacouras, keynote speaker
for the conference, called on universities to go beyond condemning
bias to eliminating it from their policies for hiring and student
admissions.
   ``Young people on campuses will look at our message to them and
at our actions,'' said Liacouras.
   About 200 college administrators and other delegates attended
the conference, which was held in conjunction with the ADL's
four-day executive committee meeting in Philadelphia.
   The ADL sponsored similar conferences in May at Augsburg College
in Minneapolis and in January 1988 at Wellsley College in Wellsley,
Mass. It plans similar gatherings early next year at Ohio State and
George Washington universities.

<DATELINE>DEADWOOD, S.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gunslingers dressed as Wild Bill Hickok
and Calamity Jane fired pistols into the air at high noon Wednesday
to signal the start of legal gambling in the town where Hickok was
slain while playing cards.
   It didn't take Evelyn Klocko of Central City long to cash in.
With the echo of gunfire barely gone from Main Street, she stuck
six quarters in a slot machine, pulled the handle and won a
whopping $30.
   ``It doesn't take any brains to pull the handle,'' she said as
she counted her winnings.
   Police Chief Les Bradley said he heard that one slot-machine
patron won $3,300.
   Main Street was packed despite 8 inches of snow that fell
overnight and temperatures just above freezing. Bradley said he
believed 3,000 to 4,000 people came to this landmark, Black Hills
town of about 2,000 to play one-armed bandits, poker and blackjack.
   Deadwood didn't get into gambling just for fun. Half an 8
percent tax on gaming profits go to restore some of the town's
buildings, and supporters hope gambling will bring more tourists.
   Gambling also marks a return to Deadwood's colorful past a
century after gold miners rushed here hoping to get rich. There was
gambling, prostitution and shootouts. In 1876, Hickok was shot in
the back while holding aces and eights in Deadwood's Saloon No. 10.
   Calamity Jane, who dressed in men's clothes and boasted of her
exploits as a pony-express rider and army scout, was one of the
first women to arrive after gold was found in the late 1800s. The
woman playing her Wednesday was supposed to be the first to shoot
her pistol into the air outside the Franklin Hotel.
   But her Colt .45-caliber revolver misfired, leaving the job of
starting the games to the man portraying Hickock.
   A few minutes later, the two fired their guns again, this time
simultaneously.
   People waiting their turn to play slot machines or just watch
the action packed the hotel and two saloons.
   At Durty Nelly's Bar, smoke filled the air and waitresses
scurried around serving drinks. At one poker table, a group of
savvy card players told the dealer what to do.
   The town doesn't have any big casinos like Las Vegas or Atlantic
City, N.J., said Bill Walsh, owner of the Franklin and Durty
Nelly's.
   ``This gaming is going to be run by families,'' Walsh said.
``It's sort of a ma-and-pop operation, and it's very personable and
less intimidating.
   ``There's not going to be any glitz and no bright lights.''
   The limit on card games is $5 per raise; the slot machines take
nickels, quarters and dollars.
   Some last-minute touches were still being made as the games
begun. Workers labored around the clock Tuesday night at gambling
parlors, installing slot machines, build card tables and doing
other jobs.
   State Gaming Commission officials made final inspections during
the evening and Wednesday morning, putting blue stickers on
gambling devices cleared for play.
   Lawrence County State's Attorney Jeff Bloomberg said there had
been no evidence that organized crime has tried to muscle in on
Deadwood gambling. But Bloomberg said he expected card sharks and
slot-machine thieves will view the town as a training ground for
more lucrative exploits in Nevada and Atlantic City.
   ``We're going to do our utmost to put a stop to that type of
activity,'' he said. ``When people come to Deadwood, we want them
to know that the games they participate in are ones of integrity,
and they don't have to worry about getting cheated.''
   Saloons and restaurants have been licensed for gambling, and so
have candy stores, dry cleaners and other businesses.
   At the exit of a local Safeway supermarket, slot machines await
departing customers.
   ``That's where all the change will go from the checkout
counter,'' one man remarked on his way out.

   A Contra military commander said
Wednesday that after 21 months without U.S. military aid, his
rebels will defend themselves as best they can from attacks by
Nicaragua's Sandinista army, but ``we won't respond to Sandinista
fire because we can't.''
   The commander, Enrique Bermudez, asked the United States to
resume military aid. A communique from his general staff said
Sandinista soldiers backed by Soviet-made helicopter gunships
attacked two rebel positions in Zelaya province Wednesday.
   The communique gave no details or casualties.
   President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua said Wednesday he was
ending a 19-month truce because of increased Contra attacks,
including one last week that killed 18 people and another Monday
that killed four.
   Bermudez called Ortega's allegation ``a lie'' and said the
Sandinistas had political motives.
   He said the Sandinista army began large-scale mobilizations in
three provinces on Tuesday, the day before Ortega's announcement.
   ``The Sandinistas are looking for excuses not to have elections,
to impose a state of siege in Nicaragua and to impede citizens from
exercising their suffrage in the Feb. 25, 1990, elections,'' he
said in an interview with The Associated Press.
   Bermudez said Ortega left the United State with one choice:
renewing the military aid that ended in February 1988. He said
Congress ``should not leave us defenseless.''
   ``We know that the reigning political reality in the United
States does not favor sending a lot of arms to our fighters, but
this is the only option,'' Bermudez said.
   About 12,000 rebel fighters retreated to base camps in Honduras
last year after seven years of military aid ended and the
cease-fire began.
   Bermudez said 6,000 Contras have returned to Nicaragua since the
five Central American presidents agreed on Aug. 7 that the Contras
would be disbanded and relocated in exchange for moves toward
democratization in Nicaragua.
   Congressional and administration sources in Washington put the
rebel troop strength inside Nicaragua at about 4,000.
   ``These troops will only carry out evasive actions in the face
of a Sandinista army that has received $1 billion worth of arms
from the Soviet Union in the last few years,'' Bermudez said.
   ``It is a pity that our troops haven't received even a single
cartridge from the United States in almost two years. Faced with
this reality, we can't do anything except save our own lives and
defend ourselves as best we can.''
   In Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, former Contra leader
Alfredo Cesar accused the Sandinistas of ``preferring war to the
political process,'' which might hand it an electoral defeat.
   Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo of Managua called on the Contras,
the Sandinistas and the superpowers to demonstrate ``maturity'' and
avoid a ``bloodbath.''
   President Jose Azcona of Honduras said in a statement that
Ortega's decision jeopardizes the agreement to disband the Contras
based in Honduras.
   Costa Rica's president, Oscar Arias, condemned the move, saying
it endangers the peace process that was begun in Nicaragua.
   The San Jose newspaper Prensa Libre said Arias and Foreign
Minister Rodrigo Madrigal tried to talk Ortega out of calling off
the cease-fire.

   Gunmen assassinated a Saudi Arabian
foreign service employee Wednesday and a pro-Iranian group that
holds at least two American hostages claimed responsibility.
   Islamic Jihad said it killed Mohammed Ali Marzouqi, personnel
officer at the Saudi Embassy in Damascus, Syria, to avenge the
beheading of 16 convicted terrorists in Saudi Arabia on Sept. 21.
   A typed statement in Arabic was delivered to a Western news
agency, accompanied by a picture of American hostage Terry
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press,
to prove its authenticity.
   The Revolutionary Justice Organization, a Shiite group that
holds two other U.S. hostages, vowed to kill 10 Americans for any
``revolutionary'' threatened by a recent U.S. Justice Department
ruling allowing American authorities to pursue and apprehend
terrorists abroad.
   Police said Marzouqi, 68, was climbing into his gray embassy
limousine in west Beirut's Tallet Khayyat district when three men
raked his car with fire from submachine guns equipped with
silencers. They said his Syrian driver was wounded in the right
hand.
   Marzouqi was a frequent visitor to Beirut. He handled paychecks
for Lebanese employees who act as custodians of the deserted
embassy.
   Saudi diplomats and personnel were evacuated in 1985, after
pro-Iranian Shiite zealots ransacked the embassy.
   Iran and Saudi Arabia, which is predominantly Sunni Moslem, are
at odds over who speaks for the world's nearly 1 billion Moslems.
Saudi Arabia broke relations with Iran in April 1988, accusing it
of subversion and terrorism.
   Islamic Jihad said in the statement Wednesday: ``Several weeks
ago the rulers of Saudi Arabia, the servants of the devil,
committed a massacre against 16 Moslem pilgrims from Kuwait.
   ``They thought they had escaped (the consequences of) their act
... but we will kill them wherever we find them.''
   It claimed Marzouqi was ``one of the most senior Saudi security
officers in Lebanon. His activities were not hidden from the eyes
of our Mujahedeen,'' or holy warriors.
   Revolutionary Justice did not mention Marzouqi. Its threat to
Americans was made in a handwritten statement in Arabic delivered
to the independent Beirut newspaper An-Nahar with a photocopy of an
old picture of American hostage Edward Austin Tracy, who was
kidnapped Oct. 21, 1986.
   It was reacting to a Justice Department decision empowering FBI
agents to arrest terrorists abroad, and a draft law before the
Congress making terrorist attacks against Americans punishable by
death.
   Iran's parliament approved a law Wednesday authorizing the
arrest anywhere in the world of Americans who acted against Iran.
   In its statement, Revolutionary Justice said it would ``kill 10
Americans for threatening the freedom or life of a single
revolutionary.''
   Saudis have been a target of worldwide terrorism in recent
months, and pro-Iranian factions have claimed responsibility in
statements from Beirut.
   On Oct. 16, an embassy employee in Ankara, Turkey, lost both
legs in a car bomb explosion.
   A Saudi serving as a Moslem prayer leader in was killed in
March, and an Egyptian driver for the Saudi Embassy there was
murdered in June. The third secretary at the Saudi Embassy in
Thailand was killed in Bangkok in January.
   The picture of Anderson accompanying the Islamic Jihad statement
showed him with a mustache, cutting a birthday cake, wearing a pale
T-shirt and glasses.
   Anderson was kidnapped March 16, 1985, and has been held longest
of the 18 hostages in Lebanon. He was 42 on Oct. 27.
   It was unclear whether the picture was new, or one of a series
of similar pictures released in the past year. The cake in front of
him looked different and appeared to have a single tier, rather
than two as in the previous photos.
   Islamic Jihad also holds Thomas Sutherland, 58, who was acting
dean of agriculture at American University of Beirut when he was
kidnapped June 9, 1985.
   Revolutionary Justice holds Tracy and Joseph James Cicippio, 59,
of Valley Forge, Pa., kidnapped Sept. 12, 1986. Its statement did
not include a direct threat to them.

<HEAD>Shining Path Rebels Attack Police Near Downtown Lima, 2 Killed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   At least 100 Maoist rebels fired guns and
explosives Wednesday at police supervising a religious procession
near downtown Lima, officials said. Two rebels were killed and 15
people were wounded, officials said.
   Police said they detained 140 people after the attack.
   Bomb squad units were called to the scene to deactivate
explosive devices left by the rebels, said an AP photographer at
the scene.
   Interior Minister Agustin Mantilla told reporters the rebels had
staged a brief march in the working-class district of La Victoria
at the same time as the procession to mark All Saints Day.
   The guerrillas attacked the police, but other police from a
nearby precinct arrived and joined in the battle.
   Mantilla said two rebels were killed and 14 were wounded. He
said a police sergeant was wounded by shrapnel from a homemade bomb
thrown by the rebels.
   Reporters said the rebels carried banners and scattered
pamphlets urging people to stay home Friday and to boycott
municipal elections scheduled for Nov. 12.
   The Shining Path announced an ``armed strike'' last week as part
of its campaign to sabotage the elections. The term is used by the
group to imply violence against those who don't participate in the
strike.
   In Huancayo, 140 miles east of Lima, armed Shining Path
guerrillas forced employees of two radio stations Wednesday to
broadcast messages calling on people to obey a three-day strike
beginning Nov. 12.
   In May, about 1 million people in the Huancayo region obeyed the
call for a strike, stopping food supplies from reaching the capital.
   The Maoist rebels have assassinated more than 120 mayors, local
officials and candidates this year in its campaign to disrupt the
elections. About 400 candidates have quit out of fear.
   In Pomacocha, 295 miles southeast of Lima, rebels assassinated a
justice of the peace and the assistant police chief, police said
Wednesday. Rebels also killed the mayor and police chief of Raquia,
a town 125 miles north of Lima. The attacks occurred Tuesday,
police said.
   The Shining Path, based in the Andean highlands, launched its
insurgency against Peru's elected government in 1980. Warfare has
spread throughout much of the country. The government estimates
more than 15,000 people have died.

   Police found 13 more bodies in the
eastern town of Bhagalpur on Wednesday, bringing the death toll to
165 in Hindu-Moslem violence that began last week in Bihar state,
the United News of India reported.
   The news agency quoted government officials in Patna, the
capital of Bihar, as saying no violence was reported in the
Bhagalpur area on Wednesday.
   Curfew was lifted for two hours during the day, but troops
continued to patrol the town and surrounding areas, UNI said.
   Bhagalpur is about 110 miles east of Patna and 635 miles
southeast of New Delhi.
   Clashes broke out in the region on Oct. 26 after Hindu
fundamentalists organized processions celebrating the building of a
temple at a disputed spot in neighboring Uttar Pradesh state. The
site, near Ayodhya, is claimed as sacred by both Hindus and Moslems.
   Moslems form about 12 percent of India's 880 million people and
Hindus make up 80 percent.
   In Srinagar, summer capital of northern Jammu-Kashmir state,
police fired on rioting Moslem mobs on Wednesday, killing
18-year-old Abdul Rahman, reported S.S. Ali, a deputy
inspector-general of police.
   Ali said in a telephone interview from Srinagar that police
fired to quell a mob that was throwing stones and forcibly closing
shops to protest the wounding and arrest of Moslem separatist
leader Abdul Hameed Sheikh on Tuesday.
   Ali said at least 25 people were injured in protests in Srinagar
and nearby Anantnag, but UNI put the number at 70.
   Sheikh, who is agitating for secession of the state from India
and its assimilation in neighboring Pakistan, was injured in a
shootout with police and later arrested.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III told
Foreign Minister Moshe Arens by telephone Wednesday that he has
revised his Middle East peace offer following objections from
Israel, an Israeli offical said.
   Israel radio said the new draft, delivered to Arens Wednesday
night by U.S. Ambassador William Brown, gave Israel assurances that
known PLO members will be banned from talks, but left the door open
to indirect PLO participation. .
   The radio said Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, Finance Minister
Shimon Peres, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Arens _ the four
top leaders _ will meet Friday to discuss the modifications.
   Israel radio also said Wednesday the army plans to begin
deploying a reserve unit of Jewish settlers in the West Bank,
breaking a ban against assigning settler units to the occupied
territory.
   The move immediately brought protests from left-wing legislators
who complained use of settler companies could increase the violence
in the 22-month-old Palestinian uprising.
   Later Wednesday, Israeli TV, quoting defense sources, said
settler reserve units would not be deployed in the West Bank,
despite the previous reports.
   An Israeli official confirmed Baker spoke to Arens on Wednesday.
The official, who spoke on condition he not be identified, refused
to provide details of the plan.
   The reported changes in Baker's proposal calling for a
preliminary meeting on Israel's election plan with a Palestinian
delegation came a week after Arens wrote the American official
asking for key changes in the U.S. proposal.
   Arens insisted that Israel have the right to veto members of a
Palestinian delegation if they are tied to the Palestine Liberation
Organization and that Israeli-Palestinian talks be limited to the
Israeli offer for elections in the occupied territories.
   In the new draft, Baker said the Palestinian delegation may
discuss the elections plan and the process of negotiations but not
the content of negotiations, reports on Israel and army radio said.
   The reports said Baker also agreed to scrap the idea of a
meeting among U.S., Israeli and Egyptian officials in Washington to
discuss the makeup of the Palestinian delegation.
   Baker declined to give Israel a veto of individual members of
the delegation but said Israel can refuse to attend the meeting if
the Palestinian delegation is not acceptable, the reports said.
   The use of the word ``acceptable'' was not a change from Baker's
earlier plan, and the reported revised draft also seemed to fall
short of Arens' request that the PLO be banned from even indirect
participation in the talks.
   Since the start of the uprising in the occupied lands in
December 1987, 607 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli
soldiers and Jewish settlers. Forty Israelis also have died in the
violence.
   In the occupied territories Wednesday, soldiers shot a masked
protester in a demonstration and masked Palestinians beat and
critically injured a 60-year-old gas station attendant on suspicion
of cooperating with Israel.
   Palestinians have killed 138 of their fellow Arabs on suspicion
of cooperating with Israel.

<DATELINE>CAMP HILL, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The superintendent of the state prison at
Camp Hill was suspended Wednesday pending an investigation by an
independent panel into a two-day riot that left 123 people injured
last week.
   In a three-paragraph statement, Corrections Commission David
Owens Jr. said Robert M. Freeman, superintendent of the riot-torn
prison, was suspended based on information he received on Wednesday.
   The statement said Owens would not give a reason for the
suspension ``in order to preserve Superintendent Freeman's due
process rights and to maintain the integrity of the ongoing
investigation.''
   Two hours before the suspension was announced, The Associated
Press reported that prison guards said inmates were able to go on a
second rampage at the prison because officials did not fix broken
control boxes after the first night of riots.
   Gov. Robert P. Casey appointed the three-member commission
earlier this week to look into the uprising. The commission, headed
by former federal Judge Arlin Adams, is expected to release its
report on or before Dec. 1.
   Casey spokesman Vince Carocci said the governor concurred with
the decision to suspend Freeman.
   Freeman has an unlisted phone number and could not be reached
for comment at the prison.
   Corrections spokesman Kenneth Robinson said a decision on
whether Freeman will be suspended with or without pay has not yet
been determined.
   Erskind Deramus, deputy commissioner for programs, will serve as
acting superintendent, Robinson said.
   In the Associated Press interviews, several guards said they
alerted prison officials about the control box problem.
   More than 15 correctional officers said the prison
administration ignored the problem and said officials lied about
what time they secured the prison after last Wednesday's riot. A
prison spokeswoman stressed that the prison was under control when
officials said it was, at 10 p.m.
   Robinson would not say whether the information revealed in
Wednesday's Associated Press story had any bearing on Freeman's
suspension.
   The two nights of rioting left 123 people injured and destroyed
more than a dozen buildings. Prison officials said they expect to
transfer about 1,500 inmates to state and federal prisons.
   Prison officials would not comment Wednesday on the guards'
allegations.

   Army officers said
Wednesday only one-third of the 138 Palestinians killed by fellow
Arabs on suspicion of collaborating with Israeli authorities worked
with the military.
   ``Most of the men suspected as collaborators have no connection
with us,'' Brig. Gen. Zvi Poleg, military commander of the occupied
Gaza Strip, said on Israel radio. ``It's usually family disputes or
criminal matters or unknown.''
   On a tour of a seaside prison camp in the Gaza Strip
photojournalists were told the killing of suspected collaborators
in the Gaza Strip is often carried out under explicit orders from
the Islamic fundamentalist Hamas, or Zeal, movement, which contests
with the PLO for control of the Gaza Strip.
   A military official said some top Hamas leaders were caught by
the military, but continued to work from inside the prison camp,
dispatching orders through lawyers and freed prisoners.
   ``The top people of Hamas who are currently in prison run the
kingpins who replaced them in Gaza,'' the officer said.
   The officer works in the seaside prison dubbed Ansar II by
inmates after a prison in Lebanon used to hold Palestine Liberation
Organization fighters.
   He said only a third of the Arabs killed were actually involved
with the military.
   Inside the camp, the hundreds of inmates _ the army has not
released exact figures on the inmate population _ wear blue track
suits and many seemed in high spirits. One even clandestinely
flashed a ``V'' for victory sign as he sat in front of gun-toting
guards.
   The army brought photographers inside after reports the military
was carrying out a special ``initiated action'' aimed at detaining
masked activists who patrol Gaza armed with axes, clubs and iron
bars, to enforce uprising rules and kill collaborators.
   The army showed reporters five youths who were arrested while
wearring masks and patrolling a street in the Jabaliya refugee camp.
   Army regulations order soldiers to detain any masked activist
and to fire if the masked man refuses orders to stop.
   An official said Hamas has become increasingly brutal in recent
months, with four nurses killed by activists. One nurse was killed
with an ax while at work in a hospital ward.
   At least 8,500 Palestinians are in military prisons.

   Stray gunshots wounded young trick-or-treaters in Philadelphia
and Chicago and 230 people were arrested in New York terror sprees
during Halloween violence, authorities said.
   An 8-year-old girl was shot in the chest and a 13-year-old boy
in the buttocks as they walked from house to house in a
Philadelphia neighborhood rocked by drug activity.
   The children were caught in crossfire as four men chased a
fifth, witnesses said. Police suspect the gunfire was drug-related.
   Kateisha Dublin, 8, was in fair condition Wednesday in the
intensive care unit of Children's Hospital in Philadelphia after a
bullet was removed from her chest, hospital spokeswoman Yvonne
Vaughn said.
   ``I was out there giving out candy to the kids when four guys
come running down the street,'' said a witness who was afraid to
give his name. ``One guy came down the street first and four guys
came running behind him and started shooting. It was chaos.''
   The boy, Karriem Muhamed, was released from the hospital
Wednesday.
   In Chicago, a 4-year-old boy thrilled about his first night of
trick-or-treating was shot by a shopkeeper who darted from his
store and fired at teen-agers who had been harassing him, police
said.
   Brandon Shepherd was walking home with an aunt and four young
friends when he was hit by a stray bullet. He was in good condition
Wednesday at Loyola University Medical Center in suburban Maywood,
hospital spokesman Mike Maggio said.
   Many of those arrested Tuesday in New York were teen-agers who
smashed and looted small businesses and injured dozens of people,
police said.
   The violence left officials puzzled, with some saying Halloween
in New York is growing more dangerous every year.
   ``I don't know what we can attribute it to,'' said John J.
Holmes, an assistant police chief.
   Of the 230 people arrested, 46 were charged as youthful
offenders, a charge limited to those under the age of 16. Many were
clad in Halloween costumes or masks.
   Detroit Mayor Coleman Young said the three-day, fire-setting
spree in his city known as ``Devil's Night'' produced 223 fires
this year _ six fewer than last year in a Halloween tradition that
turned from soaping windows to arson about 10 years ago.
   Police arrested 399 minors on charges of ignoring the city's
three-day 6 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew, and eight people on arson
charges, officials said Wednesday.
   A 3-year-old Normangee, Texas, boy was in serious but stable
condition Wednesday after he was shot in the head when a pistol
worn by a worker at his day care center as part of her Halloween
costume went off.
   Kenny Archer was airlifted to Texas Children's Hospital in
Houston after four hours of surgery at a Bryan hospital.
   Authorities said the day care worker must have thought the
.22-caliber pistol she wore with a western costume was unloaded
when she brought it to the day care center Tuesday.
   It was not clear how the gun went off, Leon County Sheriff Royce
Wilson said.
   In other Halloween incidents:
   _ A 31-year-old woman in Champaign, Ill., was burned by a
caustic liquid thrown by someone wearing a devil mask when she ran
out of Halloween candy.
   _ A ball of wet tissue touched off a Halloween night fight
between black and white teen-agers in Collinsville, Ala., that
resulted in three arrests and prompted officers to order everyone
off the streets for the rest of the night.
   _ Vandals threw gasoline bombs and rocks at police and
firefighters in Nashville, Tenn., and a school bus was attacked.
Razor blades were found in two candy bars in Knox County.

   Hundreds of East Germans seized
the chance to go West on Wednesday, entering the West German
Embassy hours after East Germany lifted short-lived restrictions on
travel to Czechoslovakia.
   East German refugees said the number of East Germans in the
embassy in the Czechoslovak capital had risen to more than 500 by
late Wednesday afternoon. About 80 people had been waiting there
before the East German ban on visiting Czechoslovakia was lifted at
midnight Tuesday.
   The ban went into effect after more than 15,000 East Germans
jammed the same embassy last month and East Berlin was pressured to
allow them to travel West in special trains.
   The exodus of tens of thousands of East Germans to the West
through East bloc neighbors Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland in
recent weeks helped to hasten the fall of East German leader Erich
Honecker.
   Since Egon Krenz succeeded Honecker as Communist Party chief
Oct. 23, authorities in East Berlin have agreed to issue travel
documents for at least 150 East Germans who have turned up at the
West German Embassy in Prague. A similar arrangement is under
operation at the West German mission in Warsaw.
   The number of East Germans flocking to the Bonn mission in
Prague seemed likely to rise with the lifting of travel
restrictions, analysts said.
   It was not immediately known how the Prague government would
react this time, after previously allowing thousands of refugees to
leave Czechoslovakia for the West via East Germany.
   The flood of new arrivals, and a continuing flow of hundreds of
East Germans going west via Hungary and Austria each day suggests
that at least some of his countrymen are skeptical about promises
of reform made by Krenz.
   Krenz rescinded the travel ban imposed under Honecker and also
hinted that a new law giving East Germans greater travel freedom to
the West would be studied.
   Austrian officials said Wednesday 402 East Germans crossed to
Austria via Hungary en route to West Germany since Tuesday,
bringing to more than 48,000 the number of East German citizens who
have crossed to the West since Budapest opened the border to them
Sept. 11.

   President Daniel Ortega ended a
19-month truce with Contra guerrillas on Wednesday, blaming the
United States for renewed rebel attacks and accusing President Bush
of ``promoting death, assassination, crime and terrorism in
Nicaragua.''
   Ortega said the truce was being canceled because of increased
Contra attacks, including one last week he said killed 18 people
and another Monday that killed four.
   The White House denounced Ortega's decision to end the truce but
brushed off talk about renewing military aid for the Contras. ``We
don't want to give him any excuse'' to cancel elections scheduled
for next February, said presidential press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater.
   Ortega read a communique in which he said, ``Nicaragua reaffirms
once again that, regardless of the position assumed by the
mercenary forces, the electoral process culminating with the Feb.
25 elections will be guaranteed.''
   But, he said, replying heatedly to a reporter's question on U.S.
aid to the Contras, ``Now it will depend on the Yankee Congress and
the Yankee president whether these elections take place or not on
Feb. 25.''
   Alejandro Bendana, secretary-general at the Foreign Ministry,
emphasized later that Nicaragua had no plans to cancel the
elections. Commenting on possible renewed U.S. military aid to the
Contras, Bendana added, ``Obviously, if they let a bomb fall here
we can't have elections.''
   Ortega said U.S. aid to the Contras should be used only to
demobilize and resettle the army that has been trying to overthrow
his leftist Sandinista government.
   Fitzwater said in Washington no request for renewed military aid
was contemplated.
   The administration said Bush was consulting with leaders in
Central America to bring diplomatic pressure on Oretega to reverse
course.
   ``This has little to do with the military situation and much to
do with the electoral situation,'' said Virgilio Godoy, vice
presidential candidate of the National Opposition Union, a 14-party
coalition that is the Sandinistas' main election rival.
   Ortega declared in a live nationwide radio broadcast, ``We have
the responsibility for defending the lives of Nicaraguans.
Therefore we can't allow assassinations to be committed.''
   The Defense Ministry later Wednesday reported three recent
attacks by Contra forces that left eight people dead and 14
wounded. Three of the dead were civilians who were kidnapped and
subsequently killed, a ministry communique said.
   It said the attacks occurred Sunday, Monday and Tuesday in the
northern provinces of Matagalpa and Jinotega.
   His announcement was a blow to the Central American peace
process and the Aug. 7 agreements that called for disbanding the
Contras in exchange for moves toward democratization in Nicaragua.
   ``The Sandinistas are looking for excuses not to hold
elections,'' Contra commander Enrique Bermudez told The Associated
Press in Tegucigalpa, Honduras.
   The Contras were not a party to the peace accords and Contra
field commanders have said they will not abide by them.
   Bermudez said the Contras would continue to observe the
cease-fire except to defend themselves. He said he recognized that
renewed U.S. military aid was unlikely, but called it ``the only
option.''
   At U.N. headquarters in New York, Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar summoned Nicaraguan Ambassador Alejandro Serrano Caldera
to strongly protest Ortega's decision.
   ``We do not agree with Ortega's decision ... because it
jeopardizes the peace process that Nicaragua was following, '' said
President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica, who won the 1987 Nobel Peace
Prize for spearheading efforts for peace.
   Arias' press secretary, Jorge Urbina, later said ``the
government of Costa Rica is profoundly disappointed by this
decision.''
   Ortega said more than 1,100 Contra fighters had infiltrated
Nicaragua from Honduras the past three weeks and rebel attacks had
``increased dramatically.'' He asked for a Nov. 6-7 meeting at
United Nations headquarters to ``approve the logistical and
technical matters'' to decomission the Contras.
   Ortega said his government had made every effort to promote
democracy in the region and in Nicaragua and to have elections.
   ``And what has been the response of the North American
government to this effort? In the first place, with the North
American government having the chance to contribute to peace, it
hasn't done so.
   ``President Bush is not contributing to peace; President Bush is
promoting war, he's promoting death, assassination, crime,
terrorism in Nicaragua.''
   The U.S. Congress recently approved $9 million for the
opposition coalition; Ortega said the electoral opposition and the
Contras ``represent the same counter-revolutionary current; both
are mercenary forces at the service of the North American policy.''
   Ortega contends the Contras have routinely violated the truce
since it was signed in March 1988, a month after Congress suspended
military aid to the rebels. He said that in 19 months, Contra
attacks in Nicaragua killed more than 730 people and wounded more
than 1,000, mostly civilians.
   The cease-fire was never formalized and the Sandinistas extended
it on a monthly basis. Contra leaders said they viewed the truce as
indefinite. Most Contra troops moved into camps in Honduras and
fighting dipped sharply inside Nicaragua, although it never ceased
completely.
   The United States has continued to supply non-lethal aid,
including boots and uniforms and other military items, but U.S.
officials say they have urged the Contras not to launch attacks
inside Nicaragua.
   U.S. officials said they wanted the Contras to remain a force in
being to pressure the Sandinistas to keep the Feb. 25 elections
fair, but did not want them to move out of the camps.

<HEAD>Beverly Hills Teachers Narrowly Approve Pact</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Teachers narrowly approved a
contract Wednesday to end a 13-day walkout that threw education
into chaos in an enclave known for wealth and extravagance.
   The teachers voted 150 to 133 to ratify an agreement giving them
a 15 percent salary hike over two years. They will also get a 1
percent pay raise if a land tax is approved by voters in the spring
elections.
   Teachers, nurses and counselors were expected to return to
schools in the 4,700-student district on Thursday.
   Ballots were cast after a closed five-hour debate between
negotiators and members of the Beverly Hills Education Association
gathered at the Beverly Hilton Hotel.
   Afterwards, it was clear many disapproved of the terms in the
agreement.
   ``There's no question in my mind they left negotiations
yesterday feeling it was the best they could do,'' said economics
teacher Stuart Horowitz, who voted no. ``I simply feel they were
beaten at the negotiation process.''
   ``This is very depressing and frustrating,'' said teacher
Sachiko Morrey.
   During Tuesday's 5{-hour bargaining session that produced the
contract, about 200 striking teachers marched outside district
headquarters in a show of solidarity. Some carried signs reading,
``Gucci Mentality _ Pic 'N Save Salaries.''
   It was an unusual strike, with teachers on the picket line
eating food catered from Spago, a well-known restaurant.
   Concerned parents volunteered more than $500,000 to fulfill
teacher salary demands in the city where the ultra-rich rub elbows
with movie stars and shop at expensive stores on Rodeo Drive.
   On Monday, more than 100 angry parents and students, some
threatening to launch a recall against school board members, joined
picketing teachers to lobby for an end to the strike.
   About 300 of the school district's 315 teachers, counselors and
nurses walked off the job Oct. 16 seeking better pay. Top pay for
teachers in Beverly Hills is $46,270 and averages $42,659.
   One of the issues in the strike was starting pay of teachers,
which is $21,604 annually, nearly $6,000 less than in neighboring
Los Angeles.

<HEAD>Duchess of York Counters Critics</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's Duchess of York says she left her
newborn daughter to join her husband in Australia last year because
she had looked ``rather enormous'' for nine months and ``it was his
turn.''
   In an interview for broadcast on ABC Wednesday night, Barbara
Walters asked the former Sarah Ferguson about the criticism she
received when she left her 6-week-old daughter Beatrice behind last
fall to join her husband, Prince Andrew, on a 10-day tour of
Australia.
   ``He was more important at the time,'' said the duchess, 30.
   ``I love ... Beatrice,'' she said, ``and she's great, and
children are great, but, you know, you've had nine months of
looking rather enormous and big, and your poor husband's had to
look at you like that. ... It was his turn for just a couple of
weeks.''
   The duchess, who is pregnant again, spends three days a week
apart from her child, but said the time they spend apart only makes
their time together better.
   ``The time we're with her is such fun,'' she said. ``(She) is
continually laughing, which is so much ... more healthy than a
child with grumpy parents.''
   The duchess spends the week at an apartment in Buckingham Palace
in London; Beatrice comes up two days a week. They spend weekends
together in Windsor.
   The duchess said her own childhood was normal and ``naughty,''
full of such pranks as putting glue on the mathematics teacher's
chair and dye in the school's water system.
   ``I'm a little wild,'' she said. ``I'm a spontaneous person. ...
I have to be controlled now. ... I just have to rein back a bit,
and just say, now steady on. Just perhaps don't say too much, or
don't do this, or don't do that.''
   The duchess also described herself as old-fashioned: ``The most
important thing is to keep your husband happy. ... Husband first
... home happy, children happy, and then you can think about
yourself.''

<DATELINE>PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The South African army is on alert
because of a reported guerrilla incursion into Namibia and next
week's pre-independence elections could be delayed, Foreign
Minister R.F. Botha said Wednesday.
   Botha told a news conference U.N. military observers monitoring
Namibia's transition from South African rule to independence
reported the incursions from Angola in radio messages to each other
and were too frightened to intervene. The U.N. force denied it.
   Leaders of the South-West Africa People's Organization, which
fought a 23-year bush war for independence, said none of their
guerrillas were crossing the border. SWAPO is expected to get the
most votes in a five-day election starting Tuesday for seats in an
assembly that will draft a constitution.
   A statement from the U.N. Transition Assistance Group released
at U.N. headquarters in New York and in Windhoek, Namibia, said:
``It has been established that the messages do not emanate from any
UNTAG source.
   ``It continues to be the case that UNTAG is unable to confirm
allegations that SWAPO PLAN combatants are present in southern
Angola.''
   PLAN refers to the SWAPO fighting force, the People's Liberation
Army of Namibia.
   Chief U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani told reporters in New
York that Botha telephoned Secretary-Geneeral Javier Perez de
Cuellar ``to inform the secretary-general of his allegations.''
   Botha said in Pretoria that members of his staff intercepted
messages from U.N. observers mentioning the infiltration of vehicle
convoys and more than 600 guerrillas from Oct. 23 through Tuesday.
   ``Unless this is resolved within days, the South African
government is reserving the right to take whatever steps would be
required to ensure that all parties comply with their
obligations,'' he told the news conference. ``The South African
security forces have been put on alert.''
   Andimba Toivo Ja Toivo, secretary-general of SWAPO, said Botha's
assertion was ``another concoction by the South African government
in a bid to sabotage the election.''
   ``It is well known that the South African government sends its
own troops dressed in other armies' clothing when it wishes to
fabricate an offensive maneuver by an army that has laid down its
arms,'' he said.
   Botha said the intercepted messages ``made it clear that SWAPO
warned the UNTAG patrols they they shouldn't interfere or they
would be shot. The tendency of UNTAG is that they are wishing to
evacuate, to run.''
   He said UNTAG ``is certainly not doing its job; it is frightened
to do it properly where SWAPO is involved.''
   ``If this threat cannot be removed and if these activities
continue, then there cannot be a free and fair election,'' the
foreign minister declared. ``We decided to reveal this in an
attempt to stop this and to save the process, to save the
elections.''
   The guerrillas had bases in Angola during the long guerrilla
war, but are not supposed to have armed personnel in Namibia or
near the border during the transition. South Africa also withdrew
its troops from the territory.
   On April 1, the official start of the transitional period, South
Africa said hundreds of guerrillas had crossed the border. South
Africa received U.N. permission to deploy its troops, and about 280
guerrillas and 27 members of the security forces were killed.
   South Africa captured Namibia from Germany in World War I and
governed it under a League of Nations mandate. The United Nations
ended the mandate in 1966, but South Africa refused to leave.
   In December, it signed agreements with Angola and Cuba under
which the U.N. independence plan would be accompanied by withdrawal
of the 50,000 Cuban soldiers stationed in Angola.

<TEXT>
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who
helped reverse decades of confrontation with the United States,
called for even better relations on Wednesday, saying they are ``of
special significance to Mexico.''
   ``Relations with such a powerful neighbor, with the most complex
common border in the world and a history burdened by acts of
extreme aggression, will never be easy,'' Salinas told a joint
session of Congress in his first state of the union speech.
   ``Nevertheless, there is no reason our relations should always
be bad or tense.''
   Relations over three previous administrations were marred by
disagreements and mutual accusations on a wide range of issues,
from alleged mistreatment of Mexican illegal aliens to U.S. trade
barriers, corruption and drug trafficking.
   Salinas said he has been making special effort to improve
relations since taking office Dec. 1 in ``a positive, respectful
atmosphere'' that ``does not stem from a change in our principles,
but from a change in circumstances.''
   ``We reject confrontation as being senseless, and submission as
being offensive to our firmest convictions. We view the future with
assurance, without ignoring a difficult past,'' he added.
   Salinas said U.S.-Mexican trade has been growing since Mexico
joined the 103-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in
1986 and lifted many of its trade barriers.
   Mexico now is seeking to broaden its exports of iron, steel and
textiles to the United States, he said.
   He also said that increased cooperation in combating drug
trafficking has brought positive results.
   Salinas indicated, however, that Mexico will pursue its
traditional policy of non-intervention, opposing any outside
interference with Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government or in
Panama.
   ``The situation in Central America remains delicate,'' Salinas
said.
   He expressed support for a regional peace plan aimed at
negotiating an end to the war between Nicaragua's government and
the U.S.-supported rebels and to leftist guerrilla insurrections in
El Salvador and Guatemala.
   He said Mexico defends ``the rights of the Panamanian people to
self-determination.''
   But he took a swipe at Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, Panama's
Defense Forces chief, saying, ``We made a distinction between
defending such principles and protecting those who have hindered
the progress of a nation.''
   Noriega was indicted on U.S. drug trafficking charges in
February 1988, and the United States has been trying to get him
ousted.
   Salinas also said Mexico is ``seeking to increase economic and
cultural relations'' with President Fidel Castro's communist regime
in Cuba, and ``in the field of finance, we agreed to respond
sensitively and responsibly to conditions in both countries.''
   He did not elaborate.
   Salinas said Mexico will press for closer relations with the
rest of Latin America and seek trade opportunities with Japan,
China and other Far East countries.
   ``One of the concerns of my administration is to extend Mexico's
presence in the Pacific Basin, the most dynamic zone of economic
growth and technological innovation,'' he said. ``We are therefore
reorienting diplomatic and consular actions in the region.''

   Mayoral candidates Rudolph Giuliani and David
Dinkins agreed Wednesday to appear together in at least one
televised debate, less than a week before the election.
   Dinkins, the Democratic candidate, and Giuliani, the Republican,
will debate on WABC-TV Saturday night, said Peter Powers,
Giuliani's campaign manager. The election is Tuesday.
   The announcement came after Giuliani's campaign dropped a
previous stipulation that such debates only include Dinkins and
Giuliani. Right-to-Life candidate Henry Hewes is expected to appear
in Saturday's debate.
   The three men also will appear on WNBC-TV's ``NewsForum''
program Sunday morning, Powers said. That appearance could turn
into a debate because of the show's interview format, he said.
   If Dinkins wins the election in the heavily Democratic city, he
would become the city's first black elected mayor.
   Wednesday's announcement did not mention Ronald Lauder, who was
defeated by Giuliani in the Republican primary and is running on
the Conservative Party ticket.

   The National People's Congress Standing Committee ruled Tuesday
that Sezto Wah and Martin Lee could no longer serve on the Hong
Kong-China Basic Law Committee.
   The committee is drafting the constitution for the territory
when it reverts to Chinese rule in 1997.
   The two members of Hong Kong's Legislative Council told
reporters the Chinese action was also an attempt to make them
apologize for their criticism of Beijing's military crackdown on
the pro-democracy movement in June.
   Lee appealed to the Chinese government not to penalize people in
this British colony for their criticism and said he hoped ``the
punishment would stop'' with their expulsion.
   The two legislators are also members of a Hong Kong alliance in
support of the ``patriotic democratic movement'' in China.
   Beijing's official Xinhua News Agency reported Tuesday that the
decision to expel the two men were based on a report by Ji Pengfei,
chairman of the Basic Law Committee and head of the Hong Kong and
Macao Affairs Office in the Chinese government.
   It said the National People's Congress noted Sezto and Lee said
they would not participate in drafting law with the current Chinese
government and had called for re-examination of the 1940
Chinese-British agreement on the return of the territory to Chinese
rule in 1997.
   China has pledged to retain Hong Kong's capitalistic and legal
system for 50 years after 1997, but the crackdown on the
pro-democracy movement has raised fears about Chinese interference
in Hong Kong's affairs.

   Children were raped, sodomized and forced to
take part in nude sex games and satanic rituals at the McMartin
Pre-School, a prosecutor said during closing arguments Wednesday in
the longest criminal trial in U.S. history.
   Deputy District Attorney Lael Rubin urged a Superior Court jury
not to be taken in by what she called the loving ``facade''
presented by defendants Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy
McMartin Buckey.
   Buckey, 31, and his mother, 62, are charged with 64 counts of
child molestation and one count of conspiracy. The charges are
linked to the alleged molestations of 11 children at the
now-defunct McMartin Pre-School in suburban Manhattan Beach.
   ``It is a mistake, it is unfair and it is unconscionable to
simply discount the children's testimony because certain statements
seem unbelievable,'' Ms. Rubin said.
   ``When you assess it all, you will see loud and clear there were
some pretty awful things that went on at that preschool at the
hands of Raymond and Peggy Buckey.''
   Buckey and his mother were among seven people arrested in 1983.
Charges were dropped against the other five for lack of evidence.
   Jurors were to begin deliberations in the 2{-year trial after
receiving instructions from Judge William Pounders on Thursday.
   During his earlier closing arguments, defense attorney Danny
Davis said medical evidence presented at trial was faulty and the
children were coached in their testimony.
   He maintained that the prosecution's case was built on
``insinuations, excuses and lame rationale.''
   The trial is the longest and most expensive criminal proceeding
in U.S. history, with a price tag estimated at $15 million.
   A jury of 12 and six alternates began the trial in April 1987.
During the years, job problems and illness plagued the jury,
leaving the bare dozen panelists needed to deliberate and avoid a
mistrial.

   Scores of armed men rampaged through
two villages in central Sri Lanka on Wednesday, burning at least 50
houses and killing at least 31 people, officials and residents said.
   The government reported at least 35 other killings across the
Sinhalese heartland in southern and central Sri Lanka in a 24-hour
span ending Wednesday morning.
   The attack on the adjoining villages of Galanewa and
Thambuttegama, 100 miles north of Colombo, was apparently in
revenge for the landmine destruction of a police jeep on Tuesday in
which four policemen were killed, said residents in the
north-central Anuradhapura district contacted by telephone.
   The residents, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said those
killed were suspected members of the People's Liberation Front, a
radical Sinhalese group fighting to overthrow the government.
   The victims included several women, they said. All were shot in
the head and their bodies burned.
   Military officials, who cannot be identified under briefing
rules, said a senior army officer, Col. Ananda Weerasundera, was
being sent to investigate. Opposition politicians and human rights
groups have accused security forces of resorting to indiscriminate
killings of suspected radicals in the confrontation between
ultranationalist Sinhalese and the government.
   The government has denied it, but senior officials privately
admit security forces may have committed excesses.
   Military officials said at least 17 people, including four
women, were found slain near Laggala, 85 miles southeast of
Colombo. They blamed the People's Liberation Front, saying police
found notes beside the bodies reading: ``Punishment for the
traitors to the organization.''
   Government officials accused the People's Liberation Front of
killing at least 12 other people in separate attacks.
   In addition, the bodies of six radicals or supporters were found
Tuesday in the Sinhalese heartland, including two in Colombo.
Officials blamed the deaths on vigilante groups avenging attacks on
soldiers and government supporters.
   Sinhalese radicals began their bloody challenge of the
Sinhalese-dominated government's authority in 1987, saying the
government conceded too much in its efforts to make peace with
separatist guerrillas from the Tamil minority.
   Sinhalese make up 75 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people.
Tamils comprise 18 percent.
   Tamils say the Sinhalese discriminate against them in jobs,
education and use of the Sinhala language.

   Gunmen assassinated a federal judge in
Medellin and a congressman in this capital Wednesday night in the
latest wave of violence to strike Colombia since the government
declared war on drug traffickers.
   Terrorists in two cars fatally shot Judge Mariela Espinoza, the
second justice official slain since the government began its
crackdown on traffickers 11 weeks ago.
   At about the same time, the congressman, Luis Francisco Madero,
was shot as he arrived home Wednesday night in Bogota, a national
police spokeswoman said. Madero, 66, of the opposition Conservative
Party, died minutes later at a hospital a few blocks away, the
spokeswoman said.
   Madero was considered a foe of the traffickers. He organized a
demonstration to protest trafficking in Pacho, a city 60 miles
north of Bogota, said a Conservative presidential contender, Sen.
Alvaro Leyva Duran.
   There was no claim of responsibility for Wednesday's killings,
police said, though suspicion fell on hitmen hired by the
traffickers.
   Mrs. Espinoza, a 43-year-old lawyer who had been appointed a
judge six months ago, was assassinated as she opened the garage
door of her home in western Medellin, the hub of the most powerful
drug cartel in Colombia, the radio chain Caracol said.
   Mrs. Espinoza had just arrived home and was accompanied by two
police bodyguards on motorcycles at the time of the shooting, and
one of the policemen and a passer-by were wounded, Caracol said in
a report from the city of 2 million residents about 150 miles north
of Bogota.
   The assassins fled in their cars, police said by telephone.
   Hours after the assassinations, a bomb went off in eastern
Bogota at the entrance to a Mormon church. The church sustained
minor damages but was closed at the time so no one was injured,
police said.
   The government declared a crackdown on drug traffickers after
the leading presidential candidate, Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, was
assassinated Aug. 18 by drug barons. The government reinstated an
extradition treaty with the United States and began confiscating
property belonging to the drug lords.
   Since then, drug traffickers have been blamed for scores of
shootings and bombings that have killed 36 people and injured 223.
   Traffickers responded with the violence in an effort to persuade
the government of President Virgilio Barco to end its extradition
of drug suspects.
   The administration has extradited five alleged traffickers to
the United States, where they will face trial. In Colombia, drug
lords have received relative impunity by paying off or intimidating
the nation's judges.
   In the past 10 years, 221 court employees, including 42 judges,
have been killed. On Sept. 21, Justice Minister Monica de Greiff
resigned following death threats from traffickers.
   The traffickers in an Aug. 23 message to a national radio
station vowed to kill 10 judges for every drug trafficker
extradited to the United States to face trial.
   Another federal judge, Hector Jimenez, was killed Oct. 17 in
Medellin by gunmen firing from a motorcycle.
   Judges and thousands of court employes called a three-day strike
after that killing, demanding bodyguards, bulletproof vests and
cars and metal detectors at entrances to their offices.
   Leaders of the Medellin cartel have asked for peace talks five
times the past two months.
   They offered to lay down their arms, end a terrorist bombing
campaign and abandon the drug business if the government will grant
them amnesty and stop extraditing traffickers to the United States.
   Barco has refused.
   U.S. officials say the Medellin cartel and a rival organization
in Cali are responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine sold in the
United States.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of residents packed City Council
chambers to call for an incumbent councilman's resignation after he
reportedly made a racial slur about the late U.S. Rep. Mickey
Leland.
   ``Racism hurts all decent people,'' said JoAnn Gavin of a group
called the All Peoples Congress. ``Houston does not need a racist
to represent our city. ... Racism is not negotiable.''
   Councilman Jim Westmoreland joked to a newspaper reporter Oct.
18 that Houston Intercontinental Airport be renamed ``Nigger
International'' to appease council members pushing to rename the
airport as a memorial to Leland, who was killed in an August plane
crash in Ethiopia, The Houston Post reported.
   But Westmoreland, a 16-year incumbent seeking re-election to his
at-large seat next week, claims he used the term ``Negro
International.''
   Westmoreland apologized for the comment last Friday and again
Wednesday morning. He said the matter has overshadowed other
campaign issues and prompted threats against him and his family.
   ``Any anguish this has caused anyone could not match the anguish
I've suffered and my family,'' he said. ``I'm truly sorry for my
comments.''
   But few at the hearing were appeased.
   ``We tell a joke and our friends hear it,'' Skipper Lee, one of
39 residents to address the hearing, said to Westmoreland. ``You
tell a joke and the next day, it's on the streets of New York City.
You don't just speak for yourself. You speak for Houston. We look
up to you and we can't look up to a racist.''
   Westmoreland listened intently to the speakers, but said they
did not convince him to resign.
   ``The question of resignation is one I don't think we have to
make because we have a vote coming up,'' he said. ``With all the
publicity this has generated, there's no one going to the polls who
won't know what the situation has been.''
   Armed guards turned away nearly as many as those allowed inside
the packed chambers, with crowds spilling into hallways on two
floors. Most of the also criticized Mayor Kathy Whitmire and black
council members for not speaking out strongly against the slur.
   ``Kathy, I never dreamed that you _ someone who has been
outspoken for the people _ would have taken two to three weeks to
stand up for your black brothers and sisters,'' said the Rev. Jose
Angel Lopez.
   ``Minority members of this council have not stood up and spoken
out against this,'' said Nelva Polk, a sixth grade teacher.
   She said she saw repercussions of Westmoreland's statement in
her classroom Tuesday when one student called another a ``nigger.''
She said when she reprimanded the student for the language, he
responded, ``That white man on TV said it.''
   Mrs. Whitmire set a special council session for Friday to
discuss a resolution against racist remarks. On Wednesday, she told
reporters she has refrained from making any public comment on
Westmoreland because she believed the voters would decide the issue.
   ``If he worked for me, I would have asked for his resignation,''
she said.

   President Bush is drawing bipartisan praise
with his announcement of a seawater summit Dec. 2-3 with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to discuss ``dynamic change'' in the
communist world.
   Bush, making the announcement Tuesday, said the meeting will not
focus on strategic arms reduction talks but instead will allow the
leaders ``to put up our feet'' and ``deepen our respective
understanding of each other's views.''
   ``I don't want to have two gigantic ships pass in the night
because of failed communication,'' Bush said. ``I just didn't want
to _ in this time of dynamic change _ miss something, something
that I might get better firsthand from Mr. Gorbachev.''
   The December meeting, to be held on U.S. and Soviet warships on
alternate days in the Mediterranean Sea, would be the first
presidential meeting between Bush and Gorbachev. They met
previously in New York on Dec. 7, 1988, when Bush was vice
president and president-elect.

   Legislation raising the minimum wage to $4.25
an hour by April 1991 is on the fast track in Congress, following a
compromise between the Bush administration and Democratic leaders
that ends an eight-year stalemate.
   The House planned to vote on the proposal today and Senate
leaders promised action before Thanksgiving. Barring unforeseen
problems, President Bush could sign the bill by then as well,
triggering the first minimum wage increase in nine years on April
1, 1990.
   The measure would create a new ``subminimum wage'' for
teen-agers with little job experience, allowing them to be paid 85
percent of the minimum wage for their first three months in the
work force. The lower rate could be extended for another three
months if an employer showed that the youths were receiving
specific skills training.
   ``This package offers the promise of better wages for the
working men and women of this country and gives incentives to
create new jobs for our young people,'' Bush said in a written
statement that commended organized labor and congressional leaders.

   The country's largest labor
federation called for a nationwide general strike today to protest
a bombing that tore up the union hall of a leftist affiliate,
killing 10 people and wounding 29.
   The federation also exhorted workers to take to the streets in a
massive funeral procession for those killed Tuesday at the
headquarters of the National Federation of Salvadoran Workers, or
Fenastras.
   The attack at Fenastras followed a pre-dawn bombing at the
offices of Comadres, a human rights group, in which four people
were slightly wounded. Leaders of both organizations blamed the
armed forces for the attacks.
   Government and army spokesmen routinely characterize Fenastras
and Comadres _ the Committee of Mothers of Political Prisoners,
Disappeared and Assassinated of El Salvador _ as fronts for leftist
guerrillas.

   The bodies of Joyce Ann Mabry, 31, of Berkeley, and James J.

   The protester who started the furor over flag
burning says it's ``a miscarriage of justice'' that he won't be
part of the first court test of the nation's new flag protection
law.
   ``This is a case of selective non-prosecution,'' attorney
William Kunstler complained Tuesday after the government decided
not to charge Gregory Johnson, who was arrested with three other
demonstrators during a flag-burning protest Monday on the Capitol
steps.
   Johnson's conviction for burning a flag at the 1984 Republican
National Convention led to the Supreme Court ruling in June that
such activity is protected under the First Amendment.
   Charges were filed Tuesday against the other three protesters,
but the U.S. attorney's office said there was insufficient evidence
to charge Johnson.

   Utah voters will decide whether the state

the International Olympic Committee will make its final choice in
June 1991. The city is competing with Nagano, Japan; Jaca, Spain;
Ostersund, Sweden; and Sochi, in the Soviet Union.
   The IOC could make Salt Lake City ``an Olympic city
forevermore,'' said Tom Welch, chairman of the city's Winter Games
Organizing Committee. ``That's one reason the public financing of a

by and large, suppport it.''
   A non-binding referendum on Tuesday's ballot will ask whether
Utah should divert a fraction of its sales tax during the next

<HEAD>Israeli Theaters Free of Censor for Trial Period</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICOLAS B. TATRO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli theater is free of censors for the
first time after parliament suspended the blue pencils for a
two-year trial period.
   Liberal lawmakers are now trying to end censorship of movies and
ease military censorship of the media, but they are almost certain
to be defeated in both efforts. Few plays were actually banned, but
playwrights had constant battles with censors over scenes, lines
and even words. Several complained this produced artistic
hesitation and self-censorship.
   The move to free plays of control was hailed on all sides as
long overdue for a country that values its democratic tradition.
   ``In a democracy, there is nothing more loathesome than
censorship,'' said Mordechai Vershuvski, a Citizens Rights Movement
lawmaker who led a successful, nine-year effort against censorship.
   Miriam Kainy, head of the 50-member Playwrights Association,
said ending censorship would mature Israeli playwrights, who have
held back and felt a reluctance to ``go all the way'' with their
work and ideas.
   ``The existence of the censor is an example of our
conservativeness, our wanting to have a father to tell us what to
do,'' she said. ``The fact that you don't have to send a text to a
censor will mature us.''
   Yehoshua Justman, head of the 27-member Theater and Movie
Censorship Board appointed by the Interior Ministry, which is
controlled by an ultra-Orthodox religious party, said the panel had
been very liberal in approving scripts and denied it had an
anti-left bias.
   In the past decade, he said, the board had banned outright only
three or four Arab productions and one Israeli play, ``Ephraim
Returns to the Army.''
   ``Ephraim Returns'' is the story of a well-intentioned but
morally weak West Bank commander who allows a group of right-wing
Israelis to escape punishment for shooting an Arab demonstrator.
   The board, which reviewed 50 to 60 scripts a year, ruled the
play impuned the honor of the army and incited Israeli Arabs to
violence by comparing Israeli rule in the occupied territories to
that of the Nazi Germans in Europe. The Supreme Court overturned
the decision in 1987, curtailing the power of the board and
clearing the way for parliament's move in August to suspend
censorship altogether.
   Yitzhak Laor, author of ``Ephraim Returns,'' said he believed
the play was banned in part because of his own activism against the
Lebanon war and his refusal to serve as a soldier in the West Bank.
   ``The Israeli establishment has traditionally feared the
theater. It uses security considerations to cloak the political
considerations,'' Laor said in an interview.
   Despite the lifting of formal censorship, pressure could still
be exerted through how theaters are financed. Israeli theaters rely
on grants from city hall and the education ministry as well as
managements that, in times of economic recession, are more
interested in popular plays.
   Tom Levy, a director and head of Tel Aviv University's theater
department, said the suspension of theater censorship was easy for
parliament because plays were increasingly non-political.
   ``The Israeli public doesn't want to hear about the Palestinian
issue,'' he said, adding the recent success of imported productions
such as ``Les Miserables'' and ``Cabaret'' was proof of theater
being used as ``an emotional sleeping pill.''
   In movies, Justman indicated the board, which reviews about 250
films a year, would not slacken its censorship of extreme violence
and sex. But he said only about four movies a year were prohibited,
and ``we never ban a film for politics.''
   In the most recent case, the board banned Martin Scorsese's
``The Last Temptation of Christ,'' citing a law that prohibits
practices offensive to religious beliefs. The Supreme Court
overturned the decision, saying the film was unlikely to offend or
arouse those who chose to see it.
   Vershuvski said many lawmakers who voted to end theater
censorship would not agree to lift film censorship because movies
reached a much larger audience and had a big impact on youth.
   He urges the use of a rating system, which Justman said would be
inadequate, and new legislation that would require extremely
violent or pornographic films to be shown in special movie houses.
Trying to ban such movies is pointless, he said, since most are
available on video cassettes.
   Parliament also set up a subcommittee to examine the role of the
military censor, who is supposed to oversee newspapers, books and
broadcast media for leaks that endanger state security.
   Yossi Sarid, a liberal member of parliament, said reform was
needed because censorship had been inappropriately used by the
government for non-security reasons and side-stepped by foreign
journalists who did not submit stories for advanced review.
   ``Censorship is one of those things we can't live with or
without,'' he said. ``On the one hand, it harms principles that are
dear to us. But on the other hand, our security situation requires
it. This is the thin rope we have to walk on.''

   Prison is a mean and ugly place. Life is
defined by roll call and steel bars, and, as singer James Taylor
put it, time is measured by ``a clock with no hands.''
   But for Baptist preacher Gary Sims, the Ohio director for Prison
Fellowship Ministries, the state's nine juvenile and 21 adult
prisons are fertile ground.
   ``If you look for bad, you find bad,'' said Sims, 35, who
prefers the title chaplain to reverend. ``I think Mother Teresa was
asked, `Mother Teresa, why are you still in the streets?' ... and
she said, `When I see people on the street, I see Christ.'
   ``When I look,'' Sims said, ``I see Christ in those people _
regardless if that person's in for rape, murder, whatever the
situation may be. I think that there is a seed in every person that
demonstrates the love of God. And that person has the potential of
being changed. I'm not saying that he will change, that he will
choose to change, but there is always that possibility.''
   Sims, an intense and quiet man, is no naive do-gooder. He knows
that three of every four inmates he sees likely will do time again,
that drugs, poverty, poor education and despair create a vicious
cycle that few can break.
   ``It's unrealistic to think that the ratio of your having an
effect would be 85 percent. Maybe 2 or 3 (percent). And sometimes
you may not see a person make any positive change in maybe three
years. But you're planting seeds. And someone will come along and
water that seed,'' he said.
   Sims came to Ohio's prisons in a roundabout manner. After
obtaining a master's degree in education and special education from
Duquesne University in Pittsburgh and spending several years
teaching school, his call to the ministry took him to the
Pittsburgh Theological Seminary, and later back to Duquesne. He
planned to become a hospital chaplain.
   He put in a year's internship in clinical pastoral education but
couldn't find a hospital job. ``That opened this door here, to be a
chaplain at the Orient (Ohio) Correctional Institution,'' he said.
   After a year as a state-paid chaplain at Orient and 2{ years at
the Ohio Correctional Reception Center, Sims on July 31 was named
to head the Ohio office of the privately financed Prison Fellowship
Ministries. The interdenominational program was founded by
Watergate figure Charles W. Colson in 1976 and is now active in 550
federal and state institutions.
   ``For lack of a better term, one has to be bilingual,'' Sims
said. ``I say bilingual in the sense that it is a different
culture, it is a different world. It is just like going into an
area of missionary work. People go into different countries _ South
America, the Middle East, Africa _ yet there's missionary work
right here in America.''
   The work, with its 14-hour days, sob stories that must be taken
with a grain of salt and burden of bearing additional bad news to
people whose lives are bounded by bars, is hard.
   Sims said that to the best of his knowledge, no state or federal
money is spent on his program, which has a 1990 budget of $120,000
and is financed largely through private donations. He plans to open
a Cleveland regional office, then regional offices for each corner
of the state and in Columbus.
   Sims said he had never been imprisoned, but he is not a stranger
to the personal effects of crime. His home has been burglarized,
his truck stolen and someone tried to break into his car, he said.
   ``You definitely feel violated, you feel angry, and I think as a
parent you think more of your family's safety than anything,'' he
said.
   But he is not interested in seeing the culprits imprisoned
simply for the sake of punishment.
   ``I think that the principle of Prison Fellowship is restorative
justice. Not that the person go to jail and the state gets paid,
but as a victim I get paid,'' he said.
   ``Let that person do some community work ... so that the person
can understand, hey, you've offended someone, you've violated
someone, and the reason why you're doing this type of work'' is to
pay a debt to society in a meaningful way.
   Sims described his job as attacking the vicious circle of
prison, parole and back to prison in a manner consistent with what
he believes God planned.
   ``Whatever he chooses for me to do, I will do it,'' Sims said.
``Gary didn't want to be in prison ministry; I wanted to be a
hospital chaplain. But God said: `No, that's not where I want you
now. This is where I've called you to be.'''

<HEAD>Shera Danese Makes Third Appearance on `Columbo'</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Actress Shera Danese, in her third appearance
on ``Columbo,'' is getting closer to her ambition to be the killer
unmasked by the deceptively shrewd detective.
   ``My first time on the show I was a secretary,'' she said. ``The
second time I was the killer's secretary. This time I'm the
killer's wife.''
   Her earlier appearances were on ``Columbo'' when it was on NBC
in the 1970s. She will be on the show tentatively scheduled for
``The ABC Saturday Mystery Movie'' on Nov. 25.
   Danese is married to ``Columbo'' star Peter Falk but says that
has not helped her get the roles. They met when she had a small
role in ``Mikey and Nicky,'' which was filmed in her hometown of
Philadelphia.
   ``After we married I decided to go back to work and Peter had
his agent sign me,'' she said. ``He got me a part on `Columbo,' so
Peter left him. I think Peter thought I'd stay home and do nothing.
The first time the producer hired me and Peter didn't know. The
second time Peter made me read for the part.''
   Danese also has a starring role in a CBS comedy pilot called
``Mulberry Street.''
   If it's picked up by CBS it will be her third series. She was
Tim Conway's girlfriend in ``Ace Crawford, Private Eye'' in 1983.
She was a model and Suzanne Pleshette's best friend in ``Suzanne
Pleshette Is Maggie Briggs'' in 1984.
   Her only other acting appearance with Falk was in a play called
``Knives,'' written by Falk's co-star in ``Mikey and Nicky,'' John
Cassavetes.
   ``John wrote three plays,'' she said. ``His wife, Gena Rowlands,
did one. Jon Voight did one. Peter and I did one. It was a serious
play about a marriage. It wasn't like `Who's Afraid of Virginia
Woolf?' Peter wasn't meek in this. The character was pretty
obnoxious. She wanted to be a singer or dancer or something. At the
end the stage goes black and you don't know if she committed
suicide or he killed her. When the curtain came up I was a lump on
the floor.''
   There is no recognition between them in ``Columbo,'' of course,
but Falk supposedly had a twinkle in his eye during a beach scene.
   ``Every time the director called `cut' you could hear Peter
going `Ha, ha, ha,''' she said. ``In a sauna scene my character was
drunk. Peter kept asking, `You sure you weren't drunk?' I said, `It
was six o'clock in the morning when we filmed it. I'm in a sauna
and they kept throwing cold water on me.'''
   Her CBS pilot ``Mulberry Street,'' which also stars Connie
Sellecca, Cesar Romero and Eddie Mekka, is about an Italian family
in New York.
   ``They changed my character after I was cast,'' she said. ``I
play Joanne, who's married to Eddie Mekka. The part was written for
a straight-laced Catholic girl who married when she was about 16.
She was prim and proper.
   ``I read the script and said they'd never pick me. But they cast
me and changed the part. Now, she has a line in the pilot, `I'd
shoot him with a stun gun and strap him to the hood of my car.'''
   Danese moved to Los Angeles in 1974. Her first role was on ``The
Bob Newhart Show.''
   ``I figured I'd be a big star within three weeks,'' she said.
``On the Newhart show I had two words. `Hi, honey.' I guess no one
else read it like I did. After that I did a lot of roles in movies
and on television. On `Family' I made two appearances as a
prostitute. I was usually a lingerie model or a cheap detective's
girlfriend. `Mulberry Street' is my first normal role in a
series.''

<HEAD>A Prescription For Medical Cost Ills</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In many a family's budget, one of the hardest
items to manage is the cost of medical care and other health
services.
   The bills that result from illness, injury or other misfortune
can quickly reach staggering heights. Often the outlays can't be
predicted or planned for, the way something like a child's college
tuition can.
   A patchwork of government and private health insurance programs
provides a cushion for some parts of the population, while leaving
others largely unprotected.
   Meanwhile, the cost the United States is paying as a society for
health care keeps climbing, consuming a greater and greater share
of its means to pay.
   All this adds up to a prescription for change, quite possibly
drastic change, in the 1990s, say the analysts who make up the
health care group in the research department of PaineWebber Inc.,
the large Wall Street firm.
   In fact, they contend, in the next few years Americans could
well find themselves moving toward a national health program along
the lines of those operated in Britain and Canada.
   ``The two primary factors driving this change will be the need
to rein in the system's cost on the one hand, and the need to
broaden its access on the other,'' says David Lothson, leader of
the PaineWebber group.
   ``These two objectives are obviously in conflict unless radical
changes are made in the health care system as we now know it.''
   As he presented his argument to a gathering of investment
managers early this week, Lothson conceded that a national health
system would be a tough idea to sell politically, opposed by
powerful interest groups and mistrusted by a significant part of
the general public.
   ``It's a hot potato no one wants to hold,'' he said.
   But before too many years have passed, he says, it is likely to
gain more and more attention as an answer to cost and equity
problems that will keep getting worse as long as they are left
unresolved.
   What form might such a setup take? The basics, Lothson suggests,
would include standard physician and hospital services available to
all. Other likely candidates would be prescription drugs for the
elderly and treatments such as kidney dialysis.
   Depending on what the nation wants and what Congress finds
politically possible, other possibilities could include long-term
care, dental and ophthalmic work, psychiatric hospital services and
drugs prescribed for patients under the age of 65.
   The whole idea would seem to fly in the face of recent trends in
this country, toward increased reliance on the private sector and
less emphasis on government programs.
   Certainly, creation of a vast new government apparatus faces
formidable obstacles at a time of chronic budget deficits. The
cost, one might fear, could be horrendous.
   Lothson concedes the validity, or at least the emotional force,
of most of these objections. However, he says, we are already
spending oceans of money on health care _ 12 percent of the
economy's gross output now, headed up to as much as 19 percent by
the year 2000.
   ``A fundamental problem with the U.S. health care system is that
it is, in effect, not a system at all,'' he observes.
   The evidence from other countries that have tried it, he adds,
strongly testifies that ``health care systems dominated by
government payers cost less.''
   Whatever the merits and drawbacks of a national plan, he adds,
doing nothing to change the current system is not an appealing
alternative.
   ``If growth of spending is not brought under control,'' he says,
``it will lower the nation's world competitive position and its
standard of living in the next decade.''

   Carl Hofmann has lost house, work, wife and
son.
   ``When a person gets down low, it's hard to get your feet back
above water,'' said Hofmann, 49, who suffers from depression and
stays in a Catholic Social Services residence for people who are
homeless and mentally ill.
   Then he met Social Security field representative James Keeler,
who helped him apply for federal disability benefits.
   ``He took a lot of time with me. I really appreciated that.''
   Hofmann and others like him are benefiting from a renewed effort
by the Social Security Administration to reach the homeless. The
orders came in April. Then-Commissioner Dorcas R. Hardy, fighting
to keep her job, directed employees to work more closely with
community and religious groups serving the homeless.
   Gwendolyn S. King, sworn in Aug. 1 as Hardy's successor, has
said she wants to expand programs to find homeless and needy people
who may not realize they are entitled to Social Security or
Supplemental Security Income benefits.
   Advocates for the homeless say the initiative is sorely needed,
but contend that at the same time Social Security has turned its
back on a program that could bring more homeless people into the
system.
   Part of the problem is that homeless people have no permanent
addresses and may have physical or mental problems that hinder
dealings with bureaucracy.
   ``A lot of the homeless people do not trust social service
agencies and, in particular, the federal government,'' said Gary
Van Scoy, assistant executive director for Catholic Social Services
in Scranton. ``Even though it might provide them a permanent source
of income, it takes a lot of convincing.''
   Many Social Security offices around the country have heeded
Hardy's call:
   _In Baltimore, a field representative roams streets to persuade
homeless people to apply for benefits, even taking applications on
park benches.
   _In Omaha, Neb., Social Security and the Eastern Nebraska Agency
on Aging set up a seminar to help community organizations identify
eligible people.
   _In Chula Vista, Calif., Social Security joined with other
social service providers to help people cope with the closing of
mobile-home parks due to land development. ``Those people were
really faced with homelessness,'' said Pamela B. Smith, district
manager. ``They had nowhere to go and no one to help them.''
   _Homeless coordinators have been appointed in all 151 field
offices in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, West
Virginia and the District of Columbia, said Dennis R. Conroy,
external affairs officer in Philadelphia.
   At a recent ``Help the Homeless'' seminar in Scranton, about 60
social workers, housing officials and others learned about Social
Security programs as well as training, mental health, drug abuse
and housing programs available under the Stewart B. McKinney
Homeless Assistance Act.
   The majority of homeless people, especially in cities, tend to
be men in their 20s to 30s, Conroy said. Social Security mostly
gets involved with those who are disabled, although it also can
help the elderly, who become homeless because they don't have
enough money to stay in a home.
   Supplemental Security Income is a federal program run by Social
Security for the needy aged, blind and disabled, but paid from
income taxes. The basic SSI payment is $368 a month for an
individual or $553 for a couple.
   All states but Arkansas, Georgia, Kansas, Mississippi,
Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia provide an optional supplement.
SSI eligibility also makes a person eligible for medical assistance
in all but Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Oklahoma,
Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Carolina, North
Dakota and Virginia.
   ``That to me is more valuable than the money,'' said Marion
Christmas, 53, a homeless Philadelphia man on SSI disability who
has gotten payments since he was set afire Nov. 10, 1985, while
asleep at a church construction site in Columbia, S.C. He was
severely burned and lost his left forearm.
   Hofmann, in Scranton, expects to hear within three to six months
whether he will get disability benefits. ``This is my fight to get
back on top. I really believe I'm going to get it.''
   Disability decisions average 78 days on initial claims, Conroy
said. The first level of appeal takes an average 60 more days. The
next stage, a decision by a Social Security administrative law
judge, takes an additional 210 days.
   ``I don't know anybody who got it the first time around,'' said
Sister Josephine McGrory of Mercy Hospice, a Philadelphia
residential program for mentally ill homeless women. Social
Security needs people who can come on short notice to the homeless
to do medical or psychological exams, she said.
   ``It is a big problem getting doctors to respond to requests,''
said Dolores Jefferson, an advocate in Philadelphia for the
Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare's Disability Advocacy
Program.
   ``We're talking about some rather bad areas,'' said Mary
Coleman, a supervisor in the advocacy program. ``We may be talking
about doctors having to do the interview on the street. Most
doctors aren't willing to do it.''
   Social Security also has had 17,000 employees dropped over the
past five years. Homeless advocates say greater reliance on
telephoned claims limit the face-to-face contact that might make or
break their eligibility determination.
   ``It sounds nice to write a memo exhorting Social Security to
make a special effort for the homeless, but it doesn't necessarily
result in any action,'' said Maria Foscarinis, director of the
Washington-based National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty.
   In fact, Hardy's April memo followed one in March 1988 urging
repeal of a program to help the homeless. Department of Health and
Human Services staffers warned in other memos against pushing for
repeal during an election year. The law center obtained the memos
under the Freedom of Information Act.
   The program, which has not been implemented, was authorized by
Congress in 1987 to help state and local governments set up teams
to identify homeless people potentially eligible for Social
Security benefits.
   Since obtaining the memos in August, the center has gotten
``only a pro forma response which says the Social Security
Administration has no intention of enforcing the program, but that
they're undertaking a whole series of other initiatives for the
homeless,'' Ms. Foscarinis said.
   Complicating the picture is debate on whether drug addiction or
alcoholism should be grounds for disability. SSA has contended it
could only be grounds in combination with another factor, such as
organ damage.
   But the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court ruled in 1983 and again in 1985
that alcoholism alone could be a compensable injury. U.S. District
Court Judge John B. Hannum ruled in August that Social Security
``systematically, continuously, willfully and almost scornfully
ignored'' the earlier rulings.
   Hannum ordered Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W.
Sullivan to reopen all disability claims denied since 1983 in
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware and the Virgin Islands and to
reevaluate them on the basis that alcoholism alone could be a
compensable injury. SSA has appealed.
   Meanwhile, education efforts like the program in Scranton will
continue, Conroy said. Social Security offices are compiling a
directory of agencies that provide services to the homeless and are
preparing audio tapes that can be used in shelters and residences
to explain available services. The agency also has tried to
streamline its application process and improved computer systems.
   Nonetheless, he said, ``I don't see this as a short-term type of
thing.''

   Sixty-nine-year-old Jeannie sits in a corner of
a public restroom where she spends her days, perched on a garbage
bag of belongings.
   Today her concern is her towel. ``I wasted two hours this
morning looking for that towel. I looked through that bag 10
times.''
   ``Did you look on the side? Sometimes things fall on the side
and you can't see it,'' said Patricia Betch, kneeling on the cement
floor.
   Betch, a Social Security field representative, has been trying
since spring to persuade the thin woman with fluffy white hair to
apply for benefits.
   Jeannie digresses, worried about the dead bird she found while
sleeping in the doorway of Broadway Market in the historic Fells
Point district.
   ``I think people leave their windows open a little bit. I think
they fly into some people's windows at night to sleep,'' Jeannie
said.
   ``That's what you'd like to do, isn't it Jeannie?'' asked Kathy
Lorenzo, a psychiatric outreach worker for Health Care for the
Homeless and Betch's partner. ``Why don't you let me find you a
room?''
   Jeannie refuses politely.
   Lorenzo and Betch leave, and Jeannie shouts a thank you for the
gifts she had avowed no need for: peanut butter-and-jelly
sandwiches, shirts, a jacket.
   ``You have to work so hard with these people to win their trust.
Jeannie is afraid she's signing admission papers'' for a mental
hospital, Betch said.
   The Social Security Administration has hit the streets in
Baltimore, seeking homeless people in alleys, restrooms and parks
under a new directive to reach out to the homeless. It's the only
SSA office with such a program.
   Lorenzo called Betch last spring to ask her to take an
application from a homeless person who wouldn't go into a building.
The two became a team, making their rounds each Wednesday,
distributing sandwiches, clothing and friendship.
   ``I decided to go out there because the need was so great.
Something had to be done here,'' Betch said, noting that 46 percent
of Maryland's 4,220 homeless live in Baltimore. Statewide, 2,200
shelter and transitional housing beds are available, leaving half
without a roof over their head at night.
   ``They're really afraid to go into any building. They've been
out on the street so long that that's more relaxing to them.''
   Betch set up an advisory board of officials from 18 agencies,
including shelters, soup kitchens, legal aid and the mayor's
office. Office hours are at the Baltimore Rescue Mission on
Wednesday evenings so people can find her.
   Mayor Kurt Schmoke wants a state worker to accompany Lorenzo and
Betch; many people who aren't eligible for Social Security will
qualify for welfare.
   If Lorenzo can persuade the homeless to visit her clinic and a
psychiatrist judges them unable to hold a job for at least a year,
they qualify for $368 in Supplemental Security Income, plus free
medical care. Conditions that qualify include alcoholism, mental
illness, drug addiction and physical disabilities.
   ``It's hard to prove a disability if you have no medical
records,'' Betch said. ``I'm not a (medical) professional but I can
tell they're sick.''
   Many are old enough to get Social Security retirement benefits,
requiring only proof of age and an address _ but many refuse to
apply.
   Since April, Betch has persuaded nine people to apply for
benefits, a figure she considers good. ``They'll take a sandwich
from you. They'll bid you good day, but until they know you ...
they have to want to file.''
   Six were denied and must reapply, she said.
   Walter is one of those Betch is trying to convince. A gentle man
with bright brown eyes, at 62 he qualifies for retirement benefits.
But he won't leave a square-block area that includes the Baltimore
Rescue Mission and the park square where he and about 10 other men
spend the day on benches.
   Since they began making their rounds in April, Betch said, some
shelters and soup kitchens have agreed to be mailing addresses.
Many agencies don't want to attract hoodlums and drug addicts who
prey on Social Security recipients and won't allow checks to be
mailed to them. But with an address, a homeless person can receive
the check and open a direct deposit account at a bank.
   As they part for the day, Lorenzo is plotting where she can find
a room for Jeannie for the winter. Betch says a congressional aide
has Jeannie's power of attorney; maybe the aide can sign the
application form.
   ``I'd hate to find her frozen to death,'' Lorenzo said. ``When
you're out on the street, that's your last bid. You either go up,
or you die.''

<HEAD>President of Catholic Bishops' Conference Exercised Quiet Diplomacy</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRIGGS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Peacemaker is the role Archbishop John L. May of
St. Louis envisioned for himself three years ago when he became
president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops.
   No wonder. In the fall of 1986, his predecessor, Bishop James
Malone of Youngstown, Ohio, was warning of a ``growing and
dangerous disaffection'' of American Catholics from the Holy See
and the bishops were in uproar over action taken against Seattle's
liberal Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen.
   As May prepares to leave office next week, he says he wants to
be remembered for helping develop ``a very strong understanding''
between the 53 million-member Roman Catholic Church in the United
States and the Vatican.
   ``There is a real growing understanding of American culture,
American ways, American experiences,'' May said in an interview.
``That helps us greatly that we don't waste our time in this
perceived difference, perceived dissension.''
   The low-key leadership exerted by the 67-year-old May is
credited in part for the new period of good will. Hunthausen, who
was stripped of some of his powers for opening churches to
homosexual worshipers and dispensing general absolution of sin to
large groups, has regained control of his archdiocese and the
Vatican has been generous in its praise of U.S. seminaries and
religious orders.
   Archbishop Daniel E. Pilarczyk of Cincinnati, vice president of
the bishops' conference, said May is ``unflappable, always
proceeding along and getting it done.''
   The Rev. Thomas J. Reese of Woodstock Theological Center at
Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., said May's
``non-threatening'' style was particularly helpful in Vatican
relations.
   ``He's a quiet, self-effacing kind of a guy. That kind of a
personality was very useful in dealing with Rome,'' said Reese,
author of ``Archbishop: Inside the Power Structure of the American
Catholic Church.''
   May credits much of the reduced tension to a series of meetings
between U.S. church leaders and Vatican officials and Pope John
Paul II's visit to the United States in 1987.
   What particularly impressed the pope on his U.S. visit, May
said, was the growing Hispanic presence in the church and the
religious vitality displayed at an ecumenical meeting with
fundamentalists, evangelicals and other Protestant religious
leaders in Columbia, S.C.
   ``The experience there eclipsed anything he's ever had in
ecumenical meetings,'' May said. ``He couldn't believe it.''
   May began his priesthood in 1947 as an assistant pastor of a
Chicago parish. He became auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of
Chicago in 1967 and was appointed bishop of the Diocese of Mobile,
Ala., in 1969. He was installed as archbishop of the Archdiocese of
St. Louis in 1980.
   Along with helping improve relations with the Vatican, the
moderate May also won praise for his ability to work with liberal
and conservative camps in the bishops' conference.
   ``He was someone who didn't have kind of a platform, didn't have
his own agenda he wanted to push,'' Reese said. ``He was as much a
follower as a leader.''
   Malone said May ``works with a quiet confidence.''
   ``I think he has been able to bring during his time a sure
leadership. I think he stood at the center, with an opening to the
left,'' Malone said.
   When a statement on AIDS from the bishops' administrative board
came under fire for giving conditional approval to condom education
in public schools, May agreed to have another committee of bishops
develop a second statement. That statement, which goes before the
conference at its fall meeting next week, makes no mention of
condoms, but May insists, ``The AIDS position we took previously is
still intact and has not been withdrawn.''
   When the Rev. George A. Stallings Jr. formed a separate
congregation for black Catholics in Washington earlier this year,
May acknowledged elements of racism in the church and told the
nation's estimated 2 million black Catholics, ``We need to
recognize more black leadership; our liturgies need more of the
vibrancy, and our policies more of the insight, of African
Americans.''
   As the abortion debate has heated up, the Catholic Church has
come under renewed criticism for its teachings, but May said the
bishops had no intention of backing down on their stance that ``an
unborn child cannot be killed for any purpose.''
   ``First of all, we believe that is our right as citizens of this
country and to be teachers of the Gospel to enter into these
discussions,'' May said.
   The right to participate in public debate without imposing
morality on others ``is the American concept,'' he said.

   Religious leaders attending a recent seminar on
health issues were urged to focus attention on the social problems
that keep blacks, Hispanics and other minorities from seeking
health care.
   ``In this country we find a pronounced and stubborn disparity
between the health status of minority Americans and the rest of
us,'' said Dr. James Mason, assistant secretary of the Department
of Health and Human Services. ``That disparity stands today as an
affront to American ideals.''
   Former U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop said churches must
work harder at their spiritual mission to be a compassionate buffer
between society and the sick but unwanted. Compassion for AIDS
victims tops the list, he said.
   ``The American people may not be inclined to be compassionate,''
he said. ``We have to break down barriers. Until we do that,
there's no point in calling ourselves a church.''

   Blacks in America are finding their advances
toward social, political and economic equality stalled by recent
Supreme Court decisions, the Executive Council of the United Church
of Christ contends.
   The 44-member body recently said the rulings have made it harder
for blacks to redress racial discrimination in the courts. It said
the 1.6 million-member church must ``declare by official action a
renewed determination to eliminate racism within church and
society.''
   The Executive Council acts on behalf of the church's main
deliberative body between biennial General Synod meetings.

   The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints should take some credit for Utah having the nation's highest
adoption rate and lowest abortion rate, the head of the National
Committee for Adoption says.
   ``Not only do the Mormons place a strong emphasis on family
values, but the state of Utah has a substantial number of very
good, professional social service agencies which are operated by
the church and whose services include adoptions,'' William Pierce
said in an interview with a church publication.
   There were 52 adoptions for every thousand abortions and
out-of-wedlock births in Utah in 1986, according to a church
release. The Utah abortion rate is 122 per 1,000 births, as
compared to 423 per 1,000 births for the nation.

   The eight seminaries of the Evangelical Lutheran
Church in America are facing a financial crisis and need a
coordinated effort to build their endowments, one seminary
president says.
   Roger W. Fjeld, president of Wartburg Theological Seminary in
Dubuque, Iowa, said four seminaries had deficits in the last school
year, and six project deficits for this school year.
   ``Those seminaries which experienced deficits in fiscal year
1988-89 used up nearly half of their reserves in order to meet
current expenses. The remaining reserves of those seminaries are
likely to be used in the current year,'' Fjeld said at a board
meeting of the church's Division for Ministry.

   The audience rose to its feet as
passionate Russian voices belted out ``God Bless America.'' The
Cold War seemed to thaw in the warmth of the accompanying
balalaikas.
   The Red Army has invaded the United States this year, but the
weapons are song and dance. For the first time since it was formed
61 years ago, the Red Army Song and Dance Ensemble is performing
for U.S. audiences.
   ``It took us too long to reach your country, a great country,''
said ballet dancer Nikita Tarasov, who recently performed with
other members of her group at the Memorial Coliseum. ``Our show
will show your people that our two countries can cooperate _ not
just the Soviet people, but the Soviet army. We can show your
people that we are peaceful, to say to Americans that nobody needs
war.''
   The 200-member ensemble, known as the Red Army Chorus, includes
Red Army members, former army members and some civilians.
   The group's performance began with the 90-member male chorus,
dressed in military uniforms, singing the national anthems of both
countries. The orchestra included balalaikas and other traditional
folk instruments.
   What followed was a succession of folk songs, Russian classical
music and colorful, energetic dance numbers. In ``Cossacks Cavalry
Dance,'' the performers waved sabers above their heads as they
danced across the small stage. Later, they performed the spirited
high leg kicks, spins and other gravity-defying moves associated
with Russian folk dance.
   Near the end, soloist Barseg Tumanyan sang, ``I've Got Plenty of
Nothin''' from ``Porgy and Bess.''
   In some of the more enthusiastic songs, a member of the chorus
or the band broke out in a frenzied whistle that brought cheers
from the audience.
   ``The language of music and ballet is universal,'' the
ensemble's director, Col. Anatoly Maltzev, said through an
interpreter in an interview.
   ``The people, the audiences, have been very warm,'' said
Tumanyan, who was a member of the ensemble in 1984-85 and is
performing on the U.S. tour as a guest. ``The last concert (in
Spokane, Wash.) was fantastic. You could feel it immediately.''
   Tumanyan, who has performed with several U.S. opera companies,
said talented singers, dancers and musicians can perform in the
ensemble instead of joining the regular army. In the Soviet Union,
all men must serve two years in the armed forces.
   ``Of course this is the best place for them to serve,'' he said.
``I don't know how to shoot a gun, so I served here. It was
wonderful.''
   Although the ensemble has performed in 40 countries, political
realities and international conflicts have prevented it from coming
to the United States.
   ``We were going to come to the United States in 1939,'' Maltzev
said. ``The ensemble was already in London on the way to the United
States, but the world war broke out.''
   After that, the tense relations between the two countries
prevented a rescheduling of the visit. This is the first time a
military band from the Soviet Union has come to the United States.
   ``The last year or two the relations between our countries have
improved, and that's probably one of the reasons we're here,''
Maltzev said. ``I would like to stress that it's not only relations
between the two governments, but it is also at the military level.
   ``We played with a (U.S.) military band in Seattle and Spokane.
That speaks for itself.''
   Tarasov, who describes himself as ``just a soldier,'' had never
been to the United States before, but he speaks fluent English.
   He has no doubt why the tour is finally taking place.
   ``It's because of perestroika, because of the home and foreign
policy of (Soviet leader) Mikhail Gorbachev,'' Tarasov said. ``It's
a great thing.''
   Portland was the 15th stop on a 31-city North American tour.
Most of the previous shows have been in Canada, although the
ensemble performed in New York, Chicago, Milwaukee and Minneapolis
before coming to the Northwest.
   Most of the grueling journey is being made by bus. The group
performed on a Tuesday in Seattle, then traveled 280 miles across
Washington for a show in Spokane on Wednesday night and 350 miles
to Portland for a Thursday night performance.
   ``We are tired, all of us,'' Tarasov said. ``It's too hard.''
   From Portland, the group headed across the Rockies to Colorado.
From there, they go to Arizona and California before returning to
the East for performances Nov. 16-19 at the Wang Center in Boston
and Nov. 20-26 at the Kennedy Center for Performing Arts in
Washington.
   Critics have called the show old-fashioned. Some have said the
dancers are far below the level of other Soviet performers, such as
the Kirov Ballet and Bolshoi Ballet. But American audiences have
loved what they've seen, giving the group standing ovations at
every show.
   The ensemble members say their trip to the United States is more
than just another tour.
   ``We think that it's important not just for our two countries,
but for the whole world,'' Maltzev said.

   They are among life's extras: parks and
flowers, the beach or golf course on a summer afternoon. But in one
county, such luxuries could end up casualties of the drug war.
   Fighting cocaine and other drug abuse is gobbling up more and
more local dollars nationwide, delaying purchases in some
communities, shifting funds in others and threatening everything
from government-supported leisure spots to pothole patching in
places such as Milwaukee County.
   ``The impacts of cocaine are so devastating that they're ripping
apart our entire county government,'' said Milwaukee County
Executive David Schulz.
   More must be spent now for social workers, jail space and staff,
he said, and that is forcing him to propose higher taxes, fewer
amenities and costlier services in the 1990 budget.
   Of the $913.5 million proposal, more than $100 million is for
continuing and new programs for drug and alcohol abuse, which
Schulz calls ``the single most driving force'' in his budget.
   ``It permeates the entire fabric of the community,'' said Sylvan
Leabman, county fiscal and budget administrator.
   If the budget is adopted on Nov. 14, ``it will take longer for
the county to complete highway maintenance,'' he said. ``The grass
won't be mowed as often. The flowers won't be as nice. ... Services
won't be as extensive. Things will cost more. The waiting lines
will be longer.''
   ``If you spend $1 million more at our prison, that's $1 million
you don't have to spend on quality of life services,'' Leabman
added. ``It's a tradeoff. In this particular budget, the tradeoff
appears to be very stark.''
   Schulz has proposed three pools be closed, six bus routes, a law
library and lifeguards at two Lake Michigan beaches be eliminated,
golf, marina, stadium parking and other fees be raised, staff cuts
be made at the parks, museum and zoo and some people be charged for
paramedic services.
   ``It's very difficult,'' said Brigid Sullivan, head of the
parks, recreation and culture department. ``There are personal as
well as communitywide impacts.''
   The proposal has come under attack, with residents criticizing
Schulz at two public hearings and some elected officials arguing
that the plan demands too much of the county in fighting drugs.
Indeed, competition for dollars is more intense here than elsewhere
because the county runs services, such as the museum and zoo, often
operated by cities.
   But, Schulz said, ``every city in the country faces the same
basic dilemma.''
   ``This is not unlike a `guns and butter' issue,'' said James
Fyfe, justice professor at American University in Washington, D.C.
``The old political credo is you can't have both. If you're going
to fight a domestic war, you have to give up a lot of programs and
services people are accustomed to. You can't put cops out to direct
traffic when three blocks down the road people are selling crack.''
   Many communities face competing pressures. For example:
   _In Alexandria, Va., Mayor James Moran said the drug problem
``affects your ability to respond to other community needs. It
hampers us severely. I'd like to improve our education curriculum .
.. purchase more open space, build a library, improve our public
transportation.''
   And yet ``our foremost emphasis almost to the distraction of
everything else had been dealing with drugs,'' he said, noting the
police budget has moved from the fifth- to second-highest
expenditure in three years. Only education is higher.
   _In Hennepin County, Minn., home of Minneapolis, child welfare
placement costs, largely tied to parents' cocaine and crack abuse,
rose from $21 million in 1987 to a projected $30 million in 1990 _
a 45 percent increase, officials say.
   ``There's no question we're going to have to cut less acute
programs,'' said County Board Chairman Jeff Spartz. Day care and
mental health programs could be scaled back because, he said,
strict levy limitations bind the county.
   _In California, state Attorney General John Van de Kamp has
proposed in his gubernatorial campaign platform an anti-drug
superfund _ to be approved in a referendum _ that would distribute
$1.7 billion over eight years.
   _In Jackson County, Mo., which includes part of Kansas City,
voters will be asked Tuesday to approve a sales tax of a quarter of
1 percent to be used strictly to fight drugs through enforcement,
rehabilitation and prevention.
   ``It gives us an opportunity to fight back, to do something
aggressive,'' said Prosecutor Albert Riederer, who said the tax
would be collected for seven years, generating about $14 million
annually.
   Milwaukee County officials are seeking a 15.9 percent increase
in the property tax rate and a 0.5 percent sales tax, expected to
raise about $49 million. About a quarter o that is directly due to
drugs or alcohol, Schulz said.
   Substance abuse ``causes us problems in corrections, causes us
to spend money in courts ... law enforcement ... and in child
abuse, child neglect and cocaine babies,'' Schulz said. ``It's
really the indirect effects.''
   Milwaukee's murder rate topped 100 by the end of October,
surpassing 1987's yearlong record of 95. In 1988, 51 percent of
murder victims tested positive for cocaine.
   And the House of Corrections population _ those imprisoned for a
year or less _ jumped from 850 to more than 1,300 in two years;
Schulz says up to two-thirds are substance abusers.
   Schulz wants to build a dormitory for that increasing
population. Ground also is being broken for a new jail to hold
inmates awaiting trial. And he is seeking to add more than 100
workers in corrections and social services.
   Child abuse and neglect referrals have tripled in the last 5{
years, officials say. Again, drugs play a big role.
   Despite the serious situation, County Board Supervisor Thomas
Meaux said, ``It's totally unrealistic to expect the means of
county government to solve the drug problem.'' He accused Schulz of
using it as ``a convenient excuse to justify his budget.''
   ``Traditionally the viewpoint is we're the government of last
resort,'' Meaux said. ``This is one time we can't afford to accept
that posture. ... We ought not to be stripping quality of life
programs.''
   Officials hope for help from federal anti-drug allocations, but
no one knows yet how much may reach Milwaukee County. ``We're doing
all our homework so we can utilize that money to the best of our
ability,'' said Pat Mueller, an aide to Schulz.
   Meanwhile, said Schulz, it's a balancing act.
   The county must not cut so much that it sacrifices ``investment
in our future.''
   But, he added, ``You've got to feed the people in the House of
Corrections. You've got to run the courts. You don't have to
operate the parks, the museum and the zoo and subsidize the
performing arts.''
   ``No one's happy about it,'' said Leabman, the budget
administrator. ``It's a very, very tough price.''

   Are neon lights windows to the soul? Can
billboards evoke the Renaissance?
   Imagine shampoo ads hanging in the Louvre, newspaper headlines
in the National Gallery, television sets at the Metropolitan Museum
of Art.
   Advertising and Art. Soup cans and the Mona Lisa. Billboards and
Michelangelo. Cable and Cubists.
   Visual images _ magazines, television, film _ have forced
artists to acknowledge the enormous volume of information
transmitted each day and incorporate it in their work.
   From Nov. 9 through Feb. 18, the Whitney Museum of American Art
will present ``Image World: Art and Media Culture,'' a wide-ranging
exhibit of art and artifacts from the past 30 years, including
posters, magazine montages and a stamp machine.
   In a world where everything, even art, is for sale, ``Image
World'' shows how commerce can be turned into art. So get ready to
appreciate the aesthetic beauty of the five-day forecast, gaze at
lovingly drawn portraits of surveillance cameras and analyze
electronic transfers of Elvis.
   ``There's no way walking through the streets of New York one can
avoid this visual culture of these popular images,'' said John G.
Hanhardt, the Whitney curator who organized the show. ``You can't
even avoid television if you don't watch it. It influences the way
people dress, what they buy, how they talk.''
   In the last 300 years, has anyone made a greater impact on art
than Volney B. Palmer? Who? Why the founder of the first
advertising agency, of course, back in 1841. What about William
Henry Fox Talbot, who that same year patented the calotype, a paper
negative capable of producing multiple copies?
   And don't forget Earnest Elmo Colkins, who in 1890 promoted the
concept of art direction in advertisements, or Walter Dill Scott,
author of the 1908 book, ``The Psychology of Advertising,'' which
urged the incorporation of emotional and motivational techniques
into the selling of products.
   Starting in the late 1950s, Nam June Paik, Andy Warhol, James
Rosenquist, Roy Lichtenstein and other artists attacked the
onslaught of product and imagery, taking recognizable objects and
placing them within the structure of the art world. That meant
glossy portraits of cigarette ads, a television set coated in
cement or a lifesize porcelain sculpture of Michael Jackson and his
chimpanzee.
   ``The show kind of tracks that response,'' said guest curator
Marvin Heiferman. ``You get a Warhol and wonder if it's critical or
celebratory. You have a picture of an electric chair or Elvis
Presley. Is he the `King' or some tragic heroic figure? There's an
enthusiasm and brashness which you didn't see before.''
   Media began creeping into art around 1912 when Braque and
Picasso used newspaper bits in their Cubist collages. A few years
later, Marcel Duchamp began appropriating actual consumer objects,
such as a paint advertisement, into his art.
   The works of Berlin Dadaists John Heartfield and Raoul Hausmann
consisted entirely of images cut from newspapers and magazines.
Surrealist Salvador Dali directed segments of Hollywood movies,
appeared in commercial advertisements and created ``Dali's Dream
House'' specially for the 1939 World's Fair.
   Also in 1939, Hollywood's most artistic and productive year ever
headlined by ``Gone With the Wind,'' an essay by art critic Clement
Greenberg, ``Avant-garde and Kitsch,'' warned that synthetic art
had become ``an integral part of our productive system in a way in
which true culture could never be,'' and that its ``enormous
profits are a source of temptation to the avant-garde itself.''
   With the proliferation of television after World War II, cereal
and toothpaste were being beamed into millions of homes every day.
Philip Morris cigarettes were smoked on ``I Love Lucy,'' quality
theater was presented by General Electric and John Cameron Swayze
was host for the ``Camel News Caravan.''
   ``Pop Art'' was the response, an attempt to inject ``truth'' in
advertising. It was created, ironically, by artists who had once
worked in the advertising world. Warhol designed shoe posters;
Rosenquist painted billboards in Times Square.
   ``I was struck by the numbness I felt by painting images like
huge noses and huge eyes,'' Rosenquist recalled.
   ``Eyes three feet wide. Noses 10 feet long. Very large imagery.
I couldn't focus on the image although I was mixing the color
accurately. I made paintings where I placed objects in the picture
plane in different scales, and where the largest and closest image
would be the most difficult to identify.''
   Movies were big when Paik was growing up in Korea, and Shirley
Temple was the most famous person in his country in 1937. He saw
television for the first time in the early 1950s and was working on
electronic music a decade later in Cologne, West Germany, when the
``idiot box'' inspired a stroke of genius.
   ``I was at an impasse, a dead end,'' the artist recalled. ``So I
thought I would rather create electronic pictures than electronic
music. There were electronic music composers but no electronic
picture composers.
   ``I bought 13 old TV sets in Germany and changed the insides of
them. Then I showed them in German galleries and got a very big
reception.''
   Technology. It's everywhere, and Pop Artists consumed it. Thanks
to the portable movie camera, one didn't have to be a Hollywood
director to make movies. Thanks to the silkscreen, a picture could
be lifted off a newspaper and duplicated on canvas.
   Anything can now be turned into art: manhole covers, toilets,
subway signs. At the ``Image World'' exhibit, even the ticket booth
can't be trusted. Dennis Adams, best known for his designs of bus
shelters, has put together a special construction.
   ``It's the idea of a ticket booth, using images of homelessness
instead,'' he said. ``There are photographic images that create the
walls of the ticket booth _ large photographic images _ and you'll
be paying through the slot in the photograph.
   ``I love those structures. They bring capitalism to its most
basic level, a small window with money being exchanged.''
   With originals by Warhol and Rosenquist now worth millions of
dollars, Adams sees his work as returning to the very idea of Pop,
making art accessible to the public, using everyday objects and
presenting them in a different way.
   ``Very simply, my work deals with the idea of taking a
functional structure that everyone recognizes and using that as a
kind of instrument for getting to another agenda,'' Adams said.
``The functional element is just a kind of decoy, a way of making a
viewer feel comfortable.''
   In an age of jumbotrons, space shuttles and photo opportunities,
the possibilities for art are limitless. Rosenquist talked of
projects involving electronic nymphs in space and particles of
nuclear ashes.
   It may all seem, literally, a million miles away from the
Sistine Chapel, but Rosenquist insists art and communication have
always been linked.
   ``You go back to the gossip of the Renaissance paintings,'' he
said. ``Later on, printing started, and hand-in-hand with art,
communication changed.''

   Judith Krantz, whose five best-selling novels
became miniseries, says the essential element for success is
creating strong female characters.
   ``Till We Meet Again,'' which will be telecast in two parts on
CBS Sunday and Tuesday, has three strong women who come through
heroically.
   Krantz emphasizes the women in her books are ``female heroes,''
not heroines.
   ``The term heroine, it seems to me, implies something
Victorian,'' she said. ``It brings up an image of a woman who
faints in the hero's arms.''
   She emphasizes that her books are peopled with strong men as
well.
   ``I can't forget the men because without the men the women
wouldn't lead interesting lives,'' Krantz said. ``But the women are
the focus of my books. I feel I understand men and can write about
them. The essential element that is the heart of my books is strong
women who succeed at an enterprise. I couldn't possibly write a
book without strong women.''
   ``Till We Meet Again'' stars Courtney Cox, Mia Sara and Lucy
Gutteridge as the women of resilience and fortitude. It also stars
Michael York, Bruce Boxleitner, Barry Bostwick, Hugh Grant, Charles
Shaughnessy, Maxwell Caulfield, John Vickery, Denis Arndt and
Juliet Mills.
   The family saga spans the period from before World War I to
after World War II and is set in France, England and the United
States.
   Eve (Lucy Gutteridge) becomes a star of the Paris music halls,
entertains troops at the front and marries a diplomat who is heir
to one of France's great champagne dynasties.
   Daughter Delphine (Mia Sara) becomes a major international movie
star. Daughter Freddy (Courtney Cox) becomes a Hollywood stunt
pilot and in World War II ferries planes to the Royal Air Force.
   Krantz's first book was ``Scruples,'' which CBS telecast in
1980. It inspired a sequel movie on ABC the next year that was a
series pilot. It was followed by ``Princess Daisy,'' ``Mistral's
Daughter'' and ``I'll Take Manhattan.''
   Krantz, who was born in New York, was a magazine writer and
fashion editor before her husband encouraged her to write
``Scruples.'' In her books she has used that background, plus her
years living in Paris, to conjure up worlds of glamour and
excitement.
   She wrote her first four books on a battered electric portable
typewriter. ``Till We Meet Again'' was the first book she wrote on
a word processor. She is careful to back up her work on memory
disks and also make a printout of everything regularly. Now, she
says she could never work on a typewriter again.
   ``I work at home in old clothes,'' she said. ``I get very
comfortable and I pile on sweaters. When things are going well I
can do five pages a day. Writing is a lot like being an athlete.
You have winning streaks, you have slumps and every day you start
anew.
   ``I haven't had a losing streak, but I've had slumps in the
course of writing a book. I'll have periods of pulling my hair over
how to write a scene. Then, suddenly, I'll see it and write it in
two days. I can always tell when I'm writing well. I start warming
up and have to peel off my sweaters.''
   Krantz, acknowledging some superstition, said she doesn't like
to analyze why she's had five hits in a row.
   ``I feel I'm like a typical reader and I write to please
myself,'' she said. ``I never allow anyone except my husband to see
a book until it's completely finished.''
   The author's husband, Steve Krantz, produced the ``Till We Meet
Again'' miniseries, which was adapted by Andrew Peter Marin and
directed by Charles Jarrott.
   Her husband is a motion picture and television producer who's
written two novels on his own.
   ``A miniseries is a collaborative effort,'' she said. ``With a
book it's just me. Nobody tells me what to write or how to write. I
submit an outline to my publisher, but then I may change it because
new things occur to you as you write. When it's adapted as a
miniseries I read the script very carefully. If there's anything I
don't think is right I let them know.
   ``I also have a hand in the casting. An actor may be cast who
gives a character a different look. An actor always personalizes a
role and makes it his own. That can change the way I visualized a
character. My husband makes an enormous effort to stay true to the
spirit of my books.''

   The Bush administration has reached agreement
with House leaders on a plan to raise the minimum wage gradually to
$4.25 an hour by April 1991, the first increase since 1981.
   The agreement Tuesday for a 90-cent-an-hour hike over the next
17 months also provides for an unprecedented subminimum ``training
wage'' that could be paid to teen-agers with little work
experience. It would be pegged at 85 percent of the prevailling
minimum wage.
   The House is expected to vote this week on the compromise,
designed to end a lengthy and often bitterly partisan battle.

   New home sales took their steepest dive in
nearly eight years last month while the government's chief economic
forecasting gauge registered only a small increase, the government
reported.
   The Commerce Department's Index of Leading Indicators, designed
to foretell economic activity six to nine months in advance, inched
up 0.2 percent in September.
   At the same time, the department reported Tuesday that new home
sales dropped 14 percent, the sharpest decrease since a 19 percent
decline in January 1982 during the last recession.

   Georgia-Pacific Corp. has offered to buy
Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. for about $3.13 billion, triggering
speculation about a bidding war for the maker of paper products,
lumber and plywood.
   Great Northern's stock price leaped nearly 50 percent Tuesday,
exceeding Georgia-Pacific's offering price.
   The deal would place 10 million acres of timberland, 64,000

<HEAD>Owners of Norelco Water Cleaner Eligible for Refunds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some owners of a popular water cleaning
machine are entitled to refunds because the appliance actually
added a harmful chemical to drinking water, the Federal Trade
Commission said.
   The agency said Tuesday that consumers who bought the Norelco
Clean Water Machine and replacement filters for them are eligible
for a full refund under a recent settlement agreement reached with
the manufacturer.
   The commission last year charged Norelco with false advertising
in its claims that the Clean Water Machine removed harmful
chemicals from drinking water because the unit actually added
methylene chloride, a potentially hazardous chemical, into water
passing through the machine.
   The commission said methylene chloride, a volatile organic
industrial solvent, was used to glue together filters for the
machines that were marketed from 1982 to 1986. As water passed
through the machines the methylene chloride leached into the water,
the agency said.
   North American Philips Corp., Norelco's parent, has agreed to
provide $2.5 million to pay customer refunds.
   Consumers must submit refund applications no later than Dec. 31,
1989. The forms and additional information are available from:

<HEAD>Shearson Ends Index Arbitrage for Clients; Backs Higher Index Futures

   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. is calling for
increasing the amount of borrowed money needed to buy stock-index
futures in an effort to curb computerized program trading, which is
being blamed for market turmoil.
   Shearson, the nation's second-largest retail brokerage, called
for the reform Tuesday after joining an exodus of big Wall Street
firms by abandoning index arbitrage trading for clients.
   ``It has become increasingly clear since the afternoon of Oct.
13 that volatility is damaging the fianancial markets and the
ability of corporate America to raise capital efficiently,''
Shearson said in a statement.
   The Dow Jones industrial average plunged more than 190 points in
a few hours on Oct. 13. Many market professionals blamed the
rapidity of the decline on computerized program trading strategies.
   Meanwhile Tuesday, John J. Phelan Jr., the chairman of the New
York Stock Exchange, said the exchange plans to re-examine its
rules on trading halts during wild price swings in the market.
   Phelan said the trading halts, called circuit breakers, may not
be adequate. He told The New York Times that the exchange may
consider circuit breakers that would halt trading in the futures
markets in Chicago as well as at the Big Board in New York. The
exchange's board is scheduled to meet Thursday.
   In an interview with The Washington Post, Phelan warned that the
market could be ruined if it does not check the price swings.
   ``If it keeps up long enough, it is going to destroy the markets
as a capital-raising mechanism, much less as a place where people
can invest intelligently,'' Phelan said.
   ``A lot of people think it is a a New York Stock Exchange
issue,'' he told the Post. ``It is a national issue _ liquidity in
all markets and volatility in all markets. It affects individual
investors because they get frightened to death of this volatility
that is there, and we don't blame them.''
   Six other Wall Street firms have said in the last week they
would abandon program trading for some or all of their accounts.
Shearson stopped index arbitrage trading for its own account in
January 1988.
   Shearson called for ``consistent margins'' on stocks and
stock-index futures in an attempt to reduce the rapid trading of
futures believed to spur trading in stocks.
   Federal regulations limit the amount of borrowed money used to
buy stocks to 50 percent, while investors may play stock index
futures with only a 10 percent deposit.
   Index abitrage involves sophisticated computer programs that
seek to capitalize on brief and minute differences in the prices of
stocks and stock-index futures by simultaneously buying or selling
stocks with opposite trades in the futures.
   Stock-index futures are contracts to buy or sell baskets of
stocks based on particular indexes, such as the Standard &amp; Poor's
500 index.
   Critics of program trading maintain that index arbitrage can
speed declines in stocks by flooding the market with sell orders,
encouraging waves of panic selling. The strategy was blamed for
worsening the October 1987 market crash.
   Many firms backed away from program trading after the crash but
returned gradually as the market stabilized.
   Like other firms, Sheason indicated it does not believe program
trading alone is responsible for recent rapid market movements,
saying that ``economic fundamentals will ultimately determine the
direction of stock prices over the long term.''
   But Shearson said it supported a series of changes aimed at
helping to ``minimize sudden, destructive moves in the market.''
   Shearson, a subsidiary of American Express, accounted for just
2.2 percent of all index arbitrage on the New York Stock Exchange
in September, trading a total of 11.5 million shares via computer
program strategies.
   The firm also said it supported restricting or eliminating
electronic access to the NYSE for program traders during volatile
periods and consolidating all stocks and derivative products under
a single regulatory body.
   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., the largest retail brokerage, said Monday
it would halt so-called index arbitrage for clients until the stock
market calms down. Paine Webber Group Inc. took a similar step last
week.
   Kidder Peabody &amp; Co. said Monday it would execute index
arbitrage trades only for clients, not for its own account. Morgan
Stanley &amp; Co. Inc., Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. and Oppenheimer &amp; Co. made
similar announcements last week.

<HEAD>Mitsubishi Wary of Trade Issues in Buying Rockefeller Center Stake</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARI YAMAGUCHI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mitsubishi Estate Co., which is buying a
controlling stake in the company that owns Rockefeller Center, says
it wants to be a good corporate citizen and will do nothing to add
to frictions over the purchase.
   ``Americans might feel as if they were being invaded by
Japanese, especially because they have special feelings toward
Rockefeller Center, which has been a landmark in New York,''
acknowledged Kiyoaki Hara, Mitsubishi's managing director.
   The Japanese company is paying $846 million to buy a 51 percent
stake in Rockefeller Group Inc. Rockefeller Group's most famous
asset is the 22-acre Manhattan development, with its skating rink,
annual Christmas tree, Radio City Music Hall and office towers.
   The purchase, announced Monday, comes a few weeks after Sony
Corp. agreed to buy Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. for $3.4
billion, another deal that stirred concerns over rising Japanese
investment in the United States.
   Indeed, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., waxed political about
the deal on the Senate floor Tuesday in Washington.
   ``This year when they turn on the lights to that Christmas tree
in Rockefeller Center, we Americans are going to have to come to
grips with the reality that that great national celebration is
actually occurring on Japanese property,'' Lieberman said.
   The older 12-building Art Deco portion of Rockefeller Center,
including Radio City Music Hall, most likely will not be controlled
by Mitsubishi past the year 2000. That property is under a $1.3
billion convertible mortgage. The mortgage owners, a real estate
investment trust, have the right to convert their holding into a
71.5 percent ownership of of the property after 2000.
   After the expected conversion, Rockefeller Group would own only
28.5 percent, with Mitsubishi owning 51 percent of that, or about
14 percent.
   For Mitsubishi, the more valuable assets are the Time-Life
Building and a 50 percent interest in the McGraw-Hill Building,
which are in the newer portion of Rockefeller Center; as well as
Rockefeller Group's nationwide Cushman &amp; Wakefield commercial real
estate brokerage and prime real estate parcels in New York and New
Jersey.
   Mitsubishi Estate, one of the related Mitsubishi companies
involved in everything from cars and banking to shipbuilding and
home electronics, said in a statement it did not plan to send
executives to join in Rockefeller Group management, which will
continue to manage Rockefeller Center.
   Mitsubishi Estate, which was established in the 1890s, is
Japan's second-largest real estate company, with sales of $1.9
billion in fiscal 1988. The largest, Mitsui Real Estate Development
Co., had sales of $5.9 billion in the last fiscal year.
   Hara said the deal would enable Mitsubishi, trailing in overseas
real estate business, to catch up with its rivals, Sumitomo and
Mitsui, which also have made major inroads into U.S. commercial
real estate.
   Rockefeller Group has been controlled by a family whose name
stands for American capitalism. The trusts that manage the family's
interests said they sold their majority stake in the company to
diversify its holdings.
   Richard Voell, president and chief executive officer of
Rockefeller Group, issued a statement saying the purchase by
Mitsubishi would ``enhance the financial strength of RGI. It
ensures the company's ability to continue to invest in Rockefeller
Center to enhance its stature as the most modern and prestigious
commercial complex.''
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe told reporters that
buyouts become controversial only when Japanese are involved.
   ``When British, Dutch and other European countries have been
engaged in similar acts, no particular attention was given to that.
... People have to look over these differences of nationality and
cultural background to see if it is truly an acceptable transaction
in accordance with normal standards of economic transactions,''
Watanabe said.

   Democrats on a joint congressional committee
have criticized the Bush administration for scheduling further
conferences on job training rather than proposing specific
legislation.
   ``It's ridiculous that we have to re-invent the wheel like this
every year,'' Rep. James H. Scheuer of New York told Assistant
Secretary of Labor Roberts Jones.
   Scheuer said Tuesday the problem has been so well studied that
all Jones would have to do is sit down with previous administration
officials for an hour over lunch.
   Such a meeting could produce a good program, ``and you won't
have to wait until next spring,'' said Scheuer. ``Why can't you hit
the deck running?'' he asked.
   Jones was the administration's witness at a hearing of the Joint
Economic Committee, headed by Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., which
met to explore the growing gap between work skills and the needs of
employers.
   Gore chided the administration for ``a lack of precision in
connection with what needs to be done'' to make sure that workers
have the mental skills for jobs in a more complex service economy.
   Jones, the top department official for employment and training,
told the committee that the department next spring will convene ``a
national conference of employers, unions, educators and training
professionals.''
   Jones cited in his testimony the need for programs emphasizing
the the transition from school to work, including young people who
go directly from high school to jobs.
   He said the spring conference has many of the officials
mentioned by Gore and Scheuer and added: ``I don't think the
solutions come in any instant legislative package ... It's going to
happen with a fundamental change in the education system.''
   He said those changes have to originate with the setting of
educational norms at the state and local level.
   Gore and Scheuer pressed Jones to make a commitment to full
financing for the Head Start preschool training program, which the
two said has proven its effectiveness beyond a doubt.
   But Jones said it would be ``irresponsible'' to make a
commitment. ``It's got to be balanced in the context of other
programs.''

   U.S. manufacturing companies believe the
country will enjoy moderate economic growth and no recession for at
least a year, according to a survey by an industry trade group.
   The National Association of Manufacturers said Tuesday that its
survey of 53 chief executives at U.S. companies found that 61
percent of them believe the next recession will not start until
1991 or later.
   While some economists are concerned about recent signs of
weakness in the manufacturing sector, NAM President Jerry
Jasinowski said those fears were not evident in the association's
latest survey of its board of directors.
   ``It is significant that manufacturers, who know first hand the
magnitude of the competitive challenges, are fundamentally
optimistic about the future,'' Jasinowski told reporters at a
briefing.
   Jasinowski predicted that economic growth would be supported
next year by increases of around 4 percent in business investment
spending and a further modest improvement in the U.S. trade deficit
of around $10 billion to $15 billion.
   The merchandise trade deficit has been running at an annual rate
of $110 billion so far this year, down from a $120 billion deficit
in 1988.
   Jasinowski said the main fear among the executives about the
economy's future centered in the automotive sector, where sales
have been lackluster so far in the new model year.
   ``A dramatic drop in sales of autos and other big-ticket
products because the consumer bailed out is about the only way I
see a recession occuring next year,'' he said.
   Jasinowski said he did not look for this to occur, predicting
instead that consumer spending would advance modestly in 1990.
   NAM, which has 13,500 members, represents companies accounting
for 85 percent of the nation's manufacturing jobs.

<TEXT>
   Farhad Azima, founder of the now-defunct
Global International Airways Corp. of Kansas City, said Tuesday he
was investigating the possibility of buying troubled Braniff Inc.
   Azima said that if he was successful, the airline could operate
60 to 80 flights a day from Kansas City, its main hub, to about 30
cities.
   Braniff, based in Orlando, Fla., was operating 93 daily flights
from Kansas City International Airport when it filed for Chapter 11
Bankruptcy Court protection from its creditors in late September.
It now has 20 daily flights from the airport.
   Azima told the Kansas City Times he had discussed the prospect
of buying Braniff, or part of it, with several Kansas City
businessmen. However, Azima said, other investors would not be
essential.
   Azima's effort is separate from that of John Latshaw, a longtime
Kansas City securities executive who has discussed pooling money
from area investors to buy Braniff.
   Azima said he owns a Kansas City aircraft leasing company,
Aviation Leasing Group, that also operates in the Caribbean and
Europe. Azima also has a small airline called Buffalo Airways based
in Waco, Texas, that hauls cargo.
   He said he had retained Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. to place a
value on Braniff or at least part of it.
   Azima was president of Global International Airways, a Kansas
City company that became one of the country's biggest air cargo and
passenger charter carriers before running into financial trouble.
   Global International sought to reorganize under Chapter 11 of
the bankruptcy laws in 1983 but later was forced to liquidate.
   In 1986, the Federal Aviation Administration's records showed
that a plane owned by Azima was linked to an arms shipment to Iran.
An attorney for Global International responded at that time that
Azima had leased the plane to another company and had no knowledge
of how the plane had been used. No charges against Azima resulted.

   Steel workers at Timken Co. ratified a
four-year contract Tuesday, ending a 5{-week strike over wages and

   Timken spokesman Jim Mulder said the agreement gives employees
an immediate 43-cent-an-hour cost-of-living adjustment that will be
added to the average base wage of $11.83 an hour, plus an hourly
raise of 25 cents. The agreement includes a 25-cent hourly increase

in 1992, Mulder said.
   Workers with more than 30 years at the company will be
guaranteed a minimum pension payment of $1,000 a month when they
retire, Mulder said. He said employees will start returning to work
Wednesday.
   Mary Walker, a spokeswoman for United Steelworkers Local 1123 in
Canton, said the estimated vote by union members at Timken plants
in Canton, Columbus and Wooster was 2,300 in favor of the contract
to 1,600 against.
   About 5,400 workers went on strike Sept. 25 over pension
benefits and pay after rejecting the company's four-year contract
proposal.
   The company makes alloy steel bars, tubes and bearings for the
automotive, railroad and construction industries.

<HEAD>Reebok Plans $15 Million Ad Blitz for Pump Basketball Shoe Introduction</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Reebok International plans to pump $15 million
into advertising its new inflatable basketball shoe that the
sneaker maker hopes will make the company a bigger force on the
court _ as well as off it.
   Reebok executives said the eight-month ad blitz for their new
shoe, called The Pump, makes it the largest product introduction
ever in the footwear industry.
   But Reebok's main competitor, Nike Inc., said it already is
shipping similar shoes called Nike Air Pressure to retailers
without creating a splashy and expensive ad campaign.
   Nike spokeswoman Elizabeth Dolan said the Beaverton, Ore.-based
company has always had a reputation for technological innovation,
and sniffed, ``We don't have to stake the whole farm on one shoe.''
   No matter what else they are, these shoes are expensive _
Reebok's cost $170 a pair and Nike's go for $175.
   Securities analysts said Reebok may be looking for a
high-profile way to let people know it is going after people more
interested in performance than fashion. The company has had more of
a reputation as a trend innovator than as a maker of serious
athletic shoes.
   ``The actual percentage of the market that would need a shoe
like this is fairly small,'' said Elizabeth Armstrong, who follows
sneaker makers for the investment firm Prescott Ball &amp; Turben.
   She said Reebok, based in Canton, Mass., may be hoping the
attention it gets for this top-end basketball shoe will help
``sales of the shoes below it.''
   Nike is the leader in basketball shoes, selling $414 million
worth last year, according to the Nike spokeswoman.
   Frank O'Connell, president of Reebok North America, said
basketball shoes accounted for $300 million of Reebok's $1.3
billion in domestic sales last year.
   Atlanta Hawks basketball star Dominique Wilkins was on hand
Tuesday for the introduction of The Pump at a news conference on
the basketball court at Hunter College in Manhattan.
   Wilkins and NBA players Byron Scott, Danny Ainge, Dennis Johnson
and Doc Rivers, and coaches Pat Riley of the Los Angeles Lakers and
Digger Phelps of Notre Dame, appear in ads debuting later this
month in which they describe in unrehearsed and often humorous
style how the shoes work.
   ``Some people like BMW's; I like gym shoes,'' Rivers said in one
ad.
   The high-top shoes have an orange button on the tongue that can
be pressed to pump air into a specially-designed plastic bladder,
forming a readily-adjusted cushion around the ankle, heel and
instep to support the foot and protect it against the damaging
effects of jarring, sudden moves.
   Air is released by depressing a separate valve on the collar of
the shoe.
   Wilkins told the news conference the inflatable shoes give him
support and let him skip taping his ankles as he must with other
shoes before playing.
   The Nike Air Pressure shoes use a different technology to create
an air collar around the ankle of the shoe and are inflated with a
small plastic hand pump.
   Ms. Dolan said that while a separate pump may not be convenient,
Nike's tests showed an internal pump system could not withstand the
beating shoes take in tournament-style play.
   But Nike may be turning the separate pump to its advantage. It
sells the shoes and the pump in a special carrying case that could
connote status.
   Ms. Dolan said the case emphasizes that the shoes are made for
serious basketball players. ``They wear their regular shoes to the
court and change to their basketball shoes,'' she said.

   U.S. Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan has
asked independent oil producers to help develop a national energy
plan and said that the oil industry must consider the environment
to move forward.
   ``Over the next few months, I want to invite you to give us your
comments and suggestions on how America can move towards a brighter
energy future,'' Lujan said Tuesday. ``I challenge you to bring
creative, innovative suggestions.''
   Lujan, speaking to the Independent Petroleum Association of
America, said the Department of the Interior is working with the
Energy Department on a national energy strategy that will include a
mix of oil, natural gas, coal, nuclear power, renewable energy and
energy conservation.
   While developing a domestic energy policy, Lujan said, the
United States and energy industry face the challenge of ``securing
a healthy and safe environmental future for our children and future
generations of America.''
   In a news conference afterward, Lujan said, ``You have to be
more environmentally sensitive if you're going to move the industry
along.''
   As for his own agency, Lujan said, the Department of the
Interior now has more of an ``environmental tilt'' than in past
administrations.
   Lujan said he doesn't believe oil imports will decrease any time
soon and are approaching 60 percent of the U.S. oil supply.
   He also said that opposition to oil well drilling on the outer
continental shelf, particularly off the Florida and California
coasts, will preclude much future exploration and development there.
   ``It's going to be very difficult for us to offer those
resources.''
   Lujan is chairing a five-agency task force expected to make
recommendations to President Bush in early 1990 on drilling on the
outer continental shelf.

<TEXT>
   London stock prices were higher at midday
Wednesday, thanks to renewed buying interest in a few select stocks.
   Dealers said trading volume, which has been light in recent
days, picked up after a lackluster opening.
   At 12:15 p.m. in London the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index was up 12.1 points, or 0.6 percent, at 2,154.7
points.
   Dealers said most investor interest focused on high-quality
stocks, often with limited British exposure. Several key blue-chip
stocks were pushed higher due to one or two large buy orders, a
trader said.
   Sterling's strong tone, combined with indications of a steady
opening on Wall Street later Wednesday, combined to tempt some
investors back into the market.
   Volume came to 225 million shares by midday, compared with 182.8
million shares at the same time Tuesday.

   Jaguar PLC's shares soared on London's Stock
Exchange after the government said it was prepared to waive its
right under a special Jaguar share it owns to block a takeover of
the British luxury automaker.
   The government's announcement Tuesday, which surprised Jaguar,
makes it possible for General Motors Corp. or Ford Motor Co. _ both
of which own Jaguar stakes _ or any other suitor to take proposals
to Jaguar's shareholders.
   Industry analysts in the United States said the decision by the
government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher benefits Ford more
than GM. GM has said it would like a minority stake in Jaguar,
while Ford has said it might mount a full takeover bid.
   ``It makes the game a little more fair right now,'' said analyst
Kathleen Heaney of Nikko Securities Co. International Inc. in New
York. ``As of yesterday, it looked like GM was the favorite. Now,
it looks like it's anybody's game.''
   ``It suggests to me that the government is more pro-shareholder
than anything else,'' said analyst Scott Merlis of Morgan Stanley
and Co. of New York. ``Once again the Thatcher philosophy of
non-intervention could prevail here.''
   Both Ford and GM could use the prestige of a Jaguar nameplate in
their model lineup and Jaguar's manufacturing and technical
facilities in England. There have been reports that GM and Jaguar
were working on a proposal for a jointly produced vehicle, but
neither company has commented on it.
   Jaguar's shares were trading at the equivalent of $13.97 in
London at midday Wednesday, up 24 cents from Tuesday's close. They
rose $1.93 in Tuesday's session.
   Trade Secretary Nicholas Ridley said in the House of Commons
that if Jaguar's shareholders voted by a 75 percent majority to
lift a 15 percent restriction on holdings in Jaguar, the government
would drop its special, or ``golden,'' share that it could use to
block any takeover.
   The golden share and the 15 percent limit had been due to expire
at the end of 1990. The restrictions were established in 1984 when
the government sold the former state-owned car maker.
   Ridley said the government's remaining role would be to assess
the impact a takeover might have on competition in the British auto
industry.
   Jaguar, which has suffered from a slump in U.S. sales, on which
it depends heavily, is looking for a partner to give it financial
and technological support, but it wants to remain independent.
   But Jaguar's shareholders are unlikely to agree to proposals
that fall short of a full bid, analysts have said.
   The luxury carmaker could fetch up to $15.80 a share, or $2.8
billion, if GM and Ford engage in a bidding war for Jaguar,
analysts have estimated.
   GM has been holding friendly talks with Jaguar in recent weeks
in an effort to reach a cooperation agreement with the company,
which is expected to be announced by mid-November.
   The agreement is expected to call for GM to take a minority
stake of perhaps 30 percent in Jaguar and run several joint
ventures, including the manufacture of a new, cheaper Jaguar.
   Ford has said it has a 13.2 percent interest in Jaguar through
market stock purchases. Ford has said that it is prepared to mount
a full bid for Jaguar once the takeover restrictions are dropped.
   Both U.S. auto makers have obtained U.S. regulatory approval to
buy up to 15 percent of Jaguar.
   Ford spokesman Rex Greenslade in Detroit said Tuesday that his
company had no comment on anything to do with Jaguar.
   GM spokesman Jack Harned read a company statement saying the
automaker would study the action by the British government. He
declined to answer any questions.
   Jaguar, which has been holding talks with numerous companies in
the past 18 months, said it hadn't been consulted in advance about
Ridley's move. ``We were surprised at the action taken,'' the
company said in a statement.
   Jaguar emphasized that its articles of association still prevent
any individual or company from owning more than 15 percent of
Jaguar without a special resolution at an extraordinary shareholder
meeting.
   An extraordinary meeting can be called by the board or by a
shareholder who has a Jaguar holding of at least 10 percent, said
Jaguar spokesman Arnold Bolton.

<HEAD>Adviser to Revco Creditors Says Others Have Expressed Interest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THOMAS J. SHEERAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Texas group offering $925 million for Revco
D.S. Inc., which is reorganizing its finances in bankruptcy court,
may have competition for the 27-state chain of drug stores.
   David Schulte, an adviser to Revco bondholders, said billionaire
Robert M. Bass and Acadia Partners haven't been the only ones to
show an interest in the company. However, he declined to elaborate.
   Schulte said Tuesday that the Bass offer was a ``mark of the
improving fortunes of the company, for sure.''
   Jeffrey Stein, an analyst with McDonald &amp; Co. of Cleveland, said
the bid reflected Revco's prescription business, which is about 30
percent of its sales, and the increasing number of older Americans
more dependent on prescription drugs.
   Stein said that, if bought at the right price, Revco could
operate profitably.
   Revco, whose 1,900 stores fill 65 million prescriptions yearly,
said it still needed more information about the bid, made in an
Oct. 20 letter from Acadia and the Robert M. Bass Group Inc. of
Fort Worth, Texas.
   ``We don't consider this an offer,'' said Revco spokeswoman
Diana Lueptow.
   A federal bankruptcy judge has given Revco the right to propose
a plan to reorganize its finances until Feb. 28 and gave Revco
another two months to seek approval of the plan from creditors.
   ``Right now, all we're doing is getting more information,'' Ms.
Lueptow said. ``Right now, we don't feel we have all the
information we need.''
   Boake A. Sells, chairman and chief executive officer of Revco,
said the Bass offer involved $150 million in cash for all equity in
the reorganized company and $775 million in notes.
   The Bass organization has a policy that ``we don't discuss any
business with the news media,'' said a woman handling news
inquiries at Bass offices in Fort Worth. She declined to identify
herself.
   Acadia Partners specializes in leveraged acquisitions and is
capitalized in excess of $1.6 billion. Principal partners include
the Bass group.
   Robert Bass, whose holdings were valued at $1.6 billion in the
latest Forbes 400 list of wealthy individuals, has interests in
real estate, finances and oil.
   Anac Holding Corp., parent of Revco, reported a quarterly loss
Sept. 29 of $16.2 million, compared with a $27.9 million loss for
the same period last year. Sales increased 2.4 percent, from $583
million to $597 million.

<TEXT>
   Domino's Pizza Inc. says it will trim
jobs and cut back health benefits in a cost-cutting effort that was
stepped up when founder Tom Monaghan said he might sell the pizza
delivery company.
   Domino's will lay off nearly 100 employees in departments
including public relations, accounting, legal and video at its Ann
Arbor headquarters and 13 offices throughout the country, spokesman
Ron Hingst said Tuesday.
   Costs of health care benefits, now paid by the company, will be
shared by employees. Hingst said he didn't know how much the
employees would have to pay.
   ``This is based on an ongoing review of the business plan that
will guide Domino's Pizza into the next decade,'' company President
Dave Black said in a letter mailed Tuesday to employees.
   The company decided in 1987 to cut costs and stepped up the
effort recently when Monaghan announced he would consider selling
the privately held company to focus on charity work.
   Dominos, the second-largest pizza company after Pizza Hut,
employs about 40,000 people worldwide, and said it earned $6.1
million last year on sales of $2.3 billion.

   Japanese and other foreign institutional investors

   ``These mutual funds create an additional channel for the flow

<HEAD>Unisys Stockholder Sues Board, Alleging Withheld Information</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Unisys Corp. stockholder has filed a class
action suit accusing the company's board of using misleading and
false information to receive a 1988 shareholders' vote supporting
the board.
   Henry L. Housman, of the Philadelphia metropolitan area, names
13 board members in Tuesday's suit, which alleges that the
company's 1988 Proxy Statement failed to disclose facts concerning
fraud in connection with government defense contracts, an internal
investigation of defense contracting units and a ``continuing
cover-up'' of wrongdoings.
   Unisys, a leading producer of electronics-based information
systems with more than 92,500 employees, designs and manufactures
main frame computers, software and systems engineering support
services for use in various technology defense projects.
   The precise number of plaintiffs are not known, but consist of
anyone who held Unysis common stock on March 22, 1988, when the
proxy statement was issued, according to the suit. There are over
158 million shares of Unisys common stock outstanding, held by over
42,000 holders of record.
   The 1988 Proxy Statement requested shareholders to approve an
indemnification agreement, which would have protected board
directors against lawsuits ``by reason of the fact that the
director is or was serving one or more capacities as a director or
officer of'' the company.
   The suit alleges that Unisys directors have artificially
inflated labor and cost data, entered into sham consulting
agreements, made illegal contributions, padded expense accounts,
inflated invoices submitted by subcontractors and permitted some
individuals to benefit personally by funneling money through hollow
``fund companies.''
   Unisys has been the subject of several federal law enforcement
and grand jury investigations, including the ongoing ``Operation
Ill Wind'' dealing with defense contractors, and, the suit alleges,
could thereby be subject to potential fines from $30 million to $60
million.
   James R. Malone, Jr., the attorney representing the
shareholders, said he knew of two similar cases against Unisys in
Eastern Pennsylvania and another in Delaware. He declined to
comment on the other cases, which are still in litigation.
   The suit seeks to have the board members removed and to have the
actions taken as a result of the proxy declared null and void, in
addition to unspecified damages.

<HEAD>Tentative Agreement Reported Between Sony, Warner</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sony Corp. and Warner Bros. have reached a
tentative agreement to avoid a looming court battle over Hollywood
film producers Peter Guber and Jon Peters, it was reported today.
   The possible settlement would allow Guber and Peters, producers
of such films as ``Batman'' and ``Rain Man'' to break their
five-year contract with Warner Bros. to head Columbia Pictures
Entertainment, which Sony is buying, according to published
reports, which cited unidentified sources.
   A court hearing was scheduled for Thursday to hear Warner's
request for an injunction barring Guber and Peters from
``reneging'' on the Warner Bros. contract they signed this year.
   But Tuesday, Sony, Warner and Guber-Peters Entertainment issued
a brief statement saying they had asked for the hearing to be
delayed for an indefinite time ``to allow the parties to have
further discussions.''
   To settle the dispute, Warner would receive about 35 percent of
the 150-acre Burbank Studios in exchange for the Lorimar studio lot
in Culver City, according to a report in today's editions of the
Los Angeles Times.
   Warner Bros. already owns 65 percent of the Burbank lot, the
newspaper reported.
   Sony also would give Warner Bros. a share in the company's
lucrative CBS Record Club to release the two producers, the Times
said.
   In exchange, Guber and Peters would have to give up all rights
to Warner-backed film projects, including the two scheduled sequels
to ``Batman,'' the Times and the Los Angeles Herald Examiner
reported.
   ``They're leaving empty-handed,'' an unidentified source told
the Herald.
   Neither newspaper specified when the tentative agreement was
reached or when it might become official.
   Sony wants Guber and Peters to run Columbia Pictures, which the
Japanese company is acquiring for $3.4 billion. Sony also is paying
the pair $200 million for their Guber-Peters Entertainment Co.
   Warner, a unit of Time Warner Inc., contends it already has
invested or committed $13 million in 50 projects under development
by Guber and Peters.
   The two producers said in court documents that Warner had let
them out of their contract with an oral agreement.
   In a court filing, Warner Bros. President Terry Semel denied
letting Guber and Peters go.
   ``I do not make oral agreements to terminate written agreements,
especially when they involve key talent and millions of dollars,''
Semel said.
   The estimated cost of the settlement deal between the
entertainment companies over Guber and Peters could run as high as
$500 million, mostly in a swap of property and film rights, a
source told the Herald.
   ``This deal is going to end up costing Sony a bundle,'' the
source said.

<HEAD>Philip Morris Plans Massive Corporate TV Ad Campaign</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Expands on original, which was sent inadvertently.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Philip Morris Cos. Inc. is launching a
corporate-image advertising campaign that puts the Philip Morris
name in TV ads for the first time since the 1950s, when it quit
advertising its namesake cigarette brand on television.
   The campaign is a patriotic tribute to the 200th anniversary of
the Bill of Rights, a favorite issue of supporters of ``smokers'
rights.''
   But the TV advertising does not mention cigarettes or smoking,
the company said. Cigarette ads have been banned from television
since 1971, and Philip Morris quit advertising its Philip Morris
brand on TV in the early 1950s.
   Nonetheless, there were published reports today that some
anti-smoking activists fault the company for trying to score points
with the public by associating itself with a document that is a
cornerstone of American democracy.
   Philip Morris declined to say how much it planned to spend on
the advertising campaign. But one source familiar with the
company's plans said it could amount to $30 million a year for two
years.
   The first advertising in the campaign appeared in print and on
network television this morning.
   The ad contains a toll-free number people can call to obtain a
copy of the Bill of Rights, and Guy L. Smith IV, vice president for
corporate affairs at Philip Morris, said there were 5,000 calls in
the first hour after the commercial was on television.
   Smith said the company decided on this approach to familiarize
the public with a company that ``is a very different and much
larger company than it was just a few years ago.''
   In addition to its Philip Morris USA tobacco division, Philip
Morris also owns Miller Brewing Co. and Kraft General Foods.
   Its products include Marlboro cigarettes, Miller beer, Jell-O
desserts, Kraft cheese and salad dressings and Maxwell House coffee.

<TEXT>
   Maxwell Graphics Inc. says it will be
acquired for $500 million in cash and securities by Quebecor Inc.
of Montreal, a printing, publishing and forest-products company.
   Maxwell Graphics, a division of Maxwell Communications Corp.,
which bought the St. Paul-based Webb Companies in 1986, has three
printing plants in Minnesota and prints the Sunday newspaper
supplement Parade, as well as Time, Sports Illustrated and TV Guide
magazines. It moved its U.S. headquarters to St. Paul earlier this
year.
   Bob Smith, president of Maxwell Graphics, said Tuesday that no
jobs are expected to be lost as a result of the acquisition. He
said a planned $20 million expenditure in the three Minnesota
printing plants next year will proceed.
   Maxwell Communications will receive $400 million in cash and
hold 20 percent of what will be a new Quebecor printing division,
which has not yet been named. Quebecor will own 57.5 percent of its
new subsidiary. The other 22.5 percent will be held by a pension
fund agency of the Quebec government.
   Quebecor has about 40 printing plants in Canada, Smith said, all
much smaller than Maxwell's 15 U.S. plants. The Maxwell acquisition
will double the new division's present size, he said.

   The U.S. economy's manufacturing sector remained weak in

the nation's corporate purchasing managers said today.
   New orders overall, however, posted an increase after four
months of decline, suggesting that the future rate of manufacturing
decline is easing, said the survey by the National Association of
Purchasing Management.
   The Purchasing Manager's Index, a widely watched barometer of
the economy's direction, rose to 47.6 percent from 46 percent in
September and 45.2 percent in August.
   The survey showed the sixth straight month of decline in the
nation's manufacturing sector, but the second consecutive month in
which the rate of decline was less than the previous month.
   A reading below 50 percent indicates the manufacturing sector of
the economy is in decline while a reading above 50 percent
indicates growth, according to the association.
   ``Continued declines in vendor deliveries and price indexes
indicate that supply is considerably greater than demand,'' said
Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the purchasing management association.
   But the sharp turnaround in new orders growth ``hints of a
possible continued easing in the overall future rate of decline in
the manufacturing economy,'' he said. The new orders index rose to
51.4 percent, up from 45.4 percent in September.
   Although new export orders continued to grow they were down
sharply from September. The export index fell to 55.5 percent from
60.5 percent.
   Vendor deliveries, production, prices, inventories and
employment all declined, according to the survey.
   The monthly report is based on a survey of purchasing executives
in more than 250 industrial companies. The index is a composite of
six separate indicators, including new orders, production, vendor
deliveries, inventories, prices and employment.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were narrowly
mixed in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade with
market activity limited by the All Saints Day holiday in much of
Europe and South America.
   The corn market weakened slightly amid rumors that the Soviet
Union may delay taking delivery on some of the U.S. corn it
recently bought.
   Record-high Soviet corn purchases announced last month have
stirred concerns that the U.S. grain transportation system may be
strained in trying to deliver all the corn quickly.
   ``We're asking the transportation system to run full tilt and,
given the low water levels (for river shipping), it may be
difficult to achieve it,'' said Dale Gustafson, a grain analyst
with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in Chicago.
   Some minor foreign purchases of U.S. wheat supported the wheat
market in early trading while soybeans were mostly lower due in
part to slack export demand.
   In early trading, wheat futures prices were { cent lower to 1{
cents higher with the contract for delivery in December at $3.94\ a
bushel; corn was { cent lower to } cent higher with December at
$2.37 a bushel; oats were \ cent to { cent lower with December at

   Cattle futures were lower while pork futures were mixed in early
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .05 cent to .35 cent lower with December at
74.12 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .22 cent lower
with November at 83 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent lower to .18
cent higher with December at 46.52 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .42 cent lower to .10 cent higher with February at

<TEXT>
   Totes Inc., which makes and sells products
including umbrellas, boots and other footwear, says it is
purchasing a West German company which distributes umbrellas.
   Bradford Phillips, Totes' chief executive officer, said he
signed the agreement Tuesday in West Germany to buy Jagra-Haus
Gmbh. The German company will be renamed Totes Deutschland.
   Phillips refused to reveal the purchase price. He said it was a
cash transaction.
   Totes, based in Loveland, has annual sales of approximately $200
million.
   Phillips said Jagra-Haus will begin distributing Totes' full
line of umbrellas, boots and overshoes in early 1991. The German
firm will also distribute products of Totes' Chromatics division,
which makes lower-priced versions of Totes items sold under the
Chromatics name.
   Totes wants to expand Jagra-Haus' business territory beyond West
Germany, Phillips said.
   He said Totes may slightly increase its Loveland work force
beyond the current 550 people, as a result of the West German
acquisition.

   Georgia-Pacific Corp.'s offer to buy
Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. for $3.13 billion may attract bids
from other corporations interested in acquiring the paper products
company, analysts say.
   Great Northern's stock surged $20.12{ a share to close at
$62.87{ Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, a jump of nearly 50
percent that exceeded Georgia-Pacific's offering price of $58 a
share. That indicates investors believe a higher offer may emerge.
   Georgia-Pacific's stock dropped $2.50 a share to close at
$50.87{.
   Analysts said bids may come from such forest and paper products
companies as Jefferson Smurfit Corp., Champion International Co.,
International Paper Corp., Weyerhaeuser Co. and Abitibi-Price Inc.
   Great Northern, based in Norwalk, also could pursue a merger
with Champion or Boise Cascade Corp., said Mark Kurland, an analyst
with Nabon Nugent &amp; Co. in New York.
   Industry spokesmen said the offer was the first unsolicited
takeover bid in the U.S. paper industry, and confirmed market
rumors of the past few days that Georgia-Pacific would try to take
over Great Northern, which makes paper products, lumber and plywood.
   The company, which has 3.5 million acres of timberland and
20,000 employees, reported sales of $3.6 billion last year.
   Georgia-Pacific, which is based in Atlanta, had $9.5 billion in
sales, making paper, other forest products and building materials.
It owns 6.5 million acres of timberland and 380 plants and mills
employing 44,000 workers.
   Great Northern Chairman William R. Laidig said in a statement
that Georgia-Pacific's offer was uninvited but would be considered
``in due course'' by the company's board of directors. Company
officials declined further comment.
   Georgia-Pacific Chairman T. Marshall Hahn Jr. stressed the offer
was a friendly one that he and Laidig discussed Monday night on the
telephone.
   ``I indicated that all terms are negotiable,'' he said Tuesday
in New York. ``Bill is a personal friend. I hold him and the
management of Great Northern in the highest regard.''
   Nevertheless, Georgia-Pacific filed a complaint Tuesday in U.S.
District Court in Portland, Maine, challenging that state's
year-old anti-takeover statute. The law requires a hostile raider
to wait five years before completing a merger unless the deal wins
prior approval from directors of the target company.
   Great Northern is incorporated in Maine and is the state's
largest landowner. In a related suit, Georgia-Pacific asked the
court to throw out several anti-takeover provisions in Great
Northern's by-laws.
   A top Georgia-Pacific executive on Tuesday briefed Maine Gov.
John R. McKernan and other top state officials in Augusta about the
buyout proposal.
   ``What we are stressing to the leaders of the state is that this
is a cash offer by an operating company. This is not an LBO
(leveraged buyout). We are not breakup artists,'' said A.D.
``Pete'' Correll, executive vice president in charge of pulp and
paper.
   Hahn said the merged company would be more competitive globally
and would offer more job stability to Georgia-Pacific and Great
Northern employees.
   ``This is not like so many transactions you see today. We're
operators, not liquidators. We see this as an opportunity time,''
he said.
   Under the tender offer, Georgia-Pacific would buy about 54
million outstanding common shares for $58 a share, a deal that
values the company at $3.13 billion. The acquisition would total
$4.5 billion including refinancing costs, fees and expenses.
   Georgia-Pacific said its bid represented a 50 percent premium
over the market price of Great Northern before takeover speculation
drove up the stock's price starting Thursday.
   The company said the deal was conditioned on, among other
things, acquiring at least 75 percent of Great Northern's
outstanding shares by Nov. 29 and the dismantling by Great Northern
of some of its takeover defenses.
   The bid comes at the end of a period of strong expansion in the
paper industry that was sparked by the decline of the dollar and
healthy economic growth.
   Lately, paper industry profits have slumped as the dollar has
rebounded, making imports cheaper and exports more expensive, and
economic growth has slowed.

   A home-buying opportunity seems to be shaping up
for some of those people who were priced and ``rated'' out of the
market over the past couple of years.
   Median prices in most of the country have stabilized and are
likely to remain so with winter coming on, and mortgage rates have
fallen over the past month. Mortgage money is plentiful too, and
many sellers are eager.
   This latter factor is often overlooked by buyers accustomed to
feeling like beggars, but many sellers are reportedly anxious to
move their properties after enduring months of waiting, and missing
out on the August ``school'' market.
   For obvious reasons, families with school-age children often
plan their change of address before the beginning of a new school
year, making the late summer weeks among the very best for real
estate transactions.
   Partly reflecting this phenomenon, median home prices actually
declined in September from August in the four geographical regions
_ Northeast, Midwest, South and West _ measured by the National
Association of Realtors.
   The national median price for existing single-family homes in
September was $93,400, down $1,400 from August, although higher by
5.5 percent than a year earlier. Big price increases aren't
expected in most markets.
   Meanwhile, improvements in the mortgage market have made rates
more attractive compared to a year ago, or in fact to a few weeks
ago.
   HSH Associates, which monitors rates of 2,000 lenders
nationwide, reports fixed-rate, 30-year mortgages in single digits
again, and adjustable-rate mortgages far down into the 8 percent to
9 percent range.
   Its survey for the week ended Oct. 20 showed the national
average for 30-year fixed rates fell to 9.98 percent, compared with
10.03 percent a week earlier, and more than a full percentage point
lower than a year ago.
   Many of the indexes for adjustable-rate mortgages also have
fallen in recent weeks. The six-month Treasury bill fell to 7.42
percent on Oct. 20 from 7.64 percent a month earlier. The constant
maturity 3-year Treasury fell to 7.94 percent from 8.19 percent,
and the 5-year to 7.92 percent from 8.12 percent.
   Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. reports also show rates
declining. Its latest report, for September, listed 30-year
fixed-rate mortgages at 10.16 percent, compared with 11.19 percent
as recently as six months ago, amid indications of a further
decline in October and perhaps November too.
   HSH says its data base shows well over 550 lenders offering
30-year fixed-rate loans at under 10 percent, with many as low as
9.25 percent, a figure that even experienced mortgage people had
recently thought was a thing of the past.
   The news already has affected markets, suggesting that buyers
are extremely sensitive to rates. September sales of existing
single-family houses were at an annual rate of 3.63 million units,
4.3 percent higher than in August.
   Ira Gribin, Realtor president, believes that rate-consciousness
accounts for much of the increase. ``Many people who were forced to
put off trading up or entering the market earlier this year are
making their move now,'' he says.
   Realtor economist John Tuccillo believes that compared with
higher-priced houses, moderate-priced units tend to do well in the
fall, reflecting a market shift to smaller families whose decisions
aren't based on the school year.
   Paul Havemann, HSH vice president, thinks higher-priced units
will share in the improved market. Lower rates will spur all
buyers, he says, ``especially in higher-priced areas where sellers
are relucatant to lower their prices.''
   However, problems still remain for first-time buyers. While
price increases are not as common as they were a year ago, incomes
lag. Median prices in the Northeast and West remain close to
$145,000, while the September median in the Midwest was $71,800,
and in the South, $84,200.
   Medians can deceive, however, and discourage too, leading many
real estate people to point out that communities with high medians
might also have many sound houses priced well within the range of
first-timers.

<TEXT>
   Sam Kusumoto, the head of Minolta Camera Co.'s
U.S. operations, says he doesn't envy his counterparts at American
corporations.
   ``I feel sorry for American CEOs. They have to be creative and
always coming out with new ideas,'' he said.
   And for an executive like him, ``a guy over 60,'' that can be
pretty stressful, said Kusumoto, president and chief executive
officer of Ramsey, N.J.-based Minolta Corp.
   American executives are under a lot of pressure, said Kusumoto.
While it's true they are highly paid, they also face high risks. If
their ideas don't work or if they make the wrong choice, ``They're
out of there,'' he said.
   Kusumoto, 61, who first came to the United States in 1954, has
been president of Minolta since 1969 _ making him one of the
longest-serving Japanese executives in America and giving him a
unique perspective on how a country left in ruins by war could turn
into one of the world's strongest economic powers.
   In 1987 he was elected secretary of the Japanese Chamber of
Commerce of New York. E.P. Dutton is publishing his autobiography,
``My Bridge to America,'' this month.
   In Washington recently to attend a White House luncheon,
Kusumoto, who now lives in Fort Lee, N.J., discussed the Japanese
way of management, the Japanese and U.S. educational systems and
Japan's image in America.
   While American corporations are run from the top down by
high-powered executives making astronomical salaries, Japanese are
run from the middle out, said Kusumoto. Middle managers, closer in
age to 35 than 65, tend to come up with the ideas and innovations.
Top management tends to keep a lower profile.
   If an idea is a success, the company shares the credit. If it
goes awry there's no finger-pointing or dismissals; everyone shares
the blame. Japanese workers see their company as a second family
and usually stay for the entire career.
   That stability, says Kusumoto, is one of the main reasons
Japanese corporations have been so successful since World War II.
   At Japanese companies, ``The difference between the top and the
bottom is not that great,'' he said.
   ``We don't have anybody making a million dollars,'' said
Kusumoto, arguing that because there isn't a vast salary gap
between executives and workers, there are fewer labor problems in
Japan.
   In fact, at most of Japan's largest companies, the top
executives' salaries are only about seven times greater than a new
employee right out of college, he said.
   To compensate for that, Japanese executives get lots of fringe
benefits: a company car _ maybe even a chauffeured limousine _ and
an unlimited expense account. In return, they have the peace of
mind that goes with stable, possibly lifetime employment.
   But that management style can run into problems when the
Japanese company operates in the United States, where success is
measured by salary and title.
   Fast-track American executives who don't get the raise or the
promotion they want move on, said Kusumoto, upsetting the harmony
that Japanese concerns strive for.
   To counter that, Minolta has come up with a simple plan: pay the
Americans more.
   Kusumoto noted that he has three Japanese vice presidents and
four American vice presidents and ``a few of the Americans make
more money than I do.''
   While none of the Japanese executives are making as much as the
Americans ``they don't care,'' said Kusumoto because they know it
is important to the company, which has earned their loyalty.
   As part of this drive to seek harmony, Kusumoto's staff, which
he takes to Japan once a year _ the Americans as well as the
Japanese _ make their decisions by consensus. In fact, there are so
many meetings, they've had to add several new conference rooms to
the New Jersey headquarters.
   ``The Japanese system, in my opinion, is better,'' Kusumoto said.
   Sam Kusumoto's given name is actually Sadahei. He was born to
Japanese parents in what is now Seoul, South Korea, where his
father was a successful Ford distributor.
   At the end of World War II the family returned to Japan, where
Kusumoto, then 18 years old, enrolled in Tokyo's Keio University,
majoring in economics. Shortly after completing his studies in
1953, Kusumoto joined Minolta.
   Within a year, he was sent to the United States as Minolta's
sole representative. He returned to company headquarters in Osaka
in 1959, rising to head the international sales division.
   Since 1969, when he was named head of Minolta's U.S. marketing
subsidiary for all its photographic and office automation products,
he has lived in this country with his family. His two daughters
went to American colleges.
   While trade deficits, import barriers and currency fluctuations
take their toll on U.S.-Japanese relations, Kusumoto thinks there
is something else ``irritating American people deep in their
heart:'' what they perceive as the ingratitude of the Japanese.
   ``One of the biggest problems in Japanese education is they
don't teach anything about (what happened) after World War II,'' he
said.
   Consequently, ``Young Japanese don't know what Americans did for
Japan after the war,'' and Americans can't understand why Japan
isn't more grateful for the assistance they rendered war-shattered
Japan.
   ``If the Japanese were more modest. If they said `Thank You
America.' Then, I think this Japan bashing would go,'' Kusumoto
said.

<HEAD>British Luxury Car Maker Faces Tough Fight For Its Independence</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Jaguar PLC, the luxury automaker with the leaping
cat logo, may have a tough time staying out of the cage of General
Motors Corp. or Ford Motor Co.
   Many analysts expect the world's No. 1 and 2 automakers to stage
a multibillion-dollar bidding war for Jaguar, which is suffering
the latest in several reversals of fortune that date back to its
founding 67 years ago.
   The U.S. rivals are believed to want to pitch Jaguars against
new Japanese luxury models.
   ``It's looking increasingly likely. It is very much squaring up
for a fight between these two,'' said Stephen Reitman, an auto
analyst with the London investment firm UBS Phillips and Drew.
``Both of them will fight very hard for it, which suggests a
bare-knuckle fight.''
   The British government on Tuesday opened the way for competing
bids by announcing that it would waive its ``golden share,'' which
gave it the power to block any takeover.
   Trade Secretary Nicholas Ridley said that if Jaguar's
shareholders voted by a 75 percent majority to lift a 15 percent
limit on the size of a single investor's Jaguar holdings, the
government would drop its veto power.
   The veto rights were imposed when the government sold off the
former state-owned car maker in 1984. They were to expire at the
end of 1990.
   No. 2 Ford has said it is prepared to make a full bid for Jaguar
when takeover restrictions are lifted. Ford had bought 13.2 percent
by early this past week.
   Jaguar calls Ford's move unwelcome and is negotiating a friendly
cooperation agreement with General Motors in which GM would take a
minority stake of perhaps ultimately 30 percent in the British
company. GM has obtained U.S. regulatory approval to buy up to 15
percent.
   Jaguar Chairman Sir John Egan has said he hoped to announce an
agreement with GM by mid-November. Such a deal might include plans
to jointly manufacture a less expensive executive model, Egan said.
Jaguar's cheapest car costs $39,700.
   ``We believe that preserving Jaguar's independence is in the
best interest of everyone associated with the company,'' Egan said
at a British car show. ``Our desire has always been to keep our
destiny firmly in our own hands.''
   But Jaguar's shareholders aren't likely to approve a limited
tie-up with GM, because they would like to see a full bid, said
John Lawson, an automotive analyst with Nomura Securities in London.
   This could prompt both companies to make full takeover offers,
and the winner could end up paying more than $3 billion, the
analysts said. Takeover speculation has more than doubled Jaguar's
share price since before Ford signaled its interest.
   Jaguar has fallen on hard times again because the weak dollar
and a luxury car sales slump have hurt its crucial U.S. sales. It's
looking for a linkup that would give it the technology and
financial resources to expand its line of cars to become more
competitive.
   Jaguar is vulnerable because it has a small product range _ it
produces 50,000 XJ6 and Series III sedans, XJS sports cars and
limousines a year _ and it needs to invest heavily to modernize.
   ``We have talked to large number of companies over the past 18
months,'' said Jaguar spokesman Arnold Bolton.
   What makes Jaguar attractive is that it is one of the last
independent luxury marks available. Hollywood stars such as the
late Clark Gable and modern royalty including Prince Charles have
owned Jaguars, which are loaded with luxurious touches such as
leather upholstery and walnut paneling.
   A major auto maker risks hurting Jaguar's cachet if it takes
over the British company entirely, said Lawson, the analyst. But it
also risks making a poor return on its investment if it doesn't,
and only takes a stake, he said.
   ``There is a danger that you destroy the thing that sells the
cars if you try and make this part of an international group,''
Lawson said.
   ``A lot of Jaguar sales are based on it being a traditional,
sporting gentleman's car and being English. This is a fashion
industry. Jaguar is the Burberry of the car industry.''
   The best strategy, Lawson said, is to expand Jaguar into
``BMW-type territory.'' But that would require a huge investment in
plant and equipment, he said.
   Jaguar was launched in 1922 as the Swallow Sidecar Co. in
Blackpool. Swallow introduced its first car in 1927, and a year
later moved to Coventry, the center of the British car industry, 95
miles northwest of London.
   It produced a line of SS cars in the 1930s and changed its name
to Jaguar Cars Ltd. at the end of World War II. In 1968, it became
a part of the state automaker British Leyland.
   Jaguar fared badly under state stewardship. It suffered an
after-tax loss of $84 million in 1980 and developed a poor
reputation for quality control.
   Egan, who took over nine years ago, is largely credited with
turning Jaguar around by cutting costs, more than tripling
production per worker and expanding sales in Europe and the Far
East.
   Jaguar was being hailed as a prime example of a successful
privatization, along with British Airways PLC and British Steel PLC.
   But Jaguar remained overly dependent on the extremely
competitive U.S. market, where it still sells 40 percent of its
cars, and it was clobbered when the dollar and U.S. luxury car
sales slumped.
   Jaguar's after-tax profit peaked at $141 million in 1985. It
sank to $99 million in 1987 and then to $46 million in 1988 on
revenue of $1.07 billion. Analysts are expecting Jaguar to lose
money in 1989.

   The U.S. dollar fell against most major currencies
in directionless European trading Wednesday thinned by the All
Souls' Day holiday. Gold prices also declined.
   Financial markets were closed in Italy, Spain, France, and
Belgium for the holiday. In West Germany, only banks in Frankfurt
and northern Germany were open.
   Traders said they had no reason to take large positions before
Friday's release of the U.S. employment figures for October, which
are expected to confirm the U.S. economy's slower pace of growth.
   ``No one is willing to be over-adventurous ahead of Friday's
figures,'' said a corporate dealer in London.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose to 143.08 Japanese yen from 142.15 yen at
Tuesday's close. Later, in London, it rose further to 143.45 yen.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.5815 from $1.5775 late
Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday:
1.8377 West German marks, down from 1.8410; 1.6132 Swiss francs,
down from 1.6142; 6.2305 French francs, down from 6.2445; 2.0790
Dutch guilders, up from 2.0730; 1.1742 Canadian dollars, unchanged;
and 1,348.50 Italian lire, down from 1,349.75.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid of $374.25 a troy ounce from
$377.75 late Tuesday. In Zurich, gold traded at $373.40 an ounce,
down from $375.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold slipped $2.92 to close at $373.87 an

   Share prices finished moderately higher Wednesday
in London, bolstered largely by continued gains on Wall Street and
technical factors affecting demand for blue-chip stocks.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed 17.5
points, or 0.8 percent, higher at 2,160.1.
   The key index rose throughout most of the session after posting
a low of 2,141.7 in the first 40 minutes of trading. It ended the
day near its session high of 2,163.2, which was posted within the
last half-hour.
   Volume was a light 372.9 million shares, up from 334.5 million
on Tuesday.
   Dealers said most investor interest was focused on blue-chip
stocks. They said several key blue chips were pushed higher in
light volume due to a technical squeeze among market makers.
   The British pound's strong tone, combined with a steady opening
on Wall Street, also tempted some investors to come back to the
London market, dealers said. There was concern early in the day
that Wall Street's sharp gains on Tuesday were overdone and due for
a reversal.
   In London, the Financial Times 30-share index finished 16.7
points higher at 1,738.1. The Financial Times 500-share index rose
10.34 points to close at 1,198.81.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House today overwhelmingly approved
legislation to raise the hourly minimum wage to $4.25 by April 1991
and establish a lower training wage for some teen-agers new to the
job market.
   The 382-37 vote came just a day after the White House and
Democratic congressional leaders reached agreement on the plan,
which would provide the first increase in the $3.35 minimum wage
since 1981.
   President Bush vetoed an earlier bill to raise the minimum wage
to $4.55 an hour, and the Democratic-controlled House sustained the
veto.
   Senate leaders have promised to vote on the compromise soon in
hopes of getting it to the White House for Bush's signature before
Thanksgiving.
   Many lawmakers from both parties found fault with the
compromise, with Democrats saying the increase was not big enough
and some Republicans saying there should be no boost. But most said
the deal was the best political compromise possible.
   ``No one got exactly what they wanted,'' said Rep. William
Goodling of Pennsylvania, ranking Republican on the House Education
and Labor Committee. ``I think we got the best that we could.''
   Rep. Alan Wheat, D-Mo., said the increase should have been
bigger but passage of the compromise ``represents this body's
commitment to an honest day's pay for an honest day's work.''
   Before the debate, House Speaker Thomas Foley said final passage
of the proposal would mark ``one of the major achievements of the
101st Congress.''
   ``A year or two ago it seemed as though no compromise was in
sight,'' said Rep. Austin Murphy, D-Pa.
   Foley attributed President Bush's decision to drop his refusal
to compromise on the issue to the fact that Democrats were close to
getting a veto-proof majority on a bill of their own. He said
Republicans found it ``embarrassing'' for Bush not to give in on
the minimum wage while demanding a capital gains tax cut for the
wealthy.
   The measure would create a new ``subminimum wage'' for
teen-agers with little job experience, allowing them to be paid 85
percent of the minimum wage for their first three months in the
work force. The lower rate could be extended for another three
months if an employer showed that the youths were receiving
specific skills training.
   ``This package offers the promise of better wages for the
working men and women of this country and gives incentives to
create new jobs for our young people,'' Bush said in a written
statement that commended organized labor and congressional leaders.
   Both sides made significant concessions in an effort to avoid a
repeat of Bush's veto of minimum wage legislation earlier this
year, which was sustained by the House.
   Democrats acknowledged giving ground but said it was necessary
to guarantee a boost in the minimum wage, which has been frozen at
$3.35 an hour since January 1981 in a stalemate that lasted
throughout the Reagan administration. Democrats promised to
reconsider the issue before the 1992 presidential and congressional
elections.
   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland said organized labor would
``welcome the long overdue agreement on the minimum wage'' and
urged Congress to pass it swiftly.
   The compromise would boost the minimum wage to $3.80 on April 1
and provide the final 45-cent increase to $4.25 on April 1, 1991.
The subminimum wage, for workers age 16 to 19 in their first jobs,
would be 85 percent of the prevailing minimum wage except for in
the first year of the increase, for which lawmakers added a
provision barring it from being below the current $3.35 an hour
minimum. The subminimum would be $3.61 when the minimum wage rose
to $4.25.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the Senate Labor
Committee, said the minimum wage would already be $4.79 an hour if
adjusted to account for inflation since 1981.
   ``That is the measure of how far we have failed the test of
fairness to the working poor,'' Kennedy said. ``Our only answer to
them is that this is the best compromise we can get from an
administration that wanted to give them even less.''
   The subminimum wage could be paid to any worker age 16 to 19
with less than three months total job experience. Once that
threshold was met, the subminimum could be paid for up to an
additional three months only when the employer had a training
program subject to Labor Department approval.
   No worker over age 20 or with six months' work experience could
be paid the subminimum wage, and the lower wage would expire in
April 1993 unless reauthorized by Congress.
   Democrats and labor long have considered such a ``training
wage'' unacceptable. However, it became clear that some such
provision would be necessary to strike a deal with the White House
or to achieve a veto-proof majority in the House.
   For his part, Bush gave up nine months from his offer to
increase the minimum wage to $4.25 in January 1992, and he also
conceded ground on the training wage. He had demanded a six-month
provision for all workers regardless of their age and prior work
experience.

<HEAD>1990 Lincoln Town Car: Huge But Easy To Handle</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto, LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Don't let the rounded edges on the 1990 Lincoln Town Car
disappoint you over the shrinking of true, unabashed American
luxury cars. The Town Car is still a monster.
   Indeed, this year's model is an inch longer and has a third of
an inch more wheelbase than the 1989 model. The rounded,
aerodynamic styling, borrowed from the Ford Taurus and Lincoln
Continental, just makes the new Town Car look slightly smaller.
   Once you're inside, however, you'll get the familiar
all-American picture: wide, pillow-soft seats, legroom ample for
even the Jolly Green Giant, and built-in comfort at every turn. The
carmaker boasts that the trunk, at 22 cubic feet, is the biggest in
the industry.
   The truth is, the redesigned 1990 Town Car, which had its last
major overhaul in 1979, isn't much of a departure from the previous
model, save for some smoothing of body panels and some fine-tuning
of handling features.
   For example, the test vehicle, a Cartier four-door model,
handled well despite its length of more than 18 feet, 4 inches. The
vehicle tackled winding mountain roads with remarkable ease, with
far less sway than might be expected, thanks to the addition of
rear air-spring load leveling and speed-sensitive, variable-assist
power steering.
   Inside, the ride was cushioned, as always; road bumps were
nearly imperceptible. The most I noticed were a couple of slight
jostlings on particularly rigorous roads and a bucking sensation a
couple of times.
   The 5-liter, V-8 engine, teamed with four-speed automatic
transmission with automatic overdrive, delivered good acceleration
even though it had to power more than 4,000 pounds of car (that's
about equal to the weight of two Hyundai Excel subcompacts).
   Fuel economy was rated at 17 mpg in the city and 24 mpg on the
highway, but in hard driving in the city and on the highway the
test car averaged 15.7 mpg.
   Safety items included standard driver and front-passenger
airbags, optional Traction-Lok axle ($101) that protects against
spinouts by keeping both tires rotating at the same speed even if
one loses traction on ice or sand, and optional antilock brakes.
These brakes, by the way, were excellent in panic stops, bringing
this huge car to a steady, controlled halt. But that option costs
$936.
   A less expensive option will save cold-weather drivers from
straddling the front of the car to scrape ice off the big
windshield. Ford offers Insta-Clear, a windshield that clears ice
with the touch of a dashboard button. It does this without the
windshield wires common to rear window defrosters. The only sign of
Insta-Clear is the window's pinkish tinge, from the addition of
special heat-conductive material. The cost is $253.
   Ford added other nice touches: a label and an arrow under the
dashboard fuel gauge indicating the side of the car with the gas
cap so you know how to pull up to the pumps; a button to open the
gas tank located on the dashboard rather than under or beside the
driver's seat; big handles on all four doors and on the backs of
the front seats to help entry and exit, and stereo speakers above
the front-door armrests that are so integrated into the design you
don't notice them.
   The Town Car also had the most powerful lumbar support of any
car I've tested. I was able to pressurize the system to the point I
felt I had a huge rock in the middle of my back.
   The major drawback to the Town Car is price. It starts at
$27,986 this model year, up 9.5 percent from the $25,562 starting
price in the 1989 model year, according to company spokesmen. The
upscale test car had a base price of $32,809. With options and
destination charge, it came to nearly $35,000.
   But the hefty price has not deterred more than 100,000 buyers in
recent years. More than 84,000 have been sold so far this year.
Ford Motor Co. expects the new styling to help boost sales from
121,674 in 1988 to 135,000 total in 1990.
   The new rounded look may help lure slightly younger buyers.
Spokesman Jim Trainor says previous Town Car buyers had an average
age of 59.8 years and household income of $58,800 annually.
   Seventy-four percent of buyers have been men, and 86 percent are
married, he says.
   Main competitors for the Town Car include the Cadillac Fleetwood
Brougham, which starts at $27,400, and the Cadillac Sedan DeVille,
which starts at $27,540.
   Consumer Reports magazine ranked 1982-86 model Town Cars as
average or above average in its trouble index, according to owner
reports.
   The 1987 Town Car dropped to worse than average in the trouble
index, a ranking that Trainor says baffles the company because the
magazine's list of specific trouble spots such as air conditioning,
fuel system and brakes ranked average across the board.

   The stock market drifted in a narrow range today
after Tuesday's rally faded.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 41.60 on Tuesday,
dropped back 9.42 points to 2,635.66 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers slightly outnumbered losers in nationwide trading of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 740 up, 688 down and 508
unchanged.
   Stock prices in general got a lift Tuesday from news of a
takeover bid by Georgia-Pacific for Great Northern Nekoosa.
   Analysts said the news was taken as reassurance that merger and
acquisition activity wasn't going to disappear as a result of
recent problems involving several debt-financed buyout plans.
   Nekoosa shares, up 20[ on Tuesday, slipped back 1] to 61{ in
active trading today.
   At the same time, analysts said, worries persisted about the
numerous disappointments that showed up in corporate earnings for
the third quarter of the year.
   Those reports prompted talk of a possible significant slowdown
in the economy, and downward revisions of profit projections for
the rest of this year and early 1990.
   Georgia Gulf gained 1] to 50~. NL Industries, which holds a
stake of just under 10 percent of the company, offered to buy the
rest of the stock for $50 a share.
   Losers among the blue chips included American Express, down } at
35|; International Business Machines, down { at 99}; McDonald's,
down \ at 30}, and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, down { at 43}.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.02 to 188.26. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 1.13 at 371.71.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 129.13 million shares with an

Reupke, has resigned to ``pursue other interests.''
   Reupke, 52, was appointed general manager in May. He previously
was editor-in-chief, a post he assumed in 1978.
   Reupke's responsibilities as general manager, traditionally the
second in command to Chairman and Chief Executive Glen Renfrew,

   One is Patrick Mannix, formerly international technical manager,
who was named a director of group quality programs and to

   Futures prices of grain and soybeans closed
higher Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade, ending a three-day
decline amid expectations for new export business and continued
dryness in winter wheat country.
   The markets opened lower on talk that the Soviet Union was
considering delaying the delivery of some of its recently purchased
U.S. corn, but prices turned higher at midday as rumors of pending
grain business with Far Eastern nations surfaced.
   Wheat futures got an additonal boost from reports of fairly dry

forecasts.
   A report from private grain traders in Buenos Aires estimating
1989-90 Argentine planted corn acreage at the lowest level of this
century ``could be a long-term supportive factor,'' said Joel

   At the close of trading, wheat futures prices were 1{ cents to

   Japanese investors have pumped another $701
million into the U.S. mortgage market through two new mutual funds
that invest primarily in Fannie Mae mortgage-backed securities, it
was announced Wednesday.
   Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. is lead manager and investment adviser of
the new funds, which resemble a $575 million fund announced in June
by the Blackstone Group, Salomon Brothers Inc. and Goldman, Sachs.
The Blackstone Fund was the first tailored to attracting Japanese
money to the U.S. mortgage market.
   The funds indirectly help Americans buy homes by increasing the
pool of money available for mortgages, David O. Maxwell, chairman
and chief executive of the Federal National Mortgage Association,
or Fannie Mae, said in a statement.
   Fannie Mae buys home mortgage loans from the original issuers
and repackages some of them as mortgage-backed securities, which
are sold to the public. Investors get the flow of principal and
interest payments from the underlying loans. Fannie Mae currently
has $209 billion in mortgage-backed securities outstanding.
   Goldman, Sachs' partner in managing the offering was Japan's
Daiwa Securities Co.

<HEAD>Third Jury Hears GAF Stock Manipulation Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KILEY ARMSTRONG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After two mistrials, the stock manipulation case
against GAF Corp. and a top executive opened Wednesday for a third
time.
   The new jury was not told that U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson
Lowe had declared mistrials on Jan. 10 and March 22 in the case
against the Wayne, N.J.-based chemicals and building materials
manufacturer and its vice chairman, James T. Sherwin.
   Arthur L. Liman, lead attorney for GAF, addressed the 12-member
panel in federal court in Manhattan after an hour-long opening
statement by Assistant U.S. Attorney Carl Loewenson Jr.
   Loewenson told the jury that Sherwin persuaded a Los Angeles
brokerage firm to illegally drive up Union Carbide Corp.'s stock
price in October 1986 so that GAF _ which had accumulated 10
million shares in a failed takeover bid _ could unload it at a
better price.
   Liman denied GAF was desperate to get rid of the stock. He said
GAF Chairman and Chief Executive Samuel J. Heyman was ``very
bullish, very optimistic'' about the future of Union Carbide.
   Liman said the government's case depends on the testimony of an
admitted felon, Los Angeles stockbroker Boyd L. Jefferies, who has
been testifying as part of a plea arrangement.
   Jefferies has testified twice that Sherwin induced him to
manipulate the stock and to hide the transaction.
   ``You have the power to keep Boyd Jefferies from pulling the
wool over your eyes and from perpetrating any misjustice,'' Liman
said.
   The lawyer claimed Jefferies has rehearsed his testimony at
least 25 times with government lawyers. ``The only thing they
didn't do is have him practice in front of a mirror,'' he said.
   Loewenson conceded there will be inconsistencies in the
testimony of Jefferies and his chief trader, James Melton. If their
recollections matched perfectly, he told the jury, ``you'd know
that they cooked up a story together.''
   GAF, two subsidiaries and Sherwin were indicted in July 1988 on
charges of securities fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy.
   The companies would face maximum fines totaling $12 million, or
$500,000 on each of eight counts against each of the three. Sherwin
would face 40 years in prison and a fine of up to $2 million.
   The GAF case was the first criminal trial stemming from the
insider trading scandals of the mid-1980s and were considered a
critical test of information supplied by jailed stock speculator
Ivan F. Boesky.
   Jefferies was implicated in the scandal by Boesky and pleaded
guilty to two securities fraud felonies. Earlier this year,
Jefferies was sentenced to probation and fined $250,000.

   The Los Angeles Herald Examiner, once the
nation's largest afternoon newspaper but recently just a scrappy
shell of its former self, said Wednesday it would cease publication
Thursday.
   Robert Danzig, vice president and general manager of Herald
Newspapers, made the announcement at an emotional meeting in the
newsroom Wednesday afternoon.
   The Herald Examiner, founded by William Randolph Hearst in 1903
as the Los Angeles Examiner, was put up for sale by Hearst Corp.
earlier this summer.
   Hearst cited ``intense pressure'' from the Los Angeles Times,
the city's dominant daily with five times the Herald's daily
circulation.
   The Herald, which in recent years had switched to morning
publication, also had to wrestle with increasingly successful
suburban papers like The Orange County Register, based in Santa
Ana, and the Los Angeles Daily News, based in the San Fernando
Valley.
   In its dying days, the Herald covered local politics
aggressively, breaking a number of stories on embattled Mayor Tom
Bradley that occasionally embarrassed the Times.
   While the Herald provided little staff-produced coverage of
Washington or international affairs, the paper's entertainment
coverage, sports columnists and local reporting were highly
regarded.
   The Times claims a daily circulation of 1,119,840 while the
Herald, which had a circulation of 729,000 in 1967, slumped to
238,392 daily, according to figures compiled by the Audit Bureau of
Circulations.

<HEAD>Importation of Once-Banned Products Worries Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED McCULLOUGH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 730 products whose
importation was barred to protect domestic industry now may enter
Argentina in a move the government hopes will spur competition and
keep a lid on inflation.
   The products include dishes, plates and other glass and pottery
products; leather suitcases; rugs, tapestries, wools, linen and
other textiles; books, watches, shoes, motorcycles, watches.
   Some of the products, though no longer banned, will still face
tariffs.
   About 70 products remain barred from importation, including
automobiles, sugar and pharmaceuticals. Computer and electronic
products remain protected by high tariffs.
   The lifting of import prohibitions was part of an agreement with
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund by which they
will loan Argentina money.
   ``The political and economic conditions that existed when
administrative restrictions were put on the importation (of the
products) have changed,'' Economy Minister Nestor Rapanelli said
Tuesday.
   ``The prohibition of importation is an instrument of protection
... that should be used only when strictly necessary,'' he said.
   The opening shows President Carlos Menem's determination to spur
growth in an economy beset by recession, unemployment, inflation
and inefficiency.
   The re-introduction of foreign goods in a national market that
had excluded them was expected to pressure domestic industries to
match them in terms of price and quality.
   Producers, however, said they feared they cannot compete and
win, and foreign goods will swamp local production, leading to
plant closings and layoffs.
   The policy of severely restricting imports dates to the
presidencies of Juan Domingo Peron in the late 1940s and early
1950s.

   The House voted overwhelmingly Wednesday to
raise the hourly minimum wage from $3.35 to $4.25 by April 1991 and
create a new, lower wage for teen-agers with less than six months
work experience.
   The 382-37 vote on the compromise struck between President Bush
and congressional Democrats sends the measure to the Senate, where
leaders have promised to pass it before Thanksgiving.
   Bush's signature then would trigger the first increase in the
minimum wage since January 1981 and end an eight-year political
stalemate between the majority Democrats in Congress and two
successive Republican administrations.
   That stalemate has kept the minimum wage at $3.35 an hour since
January 1981. The compromise provides a 45-cent increase to $3.80
next April 1 and another 45-cent jump a year later.
   It also creates for the first time a subminimum ``training
wage'' that would allow employers to pay workers from 16-19 years
old 85 percent of the prevailing minimum wage for their three
months in the work force. The subminimum could be paid for an
additional three months provided the youths were in certified
training programs.
   Beneficiaries of the compromise will be the roughly 4 million
Americans who, according to government figures, work at the minimum
wage. Congressional researchers say two-thirds of them are women
and between 25 percent and 33 percent of them are heads of
households. Eleven states have laws mandating minimum wages higher
than the current federal floor; a few of them already are at the
$4.25 level.
   The agreement on the subminimum, an anathema to organized labor
that was demanded by Bush, cleared the way for the compromise and
was the focus of most of the House debate.
   That debate was short and subdued, with lawmakers from both
parties finding fault with the compromise; most Democrats said the
increase was too small, while conservative Republicans said there
should no boost and for that matter no minimum wage.
   But gone was the acrimony and political posturing that
characterized the fight just months ago over a bill Bush ultimately
vetoed and the bitter debates on the subject during each of the
eight years of the Reagan administration.
   ``This will have to be our best, our pitiful best,'' said Rep.
Joseph M. Gaydos, D-Pa. ``We're not really being fair to those 8
million Americans who work at the minimum wage. ... This is indeed
a bitter pill to swallow.''
   The Republican floor manager of the bill, Pennsylvania Rep.
William Goodling, said: ``No one got exactly what they wanted. I
think we got the best that we could.''
   Voting in favor of the compromise were 247 Democrats and 135
Republicans. Two Democrats, Carl Perkins of Kentucky and George
Miller of Calfornia, both vocal opponents of the new subminimum
wage, voted against the plan, as did 35 Republicans. The rest of
the lawmakers did not vote.
   Perkins, who supported the bill Bush vetoed in June, said he
couldn't vote for the compromise because of the subminimum wage,
which covers 16- to 19-year-olds with fewer than six months work
experience.
   Bush insisted on such a ``training wage.'' Although the
compromise falls well short of what Bush initially demanded,
Perkins called the measure ``a sellout to the president of the
United States, who has indeed got his victory.''
   ``What we are talking about today is a step backwards for the
American worker and all those who believe that work should be
rewarded,'' Perkins said.
   Most speakers toned down their rhetoric, praising lawmakers for
their persistent work on the compromise.
   ``The political debate is over,'' said Rep. Thomas Ridge, R-Pa.,
who was among the moderate Republicans urging the White House to
compromise.
   ``You can't buy more bread or put another pair of shoes on the
young ones with good intentions,'' Ridge told Democrats who wanted
a larger increase.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., attributed Bush's sudden
willingness to compromise to pressure from Republican lawmakers
uncomfortable with the minimum-wage stalemate while Bush is pushing
a capital gains tax cut for the wealthy.
   ``To be very difficult and parsimonious with the least well-paid
Americans while generous to a fault _ underline to a fault _ with
the highest income people in the country was one that was
embarrassing Republicans,'' Foley told reporters.
   To strike the deal, Democrats agreed to push back the effective
dates of the increases from January to April, accept the subminimum
wage and drop their insistence on a commission to make annual
recommendations on the wage level, a mechanism Republicans said
would have been used to seek annual increases.
   Bush agreed to reaching the $4.25 level nine months earlier than
he had proposed and a far more restrictive subminimum wage than he
sought in what until Friday the administration had insisted was the
president's ``first, best and final offer.''
   Bush had proposed a six-month subminimum that could be paid to
all workers, regardless of age, every time they changed jobs.

<TEXT>
   A trust established by Manville Corp. to handle
legal liabilities arising from its abestos products says it was
considering several options to avoid a cash shortfall next year.
   In a filing Tuesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
the Manville Personal Injury Trust Fund said a portion of Manville
stock holdings could be sold or Manville recapitalized, among other
things.
   Trust officials announced last week that the trust was facing a
cash crunch that could delay payments to thousands of asbestos
victims by as much as 25 years.
   The trust was established last year to assume all legal
liabilities arising from asbestos produced by Manville and to
enable the company to emerge from federal bankruptcy protection.
Its initial funding consisted of $530 million from Manville's
insurance companies and $155 million from Manville.
   Currently, the trust owns 50 percent of Manville's common stock.
It also has the option of converting a block of Manville preferred
stock into common stock, which would give the trust ownership of 80
percent of Manville's common stock.
   Manville has offered to repurchase $500 million of the preferred
stock if the trust would agree to relax certain financial and
operational constraints on the company.
   Manville filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter
11 of federal bankruptcy laws in 1982 after facing a flood of
personal injury lawsuits arising from its former status as the
nation's largest asbestos producer. It now produces building
products and packaging materials.

   The dollar ended higher Wednesday against key
currencies in thin trading after falling overseas.
   Gold prices declined. On the Commodity Exchange in New York,
gold bullion for current delivery closed at $374.20 a troy ounce,
down 50 cents from late Tuesday. Republic National Bank of New York
quoted a late bid for gold of $372.90 an ounce, down 45 cents.
   Currency dealers said technical factors within the market were
largely responsible for supporting the dollar Wednesday, although
reports of an earthquake in Japan may also have helped the dollar
at the expense of the Japanese yen.
   ``It was more related to the technical market factors and the
earthquake was a catalyst to create movement,'' said Trevor
Woodland, chief corporate trader for Harris Trust &amp; Co. in Chicago.
   The U.S. Geological Survey reported that a major earthquake
registering 7.3 on the Richter scale struck off the northeast coast
of Japan's Honshu Island. It reportedly occurred in the same
general area as a series of earlier tremors during the past several
weeks.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose to 143.08 yen from 142.15 yen at Tuesday's
close. It traded at 143.45 yen in London, and at 143.80 yen in New
York, up from 142.87 yen Tuesday.
   Trading in Europe was quieter than usual Wednesday, with markets
in Italy, Spain, France and Belgium closed for the All Saints Day
holiday. In West Germany, only banks in Frankfurt and northern
Germany were open.
   The dollar was mixed against the British pound. Sterling rose to
$1.5815 from $1.5775 in London, but it fell to $1.5755 from $1.5805
in New York.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Tuesday's quotes, included: 1.8505 West German marks, up from
1.8420; 1.6260 Swiss francs, up from 1.6160; 6.2740 French francs,
up from 6.2510; 1.1742 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1740; and
1,358.75 Italian lire, up from 1,352.50.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday,
included: 1.8377 West German marks, down from 1.8410; 1.6132 Swiss
francs, down from 1.6142; 6.2305 French francs, down from 6.2445;

   Gold fell in London to a late bid of $374.25 an ounce from
$377.75 late Tuesday. In Zurich, Switzerland, gold traded at
$373.40 an ounce, down from $375.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold slipped $2.92 to close at $373.87 an
ounce.
   Silver prices were lower. On New York's Comex, silver bullion

<HEAD>Energy Secretary Says Natural Gas Industry `On A Roll'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Natural gas has gone from being almost exotic to
an abundant, cheap source of clean fuel that plays an important
part in the nation's energy policy, Energy Secretary James D.
Watkins said Wednesday.
   ``It was wrong for us to write off natural gas in the 1970s,''
Watkins told the American Gas Association in its annual meeting.
``It would be equally wrong for us to look at natural gas, or any
fuel, as more than a component of our comprehensive energy
strategy.''
   Association members have lauded natural gas as an answer to
problems surrounding oil, mainly foreign imports and environmental
worries.
   Much attention has been paid to various programs using natural
gas, especially as a replacement for gasoline in powering vehicles
and for co-generation of electricity, areas Watkins highlighted
Wednesday in an industry he said was ``really on a roll.''
   ``Twelve years ago, in DOE's formative years, natural gas was
viewed as a scarce and dwindling resource,'' Watkins said. ``Today
we know natural gas can be a clean-burning, domestically abundant
fuel.''
   He said the department estimates that the nation has a 35-year
supply at prices of $3 per thousand cubic feet.

<HEAD>Georgia-Pacific Seeks Support for Great Northern Takeover</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY HARKAVY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Georgia-Pacific Corp. moved Wednesday to
muster support for its $3.13 billion takeover offer for Great
Northern Nekoosa Co., suggesting it could improve productivity and
stem the decline of Great Northern's Maine paper mills.
   Separately, Great Northern's board of directors held its
regularly scheduled meeting Wednesday at company headquarters in
Norwalk, Conn., but took no action on the tender offer, said
Stephen Hill, director of investor relations.
   Georgia-Pacific representatives fanned out across Maine to
promote the $58 a share proposal that if successful would create a
paper company owning more than 2.6 million acres.
   ``Our record of growth in the industry is a very clear record.
We are a very efficient, low-cost producer of what are very clearly
commodity products,'' said C.T. ``Kip'' Howlett Jr.,
Georgia-Pacific vice president for governmental affairs.
   Noting recent layoffs at Great Northern's mills in Millinocket
and East Millinocket, Howlett said there was ``a lot of potential
for improvement.'' Howlett didn't mention specifics but suggested
his company would introduce a more varied product mix, adding
fiberboard and structural wood paneling to the current output of
newsprint and groundwood papers.
   Great Northern stock, which soared $20.12{ on news of the buyout
offer Tuesday, dipped $1.37{ to $61.50 a share in heavy New York
Stock Exchange trading Wednesday.
   Great Northern's board of directors said Tuesday it would study
the unsolicited offer ``in due course'' before deciding on a
response.
   Workers in the Millinocket-area mills and across Great
Northern's 2.1 million acres of Maine timberlands received letters
from their employer saying it was moving ahead with business as
usual.
   The company, which has a pulp and paper mill in the Millinocket
area 80 miles north of Bangor in northern Maine, has 2,800 Maine
employees.
   Although it has stressed that it regarded the buyout offer as
friendly, Georgia Pacific has filed a U.S. District Court complaint
in Portland challenging Maine's anti-takeover law.
   Great Northern is incorporated in Maine. State law requires an
acquirer to wait five years before completing a merger unless the
deal wins prior approval from directors of the target company.
   Atlanta-based Georgia-Pacific also asked the court to throw out
several anti-takeover provisions in Great Northern's by-laws.
   In Augusta, the takeover bid dominated a State House news
briefing that followed a meeting between Gov. John R. McKernan and
leaders of the paperworkers' union.
   ``At this point, we don't know enough (about the implications)
to know what is in our best interests,'' said McKernan.
   McKernan had arranged the meeting, which was scheduled before
the takeover bid was made public, to discuss Great Northern's
tentative plan to build a new $484 million paper mill in a joint
venture with a West German papermaker.
   Edward Gorham of the Maine AFL-CIO, who attended the meeting,
said Great Northern had been reluctant to discuss whether displaced
union workers would be given the first shot at jobs in the new mill.
   He said labor leaders were waiting to see how a takeover would
affect that project, although he said ``there's not much cause for
optimism'' and that past Georgia-Pacific takeovers have led to
mills being shut down.
   McKernan said he had talked with officials from both companies
but got little information from either because ``everything is sort
of up in the air.''
   ``Great Northern has said they're continuing business as usual
until their board of directors tells them to do otherwise, which
means they will continue to move forward in their plans for the
expansion,'' he said.
   ``The people at Georgia-Pacific have said, obviously, they
haven't had a chance to look at the company in enough detail so
that if they were successful in their tender offer, that they would
be able to make any commitments.''
   McKernan said he stressed to both sides that he considered
construction of the new mill essential, regardless of who owned or
operated it.

   The stock market chalked up some uneven gains
Wednesday, struggling to maintain the momentum of Tuesday's rally.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which climbed 41.60 on
Tuesday, edged up .82 to 2,645.90.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
847 up, 644 down and 476 unchanged.
   Stock prices in general got a lift Tuesday from news of a
takeover bid by Georgia-Pacific for Great Northern Nekoosa.
   Analysts said the news was taken as reassurance that merger and
acquisition activity wasn't going to disappear as a result of
recent problems involving several debt-financed buyout plans.
   Nekoosa shares, after soaring 20[ on Tuesday, slipped back 1] to
61{ as the most active Big Board issue.
   At the same time, analysts said, worries persisted about the
numerous disappointments that showed up in corporate earnings for
the third quarter of the year.
   Those reports prompted talk of a possible significant slowdown
in the economy, and downward revisions of profit projections for
the rest of this year and early 1990.
   The next key item on the market agenda is expected to be
Friday's report from the Labor Department on the employment
situation for October.
   Advance estimates on Wall Street call for an increase in nonfarm
payroll employment of somewhere between 100,000 and 150,000, down
from 209,000 in September.
   Campbell Soup jumped 3] to 47[. Word of the resignation of
Gordon McGovern as president and chief executive stirred revived
takeover talk about the company.
   Georgia Gulf gained 1} to 51\. NL Industries, which holds a
stake of just under 10 percent of the company, offered to buy the
rest of the stock for $50 a share.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Philip Morris rose [ to 43[,
but International Business Machines dropped \ to 100; Ford Motor
fell \ to 47[; McDonald's lost [ to 30~, and American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph was down \ at 44.
   GenCorp dropped 2 to 14. The company said its fourth-quarter
earnings from continuing operations would be down significantly
from comparable levels a year ago.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 154.24 million
shares, against 176.10 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 183.77 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $9.69 billion, or 0.29
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .60 to 188.84.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose .88 to 389.42, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was up .84 at 341.20.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market

<HEAD>Philip Morris Plans Corporate Ad Campaign Tied to Bill of Rights</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Philip Morris Cos. Inc., whose cigarette unit
has championed smokers' rights, on Wednesday launched a
corporate-image advertising campaign pegged to the 200th
anniversary of the Bill of Rights.
   The campaign includes ads that put the Philip Morris name back
on television for the first time since it quit advertising its
namesake cigarette brand on TV in the 1950s.
   Broadcast advertising of cigarettes has been banned since 1971.
   The new commercials make no mention of cigarettes or smoking,
and Philip Morris executives said they never will. The ads simply
list at the close the company's name and those of its three
operating subsidiaries, which include the Philip Morris U.S.A.
cigarette concern, its Kraft General Foods packaged goods company
and its Miller Brewing Co.
   But anti-smoking campaigners criticized the new ads anyway.
   ``It's just another attempt by the tobacco companies to
associate themselves with wholesome innocent images like youth,
athletics and the arts,'' said Steve Dickinson, a spokesman for the
American Cancer Society.
   The ads, which were launched in print and on television
Wednesday morning, invite people to call a toll-free telephone
number if they want a free copy of the Bill of Rights _ the first
10 amendments to the Constitution.
   Guy L. Smith IV, vice president for corporate affairs at Philip
Morris, said there were 5,000 calls in the first hour after the
commercial appeared on the morning news shows Wednesday.
   Philip Morris is expected to spend $30 million a year on the
two-year campaign, including costs of placing the ads on television
and in newspapers and magazines as well as mailing the requested
documents to callers.
   Smith said Philip Morris decided to launch its first corporate
campaign partly to show people that the company has grown
considerably in the past few years, particularly with its
acquisitions of General Foods and Kraft.
   It now owns the nation's largest food company, the largest
tobacco company and the second largest beer company.
   Its products include Marlboro cigarettes, Miller beer, Jell-O
desserts, Kraft cheese and salad dressings and Maxwell House
coffee. The Philip Morris cigarette brand has been renamed and is
called Commander.
   The ads are tied in with the National Archives' observance of
the 200th anniversary of the Bill of Rights.
   Jill Brett, an archives spokeswoman, said Philip Morris is
handling distribution of requested copies of the Bill of Rights and
other materials the archives has prepared and may underwrite a
national tour connected to the anniversary.
   She said the archives wanted to reach as many people as it could
with an educational campaign about the Bill of Rights and felt
Philip Morris had a track record for supporting cultural
institutions and the arts.
   ``We look at it as an opportunity to reach millions of Amricans
we could not reach otherwise without corporate support,'' she said.
   Marketing consultant Al Ries of Trout &amp; Ries in Greenwich,
Conn., said Philip Morris must have been mindful of increasing
threats of more regulation of the tobacco industry when it decided
to tout the Bill of Rights in ads.
   ``They are hoping that people will look at their ads and say to
themselves maybe smokers should have rights too,'' Ries said.
   Michael Pertschuk, the former head of the Federal Trade
Commission who was involved as a Senate staffer in the efforts to
ban broadcast advertising of tobacco products in 1971, said the
Philip Morris ads are ``an attempt to legitimize itself as an
institution'' by associating the company ``with those things that
are American and holy.''
   ``That would be fine for a company that sold a product that is
wholesome and decent, but it's not fine for a company that still
spends billions of dollars to promote and aggressively market a
product that kills hundreds of thousands of people,'' he said.

<HEAD>Sugar Futures Leap On Brazilian Supply Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Sugar futures prices exploded to 15{-month highs Wednesday on
New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange on news that Brazil, the
world's fourth-largest producer, was considering suspending sugar
exports.
   On other futures markets, coffee futures sank; pork bellies
continued to surge; copper advanced; precious metals slipped; oil
futures rallied; grains and soybeans rose; and stock-index futures
advanced.
   World sugar futures settled .45 cent to .56 cent higher in New
York with the contract for delivery in March at 14.53 cents a
pound, the highest settlement of a near-month sugar contract since
July 19, 1988.
   Brazilian authorities said they were studying the possibility of
suspending sugar exports from the country's 1989-90 sugar cane crop
but had made no decision.
   Analysts said Brazil might halt exports to divert more sugar
cane into production of alcohol for automobile fuel. Most of
Brazil's passenger cars burn alcohol.
   Earlier this year, the Brazilian Sugar and Alcohol Institute
projected production of 6.9 million metric tons of raw sugar for
the 1989-90 crop year, which began in September, with 645,000
metric tons earmarked for export.
   Last year, Brazil produced 8 million metric tons of sugar and
exported about 1.5 million.
   ``This situation is pretty severe,'' said Judith Ganes, an
analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York. ``It remains
to be seen whether they are going to be able to meet their sugar
export commitments.''
   Coffee futures sank in New York amid fading prospects for a
return to export quotas, which were lifted in July, precipitating a
sharp drop in coffee prices.
   Green, unroasted coffee settled 1.6 cents to 2.31 cents lower
with December at 72.45 cents a pound.
   Pork-belly futures soared the permitted limit of 2 cents a pound
for the second consecutive day on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
amid expectations for new export demand.
   Hog futures rose sharply in line with the bellies while cattle
futures were mostly lower.
   Live cattle settled .05 cent to .25 cent lower with December at
74.27 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .15 cent lower
with November at 83.12 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent to 1.08
cents higher with December at 47.65 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were 2 cents higher across the board with February at 57.60
cents a pound.
   Near-month copper futures rose sharply on New York's Commodity
Exchange following news of an unexpectedly large 426-ton decline
Tuesday in the exchange's warehouse inventories.
   Copper settled 0.9 cent lower to 2.5 cents higher with December
at $1.165 a pound.
   Gold and silver futures slid lower on the Comex. Gold settled 70
cents to 90 cents lower with December at $376.90 a troy ounce;
silver was 3 cent lower across the board with December at $5.188 a
troy ounce.
   The surging heating oil market pulled energy futures higher for
the second straight day on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   The rally was rooted in the American Petroleum Institute's
report late Tuesday of an unexpected 1.31 million-barrel drawdown
last week in U.S. stocks of petroleum distillates.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 13 cents to 19 cents
higher with December at $20.07 cents a barrel; heating oil was .06
cent to 1.25 cents higher with December at 60.36 cents gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .05 cent lower to .11 cent higher with
December at 52.89 cents a gallon.
   Grain and soybean futures rose on the Chicago Board of Trade,
ending a three-day decline amid expectations for new export
business and continued dryness in winter wheat country.
   Wheat futures settled 1{ cents to 3{ cents higher with December
at $3.98 a bushel; corn was unchanged to 2 cents higher with
December at $2.37{ a bushel; oats were } cent to 1 cent higher with
December at $1.43{ a bushel; soybeans were \ cent to 4 cents higher
with November at $5.61} a bushel.
   Stock-index futures were mostly higher on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for December delivery of stocks in the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index settled .15 cent higher at 343.30. Each
point is worth $500.

<HEAD>Tentative Deal Reached in Sony-Warner Battle Over Superproducers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sony Corp. and Warner Communications Inc.
have reached a tentative agreement allowing Hollywood's hottest
producers, Peter Guber and Jon Peters, to jump to Sony's Columbia
Pictures, a source close to the negotiations said Wednesday.
   ``There's still a number of T's to be crossed, but it looks like
a done deal,'' said the source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``It's going to cost Sony some.''
   The settlement would allow Guber and Peters, producers of such
hit films as ``Batman'' and ``Rain Man,'' to break their five-year
contract with Warner Bros. to head Columbia Pictures Entertainment.
   In a key part of the proposed settlement, Warner would receive
Columbia's 35 percent share in The Burbank Studios, the 150-acre
lot they jointly own, in exchange for the old MGM lot in Culver
City, which Warner acquired in its merger with Lorimar Telepictures
this year.
   Warner Bros. Records also would get a share of Sony's lucrative
CBS Record Club, which Sony acquired as part of its buyout of CBS
Records.
   Warner is nation's leading record company in the country,
followed by CBS. But Warner has no record club of its own and has
contracted with the CBS club and the old RCA club, now owned by
Germany's Bertelsmann Music Group, to provide records to members of
those clubs.
   Warner also would retain rights to the projects Guber and Peters
have under way or in development at Warner. Those include two
sequels to ``Batman,'' which already has grossed nearly $250
million at U.S. theaters.
   Warner, a unit of Time Warner Inc., says it already has invested
or committed $13 million in 50 projects under development by Guber
and Peters.
   Warner and Sony spokesmen declined comment.
   The loss of Guber and Peters would have scrambled Sony's
management plans for Columbia, to which it has made a $5 billion
commitment. In addition to buying Columbia for $3.4 billion, Sony
is paying $200 million for Guber-Peters Entertainment and will
assume payments on $1.5 billion in Columbia debt.
   Warner, on the other hand, stood to gain little by forcing Guber
and Peters to stay on if in doing so it only angered its star
producers.
   Both sides agreed Tuesday to postpone a court hearing Thursday
on Warner's request for an injunction barring Guber and Peters from
leaving, saying they needed time ``to allow the parties to have
further discussions.''
   The two producers contended Warner had an oral agreement to let
them out of their contract if they got the chance to run a major
studio. But Warner Bros. President Terry Semel denied that.
   ``I do not make oral agreements to terminate written agreements,
especially when they involve key talent and millions of dollars,''
Semel said in one of a series of affidavits filed in preparation
for the scheduled court hearing Thursday.

   Energy futures prices finished mostly higher
Wednesday, led by a surge in heating oil prices.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, heating oil for December
delivery climbed 1.25 cents to 60.36 cents a gallon, while the
January contract rose 1.02 cents to 59.95 a gallon.
   Analysts said bullish weekly statistics from the American
Petroleum Institute and colder weather across the country
contributed to the increase.
   The latest API report showed that heating oil inventories fell
1.3 million barrels last week to 118.7 million barrels.
   Crude oil futures traded on the exchange also rose. The December
contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. grade of
crude, rose 13 cents to finish at $20.07 per 42-gallon barrel.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for December delivery declined 0.05
cent to 52.89 cents a gallon, and the January contract advanced
0.11 cent to 52.71 cents.
   Analysts said crude prices gained despite an 8 million-barrel
increase in crude supplies to 344.5 million barrels, according to
API.
   ``It was a correction from last week when crude stocks fell by
about the same amount,'' said Richard Redoglio, energy broker with
Merrill Lynch Energy Futures.
   Total gasoline supplies rose by 8,000 barrels, the API report
showed.

<HEAD>NL Makes $50-a-Share Offer for Georgia Gulf</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NL Industries Inc. renewed its courtship of
Georgia Gulf Corp. on Wednesday, disclosing it had made an
unsolicited $1.1 billion offer for the 90.1 percent stake in the
company it does not already own.
   Georgia Gulf said its board reviewed the NL Industries' proposal
as well as unspecified ``indications of interest from other third
parties'' about possible business combinations and would continue
to review its alternatives.
   ``No decision has been made to eliminate any alternatives from
consideration,'' Georgia Gulf said in a statement.
   It added that there can be no assurance that any transaction
will be recommended, authorized or completed.
   ``Discussions are being held with interested parties and work is
also continuing on other various transactions,'' the statement said.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Georgia Gulf stock
climbed $1.75 a share to $51.25.
   The offer NL Industries marked the first concrete proposal from
the company controlled by a Texas billionaire Harold C. Simmons,
but followed several overtures over the past few months.
   Simmons already owns about 9.9 percent of the chemical company's
25.6 million outstanding shares.
   John Garcia, an analyst with Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co. in New
York, said he viewed the offer as an attempt to drive up the price
of Georgia Gulf's stock.
   ``He saw some value and he wants to get a piece of it. He's a
moneymaker,'' Garcia said.
   NL President J. Landis Martin could not be reached for comment
Wednesday. He was out of his Houston office and did not return
messages left with his secretary.
   Simmons, through NL, has been buying and selling Georgia Gulf
stock since early summer.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in
August, he said his then nearly 10 percent stake in Georgia Gulf
was no longer held simply for investment purposes. In September, he
reduced his stake in Georgia Gulf to below 9 percent and said he
was temporarily dropping a bid to oust the company's board of
directors. Later that month, he again increased his holdings in the
company to 9.9 percent.
   The latest offer for the Atlanta company comes about six weeks
after Georgia Gulf officials met with NL's Martin to discuss a
possible merger.
   No agreement was reached, and Georgia Gulf then asked its
financial advisers to explore the feasibility of what it called ``a
variety of alternative transactions,'' including a deal with NL.
   Georgia Gulf, a chemical company created in 1985 by
Georgia-Pacific Corp., had 1988 sales of $1.06 billion. Analysts
have said previously that a takeover would be difficult without the
consent of Georgia Gulf management, which owns a substantial
portion of the company.

   Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc. said Wednesday that it was
extending until Nov. 9 its $576 million offer for the 33 percent of
the electronic financial information company Telerate Inc. that it
does not already own.
   It was the second extension in the $18-a-share offer in the past
week.
   A special panel of Telerate directors previously rejected the
offer as inadequate and urged Dow Jones to negotiate a mutually
acceptable deal.
   The two sides have met several times, although the terms of the
offer have not been changed.
   Last Friday, Dow Jones said it was extending its tender offer
until 5 p.m. EST next Monday, and the latest action extends it
another three days. The tender offer originally was to expire this
Friday.
   In a filing Wednesday with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Dow Jones said it was extending its offer because
Telerate had provided Dow Jones with a new forecast of financial
performance and Dow wants to review it.
   Peter Skinner, vice president and general counsel for Dow Jones,
said Telerate discussed the new forecast with Dow Jones at a
meeting Tuesday, and said he expects the two sides to meet again.
   In New York Stock Exchange trading, Telerate rose 12{ cents a
share to $19.50.
   Dow Jones publishes The Wall Street Journal, Barron's magazine
and provides a variety of financial news services and data bases.

<HEAD>Steinberg Seeks Approval to Buy More Than 15 Percent of UAL</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES WEBB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investor Saul Steinberg, who in recent months had
cut his stake in UAL Corp., filed Wednesday for federal approval to
purchase more than 15 percent of the parent of United Airlines.
   UAL announced that the filing was imminent, but refused to
comment further.
   A spokesman for New York-based Reliance Group Holdings Inc.,
which Steinberg chairs, confirmed that the company filed for
clearance with the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice
Department as required by federal antitrust law. But the spokesman
refused to comment further.
   Steinberg sold nearly 500,000 shares of UAL stock when it
rocketed to the $280-$290-per-share range following a buyout offer
by California billionaire Marvin Davis and the UAL board's
acceptance of a proposed $6.75 billion pilot-management bid.
   UAL stock plummeted more than $100 after the pilot-management
group failed to get financing for the deal. That announcement
helped to trigger an Oct. 13 stock market plunge.
   UAL stock closed $1{ higher at $177 Wednesday.
   Both Davis and the pilots have said they are exploring the
possibility of making a new bid.
   Kathie Hardin, a spokeswoman for the Air Line Pilots
Association, would not comment on the Reliance filing and refused
to say whether ALPA had been contacted by Reliance.
   Spokesmen for the International Association of Machinists, who
rebuffed Davis' latest advances, could not be reached for comment.
The Machinists refused to join the pilot-management buyout plan.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission Oct. 3,
Reliance said it had sold 499,000 shares of UAL common stock since
Sept. 5 for a total of $142.8 million. No reason for the sale was
given in the filing.
   The sale cut Steinberg's holding in UAL to 1.02 million shares,
or 4.7 percent. Previously he had held 6.99 percent of UAL's shares.
   An airline industry analyst said it was more likely that
Steinberg is looking to make a profit than maneuvering for a
takeover attempt.
   ``So far he's made a real lot of money,'' said Stephen Dexter,
of Kemper Financial Services Inc. in Chicago.
   ``Considering this fiasco we've just seen, Saul Steinberg may be
speculating that the board and (UAL Chairman) Steve Wolf are under
pressure to do something to reward shareholders,'' such as a
special dividend or a stock repurchase, Dexter said.

<HEAD>Campbell Soup Announces Early Retirement of President R. Gordon McGovern</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MELANIE BURNEY</BYLINE>
<UNK>Associated Press Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two months after announcing a worldwide
restructuring , Campbell Soup Co. said Wednesday that R. Gordon
McGovern, president and chief executive officer, plans to take an
early retirement.
   McGovern decided to step down for personal reasons, Robert J.
Vlasic, chairman of Campbell, said in a statement. McGovern had
been expected to retire in October 1991.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Campbell climbed
$3.37{ a share to $47.12{.
   But John M. McMillin, an analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc., said he was not surprised by the resignation. ``To
put it in baseball terms _ the team wasn't winning,'' McMillin said.
   In September, Campbell reported fiscal 1989 earnings of $13
million, down sharply from the previous year because of a $343
million corporate restructuring charge. The restructuring included
the closing of manufacturing plants in New Jersey, Maryland and
Tennessee with a loss of 2,800 jobs.
   The restructuring of the nation's largest soup maker came four
months after the death of John T. Dorrance Jr., the son of the
inventor of condensed soup, who hesitated to lay off workers or
close plants.
   ``It shows the powerful changes that are taking place within
Campbell Soups'' said McMillin.
   The board had clearly been unhappy with Campbell's performance
in recent years and last November, Vlasic was tapped for the
chairman slot over McGovern.
   ``The new shareholders as well as the old were somewhat
dissatisified,'' said McMillin. ``Whether he was fired or resigned
is a question of semantics.''
   The retirement is effective Nov. 15, two days before the
company's annual shareholders meeting. Analysts say shareholders
will move quickly to find sucessor for McGovern who joined
Campbell's Pepperidge Farm subsidiary in 1956 as a management
trainee in Downington, Pa.
   ``I think the board would feel comfortable in accepting the
resignation _ paving the road for new leadership,'' said Marvin B.
Roffman, an analyst with the brokerage firm of Janney, Montgomery
Scott Inc. in Philadelphia.
   Dorrance's heirs have attempted to squelch rumors that the
company may be up for sale, but analysts said the possibility
remains.
   ``I don't necessarily think a sale of the company is imminent,
but clearly the next alternative, if the new management can't get
this company up and running, might be the sale of the company,''
McMillin said.
   McGovern, who became president and CEO in 1980, has withdrawn
his name as a candidate for re-election at the meeting, the company
said. A replacement nominee will not be designated, the company
said.
   ``I leave with pride in our accomplishments and in the
management team now in place and with confidence in the company's
strategies for the future,'' the 63-year-old McGovern said in a
statement released by the company. ``The CEO succession process is
well along and I've decided for personal reasons to take early
retirement.''
   Campbell also announced the appointment Wednesday of Herbert M.
Baum, 53, and Edwin Harper, 47, as executive vice presidents. Baum
is president of Campbell U.S.A. and Harper is a senior vice
president and chief financial officer.
   Harper and Baum will assume the day-to-day operation of the
company on an interim basis, the company said. Both are also
candidates to succeed McGovern.
   Campbell spokesman James Moran said the board of directors
formed a management succession committee about a year ago in
anticipation of McGovern's retirement. He said a successor will not
be named at the shareholder's meeting.
   ``McGovern was getting up there in years,'' Moran said. ``They
had begun a search for a successor for him _ knowing he would
retire one day.''
   Under McGovern, Campbell's worldwide sales rose from $2.8
billion to $5.7 billion and net earnings climbed from $130 million
to $274 million, the company said. Campbell's sells about five
billion cans of soup a year, garnering about 65 percent of the $2.2
billion retail soup market.

   Upjohn Co. announced an early retirement
plan Wednesday it expected would trim as many as 350 workers from
the company's U.S. payroll of 12,000 to 13,000 employees.
   Upjohn spokesman Bob LaRue said there was no estimate of how
much money the program would save the pharmaceutical company
because that depends on how many workers take the retirement offer.
   He said about 1,100 employees are eligible, and that 50 percent
to 60 percent of them would take part in the program. About half
the anticipated vacancies created by the retirement program might
be filled with new workers, LaRue said.
   No part of the company's U.S. business was exempt from the
program.
   ``Over the past two years, we have followed a strategy in which
we exercised budget constraints and implemented an effective
headcount control program,'' Upjohn Chairman Theodore Cooper said
in a statement. ``By offering attractive terms to employees who are
on the retirement threshold, we can further our strategic
objectives by accelerating our corporate restructuring.''
   Employees aged 55 or older, whose combined age and experience
with the company add up to 75, are eligible. A formula based on
seniority and other matters could boost retirement pay 10 percent
to 20 percent per employee.
   Upjohn, which employs about 21,300 people worldwide,
manufactures human and animal health products, seeds and specialty
chemicals.

<HEAD>Chicago Merc Seeks Tougher Circuit Breakers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange on Wednesday
announced plans for tougher price limits on stock-index futures
that would further restrict certain types of program trading during
a stock-market collapse.
   The biggest proposed change in the so-called ``circuit
breakers'' is a 40 percent tighter restriction in how far the price
of Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock-index futures can fall before the
Merc halts selling for the rest of a day's session.
   The proposals, which require approval by the federal Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, also would add a fourth circuit breaker
to the three that have been in effect for more than a year.
   The Merc proposals come amid a barrage of criticism of certain
computerized, or program, trading strategies involving stock-index
futures that some experts blame for recent wild price swings in the
stock market.
   The Merc is the world's biggest market for the most popular
stock-index futures, those based on the Standard &amp; Poor's index of
500 stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
   An S&amp;P 500 future is a contract to buy or sell all 500 of those
stocks at a specified price by a specified date.
   In a program trading technique called index arbitrage, traders
use computers to rapidly buy and sell huge blocks of stocks in New
York and the underlying stock-index futures in Chicago in an
attempt to profit from minute differences in prices on the two
markets.
   Chicago Merc officials said their proposed modifications stemmed
from studies of the sharp market drops on Oct. 13 and 24, when some
of the circuit breakers were triggered.
   Under the proposals:
   _S&amp;P 500 futures would be allowed to fall no more than 5 points
_ the equivalent of 40 points in the Dow Jones industrial average _
during the first 10 minutes of trading. Currently, the 5-point-drop
restriction lapses if the S&amp;P contract rebounds from that lower
level within the 10-minute period.
   _The current limit of a 12-point drop in the S&amp;P contract,
roughly equal to 100 Dow points, would remain in effect, halting
selling below that level for 30 minutes.
   _Under a new rule, if the futures market falls 20 S&amp;P points,
which is roughly equivalent to 150 Dow points, trading below that
level would be halted for one hour. If the 20-point limit is
triggered after 1:30 p.m. Central time, the restriction would
remain in effect until the end of the session at 4:15 p.m.
   _The absolute daily point-drop limit would be tightened to 30
S&amp;P points, equal to about 250 Dow points, from 50 S&amp;P points,
roughly equal to 400 Dow points.

<TEXT>
   Ralston Purina Co., a pet food, baker and
battery maker, reported Wednesday a 46 percent drop in earnings for
its fiscal fourth quarter due mainly to a one-time charge to close
two plants and eliminate some jobs.
   Its profit for the fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, increased
8 percent compared with last year, while sales were up 13 percent.
   For the quarter, its profit totaled $45.2 million, or 65 cents a
share, down from $84.9 million, or $1.24 a share, for the same
period a year ago.
   Sales for the quarter were $1.76 billion, up slightly from $1.55
billion in the same quarter last year.
   The profit decline came in part because of a $31.4 million
pre-tax charge the company took to close a battery plant in
Greenville, S.C., and a bakery in Cincinnati, said Ralston
spokesman Patrick Farrell.
   He said the company also made staff cuts at its computer
operations center in St. Louis that figured into the charge.
   Even without the charges, however, its profit would have slipped
by nearly 10 percent, Farrell said.
   He said the company, the largest seller of dry dog food and
moist and dry cat food, had higher advertising and promotion costs,
sold less pet food and incurred higher costs for pet food
ingredients in the quarter.
   The company's Continental Baking subsidiary had slightly higher
profits in the quarter, but its Eveready battery business suffered
a decrease primarily because of the plant closing and economic
problems in South America.
   The company does not provide specific financial data about its
various subsidiaries.
   For the fiscal year, net earnings were $422.5 million, up from
last year's $387.8 million. Sales were $6.65 billion, compared with
$5.87 billion in 1988.

   Here are key provisions of the legislation to
increase the minimum wage to $4.25 an hour while creating a new
subminimum wage for certain teen-age workers. The bill becomes
effective next April 1.

<BYLINE>THE RATE</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The minimum wage, $3.35 an hour since January 1981, would
increase to $3.80 on April 1, 1990 and to $4.25 on April 1, 1991.
The Labor Department last year estimated that nearly 4 million
Americans worked at the minimum wage.

<BYLINE>THE SUBMINIMUM</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Workers 16-19 may be paid 85 percent of the prevailing minimum
wage for their first three months in the work force, and for an
additional three months if receiving formal training. No one over
20 or with six months total job experience may be paid the
subminimum, and the subminimum may never fall below the current
minimum, $3.35. The subminimum expires in April 1993.

   The Los Angeles Herald Examiner, once the
nation's largest afternoon newspaper, announced Wednesday it would
publish its last edition on Thursday.
   The announcement was made in a tearful 1 p.m. meeting called in
the newsroom by Robert Danzig, Hearst Corp. vice president and
general manager of Hearst Newspapers, who spoke from atop the copy
desk.
   The closure was attributed to heavy losses and a lack of
suitable buyers since the paper was formally placed for sale this
past summer. Herald officials and analysts said the underlying
causes were a bitter strike that began in 1967 combined with
competitive problems shared by all afternoon papers.
   Danzig said Hearst had tried everything it could to revive the
paper after the 10-year strike.
   ``We committed ourself to first-rate editorial leadership, fine
marketing professionals, and I think quite good promotion programs
and aggressive marketing,'' he said at an afternoon news conference.
   ``But the net result was that the pattern of those prior 10
years seemed to have been concretized, and we were unable to change
the economics.''
   The paper's 831 employees were told they would receive 60 days
severance pay and help looking for work, with longtime staffers
getting additional benefits.
   Employees greeted the news with emotional embraces as editor
Maxwell McCrohon urged them to ``put out a hell of a last edition.''
   The newspaper had considered going to a tabloid format for seven
years and probably a dozen prototypes were produced, but it
remained a full-sized newspaper to the end.
   Founded by William Randolph Hearst in 1903 as the Los Angeles
Examiner, the Herald was put up for sale by the Hearst Corp. The
company cited ``intense pressure'' from the Los Angeles Times, the
city's dominant daily with five times the Herald's daily
circulation.
   The Herald, which switched to morning publication in 1981, also
had to wrestle with increasingly successful suburban papers like
The Orange County Register, based in Santa Ana, and the Los Angeles
Daily News, based in the San Fernando Valley.
   In its dying days, the newspaper covered local politics
aggressively, breaking a number of stories on embattled Mayor Tom
Bradley that embarrassed the Times. While it provided little
staff-produced coverage of Washington or international affairs, its
entertainment coverage, sports columnists and local reporting were
highly regarded.
   The Herald, which reached its highest circulation of 729,000 in
1967, had an average circulation of 238,392 daily and 183,122
Sunday for the six months ended March 31, compared with the Times'
1,119,840 daily and 1,423,310 Sunday, according to figures compiled
to Audit Bureau of Circulations.
   Its building, built in 1912, is a Spanish-style Los Angeles
landmark with colorful domes and tile roof outside, and baroque
touches inside. It was designed by Julia Morgan, the architect
responsible for the Hearst Castle near San Luis Obispo.
   Those who had expressed interest in buying the paper included
billionaires Kirk Kerkorian, Marvin Davis and Rupert Murdoch and
the company that owns the Toronto Sun. An employee buyout plan also
fizzled.
   An investor who had examined the Herald's books, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said the paper was losing $1.5 million per
month.
   ``Despite inquiries from around the world and extensive
discussion with numerous parties, we were unable to find a
purchaser that could provide the financial capacity to sustain the
business,'' said Danzig, the Hearst vice president.
   ``Although operating at a financial deficit for more than two
decades, there was never a deficit in the quality and the vigor of
its editorial commitment to the people of Los Angeles. It has been
a losing business, but a winning newspaper.''
   By the time the Herald converted to morning publication, ``the
game was over,'' said John Morton, a newspaper analyst at the
Lynch, Jones &amp; Ryan brokerage firm.
   ``The Herald Examiner is a classic example of a newspaper that
suffered for many years by being in the afternoon position,'' he
said.
   Like other Hearst newspapers, the Herald was ``oriented toward
the blue-collar market, and that market left for television in
droves back in the 1950s and 1960s,'' Morton said.
   McCrohon, the editor, also attributed the paper's fall to a
long, bitter strike. On Dec. 15, 1967, members of the Los Angeles
Newspaper Guild launched the sometimes violent 10-year strike,
which was never technically settled.

<HEAD>Boeing Sees 767-X Talks As Latest In Long-Term Relationship With
Japanese</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boeing Co.'s discussions with three Japanese
aerospace companies about helping develop Boeing's new 767-X
jetliner are a logical outgrowth of the company's decade-long
relationship with the firms, a Boeing spokesman said Wednesday.
   While Boeing may want help in bearing the risk of developing a
multibillion-dollar new plane, the Japanese companies see a
partnership as a way to learn the commercial aircraft business.
   Some experts on international trade are worried what might
happen if the Japanese learn too well.
   In Tokyo, a spokesman for Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd. said
Wednesday that Chairman Kenko Hasegawa and the chairmen of
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. and Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd.
received official invitations from Boeing to join in the design,
production and sale of the 767-X.
   ``It will allow us to learn both the hard and soft aspects (of
the airplane industry) from a top-level firm,'' said a Mitsubishi
official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The three companies have long worked with Boeing as
subcontractors and were partners with the Seattle aerospace company
on a smaller jet that was never built.
   The wide-body 767-X would be Boeing's entry in the 300-passenger
jetliner class now dominated by the European consortium Airbus
Industrie and McDonnell Douglas Corp.
   No decision has been made to build the plane. Boeing spokesman
Dick Schleh said the 767-X has been under consideration for more
than a year and discussions with Fuji, Kawasaki and Mitsubishi have
been proceeding for three months or more.
   The three have worked with Boeing since the mid-1970s, and,
along with Italy's Aeritalia, have been ``risk-sharing partners,''
on the 767, which began development 11 years ago. Such partners,
Boeing says, share in financial risks and rewards of an aircraft
program, rather than just being paid for components.
   The Japanese companies make fuselage panels for the twin-engine,
wide-body 767. They and other Japanese firms also are
subcontractors for Boeing 737s, 747s and 757s, making such parts as
gearboxes, altimeters, wing ribs and lavatories.
   The extended-range 767-300ER can carry 210 passengers in three
classes 7,200 miles, and holds up to 290 passengers in an
all-tourist-class configuration. Boeing's next-largest plane is the
747, which can haul 412 passengers more than 8,000 miles.
   What Boeing lacks is a plane to compete with Airbus' A300, A330
and A340 models, which can hold 250 to 335 passengers, and
McDonnell Douglas' MD-11, which holds about 320.
   Other than to say the 767-X is envisioned as falling between the
767 and 747, Schleh and Boeing spokesman Craig Martin wouldn't
discuss what the plane might look like. Among possibilities
mentioned by industry observers is a double-decker wide-body.
   Fuji, Kawasaki and Mitsubishi were to have a 25 percent share in
the development of Boeing's 7J7, a 150-passenger plane that was to
be powered by new-technology ``unducted fan'' engines. That
project, announced in 1985, was put on hold when no buyers
materialized.
   When the question of Japanese involvement came up then, Boeing
Commercial Airplanes President Dean Thornton said the Japanese
``were going to become involved in a commercial jet program one way
or another. We sure as hell didn't want them to get involved with
Airbus Industrie.''
   Japanese involvement with the 767-X could range from a supplier
relationship to a partnership, Martin said.
   The Japan Economic Journal this week estimated the 767-X's total
development cost at $4 billion and said the three Japanese firms
are expected to bear about 20 percent of that.
   Since World War II, Japan has produced just one type of civilian
airliner, a 60-passenger turboprop. It also makes military planes,
mostly under license from U.S. manufacturers.
   It has agreed with the United States on joint development of
Japan's next generation jet fighter, the FSX. That program was
approved after a hard fight in Congress, where critics said the $6
billion project amounted to a giveaway of U.S. technology that
Japan could use to become competitive in the civilian aircraft
market.
   Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., a senior associate at the Carnegie
Endowment and a former Commerce Department trade negotiator, was
wary of a Boeing-Japan deal, though he stressed he did not know
specifics.
   He said aerospace has been identified as one of the most
important industries for Japan in the 21st century. ``There is the
potential for substantial technology transfer to Japanese companies
without getting much back,'' he said.

   Eleventh-hour negotiations averted a shutdown of
Chicago, Missouri and Western Railway Co. and put the bankrupt
company's sale back on track, CM&amp;W's trustee said Wednesday.
   Under an agreement given tentative approval Tuesday by U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge John Schwartz, Rio Grande Industries Inc. _ parent
of Southern Pacific Railroad _ will purchase CM&amp;W's north-south
line for $21.5 million, said Daniel Murray, court-appointed trustee
for the failed railroad company.
   Schwartz was expected to give the deal final approval next
Tuesday, Murray said.
   Without the agreement, CM&amp;W's cash collateral would have been
forfeited to creditors and the railroad would have been shut down
at midnight Wednesday, the trustee said.
   Rio Grande also will pay $1 million in start-up expenses and
assume responsibility for $11 million in loans the state of
Illinois made last year to keep struggling CM&amp;W afloat.
   The state, meanwhile, has agreed to reduce interest rates on the
existing loans and extend their payoff periods, as well as to
forgive another $2.5 million loan by changing it to a grant,
officials said.
   Illinois Attorney General Neil Hartigan said the state also
would lend Southern Pacific $36 million to install continuous
welded rails along the entire north-south route.
   The route runs 632 miles from Joliet to the Kansas City area. It
is mainly used for freight, but Amtrak also uses it to make daily
round-trip passenger runs between Chicago and St. Louis.
   A shutdown of the line would have left more than 100 businesses
in Illinois and Missouri without rail service. An estimated 300,000
people travel the route annually.
   Hartigan, representatives of Illinois Gov. James Thompson, and
other state officials entered into negotiations last weekend with
CM&amp;W and its creditors, who sought liquidation of the railroad's
assets to pay back debts totaling more than $100 million.
   Citicorp North America Inc. and Heller Financial Inc. had asked
the court to cancel the CM&amp;W contract with Amtrak because they said
the railroad is continuing to lose money on the passenger service
and ``has no reasonable prospects of successful reorganization.''
   Pat Yoxall, a spokeswoman for Citicorp, said the creditors had
met with state and CM&amp;W officials, but declined to specify what
agreements had been reached.
   ``All of those groups are part of the discussion,'' Yoxall said
Wednesday in a telephone interview. ``We gave the judge
confirmation that negotiations are ongoing.''
   Negotiations continued with Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co., which seeks
to purchase the CM&amp;W's east-west lines, which run between St. Louis
and Kansas City and are used for freight.
   Murray said the Wertheim cash proposal will go before Schwartz
on Dec. 4.
   Schwartz is considering a proposal, submitted Tuesday, to have
Santa Fe Railway operate the lines until then, the trustee said.
   CM&amp;W was created in 1986 as an independent regional railroad.
   In April 1988, the railroad filed for protection from creditors
and reorganization under federal bankruptcy law.

   Amoco Corp. should pay about $100 million for
damages incurred when its Amoco Cadiz tanker ran aground, spilling
68 million gallons of crude oil off the coast of France in 1978, a
judge has decided.
   The final judgment, which includes interest, was recommended
Tuesday by former U.S. District Court Judge Frank McGarr, who was
appointed special master in the case after retiring from the bench
in January 1988.
   McGarr filed his recommendations with U.S. District Court Judge
Charles Norgle, who gave attorneys on both sides until Nov. 14 to
file objections. The recommendations must receive final approval by
a federal judge.
   ``We have maintained all along that the claim of damages from
this unfortunate incident were exaggerated,'' Amoco spokesman Mike
Thompson said Wednesday. ``And we intend to appeal.''
   Attorneys for the plaintiffs did not return telephone calls
Wednesday seeking comment.
   McGarr found Amoco, formerly Standard Oil of Indiana, and a
Spanish shipbuilding firm liable for damages. The second phase of
the trial, which is still not resolved, was to determine the cost
of damages.
   The French government and other plaintiffs had sought more than
$1 billion in damages. The oil spill off the Brittany coast
devastated sealife, including valuable oyster beds in the area, and
impinged on the tourism trade.

   Contract talks to end a strike by Boeing Co.
production workers are focused on money, overtime and pensions,
``the big three issues,'' a union spokesman said Wednesday as the
company and union met for a third day.
   The negotiations concluded Wednesday evening with plans to
resume Thursday, the 30th day of the walkout, in the office of
federal mediator Doug Hammond.
   Meanwhile, the state's chief economist, Chang Mook Sohn, said
Wednesday he doubted the strike would have much effect on the
state's robust economy unless it runs at least three more months.
   ``The other factors in the economy are very strong and so far
are offsetting any impact the strike has had,'' he said.
   Hammond has said he hoped to keep the two sides meeting until a
settlement is reached.
   ``The longer they go, the better it is,'' said Jack Daniels of
District Lodge 751, International Association of Machinists and
Aerospace Workers. ``My understanding is that they're talking about
the big three issues.''
   Union leaders have said the top issues are pay, mandatory
overtime and pensions.
   The Machinists represent 57,800 Boeing workers, including 43,300
in the local district lodge; 12,000 in Wichita, Kan.; 1,700 in
Portland, Ore.; and a few hundred at scattered sites in California,
Hawaii, Utah, Montana, Wyoming and other states.
   In an 85 percent strike vote Oct. 3, the day before the walkout
began, union members rejected a three-year offer with annual pay
raises of 4 percent, 3 percent and 3 percent, and bonuses of 8
percent of gross pay in the first year and 3 percent in the second.
   Also included were cost-of-living increases to virtually cover
inflation, a reduction in mandatory overtime from 200 to 160 hours
per quarter and higher benefits.
   Boeing officials have said the total dollars in the rejected
offer would not be increased. Union leaders have said there can be
no settlement without more money.
   Meanwhile, full-scale bargaining was set to begin Thursday, a
day later than originally planned, on a contract for Boeing's
second-largest union, the Seattle Professional Engineering
Employees Association, which represents about 28,000 engineers and
technical workers.
   The union's contract expires Dec. 1, and both sides say a strike
is unlikely.

   Robert L. Bernstein, chairman, president and
chief executive officer of Random House Inc., will retire from the
publishing company at the end of the year, it was announced
Wednesday.
   S.I. Newhouse Jr., chairman of Advance Publications Inc., which
owns Random House, indicated that a successor would be announced
soon, according to William T. Loverd, a spokesman for the
publishing house.
   Loverd said Bernstein would work closely with whomever is named.
   Bernstein, 66, joined Random House in 1957 and is just the
second president in the company's 64-year history, Loverd said. He
succeeded Random House's founder, Bennett Cerf, as president in
1966.
   During Bernstein's 23 years as head of the company, annual sales
increased from $40 million to $800 million this year, Loverd said.
   According to Loverd, ``after long and careful thought, Mr.
Bernstein indicated that he had decided to retire and had submitted
his resignation.''
   Newhouse accepted the resignation with regret, Loverd said.
   Bernstein was very involved in building Random House's juvenile
book department, Loverd said. Dr. Seuss was among the authors with
whom he had important relationships; others included John Hersey,
Robert A. Caro, James A. Michener, Robert Ludlum and E.L. Doctorow.
   Bernstein plans to continue his work in the international human
rights movement, Loverd said. He is the founder and chairman of the
Watch Committees (which include the Helsinki Watch, the Americas
Watch and the Asia Watch, among others) and of the Fund for Free
Expression.
   He brought to Random House the writings of some of the world's
prominent dissident figures, including Andrei Sakharov, Yelena
Bonner and Natan Scharansky, Loverd said.
   Random House is the largest general trade publisher in the
United States and one of the world's principal book publishers.
   Advance Publications also owns 26 daily newspapers, Newhouse
Broadcasting, The New Yorker, Details, Parade and Conde Nast
Publications. Conde Nast includes magazines such as Vogue, Glamour,
Vanity Fair and GQ.

   Robert L. Bernstein, chairman, president and
chief executive officer of Random House Inc., will step down at the
end of the year, the publishing giant announced Wednesday.
   S.I. Newhouse Jr., chairman of Advance Publications Inc., which
owns Random House, indicated that a successor would be announced
soon, according to William T. Loverd, a spokesman for Random House.
   Random House is the largest general-interest book publisher in
the United States and one of the world's principal publishers.
   Bernstein, 66, joined Random House in 1957 and is just the

   According to Loverd, ``after long and careful thought Mr.
Bernstein indicated that he had decided to retire and had submitted
his resignation.''
   Newhouse accepted the resignation with regret, Loverd said.
   Bernstein, who three years ago declared, ``I want to be a
publisher until I'm carried out,'' said his decision to step down
``evolved out of talks with Si,'' as Newhouse is known, The New
York Times reported.
   ``There was no serious disagreement between Si and myself. It's
not as though there was some incident. It just seemed the right
thing to do,'' Bernstein said.
   Loverd said Bernstein would work closely with whomever is named

   Bernstein was very involved in building Random House's juvenile

   Eastern Airlines added 75 flights Wednesday,
pushing the carrier's schedule to 775 daily departures.
   Meanwhile, a spokesman for Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp.
called a vote by the U.S. House to bar airline buyouts by people
who have taken more than one airline into bankruptcy ``blatantly
unconstitutional.''
   The amendment offered by Rep. Doug Bosco, D-Calif., and approved
283-132 Tuesday was designed to apply soley to Texas Air Chairman
Frank Lorenzo, who took Continental Airlines into bankruptcy in
1983 and returned to bankruptcy court with Eastern earlier this
year.
   ``I would think the U.S. Congress has better things to do than
to take up its time with an obviously union-inspired amendment,''
said spokesman Art Kent.
   Eastern resumed service to five Caribbean destinations and added
nonstop flights from Miami to Los Angeles, San Francisco, Toronto,
Chicago and Newark, N.J., among other cities. Eastern added 29
daily departures from its Miami home, giving it 65 flights.
   ``Obviously, it puts us that much closer to our goal of 800
announced earlier,'' company spokesman Robin Matell said. ``We're
not only on target, but we're ahead of schedule.''
   Eastern announced in April, more than a month after being hit
with a crippling strike by its three unions, that it would rebuild
with a goal of 800 flights by year end. Company executives recently
said they're shooting for 1,000 daily flights by early next year,
compared with nearly 1,100 before the strike that started March 4.
   Matell said Eastern plans to have 835 daily flights by Dec. 2.
It returned Wednesday to Montego Bay, Jamaica; St. Martin; Grand
Cayman; Antigua and Nassau, Bahamas.
   The latest schedule boost came as Eastern's creditors were
studying the company's revised reorganization plan for coming out
of Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The creditors' committee will
meet in New York next Tuesday to vote on Eastern's plan.
   Union officials have said Eastern's schedule increases rely on
planes and pilots from Texas Air Corp. sister Continental Airlines
and won't generate enough revenue to make Eastern viable. The
unions say 10 percent to 15 percent of Eastern flights are flown by
leased Continental planes and crews, meaning Houston-based
Continental is draining cash from Eastern.
   Matell said only 16 Continental planes and crews were being
used, accounting for about 5 percent of Eastern's schedule.
   Meanwhile, a poll published Wednesday indicated more Floridians
think the striking Eastern unions are in the right than support
management's position.
   However, the largest group of respondents in the Florida
International University-Florida poll said they were unfamiliar
with the strike.
   The poll, conducted for The Miami Herald, indicated that 31
percent of Floridians think the unions are in the right and 21
percent think management is right. Some 33 percent said they were
unfamiliar with the issues, while 15 percent said they weren't sure
who was right or had no response.
   In South Florida, 33 percent said the unions were right and 27
percent thought management was right.
   The poll was based on telephone interviews with 1,232 randomly
selected Florida adults from Aug. 28 through Sept. 21. The margin
of error for the statewide sample was plus or minus three points.
   Hank Weber, a spokesman for the striking pilots, said the poll
``reinforces what we've known all along. Of people familiar with
the situation, 50 percent more think we are correct than think we
are incorrect.''
   The pilots union won a legal victory Tuesday when a federal
arbitrator ruled that Eastern must pay pilots an estimated $60
million to $100 million in back pay.
   The grievance, filed three years ago, stemmed from a 1986
agreement before Texas Air bought Eastern. The pilots agreed to 20
percent pay cuts, but said they were promised any increases for
other workers' groups would be matched.
   Eastern's new owners claimed the agreement was invalid and
rejected the pilots' request for an 8 percent increase to match one
given subsequently to members of the Machinists union.
   Matell said the airline might appeal.
   ``Needless to say, we are very disappointed by the ruling, since
it would involve a potential financial obligation by the company if
the decision is sustained _ an obligation that is totally
unwarranted,'' Matell said.
   Arbitrator J. Ralph Beaird of Athens, Ga., ruled Tuesday in the
pilots' favor. Under his ruling, the pilots would also receive 8
percent more in all future paychecks. Pilots' attorney James Linsey
said the pilots in a separate case are seeking 20 percent increases
to match hikes given Eastern management and maintenance supervisors.
   The back-pay award could be stayed by a federal bankruptcy judge
while Eastern reorganizes.
