<HEAD>State Ordered to Fund Services for Retarded Who Live at Home</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A judge Monday ordered the state to provide
$7.56 million to finance services for mentally retarded
Philadelphians living at home, saying state law requires adequate
services ``for all persons who need them.''
   Commonwealth Court President Judge James Crumlish Jr. also
ordered the city to immediately restore the program, which a budget
cutback forced officials to gut July 1.
   Crumlish noted that failure to provide the services would risk
institutionalization for the 7,750 retarded people enrolled before
the budget cutback.
   Crumlish ordered the state Public Welfare Department to ask the
Legislature for the funds within 10 days and also to ``reimburse the
city for monies expended to reinstate and operate these programs.''
   ``The crying needs of and imminent harm to the individuals at
issue here, unable to speak themselves, cannot be ignored while the
intricacies of the General Assembly budgetary process unfold,'' the
judge said.
   By ordering the state to seek additional funds from the
Legislature, the judge pointed out, the department will be able to
retain services in other counties.
   The lawsuit was the second the state has lost over the
Philadelphia program. During the last fiscal year, unhappy with
deficits in the program, the Legislature tried to withhold the
appropriation, acquiescing only under court order.
   ``We've won on the law,'' said attorney David Ferleger, who
represents retarded people waiting for services. ``The judge said
everybody who is entitled to services should get them. It is a great
victory, not only in Pennsylvania, but for retarded persons
everywhere in this country.''
   Vicki Smink, spokeswoman for the welfare department, said no
decision on an appeal has been made.
   The program involves teaching and training the retarded in basic
life and social skills, such as feeding and dressing themselves and
learning a simple job.
   The current injunction, sought by the city and joined by the
Philadelphia Police and Fire Association for Handicapped Children,
affects only the mentally retarded receiving services before the new
fiscal year started July 1.
   The judge noted that the state Mental Health and Mental
Retardation Act of 1966 provides that the commonwealth pay 90
percent and each county the remaining 10 percent of the costs.
   ``Philadelphia's programs have operated at a deficit since
1982,'' Crumlish said in the nine-page opinion granting the
preliminary injunction. ``In each year, the city has found a way to
avoid service cuts.''

   The United States intends to give Hungary
permanent most-favored nation trade status, President Bush said
Monday.
   In Budapest, Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said the United
States was negoatiating toward a comprehensive pact to ````support
Hungary's efforts to develop a freer political system and to create
and expand private enterprise,'' said Mosbacher, who is in Budapest
for talks with Hungarian officials.
   The president's decision was annouced as Hungary's new parliament
speaker, Matyas Szuros, told The Washington Post he sees the
possibility that his nation could withdraw from the Warsaw Pact and
become neutral by the end of the century.
   Szuros, whose comments were published in the Post's Tuesday
editions, said the shift to neutrality could take place ``within a
climate of trust'' between Hungary and the Soviet Union.
   The financial package announced Monday includes improved tariff
treatment of Hungarian products, new development programs and
creation of a $25 million fund to help create private business there.
   ``This step is an important part of implementing President Bush's
goal of building an American partnership with Hungary,'' Mosbacher
said in a statement after a meeting with Hungarian Trade Minister
Tamas Beck. A copy of the statement was made available in Washington.
   ``Such an agreement is fundamental for private sector business
because it would contain investment protection guarantees which
boost confidence and open the way to subtantially increased U.S.
private investment in Hungary.''
   In Helena, Mont., President Bush told a news conference: `Hungary
has taken major steps toward economic and political reform and
during our recent visit we witnessed significant changes toward
freedom in that country. ... Our commitment to helping the reform
movement in Eastern Europe is strong. Our step today underscores our
willingness to help these countries.''
   The White House released Bush's letter to Congress in which he
said ``it is my intent to add Hungary to the list'' of countries
that qualify for most-favored nation status, which would guarantee
Hungary the lowest tariffs for its products that any competing
country gets.
   Mosbacher led the high-level mission to Hungary to explore new
trade and investment opportunities. The mission will prepare
recommendations on private sector expansion of U.S. trade.
   The Commerce secretary said Hungary would be granted permanent
most favored trade status in October if its parliament, as expected,
enacts legislation on freedom of emigration by the end of September.
   Hungary would become the first Eastern bloc country to receive
most favored status under the Jackson-Vanik Amendment of 1974, which
tied such benefits to a country's emigration policies. Yugoslavia
and Poland have continuous most favored nation status, but both
preceeded 1974.
   The status assures that exports to the United States won't face
discriminatory tariffs. Hungary receives such benefits only on a
year-to-year basis.
   Mosbacher also said Bush is notifying Congress of his intention
to designate Hungary eligible for Generalized System of Preferences
treatment, which would offer Hungarian exporters duty-free tariff
treatment for a broad range of exports to the United States worth
more than $110 million.
   ``To help Hungary take full advantage of this program, we will be
sending a team of Washington-based GSP experts to Hungary to conduct
seminars and provide in-depth technical assistance,'' Mosbacher said.
   He also said an agreement had been reached granting Hungary a 30
percent increase in steel exports to the United States.
   Bush has submitted legislation to extend Overseas Private
Investment Corp. programs to Hungary and create a $25 million fund
to help establish private business there.
   Those programs would provide investment guarantees to U.S.
companies investing in Hungary.

<HEAD>Richard Leakey Says People Should Stop Wearing Ivory</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The only way to stop poachers from
killing elephants for their tusks is to take the fashion statement
out of ivory, Kenya's leading wildlife official said.
   ``A piece of paper which says you shall not trade in elephant
ivory is about worth the paper it's written on,'' Richard Leakey
said Sunday at a benefit for Friends of Conservation.
   ``The way to stop the trade in elephants is to make the people of
the world disgusted and revolted by the wearing of animal parts,
particularly elephants.''
   Leakey, who became director of wildlife conservation in Kenya in
the spring, has boosted the East African country's efforts to save
its elephant population.
   Earlier this year, Kenya was losing an average of 2{ elephants
every day from its national parks and reserves, Leakey said. The
country's elephant population has dwindled during the last decade
from 65,000 to 17,000.
   Leakey said that during the past four months poaching has
virtually stopped because of a crackdown on poaching.
   Four people have been killed since July in attacks that Leakey
blamed on poachers who were frustrated by the drive, he said.
   Friends of Conservation was originally founded as Friends of the
Masai Mara in 1982 to preserve the wildlife and endangered habitat
of the Masai Mara Game Reserve in Kenya.
   By 1987, the original project was expanded to help other regions
in Africa, and the name was changed to Friends of Conservation. The
group has offices in Oak Brook, Ill., London and Nairobi.

   Paul Newman, the blue-eyed actor, race car
driver, hustler and salad-dressing maker, is full of regrets at age
64 despite his accomplishments.
   ``I look like I'm having a lot of fun, and I am,'' Newman said in
October's Esquire Magazine.
   ``But I should be having more fun than I'm having. In work, I'm
not happy because it will never be good enough. I'll never be a
proper father or a great lover or an extraordinary boxer or a
capable skier or an astronaut. Those are all the things I'm
missing.''
   ``If they say you are accomplished, or a great lover but you
don't feel it, what good is it?
   ``They make that up about you, but it has nothing to do with you,
and so it strengthens the opinion that you have of yourself _ that
you are simply nothing but an accumulation of characteristics that
you've picked up from playing other people,'' Newman said.
   When his 44th and 45th films are released this year, Newman will
add two more characters to his repertoire.
   In ``Blaze,'' he plays former Gov. Earl Long of Louisiana. In
``Fat Man and Little Boy,'' he plays Leslie Groves, the general in
charge of building the atom bomb.
   ``I'm a kid from Shaker Heights who benefited from the luck of
the draw,'' Newman said of the Cleveland suburb.
   Newman's suggested epitaph _ ``Here lies Paul Newman, who died a
flop because his eyes turned brown.''

   Rock star and avid hunter Ted Nugent had an
anti-drug message as he enthused about the thrill of bagging deer
with bow and arrow.
   ``If you want to get high, come out with me and whack one of
them,'' he told the 40 people attending a police-sponsored hunting
safety seminar Saturday. ``If only Elvis Presley was a hunter he
would be alive today.''
   Officer Tom Ellis invited Nugent to talk at the seminar after
meeting the ``Motor City Madman'' at an archery range this spring.
Seminar participants weren't told of Nugent's appearance beforehand.
   ``The bottom line is if you really want to live and whack some
stuff and compete with deer, you've got to be cocked, locked and
ready to rock,'' said Nugent. ``That means clean living.''

   Singer Toni Tennille prefers the grandeur
of the back country to the glitter of show business now that she and
husband Daryl Dragon have retired their The Captain and Tennille act.
   Tennille has climbed Mount Whitney twice since moving to this
Lake Tahoe resort community in 1984, and formed a hiking group
called Women in the Sierra, which makes annual weeklong treks into
the mountains.
   ``It's like being a Girl Scout again,'' Tennille, 49, said last
week. ``You leave your husband, the kids, the telephones, the fax
machines, everything behind and just see the land the way it was
before we screwed it up.
   ``Living this kind of life, your spirit stays young. I want to be
hiking and climbing `til I'm an ancient old lady. ... Now if I could
just get Daryl to go ... He's a Malibu boy.''
   The Captain and Tennille was retired this year, but Tennille is
booked to perform with several symphony orchestras around the
country and for several benefit concerts.
   ``If I can't sing because of joy, then I don't want to sing,''
she said. ``And I'm in a position now where I can do that.''

   When ``Saturday Night Live'' made its debut on
NBC on Oct. 11, 1975, no one knew it would grow to become a comedy
institution, according to producer Lorne Michaels.
   ``It was a little, dinky late-night show,'' Michaels said in this
week's People magazine. ``It wasn't going to change anything. It
wasn't seminal.''
   But the show took off, making stars of such unknowns as John
Belushi, Gilda Radner, Chevy Chase, Bill Murray, Eddie Murphy, Joe
Piscopo, Billy Crystal and Martin Short.
   ``There was really no way to know what the impact of the show
was,'' said another original SNLer, Laraine Newman, ``except that
the next day people would pass us on the street and yell out
something that we'd done the night before.''
   The show, which won an Emmy on Sunday for variety show writing,
will celebrate the start of its 15th season with a live special on
Sept. 24.

   Pop music satirist Weird Al Yankovic and boxer
Sugar Ray Leonard answered two ailing boys' wishes, meeting them for
a tennis match at the Westside Tennis Club.
   ``It was very touching,'' said Karen Whitworth, executive
director of the Texas Gulf Coast chapter of the international Make A
Wish Foundation.
   Weird Al played tennis Sunday with an 11-year-old named Aaron,
and Sugar Ray played with a 6-year-old named Hunter. Both boys
suffer from life-threatening illnesses, said Ms. Whitworth, who did
not disclose what the illnesses are or the boys' last names.
   The matches were played during a tennis tournament for
celebrities and physicians sponsored by the Chicago-based
pharmaceutical company, Searle.
   Searle presented the Make A Wish chapter with a check for $40,000
and the tournament raised $5,000 more for the organization, which
meets the wishes of terminally ill children.
   The tournament coincides with this week's Interscience Conference
on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy.

<HEAD>ETA Claims Assasination After Two ETA Men Killed And 19 Arrested</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Paramilitary civil guards killed two members
of the Basque separatist group ETA in a shootout near the French
border and arrested 19 others in an ensuing sweep, the Interior
Ministry announced.
   After the Saturday night shootout, the Ministry said, 19 other
alleged ETA members were arrested in the three-province northeastern
Basque country in a wide police operation. It said police also
seized caches of weapons, grenades and more than 650 pounds of
explosives.
   On Sunday, just hours after the sweep, ETA claimed responsibility
for the Sept. 12 assassination in Madrid of a top female prosecutor.
   In an announcement Sunday, the Interior Minister identified the
two men killed in the previous night's shootout on a highway near
the Basque town of Irun as Juan Oyarbide Aramburu and Manuel
Urionabarrenechea Betanzos.
   It said they were members of the ETA commando unit Araba and were
trying to cross into France in a Madrid-registered truck when civil
guards ordered them to stop and identify themselves.
   Occupants of the truck began shooting and throwing hand grenades
and two were killed by return fire, while three civil guards were
wounded, the ministry said. A third member of the Araba commando
unit, Juan Carlos Arruti Azpitarte, was arrested, along with two
other occupants of the truck, the ministry said.
   Police blame the Araba commando unit for at least six
assasinations and the national head of the civil guard, Luis Roldan,
said the unit may have been responsible for the Sept. 12
assassination of prosecutor Carmen Tagle.
   In a note sent to the San Sebastian newspaper Egin on Sunday, ETA
said its guerrillas shot to death Tagle, 44, who had a reputation as
a tough, anti-terrorist prosecutor and had successsfully prosecuted
many ETA terrorists. Tagle was killed by two men in a car who fired
automatic weapons as she drove into her home garage.
   Since beginning its 21-year campaign of violence for independence
from Spain for the three Basque provinces, ETA has claimed attacks
that have killed more than 600 people, mainly police, military and
civil guard officers.
   So far this year, ETA-claimed attacks have claimed 12 lives.
   More than 550 ETA members are currently jailed in Spanish prisons.

   ``L.A. Law'' and ``Cheers'' scored the
top series awards at the 41st Emmy awards Sunday night, which
honored series stars who portrayed a Vietnam nurse, a widower, a TV
reporter and a Southern cop.
   The 41st Annual Primetime Emmy Awards divided its honors evenly,
and miraculously ended seven minutes ahead of its three-hour
scheduled closing, the first time that has happened in a decade.
   ``War and Remembrance,'' which critics said took longer to show
than the Second World War it chronicled, won outstanding miniseries
and led a charge that stampeded favorite ``Lonesome Dove'' out of
town.
   The leading winners were ``Murphy Brown,'' CBS' TV newsroom
comedy; ``thirtysomething,'' the ABC yuppie drama series and the Fox
Network comedy-variety presentation ``The Tracey Ullman Show.'' Each
claimed four Emmys.
   Actress Colleen Dewhurst won two awards, both for guest
appearances.
   ``L.A. Law,'' which previously won as best dramatic series in
1987, repeated Sunday night as did ``Cheers,'' which was named best
comedy series previously in 1983 and 1984.
   CBS, third in the Nielsen ratings last season, collected the
honor for total awards with 27, followed by NBC with 25 and ABC with
13. The newcomer Fox Network claimed its first Emmys for a total of
four.
   The predicted sweep for the epic western miniseries ``Lonesome
Dove'' did not materialize. It won only a single Emmy on the
broadcast for director Simon Winser, adding to its six awards during
the technical academy presentation Saturday night. It had 18
nominations.
   ``A major shock,'' exclaimed ``War and Remembrance'' producer Dan
Curtis, whose 12-part miniseries aired over 17 hours and 25 minutes
in November 1988 and 11{ hours in May 1989. Its budget was estimated
at a record $100 million.
   The miniseries continued the saga writer Herman Wouk began in the
novel and miniseries ``The Winds of War,'' beginning one week after
Pearl Harbor. It concerned the wartime lives of the family of naval
Capt. Victor ``Pug'' Henry.
   ``It took longer than World War II, I know,'' Curtis said in his
acceptance. ``I want to thank ABC for having the guts to pony up the
dough for this.''
   James Woods, the founder of Alcoholics Anonymous in ``My Name Is
Bill W.'' and Holly Hunter, who won a pro-choice verdict from the
U.S. Supreme Court in ``Roe Vs. Wade'' were named outstanding stars
of a miniseries or special.
   Woods, who won an Emmy two years ago for ``Promise,'' told the
Pasadena Civic Auditorium and Fox Broadcasting audience that he
considered it ``truly an honor to play the man I consider a saint.''
   In her remarks, Miss Hunter, who was nominated for an Oscar as
the frantic producer in ``Broadcast News,'' thanked the real Jane
Roe, Norma McCorvey, ``for continuing to keep women from being
second-class citizens, and for refusing to give up her right for a
reproductive choice.''
   ``Roe vs. Wade'' also was a co-winner as outstanding drama-comedy
special, sharing the Emmy with ``Day One,'' an account of the
development of the first atomic bomb.
   The award for ``Day One'' was the first one for its co-executive
producer Aaron Spelling, producer of ``Dynasty,'' ``Charlie's
Angeles,'' ``Love Boat'' and other such shows.
   Dana Delany won her Emmy for best actress in a dramatic series
playing the compassionate nurse in the Vietnam war series ``China
Beach,'' and Carroll O'Connor won his for the crusty officer of ``In
The Heat of the Night.''
   Miss Delany appeared stunned by her win over Susan Dey and Jill
Eikenberry of ``L.A. Law,'' Angela Lansbury of ``Murder, She Wrote''
and Linda Hamilton of ``Beauty and the Beast.''
   ``I'd like to thank the women who served in Vietnam. I will never
know what it was like to have been there. I would like to thank you
for sharing your experiences and allowing me to pay you the tribute
you so greatly deserve,'' she said.
   O'Connor was near Covington, Ga., where the third season of ``In
the Heat of the Night'' is being shot. He is executive producer this
year as well as star this year.
   O'Connor was reading a book on Civil War generals Grant and Lee,
and was dozing off when he got word of his Emmy via a telephone call.
   ``That's a surprise. I'm pleased to have won four Emmy awards in
the comedy field (``All In The Family'') , and now to win one in the
dramatic field is a great delight. I am surprised.''
   Candice Bergen, as the hard-driving reporter in ``Murphy Brown''
was a popular winner. She closed her acceptance with a comment,
``Dad, if you're watching, this is for you.'' Her late father,
ventriloquist Edgar Bergen, was the founding president of the
Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.
   Veteran comic actor Richard Mulligan of ``Empty Nest,'' who had
previously won for his zany role in ``Soap'' in 1980, also won
hearty applause from the audience.
   He thanked fellow actors, including Bear the dog and his trainer,
and dedicated his Emmy to the late Cathryn Damon, who won an award
as his wife in ``Soap,'' and later died of cancer.
   An ecstatic Tracey Ullman came on stage with her eight
co-producers to claim the award for outstanding variety, music or
comedy program for ``The Tracey Ullman Show.''
   Miss Dewhurst won her second Emmy in two nights for a supporting
performance and British actor Derek Jacobi was selected outstanding
supporting actor in a miniseries or special.
   Miss Dewhurst, a distinguished Broadway performer, was named
Saturday night for outstanding guest actress in a comedy series as
Miss Bergen's mother in ``Murphy Brown.'' She added another Emmy on
Sunday as supporting actress in a miniseries or special for her role
as Margaret Page in the NBC special ``Those She Left Behind.''
   Jacobi was chosen for playing the impostor G.I. in Hallmark Hall
of Fame's ``The Tenth Man.''
   The television academy governor's special award went to the late
Lucille Ball. Her frequent co-star Bob Hope entered to a standing
ovation and introduced a string of film clips from Miss Ball's
career, which included the television shows ``I Love Lucy,'' ``The
Lucy Show,'' and ``Here's Lucy.''
   ``Lucy loved her work and loved the television industry,'' said
the comedian's widower, Gary Morton, in accepting the award. ``You
made the Lucy I love very happy, and she would have been very
touched by this symbol.''
   ``Cheers'' won best comedy series, and shy bartender Woody
Harrelson and brassy barmaid Rhea Perlman, both laboring at the
television tavern, won best supporting players in a comedy series.
   ``This really puts you in a good mood,'' exclaimed Miss Perlman,
who claimed her fourth Emmy in the supporting category. She thanked
her fellow performers and exited as the camera focused on her
beaming husband, Danny DeVito.
   Harrelson was not present at the awards in the Pasadena Civic
Auditorium, but a clever ``dramatization'' using his still portrait
with the lips electronically manipulated to express his gratitude.

   Larry Drake, who portrays the mentally retarded office worker
Benny Stulwicz of ``L.A. Law,'' and Melanie Mayron, the unmarried
man-hunter in ``thirtysomething,'' won Emmys for best supporting
actor and actress in a drama series.
   For Drake it was the second Emmy in a row, and he remarked, ``I'd
like to thank everyone I thanked last year.'' He added the names of
his agents, ``Because I promised them.''
   ``Oh, God, I hope my dress stays up,'' remarked Miss Mayron, who
thanked her co-workers at ``thirtysomething'' _ ``The best support a
girl from Philadelphia could have.''
   ``Lonesome Dove,'' the CBS miniseries that starred Robert Duvall
and Tommy Lee Jones scored the highest number of Emmy nominations in
non-technical categories _ 18, followed by NBC's frequent winner
``L.A. Law'' with 17, and ABC's miniseries ``War and Remembrance''
with 15.
   ABC's ``The Wonder Years'' had 14 nominations, ABC's
``thirtysomething'' hd 13, and NBC's ``The Golden Girls'' and Fox's
``The Tracey Ullman Show'' had 10 nominations each.
   ``Lonesome Dove'' was a big winner before Sunday night's event,
taking six Emmys in technical categories in non-televised ceremonies
Saturday night. The miniseries won prizes for costume design,
makeup, music composition, sound editing, sound mixing and casting.
   Before the success of ``Lonesome Dove,'' the Western had been
largely moribund for well over a decade on both the big and small
screen. This fall will mark the first time in 15 years that two
Westerns have been on the network schedule _ CBS' ``Paradise,'' in
its second year, and the new show ``The Young Riders'' on ABC. In
1958-59, by contrast, the top four shows were all Westerns:
``Gunsmoke,'' ``Wagon Train,'' ``Have Gun, Will Travel'' and ``The
Rifleman.''
   Thirteen other shows, including ``thirtysomething'' and ``The
Tracey Ullman Show,'' won two technical Emmys each.
   Sunday night's spectacle marked the end of a three-year contract
between the Television Academy and newcomer Fox. The 1987 show was a
ratings disaster. Last year's Nielsens showed improvement but still
embarrassed academy officials.
   ``This year should be much better,'' predicted John Moffit,
co-executive producer of the Emmycast. ``Fox has been very strong on
Sunday night.'' Last week's ratings showed Fox's ``Married ... with
Children'' in the 17th position and ``Totally Hidden Video'' in 33rd.
   Fox, the academy and the producers also sent letters to and
called the nominees to try to prevent a repeat of 1988's parade of
no-shows. Designated accepter Tony Danza came to the stage so many
times he finally exclaimed, ``What's the matter with you people?
Where are you?''

<TEXT>
   Production designers Moffit and Pat Tourk Lee strove for a new
look and a tighter show at the 41st annual Emmys. Gone were the
meaningless production numbers and the endless number of nominee
clips. But Moffit admitted that certain elements cannot be
regulated, particularly the acceptance speeches.
   ``We urged the nominees to be scintillating and succinct in their
acceptances,'' said the veteran producer-director. ``You always hope
for that spontaneous reaction, like when Alan Alda won a writing
award and did a cartwheel on his way to the stage.''
   There was hope among academy executives that the Emmycast would
return to one of the three major networks for a ratings rejuvenation
next year when bidding reopens. However, Fox has the right of first
refusal before ABC, CBS, NBC and others can enter the bidding
process.
   One reason Emmy ratings plummeted while on Fox was that the young
network's coverage of the country is far less than that of the big
three networks. Many TV academy officials think their annual Emmy
show deserves broader exposure.
   Strong counter-programming was the rule of thumb Sunday night on
the three major networks. ABC scheduled the Jack Nicholson-Kathleen
Turner hit movie ``Prizzi's Honor.'' CBS scheduled a preview of its
new fall shows and the Steve Martin-Daryl Hannah film comedy
``Roxanne.'' NBC struck back with reruns of the ``Family Ties''
finale and ``Bionic Showdown.''

   Leslie S. Victor adorned his office wall with a
portrait of himself as a monarch, complete with a crown and royal
finery.
   But to authorities unraveling a corporate bankruptcy case, he is
nothing but the king of con _ a man who may have embezzled $50
million or more from investors, banks and companies he controlled.
   After following a paper trail through U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
investigators say they are dealing with an avid gambler and
extravagant spender, a deceiver who practiced law without a license
and falsely represented himself as a certified public accountant.
   ``He's a brilliant but degenerate individual,'' said Martin
Pollner, the court-appointed trustee of the bankruptcy case.
   He also is missing. He disappeared after spending the weekend of
July 22 gambling in Atlantic City, N.J., with $200,000 embezzled
from a Connecticut bank a few days earlier, Pollner said.
   He left behind evidence of an opulent lifestyle.
   According to authorities, Victor spent $500,000 for a party at
Manhattan's Pierre Hotel for his 10th wedding anniversary. He
shopped for $2,500 suits and $500 ties at a store where appointments
are required. In one day, he spent $350,000 for jewelry at Cartier.
   His $5,000-a-month apartment, now sealed by court order, is
filled with Japanese art and oriental rugs, Pollner said.
   Victor was the vice president and sole operating officer of the
corporations in the bankruptcy case _ seven companies under the
umbrella of Maruki USA Co. Inc. and funded mainly by Japanese
investors.
   The companies, which went into bankruptcy proceedings last year,
owned dozens of restaurants across the United States and in England
as well as a restaurant equipment leasing firm. Until his
disappearance, Victor reported to Pollner each day, guiding the
companies through the bankruptcy process.
   Pollner said the fraud by Victor was uncovered as accountants and
private investigators tried to untangle Maruki's finances and find
money to pay back its many creditors.
   Three major schemes emerged, he said. In one, Victor persuaded
hundreds of people to invest in non-existent real estate
partnerships by promising tax shelters and profitable returns. The
investors, from all walks of life, gave Victor anywhere from $15,000
to $600,000, Pollner said.
   Pollner said Victor also defrauded banks of millions of dollars
by using phony documents to get financing for restaurant equipment
never purchased.
   Victor also allegedly diverted millions from the Maruki companies
to casinos to pay his massive gambling debts.
   ``He is tremendous in terms of convincing people of his
credibility,'' Pollner said. ``I think he's one of the greatest con
men of the century.''
   In Victor's Manhattan office, Pollner found letterhead and
business cards falsely identifying Victor as a lawyer and certified
public accountant. He said Victor apparently illegally practiced
both professions.
   Little information was available about Victor's background except
that he was born in Brooklyn. His personal papers list two different
dates of birth, one in 1939 and one in 1943. His wife, Cheryl, was
in Italy at the time of Victor's disappearance, according to The New
York Times.
   John Drucker, Victor's lawyer, said he could not comment on
Pollner's allegations.
   Joe Valiquette, an FBI spokesman, declined to discuss details of
Victor's life. The bureau was called into the case after Victor's
flight; a worldwide alert was issued for Victor's arrest on
bankruptcy fraud charges on July 26.
   ``He certainly has the means to travel anywhere in the world,''
Valiquette said.

<HEAD>Judge Gives up Bench for TV Anchor's Chair</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>

   A judge who is about to swap the bench for the
bright lights of television news says there is not much difference
between the two careers.
   ``A judge works to get the facts concerning a situation and puts
them together in the form of a verdict and delivers it to an
audience _ the jury,'' said Dallas District Judge Catherine Crier,
who will turn in her gavel next month to become a Cable News Network
anchor.
   ``I would say the parallels are considerable.''
   The 34-year-old judge, the youngest woman ever elected to the
Texas bench, is known in courthouse circles for her no-nonsense
demeanor.
   Ms. Crier, who has handled a range of felony cases, leaves the
courthouse Sept. 30, and CNN officials said she could be on the air
the middle next month.
   She has no news experience, but learned to like the public
spotlight while giving speeches in the legal community.
   ``I have been doing quite a bit of public speaking since my
pre-campaign days,'' Ms. Crier said in an interview last week. ``I
started to think of a way I might be able to combine my careers.''
   She hired Jack Hubbard, a former talent scout with CBS, as her
agent. Hubbard helped make a videotape of her delivering the news
and took it to Atlanta-based CNN.
   ``Considering the number of tapes we receive, when I open the box
I expect to see someone I don't want to hire,'' said Paul Amos, CNN
executive vice president of programming. ``And the fact that she
didn't have any news experience didn't help. But when I saw the tape
I realized Judge Crier had real potential.''
   Amos said Ms. Crier's legal background and public speaking work
has left her better prepared than most new anchors.
   In college, actor Ryan O'Neal proclaimed Ms. Crier one of the
University of Texas' 10 most beautiful women. She graduated from
Southern Methodist University law school, then became a prosecutor.
She has been on the bench since 1984, when she defeated incumbent
Judge Dee Brown Walker.
   Some district court colleagues support her career change.
   ``I was totally unprepared to hear that she was entering a career
in electronic journalism,'' said Judge Harold Entz. ``But I think
her career opportunity is very exciting, and I look forward to
following her career with CNN. She will be a great journalist
because she is a strong ethical advocate.''
   Judge Ron Chapman said, ``It's kind of ironic she will probably
be making three times what she makes as a judge.''
   As a judge, Ms. Crier is paid $87,250 a year. She and CNN
declined to say what she'll make there.
   She earned a ``B'' average in the annual report card poll by the
Dallas Bar Association. Eighty percent of 725 attorneys surveyed
gave Ms. Crier good marks for impartiality, hard work and correctly
applying the law. About 20 percent did not approve of her overall
performance.
   Amos said CNN is confident she'll be well-received. He isn't
worried about her lack of experience.
   ``I could hire an anchor with 10 years of experience in the top
five markets in the country and it would be a risk because you never
know who will make it,'' he said. ``But the people who reap the
greatest rewards are those who take risks.''

   Holly Hunter, winner of an Emmy as best
actress in a drama special for ``Rowe vs. Wade,'' spoke out
backstage for abortion rights, but the movie's writer called it a
story that takes no sides.
   ``I think this is an award for the drama, not the politics,''
said Alison Cross, co-producer and writer ``Roe vs. Wade,'' which
shared the Emmy for outstanding drama special.
   ``I don't think the Academy gave us this award as a pro-choice
statement,'' she said.
   Cross, forced by NBC to rewrite the script 20 times _ ostensibly
to remove any editorial viewpoint _ said, ``We tried very hard to
make this as good a show as possible and not make compromises
necessary for television.''
   The show told the story of Norma McCorvey, the real life ``Jane
Roe'' whose U.S. Supreme Court case established a woman's legal
right to abortion.
   In her acceptance speech, Hunter, who portrayed the McCorvey
character, thanked her for ``continuing to fight and keep women from
being second-class citizens and for refusing to give up her right
for reproductive choice.''
   Backstage, she reiterated her views and said, in an answer to a
question, that ``Roe vs. Wade'' did not take a middle-of-the-road
stance.
   ``It couldn't be right down the middle,'' she said. ``The story
was following a woman fighting for a pro-choice right.''
   ``Roe vs. Wade'' was not the only winner inspired by news
headlines.
   Writer Abby Mann, who won for his, ``Murderers Among Us: The
Simon Wiesenthal Story,'' criticized the TV industry for not
addressing serious subjects more frequently.
   ``The industry as a whole is terribly cowardly and ignorant
toward those subjects,'' he said, ``and I'm ashamed of it.''
   He said his next project is a book on the McMartin preschool
molestation trial, which he hopes will become a movie.
   Actor Larry Drake, who won for his role of a mentally retarded
man on ``L.A. Law,'' said his award meant more because his character
is ``well received'' by the mentally retarded community.
   Producer and writer David Rintels, whose ``Day One,'' the story
of the making of the first U.S. atomic bomb, tied with ``Roe vs.
Wade'' for outstanding drama special, said it was a hard fight
getting the show on the air
   ``It took 4{ half years,'' he said. ``It took some courageous
support from the network (CBS). It was thrilling that we had the
resources and support to do it the way we wanted.''
   Even the comedy winners seemed in a serious mood this year. They
spoke of their surprise at winning and how worthy their opponents
were.
   Rhea Perlman, who won as best supporting actress for the fourth
time for her role in, ``Cheers,'' wasn't cheering. ``I don't think
anybody deserves it this many times,'' she said.
   Diane English, who won for writing ``Murphy Brown,'' wondered
aloud about how her Emmy would boost the show's sale price in the
television syndication market.
   And Richard Mulligan, who won for his lead role in ``Empty
Nest,'' wasn't in a joking mood either. ``I don't know that I'm a
funny person,'' he said. ``Billy Crystal is funny. Robin Williams is
funny. I'm just an actor who can get it on.''

   There should be an Emmy for Sunday's prime-time
Emmy awards show. It was workmanlike, had some funny bits, some
surprises, and moved along smartly for the most part. It also
included a miracle.
   It ended five minutes early.
   Never, ever have I seen this happen with an awards show,
particularly the Emmy awards show. It tends to be television's
equivalent of the Long March. Not so Sunday's 41st annual exercise
in tube tribute.
   Broadcast by Fox Broadcasting, the two-hour, 55-minute Emmyganza,
conducted on a set full of stylized, blue and mauve mockups of old
TV sets, was a model of painless awarding.
   Produced by John C. Moffitt and Pat Tourk Lee, and crisply
directed by Walter Miller, Sunday's show could have been a nightmare
in nostalgia, having warned beforehand that it would have a
50th-anniversary-of-TV theme.
   But the clips of TV's past and present were well-chosen. They
were run in various well-edited categories, such as TV wives, where
one could marvel at the contrast between yesteryear's very proper
``The Donna Reed Show'' with today's rowdy ``Married...With
Children.''
   The acceptance speeches, by and large, were over with quickly,
and only one acting winner, Dana Delany of ABC's ``China Beach,''
was heard to say, ``I would first like to thank my agent.''
   And, while ``Lonesome Dove'' star Robert Duvall, an Emmy
presenter, predictably joked about poking along, there was an
amazing development as the night wore on. It had been thought that
CBS' high-rated Old West miniseries would get the major Emmys. It
didn't, save for best-direction honors.
   Early on, the Emmy show took sly digs at such things as the bits
of ``simulation'' and story ``dramatization'' that this year have
slipped into some network news programs.
   Example: Robert Altman wasn't on hand for his Emmy for directing
``Tanner '88.'' However, Duvall told viewers, ``ABC has been kind
enough to furnish us with an exclusive acceptance simulation.''
   There ensued a black-and-white videotaped scene of street corner
late at night. There, a lady in a trench coat furtively slipped the
Emmy to a man in a trench coat. There was no time code running on
the videotape, so I'm inclined to think it was from ABC's
enterainment division or something.
   Not all the joshing of AWOL awardees worked, though. One, for
absent winner Carroll O'Connor, had an actor mumbling from within
his knight's suit of armor. That made no sense, not even for TV.
   But on balance, Emmy night was a pretty good night, as these
things go, with Milton Berle closing it by reminding those who
didn't win to ``just remember, there's always radio.''
   Fox, which filched Emmy night from the CBS, NBC and ABC networks
and now has broadcast it three consecutive years, must decide
whether to re-up for a fourth year or yield this festival of statues
back to the big three.
   No matter what happens, remember one thing: On Sunday night,
Emmys awards in separate categories even went to the Grammy and Tony
award shows of last season.
   If they can give awards to other award shows, maybe next year
they can give an Emmy for Sunday's show. That might sound strange,
an awards show awarding itself for achievement.
   But that is the magic of television.

   Virginia Lt. Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, trying to
become the nation's first black elected governor, says his bid for
office should be viewed as an ``arithmetic progression'' rather than
a referendum on his race.
   Sitting in his campaign headquarters in suburban McLean, Va.,
Wilder insisted that his election would send a message ``more
important'' than trumpeting the success of a black man from
Richmond, capital of the old Confederacy.
   At the same time, it was clear during a recent interview that
Wilder is aware of the historical significance of his spot at the
head of the Democratic ticket in a state capital where blacks were
for so long barred from the political and social corridors of power.
   He talked of how a close friend, State Sen. Madison Marye, a
white man with a rich Southern drawl, quipped that ``my grandfather
was a Confederate army captain ... and your granddaddy was a slave.''
   Still, he shies away from emphasizing race.
   ``The important thing is that it sends a message that says you
don't have to be connected politically, you don't have to be born to
money,'' Wilder said.
   And that, he said, is a worthwhile message for young people of
all races.
   ``You see, a lot of times, unfortunately, everyone believes the
other guy's got it made: `I'm the only one that has a hard time
because I'm black, but every white person in the world has got it
made,''' he said. ``And you know, I don't have to tell you, it's
silly.''
   Determined to stake out his own identity _ one not marked by race
_ Wilder said he does not want Jesse Jackson to campaign for him as
he seeks to move from No. 2 to No. 1 in Virginia.
   ``It's not a rejection of Jackson,'' he said. ``I think Jesse is
an activist. ... I have been involved with compromises _ getting
half the loaf when you couldn't get the whole loaf. I don't want to
walk away empty-handed.''
   Wilder said his style of political accommodation with adversaries
``forces you to a broader constituency'' and that while serving as
the only black in the Virginia Senate, he came under pressure
``because people thought I was representing black Virginia.''
   But times have changed in the state, he said, ``so that what you
have now is what I call a new mainstream, and I'm a part of it.''
   ``Most people that I come in contact with are interested in where
we go from here,'' he said. ``(They) don't give a rip about the
past. ... It's rather poetic, and ironic.''
   He does plan to have comedian Bill Cosby appear at a fund-raising
event _ ``because he's an entertainer'' _ but is not having any
political figures from outside.
   Wilder said that attempts by Republican opponent J. Marshall
Coleman to depict him as a Michael Dukakis-type liberal won't work.
   ``I'm not a Mike Dukakis,'' he said. ``I have a record and a
proven record. The American people really never knew Dukakis. And
this has nothing to do with disparaging Michael Dukakis.''
   Wilder supported Dukakis for president last November, but stayed
neutral during the primary season. Jackson won the Virginia
Democratic presidential primary without Wilder's help.
   As he campaigns against Coleman _ a former attorney general with
a youthful, telegenic appearance _ Wilder acknowledged that he is
confronted with whispers that his efforts will be undermined by a
Labor Day weekend disturbance, mostly involving young blacks, in
Virginia Beach, Va.
   Asked whether his campaign would suffer because of the riots and
looting, Wilder replied, ``If I was an unknown quantity, maybe yes.
But people know me. They know that I would not tolerate that
nonsense ... and they don't look at me as a black lieutenant
governor. ... Somebody outside Virginia, who wouldn't know, might
think that.''
   Except for plenty of white hair showing the passage of time,
Wilder at 58 looks much the same as he did 20 years ago when first
elected to the Virginia Senate.
   He complained of news accounts resurfacing about a story that
arose during his 1985 campaign for lieutenant governor _ accounts of
his ownership of an allegedly dilapidated building in Richmond.
Wilder denied anew that the building was a slum, said no one had
been living there, that he had it repaired and transferred the
mortgage to a trust with himself as the beneficiary, to put the
issue behind him.
   He said the building never was cited as a ``public nuisance,''
despite a grand jury investigation, and insisted he had gone
undergone intense press scrutiny on the matter.

<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is
exaggerating his political problems _ warning of economic trouble
and a possible coup against himself _ in a bid to consolidate his
power, some U.S. analysts say.
   ``There has been a deliberate creating of a sense of crisis so
that he can undercut the conservatives,'' said Jerry Hough, a
scholar of Soviet affairs at Duke University.
   U.S. government analysts divide into two main camps on
Gorbachev's troubles, which stem from severe shortages of consumer
and other goods and nationalist movements that have gained steam
with the relaxation of political controls.
   Conservatives at the Pentagon, the Central Intelligence Agency
and some universities are warning the Bush administration that
Gorbachev could fall victim to a conservative reaction, jeopardizing
proposed agreements on arms control and human rights.
   Those agreements will come under discussion on Thursday and
Friday at a meeting in Wyoming between Secretary of State James A.
Baker III and his Soviet counterpart, Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   The conservative viewpoint has found an outlet in the speeches of
Defense Secretary Richard Cheney and public writings of Peter
Reddaway, a political scientist at George Washington University in
Washington.
   ``The Soviet Union is drifting toward a state of anarchy in which
it is going to be difficult to assert political control,'' said
Reddaway.
   However, the State Department and some analysts at CIA take a
more moderate view, placing little credence in warnings of a
conservative coup or predictions of a popular uprising against
Gorbachev, such as that forecast by Soviet political maverick Boris
N. Yeltsin in New York and Baltimore last week.
   ``We tend to think that there has been a lot of hysteria, that
Gorbachev is in a stronger position than the pessimists have been
saying,'' said one government official, espousing the moderate view
and speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The administration, so far guided by the moderate view of Soviet
politics, is moving to ``lock in some Soviet positions that we have
not seen before'' in arms control and human rights,'' said one State
Department source.
   But the skeptics have the ear of President Bush, persuading him
last week to avoid an Oval Office meeting with Yeltsin, who has
emerged as Gorbachev's most prominent critic.
   Yeltsin met instead with White House national security adviser
Brent Scowcroft. Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle stopped in for a
15-minute chat with Yeltsin, but the White House did not release its
customary photograph of the event.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater explained that the
administration did not want to provide Yeltsin a ``platform for
dissidence.''
   For the United States, Reddaway said in a recent interview, ``the
best policy is one of keeping very quiet.''
   ``What is going to happen is rather unpredictable and the United
States does not want to get branded with responsibility in any way
for what is going on,'' Reddaway said.
   Recent talk of a coup was kindled by Andrei D. Sakharov, the
Nobel peace laureate and member of parliament, who warned in an
article published July 30 in the weekly Ogonyok that ``any tragic
thing is possible.''
   ``I think that a right-wing coup is possible ... A military coup
is also possible in such a situation,'' Sakharov wrote.
   Sakharov's remarks came on the heels of a Communist Party Central
Committee meeting at which party stalwarts, whose authority has been
undercut by Gorbachev, expressed fears that the situation was
spinning out of control.
   Gorbachev further fanned the fires in a speech Sept. 9 saying he
faced threats from both sides.
   ``It is a fact that some people would like to create in this
society an atmosphere of alarm, a feeling that there is no way out,
a feeling of uncertainty,'' he said.
   ``In this multi-voice choir, we can hear threats of approaching
chaos and talk of a threatened coup, and even of civil war,''
Gorbachev said.

<HEAD>Energy Secretary Struggling to Set New Course for Nuclear Weapons
Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six months after taking command of the Energy
Department and vowing to steer its nuclear weapons program out of
troubled seas, retired Adm. James D. Watkins is spending as much
time bailing water as setting the new course.
   The latest crisis was a threat last week that the Rocky Flats
weapons plant near Denver would be shut down because of acknowledged
illegal storage of waste from plutonium processing. The plant is a
critical link in the nuclear arms production chain.
   Rockwell International Corp., which operates the plant under a
government contract, decided over the weekend to delay a decision on
closing the plant so officials can work on a plan to bring the
plant's waste storage into compliance.
   Also last week, Watkins faced a court order _ eventually
withdrawn _ to appear before a federal judge in Ohio to help resolve
a dispute over a $78 million settlement of a lawsuit by neighbors of
a weapons plant near Cincinnati that Watkins acknowledges is
violating environmental regulations.
   U.S. District Judge S. Arthur Spiegel backed down after Watkins
refused to testify, but the judge said he saw ``confusion and
indecision at the highest level'' of the department.
   Before that it was Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus closing his state's
borders to shipments of radioactive waste from Rocky Flats, a move
that could force Watkins to halt production at the Colorado plant as
early as next March. Andrus acted after the department failed to
open a waste repository in New Mexico as scheduled.
   One day before that, a federal judge in Washington stopped
Watkins from awarding a $10 billion contract to Bechtel National
Inc. to manage a proposed high-level nuclear waste dump in Nevada.
   At the same time, Watkins was negotiating with Westinghouse
Electric Corp. over a timetable for completing repairs to the idled
Savannah River nuclear reactors in South Carolina that are the
nation's only source of tritium gas used in nuclear warheads.
   All this happened in the space of two weeks _ bursts of political
fallout from years of government neglect of a bomb-producing system
that congressional auditors recently called one of the most
dangerous industrial complexes in the world.
   Watkins has spent much of his first half-year as energy secretary
managing crises in virtually every part of the nuclear weapons
program: reactor breakdowns, lawsuits by citizens and states,
setbacks in waste storage, lapses in security at top-secret weapons
labs, plant raids by the FBI and money fights with Congress.
   A strapping, articulate man who usually projects a strong sense
of self-confidence, Watkins last week sounded frustrated and
unsettled by his inability so far to accomplish the turnaround he
promised when he took the job in March.
   ``I have been overwhelmed by the breadth and depth of the
problems'' in the weapons program, Watkins told an advisory group,
adding that no one in the Bush administration, including the
president, realized how long it would take to fix it.
   ``I don't think either of us had a feel'' for the complexity of
the problems, he said, nor the significance of a department morale
problem that Watkins attributed to the Reagan administration's
attempts to abolish the department.
   ``What we have is eight years of a department sitting there
waiting to be canceled for lack of interest, so there's a lack of
zeal'' among the workers, he said.
   Watkins declined requests for an interview, but aides are quick
to defend his record.
   ``We're beginning to see signs of change,'' said Henson Moore,
the deputy secretary. ``We haven't changed the attitudes overnight,
and we knew they wouldn't be.''
   Recent disclosures of waste management problems at many weapons
plants _ including alleged illegal burning of hazardous wastes at
Rocky Flats _ also are causing turmoil among the private companies
that run the plants under government contracts.
   Watkins said some of these contractors are having second thoughts
about renewing their contracts.
   ``There is a period of confusion with our contractors, who don't
know whether or not they're going to go to jail'' for the alleged
environmental violations, he said.
   Watkins isn't giving up the ship. In a memorandum to all
department employees Sept. 5, he outlined a ``new course'' that he
said must be established for the department ``as quickly as
possible.'' Among the items he singled out for ``special corrective
action'' was the system for reporting accidents and other events
affecting the environment, health, safety or security.
   ``Crisis management, after the fact, has become the norm too
often,'' Watkins wrote.

   House Minority Leader Robert Michel is cleaning
out his desk and filing cabinets _ but that doesn't mean he's giving
up leadership of the apparently perpetual Republican minority.
   ``To the contrary, I hope to be creating even more documents,''
Michel said as he announced earlier this month he is turning over
three decades worth of political papers, documents, pictures and
memorabilia to the Everett McKinley Dirksen Congressional Research
Center at Pekin, Ill.
   Michel used the occasion to talk about leadership in the House,
about the congressional leaders he has known, and about the woes and
challenges of leading the GOP minority as he has since 1980.
   Republicans last held a House majority in 1954, two years before
Michel first was elected to Congress from Illinois.
   The minority leader opened with Dirksen, the Illinois Republican
who served as Senate minority leader during the 1960s.
   ``There are those who say he wanted to be on the stage,'' Michel
noted. ``I think he was a better actor than the late Sir Laurence
Olivier. Ev had flair. He had a sense of the dramatic, a feel for
the shifting mood of an audience, an uncanny sense of timing.
   ``He had a carefully constructed political image, before the word
`image' became popular in politics. His hai, said to be combed each
morning with an egg beater, was his trademark.
   ``He loved to put words together in a bill and votes together on
the floor.''
   Completing that thumbnail sketch, Michel turned to others:
   _House Speaker Sam Rayburn Of Texas: ``...alone, aloof,
majestical, although not tall in stature he was every inch the
Speaker of the House _ and everybody knew it.''
   _House Minority Leader Joe Martin, R-Mass.: ``Like Rayburn he was
a bachelor, married to the House.''
   _Speaker John McCormick, D-Mass.: ``He was always pulling from
his coat pockets wrinkled papers and folded documents. I can see him
now, waving them like a trial lawyer at his opponents in debate.''
   _House Minority Leader Charles Halleck, R-Ill.: ``A firebrand,
aggressive, red-faced, mixing it up in debate on the floor...''
   As minority leader, Michel says he has come to believe that
rivalry between Republicans and Democrats is not the most important
division he has to face.
   ``More important at times are liberal-conservative differences,
regional differences, differences among states, factions within
parties, fights between communities over `turf,' and, of course, the
435 different personalities, ambitions, dreams and character flaws.''
   ``Each of these groups interacts with the others in a constantly
shifting, volatile mixture of emotions and ambitions and ideals,''
Michel said and noted:
   ``A personal grudge, a secret ambition, a hidden motive, an
unspoken agreement, can all mean more on a given issue than partisan
differences. A House leader has to know these things.''
   But there also has to be communication in every direction, an
ability to leap into debate on a moment's notice and, Michel says,
an ability to stop speaking, stop communicating _ and simply listen.
   Michel is a political moderate. As he sees it, the House does not
``lend itself to the theoretical abstraction of ideologues.''
   ``Ideological activists believe they know the truth and they
don't want to negotiate or compromise or even talk about
compromise,'' he said. ``But in the House the ability to strike a
wise compromise is an essential part of leadership.''
   There has to be an understanding, he said, that there are times
that subtle maneuvers can succeed where a frontal attack will almost
certainly fail.
   Most members of the House, he said, don't want their leaders
sending them into unwinnable battles.
   Members of the House _ and their leaders in particular _ are the
nation's most exposed national politicians, closest to the people,
up for re-election every two years, both ears always open to the
sound of social and economic change, Michel says.
   ``We don't have four years like a president or six years like a
senator to hide our mistakes,'' Michel said. ``We serve as a kind of
distant early-warning system for democracy. We are ever aware of new
problems.
   ``And we are also aware of the clumsy legislative means at our
disposal to deal with those problems,'' he said.

   The last of a band of fugitive monkeys are
leading captors on wild goose chases as they make themselves at home
in upstate New York.
   About 80 Japanese macaque monkeys swam from the Parc Safari game
preserve in Quebec to Clinton County in northeastern New York in
June. Most were quickly rounded up and returned to Canada, but the
remaining primates have been making monkeys out of their would-be
captors.
   One went window shopping in downtown Mooers recently and three
led searchers through a fast-food restaurant in the hamlet of
Champlain. One fell into a 45-gallon vat of french-fry grease. That
one didn't slip away, however.
   ``We know where they're at, and we've got a 95 percent chance of
getting them all back,'' said Dan Kyle, co-owner of the game park.
``There are three adults and two infants left.''
   The monkeys have been holed up along a highway between Mooers and
Champlain, sponging tidbits from passers-by, said Kyle, who promised
to round up the rest of the fugitives soon.

   Love comes and goes, but some love notes can
last a long time.
   Cindy Skinner, 16, was giving a customer change at a convenience
store when she spotted a dollar bill that served as a startling
reminder of a crush she and her best friend had on the same boy _
seven years ago.
   Miss Skinner and Dianna Braun, 16, decided to tell the world
about their crush on Timmy Anthamatten in 1982. They inscribed their
love for Timmy on separate dollar bills, but soon spent the money on
candy.
   The Summer of '82 came thundering back when Miss Skinner spotted
Miss Braun's love note in the cash register.
   ``I said, `Oh my gosh!' I told my supervisor about it and we
switched dollar bills,'' Miss Skinner said.
   Miss Braun has framed the dollar bill in her bedroom.
   ``Now I'm looking for Cindy's dollar,'' Miss Braun said.

<HEAD>A Soviet Ethnic Dilemma: Why the Meskhetians Can't Go Home.</HEAD>

   Where the Kura River broadens from its
forested gorge into Meskhetia's tan fields, eight Soviet Georgians
wielding clubs block any ethnic Turks seeking to return to their
homeland.
   Policemen at a nearby checkpoint are happy for the help, just in
case the next bus is packed with Meskhetian Turks bent on violence
against Meskhetian Georgians.
   ``We don't know how many there will be, and if they'll be armed
or not,'' one officer said on condition of anonymity.
   Three hundred years as a Turkish province split Meskhetia, a
region in southern Georgia, into Georgian-speaking Christians and
Turkish-speaking Moslems.
   Then, in 1944, Josef Stalin had the Turks packed into cattle cars
and deported to Uzbekistan in Central Asia.
   Despite the officer's fears, it is the Turks who have been hacked
to pieces and burned alive in recent months. A pogrom in Uzbekistan
in June claimed 100 lives and sent thousands fleeing.
   But even after being uprooted for the second time in 45 years,
the Turks are barred from returning home. The Georgians and
Armenians living in Meskhetia are worried that an influx of Turks
might stir up centuries of Moslem-Christian feuding.
   Somehow, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev must resolve this
deadlock _ and at least 40 other deep-rooted ethnic conflicts
between the more than 130 nationalities peopling the Soviet Union _
if he hopes to hold the country together.
   On Tuesday, the Communist Party's policy-making Central Committee
opens a meeting devoted to ethnic problems following months of
strikes and ethnic unrest that for some Soviets herald the breakup
of the empire.
   The disputes are territorial, they involve political power, or
are matters of language, independence, religion, culture.
   Gorbachev has promised a special meeting of the party leadership
to solve the ethnic problems that have raged for more than 1{ years
since Azerbaijani-Armenian rioting in February 1988 that claimed 31
lives.
   On Aug. 17, the party issued its proposed solution, which was to
give more power to the republics and regions long dominated by
Moscow. The document also calls for legal guarantees of minority
rights and local self-government for small ethnic groups.
   There was not a word about the specific complaints of the peoples
of many regions in turmoil, including Meskhetia.
   ``We personally saw nothing there for us,'' Ibragim Medzhidoglu,
a Turkish refugee from Uzbekistan, said of the document.
   More power to autonomous republics would be helpful if the Turks
dominated Meskhetia, ``but the territory is closed to us,'' he said
in Moscow.
   While Communist leaders cast about for compromises, hundreds of
Meskhetian Turks are virtually camped in the once-tidy reception
area of the government Presidium in Moscow, where they make daily
appeals for aid. Most are among the 35,000 Meskhetians who fled the
violence in Uzbekistan.
   The petitioners are now adrift in the Soviet system with no jobs
and no homes, but with a fierce desire to return to Meskhetia.
   National authorities moved quickly to protect the Meskhetians
from well-organized attackers in Uzbekistan. Since then, they have
offered the Meskhetians refugee camps in the neighboring republic of
Azerbaijan, or cottages in central Russia and Byelorussia abandoned
by peasants moving to cities, said one man on condition of anonymity.
   ``Our goal is a peaceful route to regaining our homeland,'' he
said.
   The Meskhetians have been pleading to return to Georgia for
decades, signing hundreds of petitions. But returning is not as
simple as rescinding Stalin's order, which shipped more than 150,000
Meskhetian Turks to Central Asia in November 1944. Stalin allegedly
was convinced that Turkey was about to attack.
   Soviet residency permits are still tightly controlled, and tied
to existing jobs and scarce apartments.
   The Meskhetian Georgians _ some of whom moved into the Turks'
former homes _definitely don't want them back. They say their former
neighbors were also old enemies in a Moslem-Christian conflict based
more on rival cultures than on religion, and they recall relatives
killed and terrorized by the Turks.
   ``They killed, they robbed, they raped,'' said Avtandil
Diasamidze, an older man in the village of Vale. ``It was impossible
for a wife to take food to her husband working in the fields,
because the Turks would attack her.''
   Meskhetia was the cradle of Georgian civilization but became a
province of the Ottoman Turkish Empire for 300 years until the
Russian czar took over in the early 19th century.
   The landscape is a constant reminder of the conflict, with its
ruined watchtowers and mountaintops denuded of forests, reportedly
by Turks trying to burn out Georgian partisans hiding in the trees.
   Since the Moslem preference for large families has multiplied the
Meskhetian Turks to 360,000, compared to the 200,000 Christian
residents of Meskhetia, some Turks say their majority gives them the
right to demand the area be separated from Georgia.
   ``If we are allowed back, we will ask for autonomy,'' said Sattar
Iskandarov, a Meskhetian studying in Moscow who is taking part in
the vigil at the Presidium office.
   Some Turkish activists have even called for deporting Georgians
so the Turks can replace them, said Shalva Shanidze, Communist Party
chief in Akhaltsike, the largest city in Meskhetia.
   ``Why solve the first mistake with another?'' he said.
   A pre-pogrom plan to return several hundred Meskhetian Turkish
families to Meskhetia was scrapped after Georgians heard that some
Turks planned to demand autonomy, Shanidze said.
   ``Friction started when the Turks came and saw people had been
living for 45 years in their houses,'' Shanidze said. ``They came
and said, `This is our home. Throw them out.'''
   Besides, Shanidze said, ``we don't have enough land'' to support
hundreds of thousands of new residents, most of them farmers
demanding at least a garden plot if not fields to lease.
   With the way to their homeland blocked, some Meskhetian Turks are
seeking to emigrate to Turkey if the Soviet government will allow it.
   Sevki Mutevellioglu, first secretary of the Turkish Embassy in
Moscow, said 5,000 to 10,000 Meskhetians are seeking Soviet exit
visas to emigrate.
   ``To refuse them is out of the question,'' he said, even though
Turkey is already overwhelmed by refugees as Bulgaria expels tens of
thousands of its own ethnic Turks.
   Iskandarov, who wants to go to Turkey, said the violence in
Uzbekistan has left him with no faith that the Meskhetian Turks will
ever have a safe home among the Soviet people.

<HEAD>Unrealistic View of Rural Economy Harms Planning, Analyst Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A private think-tank analyst says development
of rural America has been hampered by a mistaken tendency to
associate the well-being of communities with farming.
   Secondly, says Louis E. Swanson in Resources Quarterly, there is
a false assumption that with the possible exception of farmers,
rural people are doing well.
   At least five factors have impaired rural policy development in
Congress and the federal bureaucracy, he said. These include:
   _An unrealistic, often romantic view of a bucolic rural economy
and society.
   _Serious limitations to existing social and economic data on
sparsely populated areas.
   _The treatment of rural America as a geographical entity
unconnected to the larger U.S. economy and society.
   _A perception that many rural areas do not have viable political
solutions.
   _The absence of a unified rural constituency and the presence of
a formidable opposition to renovated and new rural development
programs.
   A report by an Agriculture Department task force earlier this
year said the rural economy ``has difficulty keeping pace with
national economic growth'' because of the small size of communities,
isolation, unskilled labor and a lack of institutional support.
   The task force's recommendations, which are still under review by
USDA, said the department should begin by ``committing itself to
rural development'' as a major mission and should articulate clear
goals.
   One of Swanson's criticisms was that USDA and the network of
land-grant universities have been ``relatively passive opponents''
of rural development for many years.
   ``Their opposition has taken the form of neglect,'' he said.
``They define their mission as primarily to assist commercial
agriculture, and in so doing believe they help all rural people.''
   Swanson is an associate professor of sociology at the University
of Kentucky and was a resident fellow in the national center for
food and agricultural policy at Resources for the Future, a
non-profit independent organization that conducts research on the
development, conservation and use of natural resources and the
environment.
   In his report, Swanson said that rural America long ago shed its
overwhelming dependency on farming.
   For example, he noted, in 1984 most rural employment nationally
was accounted for by: manufacturing, 40 percent; services and trade,
16.5 percent; government, 13 percent; farming, 9 percent; and
mining, about 5.5 percent.
   ``Moreover, for the same year, farm families reported that more
than 60 percent of their net family income came from off-farm jobs.''
   Of more than 3,000 counties in the United States, only 617 are
considered agriculturally dependent, he said. And those account for
less than 7 percent of the national population.
   ``By the late 1980s, then, the old axiom that farm well-being,
and by inference farm programs, determine rural well-being was no
longer useful,'' Swanson said. ``Certainly, some rural economies
continue to depend on farming, but this is the exception rather than
the rule.''
   As to the assumption that rural people, except for farmers, are
doing all right, Swanson said that claim has been based on reports
of rural population growth. Between 1973 and 1983, rural counties
did grow faster than urban counties, and many social experts
proclaimed a rural renaissance.
   ``However, most of the population growth was due to a combination
of residential mobility and natural population growth,'' he said.
``The former was simply part of the post-World War II process of
suburbanization, and not migration.''
   Swanson's and other studies are coming along just as Congress is
cranking up again for a shot at solving the problems of rural
America. Legislation for hastening rural development has cleared the
Senate, and the House is working on a version.
   Ironically, he said, it was the financial crunch on farmers
during the mid-1980s that spurred the renewed interest in rural
development.
   ``Since part of the problem was the assumption that farm
well-being determines rural community well-being, the reintroduction
of rural development in the context of a farm crisis had the effect
of reaffirming this assumption,'' Swanson said.
   ``The public still appears to associate farming with rural
well-being, and to believe that the farm programs of the past 50
years have helped farm families,'' he added. ``In fact, the evidence
is that these programs have facilitated the decline in the number of
family farms.''
   Rural development should be seen as part of a long-term national
strategy ``to upgrade our human resources while providing employment
opportunities and basic services,'' Swanson said. ``Unfortunately,
neither Congress nor the general public appears to be willing to
make such a long-term national commitment.''

<TEXT>
   The whistle of steam locomotives has
returned to the South Rim, and officials say it could usher in a
cleaner era at the crowded Grand Canyon overlook.
   The Grand Canyon Railway was to haul its first paying passengers
today over the 64 miles from Williams to the South Rim, 88 years
after the first train chugged over the sinous route leading from
pine forests to the blood-red sandstone of the canyon.
   The railway, which resumed its run Sunday, restores service that
was ended in 1968; since then most of the 3.5 million annual
visitors to the rim have arrived by automobile.
   The railroad plans weekend service until November and daily
service next year, using only steam locomotives over a route that
the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad considered the toughest
on its system when it was completed in 1901.
   The railway plans to build a 400-room hotel, a
turn-of-the-century theme park and an American Indian cultural
center in Williams and later build a hotel near the Grand Canyon
airport at Tusayan, 10 miles south of the South Rim.
   An hourly train shuttle from the airport to the rim should reduce
pollution, said Max Biegert, the railroad's developer. A recent
Northern Arizona University study predicted that train ridership
could reduce motor traffic to the rim by 40 percent.
   Biegert said he expects the line to carry 135,000 passengers next
year and up to 500,000 annually in years to come, providing jobs for
about 800 people.
   On Sunday's inaugural ride, about 500 people including Gov. Rose
Mofford rode aboard seven 80-foot-long Harriman Coach cars that
recalled the glamor of turn-of-the-century railroading.
   Mofford hailed the development as an economic boost to the
northern Arizona, while Eugene Hughes, the president of Northern
Arizona University in nearby Flagstaff, waxed sentimental.
   ``As a child my visions of exotic travel were always likened to
the railroads,'' he said.``In an era of jet lag and frenetic
freeways, it's nice to know that a person can slow down the pace of
things to what they used to be.''
   The Williams depot, a teal-gray, one-story addition to the
historic Fray Marcos Hotel, was bedecked with red-white-and-blue
bunting.
   People turned out in traditional Old West garb: the women in
gingham dresses and men in vests, neckerchiefs and canvas breeches
called ``duckins.'' The trip began in part of the nation's largest
stand of ponderosa pine, moved past the cones of dormant volcanoes
and onto the austere plains of the Colorado Plateau, ending with a
series of switchbacks.
   At the northern terminus, only 200 yards from the rim, the
passengers took part in a spike-driving ceremony and briefly viewed
the canyon before the return trip.
   Planners believe the railroad, an entirely private venture, will
encourage people to spend more time studying and hiking in the
canyon rather than gazing off the rim.

<HEAD>Oil Spill, Air Quality Legislation on Congress' Agenda</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House will focus this week on protecting
the nation's waters against oil spills, while a House subcommittee
considers President Bush's bill to improve America's air quality.
   Meanwhile, Republicans say they may propose a new strategy to pay
for the war on drugs. Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole said Sunday
the GOP could make a counter-offer to the Democrats' proposed $2.2
billion addition to President Bush's overall $7.9 billion anti-drug
plan.
   The oil spill legislation will be on the House floor Thursday,
just a week after Exxon finished its summer cleanup of the Exxon
Valdez accident off Prince William Sound, Alaska.
   The cleanup of the nation's worst oil spill ended with a dispute
over the extent of environmental recovery, and the legislation to
prevent future accidents is just as controversial.
   The shape of the legislation is still under negotiation. Two
competing bills would establish new shipping rules and make those
involved in oil transportation pay cleanup costs.
   But still unsettled is the most crucial issue: whether the
federal government will be allowed to pre-empt state laws, including
statutes in 17 states, that have no limits on liability for those
responsible for spills.
   The two bills would allow pre-emption, but environmental groups
and the National Governors' Association are trying to convince their
House supporters to let tougher state laws remain in effect. Reps.
George Miller, D-Calif., and Gerry Studds, D-Mass., are preparing an
amendment to establish minimum federal liability requirements but
permit states to enact tougher laws.
   Meanwhile, members of the House Energy and Commerce environment
subcommittee have finished listening to each other's opening
statements and are ready to consider amendments to Bush's clean air
bill.
   Battles are expected over the extent of auto emission
requirements, sharing the cost of acid rain reduction and strict
limits on utility growth after the year 2000.
   With just two weeks left before a new fiscal year begins,
Congress also is trying to pass a dozen money bills to keep the
government operating. But there's a major disagreement over how much
to spend to fight illegal drugs.
   Dole, speaking Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' said, ``I
don't think we find any problem in the president's package,'' and
added that other ways should be found to finance the plan than
Democrats' proposed across-the-board budget cuts.
   But Senate Judiciary Chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del., contends
there are ``glaring deficiencies'' in Bush's plan. He said Democrats
will be content only if the growth in the number of cocaine addicts
is reversed, drug treatment is provided for all who want it and drug
education is extended to nearly every school child in the country.
   A spending bill before the House would provide $270 million for
increased security and weapons detection systems at airports.
   The oil spill legislation approved by the Merchant Marine and
Fisheries Committee bill would establish a maximum $60 million
liability for owners and operators of vessels involved in spills.
Legislation approved by the Committee on Public Works and
Transportation would establish a $150 million cleanup liability.
   Those figures would apply when the spill is not caused by gross
negligence or willful misconduct. If there is gross negligence or
misconduct, there would be no liability limit.
   The Miller-Studds amendment would substantially increase the caps
on liability, allow unlimited liability for simple negligence rather
than gross negligence and allow states to enforce their own, tougher
laws.
   Less controversial provisions would toughen license requirements
for ship captains and pilots, set standards for qualifications of
crewmen on foreign tankers, establish studies of tanker navigation
safety standards, expand federal authority to assume command of
cleanups and require establishment of local contingency plans.
   An oil industry-financed fund would pay for cleanups and
compensate those who suffered losses when claims exceeded an
innocent spiller's liability.

<TEXT>
   NAGORNO-KARABAKH _ The predominantly Armenian population wants
control of this mountainous area to be transferred from
traditionally Moslem Azerbaijan to Christian Armenia. Over the past
18 months the dispute has led to 100 deaths in both republics, and
hundreds of thousands of people have fled their homes. To quell the
dispute, the Kremlin has imposed direct rule over the region.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   GEORGIA _ The republic neighboring Azerbaijan and Armenia in the
Caucasus Mountain region is beset by disputes between minority
Abkhazians demanding more autonomy and majority Georgians. There are
also disputes among many other small ethnic groups. Soviet soldiers
killed 20 people while breaking up a Georgian nationalist
demonstration in the capital of Tbilisi in April.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   FERGANA VALLEY _ One hundred people were killed, homes were
torched and thousands evcuated from eastern Uzbekistan in June in a
pogrom aimed mostly at minority Meskhetian Turks, who were forcibly
resettled from Georgia in the 1940s. Many say overcrowding and lack
of jobs caused the situation to explode.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   BALTICS _ The three Baltic republics, Lithuania, Latvia and
Estonia, have been pressing the Kremlin for greater autonomy. They
now want at minimum to serve as a laboratory for economic reform and
at maximum to regain the independence they had before being
incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1940.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   UKRAINE _ A newly unified grassroots political movement, the
Narodni Rukh, seeks to unify groups promoting political reform,
religious freedom and preservation of the Ukrainian language and
culture in the country's second-largest republic.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   MOLDAVIA _ Moldavians won the battle to have their language
declared the official one and to have the Latin alphabet replace
Cyrillic in the republic bordering Romania. The move met stiff
resistance from non-Moldavians, who struck factories and offices.
The republic was incorporated by Stalin in 1940.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ETHNIC GERMANS _ Thousands of ethnic Germans who have retained
their native language and culture despite having come to Russia in
czarist times are being allowed to emigrate to West Germany. Once
residents of a homeland on the Volga River, many were dispersed
during World War II to Kazakhstan and other areas farther east.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   KAZAKHSTAN _ President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's ethnic problems
broke into the open in December 1986 when the replacement of
Communist Party chief Dinmukhamed Kunaev, a Kazakh, with Russian
Gennady Kolbin sparked rioting. A parliamentary committee is looking
into claims that many more people died than the two reported.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   CRIMEAN TATARS _ Another group exiled by Stalin from their
homeland in the Crimean peninsula, the descendants of the Mongols
who terrorized medieval Russia are clamoring to return home. They
carried out a noisy demonstration on Red Square in July 1987.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   NATIONALITIES OF THE FAR NORTH _ Scholars and activists say many
very small ethnic groups of the far north are in danger of
disappearing or having their cultures ruined by the encroachment of
industrial development. Some groups have only a few thousand members.

<HEAD>Banks Ask International Bodies to Help Markets in Eastern Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A spokesman for major banks around the world is
urging the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to get
together to aid market forces in the Soviet Union and its east
European allies.
   ``The IMF and the World Bank should make a concerted effort to
promote change,'' said Horst Schulmann, managing director of the
Washington-based Institute of International Finance, which includes
major banks in the United States, Britain and other leading
financial countries.
   The IMF and World Bank are owned by 151 governments, with the
United States taking a major role in both. China and some East
European governments are members, but not the Soviet Union.
   ``These institutions can do more, particularly in advising how to
replace administrative controls with market mechanisms and through
the funding of structural adjustment efforts,'' Schulmann said.
   ``The IFC (International Finance Corp.) can also be helpful by
bringing together foreign investors and local enterprises,'' he said.
   The IFC, a part of the World Bank that lends to private business
rather than governments, already invests in Poland, Hungary and
Yugoslavia as well as in China. It also has a growing interest in
helping privatize industry owned by governments.
   Schulmann's statements were in a letter dated Sept. 12 to leaders
of World Bank and IMF, which also is headquartered in Washington.
Schulmann, a West German, was an adviser to former Chancellor Helmut
Schmidt.
   Schulmann's letter was made public today as representatives of
leading banks and the 151 governments began gathering for annual
meetings that will go on until the end of the month. Treasury
Secretary Nicholas F. Brady will be the chief U.S. representative,
and a speech from President Bush is on the schedule.
   Developments in eastern Europe are expected to be among the
topics. Another will be international debt and Brady's proposal for
reducing its burden on debtor countries. Poland and Yugoslavia are
among the major problem debtors.
   Member countries also will try to make progress on increasing the
fund's $118 billion in assets, which Managing Director Michel
Camdessus wants to see doubled.
   In recent years the fund's money has been used to help debtor
countries improve their financial positions. In a speech on
Thursday, Camdessus spoke of prospects for change in eastern Europe.
   ``This promises to be a major transformation which, if
successful, will bring large benefits, but there are serious
risks,'' he said. ``The challenge to these countries and to those
who should help them are enormous. What is certain, is that here we
must not fail.''
   Helping the Soviet Union and its allies adapt to western ways was
proposed last week as the task for the fund during the 1990s, in a
study by two U.S. experts. They were Catherine Gwin of the
Rockefeller Foundation and Richard E. Feinberg, executive vice
president of the Overseas Development Council, a private research
group. Both are former State Department officials.
   The World Bank's annual report, published Sunday, said a greater
role for markets in eastern Europe would mean a basic change of the
economic system. In many cases privatization would not be needed,
but rather competition where none existed before, it added.
   ``Trade reform and an opening of the economy to foreign
competition is often an important element in this process,'' it
said. ``Systemic reform in the socialist economies of the region
perhaps offers the greatest of challenges, given the major
structural changes required within their economies.''

<HEAD>Government Ends Locator Maintenance Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Surveyors, mapmakers and others who need to
know exactly where they are might find the task more difficult, now
that budget cuts are halting the maintenance of more than 1 million
place markers across the country.
   As a result, it may grow increasingly harder to set locations for
new building projects, says Max Ethridge, head of the National
Geodetic Survey.
   The ``geodetic reference system control points,'' showing the
exact latitude, longitude and elevation of a spot, were installed
over about a 150-year period, Ethridge said.
   But maintenance of those markers has been phased out over the
last 18 months, he said, following the elimination of 10 jobs and
the $550,000 budget for the work.
   ``As a result, I know that many are being destroyed. It's just a
matter of time and we will end up with fewer marks. Surveys will
have to cover larger distances to find base points to work from,''
Ethridge explained.
   Loss of marker points could complicate the job of setting
locations and elevations for new projects, he explained.
   The 3.5-inch diameter brass disks are set in concrete and are
used to determine the exact locations and directions of roads,
property lines, easements and other measurements.
   In addition, Ethridge added, the elevation information provided
by the markers is important in determining water drainage patterns.
   Ethridge said his agency, a part of the Commerce Department,
continues to establish new locator marks when needed in its effort
to determine the nation's exact dimensions and locations.
   But the problem arises when new roads, shopping centers or other
development occurs in a spot where a geodetic marker is already
located.
   In the past, when builders came across one of the markers they
contacted the NGS and it sent out a surveying team to relocate the
marker. That allowed the area to maintain a record of locations
because the relationship of the old and new benchmarks was known.
The agency also rechecked the elevations and locations of markers
and made corrections as necessary.
   It's that maintenance program that has fallen to the budget ax,
explained Ethridge.
   About half of the states have programs to relocate the markers on
their own, or at the county level, he said. However, not all use the
same standards as the federal agency, and in the other states
development can simply mean loss of the benchmark.
   Roy Mullen, associate chief of the national mapping division at
the U.S. Geological Survey, said the end of the NGS maintenance
program should have little effect on his agency, however.
   The Geological Survey's national mapping program is 90 percent
complete, Mullen said.
   The Geological Survey, a part of the Interior Department, has a
system of marker points of its own, but Mullen said these are
largely in areas not covered by the NGS system, or where that
system's markers were not close enough for accurate mapping. The NGS
markers are the basic national surveying system, he said.
   In recent years satellites have allowed scientists to make new
studies of the location of points on Earth, but earthbound
benchmarks are still needed for precise surveying, officials report.
   The National Geodetic Survey was formerly known as the Coast and
Geodetic Survey. Geodesy, from which the word geodetic is derived,
is the science of measuring the size and shape of the earth
including elevations and measurements of gravity at various
locations.

<HEAD>Pilots Under Fire at Rock Island Arsenal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL VOGRIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ROCK ISLAND, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two pilots who blew the whistle on
safety violations at the Rock Island Arsenal say they've been
grounded, discredited, and assigned to minor jobs in reprisal.
   The Army credits the two civilian pilots, Curt McRae, 40, and
Lloyd Williams, 50, with providing evidence that led to improvements
in safety, but arsenal officials deny any action has been taken to
punish the pilots.
   McRae's supervisors said he was grounded because of mental
instability, a claim McRae denies.
   ``I spent 13{ months in Vietnam with the Marines. That was a
cakewalk compared to what I've gone through at the arsenal,'' McRae
said in a recent interview. ``I put up with safety violations and
broken rules, and even participated myself, for six years because I
was afraid of losing my job.''
   The pilots' jobs involved flying Army brass, equipment and
dangerous chemicals and weapons across the country. The violations
they reported included failure to report minor aircraft accidents,
falsification of documents and unsafe transportation of hazardous
cargo.
   McRae made his first report in September 1987 on violations at
the flight detachment based at Quad City Airport in nearby Moline.
   Gen. Marvin Brailsford credited him with pointing out
``weaknesses in safety, management and operations'' at the flight
division.
   Disciplinary action was taken against supervisors, the flight
detachment was reorganized and new safety checks were added to daily
routine, said Brailsford, commander of the U.S. Army Armament,
Munitions and Chemical Command.
   But in October 1987, McRae was grounded. This past January, he
was told he would be fired. The firing has been suspended while the
Merit Systems Protection Board investigates.
   Since his grounding, McRae has sorted tools in a machine shop
while drawing his $39,100 annual pilot's pay.
   ``They want to make an example out of me,'' he said. ``They are
trying to destroy any chance I have for employability in the airline
industry.''
   Williams became involved in the case when, as an aviation safety
officer, he followed up on some of McRae's allegations.
   Williams grounded himself in June 1988, citing the stress of
standing up for McRae and testifying against his supervisors at Army
inquiries.
   Now Williams wants to fly. Although a flight surgeon and
psychiatrist found him fit to do so, he has not been recertified.
   ``The only reasonable explanation for my situation is reprisal
for whistleblowing,'' said Williams, who is working as a machinery
oiler in a lubrication division.
   Arsenal spokesman Al Schwartz said Williams' flight status is
under review and there is no move to fire him.
   Pilots who flew with McRae and Williams had divided opinions
about the case.
   Chuck Hanna, who recently retired from the arsenal, described the
two as ``a couple of fellows trying to get their boss' job.''
   Hanna said a personality conflict between McRae and Neil Pobanz,
chief of the flight detachment, led to problems.
   Pobanz would say only that he regretted the situation. ``It's not
good for anybody on either side,'' he said. ``That's all I can say.''
   One pilot, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Army
``abrogated all McRae's civil rights'' after he reported the
violations, attacking his character and stability.
   ``The supervisors at the flight detachment claimed Curt was
suffering from post-Vietnam stress syndrome. If that's true, they
should have treated him and counseled him,'' the pilot said.
   Schwartz said McRae was offered the opportunity to return to his
job in a December 1988 meeting with Brailsford and was told he would
have to work under the supervisors whose violations he reported.
   ``Mr. McRae essentially said, `No,''' according to Schwartz.
   ``I'd go back in an instant,'' McRae responded. ``But I told the
general I won't keep my mouth shut and I won't do wrong again.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jacob B. Engle, an Associated Press reporter
and editor for 41 years, died last week, his wife said. He was 86.
   Engle joined the AP as a reporter in Topeka, Kan., on Jan. 3,
1927, and served there and in Wichita before transferring to
Washington in 1933.
   Before retiring in 1968, he covered 18 Republican and Democratic
national conventions.
   Engle was born in Abilene, Kan., on May 24, 1903, and was
graduated from the University of Kansas in 1925.
   Before joining the AP, he was city editor of the Pratt (Kan.)
Tribune and the Hutchinson Herald.
   After retiring, his chief hobby was gardening. In a letter
written to the AP in 1979, Engle said he grew several hundred
varieties of rhododendron and azaleas around his home in Bethesda,
Md. He was president of the American Rhododendron Society's Potomac
Valley Chapter and vice president of its Middle Atlantic chapter.
   From 1948 to 1959, he was a member of the Bethesda Fire Board.
   Engle died Thursday. He is survived by his widow, Jessie, a
daughter, Mary Louise Engle, and a sister, Viola Nigg, of Los
Angeles.
   A funeral mass was planned for 10 a.m. today at St. Bartholomew's
Catholic Church in Bethesda.

   David Lloyd Kreeger, a major benefactor of arts
and educational institutions, was toasted by violinist Isaac Stern
and praised by President Bush as representing ``the renaissance
ideal of the universal man.''
   Bush's congratulatory letter was read at a black-tie dinner
Sunday night in a downtown hotel attended by 400 guests to
commemorate Kreeger's 80th birthday, which occurred in January.
   Kreeger, a multimillionaire former insurance executive and
amateur violinist, was entertained by Stern, cellist Mstislav
Rostropovich, the Cleveland Quartet and the Tokyo quartet.
   Kreeger ended the pre-dinner musical program by performing a
Mozart duet with Stern and two Scott Joplin rags with the combined
string quartets.
   Kreeger, who is undergoing radiation therapy for cancer, is
honorary chairman of the GEICO Insurance Co., based in Washington.
For years he has been a major donor to such local institutions as
the Washington Opera, the National Symphony Orchestra, the Corcoran
Gallery of Art, Arena Stage and American University. His northwest
Washington mansion contains a valuable collection of paintings by
Picasso, Renoir, Monet, and other masters.
   Toasts were given by Rostropovich, Supreme Court Justice William
J. Brennan, and British Ambassador Sir Antony Ackland. Stern, an old
friend who often played the violin with Kreeger, told the audience
that ``David was the cultural center of Washington before it ever
became a cultural center.''

<HEAD>NJ Republican on the Defensive in Fight to Succeed Gov. Kean</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THOMAS MARTELLO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TRENTON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A six-term congressman seeking to come from
behind to prevent the governor's mansion from falling into
Democratic hands has found his campaign bogged down on issues such
as homosexual rights and abortion.
   Rep. James Courter, the Republican nominee for governor, has been
trying to close a 17-point lead pollsters said his Democratic
opponent, U.S. Rep. James Florio, held in June.
   But Courter's stands on volatile social issues have kept him on
the defensive in his quest to succeed Gov. Thomas H. Kean, a popular
Republican who is barred by law from running for a third-consecutive
term.
   Courter stormed away from a street-corner news conference last
week when reporters asked him to clarify a statement that the state
should not hire ``avowed homosexuals'' as teachers, camp counselors
or foster parents.
   At the news conference he called to discuss auto insurance,
Courter said he would not change state laws to bar homosexuals, and
bristled at suggestions he was changing his mind.
   Like Kean, Florio has said homosexuality should not be a
consideration in hiring practices.
   Abortion has hounded Courter since July, when the U.S. Supreme
Court allowed states to restrict abortion rights. The decision
focused the national debate on New Jersey and Virginia, the only
states with governor's races this year.
   Florio immediately took a strong stance favoring abortion rights.
Courter, who previously promised to sign a bill outlawing abortions,
later said he would not impose his views on New Jersey. His new
stand angered both sides.
   ``We have had problems,'' said Ken Connolly, Courter's campaign
manager. ``But we are going to show over the next seven weeks and
two days that we are not demoralized and that we are not
disorganized.''
   Both candidates in November's election are proven vote-getters.
   Florio, 52, an eight-term congressman, lost the 1981 race for
governor to Kean by less than 1,800 votes, the smallest margin in
state history. Florio has built his reputation on environmental
affairs and authored the federal Superfund laws to clean up toxic
waste dumps. New Jersey leads the nation in the number of toxic
dumps.
   Courter, 48, who vanquished a large field of candidates in the
Republican primary, gained recognition as a member of the
Iran-Contra committee and is an outspoken proponent of a strong
national defense.
   After June's primary, each campaign answered charges of influence
peddling within federal housing programs.
   Two top Courter aides, including former Reagan administration
political strategist Roger Ailes, resigned from the campaign after
their consulting firms became embroiled in a congressional influence
peddling investigation of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development.
   One of Florio's aides resigned after being implicated in an
investigation of a Camden County housing authority, located in
Florio's district.
   As the candidates head into the final stage of the race, analysts
predict the campaign will turn dirty.
   ``I think it's going to be nasty,'' said Richard Roper, director
of Princeton University's Council on New Jersey Affairs and a
consultant to Florio's campaign. ``I would be surprised if a lot of
mudslinging does not occur.''

<HEAD>World Bank Finds 1988 Good for Rich Countries, Mixed in Third World</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richer countries like the United States and
some Third World nations like South Korea and India had a good year
in 1988, but incomes in Latin America and southern Africa continued
to fall, the World Bank says.
   The bank reported Sunday that 21 countries, from Luxembourg to
the United States, increased their production by a combined 4.2
percent. Since their populations increase slowly, the average income
of each citizen went up almost as much.
   Some countries in Asia had much larger increases in output, but
populations grow faster there, holding down per capita growth.
   The World Bank is owned by 151 governments, with the United
States holding the largest block of shares.
   Bank representatives gather here this week for the annual meeting
of the bank and its sister organization, the International Monetary
Fund.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady will represent the United
States and President Bush is expected to speak.

<NOTE>Dole Plugs For Bush's Capital Gains Plan</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole says President
Bush is ``on the right course'' in pressing for a cut in taxes on
profits from the sale of stocks, real estate and other investments.
   Dole said on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' Sunday that while expanding
individual retirement account benefits would be more politically
popular, cutting the top capital gains tax rate would be of greater
benefit overall.
   The House Ways and Means Committee last week approved the
reduction.
   ``Let's create some jobs. Let's make the cost of capital
cheaper,'' which would make the country more competitive on the
world market, Dole said. He conceded, though, that ``I assume the
IRA politically is more popular.''
   The Kansas Republican said Sen. Lloyd Bentsen's proposal to
restore partial tax deductions on contributions to IRAs is ``a great
idea,'' but that the proposal would cost $12 billion or more over a
five-year period and ``where do you find the money?''
   Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee,
defended his proposal on CBS' ``Face the Nation,'' saying both his
plan and the capital gains tax cut would lose money for five years
before benefits would be seen.
   But he said his plan would help ``average folks _ far more people
would be able to take advantage of it than could a capital gains
cut.''
   His proposal would allow a deduction of at least 50 percent for
all IRA accounts and would allow the withdrawal of IRA funds without
penalty _ even prior to retirement _ for a down payment on the
purchase of a first home or to finance college costs.

<NOTE>New Weather Radar Passes First Tests</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Weather Service says the nation's
new high-tech weather radar system has passed its first test and is
headed for a detailed evaluation.
   The new radar scored a 91 on a scale of 1-100 at detecting severe
storms in five months of tests at the Air Force Operational Test and
Evaluation Center in Norman, Okla., the Weather Service announced
Sunday.
   By comparison, the nation's current weather radar system averaged
only a 58 on the same types of tests, the agency said.
   NWS director Elbert W. Friday Jr., said he was pleased with the
results in the tests of NEXRAD, or Next Generation Weather Radar.
   However, he said more performance and reliability testing must be
done before the system can be installed nationwide.
   NEXRAD will begin operational testing in the spring, with the
first system expected to become operational in July at Twin Lakes,
Okla., near Oklahoma City, according to Friday.
   By the mid-1990s the new system is expected to go into service at
165 locations across the nation. The system will be used by the
Weather Service, Federal Aviation Administration, Air Force and Navy.

   The usually predictable Emmy awards show
was quite unpredictable this year.
   The winners were picked in such a random fashion it's impossible
to know what the members of the Academy of Television Arts &amp;
Sciences had in mind.
   The hit CBS miniseries ``Lonesome Dove'' won the most awards with
seven, but the only major award went to Simon Wincer for directing.
   ABC's monumental ``War and Remembrance'' was all but ignored,
then won as outstanding miniseries. Producer-director Dan Curtis
expressed it best, calling it ``a major shock.''
   CBS's rookie series ``Murphy Brown'' was the most honored comedy.
It won four awards Sunday night, including those for Candice Bergen
as best lead actress, Colleen Dewhurst as best guest actress, and
Diane English for writing.
   But NBC's ``Cheers,'' still highly popular but looking a little
strained after eight years, won for comedy series.
   How about ``Designing Women'' or ``The Wonder Years?'' Each was
nominated for best comedy series but none of the well-deserving
actresses in either series has ever been nominated.
   Did academy members cast their votes by the ratings? If that were
the case, NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' or ABC's ``Roseanne'' would won.
Neither was nominated. ``Lonesome Dove'' was the year's
highest-rated miniseries, but it lost to ``War and Remembrance,''
which failed to get as large an audience as anticipated.
   Sir John Gielgud gave one of the best performances ever seen on
television, portraying the professor who strayed from his Jewish
faith before finding it again in a Nazi concentration camp in ``War
and Remembrance.'' He lost as best actor in a miniseries or special,
as did Robert Duvall for his multi-layered role as an aging Texas
still determined to sow his wild oats in ``Lonesome Dove.''
   James Woods won for a role as the man who founded Alcoholics
Anonymous in ABC's ``My Name Is Bill W.,'' a considerably less
complex role.
   Holly Hunter won as best actress in a miniseries or special. Her
show, NBC's ``Roe vs. Wade,'' tied for outstanding drama or comedy
special with CBS ``Day One.''
   The story of the case that made abortion the law of the land was
politically popular in Hollywood, but was pedestrian drama.
   The big loser, and the actress who should have won, was Jane
Seymour, for her magnificent role as the American Jewish woman
trapped behind enemy lines in ``War and Remembrance.''
   Dana Delany of ABC's ``China Beach'' was a good choice for best
actress in a drama series. Too bad former co-star Chloe Webb was
overlooked for her absolutely captivating role as Laurette in the
guest actress category.
   Ken Wahl would have been a good choice for best actor in a drama
series for CBS' much under-rated ``Wiseguy.''
   The funny thing about the comedy awards is the way the women from
NBC's ``The Golden Girls'' keep dominating the lead actress
category. They're great, the show's great, but the bittersweet
complaints from Dixie Carter, Annie Potts and Jean Smart of CBS'
``Designing Women'' are on the money. They deserve to be nominated
and the show deserves better treatment than it has gotten from the
academy.
   Rhea Perlman won her fourth Emmy as Carla on ``Cheers.''
Perlman's talent is looking good in a role that has been virtually
milked dry.
   More deserving were Julia Duffy of CBS' ``Newhart'' or Faith Ford
of CBS' ``Murphy Brown.''
   Peter Scolari, also of ``Newhart,'' deserved recognition for
giving new dimension this past season to a heretofore predictable
character.
   ``The Arsenio Hall Show,'' which is rewriting some of the roles
of late-night programming, lost out as best variety, music or comedy
program. Maybe they should let the young viewers vote.
   Among others not nominated:
   Kirstie Alley of ``Cheers,'' the freshest thing on the show.
   CBS' ``Newhart.'' Maybe they just make it look too easy.
   Fox's ``Married...With Children.'' Maybe they make it look too
raunchy.
   Why not NBC's deliciously funny ``Dear John,'' which won for best
guest actor? Or NBC's intriguing drama ``Midnight Caller,'' although
it did win in two guest acting categories?

   The dollar edged higher against the Japanese yen
Monday, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose
moderately.
   The dollar ended trading at 146.43 yen, up 0.58 yen from
Thursday's 145.85-yen finish. It opened at 145.90 yen and moved
between 145.45 yen and 146.45 yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average added 70.66 points, or 0.21
percent, ending trading at 34,472.54. It gained 114.94 points
Thursday.
   Traders attributed the dollar's higher opening to its upswing on
overseas markets triggered by better-than-expected U.S. trade
figures released Friday.
   The U.S. Commerce Department reported the nation's trade deficit
declined for the second consecutive month in July to $7.58 billion,
the smallest gap in nearly five years.
   The dollar held its ground despite intermittent dollar-selling
operations by the Bank of Japan, said Minori Takeuchi, trader with
Chemical Bank in Tokyo.
   The central bank intervened when the dollar was about to reach
the 146-yen level and again when it passed the 146-yen level, she
said.
   The Bank of Japan does not comment on its monetary actions.
   ``Securities investment and insurance companies were buying the
dollar at its lows, whereas the central bank was trying to halt the
dollar's upward movement whenever it began rising,'' Ms. Takeuchi
said, ``so the dollar wasn't moving that quickly.''
   But the dollar continues to be strong due to its attractiveness
to market players following the improved trade figures, Ms. Takeuchi
said.
   Meanwhile, stock trading was inactive following a three-day
weekend because of a Japanese national holiday Friday, when stock,
foreign exchange and other financial institutions were closed, said
a dealer with New Japan Securities, Co., speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Some dealers said market players were concerned about the yen's
performance against the dollar.

   Children's Hospital nurses approved an
agreement to end a 10-week strike that forced the transfer of
critically ill patients from the area's only children's trauma
center.
   ``The strike is officially over,'' Karen Cooper, spokeswoman for
the California Nurses Association, said Sunday.
   The CNA, which represents 700 nurses at the hospital, declined to
reveal the vote. The pact, reached late Friday, puts unresolved
issues such as sick leave and holiday pay under binding arbitration.
   The two sides earlier agreed to a 20 percent wage increase over
two years.
   The nurses, who went on strike July 11, will start returning to
work Friday, Cooper said.
   ``I think everybody's basic feeling is relief,'' said hospital
spokesman Steve Tiger.
   The hospital, one of 14 children's trauma centers in the nation,
transferred or discharged most of its patients, many of whom were
critically ill, after the strike began. The number of patients fell
from 170 to 38 immediately after the strike started but grew to 112
by Sunday, Tiger said.
   The strike cost the hospital about $4.5 million, Tiger said.

<HEAD>Once-Kidnapped Child-Abuse Victim Killed in Hit-and-Run Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MERCED, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Steven Stayner, whose seven-year ordeal as
a sexually abused kidnapped child was the subject of a television
miniseries, died in a hit-and-run collision near the town where he
was abducted 17 years ago.
   The California Highway Patrol said Sunday it was searching for
the employee of a Merced tomato packing company who witnesses said
was the driver of the car that hit Stayner's motorcycle Saturday.
   Stayner, 7 when he was abducted in 1972 and 14 when he escaped,
was killed as he rode his motorcycle between Merced and Atwater,
about 125 miles east of San Francisco, where he lived with his wife
and two young children. He was 24.
   ``Why him again?'' asked Sandy Hawkins, a close friend of the
Stayner family.
   Though the family declined to be interviewed, Hawkins quoted Kay
Stayner, the victim's mother, as saying she felt like her son had
been ``loaned to us.''
   Hawkins also quoted one of Stayner's sisters as saying: ``He was
missing for so long, and then came back, that if we got a telephone
call saying it was all a mistake, and he was all right, it wouldn't
be hard to believe.''
   In 1972, Stayner was grabbed off the street while walking home
from school in Merced by convicted child molester Kenneth Parnell.
As the two moved around Mendocino and Sonoma counties north of San
Francisco, Stayner was known as Dennis Parnell.
   Seven years later, Parnell snatched another boy, 5-year-old Timmy
White, and Stayner 16 days later escaped in Ukiah, taking Timmy with
him.
   In May, Stayner was the subject of a NBC miniseries, ``I Know My
Name Is Steven,'' which dramatized his life as Parnell's purported
son.
   ``My hope with the movie is that some kid sees it and gets up the
nerve to tell someone and try to come home,'' Stayner told an
interviewer in April.
   Parnell was arrested in 1980 while working as a hotel clerk in
Ukiah, 120 miles north of San Francisco, and was sentenced in 1982
to eight years in prison on two counts of kidnapping.
   Parnell, who had been convicted years earlier for sexually
abusing an 8-year-old boy he abducted, spent five years in Soledad
Prison. Now 57, Parnell is believed living somewhere in northern
California.
   While no sex charges were filed against Parnell in the Stayner
case, Stayner testified at the trial that he was regularly sexually
abused during the period they lived in motels and trailer parks and
was ordered to call Parnell ``Dad.''
   The driver who struck Stayner ditched his car two miles from the
scene, jumped into another car and fled, said highway patrol Sgt.
Bill Balestra. The driver could face felony hit-and-run charges,
Balestra said.
   Stayner, who was not wearing a helmet, did not have a motorcycle
license, said officer Allen Maxfield. His driver's license had been
suspended because of numerous traffic violations.

<TEXT>
   Hurricane Hugo pounded the U.S.
Virgin Islands and headed on a collision course with Puerto Rico
early Monday after ripping across the northeast Caribbean with 140
mph winds and leaving at least nine people dead.
   About 80 people were injured on the French island of Guadeloupe
and 4,000 were left homeless, French officials said.
   The region's most powerful storm in a decade was expected to plow
into Puerto Rico early Monday. The government mobilized the National
Guard, and residents rushed for last-minute supplies and taped and
boarded windows.
   At 3 a.m. EDT Monday, Hugo's center was located near latitude
17.6 degrees north and longitude 64.7 west, about 105 miles
east-southeast of San Juan, said the National Weather Service in
Florida.
   The storm slowed slightly from 12 mph to 9 mph, the Weather
Service said. The Virgin Islands' population is 106,000, and Puerto
Rico has 3.3 million people.
   Hurricane-force winds of nearly 100 mph ripped away roofs and
knocked out power on St. Thomas and St. Croix, about 70 miles east
of Puerto Rico, officials said. Those two islands have most of the
Virgin Islands' population.
   Officials said stores in the St. Croix town of Christiansted were
heavily damaged and there were reports of looting.
   National Guard Adjutant Gen. Robert Moorehead said 1,000 people
were evacuated to rescue shelters in St. Croix.
   Jesse Moore, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center in
Florida, said it was too early to tell if the storm ``will even hit
the United States (mainland). The closest we can forecast it is to
be off the southeastern Bahamas by Wednesday. After that it's
anybody's guess.''
   The storm caused widespread damage early Sunday as it passed near
Guadeloupe. Damage also was reported on the islands of Martinique,
Antigua and Dominica.
   Guadeloupe state radio said five people were killed on that
island. In Paris, French officials said up to five people had been
killed there. Neither report gave further details.
   Gabrielle Carabin, mayor of the village of Le Moule on the
northwestern coast of Guadeloupe, said in an interview on the
island's Radio Caraibe Internationale that two village residents
were killed. She did not elaborate.
   Beacon Radio in Anguilla said one person was killed in Montserrat
and two in Antigua, but it gave no details.
   In the central Puerto Rican town of Utuado, a man was
electrocuted when he touched a power line while removing a
television antenna from his roof to prepare for the storm, police
said. He was identified as Antonio Alago Gonzalez, 51.
   In San Juan, the Port Authority announced that it closed the
Munoz Marin International Airport to all flights at 6 p.m. It said
all international carriers had removed their planes from Puerto Rico
except for one American Airlines A300 left behind for emergencies.
   The Port Authority also said cruise ships scheduled to arrive in
San Juan had been routed to other destinations.
   A Sunday morning weather service bulletin said: ``If the eye of
Hurricane Hugo moves across Puerto Rico as forecast, we expect a
50-mile wide path of extensive to extreme damage to occur.''
   In Washington, Brian Ruberry, a spokesman for the American Red
Cross, said late Sunday that based on projections, the storm could
leave up to 250,000 people homeless on Puerto Rico.
   Civil defense officials said up to 15,000 people could be
evacuated from flood-prone areas of western Puerto Rico and hundreds
had already been moved into a sports stadium in Mayaguez, the
island's third largest city.
   National Guardsmen and volunteers drove through San Juan, the
capital, on Sunday issuing emergency instructions over loudspeakers.
   Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon flew over the island by helicopter
Sunday morning and told reporters later: ``We are as prepared as we
could be.''
   In a statement on the emergency broadcasting system, the governor
said waves 15 to 20 feet high were expected. He appealed to coastal
residents not living in sturdy homes to move to shelters in hundreds
of churches, schools and other public buildings.
   Reports indicated that the island of Guadeloupe, the most
southerly of the Leeward Islands, was the hardest hit of the string
of islands forming a 600-mile arc from the Leewards to the Greater
Antilles.
   Jocelyne Vandvurdenghe, a French government official in
Martinique, said 80 people were reported injured in Guadeloupe.
   Hugo slammed into Guadeloupe, which has a population of 337,000,
shortly after midnight, downing power lines and blacking out the
island's 30,700 telephones, state radio and television and and telex
service.
   Officials said many houses and buildings were damaged. The eye of
the storm passed over St. Francois, a major tourist area on the
eastern end of the island.
   The mayor of the village of St. Francois, Ernest Moutoussamy,
said on Radio Caraibe Internationale that ``There's nothing left of
St. Francois.''
   ``Aside from a few houses, almost all the rest were destroyed,''
he said, adding that several tourist hotels, notably the Meridien,
suffered serious damage.
   In Paris, a plane was sent Sunday with 60 rescue workers and
emergency supplies for Guadeloupe, and two more were standing by
waiting for Caribbean airports to reopen.
   Catholic Air announced in Paris it was sending clothes, water,
food, and blankets in coordination with the Red Cross.
   Louis Le Pensec, French minister of overseas terrotories, told a
news conference that his government will provide quick disaster
relief funds to those who lost property.
   The Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico were last hit by a hurricane
in 1956 when Hurricane Betsy caused extensive damage.
   Hugo is the fourth hurricane and the eighth named storm of the
Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.
   Forecasters said Hugo was the most powerful storm to hit the
region since Hurricane David in 1979. That storm killed an estimated
1,200 people in the Caribbean and Florida.

   The new Miss America wowed the
audience at her first news conference with a Christian rap song,
revealing religious feelings she had kept under wraps during most of
pageant week.
   Miss Missouri Debbye Turner also said Sunday she has been trying
to reach Atantic City for seven years and had competed in three Miss
Arkansas pageants before moving to Missouri to attend veterinary
school.
   Miss Turner, who turns 24 Tuesday, was crowned Miss America on
Saturday night. She became the third black woman to wear the crown.
   Miss Maryland, Virginia Cha, 25, of Frederick, was runner-up in
the 68th edition of the popular pageant.
   Miss Turner was asked Sunday to share the song she had sung for
the 50 other contestants backstage before the finals.
   She hesitated, then asked reporters to keep the beat by clapping.
   ``Well, I love the Lord ... with all I know ... gonna sing his
song ... everywhere I go. Gonna sing about the love ... sing about
the faith ... sing about seeing him face to face,'' she sang,
continuing with seven more verses.
   Pageant officials clapped along, including 91-year-old Adrian
Phillips, a retired pageant director who traditionally escorts the
new Miss America to her first news conference.
   ``This new Miss America is exactly what I anticipated,'' pageant
director Leonard Horn said afterward.
   Miss Turner will put her education on hold for a year to serve as
Miss America 1990. She said she will concentrate on ``motivating the
youth of this country to excellence.''
   ``My mom taught us how to do things not because we're female or
black or Southern, but because we have what's on the inside to do
it,'' she said. ``I'd like to inspire young children to dream about
being an aeronautical engineer ... and I don't care if you grew up
in a ghetto.''
   Her travels were to begin today, with a round of television talk
shows interviews in New York.
   Miss Turner said she has been a born-again Christian since age 7.
   ``There's nothing mystical or sensational about it,'' she said.
``It's simply that I believe in God and I depend on him for
direction in my life.''
   Her father, Frederick, admitted he told his daughter to quit
trying for the Miss America crown after losing in Arkansas so many
times.
   ``I'm glad she ignored me,'' he said, beaming.
   Ms. Turner was born in Hawaii and grew up in Jonesboro, Ark.,
where her mother still lives. She competed in Arkansas pageants in
1985, 1987 and 1988, and was twice the first runner-up.
   After moving to Missouri to attend the University of
Missouri-Columbia Veterinary School, Miss Turner entered that
state's pageant and became Miss Missouri, and then the first woman
from Missouri to be crowned Miss America.
   For the record, Miss Turner said:
   _ She is ``politically moderate _ I vote my conscience.''
   _ has a ``very good friend,'' but not a boyfriend. ``Right now
I'm kind of busy with other things,'' she said, grinning.
   _ is anti-abortion. ``I would hate to see the day when we have
what I call `microwave abortions,' being able to kill life simply
because it's inconvenient to have it or because it's the wrong sex.''
   _ mastered the marimba _ her pageant talent _ after learning
percussion in sixth grade.
   _ collects ``surgery souvenirs'' from her veterinary operations,
including a small piece of her cat's backbone and puppy fetuses.
   As for being the third black to wear the title, ``I don't know if
I bring any added dimension,'' she said. ``Being black is the very
least of who I am. I had nothing to do with it, and that's not
landmark. I just came that way.''

<HEAD>Death Sentences Commuted to Life Term</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maldivian President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom
has commuted the death sentences of 12 Sri Lankans and four
Maldivians for roles in last year's abortive coup to life
imprisonment, the government said today.
   The clemency came after the condemned men appealed to Gayoom,
said the statement sent by telex to New Delhi from the Maldivian
Department of Information and Broadcasting.
   Another 56 Sri Lankans and three Maldivians were convicted in the
plot and sentenced to prison terms ranging from nine to 38 years by
the high court in Male, the Maldivians capital, in August after a
two-month of trial.
   The Nov. 3 coup attempt was crushed by Indian paratroopers who
landed in Maldives in response to a call for help from Gayoom. At
least 17 people, mostly local residents, were killed in the fighting.
   ``The country had never executed people for political crimes in
its history and that he (Gayoom) did not want this generation to be
the first to shed blood on our soil as punishment for political
crime,'' the statement said.
   The last death sentence for non-political crime was carried out
in Maldives in 1953 by a firing squad.
   The Maldivian government has said the convicted Sri Lankans were
mercenaries who belong to the People's Liberation Organization of
Tamil Eelam, one of the several guerrilla groups that has
participated in the Tamil separatist war against Sri Lanka's
Sinhalese majority.
   The failed coup was led by Abdullah Luthufi, a Sri Lankan-based
Maldivian who was among those who benefitted from the clemency.
   The Maldives are a string of coral islands about 500 miles south
of India and roughly the same distance southwest of Sri Lanka. The
country is made up of about 2,000 islands of which only 200 are
inhabited.

   Gunmen opened fire with assault
rifles as family members piled into their cars to see a movie,
killing a rival gang member and a 4-year-old boy and wounding six
other people, police said.
   Killed in Saturday night's shooting were Miguel Lorenzo Navarro,
17, and Frank Fernandez Jr., said Police Lt. Ron Weigand.
   A group of family members and friends were getting into several
vehicles to go see the movie ``Lethal Weapon 2'' when a truck filled
with gang members drove by, witnesses said.
   ``It sounded like something big and fast,'' said the boy's
father, Frank Fernandez, a self-described former gang member.
   ``Everybody was yelling `Get down! Get down! I tried to put
everybody down, but my little boy was standing up in the back and he
got shot in the chest,'' Fernandez said.
   Navarro's mother, Micki Camacho, said her son was released from
the California Youth Authority three months ago and had just gotten
a new job as a warehouse clerk and purchased his first car.
   ``I tried and tried to get him to quit the gang,'' she said.
``But he wouldn't listen. He said it was too late.''
   There were no arrests by Sunday night.
   In nearby Los Angeles, police arrested 204 people on drug and
other charges during the weekend in the latest sweep against gang
violence that has plagued Southern California.

   A parade of glitz and glamor outside this
year's Emmy extravaganza contrasted dramatically with a more serious
backstage mood set by winning shows on Nazi atrocities, abortion and
the atomic bomb.
   Those arriving Sunday afternoon for the 41st annual presentations
included glamorous stars of such TV hits as ``L.A. Law,'' ``Golden
Girls'' and ``Murder, She Wrote'' wearing what some considered to be
fashion reruns.
   ``It's too bad,'' said fashion gadfly Mr. Blackwell, who shunned
the customary tuxedo in favor of a business suit. ``If it was
nighttime you couldn't see the dresses as well. They would look
better.''
   Designs included tailored suits, shimmering sequins, miniskirts
and ethnic costumes.
   Perhaps the most unique outfit was that of costume designer Paula
Glock, who embellished her black minisuit with brass knives, forks
and spoons. She called the getup ``Dinner For Two.''
   But the head-turner of the arrival scene was Jean Kasem, wife of
Casey Kasem, who had 25 pounds of metal draped on her.
   The creation, which she said was titled ``metal mass,'' was
designed by Anthony Ferrara. It was topped with a black helmet with
rows of beads falling below her chin.
   ``At least Jean knows what being a star is all about,'' said
Blackwell, who turned thumbs down on most of the star styles.
   ``There's too much cheap glitz,'' Blackwell said. ``There's
nothing new. No one can figure out what a fashion statement is. This
is probably one of the most eclectic masses of yesterday.''
   A noticeably slimmer Susan Ruttan of ``L.A. Law'' wore a tight
brocade minidress fashioned with a net pouf around the neck. Asked
who designed her dress, she said, ``I did!''
   ``It looks like it,'' sniffed Blackwell.
   Inside Pasadena Civic Auditorium, the Emmys took a more solemn
tone as winners grappled with questioning about the serious nature
of their television productions.
   ``Roe vs. Wade,'' the much-criticized account of the historic
battle for legalized abortion, brought one of the nation's most
heated controversies backstage after capturing an Emmy for Holly
Hunter and sharing the award for top drama-comedy special.
   ``I think this is an award for the drama, not the politics,''
said Alison Cross, co-producer and writer.
   Cross, who was forced by NBC to rewrite the script 20 times,
said, ``We tried very hard to make this as good a show as possible
and not make compromises necessary for television.''
   The show told the story of Norma McCorvey, the real life ``Jane
Roe'' whose U.S. Supreme Court case established a woman's legal
right to abortion.
   In her acceptance speech, Miss Hunter thanked Ms. McCorvey for
``continuing to fight and keep women from being second-class
citizens and for refusing to give up her right for reproductive
choice.''
   ``Roe vs. Wade'' was not the only winner that was inspired by
news headlines.
   Writer Abby Mann, who won for his, ``Murderers Among Us: The
Simon Wiesenthal Story,'' about the famous Nazi hunter, criticized
the TV industry for not addressing serious subjects more frequently.
   ``The industry as a whole is terribly cowardly and ignorant
toward those subjects,'' he said, ``and I'm ashamed of it.''
   Actor Larry Drake, who won for his role of a mentally retarded
office assistant on ``L.A. Law,'' said his award meant more because
his character is ``well received'' by the mentally retarded
community.
   Producer and writer David Rintels, whose ``Day One,'' the story
of the making of the first U.S. atomic bomb, tied with ``Roe vs.
Wade'' for outstanding drama special, said it was a fight to get the
show on the air.
   ``It took 4{ years,'' he said. ``It took some courageous support
from the network (CBS). It was thrilling that we had the resources
and support to do it the way we wanted.''
   Even comedy winners seemed in a serious mood.
   Rhea Perlman, who won as best supporting actress for the fourth
time for ``Cheers,'' said ``I don't think anybody deserves it this
many times.''

   The dollar climbed against the Japanese yen today
despite the Bank of Japan's dollar-selling intervention, while the
Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index rose moderately.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues rose 70.66
points, or 0.21 percent, to 34,472.54. It had gained 114.94 points
on Thursday. The market was closed Friday for a national holiday.
   The dollar closed at 146.43 yen, up 0.58 yen from Thursday's
close of 145.85 yen. It opened at 145.90 yen and ranged between
145.45 yen and 146.45 yen. The dollar had fallen a total of 1.92 yen
in the previous three trading days.
   Traders said the dollar rose despite dollar-selling by the
central bank in efforts to check the U.S. currency's climb.
   The dollar's upswing was attributed largely to a
better-than-expected U.S. trade figure released Friday.
   The U.S. Commerce Department reported that the nation's trade
deficit narrowed for the second consecutive month in July, to $7.58
billion, the smallest gap in almost five years.
   ``Institutional investors, who had strong demand, increasingly
bought the dollar in the afternoon and pushed it further up against
the yen,'' said a trader with the Bank of Tokyo, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   ``Currently, the level around 146.50 yen seems to be an
equilibrium point for the dollar's selling and buying,'' he said.
   Spot trading volume totaled $9.737 billion, down from $9.861
billion on Thursday.
   On the stock exchange, the index rose steadily, despite
uncertainties over the foreign exchange rate, as participants bought
real estate, railway and construction issues in thin trading,
dealers said.
   The market's main barometer rose mainly in the afternoon
following speculative investors' arbitrage deals, a tactic to make
profits out of price gaps between spot and futures issues, said a
dealer with a major Tokyo securities firm, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   First section volume was estimated at 450 million shares, down
from Thursday's 550 million.

<HEAD>India, Sri Lanka Sign Withdrawal Agreement</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES thruout with Indian soldiers killing 40 Tamil rebels
in campaign that began last week, background on Jayewardene. No pickup.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   India and Sri Lanka today signed an
agreement under which Indian peacekeeping troops will leave this
violence-wracked island by the end of the year and begin observing a
unilateral cease-fire this week.
   The pact ends a three-month diplomatic deadlock that at one point
had threatened to escalate into an armed confrontation between the
two countries.
   New Delhi sent about 47,000 troops to Sri Lanka in July 1987 to
supervise a peace accord that offered separatist rebels from the
ethnic Tamil minority limited autonomy if they would lay down their
weapons.
   The Tamils were urged to end their fight for an independent
homeland in the north and east provinces and offered limited
autonomy.
   But the largest Tamil group, Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam,
rejected the accord and began attacking the Indian troops, at least
1,000 of whom have since been killed.
   The presence of Indian soldiers and the government peace offer to
the Tamils also triggered a bloody backlash by militants of the
island's ethnic Sinhalese majority.
   They argued that Sinhalese-dominated government had offered too
many concessions to the minority Tamils and had compromised the
nation's sovereignty by inviting Indian soldiers to Sri Lankan soil.
   In an effort to curb ethnic violence that has claimed more than
16,000 lives in the past six years, Sri Lankan President Ranasinghe
Premadasa demanded that the Indian troops leave the island by July
29. The date was the second anniversary of the signing of the peace
accord signed by Premadasa's predecessor, Junius R. Jayewardene.
   But Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi refused, saying a hasty
withdrawal could lead to even greater bloodshed. That triggered a
diplomatic deadlock that at one point threatened to snowball into
war.
   A military showdown, however, was averted when India agreed to
make a token withdrawal on July 29 and limited pullouts
subsequently. At least 3,000 troops have returned home.
   The two countries worked out a timetable for the withdrawal of
the remaining 42,000 soldiers earlier this month at the meeting of
non-aligned nations in Yugoslavia.
   A government communique on the agreement said: ``India has
assured that all effort will made made to complete by Dec. 31, 1989
...''
   It said Indian soldiers will suspend military operations against
the Tamil rebels, beginning at 6 a.m. Wednesday. It said Tamil
rebels had earlier ``expressed a willingness to a cessation of
hostilities on a reciprocal basis.''
   The agreement also said the Sri Lankan army commander and the
commanding officer of the Indian troops would monitor possible
cease-fire violations and report them to Premadasa.
   Meanwhile, in the northeast, Indian soldiers were involved in a
major search-and-destroy operation in which 40 Tamil rebels were
killed and 28 wounded, according to a statement by the Indian High
Commission, or embassy.
   At least five Indian soldiers were killed and 16 wounded in the
operation that began Tuesday, the statement said.
   The Tamil secession began in 1983 with complaints of
discrimination in jobs and education by the Sinhalese-dominated
government.
   Sinhalese, most of whom are Buddhists, make up 75 percent of the
population and control the government and the military. Tamils are
predominantly Buddhists.
   India became involved in the ethnic problems of its southeastern
neighbor because of the sympathies of its own 60 million Tamils to
the rebel cause.

   A horse-drawn cart draped in black
transported the partial remains of four Union soldiers to their
final resting place in a funeral marking the Battle of Antietam's
127th anniversary.
   About 85 men dressed in Civil War uniforms gave full military
honors Sunday to the four fallen members of the Irish Brigade from
New York whose bones were found in March 1988 by relic hunters in a
field near the battleground.
   ``Re-enactors normally re-enact history, but today we are making
history,'' said 38-year-old Collin MacDonald, who served as
commander for the reburial.
   He said it was the western Maryland park's first Civil War burial
this century.
   An estimated 450 people watched the funeral that began shortly
before noon at the 11-acre Antietam National Cemetery near
Sharpsburg where the remains of nearly 4,700 soldiers are buried.
   ``I've done re-enactments, but to see it for real just sent
shivers up and down my spine,'' said Blake Magner, 39, of Westmont,
N.J.
   More than 23,000 Union and Confederate soldiers were killed,
wounded or missing after the battle, which ended Confederate Gen.
Robert E. Lee's two attempts to push the war northward. The battle
is described as the single bloodiest day of the war.
   The remains of the four soldiers were sealed in a canister inside
a plain, pine coffin that was lowered into the ground near the
graves of other Irish Brigade soldiers.
   They were with regiments that charged the Confederate line Sept.
17, 1862, and were killed by rifle fire. Researchers speculated that
the men's skulls and leg and arm bones were removed from the
battleground in 1865 or 1866 under a federal program to re-inter
Union dead at the cemetery. The rest of their bodies remained
untouched until March 1988 when they were found by a group using
metal detectors.
   ``We brought the remains home, but it bothered us that we had
human remains,'' said Dave Bebenroth, an elementary school teacher
from Strongsville, Ohio, who was with the group that discovered the
remains.
   About a month after the discovery, they decided to turn the
remains over to the National Park Service, which manages Antietam
National Battlefield.
   Douglas Owsley, a forensic anthropologist at the Smithsonian
Institution's Museum of Natural History, determined that two of the
soldiers were in their 20s, one was in his 30s and the other was
about 45 years old.
   Earlier in the day, the re-enactors representing the 28th
Massachusetts and the 93rd Pennsylvania regiments gathered for a
Roman Catholic Mass at ``Bloody Lane,'' a sunken road in the middle
of the battlefield where intense fighting occurred for nearly four
hours that day.
   After the Mass, the soldiers marched a mile from Bloody Lane to
the cemetery where two buglers played ``Taps.'' The remains were
buried with a clump of turf and a rock from Ireland.

   Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping has selected the
Communist party general secretary as his successor, The New York
Times reported today.
   Deng named Jiang Zemin as his political heir less than two weeks
after China's bloody suppression of a student-led democracy
movement, the newspaper said.
   Deng, 85, reportedly called on eight other senior officials to
avoid infighting and to rally around the 63-year-old Jiang.
   ``We must consciously defend the core, which now is none other
than comrade Jiang Zemin, everyone's comrade,'' Deng said, according
to a transcript of the June 16 discussion. An official with no
particular ties to Jiang gave the report to the Times, which said
two other Chinese familiar with the talks confirmed the remarks.
   Deng made it clear that Jiang would have final say over Chinese
policy, the transcript said.
   ``Every matter needs careful deliberation of various views, and
if after those views have been weighed, there is still no decision,
turn to him,'' Deng said.
   A cosmopolitan technocrat who is fluent in Russian and English,
Jiang is considered more of a mainstream leader than hardline Prime
Minister Li Peng.
   Jiang, former party chief of Shanghai, is a relative newcomer to
national politics. Though he is identified with a recent crackdown
on intellectuals there, Jiang is considered to be clearly identified
with the policy of economic openness to the West.
   Deng specified that he chose Jiang largely because of his
commitment to that policy and to economic restructuring, the Times
said.
   Jiang played a key role in the attempt to modernize Shanghai's
industry and to invite Western business leaders to invest. One of
Jiang's sons studies at Drexel University in Philadelphia.

recognition of daring, sometimes opinionated programming.
   The mainstream Western miniseries ``Lonesome Dove'' was largely

   ``War and Remembrance,'' television's graphic portrayal of the
Holocaust, captured the Emmy for best miniseries, a final triumph

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is
exaggerating his political problems _ warning of economic trouble
and a possible coup against himself _ in a bid to consolidate his
power, some U.S. analysts say.
   ``There has been a deliberate creating of a sense of crisis so
that he can undercut the conservatives,'' said Jerry Hough, a
scholar of Soviet affairs at Duke University.
   U.S. government analysts divide into two main camps on
Gorbachev's troubles, which stem from severe shortages of consumer
and other goods and nationalist movements that have gained steam
with the relaxation of political controls.
   Conservatives at the Pentagon, the Central Intelligence Agency
and some universities are warning the Bush administration that
Gorbachev could fall victim to a conservative reaction, jeopardizing
proposed agreements on arms control and human rights.
   However, the State Department and some analysts at CIA take a
more moderate view, placing little credence in warnings of a
conservative coup or predictions of a popular uprising against
Gorbachev, such as that forecast by Soviet political maverick Boris
N. Yeltsin in New York and Baltimore last week.

   Virginia Lt. Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, trying to
become the nation's first black elected governor, says his bid for
office should be viewed as an ``arithmetic progression'' rather than
a referendum on his race.
   Sitting in his campaign headquarters in suburban McLean, Va.,
Wilder insisted that his election would send a message ``more
important'' than trumpeting the success of a black man from
Richmond, capital of the old Confederacy.
   At the same time, it was clear during a recent interview that
Wilder is aware of the historical significance of his spot at the
head of the Democratic ticket in a state capital where blacks were
for so long barred from the political and social corridors of power.
   He talked of how a close friend, State Sen. Madison Marye, a
white man with a rich Southern drawl, quipped that ``my grandfather
was a Confederate army captain ... and your granddaddy was a slave.''

   Six months after taking command of the Energy
Department and vowing to steer its nuclear weapons program out of
troubled seas, retired Adm. James D. Watkins is spending as much
time bailing water as setting the new course.
   The latest crisis was a threat last week that the Rocky Flats
weapons plant near Denver would be shut down because of acknowledged
illegal storage of waste from plutonium processing. The plant is a
critical link in the nuclear arms production chain.
   Rockwell International Corp., which operates the plant under a
government contract, decided over the weekend to delay a decision on
closing the plant so officials can work on a plan to bring the
plant's waste storage into compliance.
   Also last week, Watkins faced a court order _ eventually
withdrawn _ to appear before a federal judge in Ohio to help resolve
a dispute over a $78 million settlement of a lawsuit by neighbors of
a weapons plant near Cincinnati that Watkins acknowledges is
violating environmental regulations.

   The discovery of a steer that may be a bum
has 4-H officials pondering how to reclaim their wholesome contests
from the lure of the cash cow.
   Big money has been changing hands in recent years at state fairs
around the country, with major corporations sometimes participating
in the auctions for prize animals. Large crowds and television crews
spur the bidding.
   And with the big money comes temptation, officials say.
   Authorities last month impounded Hank, a 1,245-pound steer sold
for $28,000 at the Ohio State Fair, when it was disclosed that it
may be the same animal that won second place at a county fair in
Illinois in July _ under a different name.

   With direct U.S. funding no longer a possibility,
Nicaraguan presidential candidate Violeta Barrios de Chamorro is
lobbying Miami's exile community to raise money for her campaign.
   Mrs. Chamorro, nominated this month to lead the 14-party
anti-government slate, spoke to 2,000 exiles Sunday during her first
visit to this country since becoming a candidate.
   She said the support of Nicaraguans abroad was vital to her
effort to oust the leftist government in the Feb. 25 elections.
   ``You keep alive the dream of a free Nicaragua,'' she said.
   Tonight, a $100-a-plate fund-raising dinner in Miami is planned
for Mrs. Chamorro, head of the La Prensa newspaper and wife of
publisher Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, whose 1978 slaying helped spark
the insurrection that put the Sandinistas in power in July 1979.
   The Bush administration on Friday bowed to congressional pressure
and abandoned a plan to funnel about $2 million in government funds
to her campaign through the U.S.-financed National Endowment for
Democracy.
   But administration officials say they will encourage private and
foreign groups to donate money to Mrs. Chamorro.
   She assailed the Sandinista government for human rights
violations and causing the country's economic problems, and appealed
for Nicaraguans abroad to consider returning to home if her party is
successful.
   ``The hour has sounded for liberty in Nicaragua,'' she said.
``But the liberty is for Nicaraguans and the reconciliation of all
the people.''
   Mrs. Chamorro is the candidate of the National Opposition Union,
known by its Spanish initials UNO. The Sandinistas are expected to
nominate President Daniel Ortega for re-election.
   Mrs. Chamorro, 59, a devout Roman Catholic, pledged religious
freedom and emphasis on a free-market economy in Nicaragua, which
because of war, a U.S. embargo and economic mismanagement during the
last 10 years has become one of the hemisphere's poorest countries.
   She called on the United States to grant work permits to
Nicaraguan refugees.
   Earlier this year, more than 100,000 impoverished Nicaraguans
arrived in Miami.
   A small band of opponents demonstrated outside the amphitheater
where Mrs. Chamorro spoke. Detractors among the anti-Sandinista
forces cite her political inexperience and the brief term she served
in the revolutionary government.
   In campaign appearances, Mrs. Chamorro often evokes the name of
her late husband, who inherited control of the family-run La Prensa
in 1948 and used the newspaper as a forum for attacks on the ruling
Somoza family.
   Mrs. Chamorro joined a five-member junta following Anastasio
Somoza's downfall, but resigned within a year and returned to direct
La Prensa, which repeatedly has been closed by the Sandinistas.

<HEAD>PTL Judge's Reputation as `Maximum Bob' Unfair, Lawyers Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some call him ``Maximum Bob,'' but Judge
Robert Potter isn't always as harsh as his early handling of the PTL
trial might indicate, according to lawyers who have watched him for
years.
   Potter is presiding at the federal fraud trial of PTL founder Jim
Bakker, who is accused of diverting more than $3.7 million in
ministry money to fund his lavish lifestyle.
   The trial, which opened three weeks ago, was to resume today.
   On the trial's first day, Potter repeatedly scolded defense
attorney George T. Davis. On Sept. 6, he ruled that Bakker was
competent to stand trial, despite a panic attack in which Bakker
said he thought he was under attack by wild animals. Two days later,
Potter sentenced former Bakker aide David Taggart to the harshest
prison term allowed by law.
   But lawyers who have watched Potter during his eight years on the
bench say he's not a cruel man, despite the moniker that refers to
Potter's sentencing practices.
   ``He can be harsh when it's called for,'' said Charlotte lawyer
George Laughrun, ``but compassionate when it's justified.''
   If a defendant is guilty and admits it, Potter is likely to weigh
that on the defendant's behalf during sentencing, he said. If he
thinks a defendant is lying, he's likely to weigh it against him.
   Before he sentenced Taggart and his brother for tax evasion,
Potter said he thought they lied on the witness stand. He sentenced
David Taggart to 18 years and five months in prison, and James
Taggart to 17 years, nine months.
   But Potter sentenced former PTL executive Richard Dortch to eight
years, out of a possible 10, after Dortch pleaded guilty,
apologized, and agreed to testify for the government.
   Potter's average prison sentence of 7.4 years in 1986 was 1{
times the national average, The Charlotte Observer reported Sunday.
   He has been particularly harsh on white-collar criminals and drug
offenders _ his average drug sentence of 10.6 years was twice the
national average in 1986, according to the newspaper.
   ``There's no question he deals sternly with those crimes that he
believes have a harder impact on the community, and that's always
been his trait,'' said Ken Andresen, a former federal prosecutor now
in private practice in Charlotte. ``But across the board, to call
him `Maximum Bob,' I don't agree with that. In other cases, he has
dealt leniently.''
   In 1985, Potter gave a break to a former state trooper who robbed
a Federal Armored Express truck of more than $250,000. The man, an
alcoholic with financial troubles, had no prior convictions and a
good law enforcement record. Potter gave him a suspended sentence
and a $1,000 fine.
   As an attorney, Potter worked in the 1970s and early 1980s in the
campaigns of Sen. Jesse Helms and Ronald Reagan. In 1981 Reagan, at
Helms' urging, appointed him to the bench.
   ``I've appeared in front of him for civil jury trials, and I've
come away feeling that Judge Potter was evenhanded and fair, and he
kept the trial moving right along,'' said civil rights attorney John
Gresham.

   The upstart Fox network moved another
rung up the television ladder, winning a top Emmy for ``The Tracey
Ullman Show'' at the 41st annual awards ceremony.
   The program, which won four awards, was the first Fox
Broadcasting Co. show to win television's top prize.
   ``It's a beginning,'' Barry Diller, chairman of Fox Inc. said
backstage during Sunday night's ceremonies. ``The first is always
the best.''
   The network, which has been criticized for its raunchy situation
comedy ``Married... With Children'' and the tabloid news show ``A
Current Affair,'' has defied critics who were convinced the
2{-year-old endeavor would flop.
   ``The award tonight had a special explosion to it,'' Diller said.
``I think it's because everybody involved in this enterprise thinks
of it as an adventure. And it is.
   ``There was not a single person in the entertainment business who
thought that we were anything but a fool's errand, and that we would
dismally fail.
   ``The people who were our friends thought we'd survive the
failure and go on. The people who were our enemies were juicy about
how viciously we'd fail. They're going through the process now of
saying, `Well, I guess it didn't happen.'''
   Although ``The Tracey Ullman Show'' is not Fox's highest rated
series, it is probably its most acclaimed. The variety show, which
made its debut in April 1987, is an unusual, irreverent cornucopia
with Miss Ullman as host.

   The U.S. Census Bureau plans to hire the
homeless to count the homeless during next year's census, according
to a regional official.
   Ben Arzu, coordinator of the census-awareness program for the
regional census center, said officials hoped that by hiring the
homeless they'll get a more accurate count.
   ``The details of the training are not worked out yet,'' Arzu
said. ``But we would like to hire people living in shelters to do
the actual enumeration. They probably have more experience in
finding the homeless than others would.''
   Arzu said about 60 homeless people would be hired throughout the
metropolitan area for the task.
   The special census will be conducted the night of March 20 at
shelters, on the streets and in abandoned buildings.
   He said the census-takers would not actually enter abandoned
buildings.
   ``The enumeration will be done outside buildings, as people come
out'' in the morning, he said.

<TEXT>
   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin,
associated in Egyptian minds with harsh military action against Arab
protesters, flew in today to discuss an Egyptian proposals to end
the Palestinian uprising.
   His one-day mission sent into high gear efforts by Israel and
Egypt, which made their own peace more than 10 years ago, to arrange
for elections in the West Bank and Gaza Strip of Palestinians who
would talk peace with Israel.
   Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid greeted Rabin at Cairo
International Airport and drove with him directly to a meeting with
President Hosni Mubarak.
   Egyptian officials said Mubarak hoped to get positive answers
from Rabin to questions that the president sent to Israel seeking
clarifications and assurances on an Israeli peace plan.
   Rabin, 67, a former prime minister and wartime general, sought to
reconcile Israeli and Egyptian plans for holding elections in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza, where about 1.7 million
Palestinians live.
   The Palestinian uprising began in the territories in December
1987 and Rabin has ordered progressively stricter measures in trying
to suppress it.
   The Israeli government approved a peace initiative in May that
calls for Palestinian elections leading to negotiations between
Israel and representatives of the West Bank and Gaza Strip on
limited autonomy in the occupied territories.
   The PLO has dismissed the Israeli proposal, insisting that any
balloting lead eventually to Palestinian sovereignty in the
territories, which Israel seized in the 1967 Middle East War.
   After Palestinians rejected the plan, Mubarak offered his
modified version, basing the negotiations on the U.S.-backed formula
of trading land for peace.
   PLO officials at the organization's headquarters in Tunis said
their executive committee failed to decide on the Egyptian plan in
three days of meetings last week. It sent the proposals to the PLO
Central Council, a larger body, for consideration in mid-October.
   Efforts were under way to persuade PLO Chief Yasser Arafat to
accept the Egyptian plan as a compromise. Bethlehem Mayor Elias
Freij returned Sunday from a trip to Tunis, where he met with Arafat
and said, ``the Egyptian plan is under strong consideration by the
PLO.''
   Although approved by the Israeli Cabinet, Rabin's trip
immediately triggered controversy between the two rival parties in
government, who are divided over Mubarak's plan.
   Internal differences also surfaced within the right-wing Likud
bloc headed by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
   ``If the Labor Party continues to stick to the Mubarak initiative
it will lead to a break in the government,'' army radio quoted Prime
Minister and Likud leader Yitzhak Shamir as saying.
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens of Likud on Sunday welcomed
Mubarak's efforts, saying on Israel Television, ``we regard
President Mubarak's efforts to achieve peace in the Middle East as
positive.''
   Likud's main objections to Mubarak's plan are demands that Israel
accept the principle of trading territory for peace and agree to let
140,000 Palestinians in Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem vote when
elections are held in the occupied territories.
   Leaders of the left-leaning Labor Party, meanwhile, say they
support both principles and consider Mubarak's plan to be an opener
for peace talks.
   ``For the first time an opportunity has arisen to obtain a
Palestinian side to negotiations,'' Labor leader and Vice Premier
Shimon Peres said Sunday on Israel radio.
   Mubarak was also reportedly trying to compose a Palestinian
delegation, acceptable to both the Palestine Liberation Organization
and Israel, would launch preliminary talks before the elections. The
Egyptians have suggested the list include two Palestinians recently
deported by Israel.
   Likud officials have argued that allowing deportees as
negotiators would be tantamount to speaking to the PLO, which Israel
boycotts.

<HEAD>Western Ukrainians Mark 50 Years Of Soviet Domination</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Waving the blue-and-yellow flags of their once
independent homeland and burning thousands of candles, Ukrainians in
the city of Lvov marked 50 years since Stalin annexed their homeland
from Poland.
   Tens of thousands of Ukrainian Catholics demanding legal status
for their church walked three miles Sunday through the city's
medieval center to hold a Mass outside St. Yuri's cathedral.
   Once the seat of Lvov's Catholic bishop, it is now the cathedral
of the local Russian Orthodox prelate.
   Western witnesses said up to 100,000 people participated.
   ``This is a moral victory,'' Ukrainian Catholic activist Ivan Gel
told the worshipers in Lvov, which is 50 miles east of Poland and
700 miles southwest of Moscow. ``Look how powerful our church is.''
   ``The time has come for freedom for our church,'' declared Gel,
head of the Committee in Defense of the Ukrainian Catholic Church.
   The Ukrainians carried at least 300 flags of their homeland along
with crosses, images of the Virgin Mary and banners reading
``freedom for our church.''
   The outdoor service under an overcast sky was only the latest
sign of reviving nationalist consciousness in the Soviet Union's
second most populous republic, where a new grassroots pro-democracy
group called Rukh held its founding congress last week.
   ``Tonight let us all turn off the electricity and put a candle in
the window to commemorate the millions who died under Stalinist
repression,'' said Gel. ``Those candles will also symbolize the
great hopes we have for our one, our dear Ukraine.''
   At dusk, about 30,000 Ukrainians carrying candles ringed a
central square at Lvov's opera theater and observed a half-hour of
silence to commemorate victims of the 1939 Soviet takeover and the
purges that followed.
   Candles of mourning also twinkled in some apartment windows of
the city of 650,000 people.
   The action was designed to mirror Aug. 23 demonstrations in the
three Baltic republics in which more than 1 million Estonians,
Lithuanians and Latvians joined hands to protest the annexation of
their lands.
   The Baltics and the Western Ukraine both fell into the Soviet
orbit as a result of a secret pact between Josef Stalin and Adolf
Hitler.
   The Ukrainian Church, sometimes called the Uniate Church, has up
to 5 million members by some Western estimates, and is said to be
the largest banned religious organization in the world.
   In 1946, it was accused of widespread collaboration with the
Nazis and forced to merge with the Lvov synod of the Russian
Orthodox Church. The Ukrainian church's property was confiscated and
believers who refused to accept ``the reunion'' were brutally
repressed or driven underground.
   Despite greater official tolerance of religion since President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev became Soviet leader in March 1985, the
Ukrainian church is still officially banned. The church's status has
been a major obstacle to improved relations between the Vatican and
the Kremlin.
   The Ukrainians' status under Gorbachev's reforms is likely to be
a central issue at talks reportedly to be held between Pope John
Paul II and the Soviet leader when they meet for the first time
during a November trip by Gorbachev to Italy.
   Soviet control of the western Ukraine began Sept. 17, 1939,
slightly more than two weeks after Hitler started World War II by
attacking Poland and less than a month after he and Stalin reached a
non-aggression agreement with a secret protocol dividing Eastern
Europe into spheres of influence.

   Two paramedics who were among the first to
arrive after a gunman opened fire inside a printing plant were
pinned down with four victims in a reception area while the gunman
roamed the building.
   At a news conference Saturday, paramedic Greg Torpey described
watching helplessly as Sharon Needy died of massive internal
bleeding, while gunman Joseph T. Wesbecker roamed somewhere nearby
in the Standard Gravure Corp. building.
   ``If we could have got her out right away and got her to a trauma
center ... there is a possibility that she could be living now,'' he
said.
   Wesbecker, a Standard Gravure employee on longterm leave because
of mental problems, went from floor to floor shooting people at the
plant Thursday, leaving seven dead and 13 wounded before committing
suicide.
   Torpey and Connie Grace, who were among the first to arrive at
the building after the shooting spree began, described the harrowing
scene along with three other emergency workers at an impromptu news
conference at Louisville Emergency Medical Services' headquarters.
   Torpey said that one of the wounded women he was treating had
expressed something akin to sympathy for Wesbecker when she learned,
by police radio, that he had shot himself.
   ``The victim said, `Well, God rest his soul,''' he said, ``which
for me was a tremendous boost in faith that somebody could say that
after being shot several times ... to still understand that this
wasn't the action really of a criminal, this was the action of a
sick individual, someone who for some reason has gone over the
edge.''
   Torpey and Ms. Grace heard shots as they rode up the elevator
after entering the building.
   As soon as the elevator doors opened at the third floor, they
began attending two gravely injured women, Angela Bowman and Needy.
Two other injured women lay down a nearby hallway, but police
indicated that it was too dangerous for EMS personnel to go to them.
   ``We'd been there just a couple of minutes and they came back on
the radio and said ... that the assailant was back on our floor,''
Ms. Grace said. ``I was petrified.''
   The two waited for what seemed like an eternity for another
ambulance crew to help them evacuate the wounded, Torpey said.
   Normally, paramedics try to stabilize gunshot victims and whisk
them away to a hospital immediately _ ``load and go,'' said
paramedic Kenneth Murray, who also was involved in treating victims
of the shooting.
   Murray, whose voice quavered occasionally, said he wanted to
speak publicly about the experience because ``people should know
what an AK-47 can do.''
   Wesbecker used the Soviet-designed AK-47 assault rifle, two
semiautomatic machine pistols and other weapons during his rampage.
   ``It's tough. We're talking about combat medicine,'' EMS director
Richard Bartlett said.

   The dollar was lower in early European trading
today in the aftermath of Friday's volatile session. Gold prices
were stronger.
   Foreign currency dealers said Friday's price swings and tumbles
had broken the enthusiasm for the dollar which followed much
better-than-expected U.S. trade figures for July.
   Several traders said they expect the dollar to regain some key
ground later this week.
   ``I believe we will go higher again,'' said Jens-Uwe Fischer, a
trader at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. in Frankfurt.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.58 yen to close at 146.43 yen despite the Bank of
Japan's dollar-selling intervention. Later, in London, it was quoted
at 146.75 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Friday:
   _1.9734 West German marks, down from 2.0005
   _1.7033 Swiss francs, down from 1.7260
   _6.6565 French francs, down from 6.7430
   _2.2198 Dutch guilders, down from 2.2490
   _1,417.50 Italian lire, down from 1,433.50
   _1.1850 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1880
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.5558 to buy one pound, compared with $1.5390 late Friday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $360.25 a troy ounce,
compared with late Friday's $356.25. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $360.10.
   In Zurich, the bid price was also $360.10, up from $356.00 late
Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 60 cents to close at a bid
$360.90.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.07 a troy ounce,
up from Friday's $5.03.

<HEAD>Western Officials Plan Next Phase In War Against Drugs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Experts from 15 Western nations gathered in Paris
today to plan the next phase in the war against drugs _ a joint
effort to combat the laundering of money from the narcotics trade.
   ``In recent years, it is hard to find an issue that has
galvanized the world's attention as much as the drug issue has,''
said a senior U.S. Treasury Department official, who spoke on
condition he not be identified. ``It's a truly global issue.''
   French Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy, commenting to reporters
last week, said one of the major problems facing the investigators
is the absolute bank secrecy of some countries, which makes
following the trail of drug money extremely difficult.
   ``The maintenance of absolute bank secrecy seems to me to be
incompatible with the efficient fight against the laundering of drug
money,'' he said.
   Among those attending the one-day meeting were Switzerland and
Luxembourg, two countries whose stringent bank secrecy laws
frequently have frustrated law officers.
   The French are playing host to the meeting in the greatest
secrecy, refusing even to acknowledge where in Paris it is being
held and announcing in advance that there would be no news
conference nor any information about it afterward.
   Monday's gathering was to be the first of several. Its primary
goal will be to create a ``Financial Action Task Force'' to increase
international cooperation in tracking down the profits from the
narcotics trade.
   The impetus for this latest effort at cooperation came from
President Francois Mitterrand, who had it included in the final
communique of the annual summit meeting of the world's seven richest
democracies in Paris July 14-16.
   ``This is not a study group,'' Beregovoy stressed. ``This group
of experts must devise and take action decisions.''
   Surveys in the United States indicate that Americans consider
drugs and drug abuse the most important problem facing the country.
The issue is also of growing concern in Western Europe.
   The purpose of today's meeting, in the words of the Treasury
Department official, was to inventory and evaluate the current state
of international efforts against money laundering; to determine what
improvements can be made in this area; and to submit a report to the
heads of state and finance ministers of the countries involved with
the experts' analysis and recommendations.
   The report is due in April.
   ``The global financial system is one of the integral parts of the
international drug `conspiracy,' if you like,'' said the U.S.
official. ``The recognition of the need to rein in the financial and
economic side of the house means there needs to be a marriage of the
traditional law enforcement on one side and the financial and
economic on the other.''
   Participating in the meeting are the seven nations of the annual
economic summit, the United States, France, West Germany, Canada,
Britain, Japan and Italy _ plus Australia, Austria, Belgium, Spain,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Sweden, along with the
European Commission, executive body of the Common Market.

   Relatives buried the 10 men killed in a
western Kentucky mine blast while company officials tried to reduce
methane gas in the mine so they could begin an investigation into
the explosion.
   Funeral services were held Sunday for Anthony T. McElroy, 36, of
Providence, and Curtis W. Scott, 47, of Madisonville. They were the
last of the victims to be buried from Wednesday's explosion at Pyro
Mining Co.'s William Station Mine.
   Willard Stanley, head of the state Department of Mines and
Minerals, said that a blowtorch found near the site most likely
ignited the blast.
   Federal and state investigators conducting a preliminary check of
the mine found explosive levels of methane Thursday, delaying the
investigation, said Kathy Snyder of the U.S. Mine Safety and Health
Administration.
   Sunday, MSHA spokesman Frank O'Gorman said the probe was still on
hold, although the agency approved a company plan to lower the
methane levels.
   The Pyro mine had been cited for 1,508 violations and fined
$215,757 over the last seven years, according to MSHA. About $53,000
was assessed this year.

   Gary Dotson, who was cleared last month of rape
and kidnapping charges more than four years after his accuser
recanted her testimony against him, has had another scrape with the
law.
   Dotson was arrested Sunday at the home of his wife Camille, from
whom he is legally separated, and charged with criminal trespassing,
said Cook County Sheriff's Lt. Arthur Jackson.
   ``They had been attempting some sort of reconciliation, and when
they agreed to reconcile, she gave him a key to her apartment,''
Jackson said.
   ``Things fell through. She asked for the key back. He refused,''
Jackson said. ``She left town, and when she came back he was at the
apartment and refused to go.''
   Mrs. Dotson then called authorities to her apartment, where
Dotson was arrested.
   Dotson was released Sunday night after posting $100 bail. He was
scheduled to appear in court Oct. 6.
   Dotson, 32, was cleared Aug. 14 of charges brought after Cathleen
Crowell Webb accused him of rape and kidnapping in 1977. Dotson was
convicted in 1979, but Mrs. Webb came forward six years later saying
Dotson never committed the crime.
   Dotson was granted clemency and paroled by Gov. James R. Thompson
in 1985, but it wasn't until August that new genetic evidence
proving Dotson could not have committed the rape forced Circuit
Judge Thomas R. Fitzgerald to grant a new trial. The prosecution
then dropped the charges.
   Dotson has been living in an alcohol and drug treatment center.
   Criminal trespassing is a misdemeanor charge punishable by no
more than a year in prison, Jackson said.
   Dotson had been back behind bars several times for parole
violations, including fighting in a bar and failing to report to his
parole officer.

77-3 over the first 16 deals in a semifinal of the Bermuda Bowl
world contract bridge championships today.
   The pace slowed tremendously over the second 16 deals, and the
Americans led, 103-25, after 32 deals. The match consists of 160
deals over three days.

during the first 16-deal session.
   At the same time they picked up swings on 12 deals, including
four in double digits. The set concluded with Hugh Ross of Oakland,
Calif., bringing home a difficult club slam while the Australian
declarer went down in his slam.
   In the other semifinal, Brazil, winner of the round-robin, took a
45-point lead over Poland, European champion, 85-40.
   In the Venice Cup world women's championship, the defending
champions from the United States fell 10 points behind Canada on the
first 16 deals, but then rallied to take the lead, 86-58, after 32
deals.
   West Germany took a 24-point lead, 73-49, against the
Netherlands, victors in the round-robin. West Germany and the
Netherlands finished 1-2 in the European Championship in Turku,
Finland, earlier this year.

   Three men were killed when their small plane
crashed trying to make an emergency landing but a rescuer saved the
pilot's 6-year-old son by pulling him out of the burning wreckage.
   The single-engine Piper Cub smashed into a power line and skidded
under a railroad trestle Sunday near the Chattahoochee River in
eastern Alabama, said Houston County Deputy Sheriff Eddie Ingram.
   The pilot, 47-year-old Roger Kenneth Parmer, had informed flight
controllers that he was low on fuel and attempting to reach a
landing strip at Cedar Springs, Ga., Ingram said.
   Wayne Barfield said he and his wife were fishing when they saw
the crash. They and other fishermen carried buckets of water from
the river to the burning plane until truck drivers arrived with fire
extinguishers.
   The rescuers lifted the aircraft by the tail section and Robert
Bass of Camilla, Ga., crawled under the wreckage and pulled the boy
out.
   ``If it hadn't been for them there's no doubt the child would
have perished,'' Ingram said. ``It was a heroic effort.''
   Bass said he was spraying the burning plane with a fire
extinguisher when he heard a child's cry come from inside the
airplane.
   ``I didn't know if the airplane was going to explode or not,''
Bass said. ``I just knew I had to get that little boy out.
   A relative of one of the victims told Ingram the plane was en
route to Marianna, Fla.
   Killed were Parmer; Edward Prather, 55, and Kenneth S. Partridge,
54, all of LaGrange, Ga., said Houston County Coroner Robert Byrd.
   The boy, Brandon Parmer, was in guarded condition at Southeast
Alabama Medical Center, said hospital spokesman Ray Griffith.

<TEXT>
   The discovery of a steer that may be a bum
has 4-H officials pondering how to reclaim their wholesome contests
from the lure of the cash cow.
   Big money has been changing hands in recent years at state fairs
around the country, with major corporations sometimes participating
in the auctions for prize animals. Large crowds and television crews
spur the bidding.
   And with the big money comes temptation, officials say.
   Authorities last month impounded Hank, a 1,245-pound steer sold
for $28,000 at the Ohio State Fair, when it was disclosed that it
may be the same animal that won second place at a county fair in
Illinois in July _ under a different name.
   Hank's owners deny wrongdoing, and in any case officials say open
cheating may be unusual.
   They are more concerned by the impact of the profit motive on
4-H, which after all was intended to reach out to the head, heart,
hands and health of children _ not their bank accounts _ and to
teach the way of citizen-farmers.
   Increasingly, youngsters purchase the animals they exhibit,
rather than raising them from birth, said Jack Foust, general
manager of the Ohio State Fair.
   ``We have always been concerned that we're not doing enough to
develop the whole boy and girl,'' said Milton Boyce, an
administrator responsible for 4-H at the U.S. Department of
Agriculture.
   ``Too much emphasis is put on the money, and sometimes it teaches
the kids little more than how to get their names in the paper,'' he
said.
   ``The goal here is to get the thing back in focus.''
   The USDA and 4-H this year began an educational project in 12
states to teach young people the importance of honesty. The project
began in Ohio as authorities investigated the identity of Hank, the
fair's grand champion Angus-cross steer.
   Hank's credentials came into question when fair officials
received a tip from an Illinois extension agent that Hank might be
Carl, a reserve champion at the Iroquois County Fair.
   Hank's exhibitor, 17-year-old Susan Shealy of Tiro, and her
parents, have denied any wrongdoing, as has the family of
12-year-old Jeremy Simmons, who exhibited Carl.
   Simmons' stepfather, Donald Kopsell, said he sold Hank to the
Shealys last October and that Carl was destroyed after he ate some
tainted corn.
   Fair officials have said that some similarities between the two
animals have been found. Both are black and both have a similar
belly marking.
   At issue is whether the ownership of the animal was
misrepresented. Under rules of both fairs, an exhibitor must have
owned the animal since Jan. 1 of the year in which it is shown.
   If Hank is an impostor, Ms. Shealy could lose her $28,000 prize
and first-place ribbon. A decision by the Ohio Expositions
Commission, which oversees the state fair, could be announced as
early as Thursday.
   In Ohio, the grand champion steer was purchased by Burger King
for a record $69,500 in 1986. Tyson Foods paid $42,000 for the grand
champion in 1987, and Great Southern Midway paid $38,500 in 1988.
   Auctions for winning animals also take place in many other states.
   ``When these animals get to bring these high prices and all the
TV cameras are on, I guess that's where human faults come in,
figuring a way to bring a high price,'' said Foust, who thinks the
earnings on the top steers should be divided among participants in
the contests.
   The other states involved in the 4-H honesty program are
Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri,
Wisconsin, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota.

   The most powerful storm to hit China's Zhejiang
province in decades killed 72 people and left hundreds missing,
national televison said today.
   The newscast showed the aftermath of Saturday's Typhoon Vera,
with toppled houses and workers rebuilding the shoreline with stones
and sandbags. It did not give any details of the 72 dead or the
hundreds missing.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said Saturday the typhoon was the
most severe storm to hit the coastal province in 27 years and that
it killed 48 people and injured 190. Today's newscast did not give a
figure for the number injured.
   Xinhua said rains flooded the port city of Shujiang and inundated
163,000 acres of rice paddies and 32,000 acres of orange orchards in
37 counties.
   In July, torrential rains killed 122 people and caused economic
losses of $286 million. Last year, 400 people in Zhejiang lost their
lives from typhoons, heavy rains and flooding.

<HEAD>Scientists Examine Mysterious Sponge As Explorers Raise Gold</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TRIP DuBARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers found a mysterious ``lacy and
delicate'' creature near some $400 million in gold on a 19th century
shipwreck 200 miles off the South Carolina coast.
   Charles Herdendorf, an oceanographer with the Columbus-America
Discovery Group exploring the ship, said Saturday that researchers
discovered what he believes to be two new invertebrates clinging to
the SS Central America, 8,000 feet below the water's surface.
   A Columbus-America spokesman said both samples were retrieved.
But Herdendorf on Sunday said in a ship-to-shore telephone
conversation that an unmanned submersible ship was able to retrieve
only one of the unusual finds, apparently a type of animal known as
a sponge, and scientists were still trying to determine if it was
already classified.
   ``When (the subersible operator) brought it up, it was beautiful,
very lacy and delicate. The entire animal is supported by a very
clear skeleton of glass spicules,'' Herdendorf said. ``They look
like little ice skeletons.''
   Herdendorf is one of about 20 crew members of the Arctic
Discoverer trying to reclaim as much as $400 million in gold coins
and bars from the Central America.
   The Central America sank during a hurricane Sept. 12, 1857, as it
traveled from Panama to New York. It was carrying a monthly shipment
of gold from the San Francisco Mint to New York banks by way of the
Panamaian isthmus. The wreck claimed 425 lives; 153 people survived.
   Early estimates valued the treasure at $1 billion, but
Columbus-America director Barry Schatz said $400 million is more
realistic.
   The organism captured Saturday, originally thought to be a coral,
looked different when it was brought up from the original pictures
from the ocean floor, Herdendorf said.
   He expected to place it in an alcohol solution for transport to
the shore by midweek.
   The other organism, which Herdendorf still believes may be a
newly discovered sponge, remains out of reach of the submersible, he
said.
   Though Saturday was devoted solely to scientific research, Schatz
said in a ship-to-shore conversation that the submersible Nemo
raised more gold coins Sunday.
   Many of the coins are lying in the rolls they were originally
shipped in, he said.
   In addition to the mint money, Schatz said the Central America
also carried shipments of coins from private companies to banks.
   ``One of the companies was Levi and Company before it became Levi
and Strauss,'' Schatz said. ``So Levi was making money making jeans,
and he was sending it back to New York. So we are looking at some of
his money.''
   While Hurricane Hugo lashed the eastern Caribbean with winds of
up to 140 mph Sunday, Schatz said the storm was not yet a concern on
board.

   Drugs for cancer and AIDS that have proven to
be safe and effective enough for clinical investigation, but which
are not yet licensed by the Food and Drug Administration should be
covered by Medicare, a federal advisory group said today.
   The recommendation, by a subcommittee of the President's Cancer
Panel, was drawn up in response to a proposal by the Health Care
Financing Administration that would restrict Medicare coverage to
investigational drugs that have FDA approval.
   In addition, the subcommittee called for a panel of experts who
would guide the government and insurance companies on reimbursement
policies on investigational drugs.
   Investigational drugs are those which are being clinically
tested, but which have not been licensed by the FDA for general
distribution.
   The report was being delivered today by industrialist Armand
Hammer, chairman of the President's Cancer Panel, to a meeting of
the National Cancer Advisory Board.

<TEXT>
   East German refugees say Czechoslovak
and East German authorities are seizing their passports and travel
visas to stop them from reaching Hungary and emigrating to the West.
   The crackdown has forced emigres into acts of desperation. An
East German man taking part in the exodus to West Germany drowned
while swimming across the Danube River from Czechoslovakia to
Hungary, refugee workers said today.
   The man was forced to swim because he had no travel documents,
they said.
   A Czechoslovak man today managed to cross his Communist
homeland's border to West Germany on a homemade motorized hang
glider, Bavarian border police said.
   The most direct route for East Germans seeking to take advantage
of Hungary's free passage to Austria is through Czechoslovakia,
which is sandwiched between East Germany and Hungary.
   Wolfgang Wagner, head of the West German Maltese Aid Service,
said that in some cases East German refugees have been forced off
East German and Czechoslovak trains and ordered to return home.
   In West Germany, officials said today that nearly 750 East German
refugees had arrived in Bavaria during the night. That brings to
more than 16,000 the number of refugees that have arrived since
Hungary opened its border to the West one week ago.
   East German officials have said that despite the exodus they
would not restrict travel for citizens wishing to visit Hungary _
travel visas had been easy to obtain _ but ``more and more people
are telling us that their visas are being taken from them,'' Wagner
said Sunday.
   ``Some have told me that state security had come to their
apartments to take the visas,'' and a growing number are forced to
swim the Danube River or find other illegal means of coming to
Hungary, he said in an interview.
   The 22-year-old East German who drowned in the Danube was the
first casualty reported among the thousands of East Germans
traveling to Hungary.
   The Czechoslovak man, a 39-year-old doctor, took off from a
village south of Domazlice near the West German border and flew,
apparently unnoticed, over the heavily-guarded frontier to the
Bavarian town of Cham about 18 miles west, police said.
   Border police, who did not identify the escapee by name, quoted
him as saying he fled to avoid reprisals for taking part in an
illegal demonstration in Prague, the Czechoslovak capital, last
month.
   Police in Hanover, West Germany said a 23-year-old East German
climbed over a border barrier to escape to West Germany's Lower
Saxony state.
   Police said the escapee arrived with cuts and scratches on his
hands but was otherwise uninjured. No other details were provided on
that escape.
   On Sunday, a 25-year-old man from East Berlin said he and 15
others entered Hungary on foot after crowding into three cars and
crashing through several Czechoslovak border barriers at the Rajka
crossing, about 85 miles northwest of Budapest.
   He said police in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia, took away their
travel documents and at one point they were held at gunpoint until
they promised they would not head toward the Hungarian border.
   Also today, a Polish newspaper quoted West German officials in
Warsaw as saying the number of East Germans who have taken refuge in
the embassy there has swelled to about 100.
   About 40 more refugees seeking to emigrate to the West found
their way to the embassy during the weekend, the pro-Solidarity
Gazeta Wyborcza said.
   Czechoslovakia and East Germany have eschewed the political and
economic reforms sweeping the Soviet bloc that inspired Budapest's
decision to open its border. Hungary's role in allowing East German
citizens to freedom in West Germany has been condemned by the
hard-line Warsaw Pact allies.
   The Soviets have criticized West Germany but refrained from
directly condemning Hungary as Communist leaders in East Berlin have.
   In Budapest, a senior Communist foreign policy adviser spoke of
Soviet anxiety.
   ``It's a fact that there is noticeable worry on the part of the
Soviet Union,'' Gyula Thuermer was quoted as saying in the Vasarnapi
Hirek newspaper. ``They are worried that Hungarian events will
become incalculable, and they are also disturbed that there are open
disagreements among their allies.''
   Hungarian Foreign Minister Gyula Horn, meanwhile, said the Warsaw
Pact should stick to matters of defense and not dictate ideology or
foreign policy to its members.
   Hungary is seeking stronger economic ties with the West.
   Hungary's break with hard-line allies has won praise in the West,
and West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher on Sunday
proposed a West European aid program to support reforms in Eastern
Europe.
   The total number of East Germans who have used Hungary for
passage to freedom since early summer is thought to exceed 25,000.
Many fled illegally after Hungary removed some border fortifications
with Austria in May.

   Groups of mountaineers spent the
day scaling each of Colorado's more than 50 14,000-foot peaks to
raise money for troubled youths.
   ``It's nice to be at the top,'' said climber Becky Albright after
scaling the 14,100-foot Pikes Peak on Sunday. ``It sure is different
from 5,000 feet.'' She was one of 900 mountaineers who took part.
   Peak Challenge '89 was organized by the Griffith Center, a home
in Larkspur for 44 abused or neglected boys. The home ``sold''
business leaders a mountain to climb for $500 each and raised
$27,000.
   ``The challenge of the mountain and the challenges they (the boys
must overcome) _ it's very metaphorical,'' said Albright, who is a
Griffith therapist.
   The Colorado Mountain Club provided guides to each climbing
party, as well as logistical support.

   A homemade rocket hit the U.S. Embassy
but did not explode, and six bombs went off in the capital and the
cocaine trafficking center of Cali, authorities said.
   A security guard was killed in one of the Cali bombings on Sunday
and another guard was hurt in a blast in Bogota, police said.
   Newspapers on Sunday quoted the governing party's top
presidential contender as urging that no more drug traffickers be
extradited to the United States, and one paper that has crusaded
against the cocaine cartels said one of its reporters was slain by
thugs.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Peter Samson said by telephone that
shortly before 9 p.m. ``a homemade rocket propelled by a homemade
launcher'' struck a corner of the building, causing no injuries.
   Embassy officials said the rocket did not explode and only
chipped away parts of some bricks. Police were investigating.
   Also Sunday night, three bombs exploded in the northern part of
the capital, heavily damaging three banks and 30 other businesses
and shattering windows over a large area. One security guard was
injured, police said.
   Two other bombs were deactivated by police.
   In Cali, 185 miles southwest of Bogota, three bombs eploded
shortly after midnight Saturday at two banks and a shopping center,
killing a security guard, police said.
   The city of 1 million people is home base for one of Colombia's
two most powerful cocaine cartels. The other is in the northwest
city of Medellin.
   Col. Rozo Julio Navarro, chief of the national police force in
Cali, told Colombian radio the bomb at the shopping center killed
the guard. He said another bomb was found at a bank and deactivated.
   Cali, Bogota, and Medellin have been the sites of frequent
shootings and bombings since Aug. 18, when the government cracked
down on the nation's powerful drug traffickers, who in turn declared
``total war'' against the government. Forty-two people have been
killed and 116 injured in the attacks.
   The war began after the assassination of Luis Carlos Galan, a
senator who was seeking the presidential nomination of the governing
Liberal Party and had pushed for forceful action against drug
traffickers.
   Under emergency measures imposed since Aug. 18, President
Virgilio Barco has resumed extraditions to the United States of
suspected drug traffickers.
   The Liberal Party's current leading candidate, Alberto Santofimio
Botero, reportedly called for an end to the extraditions in a speech
Saturday in the town of Ibague.
   ``I do not support giving up Colombians to be tried under someone
else's roof,'' he was quoted as saying. Excerpts from the speech
were published in a dozen Colombian newspapers Sunday.
   So far, one person has been extradited to the United States since
the government anti-drug campaign began, and authorities have said
extradition proceedings are under way against two others.
   As the violence continues, newspapers have begun calling for the
government to negotiate with the drug traffickers.
   Juan Diego Jaramillo, a columnist for the country's leading
daily, El Tiempo, suggested Saturday the government should use
extradition as a bargaining chip in negotations and warned that the
war could become ``a little Vietnam.''
   In another Bogota daily, La Republica, columnist Francisco
Morales Casas wrote, ``We should not continue with this war and
should turn to dialogue.''
   Perhaps the most important Colombian favoring negotiation with
the drug traffickers is Juan Gomez Martinez, mayor of Medellin and
one of the owners of Medellin's leading daily, El Colombiano. He
favors negotiations.
   El Espectador, however, has remained firmly opposed to such
moves, despite the murder of its editor, Guillermo Cano, three years
ago.
   The Bogota newspaper reported Sunday that its reporter in
Buenaventura, Guillermo Gomez Murillo, was shot to death by three
men who barged into his house Saturday night. It said there was no
way of telling if the murder was the work of drug traffickers.
   El Espectador's editor was slain by drug traffickers in 1986, and
the newspaper was heavily damaged Sept. 2 in a car bomb attack.

   Southern governors grappled with the
problem of infant mortality, which is especially high in the South,
trying to find ways to teach working women better prenatal care.
   ``Low birth weight is still above the national average in almost
every Southern state, and I'll bet you the rate is high because
employees don't have the education,'' said Arkansas Gov. Bill
Clinton, chairman of the Southern Corporate Coalition to Improve
Maternal and Child Health.
   ``I think it's because we haven't reached this employee
population like we should,'' Clinton said Sunday.
   The Southern Governors' Association three-day annual meeting
began Sunday with a session on infant mortality rates, with Clinton
as host.
   Among the other topics on the agenda are a session on drugs, held
by Florida Gov. Bob Martinez and Maryland Gov. William Donald
Schaefer.
   Sunday's meeting focused on the roles businesses can play to
reduce infant mortality and low-birth-weight babies _ those born
weighing 5 pounds or less.
   Joe Taylor, plant manager for Sunbeam Appliance Co. in Coushatta,
La., said a mandatory in-house prenatal education program at the
plant has drastically reduced the rate of premature babies born to
employees and cut the company's health care costs.
   The program began in 1986 after statistics showed that in 1984
and 1985, 11 employees had premature babies that cost the company $2
million in medical care.
   In 1987, Taylor said, no employee had a premature babies, and in
1988, only one did.
   The prenatal program costs the company about $10,000 per year.
   ``We've saved a great deal of money,'' Taylor said.
   According to the Southern Regional Project on Infant Mortality,
the South's infant mortality rate is 12.0 per 1,000 live births,
compared with a national rate of 10.0.
   The project has not compiled figures on the rate of low birth
weight babies, but officials said the South's rate is higher than
the national average.

   A bomb exploded on a bus and killed five people in
the republic of Azerbaijan, where rival ethnic groups have carried
out violent protests, Pravda said today.
   Also today, Armenian leaders traveled to Moscow to appeal to the
Kremlin for help in breaking what they say is an economic blockade
by neighboring Azerbaijan that is strangling their economy, Armenian
sources said.
   The Communist Party daily said the blast occurred near the
central Azerbaijani town of Evlakh on Saturday. The bomb exploded
about six hours after the bus left Tbilisi, the capital of the
Georgian republic, for the Azerbaijani capital Baku.
   ``Who planted the bomb and how, it's still difficult to say,''
Azerbaijan Assistant Interior Minister Akif Rafiyev told Pravda. The
device was placed under a window seat in the bus, Pravda said.
   Among those killed was a baby, Pravda said. Twenty-seven people
were hurt, including five who are in critical condition, the report
said.
   Rafiyev said the casualty toll could have been much higher had
not the driver escaped injury and prevented the bus from crashing
into a ravine.
   Official reports so far have not said whether the blast is linked
to ethnic tension in the Caucasus Mountain region of the Soviet
south.
   Azerbaijan is engaged in a bitter dispute with neighboring
Armenia for control of the Nagorno-Karabakh region. That region,
while legally part of Azerbaijan, is predominantly Armenian. The
Armenian population demands that the region be taken from Azerbaijan
and annexed to Armenia.
   About 100 people have been killed and hundreds of thousands of
people have fled their homes in violence that has encompassed both
of the republics during the past 18 months. Moscow has imposed
direct rule on Nagorno-Karabakh in an effort to ease tensions.
   Armenian leaders say they are under virtual economic blockade
from neighboring Azerbaijan. More than 80 percent of the shipments
Armenia receives from other parts of the Soviet Union are shipped by
rail from Azerbaijan.
   Rem Ananikyan, an editor of the official Armenpress news agency
in Yerevan, the Armenian capital, said in a telephone interview
today that the republic's leadership would take blockade issue to a
full session of the Communist Party Central Committee scheduled to
begin Tuesday.
   The Central Committee meeting will be devoted to finding a way to
solve a plethora of ethnic disputes in the Soviet Union's 15
republics, which include more than 100 ethnic groups.
   Party leaders from around the country, including Armenian party
chief Suren Arutyunyan and Azerbaijan leader Abdul-Rakhman Vezirov
will attend.
   ``There's no salt. There's no sugar. There's no oil,'' Ananikyan
said when asked about supplies in Yerevan stores. ``The grapes are
staying in the field, the vegetables are not being harvested because
there's no fuel.''
   The official Soviet press has reported that even ambulances are
at a standstill because there is no fuel.
   The Armenian Supreme Soviet, or legislature, met in an emergency
session Saturday and Sunday to discuss the slowdown in supplies from
Azerbaijan.
   Armenian officials say builders in northern Armenia who are
reconstructing cities leveled by an earthquake last Dec. 7 are out
of supplies. That means many people may be without shelter as winter
approaches, they say.
   Azerbaijan's parliament reasserted its right to rule
Nagorno-Karabakh on Saturday, calling the district an integral part
of the republic and noting the Soviet Constitution classifies it as
such.

   A fierce artillery duel broke out before
dawn today after Christian leader Gen. Michel Aoun rejected the
creation of an Arab-proposed security committee that would oversee a
truce in Lebanon.
   Police said at least six people were killed and 14 wounded in the
exchange.
   A police spokesman said ``several people'' were believed to be
buried under the rubble of a seven-story apartment building
devastated by concentrated shelling in Beirut's Shiite Moslem slum
of Haret Hreik.
   By police count, at least 921 people have been killed and 2,713
wounded since the confrontation broke out March 8, pitting Aoun's
mainly Christian troops against Syrian and allied forces.
   The police spokesman, who cannot be named in line with
regulations, said the fierce barrage began at about 1 a.m.
   He said it could not be determined who provoked the duel, which
started 90 minutes after Aoun rejected participation in an
intra-Lebanese security committee to supervise implementation of
cease-fire called by Arab peacemakers.
   ``I won't accept at all a Lebanese-Lebanese committee. This is
what the Syrians wanted, to deceive the world and say the clashes
have been among Lebanese factions,'' Aoun said in a televised
interview.
   Aoun, a Maronite Catholic who commands a 20,000-strong army, was
referring to the absence of a Syrian representative on the proposed
committee. About 40,000 Syrian troops are backing Moslem militias in
Lebanon. They were deployed in Lebanon since 1976 under a
peacekeeping mandate from the Arab League.
   The peace plan was announced Saturday in Saudi Arabia, Morocco
and Algeria, whose leaders make up the three-member mediation
committee entrusted with the task of finding a settlement by
November to the 14-year-old Lebanese civil war.
   The peace plan also called for Lebanon's Parliament members to
meet outside Lebanon Sept. 30 to work out reforms to the 45-year-old
political system, which has been dominated by the Maronites.
   The shelling since March broke out over a blockade by Aoun of
illegal ports run by Syrian-backed militias south of Beirut, in an
effort to reassert government control over the ports.
   The Syrians and allied forces retaliated by shelling and
besieging the 310-square-mile Christian enclave northeast of Beirut.

<HEAD>Frank: Gobie Wasn't Only Prostitute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Barney Frank says Stephen Gobie ``wasn't the
first prostitute I had used'' even though he believed it was wrong
to patronize them.
   In an interview with Newsweek magazine, the Massachusetts
Democrat also denied claims that he acknowledged his homosexuality
because he was afraid Gobie would blackmail him.
   ``He wasn't the first prostitute I had used,'' Frank said. ``I
just couldn't live that way anymore. I was tired of looking over my
shoulder. I met Herb (Moses, Frank's companion) about that time.''
   ``I knew it was wrong for me to be hiring prostitutes from time
to time,'' Frank said. ``Gobie wasn't the only one. I knew it was
wrong, but I couldn't sit home.'' The interview is published in the
Sept. 25 issue of Newsweek, which is on newsstands today.
   The congressman said he never risked contracting AIDS: ``I wasn't
sexually active in the old days. By the time I was sexually active,
I knew better. I knew about AIDS, and I was very careful. One of the
first men I went out with is a doctor who specializes in AIDS
research.''
   Asked if Gobie could provide names of other prominent politicians
with whom he had relations, Frank said, ``I don't know if you can
trust him. And I don't know who he's going to say was in my kitchen.
... I'm vulnerable, and other people are vulnerable.''
   Frank's dealings with Gobie are being investigated by the House
ethics panel. The congressman has said that after ending his sexual
relationship with Gobie, he hired him in 1985 as a personal aide,
using his own money, not congressional staff funds, in an attempt to
help Gobie start a new life.
   But he said he fired him in 1987 after he learned that Gobie was
running a prostitution ring out of Frank's apartment.
   Frank, 49 revealed in June 1987 that he is a homosexual. The
following year, he was re-elected with 70 percent of the vote from
his predominantly Democratic southeastern Massachusetts district.
   But the revelation about his relationship to Gobie have prompted
some calls for his to quit, including one this week from the Boston
Sunday Globe, which said he should resign for ``his own good, and
for the good of his consitutents, his causes and Congress.''
   ``The issue of Frank's conduct is not homosexuality but
prostitution, which is illegal and which has always been a
destructive element in heterosexual and homosexual life,'' the
newspaper said. ``Had the issue been heterosexual prostitution,
feminist groups would not have been silent. So far, Frank has
enjoyed more than the benefit of the doubt, he has enjoyed a double
standard.''
   In the Newsweek interview, Frank said he would never resign
``because that would among other things, short-circuit the ethics
procedure. It's very important to have that go forward.''
   He has said however that he would consider not running for
re-election if the incident begins to seriously hurt the liberal
causes he believes in.

<HEAD>`No Doubt,' Mrs. Palme Says of Convicted Killer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHAN RAPP</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The widow of Prime Minister Olof Palme,
questioned directly today by the man convicted of killing her
husband, said there was no chance he was innocent.
   ``Unfortunately, there is no doubt,'' Lisbeth Palme said at an
appeals hearing.
   She identified Christer Pettersson as the only person in sight on
the downtown street corner where Palme was shot to death on the
night of Feb. 28, 1986.
   Pettersson was convicted of the killing in July, and the
appellate hearing, which began Sept. 11, has largely been a rehash
of testimony at the lower court trial.
   After Mrs. Palme had been questioned by defense attorneys for
almost two hours, Pettersson was led into the courtroom under heavy
guard and allowed to question her directly for the first time. Mrs.
Palme, appearing shaken, closed her eyes as he was led in.
   Speaking loudly, Pettersson said: ``If I am convicted of this I
can count on 10 years (imprisonment), that is 90,000 hours, before I
have my first furlough.
   ``Therefore, I ask you to look (Judge) Birgitta Blom in the eyes
for 10 seconds and say that it was I that killed your husband,''
Pettersson said.
   The Svea Court of Appeals fell silent until Blom said, ``Mrs.
Palme nodded her head.'' The policemen guarding Mrs. Palme blocked
her from spectators in the courtroom, although she was visible to
Pettersson.
   In today's session, as in the original trial, Mrs. Palme said she
could not testify to seeing a gun in Pettersson's hand.
   ``I was focusing on his face,'' she said. ``That does not exclude
his having a gun in his hand.''
   Pettersson has repeatedly denied he was close to the site of the
slaying. A lower court July 27 sentenced him to life imprisonment,
largely on the basis of Mrs. Palme's identification.
   No murder weapon has been found.
   ``Why would I kill your husband, the friend of the weak and
oppressed?'' said Pettersson, who contends he admired Palme. Mrs.
Palme did not answer.
   The appeal was scheduled to end Oct. 5. If the conviction is
reversed, Pettersson will be freed immediately. If not, Pettersson's
life sentence may be commuted after 20 years, a common practice in
Sweden's penal system.

<TEXT>
   Cardinal John J. O'Connor says he supports Jewish
efforts to get a Roman Catholic convent near the Auschwitz death
camp closed, but that many of his fellow Catholics are prejudiced
against Jews.
   The fight over the convent in Poland has put ``fuel on the
fire,'' O'Connor said on the WNBC-TV's ``News Forum'' program,
broadcast Sunday. ``I think there are many Catholics who are
anti-Semitic.
   ``It's deep within them, and this kind of thing then just throws
up the flames. And simultaneously there are Jews who live in fear of
Catholic anti-Semitism and consequently ... it feeds the fear,''
O'Connor said. He said he has received letters criticizing him for
supporting the move of the convent.
   He said he is exploring the possibility of talking to Pope John
Paul II about the dispute, which arose after the church agreed to
close the convent and then local Catholic officials in Poland balked.
   ``It's not a fight between Jews and Catholics,'' O'Connor said.
``Catholics and Jews made an agreement. The agreement hasn't been
honored. It's as basic as that.''
   The convent just outside the Auschwitz concentration camp is seen
by many Jews as an intrusion of Christian symbols at a place where
2.5 million Jews were murdered by the Nazis during World War II.
   A 1987 accord between Jewish and Roman Catholic representatives
stipulated the convent should be moved by Feb. 22, but the deadline
passed and the convent remained. The Polish primate, Cardinal Jozef
Glemp, has termed the accord ``offensive.'' An estimated 1.5 million
Christians also were killed at Auschwitz.
   Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel, an Auschwitz survivor who appeared on
the same program, said Jews are in a no-win situation in the dispute.
   If the convent of Carmelite nuns is allowed to remain, ``We
lost,'' Wiesel said. ``But even if we win, we lost.
   ``Can you imagine when the nuns will leave the convent? There
will be thousands of reporters and TV cameras, and people will say,
`Look, these poor Carmelite nuns thrown out of their convent by
Jews!' We don't need that.''
   O'Connor said he considered ``unwise'' the recent trip by Rabbi
Avraham Weiss and six other Jewish demonstrators from New York to
Auschwitz, where they were attacked when they tried to climb a fence
surrounding the grounds.
   The archbishop also called Glemp's statements after the incident
``unfortunate.'' Glemp said the Jews had launched attacks on the
convent, possibly intending to kill the sisters, and that Jews had
the media ``easily at your disposal in many countries.''

<HEAD>Amtrak Pleads Innocent in Sewage-Dumping Charge</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PALATKA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amtrak pleaded innocent today to charges
stemming from its practice of flushing passenger-car toilets and
sewage holding tanks into Florida waterways as trains go over
bridges.
   Assistant State Attorney Paul Meredith said the federal railroad
agency submitted its pleas to Circuit Judge Robert Perry by
facsimile machine.
   The plea was entered after Amtrak rejected a settlement offer
from district state Attorney John Tanner, who promised to drop three
charges of commercial dumping if Amtrak would stop all flushing
while its trains cross trestles over creeks and rivers.
   The company said it can't do that because it would set a
precedent. Federal law permits the railway to dump its sewage on its
right-of-way, and this overrides state and local regulations, Amtrak
contends.
   Amtrak has threatened to suspend service in Florida if Tanner
presses his case but Tanner said Amtrak was bluffing.
   Amtrak has come under fire in several Western states as well as
Florida for the sewage dumping.
   But the Putnam County case may be the first to go before a
criminal judge. Amtrak spokesman Clifford Black has said the only
other pending cases are two civil lawsuits in Oregon. There have
been ``concerns and inquiries'' raised in other states, he said.
   ``They run the risk of losing passenger train service,'' said
Black. ``That is something the various jurisdictions must consider.''
   Agreeing to Tanner's plea bargain would make Amtrak a target for
similar demands from anyone else wanting to stop dumping in any body
of water in Florida, Black said.
   ``With the myriad waterways in Florida, it would be an impossible
situation,'' he said.
   Amtrak's 600 passenger cars dispose of sewage either by dumping
directly onto the tracks when toilets are flushed or by spraying the
contents of 30-gallon holding tanks when the trains are traveling at
least 35 mph.
   The company hopes eventually to replace much of its fleet with
new cars that would have holding tanks for all toilets. Black said
it would cost $147 million to install those tanks on the current
fleet.

<TEXT>
   The captain of the United DC-10 that crashed in
Iowa killing 112 people called for its two remaining engines to be
shut down 15 seconds before impact, but another pilot said, ``I
can't pull 'em off or we'll lose it.''
   The National Transportation Safety Board released a transcript of
the final 33 minutes and 34 seconds of conversation in the cockpit
of Flight 232.
   The tape, which is on a loop that records over itself after about
30 minutes, covered noises beginning about 10 minutes after the
airliner's tail engine failed, shooting debris that cut off the
plane's hydraulic control system.
   Pilot Alfred C. Haynes said the only way he and three other men
in the cockpit could steer and control elevation of the plane was by
applying power selectively to the two working jet engines.
   Here are the final seconds of the conversation before the plane
crashed in Sioux City as it was attempting an emergency landing:
   Haynes: ``Ease the power back, ease the power back.''
   First Officer William R. Records: ``Maybe you can pull 'em all
the way off.''
   Haynes: ``Left turns, left turns...close the throttles.''
   Records: ``Close 'em off.''
   Haynes: ``Right turn. Close the throttles.''
   Records: ``Pull 'em (all) off.'' The transcript indicates that
the word ``all'' is questionable.
   Training pilot Dennis E. Fitch: ``Nah. I can't pull 'em off or
we'll lose it. That's what's turnin' ya.''
   Two responses of ``okay'' are given but the speaker is not
identified. Then Records says, ``Left, Al,'' speaking to the
captain, followed by ``left throttle...left, left, left, left, left,
left, left, left, left left!''
   The transcript then shows one of the crewmen saying repeatedly
either ``we're turnin''' or ``we're tryin,'' and finally a single
word one second before impact: ``God.''
   Fitch, who was on the flight as a passenger, had been brought
into the cockpit to help in the landing and was manipulating the
speed controls. The plane crash-landed short of the runway with the
surviving two engines operating. There were 184 survivors.
   The board had previously released conversations between the
pilots and ground controllers, but had not included the separate
sounds of the cockpit recorder.

<HEAD>To Thwart Drug Dealers, Ex-Treasury Secretary Proposes Currency Change</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Donald T. Regan, who served as treasury
secretary and White House chief of staff in the Reagan
administration, proposed today that the government change the color
or size of $50 and $100 bills to frustrate drug dealers with big
accumulations of currency.
   Under Regan's proposal, the government would announce that the
old bills would be worthless in 10 days.
   When people went to banks to exchange their bills for the new
currency, records would be made of all transactions involving more
than $1,000 _ forcing drug dealers to either give up vast fortunes
or expose themselves to scrutiny by law enforcement agencies.
   ``This would panic those with huge cash holdings,'' Regan said in
an article written for the op-ed page of The New York Times.
   ``If the cash is legitimate, no one should have any fear. Yes, it
might cause confusion for a couple of months, but what honest
citizen wouldn't be willing to put up with a little inconvenience so
as to trap these criminals?'' Regan wrote.
   ``This would hit the criminals where it hurts most _ in the
pocketbook.''
   Additionally, Regan proposed that the Bush administration call
for an agreement of all central banks in industrialized nations to
instruct member banks not to accept deposits ``from known, or
suspected, drug dealers and not to do business with any banks _
Latin, Caribbean, Asian or wherever, that accept drug money.''
   President Bush and William Bennett, his drug policy coordinator,
should ask the leaders of the 200 largest banks and savings
institutions in this country to pledge ``not to accept deposits from
drug dealers, whether overlords or street pushers,'' Regan also
proposed.
   The idea of changing the color of U.S. currency to thwart drug
dealers or others holding large hordes of illegally obtained cash
has been offered before but resisted by the government.
   In 1986, Katherine Ortega, then the U.S. treasurer, announced
after a study that the idea had been rejected.
   Subtle changes have been made in recent years in the design of
U.S. currency to make it more difficult to duplicate with ever more
sophisticated photocopying machines. A tiny plastic thread and
microscopic printing were added _ changes that could not be
reproduced by copying machines.

   Ford Motor Co. will recall nearly 500,000
passenger cars manufactured in 1985 and 1986 that do not meet
federal emission standards, the Environmental Protection Agency said
today.
   The affected vehicles have 1.9-liter engines and include the 1985
Ford Escort and Mercury Lynx and the 1986 Escort, Lynx and Ford EXP,
the EPA said. It said California cars are not included in the recall.
   Excessive emissions of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide were
discovered during tests of 1985 models, EPA said in a statement.
Ford subsequently agreed to recall the vehicles.
   Repairs will involve changing the choke systesm, distributor
spark advance and the air-injection system, a pollution-control
system which helps the catalytic converter control hydrocarbons and
carbon monoxide. Dealers also will install more durable crankcase
ventilation valves, the agency said.
   Ford will notify car owners of the recall and the repair work
will be performed at no charge regardless of a vehicle's age or
mileage.

<HEAD>Witness in New York Police Killings Passes Lie Detector Test, Leaves
Town</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who was relocated here after
testifying in the killing of a New York City police officer was
moved again, and even his attorney says he doesn't know where the
man is now.
   The man, a Guyanese immigrant with the single name of Arjune,
came to local attention when he recently claimed that he was roughed
up by a police officer.
   He passed a private lie detector test on that claim, then was
quickly relocated under the federal witness program that brought him
to Spokane originally, attorney Carl Maxey said Friday.
   Arjune, who took the name of Amos Hardeen under his new identity,
was moved to Spokane secretly a year ago after he became a key
witness in the prosecution of two men accused of killing New York
City police officer Edward Byrne, whose death became a factor in
last year's presidential campaign when George Bush said it showed
the need for the death penalty.
   ``All I can tell you is that he's gone,'' said Maxey. ``Even I
don't know where they took him this time.''
   Arjune's cover was effectively blown in his run-in with local
police.
   This past week, he publicly discussed his arrest on Sept. 1 by
officer Patricia Madsen, saying she called him a racial slur,
accused him of being a drug dealer and struck him in the back while
he was arrested and taken to jail.
   Madsen said she stopped Arjune's car for speeding and suspected
him of being drunk. When a blood test showed he had not been
drinking, he was booked on charges of speeding and failure to stop
at a stop sign. He also was accused of resisting arrest.
   Police Chief Terry Mangan called Arjune a liar who ``thinks he is
above the law'' and said another polygraph examination cleared the
arresting officer.
   The New York murder case in which Arjune testified gained
national attention last year when Bush was given the badge from the
father of the slain officer.
   Bush last week also used the badge in a televised address to
schoolchildren about the dangers of drugs.
   Arjune, 47, lived in a crack-ravaged neighborhood in the New York
borough of Queens. Byrne, a 22-year-old rookie police officer, was
shot Feb. 26, 1988, as he guarded Arjune's house because of prior
threats against Arjune.
   Four men were convicted of second-degree murder and weapons
charges and were sentenced to 25 years to life in the killing.
   Arjune had led a quiet life in Spokane, working as a mechanic at
a Ford dealership.
   Armed federal agents were sent to guard Arjune as a moving van
cleared out his house in the Shiloh Hills area.

<TEXT>
   House staff members met today with
congressional investigators to outline an inquiry an Ohio lawmaker
is seeking into the Navy's report on the explosion aboard the
battleship Iowa.
   Rep. Mary Rose Oakar last week asked the General Accounting
Office and the House Armed Services Committee to investigate the
thoroughness and impartiality of the Navy's probe.
   The Navy said it is standing by its investigation of the April 19
gun turret explosion that killed 47 sailors aboard the battleship.
The study concluded that sabotage by Clayton Hartwig, a gunner's
mate from Cleveland, ``most likely'' caused the blast.
   Aides to the House Banking economic stabilization subcommittee,
which Ms. Oakar chairs, met with GAO officials today to discuss
details of her request for an investigation.
   Media General News Service reported in a copyright story Sunday
that transcripts of interviews done by Navy investigators showed the
Iowa was a floating laboratory for high-explosive experiments at the
time of the blast.
   Investigators were also told improper gunpowder was being used in
experiments when the No. 2 turret exploded.
   ``Everything was very carefully considered,'' said Cmdr. Mark
Baker, a Navy spokesman at the Pentagon, who defended the Navy's
report on the explosion.
   The transcripts showed that the Navy command which requested the
experiments also performed the tests on the powder. Those tests led
to the Navy's conclusion about the cause of the explosion.
   A report the Pentagon released earlier this month said
circumstantial evidence indicated Hartwig sparked the explosion on
purpose. That conclusion could not be proved, however, because all
the witnesses died in the blast, the report added.
   Gunners were firing an experimental load from the No. 2 turret
with powder not approved for the weight of the projectile. The 7,007
pages of transcripts showed the tests were designed to improve the
accuracy and range of the ship's old 16-inch guns.
   The ship's gunners were using five 110-pound bags of the powder
instead of the normal charge of six bags of powder. The report said
the powder was clearly marked that it was not to be used with the
heavyweight projectiles being fired.
   The battleship's commander, Capt. Fred B. Moosally, told
investigators that he did not know a five-bag charge was going to be
used.
   Moosally said he approved the use of a ``reduced charge,'' but
said he thought that meant six 55-pound bags of powder.
   Investigators pursued the theory that Hartwig, who took over as
gun captain on short notice, perhaps was confused to see only five
bags of powder pop out from the powder cars instead of six, and that
somehow in the confusion the powder got rammed into the barrel too
quickly, splitting a bag open and setting off the powder by friction
with the projectile.
   The friction theory was eliminated by a series of technical tests
under the direction of the Naval Sea Systems Command at the Naval
Surface Warfare Center at Dahlgren, Va., the same command that
request and encouraged the tests aboard the Iowa.
   Sens. John Glenn and Howard Metzenbaum, both D-Ohio, last week
made a formal request to the Senate Armed Services Committe for
investigations.
   The letter from Glenn and Metzenbaum said Hartwig's reputation
``has been harmed beyond repair'' by the Navy report.

<HEAD>Italian Museum Closing to Battle Woodworms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of Italy's leading museums has called the
exterminator to halt an invasion of woodworms, officials said Monday.
   The Borghese Gallery, located in Villa Borghese Park near the
Piazza del Popolo, will be closed Sept. 26 to Oct. 10 for extensive
woodworm extermination, said Luigi Conte of the Ministry of Culture.
   The museum displays paintings and sculptures dating from Roman
times to the 19th century, including masterpieces by Botticelli and
Caravaggio.
   ``The museum's paintings on wood, the frames and the wood
structures which canvases are stretched out on are being attacked,''
said the Rome newspaper Il Tempo. It said the works under siege were
those in storage.
   Conte said the museum has been undergoing major renovation and
that this accounted for the unusually large number of works in
storage.
   He said, ``No major damage has been done to the paintings'' by
the woodworms, which bore into wood and breed there.

<TEXT>
   A woman construction worker filed a
lawsuit Monday claiming she was fired because her good looks
distracted male employees and caused them to have accidents on the
job.
   ``Is it my fault? I shouldn't get the sack because men can't keep
their minds on the job,'' said 24-year-old Tanya Graovac, who
brought the action at the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity
Commission.
   She said it was not her fault if ``somebody apparently cut his
finger.'' Her story appeared on the front page of The Australian, a
national newspaper.
   Ms. Graovac, who was dismissed in June, told the paper she didn't
mind ``wolf whistles'' and suggestive remarks from male workers but
that she was not prepared to accept being fired for being too
good-looking.
   Her employer, Solander Industries of northern Queensland, denied
the charge. ``It may seem strange, but we employ a lot of women on
our sites,'' said Construction Manager Andrew Corrigan. ``She was
part of a casual cleaning gang that was laid off because there was
no work.''

   An explosion that killed 24 people on a passenger
train near Shanghai was set by an impoverished farmer, the
government said Monday.
   The farmer, Zhou Wenzhi, was among those who died on June 26 when
dynamite exploded in a toilet at the front of a third-class
compartment of the train, the official Xinhua News Agency quoted the
Public Security Ministry as saying.
   Eleven people were seriously injured. The explosion on the
Hangzhou-Shanghai line occurred 20 miles southwest of Shanghai.
   Zhou, 25, from the suburbs of Yiwu in coastal Zhejiang province
acted because he was unable to repay $2,700 he borrowed for a
construction project, Xinhua quoted police investigators as saying.

<HEAD>American Team Searches Atoll for Earhart Remains</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SUVA, Fiji (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American team landed Monday on a deserted
Pacific island where it believes Amelia Earhart crashed in her 1937
attempt to fly around the world, the expedition leader said.
   ``There was no immediate sign of any wreckage,'' Richard
Gillespie, head of the International Group for Historic Aircraft
Research, told his base camp in Fiji from a ship off the island of
Nikumaroro, 1,000 miles to the east.
   Gillespie's Wilmington, Del.-based group will spend the next
three weeks searching Nikumaroro in the Kiribati Archipelago.
   ``Near the beach, the vegetation is very dense and easily could
have hidden an aircraft from aerial searches,'' he said of attempts
52 years ago to locate the American pilot after she crashed.
   The 16 expedition members _ including naval historians, divers
and archaeologists _ left Fiji a week ago aboard a converted
Japanese trawler, the Pacific Nomad.
   After spending the past two years trying to resolve a mystery
that has confounded experts for decades, they concluded that Miss
Earhart must have crashed landed on Nikumaroro instead of her
intended stopover destination of Howland Island, 500 miles to the
north.
   Gillespie said that if she crashed on the island at low tide she
would have stood a good chance of surviving for a brief time.
   Nikumaroro, also known as Gardner, is uninhabited and without
fresh water. The group believes Miss Earhart managed to send
distress signals for about three days before dying of thirst.
   ``We are all very exhilarated and in awe of the beauty of the
place,'' he said. ``None of us have ever seen a place so wild as
Nikumaroro.''
   He said the V-shaped island was home to a huge amount of wildlife.
   ``Seabirds of every description circle the island and
black-tipped sharks are in constant attendance. There are fish,
turtles and dolphins in abundance.''
   Miss Earhart disappeared in 1937 after taking off from Papua, New
Guinea, just north of Australia, in an attempt to make the first
circumnavigation of the world by plane. Her exploits achieved
legendary status in the United States. The flyer was 6,820 miles
short of her goal when she and navigator Fred Noonan vanished.
   The expedition to find her remains, which has cost $250,000 so
far, was spurred by research by two Fort Walton Beach, Fla. men _
Tom Willi, a former Navy pilot, and Tom Gannon, a retired Air Force
navigator.
   They studied aircraft navigation of the 1930s to plot a probable
course followed by Earhart. Their research pointed toward Nikumaroro.

<TEXT>
   A judge today fined the United Mine Workers
$13.5 million _ nearly double the amount of his previous penalties _
for a litany of violations during a strike against the Pittston Coal
Group Inc.
   The UMW now has been fined $22 million by state and federal
judges for violations of injunctions limiting strike activity during
the 5{-month-old walkout.
   In two previous hearings, Russell County Circuit Judge Donald
McGlothlin fined the union $3 million and $4.5 million. U.S.
District Judge Glen Williams has fined the union about $1 million.
   McGlothlin imposed the new fine today after hearing testimony
last week on 60 charges alleged by Pittston.
   In addition to fines for specific incidents of violent and
non-violent violations of strike restrictions he issued in July and
August, the judge imposed a general penalty of $1 million against
the union for failing to control violence.
   Elsewhere today in Russell County, in western Virginia, UMW
members and an Appalachian religious leader continued to occupy
Pittston's main coal preparation plant.
   Outside the plant, 1,200 sympathizers staged a rally in support
of the often-bitter strike, state police spokesman Charlie Vaughan
said.
   Pittston elected against taking immediate action against the 99
people in the plant.
   ``Basically, we consider it trespassing, but as of right now,
nothing's been done,'' Pittston spokeswoman Susan Copeland said
Sunday night after the group entered the Moss No. 3 Preparation
Plant, where coal is cleaned, sorted and shipped. ``Management
people are over there in the area evaluating the situation.''
   When they entered the plant Sunday, the demonstrators said they
were protesting stalled contract talks and court actions since they
went on strike against Pittston on April 5.
   The demonstrators said they had enough provisions to last several
weeks, and they issued a statement saying they wanted their actions
to remain peaceful.
   The strike began when about 1,700 miners from Virginia and West
Virginia walked off their jobs at Pittston operations, and there has
been no resumption set for talks aimed at ending the walkout. After
negotiations broke off last week, UMW officials said they would wait
for Pittston to schedule the next round of discussions.
   At one point earlier this summer, the Pittston walkout sparked
sympathy wildcat walkouts that affected tens of thousands of UMW
members at other mines.

<TEXT>
   Jay Stewart, announcer of the television game
show ``Let's Make a Deal,'' died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound
at his home in Hollywood, police said. He was 71.
   Officers were called to the home about 4 p.m. Sunday after
neighbors and relatives reported hearing a gunshot, detective
Russell Kuster said.
   Stewart, whose real name was Jay Fix, was reported dead on the
scene and officers classified the incident a suicide, Kuster said.
   ``There was a last will and testament on his person, and some
sort of a suicide note, but I can't really give that to you,''
Kuster said. He said Stewart shot himself just outside the entrance
to the detached garage of his home.
   ``Let's Make A Deal,'' the hit game show that had Monty Hall as
its host, premiered on NBC in 1963, and later moved to ABC until
1976.
   A popular feature of the show was ``Jay's Tray'' in which the
announcer brought down a studio aisle to Hall a covered item _
sometimes valuable, sometimes not. Hall bargained with a contestant
over its contents.
   The game show was later seen in syndication and more recently was
revived by the USA cable network.
   An old CBS biography said Stewart was born in Indiana. He
attended Butler University there, and his first broadcasting job was
in a radio station Terre Haute, Ind.
   He is survived by his wife, Phyllis, and two daughters.

   A 15-year-old boy was charged today with a
1987 slaying and the killings earlier this month of a Warwick woman
and her two daughters.
   Family Court Judge Carmine DiPetrillo said Craig Price was
charged with six counts: four of juvenile delinquency by reason of
first-degree murder and two of delinquency by reason of burglary.
   Price was arraigned under heavy security and was whisked away to
the state Training School, where he will be held until a
probable-cause hearing Thursday. Youths brought to the juvenile
court do not enter a plea until after the probable cause hearing.
   DiPetrillo ordered Price held ``for his protection and the
protection of the public.'' There was no doubt Price would be a
danger if released, the judge said.
   Price was arrested Sunday at a house one block away from where
Joan Heaton, 39, and her daughters, Jennifer, 10, and Melissa, 8,
were found stabbed to death in their home Sept. 4, said Police Chief
Wesley Blanchard.
   Heaton and her daughters had moved to the house four years ago,
following the 1983 suicide of her husband, neighbors said.
   DiPetrillo said Price is also accused of killing Rebecca A.
Spencer, 27, who lived several houses away from Price in 1987.
Police said earlier the murders at the two nearby homes were similar
and that they had suspected the same person committed them.
   Attorney General James E. O'Neil said the youth cannot be tried
as an adult because he is under 16, the minimum age at which a
juvenile can be tried in the adult court system.
   O'Neil said that if Price is convicted, the most severe
punishment he faces is placement in a juvenile detention center
until the age 21.
   Authorities said an intruder broke into the Heaton's home the
night of Sept. 4, but police said there was no apparent motive for
the killings.
   Warrick is a suburb just south of Providence.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Theater impresario Cameron Mackintosh has agreed to
stop giving away programs to the new Andrew Lloyd Webber musical
``Miss Saigon,'' produced by Cameron Mackintosh.
   Stoll Moss Theaters Ltd. said Monday the producer promised to
stop giving away the booklets at the Theater Royal, where the
musical is in previews.
   The play, which has already sold $7.75 million worth of tickets,
premieres Wednesday. Mackintosh decided that $1.90 for a program was
too much, so he and 10 of his employees handed out free programs
last week.
   Although programs for plays are generally given away free in the
United States, theatergoers in England pay for them.
   Mackintosh said the protest followed weeks of arguments with the
Stoll Moss Group, owners of 13 theaters in London's West End.
   Last week, Stoll Moss' managing director, Roger Filey, said the
dispute was ``only a little squabble,'' but one that needed to be
resolved.
   Mackintosh has also produced ``Cats,'' ``The Phantom of the
Opera'' and ``Les Miserables.''

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city editor of the Philadelphia Daily
News has resigned after a joke he inserted into a news release was
mistakenly printed, the newspaper announced Monday.
   Tom Opdyke had slipped the joke into an announcement of
scholarships being established in memory of the late NBC newswoman
Jessica Savitch. Miss Savitch drowned in 1983 when the car in which
she was riding plunged into the Delaware Canal in suburban New Hope.
   Opdyke had electronically inserted a phrase stating that the
scholarships in broadcast journalism would also be available to
students seeking ``college instruction in automobile-escape
techniques.''
   In an article in Monday's editions of the Daily News, editor
Zachary Stalberg quoted Opdyke as saying he never intended for the
phrase to appear in the newspaper. Opdyke said he had planned to add
a notation saying the phrase was not part of the news release, but
forgot.
   When Opdyke saw the phrase in Thursday's early edition, he had it
corrected for the later edition and pointed out the error to
Stalberg, the editor said.
   The reporter who wrote the story, based on the altered news
release, and other editors who handled it ``did not know the phrase
was anything but genuine,'' Stalberg said.
   The newspaper ran a correction and apology Friday.
   ``It was a terrible error, and an apology to the Savitch family
and to the name of Jessica Savitch seems to fall short,'' Opdyke
said in a statement.
   Stalberg called Opdyke a ``skilled and serious newspaperman,''
but said he had violated ``the one immutable standard of a
professional news organization,'' tampering with the news.
   Opdyke, 36, had been with the Daily News since 1986 and was named
city editor in mid-March.

   Author Berry Fleming, noted for his 1945
novel on political corruption in a Southern town, was buried Monday
in the east Georgia city where he was born.
   Fleming died Friday at his home in Augusta. He was 90.
   Fleming produced 20 novels, but his most famous was ``Colonel
Effingham's Raid,'' published in 1945. The novel satirized a
Southern town's struggles with a corrupt political party during the
1930s and 1940s. It eventually was made into a movie.
   Fleming was born in Augusta on March 19, 1899. After service in
World War I, he graduated from Harvard University in 1922 and worked
for publications such as The New Yorker, Life, and Punch, the
British humor magazine.
   He returned to Georgia 50 years ago, shortly after his marriage
to Anne Molloy of Lexington, Ky.
   Fleming was honored by the Georgia Senate last year in a
resolution that called him ``one of America's greatest living
authors.'' He also was a painter, and his abstract and watercolor
works were exhibited in his hometown.
   He is survived by a daughter, Shirley Moragne Fleming of Augusta.

<HEAD>Eds: LEADS with four grafs to UPDATE with Yeltsin denying accusations;

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet politician Boris Yeltsin drank heavily and
spent wildly during his high-profile tour of the United States, an
article in the Communist Party daily Pravda contended today.
   Yeltsin on Sunday wound up his nine-city U.S. tour with a visit
on Sunday to a supermarket near Houston and then a trip to Miami.
   Pravda, without comment, reprinted what it said was an article on
Yeltsin's behavior from the Italian newspaper La Repubblica.
Yeltsin, who arrived back in Moscow today, denounced the article.
   ``It's a simple lie, slander, and revenge for the fact that
Americans received us with admiration,'' he told The Associated
Press.
   In a box on the Communist Party daily's front page telling
readers what to find inside, Pravda quoted the La Repubblica article
as saying Yeltsin found the United States to be ``a holiday, a
stage, a 5,000-kilometer-long bar.''
   Soviet officials have not commented on Yeltsin's trip to the
United States, saying that his behavior and his comments were his
own affair, since he was on a private trip.
   But official papers have reprinted several comments recorded in
the foreign press that in the Soviet Union could be damaging to
Yeltsin.
   Yeltsin, the 58-year-old former Communist Party chief of Moscow,
was stripped of that job by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev almost
two years ago.
   He has become an anti-establishment hero to many Soviets by
attacking special privileges for party and government officials and
urging economic and political reforms be carried out more quickly.
   Muscovites in March gave him 89 percent of the vote in an
election for a city-wide seat in the new Congress of People's
Deputies. Last month, he was elected along with five other reformers
to the steering committee of the first organized opposition in the
Soviet parliament in 70 years.
   But Yeltsin's battle with party regulars has continued. At a
Central Committee meeting earlier this year, some party officials
demanded an investigation of his statements that they said ran
counter to party policy.
   Yeltsin accused the Moscow party apparatus of dirty tricks aimed
at upsetting his election campaign.
   In Houston, he said Americans were ``industrious, friendly, full
of good humor and vitality.'' The trip had changed his old
perception of Americans as ``generally crude and offensive.''
   Speaking Sunday to a luncheon sponsored by the University of
Miami Graduate School of Business Studies, he praised U.S. democracy
and farming techniques, adding ``of course, we shouldn't forget the
beautiful American women whom we've met.''
   Yeltsin's trip included meetings with President Bush and Vice
President Quayle and an unscheduled visit to former President Ronald
Reagan at a Minnesota clinic, where Reagan had undergone surgery.

   U.S. government officials will meet with island
representatives this week to begin mapping a foreign and domestic
policy for America's far-flung possessions in the Pacific and
Caribbean.
   ``The federal government has often failed to consider the
implications,'' effects and potential of the noncontiguous Pacific
areas, Congress said in 1986 when it passed legislation ordering a
policy to be formulated.
   ``Too often the federal government fails to take into account the
effects of its foreign and domestic policies on the unique
circumstances and character of the Pacific basin,'' said Guam
Congressional Delegate Ben Blaz, a Republican.
   Not since the Carter administration in 1980 has any U.S.
administration clearly defined a policy for federal agencies to deal
with the territories.
   A two-day conference, starting Tuesday, ``will be an excellent
opportunity for island leaders to lay their concerns on the table,
but more importantly, to work with federal officials to find
solutions,'' said Stella G. Guerra, who has been assistant interior
secretary for territorial and international affairs for two months.
   Federal agency representatives, headed by Interior Secretary
Manuel Lujan, will confer with officials from Hawaii, Guam, the
Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, the Marshall Islands, the
Federated States of Micronesia, Palau and the Virgin Islands.
   Guerra said discussions will target issues such as economic
development, the applicability of federal laws, social development,
U.S. foreign policy for the region and federal executive
organization.
   Of concern to Hawaii, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands are
the potential social, economic and political impact of migration of
people from the Marshalls, Federated States and Palau to urban
centers.
   The Virgin Islands were included because, although they are in
the Caribbean, they have problems in common with the Pacific
possessions, said Guerra.
   Excluding Hawaii, an estimated 350,000 people live on islands and
atolls in the almost empty expanse of the Pacific south of Japan,
east of the Philippines and north of Australia.
   What Guerra calls ``the American political family'' has been
changing, especially as the western Pacific islands move toward
their own political identities.
   In late 1986, the Reagan administration began dismantling the
U.N.-established Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.
   The Northern Mariana Islands became a U.S. commonwealth.
   The Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia
became self-governing and semi-autonomous under Compacts of Free
Association. The compacts will provide the two island states a
combined $2.5 billion through the year 2001. The United States
retains responsibility for their defense and mutual security.
   Palau, the fourth Trust Territory entity, still is a trusteeship
with the Interior Department administering its affairs.
   Guam, an unincorporated U.S. territory since 1950, is seeking
commonwealth status. Legislation is pending in the U.S. House of
Representatives.
   American Samoa is in its 89th year as a U.S. territory with no
serious indication of a change in its status.
   The Virgin Islands is discussing a new political arrangement.
   The Pacific possessions have been of military importance to the
United States' defense since all but American Samoa were captured
from Japanese occupation forces in bitter fighting 45 years ago.

   Don Cruse doesn't quite understand what
all the excitement is about _ all he did was score a perfect 1,600
on the Scholastic Aptitude Test.
   ``There really is no secret,'' said Cruse, a junior at Martin
High School. ``The test includes material that's covered in class.
And I have to study just like other students. I'm just not used to
all this attention.''
   But test administrators and Arlington school officials said the
16-year-old is too modest.
   Cruse was one of only 14 students in the nation who achieved a
perfect score on the SAT during the 1988-89 school year. The
national average score was 903.
   And while most students wait until their senior year to take the
college entrance exam, Cruse did it as a sophomore.
   Cruse's class schedule this semester includes Latin II,
pre-calculus, physics, English, history and biology. All but Latin
II are advanced classes.
   He told The Dallas Morning News he was thinking about going to
Harvard to be a pre-law major, and he's happy he doesn't have to

   ``I can concentrate on some other things now,'' he said.
   The SAT is a 2{-hour multiple-choice test that measures verbal
and mathematical reasoning. Scores are reported on a scale of 200 to
800 for each portion of the test. About 1.8 million high school
students took it during the last school year.

<HEAD>Marshal Rides In $55,000 Auto Seized From Drug Dealer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. marshal apparently has issued himself a
$55,000 Mercedes-Benz seized in a drug bust for use as a company
car, a newspaper reports.
   The car that has been driven to and from work by Basil ``Stu''
Baker, U.S. marshal for the Southern District of Texas, was seized
last year from a Jamaican drug dealer, the Houston Chronicle
reported, citing unidentified sources in the marshal's service.
   The 1988 gold-trimmed Mercedes, equipped with a cellular
telephone, is owned by the federal Drug Enforcement Administration
and is on loan to the marshal's service.
   Spoils of the illegal drug trade seized by authorities are not
intended for use by administrators, said Jim Griffith, an official
with the Seized Asset Division of the U.S. Marshal's Service. Seized
property usually is auctioned and the proceeds used to buy equipment
for federal drug agents.
   Marion Hambrick, special agent-in-charge of the DEA office in
Houston, said DEA policy prohibits assigning luxury cars to its
administrators.
   However, Hambrick said he asked that the marshal's service assign
the Mercedes to an administrator in that agency to lessen the risk
of its being damaged.
   Griffith said he was not aware that Baker was driving such a car.
   There was no immediate comment Monday from Baker. He was out of
his office and will not return until Sept. 25, a secretary said
Monday.
   Under federal law, the Drug Enforcement Administration and other
federal agencies may seize cash and other property from suspected
drug dealers. If the federal officials determine the property is
connected to the illegal drug trade, it legally may be forfeited to
the government and used by federal drug enforcement officials.
   The Mercedes was seized by DEA agents in August 1988 from the
Houston residence of Clacon James, a Jamaican drug dealer later
convicted of federal drug charges in McAllen and Florida.
   The car had been purchased the previous month by James and his
girlfriend for $55,000, in cash, said Greg Gladden, a lawyer
involved in the case.

<HEAD>Union Nixes Use of Donated Music For AIDS Video</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BAUDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Health Department spiked plans to
use 30 seconds of donated music in an AIDS prevention video after a
union said the musicians had to be paid for their work.
   The squabble spoiled plans to send the video to every junior and
senior high school in New York state for the beginning of the school
year, according to Health Department spokesman Peter Slocum.
   ``Based on our past history and experience, it had never occurred
to us that we would have run into this situation,'' Slocum said.
   The department had hoped that 10-second snippets of three popular
songs would lend a more realistic view to the video. The artists and
their record companies gave the state permission to use the songs
for free, but the American Federation of Musicians said no.
   The union said it had an obligation to make sure its members were
paid for their work, and didn't want to set a precedent. The Health
Department said the union had no spirit of public service.
   New York state schools are required to teach children about AIDS,
and the video prepared by the Health Department was designed to be
part of that curriculum.
   Titled ``Flashback,'' the video shows teen-agers being told about
the ways they can contract acquired immune deficiency syndrome,
usually spread through sexual contact or the sharing of needles.
   One ``flashback'' shows a teen-age party. For background, the
video producers wanted to include brief portions of three songs:
``Stand by Me'' by Ben E. King, ``A Shoulder to Cry On'' by Tommy
Page and ``Oh Yeah'' by Yello.
   ``We felt that using songs that kids would recognize and that are
popular for the students would lend reality to the situation and
increase the level of interest,'' Slocum said last week.
   But when the department sought union permission, in what it
expected to be a formality, the union unfurled its price scale. The
rates include $80.23 an hour for a musician and $160.46 for an
arranger.
   With 17 union musicians used in the recording of ``A Shoulder to
Cry On,'' the union calculated the Health Department owed $2,361.17.
``Stand By Me'' would cost a relatively economical $1,661.56.
   Health Department officials said they didn't bother to ask the
cost of using ``Oh Yeah.'' They just said ``Oh no'' to using the
music.
   ``We were very surprised because our experience at the Health
Department has been that we've received wonderful cooperation
throughout the years, not just in AIDS, but in all of our public
service announcements,'' Slocum said. ``We've never been turned down
before.''
   Patrick Havey, assistant to the president for the American
Federation of Musicians, said the union can't set a precedent by
refusing to insist on payments for work performed.
   ``We as a union don't have a right to compromise the rights of
musicians whose prerecorded music is used,'' Havey said. ``We don't
want anyone to feel that we're singling out the Department of
Health, because we're not. We've taken this position consistently
down the line.''
   The Health Department said it would use ``generic'' background
music that's part of the public domain. The schools should get their
videos delivered by early November, or two months later than planned.

   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's 10-point
peace plan has divided the major parties in Israel's coalition
Cabinet, with the right-wing Likud bloc against the plan and the
left-leaning Labor Party accepting it in principle.
   Here, at a glance, are the major points of Mubarak's plan; the
Likud and Labor positions; and an outline of Israel's peace plan
calling for Palestinian elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip, which Mubarak's proposals are meant to supplement.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>EGYPT'S PLAN</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   _Israel must accept the U.S-backed formula of trading land for
peace.
   _The 140,000 residents of Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem must
vote in any Palestinian elections in the occupied territories.
   _The building of Jewish settlements in the occupied lands must be
frozen.
   _The Palestinian delegation to preliminary talks with Israel in
Cairo must include Palestinians from outside the occupied lands _
possibly residents who were deported.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>LABOR STAND</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Labor accepts Egypt's plan as a means to start peace talks. It
accepts the formula of trading land for peace and voting by east
Jerusalemites.
   Labor officials agree to a freeze on Jewish settlements once
talks begin and suggest they would accept a role for deported
Palestinians in peace talks.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>LIKUD STAND</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Likud rejects Mubarak's plan as a threat to Israel's security. It
opposes trading land for peace, participation in voting by east
Jerusalem Arabs, and freezing settlements.
   Likud officials say talking to deported Palestinians would be
opening the way for talks with the Palestinian Liberation
Organization, which Israel considers a terrorist organization.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>THE ISRAELI PLAN:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   _Elections in the occupied lands will chose Palestinians to
negotiate with Israel on interim self-rule. The final status of the
territories will be decided later.
   _The U.S.-sponsored Camp David accords with Egypt will serve as

   _A comprehensive peace settlement must be reached with all Arab
nations.
   _An international effort will resolve the problems of Palestinian

<HEAD>Cheney Highlights Pentagon Role in Bush Drug Battle</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Combines pvs, editing throughout.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, declaring the
war on drugs a national security problem, ordered Pentagon chiefs
today to plan an attack on drug flow across the nation's borders
with stepped-up use of planes, radar and troops.
   ``I believe that our military forces have the capability to make
a substantial contribution toward drug interdiction, and I am asking
them to make the necessary preparations to carry out that
responsibility,'' Cheney said.
   In a news conference called to highlight the Pentagon's role in
President Bush's war on drugs, Cheney offered no specifics on how
much new money or personnel would be devoted to interdicting drugs
at the borders.
   He said he could not even give a ballpark cost estimate until the
plans are drawn up.
   Cheney said the Defense Department will not be drawn into a law
enforcement role in the anti-drug battle, and U.S. forces overseas
will not be put in combat situations.
   ``There's a clear line out there,'' Cheney said, that the
military will not cross.
   He acknowledged that using U.S. military personnel to train other
nations' forces can put people at risk.
   `It's a dangerous business. I hope nobody's hurt in the process,
but I can't guarantee it,'' Cheney said.
   Cheney ordered the nation's top military commanders to come up
with plans by Oct. 15 to help stem the flow of drugs through the
Caribbean and across the Mexican border.
   Cheney said he would instruct commanders to plan for:
   _A ``substantial'' Caribbean counter-narcotics task force, with
appropriate planes and ships, to cut the drug flow from Latin
America.
   _Deploying forces to support the counter-narcotics work of U.S.
law enforcement agencies and ``cooperating foreign governments,''
especially on the nation's southern border and the border with
Mexico.
   _Using NORAD (North American Aerospace Defense Command) to help
detect and counter illegal drug traffic across the borders.
   _Plan to combat the production and trafficking of illegal drugs
in conjunction with ``cooperating host countries.''
   Congress has been pressing the Pentagon to do more in the war on
drugs while military leaders have expressed reluctance about using
their ever-dwindling resources to enter a domestic war against
civilian drug-smugglers.
   But Cheney has convinced some military doubters of the need for a
new approach, primarily because of the size of the crack cocaine
epidemic and because the White House has demanded a new emphasis on
the issue, said a senior Defense Department official who did not
wish to be identified.
   Cheney plans to attack the problem of competing interests in the
drug war by improving ways of sharing intelligence information among
the agencies.
   One large question that remains unresolved is where the money for
the drug battle will be found.
   The official said Cheney's plan will not require any more funding
than that proposed by Bush, whose initial strategy has been widely
criticized on Capitol Hill for not being adequately funded or going
far enough.

<HEAD>Jiang Zemin's Road to the Top Could Be Rocky</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Jiang Zemin, the Communist Party chief whose name
has surfaced as the possible heir to senior leader Deng Xiaoping,
faces keen rivals and the vagaries of Chinese politics in any future
bid for greater power.
   Deng, China's 85-year-old patriarch, named the former Shanghai
mayor as his heir in ``informal talks'' with other senior officials
in May and June, The New York Times said Monday.
   Diplomats and Chinese sources, however, say Jiang's ascendancy
will be far from automatic.
   Deng's statements, which the Times said referred to Jiang as the
``core'' of the new generation of Chinese leaders, came as the
Communist Party moved to purge reformist party chief Zhao Ziyang.
   Zhao, accused of supporting the student-led, pro-democracy
movement crushed by the military June 3-4, was ousted from all his
posts on June 24 and replaced by Jiang.
   Jiang, 62, by assuming leadership of the 47-million-member
Communist Party, became the post powerful political figure in China
besides Deng, who retains the last word in all major decisions
although he has resigned from all but one of his official posts.
   Deng is still chairman of the Central Military Commission, a
crucial post in a nation where the military has a major say in
politics, particularly after the military suppression of student
dissent in June.
   Deng, widely reported to be suffering from prostate cancer, would
have approved Jiang as party chief with the understanding that Jiang
would become first among equals once Deng passes from the scene.
   But the former engineer and minister of the Electronics Industry
has had little experience in party politics and fewer ties to the
military.
   He has been in Shanghai the past four years as mayor and party
secretary and is said to lack the personal allegiances in Beijing
needed to sustain him in a serious power struggle.
   Jiang is certainly also aware that being Deng's heir apparent is
a highly dangerous position. The last two in his place were both
ousted from their jobs in disgrace for being too lenient toward
student demonstrators.
   The late party General Secretary Hu Yaobang was the first to go,
in January 1986, followed by Zhao in June. Zhao is reportedly under
house arrest and could still face criminal charges for allegedly
supporting what the government calls the ``counterrevolutionary
rebellion'' of this spring.
   Jiang, like Hu and Zhao, has been a solid supporter of Deng's
market-oriented reforms. While in Shanghai, Jiang, who speaks good
English, worked hard to attract foreign investment and modernize
industry in China's largest city.
   Unlike his two predecessors, Jiang has tried to solidify his
position by coming down hard on the need for party discipline and
loyalty to China's socialist system.
   ``We must sternly observe unified party discipline, namely: the
individual obeys the group, the minority obeys the majority, the
lower levels obey the upper levels, the whole party obeys the
center,'' he wrote in a recently published essay. ``We cannot allow
the unchecked spread of individualism, separatism and
money-worship.''
   If Deng were to suddenly leave the scene, Jiang would almost
certainly face strong competition for power from party
conservatives, led by Premier Li Peng and President Yang Shangkun.
   Yang, a robust 82, is a former general who has been general
secretary of the Central Military Commission for the past eight
years. He is the only viable choice at the moment to become chairman
of the commission if Deng were to depart, giving him powerful
leverage in any future political maneuverings.
   Yang is a comrade of Deng's going back to the civil war against
the Nationalists, but some observers feel Deng may try to hold on to
his commission post for a few more years to give Jiang more time to
build up his support within the party.
   Li, 60, joined Yang in declaring martial law in Beijing and
ordering the troops to attack the students and their supporters. He
is thought to be ambitious, and has proved to be ruthless.
   Another variable is the reformists _ Zhao and his supporters who
have been beaten into silence at the moment but, considering the
unpredictable nature of Chinese politics, could stage a comeback.
   If that happens, Jiang could turn out to be only a stopgap party
chief who will be washed into obscurity when the political tide
turns.

   Turkish authorities were questioning a
Soviet soldier who crossed into Turkey and asked for political
asylum, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported Monday.
   Emrullah Zeybek, the governor of the eastern Erzurum province,
told Anatolia the Soviet private was picked up by police after
apparently arriving on a train. He did not give the soldier's name
or say when he was picked up.
   The governor said the soldier's request for a asylum would be
taken under consideration if it became clear that he had defected
for political reasons.
   Zeybek said the soldier would be sent back to the Soviet Union if
it turned out he had a criminal record.
   Turkey has a 400-mile frontier with the Soviet Union.

   Thousands of employees ended a 4{-month-old
strike and returned to work at two state-run iron and steel plans
Monday after management approved a new contract granting them wage
increases.
   It was the longest, major strike in Turkey since the return to
civilian rule in 1983, and union officials said it cost Turkey
nearly $600 million.
   Strikes were banned during military rule in 1980-1983.
   Feridun Tankut, a spokesman for the independent Celik-Is Union,
said the talks were successfully concluded Sunday when management
agreed to increase workers' monthly wages from $60 to $310.
   He added that the workers will receive an additional 45 percent
increase in 1990, the last year of the two-year contract.
   Because of high inflation _ 75 percent last year and expected to
rise _ workers have been demanding large wage increases in contract
talks.

<TEXT>
   The region's mightiest hurricane in
a decade lashed Puerto Rico today after battering the U.S. Virgin
Islands and other tourist havens, leaving at least nine people dead
and thousands homeless.
   The National Weather Service said Hurricane Hugo hit the eastern
tip of Puerto Rico and skirted the northern coast, packing 125 mph
winds and a 6-foot tidal surges. Forecasters expected up to 15
inches of rain and flooding and mudslides all over the island.
   ``We're getting ravaged,'' said ham radio operator Fernando
Garcia in San Juan. ``Part of my aluminum siding is gone, my next
door neighbor's aluminum siding is gone ....''
   There were reports of heavy damage, some looting, no water and no
electricity in Puerto Rico.
   At noon EDT, Hugo's center was near latitude 18.6 degrees north
and longitude 66.0 west about 20 miles north of San Juan, said the
National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.
   On Sunday, Hugo plowed west-northwest through the eastern
Caribbean, slamming into the U.S. and British Virgin Islands with
100 mph winds and rains that caused heavy flooding and destroyed
homes.
   Five people were reported killed, 80 injured and more than 10,000
homeless on the French island of Guadeloupe, relief officials said.
Corrugated steel roofs were torn off, power lines ripped free and
crops were destroyed. The airport's control tower was knocked out of
commission, permitting only visual landings by relief planes.
   Two people were killed in Antigua and one in Montserrat,
according to Beacon Radio in Anguilla. Ham radio operators reported
at least five deaths in Montserrat, but there was no official
confirmation.
   Nearly all of Montserrat's 12,000 residents were homeless and
schools, hospitals and the police department all suffered serious
damage, said ham radio operator Stuart Haimes of Queens, N.Y.
   Police said a man was electrocuted in Puerto Rico when he touched
a power line while removing a TV antenna from his roof in preparing
for the storm.
   Off St. Thomas, charter boat captain O.B. O'Brian told CNN by
ship-to-shore telephone this morning:
   ``Looking down the lagoon, we see a lot of sailboats intertwined
and a lot of sails ripped and a lot of sails down. It looks pretty
bad ... There was a lot of wind.''
   Most of the Virgin Islands' 106,000 residents live on St. Thomas.
On St. Croix, a ham radio operator said the winds tore off the roofs
from up to 75 percent of the homes.
   Officials said stores in the St. Croix town of Christiansted were
heavily damaged, and there were reports of looting. National Guard
Adjutant Gen. Robert Moorehead said 1,000 people were evacuated to
rescue shelters in St. Croix.
   Storm watches were in effect for parts of the Dominican Republic,
and a hurricane warning was issued for the southern Bahamas,
including the Turks and Caicos islands.
   Hugo was moving at 10 mph west-northwest alongside Puerto Rico, a
U.S. commonwealth with 3.3 million people. Hurricane-force winds
extended up to 75 miles from its center. The weather service said
winds ripped the roof off a baseball stadium on the offshore island
of Vieques, about 10 miles to the east with about 7,000 residents.
   High winds Sunday blew roofs off six houses in the offshore
island of Culebra. Luis Munoz Marin International Airport, by far
the region's biggest, was closed, as were schools, banks, courts and
government offices.
   The National Guard had been mobilized in both the Virgin Islands
and Puerto Rico.
   Meteorologist Jesse Moore at the National Hurricane Center said
it was too early to tell whether Hugo would strike the U.S.
mainland. He said the storm was expected to be off the southeastern
Bahamas by Wednesday and ``after that, it's anybody's guess.''
   Residents of hilly areas where flash floods are a danger were
urged to evacuate, and Social Services Secretary Carmen Sonia Zayas
said 11,300 people were moved from flood-prone coastal areas to
rescue shelters.
   The Port Authority also said cruise ships scheduled to arrive in
San Juan, where one-third of the island population lives, had been
routed elswhere.
   Hugo uprooted trees and knocked out power in the British Virgin
Islands. On the resort island of Tortola in the British Virgin
Islands, residents said there were numerous injuries and scores of
homes destroyed.
   ``We are aware of the widespread damage. We may have to declare
the area a disaster area,'' said Louis Walters, education minister
in the British Virgin Islands.
   The Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico were last hit by a major
hurricane in 1956, when Betsy caused extensive damage and killed 11
people in Puerto Rico.
   Officials in Guadeloupe said many buildings were damaged.
   The mayor of St. Francois, a village on the island's eastern end,
told Radio Caraibe Internationale that there was nothing left of it.
   ``Aside from a few houses, almost all the rest were destroyed,''
said Mayor Ernest Moutoussamy. He said several hotels suffered
serious damage.
   In Paris, a plane was sent Sunday with 60 rescue workers and
emergency supplies for Guadeloupe, and two more were standing by
waiting for Caribbean airports to reopen.
   Hugo is the fourth hurricane of the Atlantic hurricane season,
which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.
   It is the most powerful hurricane to hit the region since
Hurricane David in 1979. That storm killed an estimated 1,200 people
in the Caribbean and Florida.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The director of the national AIDS program
office of the Public Health Service said Monday the government is
getting information to fight the disease while protecting the
privacy of its victims.
   Though the federal government has not enacted confidentiality
laws aimed specifically at AIDS patients, states have, Dr. James
Allen told the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on health and
the environment.
   ``State legal controls as well as the ethical traditions of the
health professions, and the management and administrative practices
of health care institutions, all protect the privacy of patients,''
Allen said.
   He said that when information about a person's HIV status is
disclosed, it is to help treatment of the patient and protect public
health.
   Allen was called before the subcommittee to summarize a report
requested by Congress and issued Monday on state confidentiality
laws regarding AIDS patients.
   Subcommittee chairman Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., said AIDS
patients had to be willing to seek treatment with the assurance they
would be protected from prosecution if they got the illness through
an illegal act such as intravenous drug use or homosexual relations,
which in some states is illegal.
   ``The Centers for Disease Control concluded in 1987 that hundreds
of thousands Americans should be counseled and tested for AIDS, but
that fears of breaches of confidentiality pose a major barrier to
getting these people into clinics,'' Waxman said.
   Allen said that besides the action taken by states to ensure
privacy, anti-discrimination legislation such as that recently
passed by the Senate would make AIDS victims more likely to come
forward.
   The proposed federal Americans with Disabilities Act, supported
by President Bush and awaiting action by the House, would prohibit
employers and others from discriminating against people with any one
of a wide range of physical or mental disabilities and is considered
the most expansive civil rights legislation since the Civil Rights
Act of 1964.

   Two crew members of a Danish freighter linked to an
alleged Caribbean cocaine-smuggling operation were ordered held
without bond on Monday.
   U.S. Magistrate Peter Palermo ruled Bent Mortensen, 47, and Bent
Nissen, 46, posed a danger of flight and placed them in the federal
Metropolitan Correctional Center south of Miami.
   Five other crew members of the 236-foot Nerma were ordered held
without bond last week.
   Seventeen people were charged with possession of cocaine with
intent to distribute in last week's seizure of about 2,700 pounds of
cocaine. If indicted and convicted, they could receive a maximum
sentence of life in prison.
   Authorities found 1,172 pounds of cocaine on the Nerma and two
other speedboats. Fifteen bales of cocaine were floating in the
water near the ship.
   An additional 1,540 pounds was confiscated on a fishing boat, the
J.J. Lorick, allegedly used to transport the drugs from the Nerma to
shore.

   The television industry saluted the
movies ``Roe vs. Wade'' and ``Day One'' with Emmy awards in bold
recognition of daring, sometimes opinionated programming.
   The mainstream Western miniseries ``Lonesome Dove'' was largely
ignored at Sunday night's 41st-annual presentations.
   ``War and Remembrance,'' television's graphic portrayal of the
Holocaust, captured the Emmy for best miniseries, a final triumph
for the 28}-hour epic that lost ABC a staggering $30 million because
of low ratings.
   NBC's ``L.A. Law'' and ``Cheers'' collected the top series awards.
   CBS' cynical newsroom comedy ``Murphy Brown,'' the touchy-feely
ABC drama ``thirtysomething,'' and Fox network's wacky
comedy-variety ``The Tracey Ullman Show'' each won four trophies.
   In a season where the networks dodged hostile advocacy goups and
nervous advertiser boycotts, the Academy of Television Arts and
Sciences embraced shows whose paths to the screen were most
torturous.
   ``Roe vs. Wade,'' the much-criticized account of the historic
battle for legalized abortion, captured an Emmy for Holly Hunter
(best actress in a miniseries or special) and shared the award for
top drama-comedy special.
   ``I'd like to thank NBC for getting this movie on the air,'' Miss
Hunter said in an acceptance speech greeted with knowing applause.
She thanked the real Jane Roe, Norma McCorvey, ``for continuing to
keep women from being second-class citizens, and for refusing to
give up her right for a reproductive choice.''
   CBS' ``Day One,'' an unflinching account of the personal and
scientific struggles behind the making of the atomic bomb, split the
drama-comedy prize with ``Roe vs. Wade.'' The award for ``Day One''
was the first for co-executive producer Aaron Spelling, whose
credits include ``Charlie's Angels'' and ``Nightingales.''
   ``Roe vs. Wade,'' subject to 20 network-ordered script rewrites,
and ``Day One'' each took four years to make.
   Although ``Lonesome Dove'' gathered a leading seven trophies, all
but one were awarded at Saturday's non-televised ceremony for
technical awards. The adaptation of Larry McMurtry's acclaimed novel
won only one category at the televised presentation Sunday, for
director Simon Wincer. It received 18 nominations, more than any
show.
   The NBC jurisprudence drama ``L.A. Law,'' which previously won as
best dramatic series in 1987, repeated Sunday night. So did
``Cheers,'' which was named best comedy series in 1983 and 1984.
   CBS, third in the A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings last season, collected
bragging rights for most awards with 27, followed by top-rated NBC
with 25 and ABC with 13. Newcomer Fox claimed its first Emmys,
finishing with four.
   ``It's a beginning,'' Barry Diller, chairman of Fox Inc. said
backstage. ``The first is always the best.''
   ``War and Remembrance,'' which some critics said took longer to
show than the war it chronicled, led the charge that stampeded
``Lonesome Dove'' out of town.
   The miniseries continued the saga writer Herman Wouk began in the
novel and miniseries ``The Winds of War,'' beginning one week after
Pearl Harbor.
   James Woods, who played the founder of Alcoholics Anonymous in
``My Name Is Bill W.,'' was named outstanding actor of a miniseries
or special.
   Woods, who won an Emmy two years ago for ``Promise,'' told the
audience he considered it ``truly an honor to play the man I
consider a saint.''
   Dana Delany won her first Emmy, for best actress in a dramatic
series, playing a compassionate nurse in the Vietnam War series
``China Beach,'' and Carroll O'Connor won for the crusty officer of
``In The Heat of the Night.'' It was O'Connor's fifth Emmy, his
first for a dramatic role.
   Also winning her first Emmy was Candice Bergen, who won lead
actress in a comedy series for her portrayal of the hard-driving
reporter in ``Murphy Brown.'' She closed her acceptance speech by
saying, ``Dad, if you're watching, this is for you.'' Her late
father, ventriloquist Edgar Bergen, was the founding president of
the television academy.
   Veteran comic actor Richard Mulligan of ``Empty Nest,'' who had
previously won for his zany role in ``Soap'' in 1980, also was a
popular winner.
   An ecstatic Tracey Ullman came on stage with her eight
co-producers to claim the award for outstanding variety, music or
comedy program for ``The Tracey Ullman Show.''
   Colleen Dewhurst was named Saturday for outstanding guest actress
in a comedy series as Miss Bergen's mother in ``Murphy Brown.'' She
added another Emmy on Sunday as supporting actress in a miniseries
or special for her role as Margaret Page in the NBC special ``Those
She Left Behind.''
   British actor Derek Jacobi was selected outstanding supporting
actor in a miniseries or special for playing the impostor G.I. in
Hallmark Hall of Fame's ``The Tenth Man.''
   The television academy governor's special award went to the late
Lucille Ball. ``Lucy loved her work and loved the television
industry,'' said the comedian's widower, Gary Morton, in accepting
the award. ``You made the Lucy I love very happy.''
   ``Cheers'' won best comedy series, and shy bartender Woody
Harrelson and brassy barmaid Rhea Perlman won best supporting
players in a comedy series.
   Larry Drake, who portrays the mentally retarded office worker
Benny Stulwicz of ``L.A. Law,'' and Melanie Mayron, the unmarried
man-hunter in ``thirtysomething,'' won for best supporting actor and
actress in a drama series.
   For the first time in 10 years, the Emmys presentation ended
before its allotted three hours.

   Prosecutors would not consider reducing charges
against former Black Panther leader Bobby Seale, who allegedly wrote
$11,000 in bad checks for expenses during a barbecue ribs cook-off.
   ``Even if he pays the money they're still going to push the
charges,'' said Seale's attorney, Terry Gilbert.
   Seale, 52, of Philadelphia, appeared Monday for a pretrial
hearing before Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Judge William Aurelius.
An Oct. 16 trial was scheduled.
   Seale was indicted on three counts of passing bad checks and one
of theft from a week's hotel stay. He also was indicted for
allegedly writing three bad checks for ribs for his booth at
Cleveland's National Rib Cook-Off in May 1988.
   Seale could be sentenced to five years in prison if convicted on
all counts.
   Seale, a community liaison in Temple University's
African-American studies department, has said cook-off promoters
urged him to lend his name and cooking talents to the event and
assumed his presence would increase sales. Instead, he said, sales
were poor and expenses high.

   Experts from the United States and 14 other
countries on Monday began trying to coordinate their attack on a key
aspect of the worldwide drug problem _ the laundering of profits
from narcotics.
   The one-day meeting, the first of a series, was largely
organizational and was characterized by participating officials as
``a first exchange of views on the measures needed to fight money
laundering.''
   The experts decided to organize their work around three themes _
evaluation of the money laundering phenomenon, reinforcement of
mutual judicial assistance and reinforcement of administrative
cooperation.
   The effort was mandated by the leaders of the world's seven
richest democracies during their summit meeting in July.
   In the final communique of the summit, the seven noted that the
drug problem had reached ``devastating proportions'' and proposed an
international task force to hit at the traffickers' profits.
   French Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy estimated that between
$200 billion and $400 billion are produced by the drug traffic every
year. This illicit money finds its way back into the world's economy
through numerous complicated schemes involving bogus companies and
countless bank transfers.
   A senior U.S. Treasury Department official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said: ``It is hard to find an issue that has
galvanized the world's attention as much as the drug issue has. It's
a truly global issue.''
   This meeting ``represents the most prominent recognition of the
fact that in order to get your arms around the drug problem, you
have to hit the economic and financial side of the house,'' the U.S.
official said. ``Like global commerce, there really is no boundary,
no water's edge.''
   Money laundering often begins in countries with strict bank
secrecy laws, such as the Dutch Antilles, the Cayman Islands,
Luxembourg and Switzerland. Investigators tracking money from drug
sales frequently bump up against a stone wall while trying to follow
the money trail through countries.
   While not mentioning names, Beregovoy stressed the need to get
around the bank secrecy of some countries in order to strike at the
traffickers.
   ``The maintenance of absolute bank secrecy seems to me to be
incompatible with the efficient fight against the laundering of drug
money,'' the French finance minister said last week. The answer, he
said, was that ``under judicial control and with agreement between
countries, it must be made possible to restrict bank secrecy in
order to seize money from drug trafficking.''
   Among those attending the meeting, presided over by Denis
Samuel-LaJeuness, assistant secretary for international affairs at
the French Treasury, were Switzerland and Luxembourg, frequently
cited by frustrated investigators as examples of countries whose
bank secrecy laws impede police.
   ``This is not a study group,'' Beregovoy said of the ``Financial
Action Task Force'' being created at this meeting. ``This group of
experts must devise and make action decisions.''
   The final communique of the July summit said the task force is to
analyze the problems and submit a report, with recommendations, in
April.
   ``It's work will cover the entirety of the problem,'' said
Beregovoy, ``our knowledge of the networks of drug money laundering,
channels, the places, the methods, amounts, reinforcement of mutual
judicial aid and the organization of administrative and financial
operations.''
   Other participants at the meeting included: West Germany, Canada,
Britain, Japan, Italy, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Spain, the
Netherlands, Sweden, and the European Commission, executive body of
the Common Market.

   An elderly man mistook another man for
someone he believed wronged him 10 years ago, and slit the man's
throat during a church camp meeting, authorities said Monday.
   James W. McGriff, 77, of Fayetteville, N.C., was charged with
murder after Sunday's slaying and remained in jail Monday pending a
bond hearing, Lancaster County Sheriff Williford Faile said.
   McGriff was accused of killing Daniel McCain, 66, of Monroe,
N.C., during a meeting attended by 200 to 300 people in an open
shelter at Steele Hill Methodist Church.
   Connie Belk said he sat next to McGriff during the meeting.
   ``They were between preachers, and (McGriff) ... just looked over
and said, `I'll be back directly,''' Belk said. ``He walked back six
or eight steps. ... I heard a noise, like `Ow!' or something behind
me, and I turned around. He had a knife with blood on it in his
hand.''
   McGriff mistakenly thought McCain had drugged his communion wine
at a similar church meeting 10 years and then laughed at him when he
awoke after passing out, the sheriff said.
   When he learned McCain, a retired public works employee, was not
the man he thought, McGriff said ``I cut the wrong man,'' the
sheriff said.

   The second of two rare beaked whales that
beached themselves died early Monday after a record 25 days in
captivity, officials at Marine World-Africa USA said.
   Hundreds of volunteers had helped care for the young marine
mammals, which had never before survived in captivity.
   The whale that died Monday, Alexander, was found Aug. 24 on Ocean
Beach in San Francisco with a second beaked whale that was named
Nicholas.
   Alexander had been suffering from pneumonia, but Marine World
President Mike Demetrios said the exact cause of death will not be
known for up to 10 days, when final results of a necrospy and
pathology tests are available.
   ``He did the same thing the other did right before it died,''
said Demetrios. ``He began swimming very rapidly around the pool.''
   Nicholas died of a severe case of pneumonia Sept. 8.
   Alexander had been eating well and was given a shot of
antibiotics Sunday night, and a volunteer was in the pool with the
whale when it died, he said.
   Marine researchers had not expected them to survive their first
night in captivity.
   ``We always know this can happen,'' said Demetrios. ``The chances
are terrible. But the longer they last, the more attached you
become. The more you root for them.''
   For the first time, researchers were able to record beaked
whales' vocalizations and collect footage of them swimming
underwater.
   The shy, deep-diving beaked whales are never seen within two or
three miles of shore, said Demetrios.
   People had sent dozens of get-well cards for the ailing pair and
a research fund had been established in their names.
   Researchers have not yet been able to verify which of 18 species
of beaked whale Nicholas and Alexander were.

   Five white defendants pleaded innocent Monday to
charges of murder in the racist killing of a black youth. Four were
allowed to remain free on bail, prompting an angry outcry from the
victim's father.
   ``You should have kept them in here,'' Moses Stewart, father of
Yusuf Hawkins, shouted at Justice Thaddeus Owens at state court in
Brooklyn. ``Letting murderers walk home ...''
   Owens responded by calling for order in the courtroom, which was
filled with supporters of Hawkins' family.
   ``I do a solo act here,'' the judge said.
   Minutes before, he accepted innocent pleas from James Patino, 24;
Keith Mondello, 18; Pasquale Raucci, 19; and Joseph Serrano, 19.
   The alleged triggerman, Joseph Fama, 18, appeared in court later
and also entered an innocent plea. He is being held without bail.
   Hawkins, 16, was shot to death Aug. 23 when he and three friends
went to the predominantly white Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn to
look at a used car that had been advertised for sale.
   The four black youths were set upon by a mob of about 30 whites
carrying bats, golf clubs and at least one bat. Police said the
whites mistakenly believed that Hawkins and his companions were
friends of a white neighborhood girl.
   The case has raised racial tensions in the city and is believed
to have been a factor in Mayor Edward I. Koch's defeat in last
week's Democratic primary.
   At Monday's hearing, Owens refused a prosecution request to raise
or revoke the $75,000 bail for Serrano and Patino, based on the new
indictment. Owens said he may reconsider the request after reviewing
the grand jury notes.
   Mondello is out on $100,000 bail and Raucci is out on $75,000
bail. Assistant District Attorney Paul Burns said he was not legally
able to ask for any change in their bail because the charges against
them had not changed.
   In a letter Saturday to Owens, Hawkins' father asked that bail be
revoked.
   ``These defendants have now been indicted for the most heinous
crimes in this society,'' Stewart said. ``Release on bail pending
trial sends a dangerous message to other persons who are
contemplating murdering a young person of African descent because of
race.''

   Mother Teresa suffered chest pains again
Monday, and her doctors said a temporary pacemaker had not improved
her heart condition.
   Nevertheless, a medical bulletin issued by the Woodlands Nursing
Home late Monday said Mother Teresa, who won a Nobel Peace Prize for
her work with the poor, was better and resting.
   Doctors said a persistent fever afflicting the 79-year-old Roman
Catholic nun seemed under control.
   ``Everything seems to be heading in the right direction, but her
anginal pain is causing anxiety,'' said Dr. George Lombardi, a
specialist in infectious diseases from Cornell University.
   Another doctor treating Mother Teresa denied reports that her
condition had deteriorated. ``This is nothing like that,'' he said.
``She is very, very weak. But we are confident that she'll get
better.''
   Mother Teresa has had chest pains off and on since Thursday.
   She also is being treated for an undisclosed infection that
doctors fear could pose another complication.
   Doctors also said blood tests showed Mother Teresa had a malaria
parasite. They said it was dormant and that although it was not
causing health problems, she was receiving an anti-malaria treatment.
   Mother Teresa was hospitalized on Sept. 5 with with an irregular
heartbeat, a blocked artery and high fever. She suffered a heart
attack three days later and doctors attached a temporary pacemaker
to help steady her heartbeat.
   But the cardiologist said, ``The pacemaker has not settled her
ischemia problems, and she is getting pains off and on.'' Ischemia
is a condition in which the heart beat is irregular.
   Born in Yugoslavia, Mother Teresa gave up a comfortable life as a
convent teacher to live and work among the suffering in Calcutta's
slums.
   She founded the Missionaries of Charity in October 1950 in an
abandoned rundown hostel donated by the city. The order, which was
formally recognized by the Vatican in 1965, expanded and now has
3,000 nuns working in 87 countries.
   Mother Teresa won the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize for her work.

   Nine years after he was ejected from a
Disneyland dance floor for dancing with a man, Andrew Exler returned
to the Magic Kingdom and received a warmer reception.
   Exler, 28, went dancing at the theme park Saturday night in a
group of eight male couples.
   ``A guard came up to us and asked if we had any problems with the
guests,'' Exler said. ``This really shows there has been a
turnaround in Disney practice.''
   On Sept. 13, 1980, Exler and Shawn Elliott were removed from the
Tomorrowland Terrace dance floor and the park because they were
dancing together.
   They sued over Disneyland's ban on dancing with members of the
same sex.In May 1984, an Orange County Superior Court jury found the
couple had been discriminated against.
   A judge issued an injunction that technically applied only to
Exler and Elliott. But Disney officials announced in 1985 they would
permit same-sex ``touch'' dancing.
   ``Basically, same-sex dancing is no longer considered a
problem,'' park spokesman Bob Roth said Monday. The policy against
it dated to the '50s.
   In February 1988, however, three men sued, alleging Disneyland
guards stopped them from slow-dancing together in April 1987. That
lawsuit is pending.

   Communist Party leaders converged on Moscow Monday
for a long-awaited Central Committee meeting on ethnic problems that
have left more than 200 people dead, one republic virtually
blockaded and mass movements calling for secession.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev first promised the special
session _ which begins Tuesday _ 18 months ago, after 31 people were
killed in Armenian-Azerbaijani rioting in the republic of Azerbaijan
in February 1988.
   Since then, ethnic tension in this country of more than 100
nationalities has worsened. Violence has broken out in Armenia,
Georgia, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan in addition to Azerbaijan. The
ethnic problems have combined with severe shortages of consumer
goods, food rationing and unsettling political changes _ all
threatening Gorbachev's program of perestroika, or economic and
social restructuring.
   Gorbachev said last week on national television that discordant
voices are speculating openly about the possibility of a coup,
imminent chaos, and even civil war.
   The Central Committee meeting will have to deal with a range of
problems.
   They include the following:
   _Armenians say their republic is being strangled by an economic
blockade launched by neighboring Azerbaijan, which controls the key
rail and highway access.
   _Millions of Baltic residents have signed documents favoring
independence for Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia.
   _110 enterprises with mostly Russian workers are on strike in
Soviet Moldavia over a law making Moldavian the official language of
the republic.
   The death toll of around 200 in the ethnic unrest includes 100
killed in rioting in the Fergana Valley of Uzbekistan in June and
more than 100 killed in violence between Armenians and Azerbaijanis
since February.
   Out of this unrest, the Communist Party says it hopes to create a
situation where all Soviet citizens can ``feel at home in any part
of the country.''
   A draft ethnic policy published for discussion last month calls
for restructuring the Soviet Union as a federation of republics with
broader autonomous powers and even suggests that the agreement that
created the union in 1922 could be rewritten.
   It blames the ethnic tension on disputes dating back centuries,
aggravated by dictator Josef Stalin's mass reprisals and
``resettlement'' of whole peoples, including the Crimean Tatars,
Meskhetian Turks, Germans, Koreans, Greeks, Kurds, Kalmyks,
Karachayevs, Balkarians, Chechen and Inkgush.
   It offers the republics the power to question national laws
before a strengthened high court and the right to use and distribute
their national resources. But it reserves for the national
government the right to decide ``property relations'' at a time when
Baltic leaders want to legalize private property.
   The proposed policy also calls for creation of new local councils
for small minorities, and national associations for groups with no
territory of their own.
   Legally, such changes would have to be approved by the new
Supreme Soviet legislature. But its deputies are overwhelmingly
Communist Party members, and the legislators are only beginning to
stray from the party line in their debates and actions.
   There is nothing in the proposal that offers specific solutions
to disputes in the Baltics, the Caucasus, Central Asia or anywhere
else.
   It does suggest creating a new government body to handle such
problems _ a proposal in line with Gorbachev's plan to shift power
from the party to the government.
   Armenian leaders plan to ask the party meeting to break an
economic blockade imposed by Azerbaijan, Rem Ananikyan, an editor of
the official Armenpress news agency in Yerevan, said in a telephone
interview.
   Armenian party chief Suren Arutyunyan and Azerbaijan leader
Abdul-Rakhman Vezirov are among those who will attend the meeting.
   About 80 percent of Armenia's shipments from other parts of the
Soviet Union arrive by road and rail through Azerbaijan. Armenians
say they have received almost nothing through Azerbaijan for nearly
two months.
   The two republics have been locked for the past 18 months in a
bitter territorial dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh. The predominantly
Armenian population demands that the region be taken from Azerbaijan
and annexed to Armenia. Moscow has imposed direct rule on the
region, but Azerbaijan's parliament Saturday demanded return of its
authority.
   The official Soviet press has reported that even ambulances are
at a standstill in the Armenian capital, Yerevan, because there is
no fuel.
   ``There's no salt. There's no sugar. There's no oil,'' Ananikyan
said when asked about supplies in Yerevan stores. ``The vegetables
are not being harvested because there's no fuel.''
   Armenian officials say builders in northern Armenia who are
reconstructing cities leveled the earthquake Dec. 7 are out of
supplies. That means many people may be without shelter as winter
approaches, they say.
   Supplies also have been cut off from Nagorno-Karabakh, official
news reports said.
   Pravda reported Monday that five people were killed when a bomb
exploded in an intercity bus in the Azerbaijani town of Evlakh, six
hours after the bus left Tbilisi, the capital of the Georgian
republic. Authorities do not know if the explosion Saturday was
related to ethnic tensions between Azerbaijanis and Georgians.

   The Commerce Department announced today the
United States is prepared to provide Hungary with a wide series of
business and economic benefits, including permanent
most-favored-nation trade status.
   It would make Hungary the first Eastern European nation having
such status since enactment of the Jackson-Vanik Amendment in 1974
tying those benefits to free emigration policies, the department
said. Yugoslavia and Poland also have MFN status, but obtained
theirs before 1974.
   In addition, Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher said the
United States is prepared to improve tariff treatment of Hungarian
products, extend development programs and create a $25 million fund
to help create private business in the Marxist country.
   ``This step is an important part of implementing President Bush's
goal of building an American partnership with Hungary,'' Mosbacher
said in a statement following a meeting with Hungarian Trade
Minister Tamas Beck in Budapest. A copy was made available here.
   ``Such an agreement is fundamental for private sector business
because it would contain investment protection gauartees which boost
confidence and open the way to substantially increased U.S. private
investment in Hungary,'' Mosbacher said.
   He said Beck agreed to open negotiations on the proposals.
   Mosbacher said the proposals include granting Hungary permanent
most-favored-nation trade status in October if the Hungarian
parliament, as expected, enacts legislation on freedom of emigration
by the end of September.
   Such status assures that exports to the United States will not
face discriminatory tariffs. Hungary now receives such benefits only
on a year-to-year basis.
   Mosbacher also said the plan calls for extending Generalized
System of Preferences treatment that would offer Hungarian exporters
duty-free tariff treatment for a broad range of exports to the
United States.
   The commerce secretary said Bush also has submitted to Congress
legislation to extend Overseas Private Investment Corp. programs to
Hungary and create a $256 million Private Enterprise Fund.
   OPIC programs would provide investment guarantees to U.S.
companies investing in Hungary and the enterprise fund would help
establish of private business there.

   Dan Aykroyd, one of the original Blues
Brothers, says the 1990s will be ripe for a rebirth of the Memphis
sound.
   ``The Memphis sound is fat,'' said the comedian-singer, who
performed as his alter-ego, Elwood Blues, at a concert for the
groundbreaking of The Great American Pyramid, an
entertainment-sports complex.
   ``I guess for me it's the combination of everything. Mainly,
probably just the rhythm and the horns. You can't stop them. It's
just danceable, that's what I loved.''
   Aykroyd, who created the Blues Brothers team with the late John
Belushi on segments of Saturday Night Live, said he is a fan of
Memphis, New Orleans and Chicago blues.
   ``The Chicago electrified sound kind of rides over everything,''
he said. ``Guitar playing in Memphis music sort of builds into that
whole fatness.''
   Aykroyd said he hopes the new complex rejuvenates the Memphis
music scene.
   ``Wherever in the world we can find a city that can bring back an
individual sound and call it its own, I think we should try to
encourage it,'' he said before Friday's concert.

   Woody Harrelson plays a bartender on the
television show ``Cheers'' but he might have a future playing golf.
   Harrelson sank a 6-foot putt under coaching from teammate and pro
golfer Tim Simpson during the second annual Kenny Rogers Classic
weekend sports competition. Sunday's crucial stroke gave his team
the championship title.
   ``The single most exciting event in my entire life,'' Harrelson
said after his putt and a congratulatory lift from another teammate,
Michael Jordan, a star with the NBA's Chicago Bulls.
   ``Are you going to put out a golf video now?'' asked Alan Thicke,
star of TV's ``Growing Pains.''
   Other athletes in the event were Dominique Wilkins of the Atlanta
Hawks, former NBA star Julius ``Doctor J'' Erving and tennis pro
Jimmy Connors.
   The events were staged on Rogers' 1,200-acre Beaver Dam Farms,
featuring an 18-hole golf course, three tennis courts, a horse barn
large enough to house a basketball court and several stocked lakes.
   It drew 10,000 spectators and raised $40,000 for homeless
shelters in the Athens area, 15 miles southwest of Rogers' farm.

   Willie Nelson became an honorary North
Dakota Centennial Farmer in recognition of his Farm Aid concerts,
but he said his songs are not enough to solve their problems.
   State Agriculture Commissioner Sarah Vogel presented a centennial
plaque and several state-made products to Nelson, who performed
before an estimated 1,800 people Sunday night.
   The performance was not an official Farm Aid concert, but was one
in a series at the University of North Dakota.
   Nelson, founder and chairman of Farm Aid, Inc., said his Farm Aid
concerts have raised more than $10 million since they began in 1985.
But he acknowledged their limitations.
   ``It's sort of a drop in the bucket in one way,'' he said.
``These people have been helped, but their problems haven't been
solved.''
   He said there is no longer any incentive for young people to
pursue careers in farming, and that will eventually bring a crisis
in the industry.
   But Vogel was optimistic.
   ``Farm Aid has made a lot of difference in North Dakota,'' she
said. ``People have food that they wouldn't have without Farm Aid.''

show business.
   Tennille, who along with her husband, Daryl Dragon, are better
known as The Captain and Tennille, said they officially ended their
touring act this year to pursue other interests.
   Since moving to this resort community on Lake Tahoe's east shore
in 1984, Tennille has become an avid hiker who has conquered the
Tahoe Basin's highest peaks and climbed Mount Whitney twice. At
14,495 feet, Whitney is the highest peak in the continental U.S.
   She also formed a hiking group called Women in the Sierra, which
makes annual week-long treks into the Sierra high country.
   ``It's like being a Girl Scout again,'' said Tennille, now 49 and
a self-described environmentalist. ``You leave your husband, the
kids, the telephones, the fax machines, everything behind and just
see the land the way it was before we screwed it up.''

   Sultan Azlan Shah on Monday raised
a ceremonial sword and kissed its hilt in a ceremony installing him
as the ninth king of this former British colony.
   As the 61-year-old former Supreme Court justice carried out the
ceremony, which dates back five centuries, his wife, Tuanku Bainun,
seated on the royal yellow throne with a diamond tiara,
automatically became queen of the 17 million Malaysians.
   Palace officials involved in the ceremony at the chandeliered
throne room of the white-domed National Palace said it was not
called a coronation, as in the West, because at no point is a crown
placed on the king's head.
   The king wore a white tengkolok, or Malay royal headdress, made
of silk with the state crest in diamonds pinned at the top. He
entered the ceremonial room in a black suit embroidered with golden
thread.
   Soon after the king was seated on the throne, he was presented
with the kris by the Lord Chamberlain. He rose and kissed the sword,
which has a wavy blade and is embedded with precious stones.
   The ceremony was witnessed by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and
690 invited guests.
   Also present was Malaysia's first Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul
Rahman, who invented the system of electing Malaysia's national king
for a five-year term by secret ballot from among the nine rulers, or
sultans, of nine Malay states.
   Tunku, himself a prince from Kedah state, wanted to preserve the
monarchy after Malaysia gained independence in 1957. Since all the
sultans wanted to be king, it was decided they would meet and vote
by secret ballot, electing one for a five-year term, after which he
would return to rule his own state.
   Another sultan is elected deputy king, acting for the king when
he is abroad or ill.
   Sultan Azlan was elected king in a secret ballot March 2.
   He was sworn into office April 26 and began his duties before
Monday's formal installation _ a national holiday complete with
fireworks displays, music, dance and other public entertainment.
   Malaysia's king is a constitutional head of state like Britain's
Queen Elizabeth II or Emperor Akihito of Japan. Political power
rests with a British-style national parliament and the prime
minister.
   Sultan Azlan and his deputy head the Moslem religion in Malaysia.
   The new king was born Raja Azlan on April 19, 1928 to one of the
Perak Royal Families of the Batu Gajah district, 80 miles north of
Kuala Lumpur.
   He studied in local schools before attending Nottingham
University in England, graduating with a law degree in 1955. He then
returned to Malaysia and joined the legal service, becoming in 1982
Lord President of the Supreme Court, the highest ranking judge in
Malaysia.

<HEAD>Peace Talks Resume Tuesday at Carter Center</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Representatives of Ethiopia and the Eritrean
rebels return to the negotiating table Tuesday to resume preliminary
peace talks they hope could pave the way to ending their 28-year war.
   The delegations recessed over the weekend while former President
Jimmy Carter was in Nicaragua on a fact-finding mission. Tuesday
will be the ninth day of negotiations at the Atlanta-based Carter
Center.
   Carter Center officials are not sure whether the talks will end
Tuesday, said center spokeswoman Beth Carpenter.
   Carter said Friday that the Ethiopian government and the Eritrean
People's Liberation Front had agreed to hold additional talks in
Africa and had made much progress toward setting an agenda for those
talks.
   He said they agreed on items such as the official languages,
publicity, recording and procedural rules for the talks, which would
be held in one or more of these nations: North Yemen, Egypt, Sudan,
Kenya, Tanzania and Zimbabwe.
   About 1 million people have died in fighting and famine related
to the war over the independence of Eritrea, a northern province in
the Horn of Africa that contains Ethiopia's only direct access to
the Red Sea.
   The Eritrean Front in the past has demanded that the people of
Eritrea be allowed to vote on whether they want independence,
federation with Ethiopia or autonomy. The Ethiopian government,
which has proposed a greater measure of autonomy for its
northernmost province, has unequivocally ruled out any referendum.
   Carter has acted as a neutral observer at the Atlanta talks,
which were convened Sept. 7 to draft an agenda for future,
substantive peace negotiations.
   Carter has said the delegations are ``so proud of what they've
done so far'' by holding the talks ``that they are inclined to look
upon this partial success as adequate.''
   The talks have included joint meetings between the Ethiopians and
Eritreans as well as separate sessions with Carter and each side.

<HEAD>More Than Four Percent of Prisoners Infected with AIDS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blood tests of prison and jail inmates across the
country show that about one in 24 is infected with the AIDS virus,
fewer than expected, researchers said Monday.
   The study is the first to try to estimate the prevalence of AIDS
in prisoners, said its principal author, Dr. Ford Brewer of the
Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health in
Baltimore.
   The 11,198 inmates in the study came from 10 prisons and jails.
   ``They were selected to give us a pretty good overall picture''
of the extent of AIDS infection in inmates, Brewer said at a meeting
of the American Society for Microbiology, where he presented his
results.
   Of the inmates tested, 476, or 4.25 percent, were infected with
AIDS, Brewer reported. Smaller local studies by others had found
infection rates of up to 3.2 percent among prisoners, with the
exception of one New York City study that found 17.4 percent of
inmates were infected, Brewer said.
   Brewer found the highest rates of infection, up to 8 percent, in
the mid-Atlantic states, reflecting the high prevalence of AIDS
infections in that population, he said. As few as 2.7 percent of the
inmates were infected in one jail on the West Coast.
   The figures at all the institutions were lower than expected,
Brewer said. ``Most of these prison and jails thought it was going
to be four or five times as high,'' he said.
   That is because other surveys have found that between 27 percent
and 41 percent of inmates report that they are intravenous drug
abusers, and between 3.6 percent and 7 percent report that they have
engaged in homosexual activity.
   Homosexuals and intravenous drug abusers are the groups most
affected by AIDS so far.
   Blood for the testing was obtained from the inmates during
routine medical screening when they entered the jails and prisons,
Brewer said. The blood was frozen and immediately shipped to Johns
Hopkins for testing.
   Brewer said 3,136 cases of AIDS had been reported among prisoners
as of October 1988. With about 3 million adults in prisons and jails
in the United States, his estimate of the number infected with the
AIDS virus suggests that the number of cases will climb as infected
inmates become ill.
   Corrections officials will be required to prepare for treatment
of these inmates, he said. Furthermore, education and monitoring of
inmates can help slow the spread of AIDS, Brewer said.
   The study was conceived in 1984, but Brewer faced numerous
obstacles in getting permission to test inmates' blood for AIDS.
   ``Everybody was concerned that big brother was going to swoop
down'' and that the testing would result in discrimination against
the prisoners, Brewer said.
   The study was funded by the federal Centers for Disease Control
in Atlanta. The CDC is now taking over the study and incorporating
it into its surveys of AIDS infection, said Ida Onorato of the CDC.
   Onorato reported in a separate study that the rate of AIDS
infection among intravenous drug abusers going to drug treatment
clinics ranged as high as 48.8 percent.
   Infection rates were highest in the East and in metropolitan
areas, as they were with the prison study, she said.

<HEAD>Kemp Promises To Root Out Influence Peddling; Asks Congress For Help</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal housing officials promised Congress on
Monday to permanently remove influence peddling from a
scandal-tarred program and sought help in reversing a court decision
they said could cost the agency more than past abuses.
   The promise and request from top aides to Housing and Urban
Development Secretary Jack Kemp came at a Senate Banking Committee
hearing that also included testimony from a former Florida housing
official who said he despised the way some rental subsidies were
awarded through political connections but didn't complain because it
was the only way to get needed assistance.
   And the panel's chairman, Sen. Donald Riegle, said he planned to
call before the committee all of the major figures mentioned in
allegations of abuses at HUD, including former Secretary Samuel
Pierce and his top aides. His decision was seen as an indication
that the Senate would expand its review of HUD during the Reagan
administration to rival a House investigation of favoritism and
abuse at the department during Pierce's tenure.
   The hearing focused on HUD's Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation
Program, the subject of a scathing report earlier this year in which
HUD's inspector general said that lucrative subsidies were awarded
to former HUD officials or other developers who retained prominent
Republican consultants.
   Much of the influence peddling was blamed on a 1984 decision to
repeal a ``fair share'' formula through which the subsidies were
awarded to local housing authorities that demonstrated a need for
the low-income housing and the ability to administer the program.
   After Congress repealed the formula, HUD headquarters assumed
most of the funding authority and had wide latitude in awarding
subsidies, creating a climate the inspector general said allowed
political favoritism to flourish.
   Kemp, however, voluntarily decided to revert to using the ``fair
share'' approach and his deputies said the department would continue
to do so if the program is funded next year, which is still in
question.
   ``There's no question about that,'' James Logue, HUD's deputy
assistant secretary for multifamily housing, said when asked whether
Kemp was committed to the fair-share formula.
   The inspector general also found that many ``Mod-Rehab'' projects
were approved at excessive rents, costing the government hundreds of
millions of dollars over the 15-year subsidy contracts.
   Logue said about 300 of the projects will be audited in the first
quarter of the new fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1, and that HUD
would move to lower the rent subsidies if they were inappropriately
calculated.
   Kemp, at a prior hearing, agreed with a congressman's
``ballpark'' estimate that abuses at the agency during Pierce's
tenure likely would cost taxpayers about $2 billion.
   Logue on Monday said a recent court decision rejecting HUD's
formula for granting rent increases to Section 8 projects could cost
the government as much as $2.5 billion over the next decade and
asked the committee to take legislative steps to reverse the court's
action.
   In the ruling, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected HUD's
use of market comparability studies to determine the annual rent
increases granted for subsidized rental housing.
   Logue said the ruling would cost HUD about $150 million in the
9th Circuit's jurisdiction, which includes nine Western states, and
if applied nationwide could cost the government between $600 million
and $1 billion in retroactive payments and up to an additional $1.5
billion over the next decade.
   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., who presided over most of the hearing,
said the committee would consider the request.
   Graham and other committee members spent more than an hour
questioning Melvin J. Adams, the former director of the housing
department in Dade County, Fla., who said political contacts were
the key to winning Mod Rehab subsidies and that Dade County got more
than its fair share of the awards.
   ``I thought it was not right but it was benefiting people I
wanted to provide housing for,'' Adams said. ``Had I just blown the
whistle, that's what I would have gotten _ nothing.''

   President Bush, seeking ``to awaken a new
spirit of environmentalism,'' appealed to Westerners today to help
reforest America and unveiled plans to train Peace Corps volunteers
to help protect the environment in developing countries.
   The president, on a cross-country trek through the centennial
states of South Dakota, Montana and Washington, preached the gospel
of conservation and environmental ``stewardship'' to audiences he
said needed little convincing.
   In remarks prepared for delivery as he planted a centennial elm
on the lawn of the Montana State Capitol, Bush spoke of ``the need
to awaken a new spirit of environmentalism across America.''
   And he said acid rain, global warming and the destruction of
Brazil's rain forests all demonstrate ``that protecting the
environment is a global issue.''
   Earlier, Bush appealed to South Dakotans as he planted an elm in
Sioux Falls to ``join the new greening of America'' by planting
trees in their own backyards.
   ``We need to reforest this bountiful land,'' Bush said.
   Citing U.S. plans to ban ocean dumping of sewage by 1991 and
prohibit release of chlorofluorocarbons into the atmosphere by the
year 2000, Bush said, ``We can't stop there. We've got to work with
the rest of the world to preserve the planet.''
   Starting next year, he announced, ``as part of their standard
preparation for duty, Peace Corp volunteers will be trained by the
(Environmental Protection Agency) to deal with a full range of
environmental challenges: Water pollution prevention. Waste
disposal. Reforestation. Pesticide management.''

   Later, in an address to a five-state legislators conference
inside the Montana Capitol, Bush said his new national anti-drug
strategy ``needs your help. We need the states to toughen their
laws'' against narcotics and violent crime.
   Bush, looking to next week's summit with the governors, also said
America's schools are ``not making the grade. ... It is time for
change _ perhaps radical change _ to find new ways to improve
educational performance.''

   Bush was holding a news conference before departing Helena for
Spokane, Wash., where he had another centennial tree-planting
scheduled Tuesday with Rep. Thomas Foley, the Democratic speaker of
the House.
   The president rode into the Sioux Falls Arena on a horse-drawn
covered wagon to the cheers of 10,000 people. Sharing the ride
aboard what Bush called ``Buckboard One'' were South Dakota Gov.
George S. Michelson and a dozen students who had written
prize-winning centennial essays.
   Michelson, a Republican, hailed Bush's plans to hold an education
summit with the governors next week and assured him, ``We in rural
America are anxious to join in the war on drugs because we are not
exempt from the problem.''
   In a pitch for his proposals to toughen the Clean Air Act and
reduce acid rain and smog, Bush said, ``It's not enough to stop
dirtying the air. We've got to clean it up.
   ``And to help do that, we should remember the oldest, cheapest
and most efficient air purifier on Earth: trees,'' said the
president, who was himself planting centennial trees here and in
Helena today, and in Spokane, Wash., on Tuesday.
   Last April, Bush planted his first centennial tree in Bismarck,
N.D. Officials in that state have pledged to plant 100 million trees
by the year 2000.
   ``I challenge you to come up with a pledge of your own, to join
the new greening of America by foresting South Dakota with
centennial trees,'' the president said.
   ``It doesn't take a federal program. It doesn't take a new
bureaucracy. And it sure doesn't take some fancy new study,'' he
said. ``What it takes is a shovel. It is a family project you can do
in your own homes, literally in your own back yards.''
   Bush said the federal government planted just 340,000 acres of
trees last year, while private efforts, families and businesses
``planted eight times that number _ enough to blanket an area almost
the size of Connecticut.''
   He said tree-planting can exemplify his theme of volunteerism in
America, the so-called ``thousand points of light'' Bush evoked
during his election campaign.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush wanted to use
the cross-country trip to build support for his $7.9 billion
anti-drug strategy, which Democrats in Congress want to expand.
   There was a small glitch with the tree Bush planted in Bismarck
last April 24. A local forester discovered that the tree,
transplanted from the White House lawn, was carrying several tiny
larvae of the gypsy moth _ the leaf-eating insect that has
devastated elms in many Eastern and some Western states.
   The larvae were removed and the centennial tree _ a descendant of
one planted by President John Quincy Adams _ was thoroughly sprayed
with insecticide.
   In Sioux Falls today, Bush quipped, ``Not every president is
blessed with a green thumb.'' Noting that the last centennial tree
he planted had ``some kind of moth disease,'' he said, ``So far, I'm
having about as much luck planting as I did fishing'' during his
recent vacation in Maine.

<HEAD>Task Force Formed to Assess Nation's Needs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate Democratic task force to assess the
nation's housing needs and recommend reforms in the Department of
Housing and Urban Development was named Monday by Majority Leader
George Mitchell.
   Sen. Alan Cranston of California, named to head the eight-member
task force, said one of its purposes will be to prod the Bush
administration to take a position on housing for the disadvantaged.
   ``There are still people in the administration who don't want to
see any national housing programs,'' Cranston said.
   He said the eventual aim is to forge a bipartisan approach on
housing and produce a bill President Bush will sign.
   ``The problems of housing affordability are not going away; they
continue to build pressure on millions of Americans,'' Cranston said
in a statement.
   ``Young failies find it harder to buy their first home. Older
people can't find housing that enables them to live with dignity and
independence. The supply of decent housing that low-income people
can afford is fast disappearing. Homelessness remains a shame on the
nation.''
   Mitchell said the task force will issue a report and make
recommendations by the end of the year. He said comprehensive
housing legislation ``will be a high priority for next year.''
   Cranston said he believes such a bill should include a sweeping
overhaul of HUD.
   ``It should prevent any repeat of the recent scandal by ensuring
that HUD resources are used fairly to provide as much decent,
affordable housing as possible where it is most needed,'' he said.
``Insider dealing, rip-offs by consultants and excessive profits
through double-dipping must be eliminated with stiff penalties.''
   Cranston said the legislation also should modernize and rebuild
the Federal Housing Administration, holding managers accountable for
financing and program effectiveness and bringing up to date
financial controls and accounting systems.
   At present, he said, unrealistic FHA mortgage regulations have
``knocked FHA (loans) totally out of the market in many parts of the
country,''
   The bill also should seek to build a national network of
partnerships, including states, communities, private industry,
non-profit organizations and the federal government, to provide an
adequate supply of affordable housing, Cranston said.
   Other members of the task force are Sens. Christopher Dodd,
D-Conn.; Bob Graham, D-Fla.; John Kerry, D-Mass.; Barbara Mikulski,
D-Md.; Donald Riegle, D-Mich.; Terry Sanford, D-N.C., and Paul
Sarbanes, D-Md.

   State Supreme Court Justice Nicholas Colabella convicted Frank
Thomas, 67, of two counts but acquitted him of five additional
counts. He had dismissed an eighth count earlier.
   Colabella's verdict came after a two-week, non-jury trial in New
York state's trial-level court.
   Thomas, who lives in New Rochelle, had been charged with the
deaths of the eight people because the boardinghouse violated
several provisions of the fire code. A fire door was missing, and
the front door was secured by a double dead-bolt lock, which
required a key from the inside to open.
   Thomas was convicted on the two counts in the deaths of Abraham
Wilson, 52, and Allen Piroleau, 61, whose bodies were found by the
door they could not open.
   The Jan. 15 blaze began in the basement of the building through a
resident's careless smoking and spread rapidly.
   Thomas declined to comment on the verdict. He faces 1 1-3 to four
years in prison on each count when he is sentenced Nov. 2.
   His attorney, Neal Comer, said he would appeal.
   He argued that building and fire inspectors had never cited
Thomas for the failure to have a fire retardant door between floors.
Comer said the special lock had been requested by the tenants, who
were concerned about drug addicts outside.
   Westchester District Attorney Carl Vergari's office seized
records of city agencies to determine why full inspections had not
been done in as much as a decade.

   City officials have promised to post a safety
officer at an intersection where seven children were struck by a car.
   Police spokesman James Jordan said a safety officer would staff
the post in the Dorchester neighborhood until more permanent
safeguards are in place.
   Meanwhile, the condition of several of the seven injured children
improved.
   Two of the children remained in critical condition on Sunday
night, while one was in stable and the other four were in good
condition, spokesmen at Boston City and Children's hospitals said.
   The children were on their way home from school when a station
wagon that had been struck by another car careened out of control
and plowed into them, witnesses said.
   Police said the driver of the first car, Joao Centeio, 37, of
Boston, had failed to stop at a stop sign. He was charged with
reckless operation, driving to endanger, driving without
registration and failing to stop at the sign.
   Centeio told reporters through an interpreter that he did not run
the stop sign.

<HEAD>Trees Come Between Bush and Reagan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush has finally broken with Ronald
Reagan. The issue: trees.
   Where Reagan saw trees as a pervasive polluter of the atmosphere,
his successor praises them as ``the oldest, cheapest and most
efficient air purifier on Earth.''
   Reagan said nine years ago that more atmospheric contamination
was caused by natural processes than manmade pollution. But Bush
declared Monday that it's tree planting time ``for America and for
all of spaceship Earth.''
   Reagan contended during the 1980 presidential campaign that trees
were responsible for 93 percent of the nitrogen oxides in the
atmosphere. Environmentalists said Reagan confused nitrous oxide,
which comes from decaying plant matter and isn't harmful, with
nitrogen oxide, a pollutant emitted by coal plants.
   The theory prompted Reagan press secretary James Brady, who was
in the campaign plane as it flew over a burning forest, to shout in
jest: ``Killer Trees! Killer Trees!''
   Bush came down on the side of environmentalists in a speech in
Sioux Falls, S.D., inviting his audience ``to join the greening of
America.''
   Trees, he said, ``can reduce the heat of a summer's day, quiet a
highway's noise, feed the hungry, provide shelter from the wind and
warmth in the winter.''
   ``Every tree,'' he said, ``is a compact between generations.''
   All true, says Neil Sampson, a vice president of the American
Forestry Association.
   ``We've got a tremendous opportunity to affect the environment
with trees and that can start for many people right around their
house,'' he said. ``This is not rocket science. It doesn't take new
technology, it doesn't cause us to go to heroic investments.
   ``It isn't going to cure the whole world either, but at least
it's a start of doing something positive: We know how to do it
today, we've got the money to do it and we have people who know how
to do it.''
   The ``plant a tree'' idea comes late.
   Since the first Europeans set foot on America's shores, about 300
million acres of forests have disappeared to build cities and
provide land for fields and roads.
   Of the 2\ billion acres that make up the United States, 737
million acres are forest, Sampson said.
   He suggested cities are the place to start planting trees.
   ``Most cities are under a heat island effect. They are four
degrees warmer than the suburbs and that seems to be rising by one
degree per decade,'' he said. ``For each degree of heat, we power
consumers in Washington pay an extra $10,000 an hour.''
   In the process of growing wood, trees take in carbon dioxide _
the stuff we exhale _ convert it into cellulose and breathe out
oxygen. They also act like huge coolers by evaporating water, which
absorbs heat as it moves from liquid to a vapor.
   Bush challenged South Dakotans to pledge to plant 100 million
trees by 2000, something North Dakotans already have promised to do.
Sampson said his group has been urging 100 million new trees, too,
but around homes and businesses under a program called ``Global
Releaf.''
   He said that Los Angeles, a year before the city was to be the
site of the 1984 Olympics, planted 1 million trees. Air pollution
experts believe that was the single most cost-effective way to
improve air quality, Sampson said.
   Houston is aiming for 2 million trees by the turn of the century,
he said.
   In his speech, Bush mentioned that the White House grounds have
an elm planted by John Quincy Adams, Southern magnolias brought
Andrew Jackson and oaks planted by Dwight D. Eisenhower.
   He didn't mention that for his seal Adams used the Latin words,
``Alteri seculo,'' taken from the phrase: ``He plants trees to
benefit another generation.''

<HEAD>Amtrak Pleads Innocent in Sewage-Dumping Charge</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PALATKA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amtrak pleaded innocent Monday, via
facsimile machine, to charges that it illegally flushes
passenger-car toilets and sewage tanks when its trains cross Florida
waterways, where fishermen have been sprayed.
   The transmission of the pleas to Circuit Judge Robert Perry
quickly ended an arraignment, said Assistant State Attorney Paul
Meredith. The judge scheduled a Nov. 2 hearing for pre-trial motions.
   Amtrak has threatened to halt service in Florida.
   The plea was entered after Amtrak earlier rejected a settlement
offer from State Attorney John Tanner, who promised to drop three
charges of commercial dumping if Amtrak would stop all flushing
while its trains cross trestles over creeks and rivers in his
judicial district.
   Amtrak, which has been dumping along its tracks under a federal
law dating back more than a century, said it can't do that because
it would set a precedent.
   The federal law permits the railway to flush toilets along its
right-of-way, and federal law overrides state and local regulations,
Amtrak contends.
   Amtrak has also come under fire in several Western states for its
sanitary habits, but Amtrak spokesman Clifford Black said this is
the first complaint filed in a criminal court.
   Amtrak had threatened to suspend service in Florida if Tanner
pressed his case, but Tanner said Amtrak was bluffing.
   ``We hope we won't have to suspend service to Florida,'' said
Amtrak spokeswoman Sue Martin in Washington, D.C. ``But we are
between a rock and a hard place and we certainly do not want to
continue this public embarrassment. We do not want to be accused of
committing a felony every day.''
   Tanner filed the misdemeanor counts after getting complaints from
people who said they were sprayed with raw sewage while fishing
beneath trestles in the Palatka area of northeastern Florida. Tanner
said the charges would be dropped if Amtrak agreed to stop dumping
over Rice Creek, a tributary of the St. Johns River, and in the
river itself.
   Black said agreeing to Tanner's conditions would have made Amtrak
a target for similar demands from anyone else wanting to stop
dumping in any body of water in Florida.
   Amtrak's passenger cars dispose of sewage either by dumping
directly onto the tracks when toilets are flushed or by spraying the
contents of 30-gallon holding tanks along the tracks when the trains
are traveling at least 35 mph.
   The company hopes eventually to replace much of its fleet with
cars that would have holding tanks for all toilets. Black said it
would cost $147 million to install those tanks on the current fleet.

<TEXT>
   State and local governments must form
partnerships with private industry if the United States is to regain
its position as a leader in the global economy, southern governors
were told Monday.
   Top industry representatives told the Southern Governors'
Association that a skilled work force, fair treatment by government
regulators and a cooperative spirit between government and business
are key to improving the United States' position in the industrial
world.
   The governors must work harder to keep plants from relocating to
other countries, said Edgar S. Woolard, chairman and chief executive
of Wilmington-based Du Pont Co.
   ``The fastest economic growth over the next 10 years will be
outside the United States,'' Woolard said, adding that companies
``must locate in the spot where we can best serve customers.''
   The education of America's future workers also preoccupied
members of the association _ which represents 17 states, Puerto Rico
and the U.S. Virgin Islands _ on the first day of their three-day
annual meeting.
   ``From our perspective, we need people with basic skills,''
Woolard said. He said industry should cooperate with government to
help identify skills that are expected to be in demand, and help
provide needed training programs.
   Ira Magaziner, an author and international corporate consultant,
said that in addition to improving education, states should support
research and development activities that benefit industry.
   ``We have to take drastic steps ... and think very boldly about
the future ... to make us competitive again,'' Magaziner said.
   Peter H. Mills, chief administrative officer of Sematech, a
superconductor research company in Austin, Texas, cautioned the
governors not to court businesses indiscriminately.
   ``You must understand the needs of the company. ... You must
understand the competition in a global perspective,'' Mills said.
``States should not be encouraged to pursue every economic
development advantage that comes down the street,'' but instead
concentrate on what the state needs and has to offer.
   Magaziner added that states ought to look beyond nailing down an
initial agreement for a new business to open.
   In other countries, government officials continue negotiating
with new businesses ``to get them to deepen what they are doing
there. ... European companies are used to that kind of dialogue and
probably would be open to that.''
   Premier David Peterson of Ontario, Canada, held a breakfast
meeting with some of the governors, and told them he was initially
opposed to the U.S.-Canadian free trade agreement signed in January.
   Peterson said that although he now supports it, strength of the
new settlement is untested. ``We don't know how it's going to shake
down,'' he said.
   He said Ontario did about $84 billion in trade with the Great
Lakes Region last year, compared to $18 billion with the South.
Ontario now has an office in Atlanta and officials there hope to
increase trade with the Southern states.

<BYLINE>Indian Troop Withdrawal: Peace Initiative or Prelude to a Bloodbath?
^By PATRICK CRUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some officials said Monday that India's
decision to withdraw its troops from Sri Lanka could help end ethnic
violence that has killed 16,000 people. But others feared it might
result in a bloodbath.
   According to an agreement signed Monday in Colombo, India will
withdraw its 42,000 peacekeeping troops from the island by the end
of the year, breaking a three-month diplomatic deadlock between the
two South Asian neighbors.
   The troops, stationed in Sri Lanka to enforce a 1987 peace
accord, also will begin observing a unilateral cease-fire in their
campaign against Tamil militants at 6 a.m. Wednesday, the agreement
said.
   In New Delhi, a Foreign Ministry spokesman was optimistic the
agreement would work because it ``accommodated each other's
interests and concerns.''
   A leader of the moderate Sinhalese Liberal Party welcomed the
agreement as a step toward ending spiraling violence. ``It sounds
like at last we might see an end to the violence because this is a
starting point to get all forces into the democratic process,'' said
Chanaka Amaratunga.
   The agreement also said the Sri Lankan army commander and the
commanding officer of the Indian troops will monitor possible
cease-fire violations and report them to Sri Lankan President
Ranasinghe Premadasa.
   A moderate Tamil leader feared the withdrawal of Indian troops
would lead to a security vacuum and cause a bloodbath.
   ``Will there be a professional police force capable of commanding
the confidence of all people in the North and East _ because only
such a force can prevent a bloodbath scenario once the Indian troops
leave,'' said the leader, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   India deployed more than 50,000 troops to Sri Lanka in July 1987
to supervise a peace accord that offered Tamil rebels limited
autonomy if they laid down their weapons and ended their campaign
for an independent homeland in the northern and eastern provinces of
the island nation.
   But the largest and most militant rebel group, the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam, rejected the accord because it did not
fulfill their expectations and turned their guns against Indian
troops.
   The presence of Indian troops also caused a bloody backlash by
Sinhalese militants. Extremists of the Sinhalese People's Liberation
Front opposed the government for signing the accord that offered too
many concessions to the Tamils. They also resented the presence of
Indian troops on the island as a threat to national sovereignty.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindu, form 18 percent of the country's 16
million people and claim they are discriminated against in jobs and
education by members of the Sinhalese community, who are mostly
Buddhist and comprise 75 percent of the population, dominating the
government and military.
   At least 11,000 people, including 1,000 Indian troops, have been
killed since the Tamil insurgency started in 1983. Another 5,000
have died in the Sinhalese backlash.
   In an effort to curb ethnic violence that has ripped across the
once-idyllic, palm-fringed Indian Ocean island, Premadasa demanded
Indian troops leave by July 29, the second anniversary of the
signing of the Indo-Sri Lankan peace accord. But Indian Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi refused, saying a hasty withdrawal could lead
to greater bloodshed.
   India made a token withdrawal on July 29 and then made gradual
pullouts. It finalized a schedule for withdrawal of the remaining
troops at the meeting of non-aligned nations earlier this month in
Yugoslavia.
   A peace committee consisting of members of political and ethnic
groups in the northeastern province will be formed to settle local
administrative issues under Monday's agreement.
   A security coordination group also will be set up to ensure law
and order in the northeastern province. It will include the Sri
Lankan minister of state for defense, the defense secretary, and the
commander of the Indian peacekeeping troops.

<TEXT>
   Israel's defense minister told President
Hosni Mubarak Monday that Israel would accept an Egyptian-sponsored
dialogue with Palestinians, but the two leaders disagreed on the
composition of the Arab delegation.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Mubarak aired their
disagreement publicly after meeting in Cairo for more than three
hours.
   At a news conference, Rabin said Israel advocated negotiations
only with Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip, occupied
by Israel since 1967. At a separate news conference, Mubarak
insisted that Palestinians from outside the territories be included
as well.
   But both leaders voiced cautious optimism about the current
Israeli-Egyptian exchanges on a scenario for overall settlement of
the Palestinian problem, which has kept the Middle East in turmoil
for four decades.
   They said their two countries will have further high-level talks.
   Rabin, a senior member of Israel's center-left Labor Party, flew
in for a seven-hour stay and was driven directly to Mubarak's
office. The two met alone for 2{ hours, then called in aides.
   Both said they expected Israel to present its final position next
month on Mubarak's two-pronged peace proposal.
   One segment of Mubarak's plan calls for a preliminary
Israeli-Palestinian dialogue in Cairo to discuss a Palestinian
election plan advanced by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
   According to Shamir's plan, Palestinians in the West Bank and
Gaza would vote to choose delegates to negotiate with Israel on
interim autonomy.
   Mubarak also has presented a 10-point memorandum, which basically
attaches conditions to Shamir's plan that would make it acceptable
to the Palestinians.
   Points of that document include Israel's acceptance of the
principle of trading land for peace, and giving the vote to
Palestinians in Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem.
   Those points have split Israel's coalition government. Both ideas
are anathema to Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc but are accepted by
the Labor Party headed by Finance Minister Shimon Peres, who says
they are a way to get the peace process moving.
   Israel radio quoted Shamir on as saying Monday that if Labor
sticks to its support of Mubarak's initiative, ``It will lead to a
break in the government.''
   Rabin's visit was sanctioned by Israel's Cabinet, and Mubarak
emphasized he believed that Rabin was acting as a representative of
his government _ not merely a Labor politician.
   Rabin said upon returning to Israel, however, that since the
Cabinet had not formed an official response to Egypt's plan, he
could offer Mubarak only his own understanding of the Israeli
position.
   ``Because there is no government decision, I could only clarify
to him the government's peace plan, where I see accepted things .. .
and where we still disagree,'' Rabin told a news conference at Ben
Gurion airport.
   Israeli newspapers quoted Shamir as saying any deviation by Rabin
from the Israeli peace plan would be ``only an expression of
personal opinion.''
   One issue not mentioned by the leaders was the role of the
Palestine Liberation Organization. The PLO has rejected Israel's
plan mainly because it does not refer to the formation of an
independent Palestinian state. Israel officially refuses to talk to
the PLO, which it views as a terror group.
   The PLO also objects to the demand by Likud that the Arab
uprising in the occupied lands, which began in Dec. 1987, end before
any talks begin.
   Summing up his talks with Mubarak, Rabin said he told the
president that Israel:
   _Appreciated Mubarak's desire to convene a meeting between
Israelis and Palestinians.
   _Agreed that the invitations to such a meeting would be made by
Egypt.
   _Agreed that the Palestinian side to the talks would be announced
by Egypt.
   But Rabin spoke of ``certain problems that we have to discuss
among ourselves (in Israel) like the composition'' of a Palestinian
delegation.
   He said twice that Israel wanted Palestinians from the West Bank
and Gaza, clearly implying it opposed Palestinians from outside.
   Mubarak dissented.
   ``My opinion is we should not neglect those who are outside,''
the president said.
   He said he planned to hold separate talks in the United States
with Peres and Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, a leader in Likud.
   Mubarak will be in the United States in late September and early
October for talks with President Bush and to address the U.N.
General Assembly.
   The president termed his talks with Rabin ``very fruitful and
very logical.''
   Mubarak reiterated his long-standing refusal to meet with Shamir
until enough progress is made and ``something big'' can emerge from
a summit _ such as final agreement on the Israeli-Palestinian
dialogue.
   After the talks, Rabin drove to the tomb of President Anwar
Sadat, whose historic 1977 journey to Jerusalem began the process
that led two years later to Egypt's peace treaty with Israel _ the
only one between an Arab country and the Jewish state.

   Debbye Turner said Monday that she hopes to use
her new Miss America title to get ahead in her chosen field:
veterinary medicine.
   ``I'll milk it for all it's worth,'' joked the University of
Missouri-Columbia Veterinary School senior. ``If being Miss America
can get me into an intern program, I'll certainly use it.''
   Miss Turner, who was crowned Saturday night, insisted she's not
angling for a modeling or movie career. But she added that she's
``not a fortune teller'' and said she's prepared to ``accept
anything that life wants to hand me.''
   At her first New York appearance, Miss Turner said she would seek
to motivate youth to reach for lofty goals and resist peer pressure.
In that vein, she will ``tell them about my experiences growing up,
tell them about some of the mistakes that I've made and how I think
that they can make their life a little easier by setting some goals
and being determined.''
   What were some of her mistakes?
   ``Not keeping up with piano lessons, not being more diligent in
high school in my studies.''
   Miss Turner confided that although she was an ``A'' student, ``I
had no study skills. ... I had to develop my skills at veterinary
school, which is a bad place to do it.''
   A day after becoming the third black woman to wear the crown,
Miss Turner said that her race ``is the very least of who I am. I
had nothing to do with it, and that's not landmark. I just came that
way.''
   When told of a black person who was disappointed with that
statement, Miss Turner said she was sorry _ then reiterated her
feelings.
   ``Certainly, I've gained and grown from the experiences that I've
had to confront as being an ethnic minority in this country,'' she
said.
   ``However, I grew up in the South; I'm a veterinary student; I'm
hard working; I'm self-motivated; I'm a Christian. And those are all
a part of who I am,'' she said. ``I'm certainly proud of who I am _
I'm not ashamed of it at all _ but I don't think I'm limited to
being black.''
   Asked how to improve race relations, she said, ``Start teaching,
from a very young age, that merit is based upon substance on the
inside and not upon the decoration on the outside.''
   After the news conference, she posed with a hot dog from vendor
Gamal Ahmed, who came here from Egypt two years ago.
   ``What's Miss America?'' said the befuddled vendor as
photographers nudged him aside.
   On Tuesday, Miss Turner's 24th birthday, she will pose for
official portraits, appear with Donald Trump and possibly appear on
the David Letterman show.

<TEXT>
   Nearly 750 more refugees arrived
in West Germany, officials said Monday, while others made desperate
escape attempts after they were reportedly harassed by Czechoslovak
and East German officials.
   An East German man taking part in the exodus to West Germany
drowned while swimming across the Danube River from Czechoslovakia
to Hungary, refugee workers said Monday. He was forced to swim
because he had no travel documents.
   A Czechoslovak man on Monday managed to cross his Communist
homeland's border to West Germany on a homemade motorized hang
glider.
   The most direct route for East Germans seeking to take advantage
of Hungary's free passage to Austria is through Czechoslovakia,
between East Germany and Hungary.
   The 750 new refugees who arrived in Bavaria early Monday brings
the total to more than 16,000 that have arrived since Hungary opened
its border to the West one week ago. After leaving Hungary, the
refugees cross Austria and enter West Germany, where they receive
automatic citizenship and help settling.
   Hungary, which also has adopted economic and political reforms,
has come under attack from hard-line East bloc allies for allowing
the exodus of East Germans. But Western politicians have welcomed
the moves.
   Western officials on Monday pledged support for Hungary.
   The Commerce Department announced that the United States and
Hungary will open negotiations on an agreement to give the Communist
country permanent most-favored nation trade status and other trade
and investment opportunities.
   Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher said in Budapest that the
proposals are part of a ``comprehensive business and economic
agreement'' that includes a $25 million fund to help create private
business.
   At a separate news conference, Frans Andriessen, a top foreign
affairs official of the 12-member European Economic Community, said
he had pledged to do ``all that's possible'' to support Hungary
economically.
   East German refugees arriving in Budapest reported East German
and Czechoslovak authorities were trying to prevent many from
crossing into Hungary if they were suspected of wanting to emigrate
to the West.
   Wolfgang Warner, the head of the West German charity organization
helping East Germans, said Monday that it was clear that Prague and
East Berlin were working ``hand in hand'' to stem the flow of East
Germans using Hungary's open door to the West.
   Wagner said the East German man who drowned Sunday in the Danube
tried to escape because he did not have travel permits for Hungary.
   The total number of East Germans who have used Hungary for
passage to freedom since early summer is thought to exceed 25,000.
Many fled illegally after Hungary removed some border fortifications
with Austria in May.
   The number of East Germans taking refuge in the West German
Embassy in Warsaw, Poland, swelled over the weekend to 110, West
German Foreign Ministry spokesman Juergen Chrobog told reporters in
Bonn. ``The situation is untenable,'' Chrobog said. ``It cannot go
on like this.''
   Wladyslaw Klaczynski, a spokesman in the Polish Foreign Ministry,
said he had no information Monday on the situation.

   The chairman of a House subcommittee defended
the Navy's new $1.2 billion destroyer Monday, calling another
lawmaker's claims that the ship is a ``procurement nightmare'' a
disservice to the Navy and all involved.
   Rep. Charles E. Bennett, chairman of the House Armed Services
subcommittee on seapower and strategic and critical materials, said
that on-site inspections by the panel, testimony and briefings show
that work on the DDG-51 destroyer ``is going as well as any in
recent history.''
   ``The design concept is sound, drawings have been produced in a
timely manner and the ship will be delivered to the Navy in a
reasonable amount of time,'' the Florida Democrat said.
   The ship, named the Arleigh Burke for the World War II naval hero
and former chief of naval operations, was launched Saturday in Bath,
Maine.
   Bennett's comments about the guided-missile destroyer came in a
two-page letter to Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House
Energy and Commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations.
   Dingell, in a letter last week to Navy Secretary H. Lawrence
Garrett III, charged that construction of the destroyer has been
marked by cost overruns and schedule delays. He said a preliminary
report by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, showed that the destroyer is 18 months behind schedule and
only 38 percent complete.
   ``The acquisition of the DDG-51 has turned into a procurement
nightmare,'' Dingell said.
   Bennett, in his letter, told Dingell that ``while it is a truism
that there is always room for improvement, to state that the
construction on DDG-51 is a `procurement nightmare' does a
significant disservice to this committee, the Navy and its personnel
and contractors.''
   Bennett said cost overruns and change orders are common in the
production of any new major ship and, in fact, shipbuilding
contracts expect increases in cost and change orders because of the
long construction time and uncertainties about the design.

<HEAD>Government Official Says Mandela Could Be Freed Within Weeks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress
leader, could be freed within weeks, a South African Cabinet
minister said in a British radio interview on Monday.
   But Desmond Tutu, the Anglican archbishop of Cape Town and a
leading anti-apartheid campaigner, said it would be ``disastrous''
to release Mandela without lifting state of emergency regulations
that restrict black political activity in South Africa.
   The South African minister for constitutional development, Gerrit
Viljoen, said the release of Mandela and ``other people who have
been convicted of security offenses is a matter very high on the
agenda of the government.''
   Asked if Mandela's release could be within weeks, Viljoen said,
``I think it could.''
   Speculation that Mandela soon will be freed grew after the
re-election victory this month of the whites-only National Party
under a new leader, F.W. de Klerk, who has promised reforms. Under
apartheid, the country's black majority does not have the vote.
   Mandela, 71, was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1964 after his
conviction of plotting sabotage.
   Viljoen, interviewed from South Africa by British Broadcasting
Corp.'s radio, said of Mandela's release, ``the fewer conditions
that are involved the better.''
   He did not repeat the key condition laid down by the previous
South African president, P.W. Botha, that Mandela first renounce
violence. But Viljoen added, ``Mr. Mandela has expressed himself in
terms which clearly indicate his preference for a peacefully
negotiated solution.''
   Tutu, also speaking in a telephone interview, said de Klerk's
government first would need to show good faith by lifting the state
of emergency and legalizing banned black movements.
   ``It is no use releasing Mr. Mandela and other political
prisoners into a state of emergency situation,'' said Tutu. ``It
would actually be quite, quite disastrous.''
   He added that if Mandela were released he would have to be
completely free and not, for example, restricted to Soweto, the
black township outside Johannesburg.
   He added that the state of emergency that includes bans on mass
rallies, ``has proved totally ineffective ... it has not done what
the government hoped it would do which is knock the stuffing out of
black opposition.''

<HEAD>NBC Study Finds College Students Like TV</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   NBC, in what may not prove a surprise, asserted
Monday that college students like television.
   The network also said college students are undercounted in the
Nielsen ratings and would have a substantial impact in the Nielsens
were they included in national audience estimates.
   NBC's conclusions were based on a telephone survey last spring of
1,014 students ages 18-24 at 50 four-year colleges and universities
nationwide.
   Among other things, the study found that 96 percent of the
students it polled watch TV; they watch it 1.8 hours a day compared
to the national viewing average of nearly seven hours; more males
watch late-night TV than females, and the opposite is true for
daytime soap operas.
   NBC's study was the latest in recent network efforts to study
viewing audiences that traditionally haven't been included in the
national Nielsen audience estimates.
   The national Nielsens only count viewers in homes, not in college
dorms, hotel rooms, and such places as sports bars.
   During the November ratings ``sweeps'' period, Nielsen Media
Research, in a study commissioned by NBC, ABC and cable's ESPN, will
conduct a survey of such uncounted viewers, using diaries given to
6,000 people, according to Richard Montesano, an ABC research vice
president.
   The studies come at a time when the networks, losing audiences to
cable, videocassette recorders and independent stations, are seeking
ways to include hitherto uncounted TV viewers in national estimates
_ or at least convince advertisers that these viewers should be
considered in their television time-buying plans.
   NBC, whose spring survey focused only on college students,
estimated that there are about 13 million college students _ 8.5
million in the 18-to-24 age range _ with spending power of $20
billion annually.
   The NBC study, by Survey Design and Analysis of Ann Arbor, Mich.,
found that 83 percent of those it polled considered commercials a
fair exchange for TV entertainment. It also found that 60 percent of
the males polled watch late-night TV entertainment, as did 39
percent of the women polled.
   But 63 percent of the women students polled said they watched
daytime TV, compared with only 29 percent of the men.
   As with the general public, television was the main source of
news for the students polled; 43 percent said they got most of their
news from television, compared to 27 percent who said they got it
from newspapers.
   They tended to trust TV news more, too. When asked which medium
they would believe in the case of conflicting stories about a news
event, 53 percent said television, while 36 percent said newspapers.
   In entertainment matters, NBC's survey showed six NBC programs
among the 10 television shows most favored by the college students
polled, with ``The Cosby Show'' at the top of the list and ``Late
Night With David Letterman'' fifth.
   The Letterman show was the only late-night program in the Top 10
list, which also included three ABC shows _ ``thirtysomething,''
``Growing Pains'' and ``Wonder Years.'' CBS' durable ``Knots
Landing'' was at the bottom of the list.

   President Bush, urging a ``new greening of
America,'' proposed a national tree-planting campaign Monday as a
low-cost part of his national clean-air strategy.
   He also said he would order special environmental training for
Peace Corps representatives abroad, ``to stop pollution before it
starts, and ensure that economic development and environmental
stewardship go hand-in-hand.''
   ``Our Peace Corps volunteers are going to help spread the word in
the developing world,'' Bush told an outdoor crowd in front of
Montana's copper-domed capitol at his second stop on a Western trip
honoring three states that are marking 100-year anniversaries.
   He said that, beginning next year, Peace Corps members would be
trained by the Environmental Protection Agency to deal with ``a full
range of environmental challenges,'' including waste disposal, water
pollution prevention, pesticide management and reforestation.
   Earlier, Bush suggested at a similar ceremony in Sioux Falls,
S.D., that trees be planted alongside the nation's interstate
highway system as part of a national volunteer tree-planting program.
   Referring to trees as ``the oldest, cheapest and most-efficient
air purifier on earth,'' Bush declared: ``We need to reforest this
bountiful earth.''
   Bush planted trees at ceremonies in Helena and in Sioux Falls,
and also was to participate in a similar centennial observation in
Spokane, Wash., on Tuesday.
   In a separate address to a regional conference of state
legislators in Helena, Bush said the nation's ``teaching and
learning environment'' also needs protection.
   Speaking of the two-day education summit he is convening next
week in Charlottesville, Va., Bush said, ``the plain truth is that
our educational system is not making the grade.''
   He told state lawmakers from Wyoming, Nebraska, North Dakota and
South Dakota that ``you appropriate the money. You make programs
possible. And you often are experts on education.''
   Bush also put in a pitch for his crime and anti-drug programs,
saying ``we need the states to toughen their laws: Mandatory time
for weapons offenders, no plea-bargaining on guns, the death penalty
for heinous drug crimes, and more police, prosecutors and prisons.''
   Earlier, he told a Sioux Falls audience of several thousand
gathered in the municipal arena, ``You in South Dakota know what it
takes to plant a tree. It doesn't take a federal program. It doesn't
take a new bureaucracy. And it sure doesn't take some fancy new
study. What it takes is a shovel.''
   ``Nature has powerful rejuvenative forces but we need to help
them along,'' he added.
   The Bush administration was expected to make reforestation a
major element of its environmental policy, matching an international
movement to preserve the world's rain forests.
   By converting carbon dioxide to oxygen, trees can help clean the
air as well as counter the so-called ``greenhouse effect,'' in which
an overabundance of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere speeds global
warming.
   Bush noted that his first effort at planting a tree in a
centennial state had been jinxed _ an elm tree he planted in
neighboring North Dakota last April.
   The elm, transplanted from the White House lawn, turned out to be
infected with several tiny larvae of the gypsy moth _ a leaf-eating
insect that has devastated elms in many Eastern and some Western
states.
   ``So far, I'm having about as much luck planting as I did
fishing,'' Bush quipped.
   The larvae were removed from the North Dakota tree _ a descendant
of one planted by President John Quincy Adams _ and the tree was
sprayed with insecticide.
   ``In the middle of this century, we built the interstate highway
system, the greatest ground transportation network since Rome,''
Bush said. ``Now let's make these corridors beautiful, quieter,
greener _ and cleaner.''
   ``It's not enough to stop dirtying the air. We've got to clean it
up,'' Bush told his audience.
   ``Of course, reforestation is only one part of our comprehensive
and sometimes highly technical proposals to clean up America's air.
But trees possess a value no high-tech solution will ever match.
...''
   ``Trees can reduce the heat of a summer's day, quiet a highway's
noise, feed the hungry, provide shelter from the wind and warmth in
the winter.''
   In comments that seemed to come full circle from Ronald Reagan's
1980 observation that trees are a major cause of air pollution, Bush
told his audience ``every tree is a compact between generations.''
   Reagan was roundly criticized during the 1980 presidential
campaign when he said that most atmospheric contamination comes from
natural rather than manmade processes, and that trees are
responsible for 93 percent of the nitrogen oxides in the atmosphere.
Environmentalists said Reagan was confused about nitrous oxide,
which comes from decaying plant matter and is not harmful, and
nitrogen oxide, which is emitted by coal plants and is a pollutant.
   Bush noted that the federal government had planted 340,000 acres
of new trees last year. But he said this was a relatively small
amount and ``the real solution is at the grassroots level.''

   Wrangling between Israel's coalition partners
grew hotter Monday over Egypt's peace plan. Leaders of both the
right-wing Likud bloc and left-leaning Labor Party said the rift
could turn into a government crisis.
   The infighting came as Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin met in
Cairo with President Hosni Mubarak on the Egyptian leader's call for
Israel to accept the U.S.-backed formula of trading occupied land
for peace.
   Rabin's Labor Party has accepted Mubarak's plan in principle and
is pressing the government to agree to his offer to arrange an
Israeli-Palestinian meeting in Cairo. Likud Cabinet ministers have
rejected the 10-point Egyptian plan.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, leader of Likud, said on Israel
radio that in a government of the two divergent parties, ``there is
always the danger of strong differences of opinion which turn into a
crisis.''
   ``I personally would like to see the coalition remain, but I must
say that unity ... cannot be equal to any price.''
   On Israel television, Industry Minister Ariel Sharon defended
Likud's stand of never giving up land, even in exchange for peace.
   ``The question is not always what are the Jews prepared to give,
but should also be what are the Arabs prepared to give in exchange
for peace,'' he said.
   Rabin noted the differences between the two sides upon return
from Cairo but said he hoped they could reach a compromise on
Mubarak's proposals.
   ``I hope very much that the majority of the government members
can make a decision on this and that the unity of the coalition
government can be preserved,'' he told reporters at Ben-Gurion
airport.
   Israel's own peace plan already has led to one crisis in the
Cabinet formed last December. In July, Shamir's party sought to
toughen the plan and Labor threatened to pull out of the government.
   Labor withdrew its threat when Shamir said he would not accept
demands from Likud hard-liners to include the party's tough stand in
the formal plan.
   The government peace initiative, approved in May, calls for
Palestinian elections leading to negotiations between Israel and
representatives of the West Bank and Gaza Strip on limited autonomy
in the occupied territories.
   After Palestinians rejected the plan, Mubarak called for
supplementing it, basing the negotiations on the land-for-peace
principle and letting the 140,000 Arabs in Israeli-annexed east
Jerusalem vote in the Palestinian elections.
   Likud ministers issued a statement Sunday saying the government
``must not accept any additions or changes'' to the government peace
plan.
   In contrast, Labor leaders have said the Egyptian plan could help
bridge the gap between Israelis and Palestinians.
   ``The subject is how to advance the peace process and not how to
bring about the collapse of the government,'' Labor leader and
Finance Minister Shimon Peres said on Israel radio.
   Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip from
Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.

<HEAD>Researchers Says Altered Cells Appear To Shrink Cancer Tumors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers using the first approved transfer
of a foreign gene into humans said Monday that altered
cancer-fighting cells have shrunk tumors in one patient and that
cells from a single injection continue to work for at least 19 days.
   Dr. Steven A. Rosenberg, a National Cancer Institute researcher,
said that five patients, all terminally ill with a cancer called
maglignant melanoma, have been treated with gene-modified cells, but
he could report on only one patient, a 26-year-old woman.
   That patient, he said, suffers from melanoma that had formed
tumors throughout her body, including the lungs, the skin and the
soft palate of the mouth.
   In July, she received an infusion of a type of cancer-fighting
cell called gene-modified tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Rosenberg
said later tests showed that the tumor in her mouth had
``regressed,'' or shrunk, by about 90 percent.
   The lymphocytes used in the study are natural cancer-fighting
cells that had been cultured from cells withdrawn from the woman's
tumors. Rosenberg and his colleagues have developed a technique
wherein tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, or TIL cells, are cultured
in the laboratory in interleukin-2, a protein that promotes
lymphocyte growth. When the cells multiply to 200 billion, they are
then reinjected into the patient's blood stream as an army of cancer
fighters.
   Rosenberg reported last year that this technique resulted in a 50
percent tumor reduction in at least 60 percent of the treated
patients.
   Cells used in the latest study were further manipulated so that
the researchers could trace the movement of the TIL cells in the
patients' bodies. To mark the TILs, the researchers inserted into
the cells a neomycin-resistant gene. The gene, manipulated through
the use of a mouse leukemia retrovirus _ a virus that can move genes
from one type of cell to another _ is the first foreign, or
non-human, gene to be approved for use in patient therapy.
   Rosenberg said that in the female patient, the researchers were
able to recover some of the marked cells from several sites, proving
that the cancer-fighting cells did migrate to the tumors. He said
the study also showed that the cells lived for at least 19 days, and
that follow-up studies may show that the cells live even longer.
   Additionally, Rosenberg said that there have been ``no side
effects to the introduced cells in any patient.''
   He called the results ``extremely preliminary.''
   All five patients who have received the gene-modified
cancer-fighting cells are still alive, he said. The therapy will be
attempted soon on another five patients.
   Eventually, Rosenberg said, the gene-manipulation technique may
be used to introduce into the cancer-fighting cell a gene for
another type of lymphocyte, thus making the TIL cell an even
stronger cancer-fighter.
   Rosenberg made the comments at a news conference that followed a
report to a meeting Monday of the National Cancer Advisory Board, a
group appointed by the president to monitor federal cancer research.

<HEAD>Couple Convicted of Largest Medicaid Fraud Ever Indicted Again</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A couple who fled after the husband was convicted
in the nation's largest Medicaid fraud case were indicted for bail
jumping. The husband was recaptured after the case was featured on
national televison.
   Sheldon Weinberg, 64, serving a seven- to 21-year sentence at
Attica state prison, was indicted by a state grand jury on one count
of bail jumping, said Deputy Attorney General Edward J. Kuriansky.
   Roslyn Weinberg, 61, of Batavia, also was charged with bail
jumping and two lesser counts in the indictment unsealed Monday for
allegedly helping her husband flee to Arizona.
   Both pleaded innocent at arraignment before state court Judge
Ruth Moskowitz. Mrs. Weinberg was released in her own recognizance.
   Weinberg and his two sons were convicted Nov. 30 of defrauding
the Medicaid program of $16 million, the largest such theft in the
22-year history of the program. While free on $250,000 bail, he and
his wife disappeared in January, days before he was to be sentenced.
   Weinberg was recaptured in Scottsdale, Ariz., on May 17, just
hours after his case was described on the NBC-TV program, ``Unsolved
Mysteries.'' Mrs. Weinberg flew back to New York three days later
and was met at the airport by state investigators, who confiscated
jewelry and $105,000 in cash.
   Kuriansky said Weinberg and his sons falsely billed Medicaid by
submitting reimbursement claims for about 400,000 phony patients at
their Bed-Stuy Health Care Corp. in Brooklyn.

<HEAD>Senate Leader Says Bush Reacting Slowly to Eastern European Change</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration has reacted timidly to
the rush of change in Eastern Europe and should shift gears and
actively support the forces of democratic change in the communist
empire, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell said Monday.
   The Maine Democrat called on President Bush to support the entry
of communist nations into Western economic institutions, ``once
their internal reforms merit such participation.''
   ``The president should clearly state that he will let these
countries into the economic game if they will play by the rules,''
Mitchell told the Senate.
   He cited reform movements under way in Poland and Hungary and
said they are clear signs of the failure of communism as a viable
economic and political ideology.
   ``Now is the time for the United States to encourage and
capitalize upon the changes we have sought for so long,'' Mitchell
said.
   ``The administration's timidity in the face of these
opportunities is puzzling and dismaying,'' he said. ``Instead of
encouragement and engagement, the administration has adopted an
almost passive stance.''
   ``President Bush must reach beyond the status quo thinking that
appears to dominate administration thinking,'' Mitchell said. ``He
must cast aside ambivalence and hesitation and timidity and adopt a
more energetic and engaged policy toward the Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe.''
   The Bush administration, Mitchell said, ``seems almost nostalgic
about the Cold War and the rigid superpower relationships that
divided the world into two hostile and isolated camps for 40 years.''
   ``The possibility of our relations with the Soviet Union becoming
more complex and cooperative should be welcomed, not feared,'' he
said.
   The new situation will create new hazards and uncertainties, he
said.
   ``But there is no question in my mind that the greatest risk is
the failure of continued progress toward democratization and a
reversion to the Cold War policies of the past.
   ``The United States should not be afraid of its own success,''
Mitchell said. ``The administration should actively try to shape the
final outcome of the process of change we have demanded for so many
years.
   ``While the president has called for a policy of `beyond
containment,' he has failed to explain or adopt it,'' he said.
   ``There is a pressing need for the president to articulate his
vision of where he hopes this transformation will lead and devise an
American strategy to help achieve that result,'' Mitchell said.

   When shoppers say ``charge it,'' a state
lawmaker wants them to say ``I Love New York'' at the same time.
   An ``I Love New York'' credit card could raise money for the
state, boost state pride and promote tourism, says Assemblyman Robin
Schimminger, who is promoting the idea.
   The card would work in the same way any major credit card
operates and would have competitive interest rates. But the cards
would be embossed with different tourist attractions, said
Schimminger.
   For example, a card issued in Niagara Falls would have a picture
of the famous cascade and a card issued in New York City would have
the Empire State Building, Schimminger said.
   ``This is a way to raise millions of dollars in revenue without
hiking taxes,'' he said Monday. ``It also helps promote community
spirit and give consumers an opportunity to play a part in tourism
and cultural development.''
   Schimminger said Montana is promoting such a card and expects to
raise more than $12 million in revenues. He said New York state
could raise much more because its population is 20 times greater.
   Under the proposal, the state Department of Economic Development
would establish a state-affiliated credit card and contract with
banks to distribute the card.
   The state would get a percentage of an annual card fee and a
small percentage of the value of goods and services charged, while
participating banks would retain a share and get the extra business
the cards generate, Schimminger said.

<HEAD>Fox Scores Ratings Win for Emmy Show; Aaron Spelling Basks in First
Victory</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Fox Broadcasting Co. scored a rare double
at the 41st annual Emmy awards: The telecast brought the fledgling
television network its second-best ratings ever and its first Emmy
statuettes.
   According to preliminary ratings released Monday by Fox, the
nationally televised awards program delivered a rating of 15.4 and a
25 share in 20 top cities. A rating point is equivalent to 904,000
households with television; the share is the percentage of sets in
use.
   The awards show also saw producer Aaron Spelling collect his
first Emmy. Spelling, who has been blasted for such titillating
series as ``Charlie's Angels'' and ``Nightingales,'' won for his CBS
movie ``Day One,'' a look at the personal and scientific struggles
behind the building of the first atomic bomb.
   ``I'd never thought I'd be so ostentatious and pretentious as to
have an Emmy sitting on the desk. ... I'm going to take it home
tonight and show the family,'' Spelling said in a rare phone
interview from his office Monday.
   Spelling said his Emmy, won in a tie with ``Roe vs. Wade'' for
best drama special, probably wouldn't change his reputation.
   ``You always hear `Charlie's Angels' or `Love Boat.' So I don't
know if this is going to change anything,'' he said.
   Spelling said he won't abandon his commitment to producing
mass-appeal programming just to capture awards.
   ``We have a responsibility to the people in this company to keep
them working,'' he said.
   In addition to ``Day One,'' top winners at this year's Emmys were
the sometimes opinionated programs ``Roe vs. Wade'' and ``War and
Remembrance.''
   ``Roe vs. Wade,'' a chronicle of the fight for legalized
abortion, was subject to 20 network-mandated script rewrites and
targeted by advocacy groups who believed the show was biased toward
the pro-choice movement.
   Advertiser defections cost NBC about $1 million on the movie.
   ``It's certainly a sweet victory,'' Anthony Masucci, NBC's senior
vice president of miniseries and motion picture for television, said
Monday.
   ``I think we can all be encouraged by'' the Emmy victory, Masucci
said. ``We have to be there and stand up creatively and be counted.
Sometimes you have to say, `To hell with the advertisers who have no
guts.'''
   Sunday's awards ceremony, in which 29 Emmys were handed out with
five minutes to spare in the allotted three hours, gave Fox a
ratings win for the night over CBS, NBC and ABC.
   The Emmy show, broadcast from the Pasadena Civic Auditorium, was
No. 1 in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and other leading
markets.
   Fox's most popular show to date is an episode of the situation
comedy ``Married ... With Children'' earlier this month.
   Equally important to the fourth network was the four Emmys it
collected for its offbeat comedy-variety series ``The Tracey Ullman
Show.'' The program, winner of the best variety, music or comedy
program, was the first Fox show to win one of television's top
prizes.
   ``It's a beginning,'' Barry Diller, chairman of Fox Inc., said in
a backstage interview. ``The first is always the best.''
   ``There was not a single person in the entertainment business who
thought that we were anything but a fool's errand, and that we would
dismally fail,'' he said.

<HEAD>Climatic Warning: Don't Expect Quick or Easy Answers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the federal agency that studies the
air and oceans said Monday that climatic change is likely over the
next century and that there are no quick or easy answers to the
problem.
   ``We can recycle, we can conserve, we can change our lifestyle,
but I believe it is unrealistic'' to expect that population and
energy use can continue to grow without adding human-induced
climatic change to the normal variability of nature, said John
Knauss, head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
   Knauss spoke at a conference on Earth Observation and Global
Change held to discuss research efforts into the causes of the
problem and to seek solutions.
   ``Do not expect easy answers and do not expect quick results. I
expect in the next hundred years and more we will go through a
significant (human) induced climate change,'' said Knauss.
   Climatic change, particularly the so-called Greenhouse warming
effect, have attracted considerable attention in recent years.
   Many scientists believe that carbon dioxide added to the
atmosphere by industry and other human activities could trap heat
from the sun and induce a catastrophic global overheating in the
next century.
   Carbon dioxide, a colorless, odorless gas, has increased by 25
percent over the last 100 years, a change blamed on industrial
processes that produce the chemical and on the destruction of
forests, which remove carbon dioxide from the air.
   Other scientists urge more study, however, wondering if increased
cloudiness or other natural factors might prevent much of the feared
warming.
   Both sides seem to agree that it is too soon to measure any
actual Greenhouse-induced warming because changes in year-to-year
weather normally vary so widely.
   Leonard Fisk of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
told the conference that his agency is launching a major ``Mission
to Planet Earth'' to help answer some of the questions about global
change.
   William F. Harris of the National Science Foundation added that
the organization also is promoting such research, and noted that the
federal Committee on Earth Science recently announced a coordinated
global change research effort by a dozen federal agencies.
   But Knauss admonished listeners not to look for too much too fast.
   He said that what concerns him even more than the threat of
change is that many problems, such as the hole in the protective
ozone layer found over Antarctica, have come as surprises.
   Greenhouse warming was first predicted three decades ago, he
noted, but scientists were surprised by the ozone hole, by recent
reports of increased methane in the air and by a rise in low-level
ozone in rural areas.
   ``My concern in this context is not so much on what their effect
is on global change or the environment, which is real, but that we
did not predict them. It is not much of an exaggeration to say we
almost stumbled over them,'' said Knauss.
   ``I continue to ask myself, `What is it that we're not measuring
that we should be measuring?''' he added.

   A moderate earthquake struck southeastern
Mexico early Monday, according to the National Seismic Service.
   There were no reports of damage or casualties from the quake,
which measured 4.5 on the Richter Scale.
   The Geophysical Institute at Mexico's National Autonomous
University said the quake struck at 5:32 a.m. in the Tehuantepec
isthmus, 460 miles southeast of Mexico City.
   Francisco Celemente, a Red Cross spokesman in Tehuantepec, said
by telephone that the quake was mild and apparently caused no
problems in the area.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. A quake of magnitude 4 can cause moderate damage in
populated areas, and one of magnitude 5 can cause considerable
damage in populated region.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most governors are not expecting a commitment
from President Bush to shell out more federal dollars for the
nation's schools, two leaders of the National Governors' Association
said Monday.
   NGA President Terry E. Branstad of Iowa and New Mexico Gov.
Garrey E. Carruthers, chairman of the Education Commission of the
States, said most of the 50 governors attending the education summit
next week in Charlottesville, Va., will seek mainly to loosen the
stranglehold of federal rules and regulations. Branstad and
Carruthers are Republicans.
   Admitting that money is a sensitive issue that few can agree on,
Branstad said, ``I think there is a feeling that there is
considerable amount of money being spent on education. We want to
spend it as wisely as possible.
   ``We want to make sure that when the federal government does
provide money to states and local school districts it provides
enough flexibility to meet the needs of those local students in the
schools,'' he said.
   Branstad said Bush already has indicated a ``willingness to do
some more in helping `at-risk' kids and programs like the Head Start
programs.''
   ``The main focus of this will not be on additional dollars but
there will be discussions about it,'' Branstad said of the summit.
``There are some governors who do feel strongly about it and other
governors feel that is not a major area.''
   ``I'm not coming to the summit to ask the president of the United
States for more federal dollars,'' Carruthers said. ``I think that's
wrong. I think there's a lot of things that can be done without
asking him for those federal dollars.''
   ``I'm certainly not asking the president to reduce those federal
dollars by any means either,'' added Carruthers. ``But there are
things that can be done with deregulation that can free up money
that can be more properly utilized in the states.''
   For example, Carruthers suggested that Medicaid, the government
health care program for the poor, ``become the principle
responsibility of the federal government and education continue to
be the principle responsibility of the state government.''
   According to Branstad, ``Our hope is that the summit will help us
focus attention of this nation on the critical issues of education
and will help us draw the support of the American people for some of
the most important and pressing challenges that we face.''
   ``The key to the future will be goals that we establish in this
coming year,'' he added.

<DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hurricane Hugo's 125 mph winds
pounded Puerto Rico on Monday after ripping across other islands in
the eastern Caribbean, leaving at least 14 people dead and thousands
homeless.
   The National Weather Service said Hugo, the most powerful storm
to hit the region this decade, slammed into the eastern tip of
Puerto Rico and skirted the northern coast before roaring to the
west-northwest toward the Bahamas.
   Hugo also threatens the Dominican Republic, which shares the
island of Hispaniola with Haiti, and civil defense authorities in
the Dominican Republic before dark Monday declared a state of
emergency.
   Eastern Airlines spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak in Miami said the
carrier flew a special Boeing 727 charter to the Dominican resort of
Puerto Plata Monday and returned to Miami with about 135 vacationers.
   The storm's winds overturned cars and stripped roofs off houses
and office buildings and sent chunks of concrete plunging into
streets in San Juan, where one-third of the U.S. commonwealth's 3.3
million people live. Fifty airplanes were reported destroyed at the
airport in Isla Verde.
   There was widespread damage in San Juan's Condado Beach area, the
site of many of the island's large tourist hotels. Shattered glass,
strips of roofing and overturned trees littered the streets, and few
drivers ventured out in their vehicles.
   Hugo cut power and disrupted international communications to the
island.
   One woman in a San Juan high-rise told radio station WOSO of
watching sections of the city darken as the first high winds and
heavy rains hit San Juan. Widespread power outages also were
reported in the Dominican Republic.
   There were no immediate reports of casualties in Puerto Rico
although one man was electrocuted while trying to remove a
television antenna as he prepared for the storm Sunday.
   Bands of people, mostly youths, looted storm-damaged shops in San
Juan and police patrols were reinforced at the main Post Office,
political party offices and shopping areas.
   In a boutique on the ground floor of the two-story building
housing The Associated Press bureau in San Juan, young looters
defied winds hitting 100mph at the peak of the storm and carried out
armloads of women's clothing.
   The storm blew out the windows in the AP office on a peninsula
between the sea and San Juan harbor, destroying its computers and
office equipment. One staffer said his furniture was blown out the
windows of his apartment on the 20th story of his building.
   At 6 p.m. EDT, Hugo's center was latitude 19.5 degrees north and
longitude 67.0 west, or 90 miles northwest of San Juan, said the
National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla. It said Hugo was
moving 13 mph in a wobbly, west-northwest to northwest direction.
   Maximum sustained winds declined slightly over the day, to 115
mph, and hurricane-force winds extended up to 75 miles from its
center, the forecasters added.
   Meteorologist Jesse Moore at the National Hurricane Center said
it was too early to tell whether Hugo would strike the U.S.
mainland. He said the storm was expected to be off southeastern
Bahamas by Wednesday and ``after that, it's anybody's guess.''
   Five people were reported killed, 80 injured and more than 10,000
homeless Sunday on the French island of Guadeloupe, relief officials
said. Two people were killed in Antigua, according to Beacon Radio
in Anguilla, and there were reports of six deaths in Montserrat.
   Richard Weening of Milwaukee, Wis., chairman of Caribbean
Communications Co., which operates the GEM Radio Network from its
headquarters on Montserrat, said ham operators linked to the network
said the storm killed six people on the British Island and damaged
95 percent of the homes and the hospital.
   Nearly all of Montserrat's 12,000 residents were homeless and
without food or fresh water, said ham radio operator Stuart Haimes
of Queens, N.Y.
   Off St. Thomas, charter boat captain O.B. O'Brian told Miami TV
station WTVJ that many boats and homes had been damaged. ``I'd say
the island is pretty well devastated,'' he said.
   Most of the Virgin Islands' 106,000 residents live on St. Thomas
and St. Croix. On St. Croix, a ham radio operator said the winds
tore off the roofs from up to 75 percent of the homes.
   Officials said stores in the St. Croix town of Christiansted were
heavily damaged, and there were reports of looting. National Guard
Adjutant Gen. Robert Moorehead said 1,000 people were evacuated to
rescue shelters in St. Croix.
   Storm watches were in effect for parts of the Dominican Republic,
and a hurricane warning was issued for the southern Bahamas,
including the Turks and Caicos islands.
   The weather service said winds ripped the roof off a baseball
stadium on Vieques, an island with 7,000 residents 10 miles east of
Puerto Rico.
   Bernard Sternberg, a Sunrise, Fla., ham radio operator, said he
talked to a radio operator who was on a boat in the eye of the
hurricane as it passed over Vieques. ``He asked us to pray for him
and we did,'' Sternberg said. ``We prayed for all of them.''
   High winds Sunday blew roofs off six houses in the offshore
island of Culebra. San Juan's Luis Munoz Marin International
Airport, by far the region's biggest, was closed, as were schools,
banks, courts and government offices.
   Navy Lt. Cmdr. Steve Burnett, spokesman for the Atlantic Fleet in
Norfolk, Va., reported ``some damage to buildings and housing'' at
Roosevelt Roads Naval Station on Puerto Rico's northeastern coast.
``At this point, we don't know the extent of the damage,'' he said.
   Burnett said all Navy ships that had been operating in the area
moved north over the last 48 hours.
   Residents of hilly areas where flash floods are a danger were
urged to evacuate, and Social Services Secretary Carmen Sonia Zayas
said 11,300 people were moved from flood-prone coastal areas to
rescue shelters.
   The Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico were last hit by a major
hurricane in 1956, when Betsy caused extensive damage and killed 11
people in Puerto Rico.
   Hugo is the fourth hurricane of the Atlantic hurricane season and
is the most powerful hurricane to hit the region since Hurricane
David in 1979. That storm killed an estimated 1,200 people in the
Caribbean and Florida.
   In Paris, the French Defense Ministry assigned 3,000 soldiers,
two military transport aircraft and four cargo vessels to assist in
restoring communications and emergency services to Guadeloupe.

   Hurricane Hugo brushed across Puerto Rico on Monday, bringing
sustained winds near 125 mph and heavy rain, causing extensive
damage and interfering with communications.
   Hugo, the most powerful storm to strike the region in a decade,
was blamed for at least 14 deaths.
   Meteorologist Jesse Moore at the National Hurricane Center said
it was too early to tell if Hugo would strike the U.S. mainland. He
said it was expected to be off the southeastern Bahamas by Wednesday
and ``after that, it's anybody's guess.''
   Behind Hugo, Tropical Storm Iris was about 300 miles from the
Lesser Antilles with a maximum sustained wind speed of around 50
mph. Strengthening was not expected because of the proximity of Hugo.
   Elsewhere, showers and thunderstorms were widespread across much
of the Florida Peninsula, south of a frontal system in very warm
humid air. Hail the size of golf balls pelted Amelia Island during
the morning, the National Weather Service said. A tornado was
reported at Fernandina Beach near Amelia Island, the weather service
said.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered over the central Pacific
Coast and into the northern Rockies as low pressure in the upper
atmosphere developed over Northern California. Street flooding was
reported in parts of Sacramento, Calif., the weather service said.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 38
degrees at Truckee, Calif., to 94 at Brownsville, Texas. Monday's
low in the Lower 48 states was 30 at both Burns and Redmond, Ore.
   For Tuesday, widespread showers and isolated thunderstorms were
forecast from central and Southern California into Wyoming and
central South Dakota. Scattered showers and thunderstorms were
forecast from Florida across the southern and middle Atlantic Coast.
   Highs only in the 60s were predicted across the Pacific
Northwest, the Great Basin of Nevada and western Utah, and the
northern parts of New England; in the low to mid 90s across much of
Texas; and in the 70s or 80s across much of the rest of the nation.

<TEXT>
   Here is a transcript of President Bush's
Monday news conference in Helena, Mont.
   President Bush: Well, I have a brief statement, and then I'll be
glad to respond to some questions.
   I have decided, and Secretary Mosbacher has announced in Hungary,
that Hungary will be granted permanent Most Favored Nation, MFN,
status in October, and will be granted the benefits of a generalized
system of preferences.
   Hungary's undertaken major steps toward political and economic
reform. And during our recent visit, we witnessed significant
changes toward freedom in that country.
   The dedication and diligence of the Hungarian people is quickly
transforming the economic system into a more productive and
competitive posture.
   GSP eligibility will open new doors for the Hungarian economy,
encouraging greater market orientation and increasing the foreign
exchange earnings. Our commitment to helping the reform movement in
Eastern Europe is strong. Our step today underscores our willingness
to help these countries.
   Obviously, it's up to them to make the structural adjustments,
but they should be aware that the United States is ready and willing
to assist in this progress.
   Let me just say a word on economic growth at home. There is an
issue before the Congress which I feel is just the kind of thing
that will help states like Montana bolster their economic
productivity and employment. A reduction in our capital gains tax
rate is right for Montana, and it is good for America, and I am
pleased that there has been a bipartisan effort in the Congress to
bring this issue to the House floor. I'm hopeful that the Congress
will continue in this bipartisan spirit.
   And now I'll be glad to respond to some questions.
   Q: Mr. President...
   President Bush: Oh, excuse me -- (here we've got a friend ?) even
though we're out of town.
   Q: When you meet on Thursday with Mr. Shevardnadze of the Soviet
Union, there's a lot of speculation that he will bring with him a
major new strategic arms proposal from the Soviet Union. Are
conditions ripe now to move ahead on a strategic arms agreement? Or
is there a chance that further delays may make it impossible to
reach such an agreement in your term?
   President Bush: I don't _ I would not take that pessimistic an
assessment, that further delay will make it impossible to make _
reach an agreement in the next 3{ years. I don't know, Tom, what he
is going to bring with him. I've read speculation that there might
be a new arms control proposal, but I can't confirm that for you.
   We do want to move forward on START. As you know, we came in, did
a review, completed a review, and we will _ we're working inside our
own administration to have proposals that I think will capture the
imagination of the Soviet Union. But I don't know what he's going to
bring; we haven't had that confirmed.
   Q: Follow-up? May I have a follow-up?
   President Bush: Yeah.
   Q: Mr. President, is it time now to talk about a summit with Mr.
Gorbachev?
   President Bush: No, it's time to talk about a constructive,
productive meeting of the foreign ministers out in Wyoming. And
we'll have to see what message Mr. Shevardnadze brings with him, but
I feel under any _ under no rush on that subject.
   I think our handling of the Soviet account is pretty good. I feel
we've got experts in whom I have great confidence that are handling
these matters: the Secretary of State; General Scowcroft; Bob Gates
with us here today; Dick Cheney; the chairman of the Joint Chiefs.
   And so I think the key point is, does the Soviet Union understand
that we want to see their perestroika succeed and see them move
forward with more liberties? And I think they do understand that.
And so I don't think there's any chance of a disconnect there.

   Zsa Zsa Gabor kept her lip buttoned
Monday regarding her trial on a charge of slapping a policeman,
taking to heart a judge's warning that further comments about the
case could land her in trouble.
   ``I'm under gagging order,'' Miss Gabor told reporters at Beverly
Hills Municipal Court, where her trial began its second week.
   She is charged with four misdemeanor charges: battery on a police
officer, disobeying an officer's orders, driving with an expired
license and having an open container of alcohol in her car. If
convicted, she faces a possible 18 months in jail.
   Last week, Miss Gabor got in her best zingers when she arrived at
court, but Monday morning she glided out of her Chevrolet station
wagon and said ``no comment'' more than seven times when questioned
by a dozen reporters and television camera crews.
   She even said ``no comment'' when asked about her ensemble, white
slacks and a navy blue blazer.
   Last week, Miss Gabor said she was afraid of going to jail
because of lesbians there. She also made unflattering remarks about
the prosecutor, saying: ``He has a Napoleon complex,'' and
confronted a TV reporter the actress deemed ``a jealous bitch.''
   She also called the policeman she is accused of striking a liar.
   When Miss Gabor did talk to reporters Monday, she limited her
comments to small talk. ``My mother is very upset and (sister) Eva
could kill me'' regarding the publicity accompanying the trial, she
said.
   Gone from the courthouse were Zsa Zsa look-alikes and throngs of
sympathetic fans. In their place was a man wearing a ``Hang Zsa
Zsa'' T-shirt and a woman who gave a long-winded story to the
actress about needing $480 to pay a speeding ticket in Texas.
   Miss Gabor gave her a $20 traveler's check and the woman
complained it wasn't enough.
   Motorcycle policeman Paul Kramer said the alleged June 14 assault
was unprovoked. Miss Gabor, a foot shorter and 100 pounds lighter
than Kramer, said she struck in self defense.
   Kramer pulled over Miss Gabor's Rolls-Royce for having expired
registration tags. As he checked for other violations, Miss Gabor
allegedly drove off, was stopped again and ultimately slapped
Kramer's face.
   Kramer, who conceded at one point that he wore a ``Free Zsa Zsa''
T-shirt at his recent 38th birthday party, testified that Miss Gabor
cursed, spit and slapped him.
   Deputy District Attorney Elden Fox called four witnesses to the
stand during the morning Monday, with only one of them saying she
actually saw the slap.
   Maureen Cassidy said she was looking in her rearview mirror when
she saw Kramer being struck.
   Defense attorney William Graysen informed Municipal Judge Charles
G. Rubin that Miss Gabor's house was broken into over the weekend.
He attributed the incident to publication of her address in a
newspaper story.
   ``It's just unfortunate it occurred,'' the judge said, saying
there was little he could do.

<HEAD>Banks Seek More Government Aid to Cut Third World Debt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Banks are asking the U.S. government and others
for more help in reducing the debt burden that led to the transfer
last year of more than $50 billion from the Third World to creditor
countries.
   ``If sufficient collateral is not made available, large numbers
of banks may turn away from the transaction,'' said Horst Schulmann,
managing director of the Institute of International Finance, which
includes major international banks.
   Schulmann was talking about the first part of a debt reduction
plan proposed by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady that gives
commercial banks a choice on dealing with about half of Mexico's
$108 billion debt. The banks may either reduce the debt, reduce the
interest payments or lend new money to pay interest at old rates.
   Choices by hundreds of banks have yet to be made. The collateral
that some of them want could be in the form of U.S. government
bonds, which Mexico would put up as security for loans at lower
rates of interest than it now pays. Money to buy those bonds can be
lent to debtor countries by the World Bank and International
Monetary Fund if the United States agrees to make them available.
   Schulmann's warning was in a letter he sent Sept. 12 to leaders
of the twin organizations, which he made public Monday. Officials
and bankers from the member countries are gathering for their annual
meetings, which will begin at the end of this week and end the week
after.
   Third World debt and the progress of Brady's plan are expected to
be among the major topics. Brady will be the chief U.S.
representative at the meetings.
   On Sunday, the World Bank published its annual report, including
a table that showed how transfers _ including payments for goods _
from Third World countries to creditors grew to $50.1 billion last
year from $10.2 billion in 1984. Before that, the flow had been in
the opposite direction, with money going from the creditor countries
to the Third World.
   J. Fred Bergsten, a former assistant secretary of the Treasury,
has suggested that the outflow should be the direct target of attack
by the world's financial experts. It is the outflow of funds from
Third World countries, largely payments to banks, that keeps them
from spending more on goods from the United States and other
countries to create jobs and raise living standards in their own.
   In 1988 they paid $75.4 billion on their foreign debts, and $67
billion of interest, the World Bank reported. Another source of
outflow is the billions _ uncounted because often illegal _ sent by
their citizens for safekeeping to the United States and other
havens. One recent estimate put this flight of capital at $12
billion a year from Brazil alone.
   The Treasury Department calculated that 39 countries could be
eligible for debt reductions, but Schulmann told reporters on Monday
he did not see so many.
   ``The list would be rather short,'' he said.

   Former President Jose Napoleon
Duarte, who has terminal liver cancer, has given up his struggle
against the disease, his physician said Monday.
   Dr. Jose Luis Saca said in an interview that Duarte ``is in low
spirits and doesn't want to fight against the disease.''
   Duarte, 63, who left office on June 1 after a five years in the
presidency, has received regular treatment in the United States.
   Duarte ``doesn't get out of bed and feels pain,'' Saca said.
``He's always been a fighter, but he has thrown in the towel.''
   In June 1988, Duarte underwent surgery at Walter Reed Hospital in
Washington. Doctors at that time gave him six to 18 more months to
live.
   Saca would not predict how much longer Duarte would survive.
   ``The cancer has picked up speed,'' he said.

<HEAD>$600,000 Fine Against California Firm</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission on Monday
reaffirmed its $600,000 fine against a California company after
finding that the firm did nothing to prevent children from hearing
its obscene phone messages.
   The commission, saying that Intercambio of San Jose, Calif., had
not provided any persuasive reason why it should not be fined,
ordered the company to pay the penalty within 30 days or face
criminal prosecution.
   The commission, in reaffirming a July 6, 1988, notice of apparent
liability, said Intercambio had raised no new material questions of
fact to support its contention that it had not ``violated FCC
regulations'' and that the fine was ``both unjustified and
unlawful.''
   The FCC said the law allows for fines of $50,000 a day for each
of 70 days' violations.
   The FCC on Dec. 7, 1987, first notified Intercambio that it was
contemplating action following a complaint from a mother who said
her 16-year-old son was hearing pornographic messages from
Intercambio. The woman said the boy was seeing a psychiatrist after
placing more than 280 calls to various dial-a-porn providers during
a 2{-month period.
   Intercambio told the FCC that its service was intended to be
available only within California, that it had attempted to restrict
access to adults and that the law regarding pornographic phone
messages and FCC rules on the subject were unconstitutional.
   But the firm refused to provide any evidence to back up its
claims, said FCC Commissioner Patricia Diaz Dennis.
   The commission said it had conducted a four-month investigation
and found Intercambio was placing no restrictions to prevent minors
from dialing in. Nor did it find any restrictions in place to
prevent interstate calls, the FCC said. Interstate dial-a-porn calls
to minors are banned under federal law.
   ``As a result of its investigation, the staff found the evidence
conclusive that Intercambio's messages were obscene and that it had
in fact operated and was continuing to operate in violation of'' the
law, the commission said.
   There was no phone number listed for Intercambio in San Jose and
attempts to locate a number for Intercambio's president, Dan
Glassoff, were unsuccessful Monday.
   Congress last year, in an attempt to wipe out the dial-a-porn
industry, outlawed the sale of indecent phone messages. But the
Supreme Court in June said that only obscene material _ patently
offensive, sexual and without redeeming value _ may be banned.
   Congress acted because of complaints from outraged parents who
incurred heavy phone bills from children dialing 976 numbers to
listen to sexually oriented material.
   But the Supreme Court said that recent technological advances
such as call blocking by phone companies assured that children could
be kept from reaching dial-a-porn services and that the government
had no compelling reason to ban such calls for adults.
   Another California company that also had faced a $600,000 fine
for allegedly providing obscene phone messages agreed last November
to stop selling sexual phone messages and paid a smaller amount to
the government without admitting liability.
   Mary Beth Hess, chief of the FCC's enforcement division, said
Monday that Audio Enterprises of Mill Valley, Calif., paid the
government $50,000 and is out of the phone sex business.
   A third company, 2001 Enterprises of Reseda, Calif. agreed to
stop its sexually oriented message business and paid the government
$25,000, Hess said.

<HEAD>Judge Fines UMW As Members Continue Demonstrations</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A judge fined the United Mine Workers union
$13.5 million Monday for illegal strike activities in its lengthy
contract dispute with Pittston Coal Group.
   But elsewhere in Russell County, UMW members continued to occupy
the control room of Pittston's main coal preparation plant, where
they locked themselves in with padlocks and steel cables.
   Union leaders said the takeover that began Sunday would remain
peaceful and promised that no damage would be done to the plant,
where coal is sorted, cleaned and shipped. They said the
demonstration was designed to persuade Pittston Co. Chairman Paul
Douglas to come to the bargaining table and as a statement against
unfair labor laws.
   The plant was shut down Monday, but Pittston spokeswoman Susan
Copeland said mines operated by replacement workers continued to
operate.
   Pittston's 1,695 UMW employees from Virginia, West Virginia and
Kentucky are involved in the strike that began April 5. But the
strike has become a symbolic dispute for organized labor across the
country because the workers believe Pittston is attempting to break
the union.
   The Pittston strike prompted wildcat walkouts by miners elsewhere
in June and July.
   In Richmond, union members pitched an awning on grounds of the
state Capitol and began a weeklong demonstration against what they
called injustices in the coalfields.
   The fines imposed Monday by Russell County Circuit Judge Donald
McGlothlin bring the total to roughly $22 million the fines imposed
by state and federal judges for illegal demonstrations against
Pittston and for acts of violence against company property and
employees.
   The fines have been appealed.
   An industry observer who spoke on condition he not be identified
because he arbitrates labor disputes, said Monday that the UMW
strike fund can easily cover the $22 million in fines if appeals
fail. Also, companies often forego damages after a contract
settlement is reached.
   ``I wouldn't call it a drop in the bucket but I wouldn't call it
a mortal blow, either,'' he said. ``If allowed to stand, it could
have a crippling effect on the union's use of civil disobedience.''
   The charges of violence during the past two months range from
shooting at moving coal trucks to peppering employee vehicles with
rocks. Charges of non-violent activities included sit-down
demonstrations and rolling roadblocks designed to slow coal truck
traffic.
   UMW attorneys argued last week that union leaders have
continually preached non-violence to members and that the union
should not be punished for acts by individuals.
   McGlothlin said testimony proved beyond a reasonable doubt that
union leaders had encouraged the illegal activities.
   One provision in McGlothlin's injunction prohibits union members
and supporters from impeding Pittston's operations.
   However, neither the judge nor Pittston took action by
mid-afternoon to remove the demonstrators occupying the preparation
plant.
   State police will take no action until either the company issues
a trespassing complaint or a judge requests enforcement of his
injunction, said spokesman Charlie Vaughan.

   Q: Mr. President?
   President Bush: Yeah, Norm.
   Q: Why hasn't there been more progress on START? By the time that
Shevardnadze arrives on Thursday, you'll have _ or be close to
having a couple of modest agreements, one on chemical arms
inspection, one on nuclear testing. You're moving ahead with an
innovative plan on conventional weapons, but there's a perception
here that the administration just has not been willing or had the
desire to move forward as fast and with concrete action on START as
it has elsewhere.
   President Bush: That may _ that perception may have come about
because we did put the earliest effort into conventional forces.
   I happen to think that that's the place the earliest efforts
should have gone, into getting some conventional force stability.
And therefore, we did move forward more quickly on that, but I don't
think it's right to read into that effort _ incidentally, a proposal
that captured the imagination not just of the West, but of many in
the East as well _ to indicate from that we're not interested in
going forward on START.
   Or let me throw in chemical weapons. You know, most of you here
have heard me speak about the importance of trying to do something
in the chemical weapons area. So the fact that we've tabled one
imaginative and I'd say far-reaching proposal should not mean that
we're not interested or unwilling to go forward with START.
   But that may be how, if there is such a perception, how it came
about.
   Q: Is it that those START issues, or the last four remaining big
issues on START, are too difficult? Are the differences between the
U.S. and the Soviets too deep? Are the problems with the current
administration too great?
   President Bush: I don't think any of that. I mean, maybe some of
the above, but not all. I mean, these are not easy problems.
Verification issues aren't easy. I would simply say that I don't see
any insurmountable stumbling blocks there, though.
   Ellen?
   Q: Mr. President, closer to home _ in the past few months there
have been a number of racial incidents in this country _ blacks
attacking whites, whites attacking blacks. Sir, what does this say
about the state of racial relations in our country?
   President Bush: Well, it says something ugly whenever there's an
incident of that nature. I hope there's no trend toward more and
more divisiveness along racial lines. And I will do my best to speak
out against bigotry wherever it occurs, racism wherever it occurs,
in what direction it goes, and against violence of any kind.
   Q: But to the crux of the matter, sir: Is there anything that
either yourself or the present government or even the state
government can do to end what seems to be a new trend in interracial
violence?
   President Bush: I don't want to give you this _ I don't want to
say to you, it's a new _ I don't want to accept that premise. I
don't feel that there's a new trend of racial hostility. But when
these _ these regrettable incidents occur, I think that all of us
should unite in speaking out against them. But I don't think that
there's a federal statute that is going to take care of an incident
of that nature.
   Yeah?
   Q: Mr. President, the Colombia media are saying that the drug
cartels are arming themselves with rapid-fire weapons manufactured
in the United States and smuggled into their country. Given the fact
that we're asking Colombian authorities to put themselves at risk in
order to deal with this drug problem, how can you justify refusing
to ban the sale and manufacture of those weapons in the United
States?
   President Bush: Well, I think everybody here knows my position on
guns and banning guns. I do feel one thing we can do is cut down on
the automatic clips that are used, the amount of fire coming out of
one of those guns. We've made proposals. And I think we ought to get
in _ get along supporting the president's proposals in the
anti-crime package. And that will send a very strong signal to
Colombia.
   Yeah?
   Q: Can I follow up ...
   President Bush: You want to follow his question?
   No. He's goes here, and then you're second, however. (Chuckles.)
   Q: Mr. President, there have been reports that the Colombian drug
lords have targeted people in the United States and maybe even
members of your own family. I was wondering if you had any message
for any drug traffickers in Colombia who might be thinking along
those lines?
   President Bush: I think I take a rather dim view of it. But there
_ look, I know there's speculation on this, but there is no hard
intelligence evidence of such targeting.

<HEAD>Dissident Policeman Says South African Minister Should Resign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A police lieutenant who stirred
controversy by accusing riot squad members of brutality said Monday
that Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok should resign.
   Lt. Gregory Rockman commented after he and other mixed-race
policemen waited 40 minutes before being told a scheduled meeting
with Vlok was canceled.
   Two hours later, Vlok showed up at the police station in
Mitchell's Plain, Cape Town's largest mixed-race township. Rockman
was away on police business, but he later told reporters Vlok ``just
gave another pep talk'' without listening to officers' complaints.
   ``A lot was said and it meant nothing,'' Rockman said. ``I
definitely feel he should resign.''
   The state-run South African Broadcasting Corp. said Vlok
apologized for a ``misunderstanding'' which caused him to to miss
the meeting.
   Rockman moved into the spotlight on Sept. 6, when he publicly
accused white riot squad officers of having behaved like ``wild
dogs,'' beating and whipping schoolchildren and bystanders at an
anti-election protest in Mitchell's Plain.
   Vlok visited several police stations near Cape Town on Monday. He
told riot squad members a smile could be more effective than a club
at times in defusing trouble. He also said problems in the police
force should be handled ``within the family.''

<HEAD>Pravda Prints Scathing Criticism of Yeltsin's Behavior in U.S.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with U.S. sponsor's denial of charges
against Yeltsin, quotes. No pickup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition legislator Boris N. Yeltsin shopped and
drank until he dropped on his tour of the United States, said a
scathing article reprinted Monday in te Communist Party newspaper
Pravda.
   The Communist Party maverick ``leaves behind him a wake of
catastrophic prophecies, insane expenses, interviews, and above all
the perfume of Jack Daniels Black label,'' the Italian newspaper La
Repubblica said in an article translated into Russian and printed in
full by Pravda.
   Yeltsin heatedly denied the report when he returned to Moscow
late Monday evening.
   In Washington, his sponsor blamed jet lag and a hectic schedule,
not overindulgence in alcohol, for whatever problems Yeltsin
encountered on his visit. The sponsor said Pravda had political
motivations for what it did.
   Pravda did not comment on the article. But it gave its readers a
taste of the page 5 piece in a front-page box quoting the article as
saying Yeltsin found the United States ``a holiday, a stage, a bar
5,000 kilometers long.''
   ``It's garbage,'' Yeltsin told The Associated Press, flushing
with anger.
   ``It's a simple lie, slander, and revenge for the fact that
Americans received us with admiration,'' he said before slipping
into a black Volga car to be whisked into Moscow.
   The article is potentially very damaging to the silver-haired,
58-year-old populist who has become a hero to many Soviets by
criticizing special privileges for party and government officials
and urging that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev speed up his reforms.
   It raises the question of the character of a leading politician
more clearly than has been done in decades. It also cast Yeltsin as
enjoying the good life just as much as the Moscow officials he
criticizes while Soviets line up for sugar, meat and dozens of other
everyday items.
   But previous attacks on Yeltsin have been regarded by his
supporters as an effort by powerful Kremlin figures to discredit
him, and Yeltsin has turned that deep-rooted suspicion of central
authority to his advantage.
   Yeltsin returned one day ahead of a crucial Communist Party
Central Committee meeting on ethnic unrest. Central Committee
meetings also are empowered to consider personnel questions, and
Yeltsin could be asked during the closed meeting to explain his
behavior, or censured.
   Earlier this year, party officials investigated Yeltsin for
allegedly speaking out in favor of a multiparty system.
   La Repubblica, a left-leaning Rome daily with one of Italy's
largest circulations, ran the article by Vittorio Zucconi on page 4
of its Sept. 14 edition.
   The story said Yeltsin drank a bottle-and-a-half of Jack Daniels
whisky by himself one night in Baltimore, where he was a guest of
Johns Hopkins University.
   ``When a distinguished professor emeritus came to pick Yeltsin up
at 6 a.m. for a speech, he was presented with a wet and alcoholic
kiss and an invitation to finish off the half-empty bottle,'' the
story said.
   ```Let's drink to freedom,' Yeltsin said and offered the
professor the bathroom toothbrush glass filled with bourbon,'' it
added.
   It reported that Yeltsin had too much to drink and fell asleep
with his head on a table during one reception.
   The story said Yeltsin bought new clothes, shoes, boxes of white
shirts, two VCRs and a selection of videotapes including the three
``Rambo'' movies, ``Star Wars,'' and ``E.T.''
   Yeltsin's speaking fees were to be donated to Soviet AIDS
victims, but Zucconi quoted accountant Alfred Ross as saying, ``If
he keeps spending at this pace by the time he leaves we'll have
nothing but debts.''
   Yeltsin's American host denied in Washington on Monday that
Yeltsin was intoxicated in public during his U.S. trip.
   ``If there was any problem with Yeltsin, it was jet lag,'' said
Jim Garrison, executive director of the Esalen Institute
Soviet-American Exchange Program, of San Francisco, which sponsored
the visit.
   ``What Pravda has done is for political motivations.
   ``Most of the time he was cold sober ...
   ``He certainly did not finish off a bottle and a half of Jack
Daniels. The entire delegation of five Soviets drank a bottle.''
   Garrison said that by the time Yeltsin spoke in Baltimore Tuesday
night, the same day he visited the White House, ``he had not slept
for three nights.''
   Garrison said he personally canceled a scheduled TV appearance by
Yeltsin to be taped the afternoon before the Baltimore speech
because Yeltsin was ``jet-lagged. He was just dropping.'' He said
Yeltsin had no alcohol that day.
   ``We did 11 cities in nine days,'' said Garrison, adding that the
Soviet politician ``will accept none of the proceeds. ... We gave
him $100 a day as a per diem. So he had $900 of personal money. That
is all he had.'' He said Yeltsin also was given a personal computer.
   During his tour, Yeltsin said Gorbachev could face a revolution
if he cannot improve living conditions soon. He met with President
Bush and Vice President Quayle and paid an unexpected visit to
former President Reagan, who was recuperating from surgery.
   Soviet officials and the state press have not commented on
Yeltsin's U.S. tour. Soviet officials have said the trip is
Yeltsin's private business.
   But the press has reprinted comments made by Yeltsin that were
reported in the Western media and could be damaging to him.
   Yeltsin, the former Communist Party chief of Moscow, was stripped
of that job almost two years ago by Gorbachev, who criticized him as
politically immature and overly ambitious.
   But Muscovites in March gave him 89 percent of the vote in an
election for a city-wide seat in the new Congress of People's
Deputies parliament.
   A month and a half ago, he was elected along with Nobel Peace
Prize winner Andrei D. Sakharov and a handful of other reformers to
the steering committee of the first organized opposition in the
Soviet parliament in 70 years.

<TEXT>
   So let me just lay that one out there to rest. But clearly, any
such action would, I think, just bring down the total wrath of the
American people and the American government.
   But, as I tried to make clear at one of our last press
conferences, sometimes the courageous government in South America
has difficulty controlling its own fortunes.
   And one of the reasons I have objected to some of this
far-sweeping legislation on the Hill about ``Let's cut off all South
American countries from which these drugs come into this country''
is that that would stand up against President Barco for _ who is
doing his level best to confine this and to control it in Colombia.
   Q: Are you afraid for the security of your family, sir?
   President Bush: No, I'm not. I'm not afraid. I have great
confidence in the selflessness and in the thoroughness of the
intelligence community and of the Secret Service.
   Yeah? And then I'll come back, John.
   Q: You said last Friday that you would not extend to domestically
made semi-automatic weapons the ban you placed on imported weapons.
Are there any restrictions at all that you would accept, if Congress
approved them, on those weapons?
   President Bush: Well, I'd be glad to talk to Congress about it,
but basically I think the thing to do is go forward and approach the
problem by passing our anti-crime bill.
   I used the analogy the other day of the person in the tower with
an automatic _ I mean a quick-firing rifle, and _ as a view that
it's going to be very, very hard to legislate against aberrational
behavior. And I have long felt that the answer is to go after the
criminal and not the _ in the process do violence to the rights of
legitimate gun owners.
   John.
   Q: We are told that Yasir Arafat is preparing a visa request so
he can come to the UN General Assembly to speak. Now that the U.S.
has opened a dialogue with the PLO, would you have any objection to
Arafat coming to New York?
   President Bush: I will consider that matter when and if it comes
to my attention. I'm not _ you've heard something I haven't heard,
that he is preparing a visa request. But I will look at that _ what
I mean is I'm not going to answer your question right now because I
don't know the final answer, but we would _ obviously, it is a
decision that would come to me, but it's not that far along.
   Yeah?
   Q: Mr. President, back on capital gains, the tax rate cut, the
Democrats on Capitol Hill seem plainly determined to make it a major
party question. How do you deal with that going into the floor
debate in the House, and how does that tie in to the grand strategy
that we keep hearing about for a major budget compromise in the next
year?
   President Bush: Well, it ties into the fact that I ran for office
in this state and in 49 other states on a platform that included
very clearly a capital gains differential. And I happen to feel that
it is good for more _ creating more jobs. I think it is good for
risk-taking. I think it is something that should happen.
   So we'll fight for it on the floor, and hopefully get it passed,
and then approach the follow-on budget considerations. But this
concept that I'm hearing from some who are on the other side of the
issue _ ``Well, if you insist on this, then we won't talk to you
about A, B or C for the future,'' I don't think that's right, and I
don't think the American people would support that.
   There was a good, clear fight in that committee, and at this
juncture, at least, after lots of amendments, my side prevailed on a
bipartisan way, a lot of Democrats supporting us.
   And now we go to the floor. And then, whatever comes out of the
floor, we have to fit in obviously to the budgetary requirements for
next year. But I don't think it is right for people who get whipped
on an issue in a committee to then start a lot of threats about _ on
the other side saying, ``Well, we'll never deal with the President.''
   It doesn't work that way. You know why? Because the American
people have a say. And they had a say last year about this question,
and they'll have a say in the future. And it is not, as my critics
contend, a tax that'll simply help the rich. A lot of countries
don't have any tax on capital at all.
   Yeah, John.

<HEAD>Polish Communists Invite Western Reporters to Meeting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The communist party's Central Committee
decided on Monday to poll party members to see if support exists for
increasing democracy within the party and Poland.
   For the first time in memory, Western reporters were invited to
watch party leaders convene the Central Committee meeting. It was
closed to the reporters later in the day.
   The meeting also was the first committee plenum since the
Solidarity-led government took over a week ago.
   Politburo member Leszek Miller told reporters after the 11-hour
meeting that the plenum's second half will be held Sept. 30, when
results of the poll are known.
   In a speech opening the meeting, Miller urged greater solidarity
among party members facing the first government in the East bloc not
led by communists . He said the communists must form ``a front of
the social left.''
   Miller said the poll will ask members four questions: If they
support direct election of delegates to the planned 11th communist
party congress; if candidates for party membership should be allowed
to vote for delegates; if competing platforms to develop the party
program will be allowed, and whether deep changes in the party are
favored.
   He said options for the party's future include if it should stay
the same, become a more leftist force or form a new socialist party.
He did not elaborate.
   Miller said the Central Committee will follow the recommendations
of the majority. The powerful Central Committee carries on the work
of the party between congresses and forms the policy-making
Politburo.
   Party First Secretary Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski, who invited Western
journalists to the plenum, said, ``I would not say this is the
beginning of a new style of work but we assume that our debate ...
is not secret and cannot be secret because the party is functioning
before the eyes of the whole society.''
   No exact date has been set for the party congress, but the
Central Committee plenum is to advise the congress on the structure
and goals of the party. The party controlled the government for four
decades until Solidarity's Tadeusz Mazowiecki was sworn in as prime
minister.
   Central Committee secretary Slawomir Wiatr rejected a suggestion
that the party might split into reform and hard-line wings,
according to the state news agency PAP.
   It quoted Wiatr as saying, ``Emotions are high and postulates
clashing but there will be no break up of the party.''
   Since the independent trade union Solidarity was first legalized
in August 1980, communist party membership has fallen from 3.15
million to just below 2.1 million. The average age of a party member
is 46, compared with 40 in 1980, according to a party report
published last month.
   Solidarity was suspended in December 1981 and later outlawed. It
was legalized again this year and scored stunning victories in
parliamentary elections in June.
   Fully democratic elections are scheduled in four years and the
communist party has vowed to be ready.
   More than 20 speakers adressed the Central Committee plenum and
discussed ways ``to strengthen the party's authority and gain broad
social support,'' PAP said.
   The agency reported committee members expressed special concern
about Mazowiecki's plans to create more private business,
restructure industry and turn toward a market-oriented economy.

   Q: Mr. President, a few minutes ago you told the state
legislators that Washington does not know best on the subject of
education. At the summit, education summit next week in Charlotte,
though, many of the governors, not all Democratic, are going to say
they want more from Washington. How are you going to reconcile those
differences?
   President Bush: Many want more, and sometimes justifiably so. But
I can't think of a governor that's going to come to me and say,
``Tell us how to do it. Mandate it.'' Mandated benefits from
Washington. We've had enough of that. And I am against that. And I
will make it clear _ I don't care how many of them come and say that.
   But I don't think any will, John. I don't think they want
control. Of course governors are going to want additional resources
of one kind or another. And maybe we can accommodate them, or maybe
we can't. But I don't think they want that control of education,
what they call ``mandated benefits.'' I'm absolutely certain they
don't. Yes?
   Q: Mr. President, how much did it figure in your decision on
Hungary and trade their facilitating the travel to the West of East
Germans?
   President Bush: Well, to be candid with you, it was in the mix
before that rather _ those dramatic happenings. And I think their
overall economic performance merits it.
   But clearly when a country takes a courageous decision, that's
just of additional benefit to this relationship that's growing and
that is very, very important. Way in the back.
   Q: Mr. President, the recent access of East Germans to West
Germany has got a lot of people thinking about eventual
reunification of Germany, whether that would be a good idea or not.
Do you think a reunified Germany would be a stabilizing force for
America or a destabilizing force?
   President Bush: Well, I don't _ I would think it's a matter for
the Germans to decide. But put it this way: If that was worked out
between the Germanys, I do not think we should view that as bad for
Western interests.
   I think there's been a dramatic change in post-World War II
Germany. And so I don't fear it, but I _ and I noticed that the
Chancellor had something to say on this the other day; I might need
help from Bob. But nevertheless, he _ this is something that should
be for them to determine. But I think there is in some quarters the
feeling, ``Well, a reunified Germany would be detrimental to the
peace of Europe, of Western Europe, some way,'' and I don't accept
that at all. I simply don't.
   Yeah, Frank.
   Q: Mr. President, throughout your speeches today, you've talked a
great deal about the stewardship of the environment. Yet you haven't
mentioned the Alaska oil spill, and you decided not to go _ you
dropped plans to go to Alaska as an extension of this trip.
Shouldn't an environmental president have visited the site of this
terrible oil spill?
   President Bush: We had an environmental vice president that went,
and gave an accurate report, and an environmental head of the EPA
that went and gave a good report, and an environmentally conscious
head of the Coast Guard that went. And I would like to have gone up
there, and maybe I'll get to go.
   But I don't think the fact that you don't go somewhere shows _ of
this nature, with this _ at this time _ shows a lack of interest at
all. And I am hopeful that the winter will be kind to the
environmental damage there and help follow on to what man has tried
to do.
   But please don't associate my not going to Alaska, at a rather
busy time, with a lack of interest in Prince William Sound.
   Q: If I may follow up, sir, are you satisfied with Exxon's
efforts? Do you believe that they will either themselves be back in
the spring or that you'll be sending them the bill for more work to
be done?
   President Bush: Well, we have to see, but they will come back
there, I'm convinced of that, if the matter is not further along;
there's no question, and I think they've said that. But we will be
looking to them.
   Yeah _ one, two, three.
   Q: Mr. President, it's been 3{ months since the massacre in
Tiananmen Square, and American businessmen, including your brother,
are now back making deals with the Chinese. Are you willing now to
resume normal relations with the Chinese government?
   President Bush: We _ no, no, we're not. We have relations. I've
tried to protect and preserve a long-time relationship that is very
important to us _ to the United States. It's in the national
security interest, in the geopolitical interest of the United States
to have a relationship.
   But, no, it's not time for total normalcy; and I would hope that
we would see proper signals that would indicate to me that is, you
know, in the future. But I don't want to hurt the people by cutting
off commerce from the West. I've said that early on, right at the
beginning, and I haven't changed my mind on that one. But there are
still difficulties, great difficulties there.
   Yes, Saul. And then Chuck.

   Palestinians in the occupied territories closed
shops and schools, and marched on the seventh anniversary Monday of
the Sabra and Chatilla camp massacres in Beirut, Arab reports said.
   At least 19 Palestinians were reported wounded, including a
13-year-old boy shot in the chest, in clashes with soldiers in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, hospital officials said.
   Residents raised outlawed PLO flags in Yata, 7 miles south of
Jerusalem, and marched with pictures of Palestinians killed in the
21-month-long uprising against Israeli rule, Arab reports said. Two
residents were reportedly shot by soldiers during the march.
   Three Palestinians were wounded in a similar clash in nearby
Dura, Arab reports said.
   The army said troops in Dura came under a hail of stones and
fired, wounding three Arabs. It said it was checking the other
reports.
   In the Gaza Strip, at least 14 Arabs were wounded by Israeli army
gunfire, hospital officials said.
   The general strike, called by the uprising leadership, shut down
the occupied territories to mark the 1982 massacre of hundreds of
Palestinians by Israel's Christian allies in the Sabra and Chatilla
refugee camps in Beirut.
   Since the uprising against Israeli rule began in December 1987,
572 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers or civilians
and 114 have been slain by fellow Arabs as suspected collaborators
with Israel. Forty Israelis also have died in the violence.

   Q: Yes, does your action on Hungary today indicate that you might
be moving closer toward some similar action with the Soviet Union?
   President Bush: Well, one of the matters that will be discussed
in the Wyoming meeting will be the whole economic front _ and
perhaps that. But I couldn't say that, in our decision-making
process at the White House and the State Department, that it's been
moved forward, knowing of this decision on Hungary.
   Q: Well, I wonder why not, since the Soviet Union approved
Hungary's action vis-a-vis East Germany and at the same time they
have released so many American _ so many Jews _
   President Bush: Soviet Jews.
   Q: _ that we don't know what to do with them _ Soviet Jews. We
don't _
   President Bush: Well, there are encouraging signs coming out of
the Soviet Union.
   Q: I wonder _
   President Bush: And we're going to continue to look at them
closely, continue to have contacts with the Soviet Union, across a
wide spectrum of levels, and then make our recommendations on that.
But all of this helps, Saul. In my view, all of these things help.
   Q: At what point will you be making some decisions, rather than
simply saying, ``We're looking at these things''?
   President Bush: Well, we just take our time and do what I think
is handle the overall Soviet relationship in a prudent way. And we _
I think we are doing that. And so it's just _ I can't put a
timeframe on it for you, but I would concur that all of these things
help.
   Charles. And then Craig.
   Q: Mr. President, I'd like to you back Maureen's question. As we
understand, there's been some increased security for your family,
for other officials. But are you concerned that this ``drug war'' is
now going to enter the United States, that there has been an
escalation _ not merely a threat, but a potential danger here?
   President Bush: I don't think there has been, in the hard
intelligence sense, an increase in the threat. There are people who
are concerned. They're concerned in _ obviously in south Florida.
They're concerned in other parts of the country as well.
   But I would cite the _ I would go back to when it was apparent
that Libya was exporting state-sponsored terrorism, perhaps more
than they're now doing. And there was a concern then about the lives
of Americans in our country. And so I can't say I'm totally
unconcerned, but I can't give you any hard evidence that should
further alarm the American people in this regard. Did I leave out
something?
   Q: Well, I don't know. Did you leave out something?
   President Bush: I can't remember. I mean, did you leave out
something? You weren't clear on the question. Put it that _
   Q: I can't _ I suppose the logical follow-on is: Have additional
specific steps been taken to ensure that it won't come into this
country?
   President Bush: Well, I think we're _ I don't know of any
additional specific steps along the border, but we have tried at
every turn to step up our interdiction, and we are doing a better
job now, I can tell you, than we were a year ago, in coordinating
intelligence, which would be probably the key area there, but not as
a result of the _ I can't think of any two or three specific things
done, at least that have come to my attention since the crackdown by
President Barco, if that was the question.
   Yeah, Craig?

   Rafael M. Estevez's hobby again became his
work Monday when Hurricane Hugo cut communications in the Caribbean,
turning ham radio operators into key sources of information for the
islands.
   During such emergencies, his home serves as base for a network of
ham radio operators helping people contact relatives and relaying
emergency information.
   ``I like this because I can help my community, my friends and
people I don't know,'' Estevez said.
   When Hugo left communications dependent on Estevez and other ham
radio operators, reporters descended on his home and television
camera cables snaked through his front door and across the living
room floor.
   Estevez, seated at a desk topped with ham radio equipment and two
telephones, gave live broadcasts in Spanish for several television
stations on the latest damage reports from notes he had jotted on a
pad.
   In the community of Arroyo on Puerto Rico's southeastern coast,
the mayor and several dozen other people stayed in a
theater-turned-shelter after Hugo passed because most homes were
destroyed and power lines lying in the streets made travel
dangerous, Estevez reported.
   A huge wave, about 30 feet high, reportedly struck the village's
beach, he said.
   The islands of Vieques and Culebra off the eastern end of Puerto
Rico were ``severely pounded'' by Hugo with wind reported up to 135
mph, he said.
   ``There's a lot of roofless houses,'' he said.
   Estevez is president and founder of the International Society of
Radio Amateurs, with members in Central America and South America.
Plaques on his wall praise the group's work, including transmitting
information during the United States' invasion of Grenada.
   Estevez works at Hialeah Park Race Track taking bets and does
racetrack publicity for the Spanish-speaking media, but said he is
excused from work during emergencies like Hugo.
   A fellow ham radio operator, Robert Pastor, fielded phone calls
while pressing Estevez to eat a late lunch.
   Estevez, 50, recalled other disasters, including the 1972
Nicaraguan earthquake. He said radio operators serve as a vital link
for people trying to contact relatives in disaster-struck areas.
   ``Earthquakes, you get more victims than hurricanes,'' he said.
``Hurricanes, you get less victims but more damage.''
   Ham radio operator Bernard ``Bob'' Sternberg of Sunrise also
relayed information Monday. He said he transmitted assistance
requests for the eastern Caribbean island of Montserrat to the Red
Cross in Washington, and talked to a St. Croix ham radio operator
who described ``utter destruction'' on that island.
   Sternberg said he spoke early Monday to a ham radio operator on a
boat anchored in a mangrove swamp at Vieques. He said the operator
told him there was ``no wind, no rain and he knew he was in the eye
of the storm,'' and said he was making preparations for the full
brunt of the hurricane.
   ``He asked us to pray for him and we did,'' Sternberg said. ``We
prayed for all of them.''

   Q: (We've been ?) pressing the Soviet Union for so many years to
allow unfettered Jewish emigration. Do you think the United States
in good conscience can set a limit on the number of Soviet Jews that
are allowed to come here, and does this _ and does the current
decision to set some limits have anything to do with Israel's view
that not enough Soviet Jews want to go there?
   President Bush: Well, first, Israel does want as many as possible
to go there. There's no question about that. But I think we can
accommodate those that _ certainly that have applied.
   And yes, we do have to set our _ you know, to control our overall
immigration policy. I mean, we had that at the time of the boat
people; we have it in Brownsville, Texas; we have it in people
coming from other countries, from all across South America wanting
to come here.
   The British are facing this problem now in Hong Kong in a very
serious way. And any country must set its _ set certain limits. It
speaks very well, I think, in terms of what's happening in the
Soviet Union, and hopefully in the way we're handling the Soviet
account, that more and more people are being permitted to come here.
   Q: But you don't feel any sort of moral imperative after the
United States has pressed the Soviet Union for so long to have an
almost open immigration policy to Soviet Jews?
   President Bush: Well, I'd like to have an open immigration policy
for Vietnamese refugees, for those fleeing the tyranny in Nicaragua,
but we can't do that. We have to have a certain control of our own
policy.
   I remember feeling this way at the time of the Mariel boat lift.
And so I know where my heart is, and I'm very proud that this moved
up from, what, 3,000 emigres in one year to now 50,000 or 70,000,
Bob? Somewhere in that range. And that's good. And I want to do
whatever we can to encourage it.
   But, P.S., we have got to have an overall immigration policy that
keeps the control of our demagraphics in our hands.
   Yeah, one and then two over here.
   Q: Mr. President, is there any progress to report on negotiations
with Congress on the drug bill? And would you be willing to put more
money into the drug war as a _ in a possible compromise?
   President Bush: There may be a compromise in the Senate, and I
hope there is. And I've been one who is chastised for too much
compromise from time to time. But I'm not in a position that there
will never be any compromise.
   I am in a posture of saying we've allocated the right amount of
resources, let's get on with doing with what I have suggested, and
then if there's some glaring holes in the program, fine. But to jump
out immediately and start yelling _ not had I gotten off that
television set than a voice comes on from the Democratic side
talking about more money. And then you hear this hue and cry about
raising people's taxes. We don't have to do that.
   We've allocated a proper amount of money, and do I wish there
were more that would be readily available and painless? Absolutely.
But we've now fit a program, a national drug strategy, put _ fit it
in to what I think is a sound financial proposition.
   And therefore, I'd like to urge the Congress to get on with it.
The American people want action. They support strongly our national
drug strategy. I haven't seen one single piece of evidence that they
don't. And so, let's take a step instead of criticizing every time
you come out with a proposal. Whether it's on clean air or something
else, somebody wants to raise taxes and add more money to it. Well,
I can understand that reflex, but I think we ought to try now to
move some of these things forward in the last days of this Congress.
   And there are several other _ a crime package and some of these
areas that I think they could move fast on. I'm very pleased _ Bill
Reilly telling me that the House is starting to mark up our
environmental package. That's good.
   So I don't want to be hypercritical, but I must say there's a
certain frustration level when you come out with a sound program and
two answers come out: spend more and raise taxes. And that, I don't
think we have to do to be sound in the environment or sound in
education or sound in narcotics.
   Q: Follow-up?
   President Bush: Yeah. Anti-narcotics. Follow-up.
   Q: Mr. President, today Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney said US
troops should be used more in the drug war, and that they would, in
fact, be put in harm's way. Is that what you foresee?
   President Bush: You know what I learned long ago? Don't answer
from one sentence out of something that somebody said that I haven't
seen. But I've stated my position on trying to support Colombia, but
I just would get in real trouble if I commented, even though I'm
sure you accurately reflected what he said, or tried to. But he
hasn't _ (laughter) _ put it this way _ put it this way: He hasn't
discussed it with me. Something of this nature, I'm sure he would.

<TEXT>
   Yeah?
   Q: Mr. President, the earlier question on the meetings with Mr.
Shevardnadze you answered and you couched your responses in terms of
responding, reacting, to what he brings. Can you talk for a second
about what you want them to react to? What is your agenda? What do
you want to get out of those meetings?
   President Bush: Well, we've got some of our agenda on the public
table, as you know. The most pressing point, the conventional
forces, that agreement, that would really be a wonderful step to see
completed fairly soon. But there will be other issues that Baker
will be raising, Secretary Baker will be raising with them, a wide
array of them.
   They will be on their economy, they will be on the environment,
they will be on _ well, several others that I _ I touched on
chemical. I don't know exactly how far along we're going to be by
the time that meeting starts, but we're not going to just react to
his proposals. We're going to be very interested in them and welcome
them, but we just simply cannot and will not keep reacting.
   We have interests in this hemisphere, where the Soviets
continuing to send or increased amounts of arms going into Nicaragua
right now over last year. That's not very good, and it's not a very
kind and gentle approach to this hemisphere. And so we're going to
be raising other questions with them. But I think it will be a
constructive meeting and hope there will be progress.
   Staff: You have to go, sir.
   President Bush: All right. Here it is.
   Q: Mr. President, Vice President Quayle has indicated in a recent
statement that the administration may be either reevaluating or
backing off on its commitment to SDI. What's going on with SDI?
   President Bush: We're not backing off it. We submitted some
figures up there, and, lo and behold, they were cut, or trying to be
cut, and so we will stay with it.
   But I think what the Vice President was talking about was SDI, as
now constituted, opposed to the original broad, idealistic, and _
wonderfully idealistic, proposal of an impenetrable shield. I think
what Dan Quayle was doing was focusing it down more, where the
research would go more along the lines it is now, and _ but with the
shield proposal kind of set aside. I think that's what that was all
about. All right, persistence pays off. Not yours _ his. (Laughter.)
   Q: I wonder if you could go back to the question of Soviet Jewish
immigration. It's understandable that nations must set limits and
control their immigration but when we thought that there was a real
need the space was there. I wonder if you feel that the need is
diminished? I wonder if you feel that there is no longer the threat
to Jews in the Soviet Union?
   President Bush: I'd have to say I think the climate is better,
but I can't say there's no threat to employment, to _ you know
sometimes when you file an application to leave the Soviet Union
you're automatically denied employment. Sometimes your apartment and
wherever it might be.
   So, I think things are improving but I think as long as someone
is held in a country against their will because they can't get out,
it is a matter of human concern, it is a matter of conscience that
was summed up in the _ really in the Helsinki Accords. And so it's,
it's not just _ it's not just the, the Jews coming out of the Soviet
Union. It's a very important category but there are others around
the world that are seeking refuge as well.
   So it _ I think things are somewhat better there, but I don't
think we can say, ``Look, you've totally lived up to your, to your
commitment for ingress and egress by permitting, what, 70,000 people
to leave.'' I mean I've heard figures as high as half a million
wanting to leave the Soviet Union. So we can't relax on that but we
do have to do it in an orderly _ immigration _ have an orderly
immigration policy. Thank you all for your understanding.
   We didn't get _ is there _ may I ask if there's a question from a
Montana. Frank, you are not a Montana reporter. (Laughter.) Please,
sir.
   Q: You didn't mention anything about wilderness in your talk on
environmental stewardship. A big issue in Montana and most of the
other Western states is whether to add additional wilderness areas
to the National Wilderness (?). What's your position on that?
   President Bush: My position is that we can accommodate _ first
let me give you a broad answer. We can accommodate sound
environmental practice with some growth. And the governor of the
state feels that way. We did talk about it in the _ earlier on.
   We have made proposals for more wilderness to be set aside, and I
can't help you with exactly what's happening in Montana on that, I'm
sorry. But, I don't _ you know, I'm one who campaigned on and still
feels that you can have good, strong, sound environmental practice
without saying there will no growth whatsoever. Or no energy
industry whatsoever. So, whether that helps or not _ but I'm just
not familiar with the numbers of acreage being requested here in
this state.
   OK, thank you all very much.

   The death toll from a shooting rampage at
a printing plant rose to nine Monday with the death of a plant
worker who was wounded. Four other victims were buried Monday.
   Kenneth Fentress of Louisville died about 5 p.m. Monday, said a
spokeswoman at Humana Hospital University. Fentress, 45, suffered
gunshot wounds to the chest and leg during last Thursday's rampage.
   He was one of 13 wounded when Joseph T. Wesbecker sprayed the
Standard Gravure Corp. printing plant with gunfire from an AK-47
rifle. Wesbecker, who then killed himself, had been on permanent
disability leave from the plant for the past year because of mental
illness.
   Meanwhile, two anti-gun organizations, hoping to mobilize a
grassroots movement in the wake of the shootings, placed ads in a
statewide newspaper Monday to enlist support to ban various weapons.
   In a related development, the gun shop owner in Louisville who
sold Wesbecker the AK-47 and a MAC-11 pistol said he has decided to
quit ordering the semiautomatic weapons for customers.
   ``The weapons are so controversial right now that we just don't
want to fool with them any longer,'' said Jack Tilford, owner of
Tilford's Gun Sales.
   President Bush has banned the import of foreign-made assault
rifles into the United States, including the AK-47. However,
possession of these weapons is not a federal offense, nor does the
import ban prevent them from being manufactured domestically.
   A full-page ad in The Courier-Journal from the Louisville Council
on Peacemaking and Religion called for the abolition of assault
weapons, saying ``there is no compelling reason'' to possess ``these
terrible instruments.''
   Readers were asked to send the ad to U.S. Sens. Wendell Ford,
D-Ky, and Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.
   ``I'm deeply disturbed by the recent outbreaks of violence in our
state, and believe we must take action to stop such vicious
crimes,'' McConnell said. But he added: ``We need to be careful
about legislating in the middle of a crisis.''
   McConnell referred to a police standoff Monday in which a
17-year-old armed teen-ager held 11 classmates at a high school in
McKee. The boy later released the hostages and surrendered.
   Ford will consider the group's views when gun-control legislation
comes before the full Senate, said his spokeswoman, Susan Elmendorf.
   The Handgun Control Inc. placed an in the Louisville newspaper
featuring Sarah Brady, wife of former presidential press secretary
James Brady, who was critically injured in the attempted
assassination of President Reagan in 1981.
   Funerals in the print shop shootings were held Monday for William
S. Ganote Sr., 46; Paul S. Sallee, 60; James G. ``Buck'' Husband,
47; and Lloyd R. White, 42.

   The National Aeronautics and Space
Administration said Monday it may roll the space shuttle Atlantis
back from its seaside launch pad at the Kennedy Space Center in
Florida if hurricane Hugo continues to pose a threat.
   NASA spokeswoman Sarah Keegan said preparations also were being
made to remove a satellite from an Atlas-Centaur rocket which had
been scheduled for launch on Friday.
   She said a final decision was to be made Tuesday morning on both
space vehicles after a weather briefing.
   Atlantis is scheduled to be launched Oct. 12 with the Galileo
space probe in its cargo bay. The five astronauts on the flight are
to release the probe and send it on a six-year voyage to the planet
Jupiter.
   The space probe is powered by a small nuclear generator.
   ``We are starting preparations'' to pull Atlantis back into the
relative safety of its hangar in the giant Vehicle Assembly
Building, Miss Keegan said. ``We decided to take preliminary steps
if they decide to roll back tomorrow.''
   A return to the hangar would certainly mean a delay in the
launch, but NASA has an opportunity to send the probe on its way
until late November.
   The payload on top of the Atlas-Centaur rocket is the last of a
series of communications satellites for the Navy.
   On Monday, the hurricane hit Puerto Rico with 125 mph winds, as
it moved across islands in the eastern Caribbean, killing 14 people
and leaving thousands homeless.
   By evening on Monday the center of the hurricane was 90 miles
northwest of San Juan and was moving at 13 mph in a direction
varying from west-northwest to northwest.
   Forecasters have said it was too early to tell whether the
hurricane would strike the U.S. mainland.

   President Bush, amid reports that he has
ordered stepped-up security for his family, said Monday he has no
``hard intelligence'' about threats from drug lords and any such
attacks would provoke the ``entire wrath'' of the American people
   ``I can't say I'm totally unconcerned, but I don't have any hard
evidence that should further alarm the American people in this
context,'' he said at a news conference in Helena, Mont. on a
two-day swing through the West.
   ``I know there's speculation on this, but there is no hard
intelligence evidence of such targeting,'' when asked if he knew of
threats against his family. ``Clearly any such action would I think
just bring down the entire wrath of the American people and the
American government.''
   Earlier, Bush's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, declined comment on
what type of Secret Service protection was afforded the five grown
Bush children. ``We don't comment on security, period,'' he said.
   On Friday, the Secret Service beefed up security for Dorothy Bush
LeBlond, the president's daughter who lives near Portland, Maine and
works for the Portland Chamber of Commerce.
   Neither Secret Service spokesman Robert Snow nor authorities in
Portland would say specifically why the action was taken. But local
police said they were notified of the service's plan to increase
security for Mrs. LeBlond before five Colombian men were arrested
with a large arsenal of firearms in Canada near the Maine border
last Wednesday.
   Newsweek magazine reported in this week's editions that Bush had
ordered 24-hour Secret Service protection for his children at the
recommendation of the agency.
   Mrs. LeBlond, who is separated from the husband and has two
children, and her brothers and sisters did not respond to telephone
calls. The other children are Jeb in Miami, George Jr., in Dallas,
Neil in Denver and Marvin in Alexandria, Va.
   Allan Kramer, another Secret Service spokesman, said the
president and his family are authorized to receive round-the-clock
protection.
   Kramer would not provide any details of security for the Bush
children, but a White House source who spoke on condition on
anonymity said the children were not guarded on a regular basis in
the past.
   Kramer said presidential children do not always want protection.
For instance, former President Reagan's children were not happy
about full-time agents in their lives so Reagan signed an ordered
relinquishing protection for some of them.

<HEAD>Hungary's Communists, Opposition Sign Political Agreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hungary's ruling Communist Party and
five opposition groups signed an agreement late Monday on measures
to go before Parliament aimed at achieving peaceful transition to a
multiparty system.
   According to Hungarian television, majority agreement was reached
on a constitutional reform, establishment of a constitutional court,
the functioning of political parties and a draft electoral law.
   Negotiators also agreed on a reform of the penal code and an
amendment to the law on criminal procedure.
   The items of legislation will be submitted to Parliament, which
convenes on Sept. 26.
   Four opposition groups _ the League of Free Democrats, the League
of Young Democrats, the League of Independent Democratic Trade
Unions and the Hungarian Social Democratic Party _ did not sign the
agreement, but said they won't stand in the way of Parliament's
working on the bills.
   The agreement specified that political bargaining would continue
on issues not resolved.
   According to the state news agency MTI, these include the
technical aspects of electing the president of the republic; a new
law on information; issues related to transforming the workers'
militia, now a paramilitary group, and ruling out violent means to
solve political issues.
   In addition to the communists and opposition groups, the talks
were attended by social organizations, including the official trade
unions.
   In a major concession announced earlier, the Hungarian Socialist
Workers Party, or the Communist Party, agreed to give $36 million to
the government by the end of the year to be used to finance
opposition political parties.
   MTI said agreement was reached that the president will be chosen
by referendum this year, but should be selected by Parliament once
free elections have been held.
   After the constitutional amendment is enacted, the current
Presidential Council will be dissolved and its duties assumed by the
speaker of Parliament until a new president is elected. The
11-member council is empowered to exercise the functions of
Parliament when Parliament is not in session.
   A major opposition demand was disbanding the workers' militia, an
organization set up in 1957 by the communist party to safeguard its
rule.
   The communists tried to defuse the issue on Monday by offering to
slash the 60,000-member militia's strength by a third and put it
under Defense Ministry supervision, but this apparently was not
enough.

   Senate Democrats and Republicans searched for a
compromise Monday in their struggle over the size and shape of an
anti-drug package as President Bush stood by his $7.9 billion
proposal as sufficient to do the job.
   Lawmakers from both parties met for two hours Monday evening
without settling any of the differences between them, and said they
would resume their talks Tuesday.
   ``We on our side of the table are still waiting for our friends
on the other side of the table to come up with what they would
consider a counter-proposal,'' said Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., after
the meeting.
   ``If we are talking about a specific plan on the Republican side,
it is the president's plan,'' said the chief Republican negotiator,
Sen. Mark Hartfield of Oregon.
   Byrd, backed by Democratic leaders, offered legislation last week
doubling Bush's proposal to increase financing for anti-drug
initiatives by $2.2 billion. Both sides believe that illegal drugs,
and the crime and violence springing from them, are the top issue on
the minds of the public.
   Bush is asking for $7.9 billion, mostly for law enforcement, for
fiscal 1990, which begins Oct. 1. Byrd's $10.1 billion package puts
more emphasis than Bush hasd on prevention and treatment efforts.
   For his part, the president told a news conference in Helena,
Mont., ``We've allocated the right amount of money. ... I'd like to
urge the Congress to get on with it. The American people want
action.''
   As for raising taxes to finance the war on drugs, Bush said, ``We
don't have to do that.''
   Although defending his proposal, Bush indicated he was willing to
compromise with Democrats on the final shape of an anti-drug program.
   ``There may be a compromise in the Senate and I hope there is,''
the president said. Still, he complained that the initial Democratic
response was ``spend more and raise taxes.''
   As written, Byrd's proposal drew an immediate veto threat from
White House officials, who complained that it was too expensive.
They also objected to its formula for providing the extra money:
cutting most other federal programs by 0.575 percent, which results
in a $1.8 billion slash in the military's $300 billion budget.
   The two sides have been bargaining since last week, with
Republicans hoping to reduce the size of the package, shift more of
its resources to law enforcement agencies, and shield the Pentagon
from cuts.
   Because of the standoff, Republicans on Monday slowed the
Senate's work on the remaining five annual spending bills to operate
the government next year. They fear that the chamber's Democratic
majority will leave the Pentagon spending bill for last, leaving it
vulnerable to cuts to finance anti-drug efforts.
   Debate on a $67.2 billion measure for housing, veterans and space
programs began in the late afternoon _ three hours behind schedule _
but Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said he might block
a vote on final passage.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, chided the GOP
for blocking the bills. He noted that in the past, then-President
Reagan and other Republicans have lambasted congressional Democrats
for failing to approve spending legislation on time.
   ``No useful purpose would be served'' by blocking the bills,
Mitchell said. ``No political purpose, no substantive purpose.''
   Congress has so far sent only one of the 13 annual appropriations
bills for fiscal 1990 to Bush for his signature.

   France assigned 3,000 soldiers and military transports to aid
hurricane-ravaged Guadeloupe on Monday and a British warship put
ashore a landing party to help the residents of Montserrat.
   In the United States, voluntary relief organizations asked for
donations to help storm victims including those in Puerto Rico, a
U.S. commonwealth, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
   New York City's Puerto Rican community began raising funds to
provide aid. The Department of Puerto Rican Community Affairs, a New
York City-based organization run by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,
was coordinating the citywide effort of churches, banks and
individuals interested in helping the disaster relief effort.
   No U.S. federal aid was being sent to Pureto Rican or the U.S.
Virgin islands either because airports were closed or no formal
request for assistance has been received.
   ``There's not much we can do,'' said Bill McAda, a spokesman for
the Federal Emergency Management Agency. `Under law we have to have
a request from one or both governors (of Puerto Rica and the Virgin
Islands) for presidential action.''
   The French Defense Ministry in Paris announced it has assigned
3,000 soldiers, two military transport aircraft and four cargo
vessels to help restore communications and emergency services to
Guadeloupe, a French overseas territory.
   It said the troops and equipment will come from the regional
Antilles-Guyana command and the planes and ships will ferry medical
and radio equipment, building materials and aid workers to the
island.
   The government also alerted French ships in the Caribbean to be
ready to render assistance in rescue operations while the state
airline Air France lowered fares to and from Guadeloupe and
scheduled more cargo flights.
   Two aircraft arrived Monday at Point-a-Pitre, Guadeloupe, from
France, the first since Friday, and they delivered 45 tons of
emergency supplies and 200 rescue workers.
   Britain reported the Royal Navy warship Alacrity had a 150-member
landing party standing by to go ashore in Montserrat.
   It said a 16-member working party landed Monday to clear debris
from the airport and other members of the landing party will go
ashore Tuesday to help restore comunications and other facilities.
   A spokesman for the Overseas Development Administration in London
said: ``The frigate has landed some basic medical supplies and they
have sent some men ashore to clear the runway to enable further
supplies to be flown in'' to the British island.
   British Airways said Monday night that it was sending two Boeing
747 jumbo jets to Antigua Tuesday to evacuate up to 400 people from
the island. The Caribbean nation of Antigua and Barbuda is in the
British-led Commonwealth.
   A British Defense Ministry said the Alacrity had radioed that its
medical officer, flown to Montserrat by helicopter, reported 80
percent of the island's buildings were flattened.
   The Philadelphia-based American Friends Service Committee
announced it was accepting donations to aid hurricane victims.
   Paul Brink, information director, said the funds would be used
for emergency relief and reconstruction and will be administered
through the Caribbean Project for Justice and Peace.
   In Washington, an organization of voluntary relief agencies urged
aid donors to provide cash rather than goods.
   It said it made the appeal for cash donations to avoid problems
that occurred in recent disasters when relief agencies were flooded
with unneeded goods that hampered delivery of necessary items.
   ``Goods should not be collected or sent unless they have been
requested by the disaster-stricken country or private voluntary
organizations,'' said InterAction.
   InterAction represents about 120 relief organizations including
the American Red Cross, CARE, Save the Children, World Vision, Oxfam
and the Christian Children's Fund.

<HEAD>43rd General Assembly Closes; Highlight Was `End to Cold War'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The yearlong 43rd General Assembly ended
Monday, a session that saw ``the end of the Cold War'' declared by
Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev, said Assembly President Dante
Caputo.
   Before his presidential term ended in January, Reagan joined the
Soviet president in opening a new era of warmer superpower
relations, which was reflected in the speeches both men gave to the
General Assembly almost a year ago.
   Caputo said those declarations ``are the deepest and most
eloquent reflection of profound change that has occurred.
   ``They demonstrate, I would venture to say, the end of the Cold
War, which hovered over our world for such a long period.''
   Monday's brief closing session was mainly procedural. Unresolved
questions such as the Palestinian issue, Cyprus and the uneasy
Iran-Iraq truce were carried over to the 44th General Assembly,
which opens Tuesday.
   The assembly took the unprecedented step of moving to Geneva to
hear Yasser Arafat last December after the State Department refused
to give Palestine Liberation Organization chief an entry visa to
address the General Assembly.
   At Geneva, Arafat renounced the use of terrorism and recognized
Israel's right to exist, eliminating the major issues that prompted
the State Department to refuse his visa request.
   Arafat has said he would like to address this year's General
Assembly.
   Arab League Ambassador Clovis Maksoud said he was confident the
new U.S. administration would grant a visa if one was asked, but if
not, ``of course we would want to go back to Geneva.''
   The undersecretary-general for General Assembly affairs, Ronald
Spiers, told reporters Arafat should be allowed to speak if he
wishes.
   Spiers is a former undersecretary at the State Department and the
top American official at the United Nations.
   Caputo, Argentina's former foreign minister, reviewed the closing
assembly's major accomplishments.
   He noted it set in motion Namibia's transition toward
independence, which may end in the sovereign nation of Namibia's
becoming the 160th member of the General Assembly next year.
   Caputo hailed the unanimous adoption of the Afghanistan
resolution that called for outside parties not to interfere in
Afghan affairs, and for a government of national reconciliation.
   Other landmark resolutions included calls for peace settlements
in Central America, Western Sahara and Cambodia.
   ``This, more than any other time, is the time of the United
Nations. As the Cold War yields to dialogue and detente, new
possibilities are opened for the collective security enshrined in
our Charter,'' said Caputo.

   Rocket and artillery barrages blasted
Beirut on Monday after Christian army commander Michel Aoun rejected
a proposed committee to monitor a cease-fire in his 6-month-old war
against Syrian troops.
   Police said the exchanges at times averaged 20 shells a minute
and that at least six people were killed and 14 wounded.
   That brought the toll to 921 killed and 2,713 wounded since March
8, when the confrontation began between Gen. Aoun's estimated 20,000
troops and Syria's 40,000 soldiers.
   Concentrated shelling of the Shiite Moslem slum of Haret Hreik
demolished a seven-story apartment building. A police spokesman said
three bodies were found in the rubble of the Mokdad building, seven
people were wounded and three more were missing and feared dead
under the debris. He said the building collapsed while its
inhabitants were waiting out the shelling in the basement.
   Rescue workers hanging from ropes pulled a bloodied woman from
the basement. She apparently survived.
   The spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the duels
broke out around 1 a.m., 90 minutes hours after Aoun announced in a
televised interview his rejection of a security committee proposed
by Arab mediators Saturday. He wants at least one Syrian committee
member.
   ``I won't accept at all a Lebanese-Lebanese committee. This is
what the Syrians wanted to deceive the world and say the clashes
have been among Lebanese factions,'' Aoun said.
   In Damascus, the Syrian capital, U.S. Ambassador Edward Djerdjian
urged the Lebanese ``to demonstrate flexibility.''
   The British Foreign Office expressed support for the Arab
initiative and said ``an immediate and comprehensive cease-fire
throughout Lebanon'' should be the first step.
   And in an extraordinary burst of optimism, the Arab League's
ambassador to the United Nations, Clovis Maksoud, said on Monday
that Lebanon's long nightmare ``is on the brink of resolution.''
   Arab League envoy Lakhdar al-Ibrahimi of Algeria, the Arab
mediators' choice to lead the proposed committee, met with Aoun for
an hour at the general's bomb-ravaged presidential palace in
suburban Baabda.
   He said later, ``We discussed ways of implementing the Arab
committee's decisions.''
   Why Aoun's gunners concentrated on Haret Hreik was not explained.
The densely populated slum is a stronghold of the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God. The Syrians have no firing positions
there.
   A bulldozer sifted part of the rubble, enabling rescuers with
flashlights to climb down on ropes into the basement of the Mokdad
building.
   One worker shouted: ``A survivor! A survivor!'' Rescuers rushed
in with a stretcher and a blanket and pulled through a hole an
unconscious woman covered with blood.
   ``She's alive! Allah akbar (God is great)!,'' rescuers shouted as
they put her into an ambulance.
   The Arab committee _ made up of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, King
Hassan II of Morocco and President Chadli Bendjedid of Algeria _
announced a peace plan Saturday.
   In calls for a cease-fire and a security committee and urges
Parliament to meet on Sept. 30 to discuss political reforms, the
Moslems' condition for ending the 14-year-old civil war.
   The Syrian-backed Moslems want to share power equally with the
Christians, who have dominated the government, legislature, army and
judiciary since independence from France in 1943.
   The Christians then were the majority, but Moslems now comprise
55 percent of the 4 million population.
   On Sunday night, Aoun ruled out talk of political reform until
Lebanon is ``free of all occupations.''
   He was referring to Syria's 40,000 troops _ in Lebanon under a
1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate _ and an Israeli force, which
has controlled a border strip in south Lebanon since 1985.
   U.S. Ambassador Djerdjian told reporters in Damascus:
   ``There's no way out of the Lebanese civil war except through a
political solution, and the withdrawal of all foreign forces,
including Israel's.
   ``The Arab League proposal is worthy of the support of the
Lebanese people,'' he said, indirectly criticizing Aoun's
reservations.
   Aoun has accused the United States of turning a blind eye to
Syria's war against the traditionally pro-Western Christians.
   Washington withdrew its embassy staff from Christian east Beirut
this month after Aoun's supporters besieged the compound demanding
U.S. support.

   Tropical Storm Iris gathered 50 mph winds in the
wake of Hurricane Hugo on Monday and forecasters warned residents on
the already battered Leeward Islands to keep a close watch on its
progress.
   At 6 p.m. EDT Monday, a U.S. Air Force reconnaissance aircraft
and satellite pictures located the center of the tropical storm near
16.5 north latitude and 56.5 west longitude, or about 300 miles east
of the Leeward Islands, a group of islands in the Lesser Antilles of
the West Indies.
   The governments of Barbados, St. Vincent and St. Lucia issued
warnings for Iris, the ninth named storm of this Atlantic hurricane
season.
   Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables said
Iris was moving toward the north-northwest at about 18 mph.
   Swirling weather patterns left behind by Hugo made further
strengthening unlikely through Tuesday evening, said hurricane
specialist Gil Clark. Iris was expected to hold its course at a
slightly slower pace during that time.
   Tropical depressions become tropical storms when their top
sustained winds reach 39 mph. Iris became a storm Sunday.

<TEXT>
   Hungary and Israel restored full
diplomatic ties Monday, more than 20 years after Budapest severed
them to protest Israel's occupation of Arab lands in the 1967 Middle
East war.
   Hungary becomes the first East bloc nation to renew full ties
with the Jewish state. Romania was the only Warsaw Pact nation to
maintain ties following the 1967 war.
   The move underlined the Budapest government's determination to
continue its increasingly independent foreign policy and its opening
to the West.
   It also reflected a warming of relations between Israel and the
Soviet Union. Moscow led the East bloc in severing ties with Israel
in 1967, but in recent years there have been gradual steps toward
the re-establishment of ties. Those steps have included cultural
exchanges and the establishment of low-level diplomatic contacts.
   Hungary's official news agency MTI announced the resumption of
ties shortly after Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens arrived in
Budapest for an official visit.
   The renewal of ties has ``historic significance'' because Hungary
was the site of thriving Jewish communities until the Holocaust in
World War II, Arens said on Israel radio from Budapest.
   ``These ties will bring economic, social and political benefits
to Israel and also to Hungary,'' the Russian-born Arens added.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, also speaking on Israel
radio, termed the Hungarian move ``a courageous and strong decision
to be pioneers in the field.'' He said he hoped other Soviet bloc
states would follow suit.
   The Soviet Union and other Warsaw Pact allies were informed by
Hungary of the move, said Laszlo Kovacs, a state secretary in the
foreign ministry.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
said, ``We are pleased they have decided to restore formal
diplomatic relations. We hope that other members of the Warsaw Pact
will follow Hungary's lead.''
   About 80,000 Jews live in Hungary, giving it Eastern Europe's
second largest Jewish community. The Soviet Union is first with 2.5
million. Before the Nazi Holocaust, about 1 million Jews lived in
Hungary.
   Hungary, which has embraced liberal social reforms and plans
multiparty elections next year, has angered hard-line Warsaw Pact
allies by opening its border to Austria, allowing thousands of East
Germans to flee to the West.
   Foreign Minister Gyula Horn told MTI the resumption of ties after
22 years marked another step in Hungary's reform drive, and an
attempt to correct what he termed past mistakes.
   ``Hungary is against confrontation, endorses dialogue and wants
good relationships based on mutual advantages,'' Horn was quoted as
saying.
   ``This step is not aimed against anybody and will probably be
helpful in solving the Middle East conflict,'' he added.
   The protocol on the resumption of ties was signed by Arens and
Horn.
   In September 1987, Hungary and Israel agreed to establish
interest sections in each others' countries. Israel also has an
interest section in Poland.
   Under Monday's agreement, the head of Israel's Interest Office in
Budapest, Shlomo Meron, turns ambassador. Hungary's corresponding
office in Tel Aviv also becomes an embassy, Israel's Foreign
Ministry said.
   MTI said the ties between the two countries were never totally
cut, ``especially because there are about 300,000 Israeli citizens
whose mother tongue is Hungarian, but what was left of trade went
through intermediaries.''
   Four weeks ago, the World Jewish Congress said Hungary had begun
allowing Soviet Jews to fly to Israel through Budapest, becoming the
second East European country to permit the transit of such
immigrants. Romania has been allowing Soviet Jews to transit through
Bucharest for several years.
   Bilateral trade increased after the interest sections were opened
in March 1988. The Israeli airline, El Al, and the Hungarian carrier
Malev started flights between Budapest and Tel Aviv in October.
   In July, an agreement went into force on the mutual reduction of
customs tariffs between the two countries, covering an equal number
of 16 types of goods on both sides. The reduction applies to roughly
one-third of Hungarian exports to Israel.
   At the end of June, the Israeli Trade Ministry lifted special
import licensing obligations, thus giving Hungary the same treatment
that countries of the European Free Trade Association enjoy.

   Bush, who sees Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze later
this week, said he felt ``under no rush'' to arrange a summit with
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and does not see ``any
insurmountable stumbling blocks'' to an arms control agreement. The
president noted an increased flow of Soviet-bloc arms from Cuba to
Nicaragua, called it ``not a very kind and gentle approach to this
hemisphere'' and said he would take it up with Shevardnadze.

the White House over budget matters if a proposal to cut the capital
gains tax is approved. ``This idea that we won't talk _ I don't
think that's right and I don't think the American people would
support that,'' Bush said.

   An armed teen-ager apparently acting out the
scenario to a Stephen King novel stalked into a high school
classroom and took 11 classmates hostage Monday. After a daylong
standoff, he released them all and surrendered.
   No one was injured in the confrontation, which began about 9:50
a.m. and ended at 6:35 p.m., police said. The youth fired two shots,
one at the ceiling of the classroom and another at a window, state
police said.
   The teen-ager, whose only request to police was to speak to his
father, told his hostages he did not want to hurt anyone. The final
two hostages were freed shortly after 5 p.m. EDT, and the youth gave
up an hour and a half later, authorities said.
   The hostage-taker was identified by police as Dustin Pierce, a
17-year-old senior at Jackson County High School who was described
as a good student.
   Police said they were unsure what charges would be lodged against
Pierce. He was taken to a juvenile holding center in the Clay County
Jail in nearby Manchester. McKee is a town of 250 people about 50
miles southeast of Lexington in the Appalachian foothills.
   ``He was unbalanced,'' said state police Detective Bob Stephens,
who negotiated with Pierce throughout the day at the high school.
``He was a confused young man. He was a young man looking for
somebody to help him.''
   Throughout the negotiations, Stephens said he feared Pierce would
try to kill himself since he seemed to be carrying out the scenario
of the Stephen King thriller ``Rage,'' which he had been reading.
   During a search of Pierce's room at home, police found a
paperback copy of the book, in which the lead character is shot by
police. The book tells the story of a high school boy who hates his
father and begins bringing his father's pistol to school.
Eventually, the lead character in the story takes a class of 24
students hostage and kills a teacher.
   Police also found papers Pierce had written that made references
to dying at 9 o'clock.
   At one point during the day, ``he said it'll all end at nine,''
Stephens said. Pierce's sole demand throughout was to talk to his
father, Stephens said.
   ``He hasn't seen his father, my understanding, since he's 4 years
old,'' Stephens said.
   Pierce's father, who was not identified, was on his way to McKee
from Delray Beach, Fla., when the student released his last two
hostages and surrendered.
   ``He never would commit to why he wanted to talk to his father,''
Stephens said.
   Psychologists and FBI experts who assisted Stephens pored over
``Rage'' during the day and relayed its details to the negotiators.
After reading the book and Pierce's notes, ``We thought suicide was
what we'd have to deal with at the end,'' Stephens said.
   Stephens said he pressed to end the standoff before the 9 o'clock
time mentioned in the notes. He said Pierce never threatened to harm
anyone else.
   Pierce, who released his hostages throughout the day in exchange
for items such as food, soft drinks and cigarettes, ``said he wasn't
going to hurt nobody,'' according to Craig Eversole, a classmate who
was held but released. ``He said he wasn't going to shoot nobody.''
   Police Trooper Ed Robinson said the hostage-taker was armed with
a shotgun, a .357-caliber Magnum revolver and ``some type of
automatic pistol.'' Eversole identified the other weapons as a
.44-caliber Magnum and a 12-gauge shotgun.
   Robinson also said the teen-ager apparently had held one hostage
overnight _ the son of school Principal Betty Bond. He said the two
boys arrived at school in the younger Bond's red pickup, and it
appeared that the armed youth had been holding the principal's son
since the night before.
   It was not clear why the youth took over the classroom.
Authorities described him as a newcomer to the school who was living
with his grandparents, but some students said they had known him for
years.
   State Police Capt. John Lile said the boy's parents are separated.
   Eversole, a 15-year-old junior, said he was in the classroom when
the armed youth came through the door.
   ``He never said nothing,'' Eversole said. ``He shot the ceiling
and told the teacher to leave and let two rows of students leave.
... He didn't say nothing, why he was doing it or nothing.''
   Later, Pierce fired another shot, blowing out a classroom window
to allow Bond, the original hostage, to get an AM-FM radio and
telephone, Lile said.
   Eversole was released at about 1:30 p.m. after soda was delivered
to the room _ apparently as part of a deal with police.
   Earlier, Robinson said the boy fired one shot at a news
helicopter from WCPO-TV in Cincinnati shortly before 1 p.m. But a
state police spokesman in Frankfort later denied that shots were
fired at the helicopter.
   Nearly 500 other students at the high school were evacuated after
the incident began.
   Valerie Hurst, at the Justice Hurst Funeral Home across the
street from the high school, said students evacuated to her building
were frightened.
   ``We had a couple to pass out and had to call an ambulance for
one who had a heart condition,'' she said.
   She said the boy was described by people she talked to as a good
student.

<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS 3rd graf: ``After the,'' Bush goes to dinner with Foley</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   President Bush defended the slow pace of
arms negotiations with the Soviet Union on Monday, and said ``it's
not time for normalcy'' in relations with China despite a gradual
increase in contacts since June's bloody crackdown on student
dissent in Beijing.
   In a wide-ranging session with reporters in the ornate Senate
chamber of the Montana Legislature, Bush said reforms in Hungary had
made it possible to extend new economic privileges to the Communist
nation.
   After the news conference, the president flew to Spokane, Wash.
and had dinner with House Speaker Thomas S. Foley in Foley's home
district.
   The president was emphasizing environmental issues on a swing
through South Dakota, Montana and Washington, and he defended his
decision not to travel to Alaska to view the oil spill damage in
Prince William Sound.
   He said he was hopeful that ``winter will be kind'' in restoring
environmental conditions in Alaskan waters. He said he'd sent his
``environmental vice president'' to inspect the clean-up efforts and
predicted that Exxon would ``come back'' next spring if further
clean-up was necessary in the wake of the oil spill from the Exxon
Valdez.
   The president also vowed to fight on the floor of the
Democratic-controlled House to win passage of his plan for a cut in
the capital gains tax, and said his plan is ``not as my critics say,
a tax that will help the rich.''
   He also said any attempt by Colombian drug leaders to retaliate
on Americans for the Bush administration's drug program would
``bring down the wrath of the American people and the American
government.''
   Bush fielded several questions on the Soviet Union a few days
before Secretary of State James Baker's scheduled meetings with
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, who has criticized the
administration for not advancing any major proposal on long-range
arms.
   Asked why there hadn't been more progress on a strategic arms
agreement, Bush noted he had put early emphasis on conventional arms.
   He acknowledged rumors that Shevardnadze would bring a new arms
proposal to the United States during meetings later this week, but
said, ``I don't know what he's going to bring. We haven't had that
confirmed.''
   He added, ``I think our handling of the Soviet account is pretty
good ... I think the chief point is does the Soviet Union understand
that we want to see their perestroika succeed and see them move
forward with more liberties and I think they do understand that and
so I don't think there's any chance of a disconnect there.''
   ``These are not easy problems,' Bush said, mentioning
verification issues as among the thorniest to a so-called START pact
limiting long-range ballistic missiles. At the same time, he said,
``don't see any insurmountable stumbling blocks there.'' He said he
was in no hurry to meet personally with Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   ``We do want to move ahead on START,'' Bush said. ``As you know
we came in, did a review, completed the review, and we will be
working inside our own administration to have the proposal that I
think will capture the imagination of the Soviet Union.''
   Among other topics that will be raised, the president mentioned
an increased flow of Soviet bloc arms to Nicaragua _ which officials
have said is coming from Cuba _ and said the shipments were ``not a
very kind and gentle approach to this hemisphere.''
   A reporter noted news accounts that Bush's brother Prescott was
among American merchants who had resumed business contacts with the
Chinese and asked Bush if it were time to resume normal relations.
   Bush responded, ``No, no, we're not'' ready, although he said he
hoped he would soon see ``proper signals'' from the Chinese
leadership that would lead to improved relations.
   On other subjects, he indicated he was willing to compromise with
Democrats in Congress on the final shape of an anti-drug program,
although he complained that their initial response was ``spend more
and raise taxes.''
   _Asked about threats to himself or his family by South American
drug lords bent on revenge for his own drug program, the president
said he didn't know of any ``hard intelligence'' that the danger had
increased.
   _The president said ``Hungary has undertaken major steps toward
economic and political reform,'' enabling the United States to grant
permanent favored-nation status to the Eastern European Communist
state. He said the move ``will open new doors for the Hungarian
economy encouraging greater market orientation and increasing the
foreign exchange earnings.''
   _Bush said he wished the United States could accept as many
Soviet Jews who wished to enter the country but added: ``We do have
to set our, to control our, overall immigration policy. We've had
that in regard to the boat people, we have it in Brownsville,
Texas.''
   Later, when asked if he felt the persecution of Soviet Jews had
abated, the president said, ``I'd have to say I think the climate is
better but I can't say there is no threat. I think things are
improving but I think as long as someone is held in a country
against their will, they can't get out, it is a matter of human
concern.''
   _Bush sidestepped a question of whether he would grant Yasser
Arafat, the leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization, a visa
to attend this month's United Nations General Assembly session. ``I
will consider that matter when and if it comes to my attention,'' he
said.
   Bush was criticized last summer for a measured response to the
Chinese crackdown, and he defended what he had done.
   ``I've tried to protect and preserve a long term relationship
that is very important for the United States. No, it is not time for
normalcy ... but I don't want to hurt the (Chinese) people by
cutting off commerce,'' he said.
   On another foreign policy issue, Bush said it's up to the two
Germanys to decide whether to move toward reunification. ``I don't
accept'' that such a move is a threat to peace or to Western
interests, he said.
   Bush also stuck to his opposition to a ban on all assault rifles,
touching on a gun control issue that is politically potent in rural
Montana.
   Bush struck a combative tone when it came to his plan for a
capital gains tax cut _ a plan that was approved in the House Ways
and Means Committee last week with the help of six Democratic votes.
   Senate Democratic Leader George Mitchell said after the vote that
Democrats would not be willing to enter into comprehensive budget
negotiations with the administration if the capital gains tax cut
were approved.
   Said Bush: ``This idea that we won't talk - I don't think that's
right and I don't think the American people would support that. I
don't think it's right for people who get whipped in committee to
then start a lot of threats on the other side.''
   Bush, in a speech just prior to his news conference, urged a
``new greening of America'' and proposed a national tree-planting
campaign as a low-cost part of his national clean-air strategy.
   He also said he would order special environmental training for
Peace Corps representatives abroad, ``to stop pollution before it
starts, and ensure that economic development and environmental
stewardship go hand-in-hand.''

<HEAD>Agreement Reached Over Rocky Flats Waste</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal energy and environmental officials
announced an agreement Monday for handling wastes from the federal
Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant, an issue that had threatened to
close the plant.
   Energy Secretary James Watkins said the agreement, also involving
officials from Colorado, shows the Department of Energy's commitment
to follow the nation's environmental laws.
   ``This agreement is a first in what will be a series of steps to
refocus our priorities on environmental compliance,'' he said in a
statement issued in Denver. ``I believe today's action also further
demonstrates DOE's willingness to work toward resolution of
compliance issues with both the (Environmental Protection Agency)
and the states.''
   The problem arose because of concern by officials for DOE and
Rockwell International Corp., which runs the plant for DOE, about
their personal liability for the plant's failure to follow
environmental laws by storing the mixed wastes at the plant.
   Officials said the concern was real, because earlier this year
several civilian employees at the Army's Aberdeen Proving Grounds in
Maryland were convicted of illegal storage, treatment and disposal
of hazardous wastes there.
   Long-term storage of such wastes at a production site isn't
allowed, yet there is no federally approved disposal site or
treatment process for wastes including both hazardous materials and
radioactive elements.
   DOE officials noted the problem earlier this summer, and
threatened to close the plant until some solution was reached. Then
last week Rockwell officials indicated the same concern, and said
shutting the plant was an option.
   The plant 16 miles northwest of Denver employs about 6,000 people
and is the only one in the nation that makes plutonium triggers for
nuclear weapons.
   Federal officials worried the nation's defense could be
compromised with such a shutdown.
   Under the agreement, which first came to light last week, DOE
will handle the wastes in compliance with hazardous waste storage
requirements, and will minimize the generation of such wastes.
   In addition, DOE is committing in the agreement to develop a
national report that will include the information necessary to
assess the situation at other DOE facilities nationwise.

<TEXT>
   Five South Americans charged
with trying to break two Colombians accused of cocaine smuggling out
of prison appeared in court Monday amid tight security.
   A charge read in court by provincial court judge James Harper
said the conspiracy was hatched in Medellin, Colombia's drug
capital, between July 2 and Sept. 14. All five were also charged
with weapons offenses and carrying forged passports.
   The courthouse had the look of a building under siege, complete
with riot police and sharpshooters on roofs. People entering the
building had their bags searched.
   The five suspects entered the courtroom under heavy guard and
chained at the wrists and legs.
   The two Colombians were arrested in April after a small airplane
loaded with fuel and 1,100 pounds of cocaine worth $250 million
landed at a remote airstrip near Fredericton. Police said they
believed the plane flew directly to eastern Canada from Colombia.
   Several other people were arrested in Toronto and Montreal in
connection with the cocaine haul, police said.
   Fredericton police issued a warrant for the arrest of Diego
Caycedo, who they allege is the Medellin cartel's chief organizer of
cocaine exports to Canada. They asked Colombia to extradite him.
   The nationalities of the five South Americans were not
immediately clear; they originally were reported to be carrying
Venezuelan passports but there was doubt about the authenticity of
the documents. U.S. authorities said two of the five were believed
to be Colombians.
   Four were taken into custody in Edmundston on Wednesday when,
after a tip, police seized an array of rifles, machine guns,
ammunition and tear gas. The fifth man was arrested on Thursday in
Saint John.
   None of the men entered pleas. They were ordered held in a
federal penitentiary until a bail hearing on Thursday.
   The five were identified as Wilmer Ramon Zanabria, Tito
Sanchez-Ruiz, Eulojio Manzano-Bustamante, Juan Carlos Hernandez and
William Jose Rodriguez.

<HEAD>Secret Service Agent Draws Six Months in Halfway House</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Secret Service agent convicted of using
excessive force to arrest a man near a presidential candidate's New
York motorcade last year was sentenced Monday to six months in a
halfway house.
   U.S. District Judge Pierre Leval imposed the sentence on Kevin
Schatzle after viewing a videotape of the April 10, 1988 incident.
At the time, Schatzle was in the security detail for Sen. Albert
Gore, then campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination.
   A jury convicted Schatzle, 28, in June of using excessive force
when he kicked and punched attorney Christopher Gorayeb, 32. He had
faced up to one year in prison.
   During the trial, Schatzle testified that the lawyer spat at him.
But Gorayeb said he was attacked when he yelled an obsenity at the
passing motorcade because one of its cars almost hit him as he
legally crossed the street. Gorayeb testified that he suffered a
broken nose and deep bruises.
   Schatzle had been acquitted of a second charge of making a false
arrest.
   ``I think that what happened is that when Gorayeb spat, the agent
simply blew his stack,'' Leval said. He also imposed three years
probation and a $2,000.
   While noting Schatzle's previous good record as a law enforcement
officer, the judge said the agent had engaged in ``serious
misconduct'' during the incident.
   His attorney, Maurice Nadjari, had urged the judge not to impose
any prison time. He said Schatzle had earned the respect of his
colleagues and superiors during five years in the New York Police
Department and four years with the Secret Service.
   Leval allowed Nadjari time to submit a written motion to postpone
the sentence pending appeal. Schatzle remains free until the judge
rules.

<DATELINE>ERIE, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former television anchorman has sued his
station in federal court, charging he was demoted because of his age.
   Hyle Richmond, 62, filed suit in U.S. District Court against
WICU-TV and its parent company, Great Lakes Communications Inc.,
seeking reinstatement to his job as an on-air newscaster and
anchorman. He is still employed by the station.
   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission found in May that the
station violated age discrimination laws in actions against Richmond
and other older employees of the station, according to Richmond's
lawsuit.
   The lawsuit, which was filed in early September, claims that
Richmond, who had more than 30 years on the air, was demoted to a
reporter's job on Sept. 28, 1987, and was replaced by Lisa Adams,
who is in her early 30s.
   It further says the station also fired or demoted three other
on-air newscasters or anchor people who were more than 40 years old
and replaced them with younger employees. The three others did not
join in the suit.
   Clarence Paolella, the station's general manager, could not be
reached for comment. A station telephone operator said no other
executives could comment.
   Richmond is seeking reinstatement to his former on-air job,
damages for loss of earnings, benefits because of his demotion, and
other damages.

<HEAD>FCC Chief Suggests Voluntary Code Against `Shock Radio'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the Federal Communications
Commission suggests broadcasters adopt a voluntary code to control
``shock radio'' _ the use of sexually and racially oriented humor to
attract audiences.
   ``We are not simply recorders, transmitters and antennas,'' FCC
Chairman Alfred Sikes told a group of broadcasters attending the
National Association of Broadcasters radio convention Sept. 15. ``We
are what we broadcast.''
   Sikes, a former owner of several radio stations, suggested
reviving the NAB's programming code, which was dropped in the early
1980s as the result of a federal antitrust suit against provisions
regarding commercials.
   Standards should be drawn up by the industry, without government
pressure, said Sikes, who took over the FCC chairmanship in August.
   ``The government rightly leaves all programming decisions to
broadcasters today,'' he said. ``Not only is that as it should be,
but it should also be seen as an invitation to work among
yourselves.''
   Sikes said he was prepared to work with the industry and the U.S.
Justice Department, which filed the antitrust suit, ``to ensure that
broadcasters have the freedom to develop sound, voluntary,
programming standards.''
   The FCC announced on Aug. 24 that it was beginning enforcement
action against three stations _ WLUP-AM in Chicago, KSJO-FM in San
Jose, Calif., and WFBQ-FM in Indianapolis _ ``which may have
broadcast indecent programs in violation of the law.''
   NAB President Edward Fritts said the organization could not
consider a code unless pending legislation granting the broadcast
industry an antitrust exemption for programming content codes passes
Congress.
   Even if an antitrust exemption is granted, a code could still
lead to legal problems, Fritts said.
   ``It doesn't preclude the NAB from being sued on civil grounds,
on First Amendment rights,'' he said.

<HEAD>White House Reprimands Mosbacher on HDTV, Source Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher won't
concentrate on promoting a high-definition television industry in
the United States after being reprimanded by the White House, a
congressional source said.
   ``Mosbacher in their eyes is a renegade promoting industial
policy and they thought it was absolutely necessary to reprimand
him,'' said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Mosbacher ``was made to stand in front of the class and made to
say `I believe in the free market 500 times,''' the source said.
   As a result, the Commerce Department will consider HDTV, the next
generation of television, only as part of a broad-based effort to
boost U.S. technological competitiveness, an administration source
said Sept. 11.
   Mosbacher said that for months he was prepared to recommend that
the Bush administration loosen tax and antitrust laws to jump-start
private American industry efforts to compete with Europe and Japan
to build HDTV, which promises motion-picture clarity and compact
disc-quality sound.
   Commerce Department officials first promised Congress they would
unveil the government plans for HDTV by midsummer and, later, by the
end of the year.
   Now, the administration official said, the HDTV initiative is on
hold.
   Advocates of HDTV say it could revitalize a moribund U.S.
electronics industry and have important applications in medicine,
defense and other industries.
   It is envisioned as a $20 billion industry by 2000 and would be a
``technology driver'' for industries such as computer chips.
   The American Electronics Association has asked Congress for more
than a billion dollars in development money for HDTV, and several
bills are pending in Congress that would provide taxpayer money to
spur the industry.
   But a Congressional Budget Office report last month said HDTV
claims were ``very optimistic'' and that even under the rosiest of
scenarios, HDTV sales would be small relative to other electronic
equipment markets.

   By the thousands, people have fled Beirut,

the countryside, many still face other kinds of hardship. This is
one of a series of periodic reports by Associated Press
correspondents on life in Beirut, an emptying city.

<TEXT>
   Iman Batal, now a refugee 25 miles
from her home in beleaguered Beirut, clustered her whimpering,
hungry children around her beside their makeshift tent.
   ``We only eat meat in our dreams,'' she said.
   A pot of potatoes boiled on an open fire, their only food this
day in their new life on a bank of the Awali River in southern
Lebanon.
   Like tens of thousands of other Beirutis who have fled their
homes in six months of fierce shelling between Christian and Syrian
forces, Mrs. Batal, her husband Ahmed and their nine children, aged
1 to 10, live hand-to-mouth in squalid camps of ragged tents
fashioned from blankets and plastic sheets in southern Lebanon and
the mountains northeast of the city.
   The Batals are Sunni Moslems from one side of the Green Line that
divides Beirut into Moslem and Christian sectors.
   Elie Haddad and his family are Christians from the other side of
the line.
   The Haddads have been living for four months in a shelter made of
nylon sheets, cardboard and tree branches at a camp near the St.
Sharbel Maronite Catholic Church in the mountains.
   Haddad, his wife Ilham and their five children, aged 4 to 11,
watched helplessly as their shelter on a rock-studded hillside
overlooking vineyards was battered by unseasonal torrential rains.
   ``What are we going to do when the rainy season starts?'' Mrs.
Haddad lamented.
   Police estimate that around 1.35 million of Beirut's 1.50 million
people have abandoned their homes in the shell-battered city over
the last few months, fleeing the battles in which more than 900
people have been killed and 2,680 wounded.
   Many refugees have moved in with relatives and friends, or rented
apartments, or anything they can find, in southern, northern or
eastern Lebanon. Rents have soared.
   But an estimated 35,000 people, like the Batals and the Haddads,
are living as squatters in mosques, churches, schools, empty
buildings and in the fields.
   The Haddads fled from their home in the Ashrafiyeh neighborhood
near the Green Line because their apartment block had no bomb
shelter.
   ``Now we're refugees in our own country,'' said Haddad.
   Despite their parlous situation, the Haddads and other Christian
families around the church at Innaya are better off than many other
refugees. The church has provided fresh water, some food and outdoor
sanitary facilities.
   Haddad is a police officer who works every couple of days, which
means he is paid regularly and can buy food and other essentials.
   Ahmed Batal, on the other hand, is penniless. He lost his job at
a tile factory four months ago when it closed because it had lost
electric power and so few employees were showing up anyway due to
the shelling.
   ``We've sold our washing machine, the television set and the
refrigerator to buy food,'' Mrs. Batal said. ``We've nothing else to
sell. Most of our belongings were smashed in the bombardment. Now
the money's run out.''
   The Batals live with 1,500 other Beirutis on the banks of the
Awali River. They fled the capital two months ago after their
apartment in the Ein Mreisseh district of west Beirut was hit by a
155mm-shell.
   Batal watches in despair as his children, barefoot and wearing
soiled, tattered clothes, go hungry in the miserable camp just north
of the coastal city of Sidon.
   Their most acute problem is the lack of potable water: only one
faucet is available for about 300 families.
   There are no latrines. Some of the refugees use a rest room in a
nearby gas station, when the owners allow them.
   The stench of garbage and other waste pervades the camp.
   Mrs. Batal said she has worn the same clothes she had on when she
fled Beirut.
   ``I take a bath, fully clothed, in the river,'' she said.
   Health is a problem.
   ``The conditions in camps likes these have caused skin
diseases,'' said Michel Dufour, chief of the International Committee
of the Red Cross team in Lebanon.
   He said the Red Cross has supplied medicines to clinics in
southern Lebanon to treat skin problems among refugees.
   The Red Cross also has handed out food parcels, blankets, kitchen
supplies and cleaning materials to supplement aid from Moslem and
Christian militias. The exodus from Beirut has sent prices in
regions like southern Lebanon soaring. A two-room unfurnished
apartment in Sidon, south of the Awali, which rented for the
equivalent of $50 a month before March, now costs $400.
   A bundle of 12 Arabic bread loaves costs $2, double what it was a
few months ago. Meat and vegetable prices have also doubled.
   The influx of refugees has antagonized the people of the south,
mostly Shiite Moslems, who have to pay the same inflated prices.
   The conservative southerners are also offended by the miniskirted
Beirut women on the streets of Sidon and Tyre.
   Said Abdullah, a Sunni clergyman in the village of Mazboud
declared: ``These visitors must respect the social traditions of
this region. Women must be decently dressed in line with Moslem
custom. Our young men are not accustomed to the way of life in the
big city.''

<TEXT>
   Gen. Michel Aoun, who serves as Lebanon's
president and calls himself its savior, works, eats and sleeps in a
command bunker two floors under a presidential palace crumpled by
Syrian artillery fire.
   From there, he holds out in the war of his Christian forces
against the powerful Syrians and their allies, pledging to save
Lebanon, or what's left of it, even if it means the destruction of
Beirut.
   ``The Syrians have made life unbearable for my people and I'm
going to make life equally unbearable for them in Lebanon,'' he said
in a recent interview in the bunker.
   Syrian artillery has systematically reduced the two-story hilltop
palace in the Christian suburb of Baabda to wreckage since fighting
erupted March 8 into another fierce round of Lebanon's 14-year-old
civil war.
   The 54-year-old general has rarely ventured out of the spartan
bunker since he launched his ``war of liberation'' against the
Syrians.
   Aides say Aoun, a small pudgy man always clad in fatigues, lives
on a daily diet of beans, rice and potatoes, occasionally a steak.
   He works an 18-hour day, rising every morning at 6.a.m. for a
brief period of exercises.
   His wife, Nadia, and three daughters, Mireille, Claudine and
Chantal, stayed with him in the bunker in the initial weeks of the
fighting. But he has sent them to the family home in the mountains
for safety.
   The general's critics call him ``Napol-Aoun,'' hinting that his
lopsided war against the Syrians, who with their allies outnumber
his forces by at least 3 to 1, stem from delusions of grandeur.
   President Hafez Assad of Syria, his plan to pacify Lebanon
thwarted by Aoun's campaign, angrily calls the Christian leader that
``mad little general.''
   But to most of the 1 million Christians trapped for the last six
months in their enclave north of Beirut by the Syrians, Aoun is a
hero.
   They consider him the first Lebanese leader to stand up to the
Syrians.
   Despite savage artillery battles in which more than 900 people
have been killed and nearly 2,700 wounded, many of them Christian
civilians, Aoun is unbending in the belief that his crusade is right.
   ``This war needs sacrifice and patience,'' he said. ``No one
wages a war and promises paradise. But I believe I have the support
of the people.''
   A Maronite Catholic, Aoun is the Lebanese army commander,
although fewer than half the army's 42,000 soldiers support him.
Most of the army's Moslem units have defected and set up their own
command but stayed out of the fighting.
   About 10,000 soldiers have remained loyal to Aoun and he is
highly popular with them.
   He bridles at being called the Christians' leader, insisting he
is a national Lebanese leader, a patriot fighting for Christians and
Moslems alike.
   He notes with pride that his men include some 3,000 Sunni Moslems.
   Aoun's campaign has made him a prime target for assassination.
   Six Lebanese were arrested in Cyprus in May on a mission to shoot
down his helicopter with missiles when he flew to the Mediterranean
island en route to an Arab summit in Morocco. As it turned out he
never left Beirut.
   Aides say that Aoun sleeps with a pistol under his pillow in his
bunker and has a deep fear of car bombs, a favored method of
assassination in Lebanon.
   In 1983, unidentified gunmen shot up his motorcade, wounding him
in the head and arm. The following year, his men discovered a car
bomb in Beirut only minutes before his motorcade was due to pass.
   One Western military attache called him ``the best officer the
Lebanese Army has ever produced.''
   While few question his courage in Lebanon's long civil war, they
say he's out of his depth in the world of politics. But even Moslem
officers say Aoun's personal integrity is beyond reproach.
   They noted that when the Israelis moved into west Beirut in 1982,
they asked him to send troops into the Palestinian refugee camps of
Sabra and Chatilla.
   He refused. The right-wing Lebanese Forces, the Christians' main
militia, went in instead and killed hundreds of Palestinians.
   Aoun always wanted to be a soldier. He entered Lebanon's military
academy when he was 20 and graduated three years later as an
artillery lieutenant.
   He was named army commander in June, 1984, at the age of 49, the
youngest since Lebanon gained independence from France in 1943.
   Aoun was wounded three times in 1983-84, when as a colonel he
commanded the strategic mountaintop town of Souk el-Gharb southeast
of Beirut against Syrian-backed militia forces who had driven the
Christians out of the mountains.
   His men repulsed six major assaults, losing 400 dead.
   Aoun had hoped that when he took on the Syrians this time, the
United States would support him. But Washington has stayed on the
sidelines.
   The United States withdrew the last of its diplomats from Beirut
on Sept. 6 after Aoun accused the Americans of betraying him.

   Just in time to serve as an antidote to the
wave of sentimental reminiscence arising from the 50th anniversary
of World War II, scholar Paul Fussell has written an angry book with
this startling proposition:
   The whole truth about the war is still not known and never fully
will be known because it is too horrible to tell.
   ``For the past 50 years the Allied war has been sanitized and
romanticized almost beyond recognition by the sentimental, the loony
patriotic, the ignorant and the bloodthirsty,'' writes Fussell. ``I
have tried to balance the scales.''
   The result is ``Wartime: Understanding and Behavior in the Second
World War,'' an iconoclastic, opinionated and bitter rebuttal of the
heroic version that's making the newspapers these days.
   His book does not address the war's morality, necessity or
inevitability.
   Instead, his purpose is to dig out the untold fragments _ untold
because they were suppressed by propagandists and censors at the
time, romanticized by the survivors or still too discomforting to
tell _ that make his point.
   Some of Fussell's truths:
   _Wars are fought by boys, innocent of life's experiences.
   ``Boys who had never shaved machine-gunned other boys creeping up
with Panzerfausts in their adolescent hands,'' is Fussell's
description of what World War II combat sometimes came down to.
``Among the horribly wounded the most common cry was `Mother!'''
   At the start, men had to be 21 to be drafted but that soon
dropped to 18. By late 1944, these boys were facing, across the
front, the Hitler Jugend, consisted of boys age 16 or 17, sometimes
as young as 12.
   _Death comes not as cleanly as the mind imagines. Soldiers are
just as likely to have their belly blown open as to be shot neat,
clean and noble, where the movies always have soldiers shot, in the
shoulder or the chest.
   ``You would expect front-line soldiers to be struck and hurt by
bullets and shell fragments, but such is the popular insulation from
the facts that you would not expect them to be hurt, sometimes
killed, by being struck by parts of their friends' bodies violently
detached,'' writes Fussell.
   ``In the face of such horror, the distinction between friend and
enemy vanishes, and the violent dismemberment of any human being
becomes equally traumatic.''
   _Home-front propaganda to the contrary, allied troops were not
the best armed in the history of warfare.
   ``They knew that their automatic rifles (World War I vintage)
were slower and clumsier, and they knew that the Germans had a much
better light machine gun. ... They knew that their own tanks, both
American and British, were ridiculously under-armed and
under-armored, so that they were inevitably destroyed in an open
encounter with an equal number of German Panzers. ... And they knew
that the greatest single weapon of the war, the atomic bomb
excluded, was the German 88-mm flat-trajectory gun, which brought
down thousands of bombers and tens of thousands of soldiers.''
   _Far more often than is known, soldiers are killed by blunders on
their own side, hushed up to preserve homefront morale.
   Fussell devotes a chapter to such disasters, telling, for
example, how nervous Navy gunners shot down 23 planes carrying
paratroopers of the 82nd Airborne Division during the invasion of
Sicily.
   A Canadian soldier tells of an American who confused him for the
enemy at Normandy and wouldn't stop firing. ``It's him or me. So I
shoot that boy even though I know he's a Yank. ... Poor bugger. A
corporal from some Texas outfit.''
   After the Normandy landing, the Americans ordered up a round of
bombing to soften Nazi fortifications inland. Accidentally, American
planes dropped their bombs on American lines, killing 25. The next
day the American line was secretly pulled back to avoid a disastrous
repeat. This time the planes killed 110 GIs and a general.
   Fussell quotes an eyewitness:
   ``Some enraged American units opened fire on their own aircraft,
a not-uncommon practice among all the armies in Normandy when
suffering at the hands of their own pilots.''
   So much for ``precision bombing'' or its latter-day equivalent in
Vietnam or Libya, the ``surgical air strike.''
   Fussell's book is going to displease some who would prefer to
remember the courage and forget the carnage.
   His own biography denies such critics ammunition. The author is
professor of English literature at the University of Pennsylvania
but, more pertinently, was a young army lieutenant in the 103rd
Infantry Division in France in World War II. He was severely wounded
in combat.
   The war that author Studs Terkel calls ``The Good War'' is his
war, too. But his word for it is ``stupid.''
   The ``terrible fact,'' he says, is that ``military successes are
achieved only at the cost of insensate violence and fear and agony,
with no bargains allowed.''

   When Ricki Lake smiles, which is most of the
time on screen and off, it's not part of the act.
   The 21-year-old actress has plenty to smile about. She joins the
cast for the third season of ABC's ``China Beach'' as Holly
Pelligrino, the donut dolly. She will work often with Dana Delany,
who just won an Emmy for her portrayal of nurse Colleen McMurphy.
   She's in the current movie release ``Cookie,'' and ``Cry Baby''
is coming out soon. Her happy face and zaftig figure have brightened
such movies as ``Hairspray,'' ``Working Girl,'' ``Last Exit to
Brooklyn'' and TV's ``Baby Cakes'' in recent years.
   ``Holly's well aware of why she's in Vietnam,'' said Lake.
``She's a smart girl but she's the baby of all those there. Her
perky energy makes the guys happy. She reminds them of home. But she
also grates on McMurphy's nerves, which is great because we have a
little conflict.
   ``McMurphy is moody and depressed. It's great to play opposite
Dana. She has that edge that makes her endearing. Holly's happiness
should make her endearing, too. Her happiness is just the way she
is. I'm pretty happy, too. I think we're pretty similar. She knows
more about Vietnam than I do, since I was born in 1968.''
   When Lake was offered the role she'd never seen ``China Beach,''
which focuses on the women in Vietnam at an evacuation hospital and
recreation center.
   She was hesitant about taking on the role. She'd been doing
mostly features, but had devoted six months to a comedy pilot for
CBS called ``Starting Now.'' She played a ``gofer'' on a children's
program who was trying to make it as an actress.
   ``It's too bad it turned out a bummer,'' she said. ``I did my
best. I had a great time. But things happen for a reason. Had it
worked out I wouldn't be in `China Beach.' I'm happy now that I took
the role.''
   She will be a recurring character in ``China Beach,'' which has
its season premiere Wednesday.
   Lake calls herself a ``Sesame Street'' baby who grew up in New
York's Westchester County. At one point she wanted to be change her
name to Laura Ingalls, after the heroine on ``Little House on the
Prairie.'' When she watched ``The Brady Bunch'' she wanted to be
Cindy because she related to the youngest child on a show.
   ``I never saw movies when I was young,'' she said. ``I always
wanted to be on television. I was the older sister in my family, but
I wanted to be the youngest child on television. I never thought
about feature films until `Hairspray.'''
   Lake calls John Waters' ``Cry Baby'' a musical comedy about
juvenile delinquents in Baltimore in 1954.
   ``It's a kind of warped `West Side Story,''' she said. ``I play
Pepper, who's pregnant for the third time. She just loves being
pregnant. I don't get to sing it it. In fact, I don't sing in any of
my films. But it's the first project I've ever been on that I felt
was going to be really, really good.''
   She was also pregnant in ``Last Exit to Brooklyn,'' one of her
few non-cheery roles.
   Lake lives in Los Angeles with her two Blue Russian cats, Annie
and Molly.
   Ricki Lake is her real name and she said for years she hated
having a boy's first name.
   She studied voice for nine years and began playing the piano when
she was 5. ``I just started playing from a piece of sheet music,''
she said. ``My mom was shocked. Then I started studying ballet. I
loved it. I was the center of attention.
   ``My mother kind of held me back. She was afraid I couldn't take
the rejection. You still face rejection. It's part of the business.
You feel terrible when you're shot down when you want a job that
means so much to you.''

<TEXT>
   At 6 a.m. one recent Thursday, Soun
Sundary, gentle and serene at 21, gave birth to her first child and
held her up to a Cambodia that has known only war for two decades.
   ``I don't know about the future, whether there will be peace or
not,'' she said as the sun shone into her hospital room after days
of monsoon rains.
   She and her husband, Soun Rithy, 25, have spent most of their
lives with their tragic nation in turmoil and mass deaths _ the
civil war of 1970-75, the fanatical communist Khmer Rouge rule of
1975-78 and the fighting since Vietnam invaded in late 1978.
   Seven members of their two families died in the murderous scourge
of the Khmer Rouge who defeated a pro-West government in 1975.
   The couple and their daughter are likely to see more killing in
the years ahead, even though the Vietnamese are pulling out.
   Rithy had come to Phnom Penh for the birth of his child but is
returning to southern Koh Kong province, where he has fought as a
government soldier for seven years against the Khmer Rouge and other
guerrillas.
   Peace talks in Paris have collapsed. Vietnam's pullout, due to be
completed Sept. 26, will leave the Vietnamese-installed Communist
government in Phnom Penh facing the guerrillas alone in what could
be the war's most chaotic and violent phase.
   ``We would like to have peace, really,'' Vice Premier Kong Sam-Ol
said in an interview. ``For almost 20 years, our people have known
more about killing and war than peace.''
   Most feared is the possibility that Vietnam's pullout will allow
the return of the Khmer Rouge, the black pajama-clad fighters who
killed hundreds of thousands of people in torture chambers and slave
labor camps after they took over in 1975.
   The government claims the army will have no problems handling the
guerrillas.
   Many others do not feel as confident.
   Some Phnom Penh residents have been stocking rice in case
supplies are cut off by escalating fighting, said Khieu Kanharith,
editor of the government-sponsored weekly Kampuchea.
   Some senior government officials have told Western aid workers
they are saving money in case they have to flee.
   ``They don't know what is going to happen after September if
there are problems with the Khmer Rouge,'' one aid worker said.
``They believe if there are problems, the first problems would be
for them.''
   At Kompong Chhnang, just north of Phnom Penh, Maj. Chhour
Chandoeun, the provincial military commander, said his nine
battalions are hard pressed in their fight against the 300 Khmer
Rouge guerrillas in the area.
   ``They don't stay in one place and we don't know all their hiding
places,'' he said.
   An aid official said the government's military draft appears to
be widening. A few months ago, some parents forbade their sons to
leave the house as overzealous recruiters yanked men off the
streets. Some youths flee to the border with Thailand, only to be
rounded up by the guerrillas for service.
   A 10 p.m.-5 a.m. curfew was lifted in April, but the climate of
war still pervades this riverside capital.
   In July, authorities closed dance halls that had been packed
nightly since they were permitted to open last year. Mayor Thong
Khong blamed drunken quarrels and said only the rich could visit
them anyway.
   ``At that time, there was increased fighting at the border and it
was difficult to justify the sacrifice at the border and the good
life in Phnom Penh,'' one foreign-aid official said.
   For many years, popular support for the Vietnamese-backed
government had stemmed mostly from its being the only alternative to
the Khmer Rouge. With Vietnam's pullout, Phnom Penh extended
economic reforms to include a freeing up of private trade in an
effort to raise primitive living conditions.
   Ironically, it created a new security problem by worsening
corruption among officials, and corruption was a factor that helped
the Khmer Rouge topple Lon Nol's pro-West government in 1975.
   The reforms reduced somewhat the gulf between the people and
their leaders. But in addition to the fear of more war remains the
widespread fear of the authorities and ``the police,'' who are
thought to be everywhere.

   ``Help Wanted.''
   For the first time since Mexico plunged into an economic crisis
in 1982 and a little more than nine months into President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari's term, the signs are going up outside plants and
factories scrambling for workers.
   ``Two years ago it was hard for someone over 35 to find a job.
Now we're placing people as old as 50,'' said Tomas Acosta, head of
the placement service for Monterrey's National Federation of
Independent Unions.
   Bacilio Ortiz, personnel manager for a contractor building
Monterrey's first subway, said he had to go into the countryside to
find workers.
   ``We're looking for people that will do hard work,'' he said.
``There are people here but they prefer to work inside where it's
air conditioned.''
   ``Oh, there's work,'' said Rosa Maria Garcia, who runs a small
meat market in a working class neighborhood. ``But many people still
can't make it.''
   She said the average consumer is still living with the economic
crisis, still buying less meat, cheaper cuts or stretching it in
stews.
   The average worker's buying power is still 50 percent below what
it was in 1981, the year before the collapse, and prices are going
up despite a wage and price freeze.
   Nevertheless, positive signs have come with figures that
indicated Mexico's gross domestic product, the value of its goods
and services, was up 2.4 percent in the first part of 1989 over the
same period last year and that industrial production grew 4.7
percent through May.
   Salinas' administration had cautiously predicted annual growth
would reach about 1.5 percent while some independent analysts
predicted 1 percent growth at best. But now analysts are projecting
1989 annual growth in the same range _ 2.2 percent to 2.4 percent.
   ``It's begun to neutralize the crisis,'' said Jorge Mancilla,
director of economic studies for the Nuevo Leon state Chamber of
Industries in Monterrey, which is 100 miles south of the Texas
border.
   What some analysts are calling the ``mini-boom of 1989'' would
have been viewed as sluggish by the standards of 1981, the last year
of a boom that saw 8 percent annual growth rates fed by skyrocketing
oil revenues.
   ``The principal motor back then was the excess demand of the
public sector. There isn't that right now,'' said Everardo Elizondo,
general director of the economic forecasting firm Index.
   But in a country that has lived through eight years of hardship _
a foreign debt that topped $107 billion, triple-digit inflation,
shrinking economic output, plummeting oil prices, plummeting
salaries, plummeting consumer buying power _ even minimal growth is
raising eyebrows.
   ``Nobody knows for certain why the economy grew so fast at the
beginning of 1989. It wasn't forecast,'' said Elizondo.
   Acosta said he has the answer. ``There's a feeling of confidence
again,'' he said. ``It has to do with the attitude of the
government.''
   Salinas has stepped up economic measures initiated by his
predecessor, Miguel de la Madrid, most notably the opening of the
economy to imports. Salinas has said his greatest achievement so far
is a renewed spirit of confidence.
   Driving to reach a 6 percent annual growth rate by the end of his
term and create an economy that can provide jobs for 1 million new
workers a year, Salinas has sold off inefficient state-owned
companies, taken decisive action to fight corruption and union
featherbedding and pushed to encourage new investment by both
Mexicans and foreigners.
   ``In nine months we have a new foreign investment law,
transporation has been deregulated, the financial system has been
deregulated, the economy is being reprivatized,'' said Mancilla.
``These are giant steps toward modernization.''
   Economic indicators from the first half of 1989 ``demonstrate a
tendency for sustained moderate growth,'' he said.
   Exports of manufactured goods hit a record $5 billion through May
_ 4{ times higher than in 1981.
   The private sector has responded by increasing investments,
especially in machinery, in order to compete with foreign imports
and, for many, to enter the lucrative export market.
   Private investment was up 3.6 percent through May compared with
the same period last year.
   Last year Acosta received about 30 calls a month from companies
needing workers and now he gets as many as 1,500.
   Job applications have dropped by half, he said.
   ``It hasn't gotten to the point of 1981, but it's going in that
direction,'' Acosta said.
   The demand for labor is beginning to drive the base salary up in
many companies. Ortiz, for example, pays 10 percent above minimum
for starting workers.
   Shelby Theriot, manager of a pipe-contracting company, said he
had to offer 50 percent above the minimum to lure a primary school
dropout from the underground economy to work as a messenger.
   The underground economy now accounts for about 25 percent of
gross domestic product, up from 10 percent to 15 percent before 1982.
   ``In many ways it's more lucrative to have a stand at a flea
market than being on salary,'' said Mancilla.
   But the ``mini boom'' has not trickled down to people like
44-year-old Mario Figueroa, who dropped out of school after the
fourth grade.
   He earns 30 percent above the minimum wage, the equivalent of
about $30 a week. But with three school-age children at home, he
said, ``It's very difficult to live.''
   Still, Figueroa added that he was lucky to find a job working at
a furniture manufacturer. He had lost his old job at an
air-conditioning company when it was bought out.
   In dollar terms, due to the plunge in the peso's value, the
current minimum wage is less than half the 1981 wage _ $3.25 a day
today compared to $7.50 at the height of the boom.
   Mancilla said there's no signs of a quick fix in consumer buying
power.
   ``The recovery in salaries could take until the next century,''
he said.

   Many hospitals are looking at new ways to care
for acutely ill, but ambulatory patients.
   ``Some have made arrangements with adjacent hotels, and there is
one out West that is considering revamping its parking lot to
accommodate recreational vehicles, where patients could live during
their stays,'' says Barbara Giloth of the American Hospital
Association.
   Dr. Anthony J. Grieco, medical director for the Cooperative Care
Unit at the New York University Medical Center says there are about

   The question before the court remains:
What is entertainment?
   It is a subject discussed the livelong day in this gritty little
town of 6,700 in the Pennsylvania hills, especially over the plywood
counter of Dad's Coffee Shop, an unremarkable establishment in every
respect save one. At Dad's, the waitresses, who serve the coffee in
Styrofoam cups, are naked from the waist up.
   Well, not quite. The law says they must wear what are called
pasties, tiny stick-on things that glitter and seem to serve only to
accentuate the obvious, and Dad says he insists on operating
strictly within the law.
   Dad is Thomas Wasley Jr., a stout man of 46 with wire-rimmed
glasses, thick black hair just going to gray, and brown eyes that
plead astonishment over the trouble that has befallen him.
   Wasley and his coffee shop came into prominence last May, during
a local election campaign as it happened, which brought him more
attention, and customers, than his small ads in the sports section
of the Scrantonian Tribune ever produced.
   ``I even got a call from a radio station in Australia,'' he was
saying the other day, over coffee. ``I thought it was phony at
first, but it wasn't. That's when I put up that map.''
   The map of the United States is about the only thing that
decorates the pale walls of the coffee shop. That and a bulletin
board covered with newspaper clippings about the dispute over the
meaning of entertainment. A legend above the map asks, ``How far did
you come to Dad's?'' Pins are stuck in about a dozen states.
   Now business has fallen off from 500 or so customers a day to
about 75, and the paper will no longer run Dad's ads.
   ``People think I'm closed,'' Wasley said. ``I'm struggling, but
I'm not closed.''
   Not closed, but subject to a fine of $500 a day since the city
magistrate determined, in a 13-page decision rendered June 26, that
Dad's Coffee Shop was providing ``live entertainment'' for which he
needed a special permit under the zoning law.
   Wasley has appealed to a county court and says he will continue
if necessary to appeal to higher courts on up the line.
   The magistrate, John E.V. Pieski, ruled that since the zoning
statute did not define ``live entertainment'' he would use the
dictionary definition: ``The act of diverting, amusing or causing
someone's time to pass agreeably.''
   ``That would apply to cheerful waitresses at Dunkin' Donuts,''
says Wasley.
   But, argued the magistrate, Wasley advertised his waitresses, not
his coffee.
   ``So do the places that advertise their waitress-of-the-month
instead of their food,'' says Wasley.
   But when Wasley's waitresses went from wearing swimsuits to
baring their breasts, ruled the magistrate, the price of his coffee
doubled to $2 a cup, no refills. A clear indication, he ruled, that
Wasley considered them live entertainment and waitresses only
incidentally.
   ``All price reflects is overhead. You have to hire topless girls
from out of town, pay agency fees, motel room costs. That still
doesn't mean they constitute live entertainment,'' says Wasley.
``They don't sing or dance. All they do is serve coffee.''
   The debate lingers on.
   According to John Maholic, the borough president, the dispute was
more political than semantic. ``If it were not an election year it
would never have come up,'' he argues.
   The pot boiled over a few weeks before the May 16 Democratic
primary when a group of residents presented to the council a
petition with 1,100 signatures opposing Dad's ``or any other
enterprise of obscene nature.''
   ``In a town of 6,700,'' said Maholic, ``1,000 names is a lot of
voters.''
   The resident who headed the petition drive, Frank Siderowicz,
says there is nothing to the idea politics is involved.
   ``It was a moral issue from the beginning,'' he insists. ``We
collected those signatures outside our churches after services.
Politics was never mentioned. It was a coincidence that an election
campaign was going on.
   ``This is small-town America. A topless coffee shop doesn't fit.''
   Dickson City is a small town all right, but hardly typical of
what the phrase usually conveys. It abuts a string of similar
communities just north of Scranton, suburbs really, whose varying
ethnic makeups reflect the immigrant groups who arrived here years
ago to dig coal.
   It is a town of seven churches and 15 taverns. It also features a
topless go-go joint, The Rose, which is across the street from the
borough hall, and a porno shop on a major highway that cuts through
town.
   ``Both of those places were objected to when they opened, but for
some legal reasons they were allowed to remain,'' said Siderowicz.
``Dad's Coffee Shop was something we could do something about, so we
did.''

   Siderowicz says it was also coincidental that the committee he
headed to collect the signatures was a group called ``Democrats for
Good and Honest Government,'' formed specifically to oust the
incumbents. And it did. All three who were running, including
Maholic.
   ``I guess I wasn't the only loser,'' Wasley commented. ``But if I
were confronted with a petition like that outside of church with all
those people standing around I'd have signed it myself.''
   Apart from his current troubles, Tom Wasley's career as a
restaurateur has not always been placid.
   He grew up in Mayfield, the next town over, and in 1978 opened a
short-order restaurant. It did well enough until two years later
when an elderly customer mistook the gas pedal for the brake and
drove his car through Wasley's front window.
   ``Nobody was hurt, but it killed my business. For some reason
people didn't want to come anymore.''
   So in 1985 he changed the operation. He borrowed money, put in a
bar, hired bands and stayed open until 2 a.m.
   ``That,'' he said, ``was my idea of live entertainment, and the
results were terrible. I had to break up three or four fights every
night and I had 11 break-ins the first year. I started 1986 deep in
debt and figured I'd have to shut down.
   ``A friend of mine asked me if I ever thought of go-go girls. I
told him I'd never even seen one. Besides, I couldn't see myself in
the role. I'm a guy with a mother who sings in the choir and says
the rosary every night and a son in parochial school.
   ``Well, I went with him to a go-go place in Scranton and nothing
I thought would happen happened. It was great. The girls joked; the
men behaved. I went three more times after that and finally decided
to try it.
   ``I tore up the floor where I had had a pool table and used it to
build a stage, and hired two girls, one for the afternoon and one
for the evening. No bands, just records.
   ``It was a success from the first day. No fights, everybody just
having fun. After two years I was finally back on my feet.
   ``Then one night _ I wasn't even there at the time _ a young guy
had to be ejected. He went out on the highway and was run over by a
pickup truck and killed.
   ``I swore right then I would never serve liquor again, never ever.
   ``That's when I got the idea for a coffee shop. A non-alcoholic
place where adults could stop in and chat over coffee. No music, no
entertainment. I opened last February and thought of it as an idea
that might be copied all over the country.''
   You would miss Dad's if you didn't know where it was. It is in a
business complex just off Main Street but hidden behind a video
store and a bank and squeezed between the Wah Yaon, a Chinese
takeout joint, and the My Place Pizza parlor. Wasley has a deal with
the pizza parlor. If one of his coffee customers wants a slice it
comes via a pass-through cut in the dividing wall. Wasley jacks up
the price a nickel and serves it.
   The front windows of Dad's are curtained and on the front door,
also curtained, is a sticker that says ``Say No to Drugs and
Alcohol.'' A sign says ``Must Be 18.'' ``I card 'em,'' says Wasley.
   The inside is well lit. Wasley did the carpentry himself, a
nondescript U-shape counter surrounded by 30 nondescript
plastic-cushioned chairs. The waitress one recent afternoon, a
blonde named Natasha, was not at all nondescript and was certainly
diverting and seemed to enjoy chatting with the customers.
   There were only four at the time, all men in their 30s or 40s who
managed not to stare. One, in fact, was reading a newspaper. Natasha
did not appear at all self-conscious. The conversation was about the
start of school. Natasha said she had just got her elder daughter
enrolled in a school for kids with learning disabilities and was
greatly relieved.
   She also said, with a sigh, that she hoped business would pick up
after 5 when the men got off work and were thirsty for coffee.
``Tips have been pretty scarce lately,'' she said.
   Natasha, are you entertainment?
   ``Not here,'' she said. ``I am at my other job. I dance. Here all
I do is serve coffee.''
   When Wasley first opened Dad's the girls wore bathing suits. ``A
rumor got started, probably by some of my former go-go customers,
that my waitresses were topless. I decided, if that's what they
want, why not?''
   Tina Wanis, 20, who is Wasley's fully clothed office manager,
points out there is good money in the topless business although she
would never do it herself. ``I just couldn't,'' she said.
   ``We pay our girls $10 an hour. When we were going good they made
another $50 to $60 on a six-hour shift in tips alone. Even for a
slow waitress, a $5 tip is not unusual.''
   But Dad's Coffee Shop certainly is. It remains to be seen whether
the idea will sweep the country.

   He's a bigger-than-life, lonely man whose
millions of dollars have allowed him an eclectic portfolio of
amusements. Meet Scott Chinery, who spent his youth building his
body and approaches 30 with more toys than F.A.O. Schwarz.
</TEXT>

   Never mind how Scott Chinery made his
money. Consider instead that he claims the largest collection of
pre-Castro Cuban cigars this side of Havana.
   He counts between 11,000 to 12,000 of them, some 30 to 40
different brands.
   Add to that about 100 guitars, dozens of valuable watches, 14
expensive cars, up to 3,500 comic books _ including first editions
of Batman and Superman _ and a Batmobile and a Batcycle with sidecar
from the 1960s television series. The latter two items cost him
$240,000, but with Batmania revived by the new movie he says he's
been offered $2 million for the car alone. He isn't selling.
   In short, Scott Chinery, a multimillionaire by age 29, is larger
than life.
   In fact, he's 6-feet-6 inches tall, weighs in at 275 pounds.
Shaking his hand is like grabbing hold of a small ham.
   He'd be smaller today, but as a kid he wanted to be bigger, and a
college football coach told him steroids would do it. He quickly
added 25 more pounds of muscle to an already impressive frame.
   That's how he made his money, selling what he calls a safe
alternative to steroids to others, who, like him, want to be bigger
than nature intended.
   The Batmobile investment brought him fame faster than steroids
put muscles on a 98-pound weakling.
   ``Want to go for a ride in the Batmobile?'' he offers. ``You can
be Robin.''
   A visitor to his palatial garage has to step past the Bentley
convertible, the Rolls-Royce, the Lamborghini Countash and the 1958
Thunderbird before getting to the sleek, black piece of television
Americana.
   The Bentley, incidentally, sports a $40,000 sound system, the
floor strewn with compact discs, including his favorites, the Judds.
``I'm in love with Naomi Judd,'' he confesses. The rest of his cars,
a mint condition 1962 VW bug and a 1961 Corvette among them, are
warehoused.
   The Batmobile, Chinery's prize possession, still bears its
``Gotham City'' license plates. Its sister vehicle, the only other
in existence, remains impounded in Australia where it was involved
in an accident.
   But at the risk of disappointing middle-age Bat fans, the
Batmobile is a stretch Thunderbird (14 inches longer), laden with
what are nothing more than Bat props.
   The red Bat Phone is just a metal facsimile held to the holder by
a magnet. The Bat Chute is just a red button. So are the Bat Ram,
the Bat Ray, the Bat Scanner, the Bat Detect-A-Scope and the
automatic tire repair.
   It's a virtual Bat sham. Only the television works, and it's
black-and-white.
   New York developer Donald Trump called one day to ask for a ride
in the Batmobile and Chinery agreed to a three block spin, from the
Plaza Hotel to the Trump Tower, providing Trump returned the favor
with a ride in his helicopter.
   As they soared over Manhattan, Chinery recounts, ``He said, `I'll
show you what I own,''' promptly pointing out just about everything
in sight.
   Now Chinery is ready to roll, but the Batmobile is out of gas. He
runs down the battery trying to start it.
   Like a kid with lots of toys but a short attention span, he moves
on to other pursuits and asks his aides to push it out of the
garage, pump some gas and give it a jump-start from the Batcycle.
   A ruthless practical joker, Chinery's home security system has
one camera trained on the front door. To torment visitors, he can
hit a button next to his desk and spray the unsuspecting callers
with water.
   For his daughter's first birthday, he ordered a full-fledged
circus for the back yard.

   At the end of a national television interview, Chinery, in the
midst of a divorce, confessed that being young and rich can get
lonely, and what he'd really like to collect is a kind and loving
wife.
   He received more than 24,000 calls on a toll-free line. Callers
were asked to send letters and pictures, and 12,000 did. Chinery
talked to 1,200 of them by phone and had dates with 34. He's dated
three of them more than once.
   His office is cluttered with the guitars _ one belonged to rock
star Rick Derringer and another to Eric Clapton _ and he collects
antique carnival games. A wooden Uncle Sam invites: ``Shake with
Uncle Sam. Only one cent. He will tell you the strength of your
grip.''
   But Chinery's penchant for adolescent pursuits ends when he talks
about steroids.
   He said he and others he knew often took massive doses, downing a
half bottle of black market steroids at a time.
   ``They were being misused then more than now, even though they're
more widely used now,'' he said.
   Normally easygoing, he recalls bouts of ``roid rage,'' an
uncharacteristic urge to destroy that often strikes steroid users.
   When a neighbor in his college dormitory refused to turn down his
music, ``I ripped the Sheetrock down but I couldn't fit between the
rafters. I went around through the door and then I pushed him
through the ceiling.''
   The steroids wreaked havoc on his body: He landed in the
hospital, ended a promising football career and dropped out of
college.
   Chinery came back with a vengeance. After spending years
researching safe alternatives to steroids, he marketed his product,
called Cybergenics, and quickly built a multimillion-dollar business.
   He started out as a shoestring mail-order operation. Now he
markets his product through 2,000 retail outlets in several
countries. He sells a sophisticated blend of amino acids and a
protein supplement, along with a workout guide and video _ sort of a
Jane Fonda of bodybuilding.
   He lists a litany of nasty side effects that steroids can cause:
liver damage, kidney damage, hair loss, enlarged breasts, impotence,
high blood pressure. And he campaigns actively against them.
   A handful of bodybuilding authorities say Chinery's product is a
useful alternative to steroids.
   Dominic Certo, former vice president of the International
Federation of Body Building and a former Mr. North America, said the
results at gyms have been good.
   ``I couldn't say scientifically that they're as effective as
steroids. I could say they're the best alternative to taking
drugs,'' Certo said.
   Robert Kennedy, publisher of the Toronto-based Muscle Mag
International, agrees.
   ``It doesn't work like steroids,'' Kennedy says. ``Steroids work
like a kind of magic. They'll kill you, of course, but the steroids
will give you immediate size within a day or two. The muscles just
become rock hard, and people get hooked on them.''
   Chinery knows the market he is appealing to is a vulnerable one.
   ``These people out there are so impressionable and so motivated _
motivated to the point of obsession,'' he says.
   These days Chinery is flexing his financial muscles in other
ventures.
   He's taken up charitable causes, working with epileptics and
terminally ill children.
   He couldn't find a decent car stereo store, so he opened his own
and installed a $40,000 sound system in his Bentley.
   He loves a good cigar, so he markets his own line.
   As he pulls out of his house in the Bentley, some teen-age girls
are parked out front.
   ``Hi Scott,'' they say in unison.
   ``They're not groupies,'' shrugs Chinery. ``I've got lots of
groupies, but unfortunately they're all skinny guys who want to be
big.''

   He's an opera tenor from Oklahoma who ``paid his
dues'' in Europe. Now, at age 37, Chris Merritt is on the verge of
achieving fame here in a field that has been dominated by Europeans.
But it has required years of hard work.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Move over Placido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti,
the next big name among operatic tenors may be as American as Chris
Merritt.
   While singers, like other entertainers, don't like to discuss
their income, it is generally believed that the 37-year-old Merritt
is paid more for an opera performance in Europe than either Domingo,
who is Spanish, or Pavarotti, who is Italian.
   Critics and audiences have been enthusiastic.
   The career of Merritt, a native of Oklahoma City who can sing a
high C and go on up to a D, began blossoming in Europe just as a
revival of Gioacchino Rossini operas began sweeping across the
Continent.
   Rossini operas need Merritt's kind of high, flexible voice _ a
tenor counterpart to the coloratura soprano.
   ``I was basically what people were looking for,'' says Merritt,
who has sung 17 roles in 14 Rossini operas.
   He'll make his debut at the Metropolitan Opera a year from this
fall in Rossini's ``Semiramide,'' starring mezzo-sporano Marilyn
Horne. Both of them are American singers who ``paid their dues'' in
Europe.
   Miss Horne says that Merritt can become famous if he wants to,
but operatic fame requires both voice and promotion.
   ``Both Luciano and Placido have worked very hard at being
famous,'' she says. ``They also had the goods.
   ``Chris has so many offers, to keep his sanity right now is the
main thing. He's singing in the bigger houses. He has records coming
out that will certainly fan the flame. If he wants to become famous,
he certainly has the possibility. He really is top of the line now.''
   Merritt says fate, an important ingredient in opera plots, played
an important role in getting him where he is now.
   His parents, who'd been through the Depression and who ``had a
high sense of the beautiful,'' provided violin lessons for their
daughter and acting lessons for their older son. Then both needed to
get regular jobs.
   By the time Chris arrived, 26 and 18 years younger than his
siblings, the family was better off financially. He studied piano,
art and dance and his parents could afford for him to pursue the
arts.
   He attended an Oklahoma City school with one of the city's best
choral programs. In the eighth grade he applied to play piano for
the boys chorus, but the director found a girl for that job, saying
he needed boys who could read music as singers. Chris Merritt had
never sung. He discovered he loved it.
   When Merritt went to Oklahoma City University, he says, ``I had a
vague idea what opera was.''
   A friend urged him to buy Joan Sutherland's ``Art of the Diva''
recording. He was instantly hooked on bel canto, which means
beautiful singing, and was the style composed by Rossini, Bellini
and Donizetti in the early 19th century. Merritt didn't dream he'd
make his Chicago Lyric Opera debut opposite Dame Joan in Donizetti's
``Anna Bolena.''
   He stretched his stay in college to eight years, studying all the
time with Inez Lunceford-Silberg. Not a teacher who rushes into
developing a pupil's top ``money notes,'' she at first let Merritt
sing in only two octaves, one above and one below the middle of his
register.
   ``Her emphasis was on trying to find the most natural and thus
the most beautiful way of singing, on producing sound that was the
healthiest for the physical vocal instrument,'' he says.
   ``After a year and a half, she let me do my first aria, one from
`Faust' that had a high C. I'd heard that the tenor high C was next
to impossible. I had a feeling of foreboding about trying it. It
came surprisingly easy for me.''
   Merritt met a mezzo-soprano, Joan Coplan, at college and they
fell in love. After breaking up at one point, they were married in
1978, the year he graduated from college. They have a daughter 10
and a son 9.
   Joan Coplan-Merritt resumed vocal lessons last year and is now
auditioning to start her career.
   Merritt had sung during the summers at the Santa Fe Opera's and
Wolftrap's apprentice programs, where American opera company heads
go to hear newcomers. None of them approached him, so he went to
Europe and auditioned for opera companies in Salzburg, Austria, and
Basel, Switzerland. Both offered contracts and he signed for three
years in Salzburg, which planned Rossini's ``The Italian Girl in
Algiers'' for opening night.
   After Salzburg, he spent the next three years in Augsburg, West
Germany. After that, he was well enough known to join the
international star circuit.
   In 1984, the Merritts moved to Baltimore, so their children could
attend school there.
   The 6-foot-2 tenor currently is dieting, on orders of his doctor
who found he had high blood pressure this summer.
   ``My first step into the big arena of opera'' is how Merritt
describes his 1981 debut with the New York City Opera in Bellini's
``I Puritani.''
   His wife read that Beverly Sills was looking for American singers
who'd had to go to Europe to sing opera. He wrote to her and, after
some mixups, auditioned for her in Munich, West Germany. She offered
a part in ``Puritani.''
   The Metropolitan Opera was planning a production of ``Puritani''
with Joan Sutherland and invited Merritt to audition. But Joan
Ingpen, then in charge of Met casting, turned him down. ``I forgot
about the Met for a while,'' Merritt says.
   In 1983, Marilyn Horne, who played a major part in the Rossini
revival, was to sing in three Rossini operas in concert form at
Carnegie Hall. Impresario Mathew Epstein suggested to her that she
hear Merritt.
   Merrit went to Venice, Italy, to sing for her and, ``She took me
under her wing as someone she wanted to present to the operatic
world.''
   Merritt made his Carnegie Hall debut in ``Tancredi'' with Miss
Horne and appeared with her in Rossini operas in Hamburg, West
Germany, London's Covent Garden, San Francisco and Los Angeles.
   ``If I believe in somebody, I'll stick my neck out for them,''
Miss Horne says. ``He's an easy one to stick your neck out for.
   ``Chris has a stentorian voice. He has that enormous gift of
extreme high notes, plus a huge range and when he gets into his low
register, he sounds like a baritone. He's extremely musical and a
very quick learner.
   ``The thing I love about Chris, too, is that he has paid his
dues. He's not a fly-by-night like you get with a lot of people.''

   It took a lot of hustle by a group of Connecticut
parents, but the national Little League organization finally
sanctioned a baseball program for handicapped youngsters. Similar
leagues have now been formed in towns in Texas, Kentucky and
Massachusetts.

   There were no hits, no runs and no errors.
But what made a recent baseball game perfect was that there were no
losers.
   That's just the way they like it in the Norwich Little League's
Special Needs Program, which was launched last year for disabled
youngsters between the ages of 6 and 15.
   ``Although it may not be as competitive as some of the other
leagues, that is not the issue,'' says Julie Sage of Norwich, whose
7-year-old son plays in the league. ``We never dreamed our kids
would have been able to play in anything like this.''
   During one recent game, Alfred ``A.J.'' Jonasch III, 15, who has
Down's syndrome, pounded his glove and pawed the infield dirt with
his cleats as he shouted at his teammates to ``get down on the
ball.''
   At the plate, 7-year-old Sam Sage, who has spinabifida, took a
left-handed cut at the ball, knocked it off the tee a short distance
from the pitcher's mound and then spun his wheelchair toward first
base.
   ``I like to bat, bat, bat,'' Sage said later.
   The two are among the 25 boys and girls who play in the league
every Sunday morning on fields shared with the girls' softball
leagues. Like Alfred and Sam, most of the players have Down's
syndrome or spinabifida, a malformation of the bones in the spine.
   Under league rules, batters hit the ball off a 3-foot tee and run
base paths that are a few feet shorter than the Little League
distance of 60 feet. They also use a ball that is softer than the
typical Little League hardball.
   In addition, scores aren't kept and outs aren't recorded. Each
team bats its entire lineup and then takes the field. Each game is
played for about an hour with no set number of innings required.
   Allowing the handicapped youngsters a chance to toe the rubber
and dig in at the plate was what Norwich Little League president
James B. Rusiecki envisioned when he first began putting the league
together in 1986.
   ``They have just as much enthusiasm and heart as any of the kids
playing ball,'' says Rusiecki, a supervisor at a Norwich naval
products company. ``Why should a child have to stay home because he
or she may not be as good as anyone else?''
   Rusiecki's proposal, born from the desire of some parents to give
their handicapped children a chance to play ball, did not become a
reality without a fight.
   The board of directors of Little League Baseball Inc., the
national organization, rejected the proposal for a special-needs
program in February 1987 and refused to sanction it, citing
insurance problems and the possible need for professional educators.
   It was only after a similar league in Brockton, Mass., threatened
legal action that Little League officials relented and granted
Norwich a charter as a pilot program in February 1988.
   The national organization, based in Williamsport, Pa., earlier
this year launched a Challenger Division for handicapped youngsters
between the ages of 6 and 18. The new division's structure was based
on the findings of a Challenger Division Task Force headed by U.S.
Sen. Robert Dole, R-Kan., which conducted a two-year study.
   Steve D. Keener, a spokesman for the national organization, said
leagues also are operating in Bristol, Conn., Spring, Texas,
Louisville, Ky., and Brockton, Mass.
   ``We just wanted to give handicapped youngsters the same
experience of playing Little League baseball,'' Keener says.
   A number of parents pushed for the creation of a league. Like the
parents of other Little Leaguers, they give up their Sunday mornings
to watch their sons and daughters play ball. Some serve as player
assistants, instructing youngsters on bases and in the field.
   ``I think it's a good idea for the handicapped to get an
opportunity to play,'' says Kenneth Patrick as he stood behind first
base, giving a mixture of encouragement and instruction to his
7-year-old daughter, Rose, one of his three mentally retarded
daughters that play in the league. ``I'm all for it.''
   The support the league has gained both from parents and the local
businesses that sponsor teams and donate equipment has led some
league officials to seek expansion next year.
   Gary Mathieu, an orderly at Seaside Regional Center in Waterford,
who helped put the teams together last year, said the league hopes
to expand to four, 5-player teams next year and create a division
for 16 to 18 year olds.
   The goal, Mathieu said, is to make the program more competitive
and more in line with the traditional game of hits, runs and errors.
Smaller teams also allow for more individualized attention, he says.
   ``Each child would have a coach and they could become more
active,'' he says. ``We would like to teach the difference between a
fair ball and a foul ball and keep scores of the games. Right now
they are both winners and there are no losers.''
   Barbara M. Sullivan, a Norwich physical therapist who helped
start the league and serves as its technical adviser, says the
program should expand to create integrated teams, those mixing
handicapped and non-handicapped players. She tried to start an
integrated team for 4 to 6 year olds in the Norwich T-Ball League in
1982, but was turned down.
   ``This is just a foot in the door,'' says Sullivan, who operates
the Norwich Rehabilitation Center. ``We would not like to have a
separate league, but eventually integrate some players into the
regular team system.''
   But many of the youngsters are not worried about the score or
even winning or losing. They frequently exchange greetings when they
reach base and seem just as interested in socializing during the
one-hour games as playing.
   ``I like playing, but I also like being with the kids,'' says
12-year-old Lucy Waters of Montville, shyly pulling her Red Sox cap
down over her eyes.

   Elizabeth Taylor sees no parallel between her
own life and that of the woman she portrays in a new television
version of the Tennessee Williams play ``Sweet Bird of Youth.''
   In the movie, to be shown on NBC on Sunday, Taylor plays Princess
Alexandra Del Lago, a faded movie star seeking solace in booze,
drugs and affairs with young men.
   During a rare interview at her Bel-Air home, Taylor is asked if
she ever considered that she might be compared to Alexandra.
   ``That never occurred to me,'' she says, lounging on a couch in a
purple gown, with her bare feet tucked beneath her. ``We're both
actresses. She believes her career is over. I've never felt that.
She's a desperate lady. My desperation, if I've ever had it, had
nothing to do with my career.''
   After a long pause, she looks up from a cup of tea and adds,
``Other people may draw comparisons because we're both actresses.''
   Her black hair is done in a hairdo with lots of spikes. Her
complexion is darker than it appears on screen and she apparently
has gained a few pounds since her famous weight loss. But her violet
eyes are luminous, probing, mesmerizing.
   Typically, she refuses to discuss her private life, her many
marriages and divorces, her life-threatening illnesses, and her
problems with drugs and alcohol.
   Currently unmarried, Taylor has been romantically linked in
recent months to millionaire publisher Malcolm Forbes. They have
been frequently seen together and last month she was hostess of
sorts at his $2 million party in Morocco.
   Taylor says it took her 30 years to grow into the role Tennessee
Williams always wanted her to play in ``Sweet Bird.'' She was only
27 when the playwright created Alexandra.
   ``He wanted me to do this, but I wasn't right for it until now,''
says Taylor, who has had starring roles in four Williams plays.
   ``I love doing Tennessee Williams,'' she says. ``I love his way
with words and language, the way he has characters feed off each
other. And eat off each other. His dark side is dramatic and there
is a wonderful black humor in everything he writes.
   ``Now, the age is right for me. Everything was just right. If I
had been thinner I would have had to put on weight. My acting style
is instinctive and I try to become the person I'm playing.
   ``I found this part terrifying because of her sadness and despair
and lack of control. Once I got started, however, I found it was
easy and no longer frightening. I loved doing this character.''
   Taylor's long association with Williams began in 1958 when she
played Maggie the Cat in the movie version of ``Cat on a Hot Tin
Roof'' with Paul Newman and Burl Ives. She was Katharine Hepburn's
mad niece in ``Suddenly, Last Summer,'' which also starred
Montgomery Clift. She and her then-husband, Richard Burton, made
``Boom'' in 1968, the film version of ``The Milk Train Doesn't Stop
Here Anymore.''
   ``Sweet Bird of Youth'' made its Broadway debut in 1959 with
Geraldine Page as Alexandra. Page also starred in the 1962 movie
with Paul Newman as Chance, her latest and most dangerous conquest.
Ed Begley won an Oscar for his role as Boss Tom Finley.
   Mark Harmon is Chance in the two-hour NBC version. Boss Finley is
played by Rip Torn, who was Tom Finley Jr. on the stage and in the
movie and was married to Page. Michael Wilding, Taylor's son, has a
small role as a producer who tries to lure Alexandra back to
Hollywood.
   Taylor was doing ``Boom'' on location in Sardinia when Williams
first suggested she do the role of Alexandra. She decided she wasn't
right yet, but in 1981 she considered doing it on the stage.
Instead, she did Lillian Hellman's ``The Little Foxes'' on Broadway.
``Sweet Bird of Youth'' was later re-staged in New York and London.
   Taylor says she saw Alexandra as a very selfish and vain creature.
   ``Her saving grace is her sense of humor, which she does have,''
Taylor says. ``But in her selfishness, which she does pull out of at
the end because she really does care for Chance, she was quite
single-minded in the beginning. She was consumed with self-pity.
   ``She takes this young lover and doesn't know who he is at first.
Then she develops a real sense of compassion for him and realizes
the terrible danger he's in. She really tries to help him, but he's
bent on his own self-destruction.''
   In recent years, Taylor has appeared on television more than the
movie screen. She scoffs at the idea that she might do a series,
however.
   ``It's simply too much work,'' she says. ``That's why I like
television movies, because they're short, then they're over with. My
preference is to do only one thing a year.''
   Her last feature film, ``Toscanini,'' was released in Europe, but
according to some reports may never open in this country. She has
appeared regularly in TV movies, as well as the miniseries ``North
and South,'' and made guest appearances on the ABC series ``Hotel''
and the ABC soap opera ``General Hospital.''
   Taylor spends much of her time promoting her perfume, ``Elizabeth
Taylor's Passion.'' She says she chose its fragrance of Oriental
floral herself with the help of a French chemist. She is also
bringing out a man's cologne with a ``woodsy, citrusy'' fragrance.

   The story of Michael Bennett is the story of the
American musical theater during the last 25 years.
   As a dancer, choreographer and director, Bennett had an impact on
Broadway that still reverberates more than two years after his death
from AIDS at the age of 44.
   From his first appearance on Broadway in 1961 in the chorus of
``Subways Are for Sleeping'' to 1986 when he withdrew as director
from the London production of ``Chess,'' Bennett defined what it was
like to make musicals move.
   Now his career has been dissected by Ken Mandelbaum in ```A
Chorus Line' and the Musicals of Michael Bennett'' (St. Martin's
Press), a detailed and fascinating new book about the man's career
and the musicals he appeared in and helped to create.
   Mandelbaum, a former Brooklyn high school teacher, columnist for
``Theater Week'' magazine and musical theater buff extraordinaire,
looks at all of Bennett's shows, from the more conventional efforts
like ``Promises, Promises,'' ``Coco'' and ``Seesaw'' to his work on
two Sondheim masterpieces, ``Company'' and ``Follies.''
   But the book's centerpiece is an exhaustive examination of ``A
Chorus Line,'' the story of dancers auditioning for the chorus of a
Broadway show. The musical is currently in its 15th year at New
York's Shubert Theater and will reach performance number 6,000
before the end of the year.
   ``I always wondered why there wasn't a book on `A Chorus Line' _
either a big coffee-table script with lots of pictures or a book
about the making of the show because it was such a unique process,''
Mandelbaum was saying the other day. ``It revolutionized the way
musicals were made.''
   The show was born of highly personal and painful revelations. It
was based on some 24 hours of tape recordings made by Broadway
dancers talking about their lives, loves, hates, successes, failures
and what it was like to dance in the chorus of a Broadway show.
   Mandelbaum painstakingly traces the musical's evolution. It began
with those first sessions, initially proposed by dancers Tony
Stevens and Michon Peacock and then embraced by Bennett. It looks at
the development of the book by Nicholas Dante and James Kirkwood and
the music and lyrics by Marvin Hamlisch and Ed Kleban. More
important, the author shows how the musical was shaped and honed by
Bennett in a series of workshops.
   Bennett didn't invent the idea of workshops. Many plays,
particularly off-Broadway, had been developed by that method. But
starting with ``A Chorus Line,'' he used it to create musicals.
   Mandelbaum's book is deliberately non-personal. There are
private, even touching moments in it, but the focus of the book is
the work, not the man.
   ``His life was his art,'' Mandelbaum says. ``I wanted to do a
study of a career.''
   The author began the book in September 1987, two months after
Bennett's death. He did a month or two of research, mostly at the
performing arts library at Lincoln Center, and then took five or six
months to conduct interviews, more than 70 in all, with people who
had worked with Bennett.
   Some of them, like Katharine Hepburn, who starred in ``Coco,''
declined to be interviewed. So did many original cast members of ``A
Chorus Line.''
   ``With four or five exceptions, they were the most difficult to
get to,'' Mandelbaum says. ``Some of them never really got over `A
Chorus Line.' It put them in a position that they really weren't
accustomed to and maybe they shouldn't have been in. Michael made
them look like these fascinating people. After that, there was
really no follow-up. So it was hard for them to talk about it.
   ``And because the book used their lives, to a degree, from the
tapes, they feel exploited by the show. Even though, as you know,
Michael gave them all royalties. More than one of them told me, `We
were exploited by that show and I don't want to be exploited
anymore.'''
   Stardom has eluded all of the original cast members of ``A Chorus
Line,'' although many continue to work in musical theater.
   ``None of them has had a role that showed them off the way that
show did,'' Mandelbaum says. ``I think what happened to those people
is a perfect example of how hard it is nowadays to find steady work
on Broadway.
   ``That's one reason why `Chorus Line' is so interesting. It's a
show about Broadway and dancers and performers. And what happened to
them is the whole story of Broadway in that period.''
   Mandelbaum never met Bennett.
   ``I came to think that was an advantage,'' he says now. ``I could
listen to what everyone was telling me about him without any ax to
grind or personal feelings to color it. So when people told me the
way he affected them _ both good and bad _ I could just sort of take
it in.
   ``But by the time I was finished with the book, I did feel I
really knew him.''
   One of the most intriguing aspects of Mandelbaum's book is his
chapter on ``Scandal,'' the Bennett musical that might-have-been.
The show, which had a book by television writer Treva Silverman and
music and lyrics by Jimmy Webb, tells of one woman's sexual
liberation. It never got beyond several workshop productions and was
canceled abruptly in 1985, most think, because Bennett learned he
was dying of AIDS.
   ``I truly believe that `Scandal' would have been fabulous,''
Mandelbaum says. ``The staging would have been so unusual. It had
long 20-minute sequences, a lot like `Lady in the Dark,' which were
the woman's fantasies.
   ``The book of the musical is very funny. And everyone insisted
the choreography was the greatest of Michael's career, unbelievably
beautiful, aesthetic-looking and pure. His stuff was so moral and
pristine that it made the sex and the wild and lewd comedy in the
show work. Everyone connected with it insisted that the show would
not have offended anyone. It would have made them think about right
and wrong.''
   Whatever the promise of ``Scandal,'' it was never realized, and
Bennett never staged another musical.
   But the saga of Michael Bennett is not likely to end _ at least
not in print. More Bennett books are in the making. Already out is
``The Untold Story Behind the Making of `A Chorus Line,''' (Bantam
Books) by Denny Martin Flinn, a dancer who appeared in a national
tour of the musical.
   Kevin Kelly, theater critic for The Boston Globe, has ``The
Michael Bennett Story'' arriving from Doubleday early next year.
Next March will mark the appearance of ``On the Line'' by Robert
Viagas (William Morrow). Subtitled ``The Creation of `A Chorus
Line','' it will be the memoirs of 19 original cast members of the
long-running show.

<TEXT>
   King Hussein is pushing Jordan toward its
first nationwide elections in 22 years, an event that could
transform a country crucial to the Middle East's balance of power.
   More than 1,000 candidates are testing their chances for the the
80 Parliament seats at stake Nov. 8 as a push toward greater
democracy and looser government control sweeps across the kingdom.
Martial law has been in place since the 1967 war with Israel.
   ``People are hungry for elections, for participation, after a
long absence,'' said Taher Masri, who resigned as deputy prime
minister in August in order to seek a seat from Amman. Active
Cabinet ministers are not allowed to run.
   The new Parliament will replace one originally elected in April
1967, two months before the Six Day War with Israel, and then became
largely ineffective. The body was suspended by Hussein in times of
difficulty and then lost about half its membership when the king
renounced Jordan's claim to the West Bank last year. No West Bankers
will be allowed to run for the new Parliament and candidates who do
run cannot do so under the banners of political parties, which have
been banned since an attempted coup in 1957.
   The election, however, accompanies a basic change in the nature
of the Jordan itself.
   Hussein's renunciation to claims to the West Bank, seized by
Israel in 1967, ended Jordan's main rivalry with the Palestine
Liberation Organization and helped accelerate a thrust toward
settlement of the 40-year-old Arab-Israeli conflict.
   Hussein's Hashemite kingdom of about 3 million people _ roughly
half of them Palestinians _ has now turned inward in a struggle to
reform an economy saddled with $8.3 billion in debts, a battle
dramatized by widespread rioting in April against economic hardship
and government repressiveness.
   ``This is a turning point in our life,'' candidate Masri said.
``The past era is gone and gone probably forever.''
   Liberals like Masri say the elections should lay the groundwork
for a stable, constitutional monarchy with a working Parliament to
thresh out grievances.
   The outgoing 60-member Parliament was suspended in 1974, then
revived in 1984, with a handful of local elections to replace
members who had died.
   Hussein scrapped the Parliament altogether last year as part of
his renunciation of claims to the West Bank. The economic riots
prodded the government to advance the date for the elections.
   Most previous Parliaments were little more than
government-dominated talking shops. But Masri and other officials
resigned from powerful posts to run in the elections, indicating
their faith that the new body will have a significant role.
   Skeptics fear, however, the voting could once again unleash
radical emotions among frustrated Palestinian refugees and
unemployed youngsters like those who threatened to rip the kingdom
apart in the late 1950s and again in 1970.
   Jordan's ability to cope with change is vital to any Arab peace
with Israel, whose longest border is with Jordan. Many in the
kingdom still have family and economic ties with the occupied West
Bank and with the Gaza Strip, which was administered by Egypt until
Israel seized it in the 1967 war.
   Jordan is also a vital buffer between four strategic countries:
Israel, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Iraq. It separates the powderkeg of
the Arab-Israeli conflict from the world's main sources of oil.
   The Palestinian guerrillas who tried to topple Hussein in 1970
are today more allies than rivals and are taking a hands-off
approach to the elections.
   While roughly half of Jordanians are from Palestinian families,
many over the past 40 years have come to identify with Jordan, the
only Arab country to give them passports.
   The royal family's descent from Islam's prophet, Mohammed, has
always helped blunt radical Islamic dissent.
   Hussein has patched up his frayed relations with the conservative
Moslem Brotherhood, the country's largest independent political
force.
   But some officials, who use a widespread intelligence and police
network to stifle radical dissenters, remain concerned about
potential Islamic extremism.
   The government does not feel secure enough to lift the ban on
political parties or martial law. Even government critics are wary
of too much change too fast.
   Laith Shubeilat, an independent Islamic activist who heads the
engineers association, argued that no one is ``ready to make a
dramatic change. The change should be slow.''
   Jordan was remarkably stable for most of the 1980s, thanks to
prosperity fed by income sent home by 350,000 Jordanian workers in
the Persian Gulf and grants from oil-producing Arab nations there.
   Falling oil prices squeezed that flow of money in recent years,
and Jordan borrowed to keep up spending on arms and luxury goods.
The resulting debt crashed down on the country last year. Prices for
imports soared as the dinar currency's value fell. Local wages were
stagnant.
   Anger at rising prices and perceived government arrogance boiled
over in April when riots erupted in the south, the rural heartland
of Hussein's support.

<HEAD>AMMAN: Hussein's support.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Hussein fired Prime Minister Zaid Rifai's government and promised
democratic reforms.
   He staved off economic collapse by cajoling more than $350
million in grants from alarmed Persian Gulf states, and his
ministers reached a series of debt-rescheduling agreements with
international lenders.
   The dinar, which plunged to $1 in July from a high of about $3
early last year, moved back up to about $1.50.
   But economists say Jordan faces years of austerity and high
unemployment.
   That is a dangerous prospect for an ambitious young generation
whose European-standard educational level is one of Jordan's
greatest assets.
   Hundreds of graduates, many of them jobless, line up daily
outside the U.S. Embassy to apply for visas.
   In Maan, where the economic riots broke out, people interviewed
recently said the edge had gone off their wrath, although anger at
the police remains.
   ``The people are satisfied now,'' said 26-year-old Aqab Khatib,
son of a prominent clan leader.
   The criticism that stormed around Prime Minister Rifai
occasionally crept upward to touch Hussein, Crown Prince Hassan and
Queen Noor, who were accused of condoning government abuses and of
wasting money.
   Despite frequent medical checkups, the 53-year-old monarch still
appears vigorous. In early September, he set a course record in an
automobile hillclimb and is seen repeatedly on television touring
towns and military bases.
   Hussein has ridden out the Middle East's turbulence and escaped
several assassination attempts in 35 years on the throne.
   But his health and survival remain constant subjects of
speculation in a country so closely identified with its ruler.
   Political analyst Rami Khoury, former editor of the Jordan Times,
said the country ``is on the verge of a new stage of political
participation'' no matter who reigns.
   Hussein's Oxford-educated brother Hassan, heir to the throne,
lacks the king's popularity, but he has championed the sort of
openness that reformers have demanded.
   The only major power base that might challenge the monarchy, the
army, remains fiercely loyal by all accounts.
   The king has more time to cement that loyalty following his
renunciation of claims to the West Bank and his retreat from 20
years as a starring player in frustrated Arab-Israeli peace efforts.
   The 21-month-old anti-Israeli uprising in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip shattered the last vestiges of loyalties to Jordan among the
950,000 West Bank Palestinians.
   Hussein cast their fate to the PLO, prodding that organization to
declare a state roughly encompassing the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip and to meet U.S. conditions for talks, ending a 13-year
boycott.
   Yet Jordan remains crucial to any settlement and the king holds
the power to sway events.
   Americans and Israelis want Jordan as a watchdog over the 1.7
million Palestinians on the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip to help
prevent an independent Palestinian state.
   The PLO proposes an eventual confederation of equals between
Jordan and that state. Israeli hardliners led by former Defense
Minister Ariel Sharon want to make Jordan itself a Palestinian
state, an idea bitterly opposed by most Jordanians and Palestinians.
   Hussein's nightmare is the call by some Israeli radicals to push
West Bank Palestinians into his kingdom, swamping it with refugees
for a third time to threaten the Hashemite throne.

   Here are some important dates in the history of Jordan:
   1916-18 _ Emir Hussein Bin Ali of Mecca and his sons revolt
against Turkish rule during World War I with the aid of Britain,
which promises them a vast postwar Arab kingdom.
   1920 _ Britain reneges on promises and cuts up the area with the
French in a postwar mandate. The French expel Emir Hussein's son
Feisal as king of Syria (British later make him king of Iraq).
Feisal's brother Abdullah arrives in what later becomes Jordan.
   1921 _ Britain separates the new emirate of Transjordan from the
Ottoman territories of Syria, Hejaz and Palestine and persuades a
reluctant Abdullah to become emir of the British protectorate on a
six-month trial basis.
   1937 _ Abdullah is the only major Arab leader to endorse a call
for partitioning Palestine into Jewish and Arab sectors, the Arab
sector to be ruled by Transjordan.
   1946 _ Transjordan gains independence from Britain, with Abdullah
as king.
   1948 _ Abdullah's British-led Arab Legion joins the war against
newly established Israel and holds onto the West Bank and East
Jerusalem. With the new territories, the kingdom changes its name to
Jordan in 1950. Palestinian refugees flood country.
   1951 _ Abdullah is assassinated by disgruntled Palestinian
nationalists and his son Talal takes the throne.
   1952 _ Talal abdicates because of mental illness and the throne
passes to Abdullah's grandson, the 17-year-old Hussein, who takes up
power in 1953 after reaching his 18th birthday by the Islamic
calendar.
   1956 _ Hussein expels British military officers, holds free
elections. Leftist sentiment sweeps the Arab world as Israel,
Britain and France attack Egypt in the Suez War.
   1957 _ Hussein squashes a leftist coup and bans political parties.
   1958 _ Hussein's cousin, King Faisal, is assassinated in a
leftist coup in Iraq. British troops help protect Jordan.
   1967 _ Hussein joins Egypt and Syria in the war against Israel
and loses the West Bank and East Jerusalem. More than 200,000
Palestinian refugees flood the kingdom. Hussein imposes martial law.
   1970 _ Hussein's army crushes Palestinian guerrillas who had
threatened his throne during fighting that became known as ``Black
September.'' The army also beats back a Syrian invasion.
   1973 _ Jordan sends a token force to help Syria in the fourth
Arab-Israeli war.
   1974 _ The Arab League recognizes the Palestine Liberation
Organization as sole representative of the Palestinians. Hussein
responds by suspending Parliament, half of which represents West
Bank Palestinians.
   1978 _ Jordan, left out of U.S.-sponsored Egypt-Israel peace

<HEAD>With BC-Jordan's Future, b0654-b0655</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are brief sketches of key figures in
Jordan's royal family:
   KING HUSSEIN _ The grandson of Jordan's founder, King Abdullah,
the 53-year-old monarch has ruled for 36 of Jordan's 41 years of
independence. His family draws its legitimacy from its history as
guardians of Mecca, Islam's holiest city, and its descent from the
Prophet Mohammed.
   QUEEN NOOR _ The American-born daughter of former Pan Am airlines
Chairman Najeeb Halaby, an Arab-American, she met Hussein while
doing contract work for Royal Jordanian Airways and married him in
1979. Hussein's fourth wife, she has given him four children: Prince
Hamzeh, 9; Prince Hashim, 8; Princess Iman, 6; and Princess Raiyah,
3. The Princeton-educated queen, 38, sponsors women's societies,
social work and arts. She also acts as a goodwill ambassador.
   CROWN PRINCE HASSAN _ The younger of Hussein's two brothers,
Hassan, 42, was named crown prince in 1965 while earning a degree in
Oriental studies at Oxford in England. Noted as the palace
intellectual, he oversees economic development and sponsors seminars
on a wide range of topics. He is married to the Pakistani-born
Princess Tharwat. They have four children, although the royal line
is due to return to Hussein's offspring.
   QUEEN ZEIN _ The queen mother, she was the wife of the late King
Talal, Hussein's father, who abdicated due to mental illness in
1952. She was an important adviser in the early days of Hussein's
reign, but now in her 70s, plays a low-key role.
   PRINCE ALI _ Hussein's eldest child by an Arab mother, the late
Queen Alia, Ali, 13, is designated to become king after Hassan. The
remainder of the line of succession is open to constitutional
interpretation of the question of the children having non-Arab
mothers, the American-born Queen Noor and the British-born Princess
Muna, Hussein's previous wife.
   PRINCE ABDULLAH _ Hussein's eldest child, he was named crown
prince at birth in 1962, but the title was later given to Hassan due
to political turmoil at the time and because Abdullah's mother,
British-born Princess Muna, Hussein's second wife, was not Arab. The
prince, 27, has inherited Hussein's interest in rally-car racing and
flying. He attended prep schools in the United States, studied at
Britain's Sandhurst military academy and is an army lieutenant. He
sometimes acts as regent when both Hussein and Hassan are abroad.
   PRINCE FAISAL _ Hussein's second son by Muna, Faisal, 25, is an
air force pilot who won honors at a military training course in
Britain. He studied electrical engineering at Brown University in
Providence, R.I., and has played an increasingly visible role,
sometimes acting as regent.

   ``Dead Calm'' (Warner Home Video. VHS-Beta, $89.95. Rated R)
   
   The sea can be sinister or serene. For John and Rae Ingram, it's
both.
   After the death of their only child, killed in a car crash that
almost claims the mother as well, the couple take to the high seas
in their ketch to mend their emotions and soothe their lives.
   They are becalmed somewhere in the Pacific _ the movie is an
Australian production _ when they suddenly spot a dinghy whose
passenger is frantically rowing away from a listing schooner.
   This is the starting point for ``Dead Calm,'' a thriller played
out by only three characters with the sea as its only setting. Such
containment can often stifle a film, making it claustrophobic and
slow. Here, however, the closeness adds to the story's inherent
tension.
   The stranger, Hughie Warriner (Billy Zane), tells the Ingrams a
bizarre tale: His shipmates have all died from food poisoning, the
engine and radio conked out and he was left with the corpses in a
becalmed sea. Hence his manic behavior and eagerness not to go back
to the ship.
   John (Sam Neill), a naval officer, doesn't believe him and rows
over to the injured ship. Before leaving he tells Rae (Nicole
Kidman) to take the rifle out of a locker in the cockpit and to use
it if necessary.
   As John unravels the terror that happened on the schooner, Rae
begins her own nightmarish journey. Hughie is a psychopath who has
killed all on board the other ship. He makes Rae his captive and
sets sail, leaving John presumably to die.
   For anyone who sails, ``Dead Calm'' is a scary notion. But it
suffers from a flawed script. Why, for example, is it necessary to
set up the story with the death of their child? It is soon forgotton
and serves no purpose other than to establish a lengthy holiday for
the parents, who could have taken the trip for any reason, including
a happy one. And Rae, who is equally as suspicious of Hughie, does
not immediately take out the rifle, even though she constantly eyes
the locker.
   Still, the excitement is there as John uses his wits, body and
experience to get the schooner under way, and to manually empty the
bilge before the boat sinks.
   Nicole Kidman, a young Australian actress, offers a fresh
sensuality. She is determined and keeps her wits. Her final solution
to the Hughie problem is a great moment on film.
   Based on the Charles Williams' book by the same name, ``Dead
Calm'' is produced by George Miller (``Mad Max,'' ``The Witches of
Eastwick''), and directed by Phillip Noyce. There's some excellent
photography by Dean Semler of the waters off the Great Barrier Reef,
as well as good sailing footage. ``Dead Calm'' is rated R for
violence, nudity and a brief sexual encounter.

   ``Tequila Sunrise'' (Warner Home Vide. VHS-Beta, $89.95. Rated R)
   
   The Los Angeles horizon never looked so good as it does in Robert
Towne's ``Tequila Sunrise.'' Even on the small screen, its amber and
ruby glow inspires.
   And that's the good news.
   The bad news is that ``Tequila Sunrise'' crawls along with an
excellent cast and a plot that could make a lot more than it does of
drug dealing, a romantaic triangle and a triple-cross.
   Mel Gibson, once one of the city's top drug dealers, has retired
from the business, much to the chagrin of local police authorities
who will do anything to still nail him.
   But no one really wants Gibson to quit _ not the cops, not his
old contacts, not his customers.
   His old high school and surfing buddy, Kurt Russell, is a
narcotics cop and he's out to get Gibson anyway he can. That
includes luring Michelle Pfeiffer, a restaurant owner he suspects is
involved professionally and personally with Gibson, into bed.
   Then there's Raul Julia, the bigtime Mexican drug connection who
poses as a top government crime fighter.
   Gibson finds himself in two triangles: one with the ruthless
Julia on one side and Russell and crooked federal agents on the
other; and one with Russell and Pfeiffer.
   It's a talky movie with little action. But the cinematography is
great.
   The actors do their best with muddled characterizations. Gibson
is likeable and watchable but needs more flesh in his dialogue.
Russell is very GQ. Pfeiffer is a beautiful, understated class act.
   
   As for the title, Gibson drinks a tequila sunrise (orange juice,
lime, grenadine and tequila) every now and then in the movie. So
much for bartending 101.

   Madrigals by Sigismondo d'India, Claudio Monteverdi; Chiaroscuro
and London Baroque, directed by Nigel Rogers (EMI)
   
   Italian madrigals as an art form display perhaps the most perfect
marriage of words and music. They are poems in song, in which
musical notes paint pictures of language.
   How particularly infuriating, then, that this otherwise excellent
recording contains only a German translation of the Italian text.
What about us English-speakers, not to mention French?
   Yet even those monolingual among us can generally recognize words
such as ``crudel,'' ``amore'' and ``morte.'' We don't even need to
know their meaning with the dramatic, vivid interpretation by
Chiaroscuro, the vocal ensemble consisting of tenor and director
Nigel Rogers, two sopranos, bass, a counter-tenor and second tenor.
   Their performance strikes a nice balance between the
over-homogenized quality of some ensembles and the over-wrought,
extra-dramatized readings of others.
   This disc shows us music by one of the best-known Italian
madrigalists, Monteverdi, and the obscure d'India, and presents them
in two guises. On the first half, we hear the more familiar,
ensemble-sung madrigal; the second half contains music that points
to opera _ works in which singers take on roles, sometimes limited
to two or three voices.
   The high point of this disc is Monteverdi's ``Hor che'l ciel e la
terra,'' a stunning setting of a Petrarch sonnet. In the space of 14
lines, the music moves from a slow, eerie opening to a series of
loudly declaimed words to a florid, rapid section and finally to the
long, beautiful cadence on the last word, ``lunge.'' Emotions vary
from word to word. It's as if the range of a three-hour opera is
compressed into nine minutes. The performance is masterful.
   For those familiar with this repertoire, the presence of the
rarely heard d'India _ who called himself the ``Noble Palermitano''
_ should prove welcome. His musical language is simpler and less
ornate, his lines more extended.

   ``World in Motion'' (Elektra) _ Jackson Browne
   
   The album opens with a funky beat and Jackson Browne singing,
``Sun going down on the USA.'' Party time, right? Let's dance! After
all, the name of the song is ``World in Motion.''
   But wait. ``Now we awake with a world at stake,'' Browne sings.
So this is not good-time music; it's an entreaty to BMW owners.
   Browne's fountain of sorrow has become a mountain of fret. It
includes the homeless, hunger and hatred, gangs and greed, war and
weapons.
   Browne obviously reads the paper, but the record exposes a
certain naivete, such as when he rails against the need for nuclear
weapons on ``How Long.'' On the title cut, he volunteers to help the
world realize its potential.
   Still, heart and sincerity count for something; ``World in
Motion'' has plenty of both. And musically, the record is terrific.
``Anything Can Happen,'' for example, is one of Browne's loveliest
melodies. ``Chasing You Into the Light'' is a catchy rocker.
   The final cut, ``Lights and Virtue,'' includes a sizzling guitar
duel between Browne and Kevin Dukes, as well as the album's most
assured lyric. ``Here's to truths yet to be known ... the search for
things of your own,'' Browne sings.
   On ``World in Motion,'' such abstract sentiments have the truest
ring.

   Smirks, wisecracks, lazy charm. Bruce Willis
calls them his tools, what carried him through four seasons of
``Moonlighting'' and last year's hit action film ``Die Hard.''
   But the 34-year-old actor is tired of just playing for laughs.
Now, thinking about how future audiences will remember him, Willis
balances his admiration for the Three Stooges with a desire to
portray enduring dramatic characters.
   So he welcomed the chance to start from scratch with Warner
Bros.' ``In Country,'' playing the troubled Vietnam War veteran,
Emmett.
   ``I was pretty scared, and I didn't really know if I could do
it,'' Willis said in a recent interview.
   ``Look, if I had done 4{ years of a guy who was angst-ridden and
was carrying around a lot of weight, I would have waltzed through
this thing. But on each step I had to make sure I was taking the
right step.''
   The boyish grin and urbane looks that Willis had as David Addison
in ``Moonlighting'' has disappeared for ``In Country.'' Instead,
there's a ``Fu Manchu'' mustache, long, slicked-back hair and a
dull, pained expression in his eyes. Fans may be shocked, but Willis
sees it as part of his job.
   ``That's what actors are supposed to be doing. If you're not
taking risks, you might as well work in TV. TV doesn't require you
to take any risk, that's why I went after this film,'' he said.
   ``I had just done 4{ years of playing the same guy, the same
character. I wasn't taking any risk at all. I wanted to do something
I wasn't sure I could do.''
   Television is a bad memory for Willis, who insists only his
contract kept him from leaving ``Moonlighting'' after the second
season. He worried that the public would know him only for one role,
that his abilities would be eaten up from the demands of producing
new material each week.
   ``Glenn (Gordon Caron, executive producer) said after the first
year we'd come to a point where there's nothing left to say. He knew
even then. It was bound to happen. It's a very cyclical thing,''
Willis said.
   ``You're just pouring yourself into this thing. I was concerned I
was going to use all my stuff on this show, that we were going to
exhaust ourselves.''
   Emmett was like an old friend for Willis, who met several Vietnam
vets while bartending in his native New Jersey. Like Sam (Emily
Lloyd), Emmett's teen-age niece in ``In Country'' who begs her uncle
to talk about the war, Willis wanted to learn what happened in
Vietnam.
   ``I've been researching this character for a long time,'' he
said. ``I have always been fascinated with the war itself, the
effect it had on American guys. I know what makes most of us what we
are, but I saw there was something different, that they saw
something there that freaked them out.
   ``I found things I had no idea I was ever going to find. I found
out things about myself, things about the Vietnam War. That's one of
the really unique things about acting, if you make yourself work
hard enough in this direction, you're going to find things you never
heard of.''
   Up to now, his style has been patterned on the breezy, detached
leading men of 1930s and '40s romantic comedies, actors such as
William Powell, Clark Gable and, especially, Cary Grant.
   ``He's the king,'' Willis said. ``His comic timing was superb,
even in films that didn't do so well, like `Arsenic and Old Lace.' I
could never figure how he did it.''
   Willis admired Grant's resourcefulness, the way he gently
manipulated the other characters in such classics as ``The
Philadelphia Story'' and ``The Awful Truth.'' He tried to use the
same techniques in ``Moonlighting,'' playing off the straight-laced
Cybill Shepherd.
   ``I always thought if you could make somebody laugh, you could
get them off balance, and if you could get them off balance, you
could get what you want from them,'' he said.
   While ``Moonlighting'' drew on the snappy dialogue of Grant's
movies, ``In Country'' was based on the spare language of Bobbie Ann
Mason's best-selling novel. Willis credited director Norman Jewison
(``Moonstruck,'' ``In the Heat of the Night'') with fine-tuning his
character.
   ``You can't play stoicism,'' Willis said, ``You can't play
somebody that sits there like a mope. You have to have something
coming out. So much of what my character had to communicate in this
film was done non-verbally.''
   Personally and professionally, he'll be busy for the coming year.
Willis is married to actress Demi Moore, who gave birth to daughter
Rumer Glenn during the filming of ``In Country.''
   A sequel to ``Die Hard'' is planned, and his second album, ``If
It Don't Kill You, It Makes You Stronger,'' comes out this fall.
   Willis also ponders life.
   ``I think about dying,'' he said.
   ``What scares me most is dying before you get anything done. I'm
starting out with things that have some kind of longevity, that will
hopefully be around. It's something that outlasts you. It does give
you a little bit of immortality.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Candy Cane Batons and Mozart</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At Little Orchestra Society concerts, the
conductor wears a costume and gives candy cane batons to members of
the audience so they can conduct as well.
   The 60-member society, which celebrated its 40th anniversary last
May, launched its 41st season of children's concerts this month.
Music director Dino Anagnost calls it music for a visual generation.
   The imaginative conductor acts as kind of an uncle, often
dressing up according to the theme he has chosen for a concert,
mixing fun with musical education.
   ``I like kids,'' he says. ``I think they're open to anything. I'm
not trying to get them to become performers. The point is to get
them to become an audience.''
   Happy Concerts for Young People, aimed at 6- to 12-year-olds, are
held at the 2,700-seat Avery Fisher Hall on Saturday afternoons.
Lolli-Pops concerts, for folks 3 to 5, are held at the 300-seat
Florence Gould Hall of the French Institute on Saturdays and Sundays.
   The Lolli-Pops probably would sell out an even larger hall, but
Anagnost wants the tots to be physically close to the orchestra.
   Anagnost, who has led the Little Orchestra Society for 10 years,
said the programs are conceived musically and then visuals are added.
   ``We did the New York premiere of `A Zoo Called Earth' by Peter
Schickele, better known as P.D.Q. Bach. It's a wonderful score that
he wrote for the St. Louis Zoo. We used huge puppets. I think they
used real animals,'' he said.
   ``It's a story about a space man who comes to Earth every few
thousand years. The creator of the Hudson Vagabond Puppets picked
the piece. The puppets did a wonderful job of moving to the music.''
   This season, the opera ``Babar the Elephant,'' which the society
commissioned from Nicholas Berezowsky, will be presented in April.
   Each concert has a theme, such as families of instruments in the
orchestra and showing how the orchestra is used in other art forms,
such as dance, mime or an artist who draws to music. One concert had
Big Apple Circus clowns cavorting to music written for the circus by
well-known Russian composers.
   Retired tennis champion Billie Jean King was guest on a program
about sports, in which baseball terms such as base, pitch and
players were applied to part of Beethoven's ``Ninth Symphony.'' Then
King and Anagnost _ who used a tennis racket instead of a baton to
conduct _ hit tennis balls back and forth during music titled
``Match Point.''
   Last year, the group did a program on young Mozart, which
Anagnost conducted.
   ``A `young Mozart' came out in accurate dress,'' the conductor
recalled. ``He sat down on stage with manuscript paper and a big
quill pen. By the time we'd finish playing a movement, he'd have
another variation `written.'
   ``We had the `Queen of the Night' aria. People said I'd lose the
kids during that. A little theatricality came into my head. Soprano
Ramona Dorsey kept making wrong entrances, interrupting my speeches.
She'd ask if she could sing. Our Mozart would say, `No, I haven't
written you yet.'
   ``When she made her entrance at the end, the kids listened to
every note she sang and screamed bravo at the end.
   ``It was educational and entertaining,'' he said. ``They saw a
10-year-old Mozart, knew he was a little boy and wrote music. They
listened to his music from a symphony, an opera, an overture, a
theme and variations and heard why and how he wrote them.''
   The Little Orchestra Society tries to get children, who are
accustomed to mindlessly watching television, to use their ears.
   That's the reason Anagnost started the Lolli-Pops series four
years ago, to start teaching children at an early age to use their
ears and to enjoy live performances.
   ``I select the music _ quality musical selections,'' he said.
``We design the programs to make it educational, interesting and
entertaining. And we try to involve the children as much as possible
in an active way. Sometimes we give out toy trumpets and they play
along or I give them candy cane batons and they conduct with me.''
   Pieces of music need to be short or excerpts, Anagnost says,
because of the short attention spans of youngsters.
   Some of the audience is what Anagnost calls ``underserved
chidren,'' who can't afford tickets but whose attendance at final
dress rehearsals is underwritten by a foundation and administered by
the Junior League. ``I'd like to have them see an actual
rehearsal,'' he said, ``and see how we put it all together.''
   The Little Orchestra Society also presents six staged
performances of ``Amahl and the Night Visitors'' _ staged by
composer Gian Carlo Menotti _ in December at Alice Tully Hall. And
it gives Christmas and Easter concerts at Holy Trinity Greek
Orthodox Cathedral.
   The society has a record coming out next spring on the Arabesque
label. It will include ``Peter and the Wolf,'' narrated by Maurice
Sendak, who will draw the album's cover art; ``Gerald McBoing
Boing''; and ``A Zoo Called Earth,'' narrated by Anagnost.

   Tracing the Jackson's history can be as simple as
turning on the radio. There's two decades worth of music: ``I Want
You Back'' to ``Dancing Machine'' to ``Lovely One'' to the new
``Nothin' (That Compares 2 U).''
   And don't forget a few addresses _ like 2300 Jackson Street in
Gary, Ind., where the family grew up; 253 West 125th Street, the
location of New York's Apollo Theater; or 2648 West Grand Boulevard
in Detroit, once the home of Motown Records.
   Five talented, ambitious kids _ Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon
and Michael _a demanding father and the great Motown label helped
lift the family from near poverty in the steel belt to swimming
pools and luxury homes in California.
   They take nothing for granted, spending months in the studio to
perfect their records and carefully avoiding uncomfortable topics in
interviews: legal battles, family squabbles, sister LaToya's recent
Playboy photos.
   Jackie, Tito, Jermaine and younger brother Randy Jackson _ the
group's current lineup _ are looking back now. They call ``2300
Jackson Street,'' their first album since 1984's ``Victory,'' a
tribute to 25 years in sho300 Jackson Street,'' written by
the four brothers plus Gene Griffin and Aaron Hall. Siblings
Michael, Janet, Marlon and Rebbie make guest appearances, as do 16
nieces and nephews.
   ``We were recording another song and Teddy (co-producer Riley)
was sitting at the piano, playing his favorite Jackson songs,'' Tito
said. ``One of the songs was `That's What You Get for Being Polite,'
and we just started singing behind him, `2300 Jackson Street.'
   ``All the kids were there. We had to bring balloons, and cookies
and everything. There's some little bitty ones that were running all
over the place, hitting the microphones.''
   The original 2300 Jackson Street is where Joe and Katherine
Jackson raised nine children: Maureen (Rebbie), Sigmund Esco
(Jackie), Toriano Adaryl (Tito), Jermaine, LaToya, Marlon, Michael,
Randy and Janet. The boys slept in one bedroom, the girls in another.
   ``We sang from bunk beds,'' Jackie recalled. ``Tito and Jermaine
at the top, Michael and Marlon in the middle, and me and Randy at
the bottom. We'd sing in harmony and just fall asleep.''
   Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon and, finally, Michael were soon
singing together, pushed along by their strict father. Billed early
on as Ripples and Waves Plus Michael, they were renamed soon after a
neigborhood woman heard them practice and called out, ``Listen to
the Jackson Five.''
   In 1967, the Jackson 5 appeared on Amateur Night at the Apollo
Theater in Harlem, the starting point for James Brown, Dinah
Washington, Ella Fitzgerald, Jackie Wilson and many others. The
Jacksons earned a standing ovation from one of the world's toughest
audiences.
   ``New York City was always exciting to come to,'' Tito said. ``In
Gary, there were no tall buildings and the people seemed quite
different. In New York, there were taxis and theaters and
excitement. In the Apollo, if they liked you, they let you know, and
if they didn't, they let you know.''
   Discovered by singer Gladys Knight, the Jackson 5 headed for the
modest house on West Grand Boulevard. They auditioned for Motown,
the most successful black-owned record company in history, the label
of Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, Smokey Robinson, the Supremes.
   ``We all come from the same classrooms,'' Tito said. ``We were
taught by the Temptations, Berry Gordy and (writing team)
Holland-Dozier-Holland. I remember seeing Diana Ross and the
Temptations on TV and thinking we were them. When our TV broke down,
we'd just listen to the records.''
   Gordy, the company's founder, quickly flew the young group to the
West Coast and went to work on songs with a staff of writers called
The Corporation.
   From the piano sweep that kicked off ``I Want You Back'' to the
stunning ballad ``I'll Be There,'' the Jackson 5 were sensations,
the hippest kids on the block. Decked out in flared slacks and
flashy shirts, they ruled playgrounds and dance floors. Gordy called
their music ``Soul Bubblegum.''
   By 1971, they had four No. 1 singles, their own Saturday morning
cartoon show and a cover on Life magazine.
   But the magic soon wore off. By 1976, the Jackson 5 had slipped
from the charts and left Motown for Epic Records, hoping to change
their luck.
   Calling themselves ``The Jacksons'' (Motown had legal rights to
``Jackson 5'') and writing their own material, they bounced back
with the 1978 album ``Destiny'' and the hit singles ``Shake Your
Body (Down to the Ground),'' ``Lovely One'' and ``Heartbreak Hotel.''
   Through the '80s, the Jacksons have stayed on the charts despite
changes in personnel. Jermaine wasn't there for ``Triumph,'' but
returned on ``Victory.'' Michael and Marlon only appear on the title
song of ``2300 Jackson Street.''
   It doesn't matter, Tito insists. the Jacksons are a mobile home,
equipped with a revolving door, and family members who choose to
stray are always forgiven.

<HEAD>Books and Authors: A Dramatic Restructuring of Facts</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For some writers, ``facts'' can be more deceptive
than fiction. Just ask John Gregory Dunne, author of the
best-selling novels ``True Confessions'' and ``The Red, White and
Blue.''
   His new book, ``Harp,'' is a non-fictional account of travels,
family history and health problems. But Dunne admits that some
dramatic restructuring has been performed, events rearranged for the
sake of a writer's most sacred truth, a better story.
   That's why Dunne insists ``Harp'' was never really meant to be
written. It's also why he includes disclaimers throughout, invoking
an author's privilege to reinvent history.
   ``I was going to publish a book of essays with a longish
introduction, 5,000 words,'' said Dunne, whose wife, Joan Didion, is
author of ``Play It as It Lays'' and ``A Book of Common Prayer.''
   ``Last spring, I began writing this introduction and I got to
6,000 words rather quickly and kept on going. It got bigger and
bigger and longer and if I had conceived of it as a book I never
would have written it.
   ``When I got to about 100 pages, which is approximately 20-25,000
words, my wife said, `This is a book.'''
   Reluctantly, he agreed and eventually put enough material into
his computer to fill 234 pages. That may seem pretty modest for
readers, but as Dunne wrote at the book's conclusion and repeated in
a recent interview, a writer's life is his capital and 50,000 words
is a substantial expenditure.
   He also noted that material can come from anywhere. Dunne
introduces one chapter with an unusual personal ad that appeared in
the Los Angeles Times: ``TO MY Comrades in the Resistance concerning
Cheka Occupation Via Mexico. Cheka has learned of our existence.''
   Casual readers would chuckle slightly, if they could be bothered
to look at all. But items like these are buried treasure for Dunne.
   ``What does that mean, who would put that in? You really indulge
in something like that,'' he said.
   ```Dutch Shea' began with a piece in The New York Times. I got
sent several copies from various writers who said `This is your
material.' Joyce Carol Oates is an inveterate reader of the little
tiny filler items, there's a lot of material there.''
   Opinionated, confessional and investigative, Dunne's writing
incorporates the three ``p's'' that he said once provided escapes
from the Irish ghetto: politics, priesthood and the police.
   A fourth ``p'' should be kept in mind: performer. That's how he
sees himself and other writers. Reading a work by Dunne is like
having a man approach you at the bar, slam his drink on the counter
and tell his life story.
   ``I'm interested in getting the character's voice,'' the author
said. ``I was having breakfast with Joan one morning, and I came up
with the first line of a monologue. I went upstairs and I wrote it
before lunch, 13 pages for just one monologue.''
   In ``Harp,'' he challenges readers with detailed accounts of
prostitutes, family deaths and his own recent heart troubles.
   Dunne, 57, noted that other authors of his generation _ Philip
Roth, Reynolda Price _ had also recently written about their private
lives and offered his own theory why.
   ``I say we have all had life-threatening experiences. Philip just
had bypass surgery. Reynolds Price had cancer. It makes one somewhat
meditative,'' he said. Didion's multiple sclerosis is in remission.
   ``My wife insists that it's a product of good times and we never
had a war,'' Dunne said. ``Philip and I were both in the peacetime
army, and because we didn't have a war to always fall back in, there
comes a time I should write something like this.''
   Dunne was born in Hartford, Conn., the fifth of six children.
Like authors John Updike and W. Somerset Maugham, he was a stutterer
and turned to the written word as a way of mastering language.
   ``If you feel that you can't be a lawyer or a brain surgeon, I
think you begin to think about what you can do. It's interesting the
number of devices people use to get by stammering. You never stammer
if you're singing, for instance.''
   He graduated from Princeton University in 1954 and worked five
years as a staff writer for Time magazine. Dunne married Didion in
1964 and was overshadowed by her until the publication of ``True
Confessions'' 13 years later.
   A tough, bleak account of a woman's brutal murder and its
connection to two brothers, a policeman and a priest, ``True
Confessions'' sold more than 1 million copies and was eventually
made into a film starring Robert Duvall and Robert De Niro with a
screenplay by Dunne and Didion.
   Writing has now become a full-time job, Dunne said, even when
reading others. Admiration for an author's work gives way to
curiosity about the methods used to produce it. He cited Updike's
``Rabbit Is Rich,'' whose title character runs an auto dealership.
   ```Rabbit Is Rich' is an astonishing book,'' Dunne said. ``I
wonder how he found out so much about that Toyota agency. It was
sublime. You very seldom get to see in American fiction how people
work. You make them a lawyer or a writer.
   ``Writers read differently than other people, they read at rather
than read. They're interested in how it got there and how certain
effects are done.''

   Merle Haggard has the ``5:01 Blues'' blues.
   ``5:01 Blues,'' the title track of the country star's newest
album, is a catchy, uptempo number written by Jeff Tweel and Michael
Garvin. Haggard likes the song just fine, but says he recorded it
against his will.
   Tree Publishing owns the rights to ``5:01 Blues''; CBS owns Tree
Publishing. Haggard records for Epic Records; CBS owns Epic Records.
The singer insists he was pressured to do the song, that his record
company pushed it on him to get profits from the royalties.
   ``A and R (artists' representatives) people are supposed to be
the go-between for the company and the artist,'' Haggard said in a
recent interview. ``Now they're pitching songs. `It would be wise to
use a Tree song, wouldn't it?' That happened to me on that very
tune. I was pitched a variety of songs and told, in that raised
eyebrow manner, `It will be wise to have you to do this.'''
   Fighting words from the singer of ``Okie From Muskogee,'' ``The
Fightin' Side of Me'' and, most recently, the anti-flag burning ``Me
and Crippled Soldiers.'' He owes CBS one more record, but Haggard,
in a measured, threatening tone, talked of suing to get out of his
contract.
   ``You get to a certain level of popularity and it attracts this
method in the business,'' he said. ``It's kind of mean, like the old
Mafia days. `You don't have to do this, but they'll make you wish
you had.' I publicly don't like it. I'd like them to know I'm upset.
Real upset.''
   Roy Wunsch, senior vice president for CBS Records in Nashville,
Tenn., denied Haggard was pressured and said he was surprised to
hear of the singer's complaints.
   ``It certainly struck me as bizarre,'' said Wunsch. ``Our
relationship has generally been good with the artist. I was there
several months in Reading, Calif., when Merle listened to the songs
and fell in love with two or three. He certainly was never forced to
record anything.
   ``I've never known a superstar who isn't occasionally troubled by
something. Merle has had peaks and valleys career-wise and right now
he's doing well. I wouldn't know what was behind it.''
   Threats and all, Haggard likes the song's message of what to do
when the job is over and there's no one to go home to. He's also
proud of his own ``A Thousand Lies Ago,'' an after-hours weeper
about a relationship long gone bad.
   ``Songs are that way,'' he said. ``They kind of mark the period
in one's life and one's experience. You can't write about something
if you didn't know anything about it. A whole lot of life we don't
know exists if we don't cross the bridge.''
   Haggard, who's busy touring, has walked far to the other side.
Prison time, poverty, the early death of his father and years on the
road have all taken their toll. He walks gingerly, and speaks
slowly, gazing with weary eyes.
   He was born in Bakersfield, Calif., during the Great Depression,
in a makeshift home converted out of a boxcar. By 14, Haggard was
playing guitar but was also in and out of reform schools, and in the
late 1950s he was sent to San Quentin for trying to burglarize a
roadhouse.
   After being paroled in 1960, Haggard worked for his brother, an
electrical contractor, during the week and played gigs as a sideman
on the weekends. He met up with Fuzzy Owens, a local music
entrepreneur who owned a small label, Tally Records. Haggard's
breakthrough came in 1963 with ``All My Friends Are Going to be
Strangers,'' a Top 10 country hit.
   In 1966, he had his first No. 1 song with ``Swinging Doors'' and
three years later received 10 nominations for Academy of Country and
Western Music awards. The Academy named him best male vocalist in
1966, 1969, 1971 and 1972.
   Along with a steady repertoire of drinking songs and rebel
anthems, Haggard tells of fragile lives, men and women dependent on
luck and the next paycheck. ``If We Make It Through December'' is a
Christmas song without cheer, an unemployed factory worker's lament
that he can't afford a present for his daughter.
   ``The Way I Am,'' a lovely, aching ballad written by Sonny
Throckmorton, is the flip side to Bruce Springsteen's ``Thunder
Road'' and its vow of pulling out of a town full of losers. The
promise of escaping to better times is gone, never even existed.
Work, family and community are just facts of life, the singer's only
choice.
   ``Once in a while a song comes along where you say, `That's the
way I feel,' or `That's a song I wished I had written.' Throckmorton
wrote some great, great songs and I happened to be lucky and get one.
   ``It's like a lot of people, they do what they have to do,''
Haggard continued. ``They do it because of obligations; their hand
is not always willing, sometimes their back gets tired.''
   Record companies, burning flags and out-of-work veterans anger
Haggard. Other images and voices move him, make him reach for the
pen and pick up the guitar.
   ``I was listening to (announcer) Paul Harvey on the radio,'' he
recalled. ``He was talking about this newsperson down somewhere in
Arizona, walking through the cardboard houses the homeless had
thrown up.
   ``He saw this little threesome, standing underneath the eave of a
building. It was raining and he saw an older gentleman, an older
lady and a young girl. It seemed to be a family, so he walked up to
the girl and started to introduce himself and ask who they were.
   ``He asked, `What's it like to be homeless in America?' And she
said, `We're not homeless, we have a wonderful home, we just don't
have a house to put it in.'''

   Jack and Ann O'Connell feel much more secure
in their home, and Janice Collins can afford a car while she saves
for a home of her own because she shares the O'Connells' big,
comfortable house.
   ``It's not a hardship, it's a convenience,'' said O'Connell, 77.
``You can leave your cats and go on a trip and Jan will take care of
them.
   ``Besides, in this neighborhood, if you leave a house empty it'll
be really empty when you come back.''
   It's an irony of modern life that people who spent decades paying
for a house are finding it's too much to handle after the kids are
gone. Others spend huge chunks of their incomes for a nice place, or
pay less and live in a dump.
   Community groups around the country have an answer: shared
housing programs involving individuals or groups. There were 50
programs in the United States in 1981; now there are more than 400
in 42 states, according to the Shared Housing Resource Center, an
8-year-old Philadelphia-based umbrella organization.
   It's an idea whose time has gone and come back. Americans rented
rooms through the beginning of this century, before housing
programs, zoning laws and the postwar building boom brought a
decline in the practice.
   The first ``match-up'' program for individuals in the United
States was Project Homeshare, started in 1953 in Hartford, Conn. The
oldest American group shared residence is Share-a-Home, founded in
1969 in Winter Park, Fla.
   Anyone can hang a ``Room for Rent'' sign in the window, but
people who use a match-up program want it to screen applicants and
keep tabs on the situation.
   ``I would be afraid to advertise in the newspapers because I
wouldn't know what I was getting,'' a 74-year-old widow told
consultant Carol S. Schreter of Baltimore.
   ``Working with the public 40 years you learn to size people up,''
said a 57-year-old disabled homeowner. ``But I wouldn't interview
strangers in my home.''
   Ms. Collins, 40, a business student at La Salle University,
priced apartments in the Germantown neighborhood at $400-$500 a
month before she was matched with the O'Connells. She pays $175 a
month for their third floor.
   ``I have a very tight budget, but I'm saving for my own home. I
couldn't do that and afford my car if I had to pay that kind of
rent.''
   Ms. Collins moved in in 1986. In 1987, she did more than feed the
cats; when Mrs. O'Connell suffered a heart attack, ``Jan drove me to
the hospital. We got there right away, and it sure was better than
waiting for an ambulance.''
   Philadelphia Match, a non-profit homesharing service, screens
tenants and landlords. ``It's not for everyone,'' said Susan Levin,
director of the group's Delaware Valley Division. The agency makes
it clear it doesn't want people who can't pay or work for their
rent. Other ineligibles are those needing extensive care, people who
require supervision or medication, non-recovered alcoholics or
substance abusers and those in need of emergency shelter.
   ``They can make a thorough investigation on both sides and ask a
whole lot of insulting questions, because they're not going to have
to live with you afterward,'' O'Connell said.
   Renters and homeowners both pay a $5 application fee and $25
matching fee. Commercial ``finders'' who locate apartments for
people often charge much more. Philadelphia Match recommends a
two-week trial before the parties negotiate and sign a lease. Rent
can be cash or a combination of cash and services.
   Even less traditional are group households where an average of
eight people share a home owned by a community organization.
   Philadelphia Match opened St. George's Manor on April 17. The
103-year-old remodeled church rectory offers six bedrooms and a
shared kitchen, living room and bathroom space. Residents must be at
least 62 years old or disabled and have an annual income under
$12,800.
   Government-subsidized rent is 30 percent of each resident's
income. The Shared Housing Resource Center estimates the average
cost per unit in a group residence is $6,250, a bargain compared to
other forms of housing.
   A 1984 survey found the mean age of owners was 68 and half were
paying more than 40 percent of their incomes for housing. The mean
age of renters was 50, and many were middle-class and between jobs
or at the end of a marriage.
   For homeowners, the biggest advantage was financial, closely
followed by companionship. Saving money was the attraction for
two-thirds of the renters.
   In group households, financial advantage was a relatively minor
factor. Nearly two-thirds said ``having somebody around'' in the
event of an emergency of to help with chores was what they liked
best, and 20 percent saw their main advantage as safety in numbers.
   Among the disadvantages, household management issues led the
downside for landlords and tenants. These included rules on setting
the thermostat, keeping the kitchen clean and not making noise at
odd hours.
   In group homes, personality clashes were the major disadvantage.
Complaints included arguments, too much talking, criticism, etc.
Loss of privacy was less of a problem; in fact, 45 percent reported
no loss of privacy at all.
   ``You can shut your door with non-relatives,'' said one agency
client. ``They don't need to know where you are going. They don't
get so involved in your affairs.''
   Maggie Kuhn, founder of the Grey Panthers, has been sharing her
house for years. She says it creates a ``family of choice.''
   ``I have never regretted it. Shared housing makes loneliness
obsolescent.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An elderly couple in Texas is invited to join a
$50,000 ``Social Security'' sweepstakes.
   An 81-year-old retiree in New Jersey receives an envelope from
the ``IRS'' asking her to donate money to a group opposing a new
Medicare law.
   A California couple gets a ``warrant of appearance'' to claim a
prize from the ``Department of FBI.''
   Official-looking letters from official-sounding organizations
that have no connection to the government are coming under
increasing scrutiny this year from members of Congress hoping to
crack down on legal but potentially misleading mailings.
   Direct-mail schemes involving ``look-alike'' letters and
``sound-alike'' groups range from real estate investment deals to
sale of services that already are available for free from the
government.
   The ``FBI'' letter, for example, was from the Fountains Bureau of
Invitations and invited families to visit a California resort.
   The ``IRS'' designation signified only that the letter came from
a non-profit group with a particular Internal Revenue Service
classification.
   Many look-alike mailings fall into a ``gray area'' _ they confuse
the recipient about their origin but are still legal, said Thomas W.
McClure of the Postal Inspection Service. ``Something needs to be
done to make sure the public gets a clearer interpretation of what
they're receiving.''
   The Direct Marketing Association, a trade group, tries to police
itself and deter unethical solicitations, but look-alike mailings
``have been a consistent problem over the past couple of years,''
said spokeswoman Lorna Christie.
   The House in July approved legislation that would require private
mailings bearing official-looking emblems, titles and insignia to
include prominent disclaimers of any government affiliation. Similar
legislation is pending in the Senate, with committee action likely
this fall.
   The legislation's supporters include the American Association of
Retired Persons, which says ``look-alike'' mailings often target the
elderly and prey on their concerns about the well-being of Social
Security and Medicare. Some come in envelopes similar to those
containing Social Security checks and bear typical government
messages like ``Buy and Hold U.S. Savings Bonds.''
   ``There seems to be no end to people's creativity in finding some
way to make money at other people's expense,'' said the AARP's Robin
Talbert. ``People get confused about exactly what it is they're
getting.''
   Private mailings tied in to Social Security ``are on the
increase, unfortunately, because it's a very lucrative business,''
said Social Security Administration spokesman Phil Gambino.
   Groups charge fees ranging up to $40 to help married women change
the name on their Social Security records, get Social Security
numbers for children or obtain personal earnings records. In many
cases, recipients are unaware the services are available at no cost
through SSA.
   Among the outfits that have come under criticism is the Social
Security Protection Bureau, which staged the $50,000 Social Security
sweepstakes. It charges $7 for a ``membership kit'' that includes a
form people can mail in to check their retirement contributions _ a
form available free from SSA.
   ``A person has a right to either do it themselves or have someone
else obtain the information for them,'' said Michael Kushnick, an
attorney for the company. He defended its right to sell a service
and said the mailings already include a disclaimer of government
affiliation.
   The new Social Security Commissioner, Gwendolyn King, said she is
looking for ways to cut down on misleading mailings that invoke the
name of her agency, and plans to work with Congress on the problem.
She recalled a frantic phone call years ago from her 82-year-old
grandmother, who said she had gotten notice her retirement benefits
were being cut off. The letter turned out to be from a group seeking
donations to safeguard Social Security.
   ``It was almost worded just that crassly _ `If you don't send
something you may lose your benefits,''' Mrs. King said. ``We've got
to figure out how we can shut these things down.''
   The pending legislation is designed to take a first step in that
direction without stepping on the rights of legitimate direct-mail
companies.
   The House bill sponsored by Rep. Frank McCloskey, D-Ind., would
require official-looking mailings to state: ``This product or
service has not been approved or endorsed by the federal government,
and this offer is not being made by an agency of the federal
government.''
   Envelopes for such mailings would have to include the message:
``This is not a government document.''
   In addition, solicitations that looked like bills or statements
of overdue payments would have to state: ``This is a solicitation of
donations, and not a bill, invoice, or statement of accounts due.
You are under no obligation to make any payment in response to this
mailing.''
   Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., the sponsor of a similar Senate bill,
stressed that it would not limit what mailers can print, only
require them to distinguish themselves from the government.
   ``If it looks like you are trying to make the mailing come from
the United States government, we want the mailer to say, `We are
being deceitful, but it is not your friendly U.S. government that is
being deceitful,''' he said.
   The House last year passed a somewhat tougher McCloskey bill that
also would have required mailers to serve notice if they were
selling a service that is available for free or at a lesser charge
from the federal government. That bill died in the Senate, and
McCloskey agreed to drop the services provision this time to stem
opposition.
   But he cited a recent mailing from the Federal Benefits
Assistance Corp., a private group charging $18 to help people file
for Social Security benefits, as evidence of the need ``to continue
monitoring misleading mailings and perhaps legislate further
regulations to protect the unwary recipients.''

   Linda Vahrenkamp knew her ailing father could
no longer live alone, but she lived too far away to care for him.
   And just when she needed to research nursing homes, her job as a
programmer for IBM in Boulder, Colo., required her to run a major
business meeting.
   The 42-year-old Vahrenkamp turned to her employer. Within hours,
IBM's Elder Care Referral Service provided the names, costs and
other information about adult care facilities near her father's home
in the mountains.
   ``They did the legwork. All I had to do was check these places
out when I had time. I didn't have to find them.''
   That IBM would offer such a service is testament to the needs of
the baby boomers who are rising through the business ranks. Just as
they are maturing as executives, many find their parents are more
needy. ``So many of us are going through this same kind of thing,''
said Vahrenkamp.
   Other companies also are coming to the realization that they have
a stake in their employees' family problems. A study by John Hancock
Financial Services found employees with needy parents are more
likely to be absent from work and to suffer from job-related stress
than others.
   ``If elder care is a problem now _ and it is _ we had better find
good, humane answers soon. If we don't, the future ... will turn
into a nightmare for millions of us,'' said E. James Morton,
chairman of John Hancock.
   For a long time, elder care was a ``sleeper issue'' tucked away
behind child care, said Dr. Michael Creedon of the National Council
on Aging. Creedon is a pioneer in elder-care services _ he's
credited with coining the term _ and he points to population
statistics to underscore the need.
   About 30 million people are over 65 today; that number will jump
to 50 million in the early part of the next century. An estimated
2.6 million are 85 or over now; by the year 2000, that number will
double. Studies also show that 41 percent of those responsible for
elder care also have children to handle.
   ``The baby boomers delayed childbearing, so there's a high
proportion of late childbearing,'' Creedon said. ``People in their
40s are also the most frequent group for parent care.''
   At IBM, ``30 percent of our population had some responsibility
for an elder relative,'' said spokesman Jim Smith. ``We wanted to
provide more flexibility in dealing with home and family.'
   In 1987, IBM turned to Work Family Directions of Boston. Work
Family Directions had initially helped IBM establish a network to
help the company's 223,000 nationwide employees find child care in
1984.
   The next year, Work Family Directions formed the Elder Care
Consultation and Referral Service. Alan LaRue, its director, said it
collects information through 175 community-based agencies nationwide
to provide to employees.
   For Vahrenkamp, ``the worrying never went away'' but the service
helped her arrange transportation for her father to his doctors,
talk knowledgeably about his condition and deal with Medicare and
Medicaid.
   There are other elder care organizations _ in New York City, for
example, some companies work with the city's Partnership for
Eldercare _ but Work Family Directions is one of the largest.
Besides IBM, its client list includes Colgate-Palmolive, Johnson &amp;
Johnson and Aetna Life &amp; Casualty.
   For Aetna, elder care was an outgrowth of child care as it was
for others, but it had to be handled ``much more tacitly and
quietly. Employees feel they shouldn't have to verbalize needs on
this,'' said Sherry Herchenroether, the administrator of its family
services program.
   ``They deny the fact (of needing elder care) for emotional
reasons. When they do realize it it's with a sense of urgency,'' she
said. Seminars Aetna had before introducing its program were so
popular that more had to be scheduled.
   Women have traditionally been caregivers, both for children and
for elderly parents who needed help. Today, many women work,
Herchenroether said, and part of the problem stems from the fact
that ``there isn't anybody left at home.''
   Annie Smith, an Aetna licensing and contracts supervisor in
Atlanta, moved her father-in-law in with her family four months ago
because she was unhappy with his living arrangement with another
family member.
   While her son can be company for him now, she worries about what
will happen when the boy returns to school. Her call to the
company's Elder Care Referral Service has found places where he can
go during the day.
   ``Sitting around all day sleeping and eating is not good for
anyone,'' she said. ``I've got some data and I think I can get him
into a senior citizen center for part of the day so he won't be
alone.''
   Herchenroether noted that for many of Aetna's 44,000 workers,
``the employee is one place and the relative is far away, making it
difficult for the employee to find out what she needs to know.''
   While companies won't disclose the cost of the program, both
IBM's Smith and Aetna's Herchenroether say the issue is not money,
but attracting and keeping employees by offering services they need.
   ``Providing flexibility is very important,'' Creedon said. ``But
we need a lot of education. You need understanding bosses and
awareness on the level of management that this is happening.''

   Hundreds of volunteers devoted almost 28,000 hours
last year to the area's elderly _ people much like themselves but
who needed help to stay out of institutions and keep mentally
stimulated.
   The program of classes, peer counseling, handyman help and other
services is part of Life Enrichment Services, founded in 1977 by
memers of the fledgling Oak Grove chapter of the American
Association of Retired Persons.
   ``We wanted to form new friendships for people who had lost their
social support system through retirement,'' recalled Anne Eaton, now
81 and still an active volunteer. At the time, Mrs. Eaton was 67, a
nursing home volunteer and working on her master's degree in
gerontology at Georgia State University.
   She attended the 1975 charter meeting of the Oak Grove AARP
chapter and there she talked about Elbert Cole, a Methodist minister
from Kansas City, Mo., and his innovative Shepherd's Center, which
became a model for Life Enrichment.
   With $500 in seed money from the Oak Grove chapter, Mrs. Eaton
and fellow members Robert DuBose, Mack Love and Judson Greene
started talking to various agencies in their middle class community
10 miles northeast of Atlanta about forming a Shepherd's Center
program of their own.
   As part of her thesis work, Mrs. Eaton studied the area's
demographics and learned 90 percent of the 8,000 elderly residents
regularly attended about 40 churches, which the organizers quickly
recruited as affiliates. She cataloged available services and
surveyed older church members about what they needed.
   Life Enrichment Services, once it started its first ``Adventures
in Learning'' classes at an affiliate church in early 1977, was an
immediate success, at least partly because of such thorough research.
   ``We knew where the people were and we brought the services to
them,'' she said. ``We knew what churches they went to and what
services they wanted.''
   Those services include weekly classes on subjects ranging from
investment banking to bridge, photography to aerobics. Last year,
3,000 people signed up for the four quarters of classes.
   Life Enrichment also started one of AARP's first Widowed Persons
Service, through which widows and widowers counsel the newly
widowed. The trained peer-counselors donated 7,000 hours last year
helping others survive what is often the most traumatic experience
of their lives.
   Other programs involve senior citizen volunteers who deliver
meals to elderly shut-ins for Meals on Wheels; retired handymen who
mainly help widows maintain their homes inexpensively; and retired
nurses who perform free blood pressure checks at the ``Adventures in
Learning'' classes.
   Life Enrichment also operates a telephone reassurance program to
check on people living alone and a referral service for trained
companion aides.
   Hundreds of volunteers worked 27,711 hours last year to help
provide services designed to make it possible for the elderly to
remain in their own homes, and to provide mental stimulation and
useful activities for the elderly.
   As Life Enrichment flourished, it outgrew its donated
headquarters space at Briarlake Baptist Church. The directors raised
$500,000 to build the Mack Love Senior Center, which is expected to
be completed next winter. It is named for the now-deceased founder
who served as the service's first executive director.
   Mrs. Eaton, a volunteer clerk at headquarters on Mondays, is the
only founder still active in Life Enrichment, although many of the
original program volunteers are continuing their work.
   ``We're survivors and I think Life Enrichment has a part in it
because it keeps us busy,'' she said.
   ``It gives you such a good feeling to belong to something so
worthwhile.''

   Dr. Karl Menninger worries these days that
people are so hostile toward each other and that ``there is so much
greed in the world.''
   Pointing to a large jar of pennies on his desk, the 96-year-old
psychiatrist says, ``I keep them there to remind me of the
unhealthiness of people grabbing onto material things in life. When
I think of people who have acquired great wealth, what can they do
with it? What does it prove?''
   Menninger's interests run more toward fighting injustice,
pollution and other ills of society. ``I've tried to make life
easier for people. You hold a coat when you can and you tie a man's
shoe when you can.
   ``You try to do what you can.''
   His focus has been a crusade to make life better for socially
homeless children. It manifests itself in The Villages, a program of
residential care for children without parents that he founded. The
Villages observed its 20th anniversary July 22, Menninger's birthday.
   At 96, Dr. Karl is only slightly less active than he was two or
three decades ago. He spends his days consulting, teaching,
advocating social causes and receiving visitors to Menninger, the
mental health center he founded with his father and brother in 1925.
He remains chairman of the board.
   He still speaks out against society's ``taking revenge'' on
prison inmates by mistreating them, denounces capital punishment as
unworthy of a civilized society, pushes for nursing home reform and
often lectures those who come calling because more isn't being done
to improve the lot of mankind.
   Wealth-driven physicians are a special worry. ``Our medical
profession and our society don't fit any more. I shouldn't say this,
but doctors want too much money. My father never made much money and
he had a good life.
   ``I want to see it changed back in that direction, where doctors
care more about people.'' Menninger sees a government-mandated
medical system evolving in the United States if the system doesn't
change.
   The advance of years sometimes makes him grumpy. But when he
talks about his infirmities, his determination shows. He won't go
down without a fight.
   ``I don't feel good, and that worries me. I'm used to feeling
good. But I don't feel 96. I feel better than that,'' he said. ``I'm
as forgetful as hell. I'm sometimes irritable. My hearing problem
doesn't get any better. ...
   ``I feel rusty and my damn knees won't hold me up, and that
frightens me. But I'm doing OK, I guess.''
   He's alternatingly angry and philosophical over the advance of
years.
   ``I've had a good time all my life. There's so much to do and
I've found so much interesting to do. And I've found a lot of
friends to do it with.''
   Dr. Karl derives pleasure from his weekly meetings with Menninger
students and friends, and trips to The Villages.
   He helped launch the series of residential homes for children in
Topeka, Lawrence and several communities in Indiana after a local
judge complained that he had no place to send young people without
families. It was Menninger who got $25,000 in seed money from the
Fraternal Order of Eagles after speaking to its convention, and
started what he calls his ``homes for homeless kids.''
   ``Our goal,'' he said, ``was to replace families these kids had
lost, either by death, or abandonment, or their parents just
couldn't care for them. A modernized orphan's home is what it was,
although we never called it that.''
   Menninger persuaded his friend, philanthropist W. Clement Stone
of Chicago, to buy and donate 320 acres on the northwest edge of
Topeka. The first cottage was built in what became Eagle Ridge
Village. There now are five homes here, three in Lawrence, eight in
Indiana and an affiliated program in Michigan.
   ``They have done a tremendous job in Kansas from that
beginning,'' said Villages Director Gary Duncan, despite bucking a
trend promoted by the federal government to create treatment
programs for homeless youth rather than homes.
   ``Children who come here need families. They are not patients who
need treatment,'' Duncan said. ``When children's homes emphasize
treatment, they de-emphasize caring, and caring is paramount at The
Villages.''
   That, too, is a testament to Karl Menninger and his personal
creed: ``I'd like to be remembered as a person who cared.''

   The recent publicity about long-term care insurance
policies and the stories of families devastated by the burgeoning
costs of nursing home care bring to mind fears of becoming a burden
to our loved ones.
   This scenario never has to play if we learn more about long-term
care itself and the resources available to cover the risks of ``not
having enough.'' Information, education and careful planning will
eliminate the fears usually associated with long stays in nursing
homes.
   What is long-term care? It has been described as medical,
personal or social services provided at a nursing home, a custodial
facility, at home, or at a community program for a year or longer. A
long-term care insurance policy is designed to cover most of the
expenses associated with these services, but that are not covered by
Medicare, Medicaid or Medigap policies.
   Why is there so much publicity about long-term care? There are
three major influences at work that have focused attention on the
issue.
   The first is the growing number of Americans over age 65; it is
expected that by 2020, 20 percent of our population will be
``seniors.''
   The second is a dramatic change in the definition of ``family'' _
two working parents, fewer children per family, more people without
children, more divorces, more families living in geographically
diverse locations. All of this equals fewer resources available for
extended care at home.
   Finally, Medicare accounts for less than 4 percent of extended
care benefits. Under the old and new laws, Medicare does not pay for
``custodial'' nursing home care. Yet a recent study shows that 90
percent of nursing home patients need only custodial care, usually
defined as care that meets personal needs, such as getting out of
bed, walking, eating, or bathing; professional skills or training
are not required of the caregiver. The other social health-care
program, Medicaid, is intended only for the indigent.
   So for most of us, private resources must be available for both
the patient and the patient's family so neither will end up
financially destitute.
   Before you research financing possible long-term care, three
steps should be taken. First, evaluate whether you think you will
need long-term care in the future. Your family's medical history may
give you clues _ did your forebears generally die young, have your
grandparents lived long, healthy, active lives?
   Next, answer these questions dealing with your extended family.
Are they willing to care for you at home? Would they refuse to let a
family member stay in a nursing home? Are there resources to cover
professional home health care? Is the family so displaced that there
is no possibility of home care? What kind of decisions would your
family make about long-term care if you were incapable of making
that choice? Finally, consider the possibility that all your assets
could be depleted by a stay of two years, five years, or longer.
   The average cost of a year's stay in a nursing home today is
approximately $24,000. Using an inflation rate of 5 percent, that
annual cost will be almost $40,000 in only 10 years. Knowing this
now means that some of your assets can be invested specifically for
such a purpose. If you need it for long-term care, it's there; if
you don't, it becomes a part of your estate.
   Long-term care insurance policies, then, are not the only answer,
but the efficiencies of a long-term care policy may prove to be the
best course.
   Finding the right policy is no simple matter. Products are
complicated and expensive; each seems to offer the perfect solution.
The number of companies offering these types of policies is
increasing rapidly, which means competition will continue to
increase benefits for the consumers. But it also means you must
examine the details and fine print.
   The best advice now may be to wait a while, if you can, perhaps a
year or two, while the marketplace sorts out the best policies.

   My favorite summer month to visit friends is
September. In resort towns, the crowds have gone but the water is
still warm enough to swim.
   It's the perfect time for the unforgettable barbecue at the
beach: fish bought at dockside; sweet corn in husks to share the
grill; and tomatoes to eat out-of-hand bought en route from a farm
stand.
   In September when I visit friends in suburban and country
settings, what I find is more and more of their garden space is
given over to the growing of vegetables, too, which reach their
zenith now: magenta beets, rosy turnips, purple egglants, red and
green peppers, yellow squash and white-ribbed collard greens are all
flourishing.
   Not since the Victory Gardens of World War II where I remember
growing vegetables with schoolmates in a nearby vacant lot have we
as a nation been so enthusiastic about ``growing our own.'' We've
learned ``square-foot gardening,'' ``circle gardening'' and
container gardening, all for the purpose of using our space
efficiently, whether in my two-by-two-foot plot in a Manhattan urban
garden between two highrisers or in a great big 200-foot country
backyard.
   As edible landscapes pop up all over the country and local
farmers, through the Green Farm project, bring their vegetables and
fruits to cities and towns, libraries and bookstore shelves are
becoming crowded with books that encourage taking creative
responsibility for our environment and ourselves. The friends I
visit in Congers, N.Y., to celebrate their annual September Harvest
Feast are two of the best examples I know of treating themselves and
their environment with the utmost of respect.
   Joan is a professor of nutrition at Columbia Teachers College.
Alan, who is an artist by profession, is national president of Earth
Day. Surrounding the house where they raised their family is a
vegetable garden and small orchard that has evolved as their
commitment has grown to the environment. Here they produce food that
feeds them handsomely year-round in a totally natural cycle without
pesticides.
   The lucky guests invited on this special Sunday choose the
vegetables they want to prepare and cook for each course. Pole beans
for a crips nosh to eat in the garden. Leaning into a hoe to turn up
small potatoes. Reaching for kale that is the size of a small tree
to make into the hearty Portuguese Caldo Verde soup. Armfuls of
eggplants, peppers, leeks, onions, tomatoes, zucchini and basil to
turn into a glorious ratatouille.
   Laughter and good conversation abound as we reach for pots, take
our turns at the stove, serve each course at the kitchen table until
the last delicious morsel of fruit cobbler is eaten by candlelight
in the lengthening evening.
   Here are some favorites:

<HEAD>Older Americans Recruited for 480,000 Temporary Census Jobs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Census Bureau and the National Council on
the Aging are joining forces to recruit older Americans for some of
the 480,000 temporary jobs that will be created by next year's
national head count.
   Most of the workers will be out ``calling on people, knocking on
doors and finding out why they didn't return their census forms,''
said Census Deputy Director C. Louis Kincannon. Others will have
supervisory and office jobs.
   Most jobs will run six to eight weeks, paying $5 to $8 an hour
depending on location. People with management experience will be key
recruits for the office manager jobs, which may pay more and last
longer than door-to-door positions.
   ``Older people who are retired and have additional needs may find
this an avenue that may give them a new sense of confidence and also
demonstrate to a subsequent employer that they've got it in them,''
Kincannon said.
   Older people would be ideal local census-takers because many have
``a lifetime attachment to their neighborhood, which will help
particularly in areas throught the country where you've had
undercounts, for instance in rural areas,'' said Donald L. Davis,
vice president of the NCOA.
   Most of the door-to-door jobs will be available next April and
May, while office positions could start earlier and last eight
months to a year.
   Those interested should contact state employment offices or the
nearest Census Bureau office. Recruitment for management and
administrative jobs began this month; ads and recruitment for
outdoor jobs will start in February.
   Workers will have to pass a written test of basic abilities to
work with numbers and read and follow instructions, and most will
need access to a car.
   A new law lets federal, postal and military retirees take
temporary census jobs without loss of retirement pay or benefits.
The law lets federal retirees work short-term census jobs without
loss of benefits if total employment does not exceed six months and
extend beyond Dec. 31, 1990.

<HEAD>Experimental Pacemaker Tried On Four Patients</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An experimental pacemaker that
adjusts the heart rate to meet the body's needs has been implanted
in four patients at JFK Medical Center, where the first clinical
studies of the device will be made.
   The new design may make life easier for many of the 110,000
people annually who need a pacemaker to regulate their heart beats,
said Dr. Paul Winokur, the thoracic surgeon who implanted the
matchbook-sized devices.
   Unlike conventional pacemakers set at a continuous rate, the
adaptable pacemaker monitors the nervous system to determine whether
to speed up or slow down the heart rate.
   ``We think it's the next best thing to sliced bread,'' Winokur
said. ``We think it's a great advance, but it's too early to say.''
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the metabolic
pacemaker for clinical studies on Aug. 14.
   Winokur implanted the first one in 78-year-old Floyd Cooper of
Lake Worth three days later. ``I feel great, I really do,'' Cooper
said.
   A healthy heart reacts to the body's need for blood by monitoring
the nervous system. The metabolic pacemaker tries to mimic a normal
heart by using a sensor in the heart's right ventricle to report
changing needs.
   The sensor monitors respiration, blood temperature and changes in
the heartbeat to determine how much blood the body needs.
Conventional pacemakers don't respond to demands from the body so
too much activity or stress can result in weakness or fatigue,
Winokur said.
   Clinical studies have been under way in Europe for several months
but JFK Medical Center is the only U.S. hospital to use the
pacemaker, doctors said. In coming months, a few centers around the
country will be selected to participate in the studies, said Barbara
Westrum of the St. Paul, Minn.-based Cardiac Pacemakers Inc., which
developed the pacemaker over the last 15 years.
   If clinical studies show the pacemaker is effective, it could be
widely available within 18 months, Westrum said. He estimated that
up to 30 percent of pacemaker users will be able to use the new
design. It costs about $6,000, some $500 more than conventional
pacemakers.

keep inflation in check, the government said.
   The Labor Department said Friday its Producer Price Index, which
measures costs one step short of the retail level, plunged 0.4
percent last month, matching the decline in July. The index had been
down 0.1 percent in June.

   California billionaire Marvin Davis has offered to
match the $6.75 billion buyout offer that UAL Corp. agreed to with
its pilots and managers if that deal collapsed and said he would
demand no labor concessions _ a key point for unions.
   Although he noted his ``clear competitive disadvantage,'' Davis
said Friday he too would pay $300 a share for the parent of United
Airlines. Late Thursday, UAL approved an offer in which employees
would own 75 percent of the company, British Airways PLC would own
15 percent and management 10 percent.
   The pilots' offer requires labor and wage concessions and is
opposed by the union representing United machinists. Flight
attendants are weighing the deal.

   Australia's Qintex Group has won the
bidding war for MGM-UA Communications Corp. with a successful $1.5
billion buyout offer, topping media magnate Rupert Murdoch by $100
million.
   The high buyout price Friday was attributed to MGM-UA's vast
movie library, and alluring asset at a time of strong worldwide
demand for U.S. entertainment.
   Murdoch had bid $1.4 billion Wednesday for all of MGM-UA. But
negotiations between MGM's board and Murdoch's News Corp. and its
Fox Inc. unit broke down late Thursday.

<HEAD>Survey: Debt Ratings of Latin America and Africa Continue To Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A broad range of nations gained in
creditworthiness in the past year, according to a survey of
international bankers, but the debt reputation of Latin American and
African nations continued to decline.
   The 30 nations with improved credit reputations among the bankers
over the past year included both industrial countries and
oil-producing nations, according to Institutional Investor magazine,
which conducted the survey for release today.
   Among the 15 biggest losers in credit reputation were six nations
in Latin America and six in Africa, the magazine said in a news
release. Results of the survey are contained in the magazine's
September issue.
   The winners included such smaller nations as Barbados, Oman,
Qatar and Cyprus, while the losers included China, Brazil and
Nigeria.
   The survey results showed a growing gap between the credit
ratings of richer and poor nations, the magazine said. While Asian
countries as a whole continue to move closer to becoming wealthy
nations, Latin America sinks toward Africa's numbers and Africa
continues a slide of its own, it said.
   ``Growing despondency about Third World debt among the bankers
who participate in this survey has tarnished their views of Latin
American and African countries _ and unleased what bankers
inevitably call a flight to quality, which translates into higher
ratings for many industrial nations,'' the magazine said.
   The United States remained in fourth place in creditworthiness,
behind Japan, Switzerland and West Germany.
   Uganda, Nicaragua and North Korea continued to languish at the
bottom of the list, ranked 110th, 111th and 112th, respectively.
   Every six months the magazine surveys 75 to 100 bankers to rate
the creditworthiness of 112 nations on a scale of 0 to 100.
   In the 10 years the magazine has conducted the survey the ratings
of Iraq, Argentina, Mexico, Brazil, Nigeria, Liberia and a number of
other Latin American and African nations have plunged dramatically.
   Among the winners over the decade, the biggest improvement came
from Turkey, which climbed from 89th to 44th place. Also showing
significant improvement in creditworthiness over the period were
Taiwan, Portugal, Cyprus and Spain.

   Lloyds Bank PLC Monday said it has agreed to sell

   Lloyds said the sale involves 15 offices. The U.S. business had

assets at the end of last year.
   ``The sale is consistent with our policy of concentrating our

   Pitman said the U.S. business has ``little linkage'' with Lloyds'

   Lloyds said it will continue its corporate banking and treasury
operations based in New York, and its Miami, Florida-based private
banking business.

   Hostile bidder Hoylake Investments Ltd. said Monday
it controls 2.3 percent of its target, the British conglomerate BAT
Industries PLC.
   Hoylake, an investor group led by Anglo-French financier Sir
James Goldsmith, also announced that it would keep its all-paper $21
billion offer open until 1400 GMT on Sept. 29.
   Last week, Hoylake was given more time for its bid when the
British Panel on Takeovers and Mergers said Hoylake could let its
bid for BAT lapse until it had cleared all regulatory hurdles with
U.S. insurance commissioners. Hoylake can then relaunch its offer
within 21 days, the panel ruled.
   Normally a bidder which has failed to secure a majority stake in
its target within the required 90 days would have to wait a year
before bidding again.
   BAT stock was trading lower, at the equivalent of $12.62 a share,
off 16 cents, at midday on the London Stock Exchange.
   Hoylake's offer values BAT at $13.70 a share.

   Imported cars dominate both the best and the
worst categories in the annual survey of automobile gas mileage
released today by the Environmental Protection Agency.
   Overall, automakers made little gain in gasoline mileage in the
1990 model year, although the number of cars _ mostly expensive
super-luxury imports _ that trigger the federal ``gas guzzler'' tax
dropped from 40 car types to 30.
   ``There is no significant difference in the fuel economy of the
top 10 1990 models compared to the top 10 1989 models. Likewise,
overall fleet average fuel economy of all cars and light trucks ...
is projected to be about the same,'' said the EPA in a statement.
   Fuel economy has gained renewed attention in Congress because of
concern over autos' role in causing global warming and air pollution.
   Automobile emissions, especially carbon dioxide releases, are a
direct contributor to urban smog, which has caused more than 100
metropolitan areas to fail federal air quality standards. Carbon
dioxide also is a major cause of the so-called ``greenhouse effect''
which scientists say is expected to cause a warming of the earth in
coming decades.
   According to the EPA survey, the mileage leaders were largely
foreign-made with the Japanese dominating that end of the list.
   For the fifth straight year the fuel-stingiest car was the
Japanese-made Geo Metro, sold by Chevrolet, followed by the Honda
Civic CRX, Suzuki Swift and Daihatsu Charade. The Geo Metro XFI
model had mileage of 53 mpg in the city, 58 mpg on the highway, and
55 mpg overall, the same as last year.
   No U.S.-made car made the top 10 list. The Ford Escort had the
best mileage of any domestic car with 32 mpg in the city, 42 mpg on
the highway and 36 mpg overall.
   The car with the worst mileage was the Lamborghini Countach which
got only 6 mpg in the city and 10 mpg on the highway. Rounding out
the list of 10 cars with the worst gas mileage were four models of
the Rolls Royce, the Ferrari Testarossa, BMW 750IL, Porsche 928 S4;
Audi V8, and Maserati 228.
   According to the EPA survey, all but two of the 30 car models
subject to the gas guzzler tax are luxury imports. The exception are
two Cadillac models, the Allante and the larger engine (350 cubic
inches) Brougham, which have combined city and highway mileage of 18
and 17 mpg, respectively. They had the worst gas mileage of any
domestic car.
   Several Chrysler cars that made the guzzler list last year
escaped because of mileage improvements in 1990 models. These
included the Chrysler TC by Maserati and the Chrysler New Yorker and
Dodge Dynasty, successor cars to other Chrysler models that fell
under the guzzler tax in 1989.
   European models that are subject to the tax come from Maserati,
Rolls-Royce, Porsche, Ferrari, Lamborghini, Volvo, Audi and BMW.
   The excise tax amounts to a penalty of $500 to $3,850, with the
amount increasing as gasoline mileage declines. It was enacted in
1975 to encourage people to buy more fuel-efficient cars.
   The mileage results are based on tests conducted by the
manufacturer under laboratory conditions with about 30 percent of
the tests verified by the EPA, according agency officials.
   Automakers are required to have an average fuel economy of 27.5
mpg for their fleets. Last year officials in the Reagan
administration urged Congress to eliminate the fleet requirements.
But the Bush administration, citing environmental concerns, has
urged automakers to continuing pursuing increases in the fleet
averages and efforts to rescind the standards have fallen by the
wayside.
   Legislation introduced in the Senate would call for a 40 percent
improvement in fleet-wide fuel economy by the year 2000. Such a
requirement, which has been opposed by the auto industry, would
require a fleet average of about 40 mpg by the turn of the century,
industry officials have said.

   Stock prices drifted in a narrow range today in
an atmosphere of caution after the market's recent declines.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down about 77 points
over the past two weeks, edged up .57 to 2,675.15 by 11 a.m. today
on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 496 up, 670 down and

   Volume on the Big Board came to 39.56 million shares at
midmorning.
   Analysts said traders were reluctant to make any big commitments
either way while they kept a watchful eye on the market for
high-yield ``junk'' bonds.
   The market for those securities, commonly used to finance
takeovers and buyouts, has been rocked lately by problems at Campeau
Corp., which used debt to finance a coast-to-coast U.S. retailing
empire.
   If the junk bond market suffers a lasting loss of investor
confidence, brokers say, stocks might undergo a painful reappraisal
by traders no longer interested in chasing after takeover news and
rumors.
   Analysts also cited widespread talk that stocks were due for a

   CoreStates Financial Corp. and First
Pennsylvania Corp. today announced a $730 million merger agreement
that would create a leading mid-Atlantic banking organization with
nearly $23 billion in assets.
   Announcement of the tax-free $18.75-a-share deal, approved this
morning by First Pennsylvania's board, followed a weekend during
which the battle for control of First Pennsylvania intensified.
   On Saturday, Meridian Bancorp Inc., responding to CoreStates'
offer, said it intended to increase its earlier $704 million bid to
buy First Pennsylvania.
   But today CoreStates and First Pennsylvania said in a joint
statement that their merger was approved after discussion with
Meridian.
   Meanwhile, First Pennsylvania and Marine Midland Banks Inc.,
which had agreed earlier to acquire First Pennsylvania, will
terminate their agreement, according to terms of the merger plan
with CoreStates.
   Marine Midland, a unit of Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corp. of
Hong Kong, was to have acquired First Pennsylvania next spring.
   CoreStates chairman Terrence A. Larsen said the merger would
create an unspecified number of jobs and result in no layoffs. The
deal, subject to approval by shareholders and regulators, is
targeted for completion by the end of 1990.
   ``In large part our branch systems are complementary,'' said
Larsen. ``The combination will give us the strongest possible base
for providing both retail and commercial customers in all parts of
the region with conveniently located services.''
   Under the agreement, First Pennsylvania will become an operating
subsidiary of CoreStates, retaining its name as have CoreStates'
three existing full-service banks _ Philadelphia National Bank,
Hamilton and New Jersey National.
   George A. Butler, chairman of First Pennsylvania, will become
president of CoreStates. Butler previously had been considering
retiring in early 1991 but, at Larsen's request, he has agreed to
postpone his departure until the end of that year.
   Larsen will remain chairman and chief executive officer.

   Kellogg Co. President and Chief
Operating Officer Horst W. Schroeder has resigned, citing personal
reasons, the company announced Monday.
   Kellogg Chairman and Chief Executive Officer William E. LaMothe
said he would assume responsibilities of the president's office.
   Schroeder, 48, had been with the world's largest cereal company
for 19 years and had been president and chief operating officer
since December 1988.
   LaMothe said in a news release that Schroeder resigned from the
company and as a board member for personal reasons.
   Kellogg officials refused to elaborate on the reasons for the
resignation or comment on a possible permanent successor to
Schroeder.
   Schroeder, a native of Schwerin, Germany, joined Kellogg in 1970
as financial controller of Kellogg (Deutchland) GmbH.
   In 1976 he was promoted to managing director for Germany, Austria
and Switzerland and in 1978 was given responsibility for the
Mediterranean area.
   He was promoted to president and chief executive officer of
Kellogg Salada Canada Inc. in January 1981 and appointed executive
vice president of Kellogg Co. in January 1984.
   He was named president and chief operating officer of Kellogg Co.
in December 1988 and elected to the board of directors in April 1989.
   Kellogg's latest fiscal-year earnings were $480.4 million on
revenue of $4.35 billion. General Mills Co. is the world's
second-largest cereal producer.

   ``We must seriously consider eliminating or downsizing some of
our businesses that have risk characteristics that exceed their
reward potential or that no longer provide the return our
shareholders expect,'' Ankeny said.
   He said the restructuring could cost $25 million to $40 million,
which could be booked as a loss in the third or fourth quarter.
   The company said it is likely to increase its focus on its
businesses in the Upper Midwest and Northwest United States and
place greater emphasis on its consumer and small business services.
   The bank sold all of its non-trade-related loans to developing
countries in the third quarter to remove about $200 million of
non-performing loans from its books. But the bank said Monday that
its portfolio of non-performing domestic loans is growing.
   First Bank said it expects to write off about $45 million in
domestic loans in the third quarter, giving the institution a total
of about $330 million in non-performing loans compared with $294
million a year ago and $247 million at the end of the second quarter
of 1989.
   First Bank's announcement coincided with a statement Monday from
rival Norwest Corp. that it was expanding by acquiring First
Interstate Corp. of Wisconsin, the fifth largest bank holding
company in Wisconsin.
   At the end of 1988, First Bank had $14.8 billion in assets.

<HEAD>Operating Earnings Increase 18 Percent at General Mills</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First-quarter earnings at General Mills Inc.
were only about half the year-ago level, but the food and restaurant
giant Monday posted an 18 percent gain in operating profit and 12
percent sales growth.
   For the 13 weeks ended Aug. 27, General Mills earned $114.9
million, or $1.39 a share. During the same period last year, the
company booked a profit of $218.8 million, or $2.66 a share, but the
results were skewed by a gain of $198.3 million from the sale of
specialty retailing businesses.
   That gain was partially offset by a $70 million charge for an
accounting change related to post-retirement health benefits.
   On an operating basis, the cereal maker and owner of Red Lobster
and Olive Garden restaurants made $107.2 million after tax in the
first quarter of fiscal 1990 compared with $90.5 million for the
same period a year before. Sales were up 12 percent to $1.5 billion
from $1.3 billion.
   Chairman Bruce Atwater attributed the operating gains partly to
General Mills' growing market share in breakfast cereals, where
rival Kellogg Co. of Battle Creek, Mich., has long been the dominant
force.
   Big G ready-to-eat cereals achieved a 27 percent market share
during the first quarter, up from the record 24.6 percent share of
the market recorded at the end of fiscal 1989.
   Much of the gain reflects the growth of Cheerios, which has
benefited from a health craze over oat bran and the introduction of
two new Cheerios flavors, Atwater said.
   Also in the foods division, strong sales gains were achieved by
Hamburger Helper, Bisquick, and Yoplait Light.
   Restaurants, which accounted for $46.5 million of the first
quarter operating profit, reported first-quarter gains in sales and
operating profit of 18 percent and 21 percent, respectively.
   Atwater said the emerging Olive Garden chain of Italian-style
restaurants reported a 50 percent sales gain and even faster growth
in earnings.
   The company plans to invest $600 million to open 250 new Red
Lobster and Olive Garden restaurants by the end of 1992, which
Atwater said will enable General Mills to increase restaurant sales
to about $2.6 billion, a gain of $1 billion over three years.
   General Mills also plans to spend $100 million this year to build
a cereal plant in Covington, Ga., as part of a $400 million,
three-year investment program that will increase the company's
cereal capacity by over 20 percent in the next 18 months, Atwater
said.

   Stock prices rose Monday on the back of Wall
Street's early advance but extremely thin trading focused on
selected stocks.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed at a
session high of 2,373.8, up 7.3 points, or 0.3 percent. Volume was
310.2 million shares, down sharply from 725.9 million shares on
Friday.
   Dealers said nagging concerns remained over whether Wall Street
was vulnerable to a deeper correction after sharp losses last week.
   But they added that sentiment was buoyed by the 100-share index's
ability to rebound from an early low of 2,358.3, down 8.2 points.

<HEAD>Working Oil and Gas Rigs Up By 15</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of working oil and gas rigs in the
country rose by 15 last week to total 965 and remain above year-ago
levels for the third straight week, Baker Hughes Inc. reported
Monday.
   A year ago, the count stood at 921, the company said.
   Baker Hughes' rig count is the widely watched industry index of
drilling activity. It reflects the number of rigs actively exploring
for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs actively producing
oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the rig count since 1940.
   In December 1981, at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10 per
42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in the
rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes began
compiling figures.
   Among major oil producing states, Wyoming posted the largest
increase, up six. North Dakota was up four; New Mexico gained three;
Kansas and Texas each was up two; and Colorado was up by one.
   Louisiana, Oklahoma and Michigan each declined by two, while Ohio
and Pennsylvania were off one. California was unchanged.

   It was a long battle, and vigilance is still
called for, but the car-buying public seems to have gained a
long-term advantage over carmakers.
   It might be hard to believe, especially for those people who were
buying cars back in the 1960s, when automakers dictated to buyers
and buyers had the choice of taking it or leaving it.
   Then came the big push by the Japanese and other foreigners.
American car-buyers finally had a choice, and they exercised it, but
few ever thought they would be able to dictate to the Big Three.
   Well, they have, according to the Delphi V analysis, which
indicates that as a result manufacturers will be forced to restrain
prices, improve quality and offer better service to customers.
   The Delphi V technique was developed by the Rand Corporation, a
think tank, and implemented by the University of Michigan's
Transportation Research Institute, based on confidential information
from automotive policy makers.
   It concludes that ``easy sales resulting from rapid industry
growth are history.'' Competition will be stiff. The market will be
``mature,'' meaning little growth. The level of quality and service
will be even more important.
   The report, written by David J. Andrea of the research institute,
expects car prices to remain steady for the next decade. The
U.S.-produced car that costs $14,000 in 1990 may rise to $15,000 in
1995 and $15,900 in 2000. In the same period, a $15,000 imported
vehicle might rise to $17,000.
   Dealerships will become increasingly important, Andrea says. They
will need to cultivate more professional staffs, offer better
diagnostic and repair services and more customer conveniences, and
work more closely with manufacturers.
   The average total life of passengers cars is expected to climb to
12 years by the year 2000 from 11 years in 1990, although new-car
buyers will continue to stay with their purchases for five years,
same as in 1990.
   Partly because of longer life expectancy, but also for
competitive reasons, manufacturers are expected to extend power
train warranties up to 10 years and 100,000 miles on some models. By
such means customer loyalty will be built.
   While these developments might seem startling, they represent the
evolution of ideas begun in the 1980s. And if any one thing can be
singled out as the reason, it is likely to be international
competition.
   Such competition, often viewed as a threat to the United States
economy, has helped the consumer enormously. The evidence is
especially true in the automotive market, where quality and service
had for a while deteriorated.
   Forced to improve or continue to lose market share, the Big Three
of Ford, General Motors and Chrysler strive to offer better
machinery, delivery and service. Competition demands continued
improvement or a slow death.
   That competition is likely to continue, even intensify. The
Delphi V forecast is for the Big Three to lose market share over the
decade. Their share now is around 64 percent; in 2000, they are
expected to have only 61 percent.
   What the survey says in effect is that if American and foreign
carmakers want the business they will have to do even better, not
just next year and the year after, but for the rest of the century
and beyond.

   Stock prices were mixed today in an atmosphere of
caution after the market's recent declines.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down about 77 points
over the past two weeks, rose 5.32 to 2,679.90 by 2 p.m. today on
Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 6 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 619 up, 752 down and
513 unchanged.
   Analysts said traders were reluctant to make any big commitments
either way while they kept a watchful eye on the market for
high-yield ``junk'' bonds.
   The market for those securities, commonly used to finance
takeovers and buyouts, has been rocked lately by problems at Campeau
Corp., which used debt to finance a coast-to-coast U.S. retailing
empire.
   If the junk bond market suffers a lasting loss of investor
confidence, brokers say, stocks might undergo a painful reappraisal
by traders no longer interested in chasing after takeover news and
rumors.
   Analysts also cited widespread talk that stocks were due for a
``correction,'' or short-term pullback, after their sharp rise over
the first eight months of the year.
   Gainers among the blue chips included American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph, up | at 41[; McDonald's, up { at 30\; General Electric,
up [ at 57], and Procter &amp; Gamble, up 2[ at 121[.
   Stratus Computer fell 6~ to 26| as the most active issue in the
over-the-counter market. The company said its sales and earnings for
the third quarter would fall short of expectations.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.18 to 191.77. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .82 at 378.82.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar fell against major currencies in
slow European trading Monday. Gold rose about $5 an ounce.
   Foreign exchange dealers said they were reluctant to trade
because the direction of the dollar was uncertain after sharp
fluctuations Friday, when a narrower-than-expected U.S. trade
deficit for July was announced.
   Currency markets will be reluctant to make definite moves before
they see what happens at the weekend meeting in Washington of the
Group of Seven industrialized nations and central bankers, dealers
said.
   The group is made up of the United States, Japan, West Germany,
France, Britain, Italy and Canada.
   Dealers said they expected the markets to be quiet this week with
the dollar ranging between 1.9500 West German marks and 1.9800 West
German marks.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.5695 late Monday, over 3
cents more expensive for buyers than Friday's late $1.5390.
   Other late rates for the dollar in Europe compared to Friday's
late rates: 1.9525 West German marks, down from 2.0005; 1.6850 Swiss
francs, down from 1.7260; 6.5890 French francs, down from 6.7430;
2.2180 Dutch guilders, down from 2.2490; 1,417.40 Italian lire, down
from 1,433.50; 1.1834 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1880.
   Earlier in Tokyo the dollar closed at 146.43 Japanese yen, up
0.58 yen. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 145.85 yen.
   Gold prices strengthened as the dollar declined but volume was
light.
   Gold closed in London at a bid $361.65 a troy ounce, up from
$356.25 late Friday. The closing price in Zurich was $361.00 bid, up
from $356.00.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at $360.25, up from $360.00.
   Silver traded late in London at $5.08 bid a troy ounce, up from
$5.03.

<HEAD>Ferranti Says U.S. Subsidiary May Have Fraudulently Misreported Contracts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ferranti PLC, a British defense equipment and
electronics manufacturer, on Monday confirmed that its U.S.
subsidiary may have fraudulently misreported contracts to its parent
company.
   In a letter to employees, Ferranti Chairman Sir Derek Alun-Jones
said an investigation of contract irregularities at International
Signal &amp; Control, a Lancaster, Penn.-based defense equipment
company, so far suggested that Ferranti was ``at least misled and
possibly made the victim of serious fraud.''
   A copy of the letter was obtained by the AP-Dow Jones News
Service.
   The Sunday Times reported that the company might have to write
off the equivalent of $234 million or more against non-existent
contracts for which the company had previously believed it had been
paid.
   The newspaper also reported that International Signal &amp; Control
was being investigated for allegedly selling arms illegally in the
Middle East and South Africa. Ferranti officials declined to comment
on that report.
   Alun-Jones' letter said the problems under investigation ``affect
only a few transactions and are in no way connected with other
important contracts with specified customers in the Middle East or
elsewhere.''
   Britain's defense secretary, Tom King, said Monday, ``I am very
concerned and we hope these matters can be resolved at the earliest
possible date because they are an important defense contractor.''
   Ferranti executives left for the United States on Friday for
meetings, a Ferranti spokesman said Sunday.
   The company, based in Cheadle, England, announced Friday it
called in the accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand to investigate
irregularities in its accounts.
   Trading in the company's shares was suspended last week and the
annual general meeting was postponed due to problems with the
accounts.
   The difficulties have prompted speculation that Ferranti would
become the target of a takeover.
   Ferranti merged with International Signal &amp; Control two years ago
in a $647 million deal.
   According to a report in The Sunday Times, the U.S. Justice
Department has been conducting a secret, two-year investigation into
International Signal &amp; Control over alleged illegal exports of arms
to customers in the Middle East and South Africa.
   Ferranti was warned of the questionable arms deals shortly after
the merger, unidentified British Ministry of Defense sources told
the Sunday Times.
   Among other things, Ferranti supplies fighter-jet radar systems
to British and foreign air forces. It also is involved in the
development of a new generation of mobile telephones.

   Here are the Environmental Protection Agency's
fuel economy ratings for 1990 model year cars, vans and light trucks.
   The first column gives the manufacturer and the model. A ``D''
after the name indicates the vehicle has a diesel engine. A ``G''
after the name indicates the car was subject to the gas-guzzler tax.
   The second column shows miles per gallon in city driving.
   The third column shows miles per gallon in highway driving.
   The fourth column shows the overall combined miles per gallon.
   The fifth column gives the engine displacement in cubic inches
and the number of cylinders.
   The last column indicates the type of transmission and the number
of gears. For example, ``A4'' means a four-speed automatic and
``M5'' means a five-speed manual. Transmissions may carry identical
designations yet differ in some respect not shown here.
   Apparently identical listings may show different or identical
mileage ratings. This occurs because of something not shown on this
table, such as different types of transmissions or other equipment.
   For several years EPA has reduced the results of its mileage
tests by constant percentages in an attempt to more closely
correspond to results achieved on the road. The city mileage tests
are discounted by 10 percent and the highway tests are discounted by
22 percent. The combined mileage shown in this table is calculated
from the discounted city and highway ratings on the assumption that
55 percent of the miles driven are in the city.
   Turbochargers are not shown, unless indicated in the name of the
model.
   The size classifications are EPA's own, based on interior volume,
and do not confirm with size classifications in common use in the
auto industry.
   Some manufacturers may not have completed tests in time and their
cars are not listed.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Fall on Harvest Pressure, Slack Demand</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices fell sharply
Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade, dragged down by harvest
pressure and a report the Soviet Union will import no more grain
this year.
   ``We were on the defensive all day,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a
trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   Mild, dry weather in the Midwest over the weekend gave the corn
harvest a boost and provided ideal conditions for the maturing
soybean crop.
   Forecasts call for little change in the Midwestern weather for
most of this week.
   A news report out of Moscow that the Soviets have completed their
grain buying for 1989 put pressure on the wheat market. A similar
report surfaced last week.
   ``They might just be talking their position, trying to force
prices lower, but some people believed them,'' Lespinasse said.
   At the close, wheat futures were 1{ cents to 6} cents lower with
the contract for delivery in September at $3.82 a bushel; corn was }
cent to 2{ cents lower with September at $2.34\ a bushel; oats were

   Nike Inc. Monday reported a 33 percent
quarterly profit gain on an 18 percent increase in revenue.
   The athletic shoe and apparel maker said its net income grew to
$75.85 million, or $2.01 a share, in the first quarter of the
company's financial year, which ended Aug. 31. That was up from
$56.99 million, or $1.52 a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue for the first quarter came to $602.65 million, up from
$510.69 million a year earlier.
   Higher revenue was reported in all domestic footwear categories,
with the best gains from fitness and tennis, which grew 27 percent
and 48 percent, respectively. Revenue from domestic footwear
operations overall increased 16 percent.
   Domestic apparel revenue increased 22 percent while foreign
revenue was up 23 percent.
   Orders for footwear scheduled for domestic delivery from
September through next January are 37 percent above the prior year's
levels when measured in pairs of shoes. Future orders are up 52
percent when measured in dollars, the Beaverton-based company said.
   ``Our record results for the first quarter and strong futures
orders for the next five months reflect continuing strength across
all product categories,'' Nike Chairman Philip Knight said. ``Gross
margins benefited from this broad strength and from sound inventory
management. Nike's financial position continues to be strong.''

<DATELINE>FLAT ROCK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mazda Motor Corp. on Monday began
manufacturing its 626 sedan at its plant south of Detroit, but the
factory's main product will continue to be the Ford Probe.
   Mazda officials said about 60 percent of the plant's
240,000-vehicle annual capacity will be Probes. About 25 percent
will be 626 four-door sedans and the rest MX-6 coupes.
   At times during the past year, Probes have taken up to 80 percent
of the plant's production.
   ``The long-term plan was a 60-40 split, with 60 percent Ford,''
said Mazda spokesman Jim Gill. ``We knew all along that in that 40
percent would be the sedan, we just didn't tell anybody.''
   Within the next two years, all 626 sedans sold in the United
States will be made at the Flat Rock plant. That will make room in
the company's voluntary import quota for the Miata, Mazda's
strong-selling two-seat roadster.
   The Flat Rock plant began making the MX-6 in September 1987 and
production of the Probe began the following January. The plant
employs about 3,500 people. It is the sole source for the Probe and
nearly all MX-6 coupes sold in the United States are made there.

   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. said Monday
it will offer its Reach Out America long-distance calling plan in a
half-hour version for residential customers who don't make an hour
of calls a month.
   The Reach Out Half-Hour Plan, which is to go into effect Oct. 30
pending regulatory approval, will cost $4.35 a month for 30 minutes
of weekend and night out-of-state calling. Additional minutes of
weekend and night calling will cost 12 cents each.
   Customers also would receive a 10 percent discount on evening
calls.

   Stock prices rose today, turning upward near the
close of a drifting session.
   Analysts said traders were reluctant to make any big commitments
either way while they kept a watchful eye on the market for
high-yield ``junk'' bonds.
   The market for those securities, commonly used to finance
takeovers and buyouts, has been rocked lately by problems at Campeau
Corp., which used debt to finance a coast-to-coast U.S. retailing
empire.
   If the junk bond market suffers a lasting loss of investor
confidence, brokers say, stocks might undergo a painful reappraisal
by traders no longer interested in chasing after takeover news and
rumors.
   Analysts also cited widespread talk that stocks were due for a
``correction,'' or short-term pullback, after their sharp rise over
the first eight months of the year.

<HEAD>CoreStates, First Pennsylvania Agree to $714 Million Merger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TED DUNCOMBE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CoreStates Financial Corp. and First
Pennsylvania Corp. agreed Monday to a $730 million merger that rival
Meridian Bancorp Inc. said was less than its own bid for First
Pennsylvania.
   The tax-free $18.75-a-share stock deal also ended an earlier
agreement for First Pennsylvania to be acquired next spring by
Marine Midland Banks Inc., the New York-based unit of Hongkong &amp;
Shanghai Banking Corp. of Hong Kong.
   The merger, subject to shareholder and regulatory approval, would
create a Philadelphia-based banking organization with nearly $23
billion in assets and leading positions in the mid-Atlantic region
in consumer, trust and credit card markets and in processing
financial transactions.
   The stock-for-stock deal includes all of First Pennsylvania's
nearly 39 million oustanding common shares and equivalents such as
convertible stock.
   First Pennsylvania spokesman Leslie R. Butler said Reading-based
Meridian had offered 0.93 shares of its stock for each of First
Pennsylvania's outstanding shares.
   Based on Meridian's closing price Friday of $22.375, that would
have amounted to about $20.875 a share, or about $813 million. The
actual value would have depended on the price of Meridian stock when
the deal was completed in six months, Butler said.
   Meridian spokeswoman Doris Piasecki would not confirm the terms
of the failed offer.
   ``We negotiated the transaction throughout the weekend,'' she
said. ``We were confident our higher bid would be a good bid.''
   CoreStates chairman Terrence A. Larsen said in a statement the
merger would create an unspecified number of jobs and result in no
layoffs. The deal is targeted for completion by the end of 1990.
   CoreStates said both dilution of per-share earnings in 1990 would
be limited to 6.8 percent, with a modest improvement in 1991 and a
strong rise by 1992.
   Under the plan, First Pennsylvania Bank N.A. would become an
operating subsidiary of CoreStates, retaining its name, as have
CoreStates' three existing full service banks _ Philadelphia
National, Hamilton and New Jersey National.
   Philadelphia National and First Pennsylvania banks would be
realigned to serve specific market segments in the Philadelphia
area. First Pennsylvania would serve primarily the retail and
small-business market, while Philadelphia National would focus on
wholesale commercial markets.
   Joel W. Silverstein, an analyst with The Advest Group in New
York, predicted investors would view the merger favorably.
   ``It will enhance their (the banks') market position in retail
banking and middle market commercial lending,'' he said.
   Trust operations of the merged companies would exceed $100
billion in administered assets and $70 million aggregate fees per
year, ranking CoreStates among the top 20 in the nation, Larsen said.
   CoreStates, based in Philadelphia since the founding of
Philadelphia National Bank in 1803, had total assets of $16.4
billion as of June 30. Its banking subsidiaries do commercial and
retail business through 201 domestic and foreign branches and 14
foreign representative offices.
   First Pennsylvania, the oldest commercial bank in the United
States, traces its roots to the National Bank of North America,
founded in 1782. The holding company's total assets June 30 were
$6.6 billion.
   If the merger is approved, First Pennsylvania Chairman George A.
Butler would become president of CoreStates, while Larsen would
remain chairman and chief executive officer.
   George Butler, who earlier had discussed retiring in early 1991,
agreed to postpone his retirement and remain as president until the
end of that year.
   Robert B. Palmer, vice chairman of CoreStates and president and
CEO of Philadelphia National Bank, would become president and CEO of
First Pennsylvania Bank. Frank E. Reed, president and chief
operating officer of First Pennsylvania Corp. and Bank, would be
president and CEO of Philadelphia National Bank.
   CoreStates' projections of savings and 1990 earnings dilution
were based on normal employee attrition rates in both companies and
on projected non-personnel savings, Larsen said.
   The projections included a ``very conservative'' estimate of
increases in revenues, but 80 percent of the dilution would be paid
through projected savings.

   Blue-chip issues led the stock market higher
Monday on the strength of a late flurry of buying near the close of
a sluggish session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down about 77 points
over the past two weeks, rose 12.92 to 2,687.50.
   Advancing issues slightly outnumbered declines in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 751 up, 693
down and 512 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 136.94 million
shares, down from 234.87 million Friday, when activity was increased
by the quarterly ``triple witching hour'' involving a group of
expiring stock-index options and futures.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 166.73 million shares.
   Analysts said traders were reluctant to make any big commitments
either way while they kept a watchful eye on the market for
high-yield ``junk'' bonds.
   The market for those securities, commonly used to finance
takeovers and buyouts, has been rocked lately by problems at Campeau
Corp., which used debt to finance a coast-to-coast U.S. retailing
empire.
   If the junk bond market suffers a lasting loss of investor
confidence, brokers say, stocks might undergo a difficult
reappraisal by traders no longer ready or able to chase after
takeover news and rumors.
   ``We may be witnessing the beginnings of a completely different
type of stock market from the one we've known for four or five
years,'' said Greg Smith at Prudential-Bache Securities in his
current market commentary.
   Analysts also cited widespread talk that stocks were due for a
``correction,'' or short-term pullback, after their sharp rise over
the first eight months of the year.
   Gainers among the blue chips included American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph, up ~ at 41]; McDonald's, up } at 30{; Chevron, up 1[ at
59; General Electric, up ] at 57|, and Procter &amp; Gamble, up 2{ at
121{.
   First Pennsylvania gained 1{ to 16}. The company agreed to be
acquired by CoreStates Financial for $18.75 a share in stock.
   Valero Energy, which projected lower third-quarter earnings, fell
1[ to 15~.
   Stratus Computer fell 7{ to 26 as the most active issue in the
over-the-counter market. The company said its sales and earnings for
the third quarter would fall short of expectations.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $10.62 billion, or 0.31
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks gained
.84 to 192.43.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 1.83 to 396.18, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was up 1.67 at 346.73.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
dropped .68 to 466.89. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 379.50, down .14.

<HEAD>Cocoa Futures Collapse On Failure Of Price-Support Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Cocoa futures prices fell to new life-of-contract lows Monday on
New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange following the
international cocoa cartel's failure to salvage a derailed
price-support scheme.
   On other markets, grain and soybean futures fell sharply;
livestock and meat futures were mixed; precious metals were lower;
and energy futures were mixed.
   Cocoa futures settled $54 to $67 lower with the contract for
delivery in December at $1,035 per metric ton. All contracts
established new lifetime lows.
   The price drop followed the conclusion Saturday of a fruitless
six-day meeting in London of the International Cocoa Organization,
whose approximately 40 nation-members were seeking to resolve
problems that have severely weakened the cartel's ability to support
cocoa prices.
   The ICCO, charged with stabilizing world cocoa prices by
maintaining a variable ``buffer stock'' of the commodity, has been
virtually powerless since February 1988, when the stockpile reached
its permitted 250,000-metric-ton limit.
   The organization also has been weakened by the refusal of some
the major cocoa producers to pay levies on their cocoa exports to
finance ICCO operations.
   The overall debt to the organization by its 12 producer members
now stands at $120 million. Cocoa producers say they cannot afford
the levies, due partly to the historically low price that cocoa
commands in a world market burdened by five straight years of
expanding supplies.
   Negotiators for the producer nations appeared to nearing a
unified position at the London meeting on Friday, prompting hope for
a solution to the ICCO's problems, and the meeting was extended
through Saturday. But discord ultimately prevailed, said Arthur
Stevenson, a cocoa market analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc. in New York.
   ``Some of the participants at the end didn't even bother to vote
_ they just walked out,'' he said. ``This means the International
Cocoa Organization cannot be viewed as even a psychological
price-support instrument because it is just not getting support from
its key members.''
   Further selling was prompted by indications that a proposed sale
of 500,000 metric tons of cocoa from the Ivory Coast, the world's
largest producer, to the trade house Philipp Brothers Inc. had
fallen through.
   Grain and soybean futures fell sharply on the Chicago Board of
Trade due to harvest pressure and a report the Soviet Union will
import no more grain in 1989.
   Wheat futures settled 1{ cents to 6{ cents lower with September
at $3.82\ a bushel; corn was } cent to 2\ cents lower with September
at $2.34\ a bushel; oats were 1} cents to 2\ cents lower with
September at $1.35\ a bushel; soybeans were 5 cents to 11\ cents
lower with September at $5.72\ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mixed on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange ahead of a monthly Agriculture Department report
that showed 4 percent fewer cattle on feedlots as of Sept. 1 than on
the same date a year ago.
   The number was slightly lower than expected. But the USDA also
reported lighter-than-expected marketings of cattle off of feedlots
last month and analysts said they expected cattle prices to open
slightly lower Tuesday in reaction to that report.
   Live cattle futures settled .10 cent to .43 cent lower with
October at 72.02 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to
.15 cent higher with September at 83.52 cents a pound; hogs were .02
cent to .68 cent higher with October at 41.65 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .03 cent to .20 cent lower with February at 48.20
cents a pound.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold settled $2.40 to $2.50
lower with October at $362.80 a troy ounce; silver was 2 cents to
2.2 cents lower with September at $5.063 a troy ounce.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate
crude oil settled 5 cents to 8 cents lower with October at $19.88 a
barrel; heating oil was .23 cent lower to .01 cent higher with
October at 55.72 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was unchanged to
.52 cent higher with October at 58.13 cents a gallon.

<TEXT>
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari told
telephone company workers Monday that Mexican investors will get
majority control when the government sells most of its shares in the
phone company.
   The government currently owns a 56 percent stake in Telefonos de
Mexico, known as Telmex, and will continue to regulate the industry
after the sale, Salinas said.
   Salinas told about 500 union phone workers at their annual
meeting that he has ordered the Communications and Transportation
Department to release details of phone company privatization plans
within a week.
   In June, Telmex announced two alternatives for privatization in
which the government would retain 25 percent of the company.
   A rough draft of the government's proposal for the company calls
for 75 percent private ownership in order to double the system's
capacity within five years, the independent El Financiero business
newspaper reported Monday.
   Salinas said expansion and strengthening of research and
techonology are his administration's goals for the company, which
the government has controlled for 16 years.

<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices ended mixed Monday in
fairly quiet trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   The October contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, fell 8 cents to $19.88 a barrel after
peaking at $20.07 during the session. The contract had risen 24
cents on Friday.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, the October
contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline picked up 0.52 cent to
close at 58.13 cents a gallon. Home heating oil for October delivery
declined 0.23 cent to 55.72 cents a gallon.
   Oil analysts said trading was featureless as participants began
to anticipate the coming meeting of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries on Saturday.
   ``The market is being cautious,'' said Larry Lawrence, manager of
options and technical analysis for Elders Futures Inc.
   OPEC's eight-member strategy and price-monitoring committee is
scheduled to meet in Geneva to discuss current market conditions as
well as future strategy.
   OPEC officials said after the group's meeting in June that the
September gathering might turn into a full meeting of all 13
ministers and could result in a further increase in the cartel's
production ceiling from 19.5 million barrels.
   But more recent speculation is that the committee will focus on
long-term price and production strategy and wait until later in the
year to change output levels.
   Oil prices have weakened since last spring as OPEC continues to
exceed its output ceiling, but prices have remained firmer than many
analysts predicted due to strong demand and perceptions that OPEC
was trying to rein in production.
   Nevertheless, many analysts believe the current market is
overbought and that prices could weaken more significantly if OPEC
fails to show at this weekend's meeting that it plans to act
decisively to contain overproduction.

   Cattle being fed for the slaughter market as of
Sept. 1 in the seven major beef states totaled 6.43 million head,
down 4 percent from a year ago and 6 percent below the level of two
years ago, the Agriculture Department said Monday.
   Marketings of fed cattle in August totaled 1.68 million head,
down 5 percent from a year ago and 2 percent below two years ago.
   Moreover, the placement of new cattle and calves in fattening
pens last month was reported at 1.62 million head, down 3 percent
from a year ago and 16 percent fewer than two years ago.
   The department's Economic Research Service says improved forage
conditions this summer have given producers the option of keeping
cattle on pastures instead of sending so many to feedlots.
   As of Sept. 1, feedlot inventories were smaller than a year
earlier in Arizona, California, Colorado, Kansas and Texas. Only
Iowa and Nebraska feedlots showed increases.
   State feedlot cattle inventories are listed here for the seven
states, which account for about three-fourths of the nation's beef.
The first number is the number of head, in thousands, as of Sept. 1,
and the second number is the percentage of a year earlier.

   Japanese automakers are still producing the
most fuel-efficient cars _ tiny compacts getting up to 55 miles per
gallon _ while the list of ``gas guzzlers'' is dominated by
expensive, luxurious European models, government fuel economy
figures showed Monday.
   The vehicle mileage survey, based on industry and government
tests on all 1990 model cars, trucks and vans, showed little change
over the previous year, although the number of vehicles subject to
the ``guzzler'' tax dropped from 40 to 32.
   The tax, which can add $3,850 to the price of a car, kicks in on
automobiles that get overall fuel efficiency of less than 22.5 miles
per gallon.
   Bob Larson, branch manager of the EPA testing lab in Ann Arbor,
Mich., said that, overall, the nearly 1,000 models tested averaged
24 mpg gallon in combined city-highway driving.
   They ranged from the top-rated Geo Metro XFI, a small
Japanese-made car sold by General Motors, at a combined 55 mpg,
including 58 mpg on the highway, to the two-seater Lamborghini
Countach, which managed only 6 mpg in city driving and 10 mpg on the
highway.
   The mileage results are based on tests conducted by the
manufacturer under laboratory conditions, with about 30 percent of
the tests verified by the EPA. Larson said the EPA figures have been
adjusted from original laboratory results to more closely reflect
driving conditions. The reductions were 10 percent for city driving
and 22 percent for highway driving, he said.
   Larson said that while the figures, displayed on automobile
window stickers, are adjusted to reflect driving conditions, results
still can vary because of driving habits.
   The latest statistics come amid an increased clamor in Congress
and among enivronmentalists to push automakers into hiking the fuel
efficiency of their cars and trucks not only to save petroleum, but
also to curb the release of automobile pollutants.
   In releasing the mileage figures, the Environmental Protection
Agency said the most fuel efficient cars on the list emit about
one-third of a pound of carbon dioxide per mile traveled, while the
worst ``gas guzzler'' releases about twice that.
   Carbon dioxide is a chief contributor to the so-called
``greenhouse effect,'' which many scientists predict will lead to a
significant warming of the earth if not checked.
   Each of the top 10 cars with overall mileage rating of at least
39 mpg were made outside the United States, mostly in Japan. The
stingiest U.S.-made car was the Ford Escort with an overall mileage
of 38 mpg.
   The top 10 cars for the best mileage were three versions of the
Geo Metro, two versions of the Honda Civic CRX, three versions of
the Suzuki Swift, the Daihatsu Charade and the diesel-powered
Volkswagon Jetta.
   The Lamborghini was among six tested cars that are subject to the
maximum $3,850 excise tax for poor gas mileage. The others facing
the maximum tax are the Ferrari Testarossa and four Rolls-Royce
models.
   Rounding out the 10 worst mileage cars were the BMW 750IL, the
Porsche 928 S4, the Audi V8 and the Maserati 228.
   The only domestic cars subject to the ``gas guzzler'' tax were
two Cadillac models, the Allante and the larger engine (350 cubic
inches) Brougham, which have combined city and highway mileage of 18
and 17 mpg, respectively and a $500 tax surcharge.
   Several Chrysler cars that made the guzzler list last year
escaped because of mileage improvements in 1990 models. These
included the Chrysler TC by Maserati and the Chrysler New Yorker and
Dodge Dynasty, successor cars to other Chrysler models that fell
under the guzzler tax in 1989.
   Automakers are required to have an average fuel economy of 27.5
mpg for their fleets, but that reflects laboratory results for cars
actually sold and, therefore, is higher than the average fleet
figures calculated by the EPA for use on widow stickers.

   The dollar dropped again Monday in the aftermath
of the panicky decline at the end of last week, hurt by traders'
fear of central-bank selling and the uncertain effect of an
impending meeting of finance ministers.
   Gold prices also fell following gains overseas. Republic National
Bank quoted gold at $360.70 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, vs.
$362.50 late Friday.
   Money traders said the foreign exchange market was quieter Monday
than last Friday, when wild rumors and price swings jolted traders
and wrenched down the dollar's value unexpectedly.
   Traders said that rout convinced other dollar holders to sell
their holdings Monday or at least avoid the market until the
currency's long-term outlook becomes clearer.
   ``The dollar bulls are hanging on the sidelines,'' said Michael
Guarino, vice president and chief dealer at the New York branch of
Algemene Bank Nederland NV, the largest Dutch bank.``The dollar
bears are taking over. They have the central banks in their favor.
That's going to add fuel to the fire.''
   The central banks of the United States and its principal trading
allies repeatedly have swooped into the foreign exchange markets
recently to sell large amounts of dollars in order to keep the
dollar from rising in value.
   A more expensive dollar partly reflects confidence in the U.S.
economy and the relatively high interest rates offered in this
country, which attract foreign investors. But as the dollar's value
rises, it hurts American manufacturers by making their products more
expensive overseas.
   Some traders said a meeting this weekend of finance ministers
from the so-called Group of Seven nations likely would reinforce the
group's resolve to keep the dollar at present levels or depress it
further. Others said it was impossible to speculate intelligently on
what the G-7 nations might do.
   ``At this point I dare say I wouldn't put my neck on the line. My
frame of mind is one minute to one hour,'' said Scott Horwitz,
senior foreign exchange trader at the Bank of Boston's New York
branch. ``I think we'll see the dollar trade in a range until we get
new direction from that meeting.''
   The G-7 members meeting in Washington include envoys from
Britain, Canada, France, Japan, Italy, the United States and West
Germany.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 146.43 Japanese yen, up 0.58 yen.
Later in London the dollar was quoted at 145.85 yen. By the time
trading concluded in New York the dollar fetched 145.93 yen, down
from 146.35 late Friday.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.5695 late Monday, more
expensive than the $1.5390 rate late Friday. Later in New York the
pound fetched $1.5710, more expensive than its $1.5660 rate late
Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York vs. late rates Friday: 1.9523
West German marks, down from 1.9660; 1.6840 Swiss francs, down from
1.6945; 1.1833 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1847; 6.5830 French

<HEAD>Ford Introduces 1990 Ads</HEAD>

   Ford Motor Co., the leading light-truck seller for
three consecutive years, is steering clear of comparing its models
with the competitor's trucks in its new advertising, company
officials said Monday.
   Ford and Chevrolet trucks have been battling for sales supremacy
for years and Chevrolet ran a series of ads last year comparing its
trucks with Ford's in tugs of war, load hauling and switching to
four-wheel-drive in something Chevrolet tagged the ``Ditch of Doom.''
   John Vanderzee, advertising manager for the Ford division, said
Monday the company won't trade pot shots using Chevys in its 1990
commercials.
   In one ad for 1990, a heavy chain is locked to the bumper of a
hefty Ford four-wheel drive pickup, the truck begins to pull and an
announcer talks about engine size, power and competition.
   The truck at the other end of the chain, pulling equally hard,
also is a Ford rather than a competitor, and the announcer voices
the theme ``The toughest competition we have is ourselves.''
   ``One of the fundamental principles of advertising is when you
are the marketing leader you never mention the competition,''
Vanderzee said.
   Ford research indicates potential buyers want facts, not staged
competitions, he said.
   ``The consumers really believe these so-called stunts are not
what they want,'' Vanderzee said. ``We would like to think the
competition is going to get off their kick of taking us on.''
   Chevrolet, however, is continuing its comparison ads for 1990.
   Chevrolet sold more than 1.3 million light trucks compared with
Ford's total of more than 1.2 million in 1985 but Ford has led in
succeeding years.
   In 1986, Ford sold nearly 1.4 million trucks while Chevrolet sold
more than 1.2 million; in 1987, Ford sold more than 1.4 million
versus fewer than 1.2 million for Chevrolet, and in 1988, Ford sold
more than 1.5 million trucks to more than 1.3 million for Chevrolet,
according to Ford's figures.
   Although Ford's truck ads are keeping the gloves on, the
company's car ads aren't. There are pointed comparisons to features
and prices of competitors' models in television advertisements for
Escort, Festiva and Tempo cars.
   Two new vehicle introductions will boost Ford's advertising
budget for 1990, Vanderzee said, though he wouldn't give an overall
figure or a percentage increase.
   Ford's Explorer, a replacement for the Bronco II utility truck,
and a new Escort model both are scheduled for spring introduction.
   The new car and truck advertisements will debut Oct. 5 on
television, in magazines and newspapers.

   Burroughs Wellcome Co. on
Monday announced a 20 percent reduction in the wholesale price of
AZT, the only drug approved in the United States for fighting AIDS.
   The company said, however, it couldn't guarantee that the full
savings would be passed on to consumers, who have been paying $7,000
to $8,000 per year for the drug.
   The reduction, effective immediately, reduces the price to the
wholesale distributor to $1.20 from $1.50 per capsule.
   Louis Sullivan, secretary of the Department of Health and Human
Services, said he was pleased with the company's action. He said
that the price cut, combined with recent findings that lower dosages
may be effective, will reduce the cost of AZT treatment.
   AIDS activists had been pressing Burroughs Wellcome to cut the
cost of AZT. On Thursday, five activists chained themselves to a
banister at the New York Stock Exchange to protest the drug's cost.
Three of the five, who were members of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash
Power, were described as having AIDS or AIDS-related complex.
   They unfurled a banner that read, ``SELL WELLCOME,'' referring to
Burroughs Wellcome, before they were removed by guards and turned
over to police. Burroughs Wellcome, however, is traded over the
counter and not at the New York Stock Exchange.
   Burroughs Wellcome spokesman Thack Brown said the decision to cut
the price was based on test results showing that people who have HIV
infection but no symptoms can benefit from the drug.
   ``That means more patients will be using the drugs, which
broadens the financial risk,'' he said at a news conference.
   He insisted that protests by AIDS activists did not affect
Burroughs Wellcome's decision.
   ``Actually, I can say the protests slowed things down a little
bit,'' he said. ``We had to field inquiries from the media and other
people about what we planned to do at a time when we were still
trying to decide what that would be,'' he said.
   In April, four members of AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power sealed
themselves into an office at Burroughs Wellcome. They were arrested
after authorities broke down a wall. Charges were later dropped.
   Peter Staley of New York, one of the ACTUP members who was
arrested in April, said the 20 percent reduction wasn't enough.
   ``This is a step in the right direction, but a very small step,''
he said. It's not enough. ACTUP will continue to fight to make sure
that all AIDS treatments are provided to all who need them, free of
charge, which means we will continue to pressure Burroughs Wellcome
for further price reductions.''
   Sue Dodd, executive director of the Arizona AIDS Project, a
non-profit group in Phoenix, agreed.
   She said she was ``extremely pleased'' by the price reduction,
but the drug ``needs to be affordable for everyone, not just the
chosen few.''
   Jean McGuire of the Washington, D.C.-based AIDS Action Council,
who signed a protest letter to Burroughs Welcome a few weeks ago,
said she thought the company was being responsive and acting in good
faith, ``but it remains to be seen whether it's enough.''
   At the five-capsules-a-day regimen used in recent trials among
asymptomatic HIV-infected patients, Burroughs Wellcome's price for
AZT, called Retrovir, would be $6 a day, or about $2,200 a year.
   That would represent more than a 70 percent reduction in the cost
of therapy as a result of price decreases and reduced dosage since
the drug was first marketed, the company said.
   ``When the new findings on the broader utility of Retrovir were
announced by the National Institutes of Health a month ago, we
immediately commenced an evaluation of the feasibility of lowering
the cost of Retrovir to patients,'' said T.E. Haigler Jr., president
and chief executive officer of Burroughs Wellcome Co.
   ``The company has carefully weighed a number of factors,
including our responsibilities to patients and shareholders, the
very real remaining uncertainties in the marketplace and the vital
need to fund ongoing research and development programs.''
   Only a limited number of patients met the medical criteria for
AZT use when the drug was approved in 1987, Haigler said. ``Although
the precise timing and total number of patients remain uncertain, it
now appears the number of patients on Retrovir will be growing
considerably over time.''
   ``The expected growth in patient population, coupled with recent
production economies, will reduce somewhat our financial risk and
will remove some of the uncertainties which existed when this drug
was first introduced.''
   Since the reduction is in wholesale cost, Burroughs Wellcome
cannot say how retailers will respond, Brown said.
   ``We would hope it would be passed along, but we can't control
that,'' he said. ``We're going to get out to the wholesalers and
suppliers tomorrow, making adjustments in the prices, and we hope
the retailers will take that as a sign that we're working to quickly
get the price down.''
   AZT was first shown to be effective against HIV infection in
September 1986. A trial of the drug was halted because of a
significantly lower mortality rate among patients with AIDS and
advanced AIDS-related complex who had received AZT. During the next
six months, Burroughs Wellcome made AZT available, free of charge,
to some 5,000 patients.
   AZT was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in March
1987.

<HEAD>Stanford, USC Targets Of Federal Antitrust Violation Probe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL FLEEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stanford University and the University of
Southern California are targets of a federal probe into whether
private colleges and universities are violating antitrust laws in
the setting of tuition and financial aid, officials said Monday.
   The two California universities were asked in recent days to
forward documents to the U.S. Justice Department, signaling that an
inquiry that once focused on colleges in the East and Midwest had
been broadened to include California schools.
   Federal officials said they were looking into whether private
colleges and universities had engaged in a form of price-fixing by
comparing notes with other schools before setting tuition and
determining how much financial aid a student should receive.
   Officials at other private colleges and universities failed to
immediately respond to requests for comment, and it was unknown
whether other California schools were targets of the federal probe.
   The probe comes as private colleges face increasing pressure to
justify tuition increases, which have far outpaced inflation. Among
the high-ranking officials who have complained about the increases
is White House Chief of Staff John Sununu, the father of eight,
including two in college.
   The Justice Department's antitrust division last week sent
Stanford a civil investigative demand for documents pertaining to
financial aid and tuition, said John Schwartz, the university's
legal counsel.
   University Provost James Rosse said in a statement Monday the
school was complying with the government's request, but Stanford was
innocent of any wrongdoing.
   ``Stanford has had a policy for many years that forbids exchange
of current tuition, student aid and salary information prior to the
decision-making based on that data,'' he said. ``We are confident
that the investigation will show our policy to have been effective.''
   The government has asked Stanford and other schools for written
answers to five questions on how the schools determine tuition and
scholarships. The government also asked for information on expenses
ranging from travel to salaries, along with telephone records.
   Rosse said the government's request will ``generate considerable
legal expense.''
   Christian Markey, general counsel for USC, also confirmed the
Justice Department recently asked for financial aid and tuition
documents, but declined further comment.
   Although Stanford officials denied exchanging information prior
to making tuition decisions, undergraduate tuition at Stanford and
USC for the 1989-90 academic year fall within only a few hundred
dollars of each other and are similar to tuitions at other
California colleges.
   Stanford this year is charging $13,569 and USC is charging
$13,200. This compares, for example, to $13,150 at Pepperdine
University, $13,044 at Occidental College and $12,900 at Claremont
McKenna College.
   Gina Talamona, spokeswoman for the Justice Department in
Washington, confirmed the department's antitrust division was
investigating possible antitrust violations at private colleges and
universities, but she would not discuss the matter further. The
probe apparently does not include public colleges and universities.
   ``We're not going to get into specific allegations or schools,
not even geographical areas,'' she said.
   But the inquiry, first disclosed by officials at elite Eastern
schools, apparently is focusing on at least 30 private colleges and
universities nationwide.
   Some of the schools responding to Justice Department requests for
documents include Princeton, Brown, Cornell, Wellesley, the
University of Pennsylvania, Harvard and the University of Chicago,
officials at those schools have said.

<HEAD>Senator Returning Campaign Funds Raised by Keating</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Sen. Dennis DeConcini said Monday he is
returning re-election campaign money raised by American Continental
Corp. founder Charles H. Keating Jr., who is being sued for his role
in failed Lincoln Savings and Loan.
   Federal regulators on Friday filed a $1.1 billion fraud and
racketeering civil lawsuit against Keating and a number of relatives
and associates on behalf of Lincoln, a wholly owned subsidiary of
American Continental of Phoenix.
   Defendants named in the suit included William J. Keating, brother
of Charles Keating Jr. and a director of American Continental from
February 1986 through March 1987.
   William Keating, who is an attorney, is president of the Detroit
Newspaper Agency and chairman of the board of directors of The
Associated Press.
   The civil lawsuit, filed by the federal Resolution Trust Corp.
under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, also
alleges negligence, breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract.
   The lawsuit charges fraud in the takeover of Lincoln and
subsequent mismanagement that squandered the thrift's assets,
diverted ``enormous'' sums of money to the parent company and
benefited American Continental and its executives at Lincoln's
expense.
   DeConcini, an Arizona Democrat, said he would return $48,000
raised by Keating because the government's suit ``raises the serious
possibility that money from Lincoln Savings may have been illegally
funneled into a number of political campaigns.''
   Two U.S. senators from other states said Monday they would not
return contributions. Another U.S. senator previously returned
Keating-related contributions.
   DeConcini had told reporters Friday he would repay the money if
the charges held up in court. But DeConcini spokesman Bob Maynes
said Monday the senator was in the process of issuing checks to 26
individuals.
   ``I regret that there may be any appearance of impropriety on my
part,'' DeConcini said. ``In all of my relations with the Federal
Home Loan Bank Board I was acting in good faith in seeking to
protect over 1,500 Arizona jobs.
   ``My actions were not in any way related to the contributions
raised for my campaign,'' he said.
   Maynes said the 1,500 positions were held by American Continental
employees.
   Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican who received $112,000
from Keating and associates, will return contributions only if a
court determines they were illegal, spokeswoman Victoria Clark said
Monday.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., has no intention of returning
$39,000 raised by Keating for his 1986 campaign, Cranston spokesman
Murray Flander said.
   Senate Banking Committee Chairman Donald Riegle, D-Mich., also
reported campaign contributions from executives and other employees
of Keating's company, but returned the $76,100 after it was
publicized during his 1988 re-election campaign.
   Keating, a former Cincinnati lawyer, and associates also gave
$200,000 to a now-defunct committee that paid for U.S. Sen. John
Glenn's political appearances prior to and after the Ohio Democrat's
unsuccessful 1984 presidential campaign.
   Glenn said he has ``no plans to return this or any other
political contribution.''
   Edwin Gray, then-chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board,
and other officials met in 1987 with DeConcini, McCain, Glenn and
Cranston to discuss Lincoln Savings, then under examination by the
Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco.
   Gray maintains he was asked, apparently on Keating's behalf, to
revoke a thrift regulation limiting investments.
   The senators have denied any wrongdoing, and DeConcini said
Monday he would not have participated in the meeting ``if the
information that is now known about the activities of Mr. Keating
and American Continental had been known to me.''

<HEAD>Northwest, TWA, Delta Talking About Merging Reservations Systems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Delta Air Lines may join the combined
computerized reservations system of Northwest Airlines and Trans
World Airlines, the three carriers announced Monday.
   Discussions to combine the Pars system owned jointly by Northwest
parent NWA Inc. and TWA with Delta's Datas II system are in the
preliminary stages, the airlines said. Plans call for the combined
reservations system to operate as an autonomous company with
independent management.
   The announcement was no surprise to industry analysts and travel
agents, who expected Delta to rebound from its failed bid to merge
its reservations system with industry-leader Saber, owned by
American Airlines' parent AMR Corp. Plans for that merger were
dropped after the Justice Department threatened to file an antitrust
suit.
   The federal agency said the joint operation would harm
competition in the computerized sale of airline tickets.
   Robert Decker, an analyst for Duff &amp; Phelps Inc. in Chicago, said
a merger of Pars and Delta's Data II would be less likely to draw
Justice Department opposition because Pars is much smaller than
Saber, which has 41 percent of the nationwide market of the five
systems used by airlines and travel agents.
   Pars is a distant fourth, Decker said, and Delta is interested in
joining it because the Data II system is technologically inferior.
Investing in a new system would be too costly, he said.
   ``Delta has pretty well admitted they don't want to be a
contender'' in computerized reservations, Decker said.
   Pars was started by TWA and joined by Northwest about three years
ago.
   Dan McElroy, a partner and financial officer of Travel
Professionals, a travel agency in Bloomington, said Pars is
primarily known as a ``pocket player'' in the computerized ticketing
industry. It is strong in TWA and Northwest hubs and weak where the
airlines don't have a presence, he said.
   Delta's participation in Pars could add another 2,000 to 3,000
travel agencies now carrying the Datas II system, McElroy said.
   Ivar Sigveland of Travel Professionals, which has a Pars system,
said there would be no immediate effect on consumers if the merger
is completed. But he said further consolidation in the ticketing
industry might result in higher costs for travel agents.
   ``You just don't know what the long-term effects are going to be
when you lose that competition,'' Sigveland said.
   Reservations systems make money from fees charged to airlines.
For instance, when a travel agent using a Pars system books a flight
for an American Airlines customer, American pays Pars nearly $2 a
flight ``segment,'' Decker said. A one-stop flight consists of two
segments.
   The computer systems, the primary channel for the distribution of
airline tickets, provide up-to-the-minute information about
schedules, fares, seat availability, hotels, car rentals and package
vacations.
   Despite a 1986 regulation that says airlines must not favor their
own flights in computer listings, travel agents tend to be more
loyal to the owner of the system they are using, Decker said.

<HEAD>Boeing Produces Highly Efficient Solar Cell</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists at Boeing Co. have produced a highly
efficient solar cell that could lead to improvements in the use of
the sun to generate electrical power on Earth.
   The solar cell is the most efficient ever produced, according to
government experts. In other words, it produces the most electricity
for the amount of sunshine it receives of any cell.
   Boeing's research was aimed at improving the power supply for
spacecraft, but the new cell is so efficient it may have spinoff
benefits, scientists say.
   ``We were interested in space applications,'' said Roger
Gillette, a manager in the lab where the device was devloped. ``This
appears to have spinoff benefits, but at present we have no product
objectives'' for uses on Earth.
   The new cell was designed in the Boeing High Technology Center's
materials and devices laboratory.
   Low efficiencies of solar power and high costs have limited its
use mainly to space applications or remote areas on Earth where
conventional power is unavailable or is extremely expensive.
   Boeing's solar cell, which achieved an efficiency of 37 percent
in laboratory tests, converts sunshine directly into electricity.
NASA has confirmed the 37 percent efficiency, said Boeing spokesman
David Suffia.
   The previous record was 31 percent, accomplished last year at
Sandia National Laboratory in Albuqueruqe, N.M. The Sandia cell's
efficiency was considered phenomenal by experts in the solar-energy
field.
   Efficiency is the ratio of electricity produced to the solar
energy received on the cell's surface.
   ``The Boeing work is a surprise,'' said Don Schueler, manager of
solar programs at Sandia. ``Our work last year was considered a real
benchmark, like the first running of the four-minute mile.''
   The development is ``a significant step forward,'' Schueler said.
``We didn't expect such a big step so soon.''
   But Schueler noted that efficiency is not the only important
factor when considering commercial applications for solar cells.
   ``There are many other things like cost, producibility,
performance, that are important with regard to commercial
development,'' he said.
   Solar energy plants are used primarily by power utilities in
sunny parts of the country to supplement the output of coal or
nuclear plants during peak demand. They average less than 15 percent
efficiency.
   Doubling that efficiency would cut in half the size of the solar
panels required to produce the same amount of power. That would also
reduce the amount of land needed for a plant.
   Smaller solar panels in spacecraft would reduce both weight and
costs.
   Boeing has sent some of its solar cells to Sandia, where they
will be evaluated in the New Mexico sunshine, and to NASA's Lewis
Research Center in Cleveland, where they will be flown in jets above
much of the atmosphere for testing.

<BYLINE>Dreyfus Sells Credit Card Operation to Bank of New York Unit</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dreyfus Corp., an operator of mutual funds, said
Monday it has agreed to sell its credit card operation to the
Delware unit of Bank of New York Co. Inc. for about $120 million.
   In addition, Dreyfus will receive payments of about $8 million a
year for six years for a non-compete agreement.
   The credit card operation represents the fourth-largest gold
MasterCard portfolio in the nation, Bank of New York said. It has
more than 320,000 accounts with $790 million in outstanding balances.
   The sale is subject to regulatory approval and to approval from
Dreyfus directors.
   The credit card operation consists primarily of gold MasterCards
as well as a small number of other MasterCard accounts.
   New York-based Dreyfus said it introduced its gold MasterCard in
October 1983, soon after it acquired Lincoln State Bank in East
Orange, N.J., which it renamed the Dreyfus Consumer Bank.
   The Dreyfus Bank's other businesses include home mortgages,
consumer loans and certificates of deposit.

<HEAD>Gulfstream Officials Discuss Supersonic Jet with Soviets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet aerospace designers met Monday with
Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. officials to discuss a joint venture to
develop a supersonic corporate jet that would hold 10 to 12
passengers.
   Gulfstream and officials of Sukhoi Design Bureau said they hope
to develop a prototype of the jet within three years and begin
commercial manufacture in five years. Eventually, they said, they
may develop a ``stretch'' version that would seat up to 52
passengers.
   Under the joint venture, the Soviets would pick up all costs for
the project. Gulfstream, a unit of Chrysler Corp., would provide the
technology, developed in the design of its Gulfstream IV business
jet. Production and assembly would be completed in the Soviet Union.
   The venture was first announced at the Paris Air Show in June.
   V.M. Chepkin, general designer for the Soviet engine manufacturer
A.N. Lulka Design Bureau, made available slides of Soviet engine
designs that were top secret 18 months ago.
   Gulfstream Chairman Allen E. Paulson said part of the Soviet
interest in the $50 million project may stem from a need for foreign
currency.
   ``They need hard dollars desperately and don't mind spending
rubles to get them,'' Paulson said.
