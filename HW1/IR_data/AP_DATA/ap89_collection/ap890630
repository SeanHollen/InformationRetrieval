<HEAD>Warsaw Pact Proposes Plan To Limit Arms On Western Soviet Territory</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Warsaw Pact on Thursday proposed to
include western Soviet territory as part of Central Europe in
conventional arms reduction talks, Western delegates said.
   West German officials said the proposal eases NATO concerns that
the territory would be considered a so-called rear area that could
supply a Warsaw Pact advance. The proposal would limit a buildup of
forces on the western Soviet border.
   Czech delegate Ladislav Balcar proposed that the territory from
the Atlantic to the Urals be divided into four zones involved in
reductions of troops, tactical air force, helicopters, tanks,
armored vehicles and artillery.
   NATO officials said the East accepted the Western demand for
inclusion of the Soviet Union's western military district in the
Central European zone. That Soviet district includes the Baltic,
Transcarpathian and Byelorussian areas, which had been considered
rear areas.
   The Warsaw Pact envisions the Central European zone as also
including East Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary. NATO
countries in that area would be Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands,
Luxembourg, West Germjany, France and Britain.
   However, France and Britain have not been part of that zone so
far in the Western concept.
   The North European zone would include the northern part of the
Leningrad military zone and Norway. The Southern zone would consist
of Romania, Bulgaria, the Odesssa, North Caucasian and
Transcaucasian military zones, Italy, Greece, and Turkey.
   The fourth or ``rear'' zone would include the southern part of
the Leningrad military zone, the Moscow, Volga and Urals military
zones, Spain, Portugal and Iceland.
   The complex negotiations on conventional armed forces in Europe
opened in March. The Warsaw Pact has a large edge over the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization in non-nuclear strength.
   NATO proposed in March a limit of 12,000 tanks, 10,000 artillery
pieces and 16,800 armored troop carriers for any one nation. It
wants weaponry stationed outside one's home country limited to 3,200
tanks, 1,700 artillery pieces and 6,000 armored troop carriers in
each bloc.

<HEAD>Little Grassroots Outcry Over Canada's Austerity Budget</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Friday AMs report.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SOLL SUSSMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Almost every day a small group shows up on
Parliament Hill to protest Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's austerity
budget, but they have yet to set off nationwide outcries against
belt-tightening and higher taxes.
   Mulroney's government drew up the austerity budget as a means of
controlling Canada's budget deficit, and austerity may be the tone
he is setting at least for the start of his second term.
   Mulroney led his Progressive Conservative Party to a second
consecutive majority government last fall in an election whose
overwhelming issue was approval of the free trade agreement with the
United States.
   His victory cleared the way for the pact to take effect Jan. 1 as
scheduled.
   However, his critics charge that since the trade agreement was
the key issue in the campaign the election outcome did not give
Mulroney a mandate to tackle the budget deficit at the expense of
programs that the Canadian government traditionally has supported.
   Although the Canadian public has remained largely silent, a
Gallup poll published June 15 indicated that only 30 percent of
Canadians would vote now for Mulroney, compared to 45 percent for
the opposition Liberal Party led by John Turner. It was the
Progressive Conservatives' worst showing in that opinion poll since
November 1987.
   But the prime minister has little to worry about for now.
   He is at least three years away from having to call another
election and early in his term is an ideal time to put unpopular
programs into place.
   Several factors appear to be working in Mulroney's favor to
defuse any public indignation at what once would have been
unthinkable changes in government programs such as unemployment
insurance.
   Both major opposition parties are involved in internal races of
their own, because their longtime leaders have announced they are
stepping down.
   The Liberals won't pick a new leader until June 1990, although
Turner is staying on in the interim and spearheading his party's
criticism of the budget.
   The socialist New Democratic Party, which scored 21 percent in
the June Gallup poll, will pick a new leader to replace veteran Ed
Broadbent at the outset of winter.
   Mulroney and his supporters also started immediately after the
November election to lay the groundwork for the plans to bring the
deficit under control.
   ``The alternative is to keep this mountain of debt growing and
place it on the backs of your kids and grandchildren,'' Mulroney
told Canadians.
   What brought more public furor was a leak of the budget the night
before it was to be released April 27, a violation of traditional
Canadian secrecy about the document until it is officially reported
in Parliament.
   The debate about the leak lasted weeks and, as political
columnist Carol Goar wrote in the Toronto Star, it ``kept the
nation's mind off one of the most painful and pivotal budgets in
recent history.''
   In the meantime, analysts say they have found that as little as
one fifth of the savings in the budget intended for deficit control
come from spending restraints. The rest comes from increasing taxes.
   A survey by the private Global Economics consulting firm found
that tax increases amounted to nearly 7.2 billion Canadian dollars
($6 billion) of the 9 million dollars ($7.5 billion) that could be
considered deficit control measures.
   Lloyd Axworthy, one of the most prominent Liberal members in
Parliament, said much of the impact of the prime minister's budget
has been camouflaged.
   ``There's going to be a delayed reaction,'' he maintained in an
interview. ``I don't think they're out of the woods on the budget at
all; it's like a perpetual toothache.''
   Despite the raised taxes and cut expenses, a deficit for 1989-90
remains of 30.5 billion Canadian dollars ($25.3 billion). That has
prompted Mulroney's supporters in the business community to charge
that he has not moved strongly enough to bring the deficit under
control.
   The ratio of debt to gross domestic product is about 5 percent,
double that of the United States and second only to Italy among the
leading industrial nations.

<TEXT>
   Excerpts from interview with Polish leader
Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, conducted in Polish and translated by The
Associated Press.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>On the Communist Party:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The leading role of the party, understood in a mechanical way,
already is history. Today the party, like other political forces,
seeks public confidence and support. It is looking for allies and
partners to form a parliamentary coalition. Western democratic
institutions were also born in an evolutionary way.
   Building support for the party, as shown among other things in
the recent elections, has been limited. Of course it is connected
not only with mistakes in party policy ... It also is linked to the
fact that the party as the decisive force became saddled with
responsibility for, above everything, economic misfortunes. What was
supposed to be a strength turned out to be a weakness.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>On political reform:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   In this sense, a good intention, ideologically and theoretically
justified and honestly formulated by us, in practice has not yet
borne fruit. ... We didn't manage to fully prove to society that the
party is becoming different. That is why I think that if the party
will honestly _ and I believe in this _ implement its program, then
it will have a chance to rebuild its influence in society _ of
course, never again on the basis of monopoly. We have become
convinced that monopoly is a very unhealthy thing, not only in the
economy, but also in political life. But it should be based on is a
program around which a genuine coalition may be created. It is in
the interest of all political forces, both coalition and opposition,
to overcome these difficulties. Because not overcoming them would be
a disaster not only for the party, but also for the opposition. It
would be Poland's disaster.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>On the presidency:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   I haven't gone to confession in a very long time and I can see
that you want me to confess. But I used to go, I used to go. We
expect democracy from ourselves and ... you expect from me a
one-person statement about the presidency. This must be decided
democratically, through a process of consultations, both within the
coalition and within the opposition. I am not striving for this
office in the way known and typical in the West. I'm putting myself
at the disposal of those forces which I represent politically,
whether they decide this is the optimal solution. I will also
seriously consider the stand of the opposition, understanding that
the president, especially in our conditions when we have to unite
the nation's efforts and build platforms of accord, should have at
least a minimum of support from all sides. That's why i approach
this problem with complete seriousness, with a feeling of
responsibility. After all, I am a soldier, so I have an deep-rooted
feeling of duty _ but also of honor. I will not crawl to this post.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>On the Dec. 13, 1981, imposition of martial law:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   What I regret is not that martial law was imposed but that the
situation came about in which the implementation of martial law
appeared necessary. That's why it was such a difficult and dramatic
decision, and for me personally very painful.
   It was forgotten, or some people didn't want to know, what
efforts I made before the declaration of martial law in order to
avoid it.
   I want to emphasize here that then, and in many other cases, and
especially today, I must appreciate Lech Walesa's realism.
Especially today, when I see him as a man who has developed his
political possibilities very much ... and who approaches the tasks
that his movement is facing with a great feeling of responsibility.
   Looking at it from a certain distance today, I don't want to
blame the opposition alone. We were somehow not mature ... There was
a lot of distrust on both sides. The external situation was
unfavorable ... East-West relations had deteriorated, and as you
know the situation in the East was also different then. So internal
and external conditions formed such a knot that it is difficult to
say today whether another course of events was possible.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>On Poland's future:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   (At the Communist Party's 10th Plenum, during which it was
decided to restore legal status to Solidarity) I really threw
everything onto the scale, my destiny and my dignity ... It would be
the greatest drama for me if history one day said these decisions
were wrong. That's why I wish so much that the agreement, that this
pluralism, passes the test in real life.
   It is a great opportunity. One can add that the situation has
never been this favorable for us, for improving East-West relations
with Poland as a bridge. I am not saying this out of a Polish
megalomania, but ours is a nation of nearly 40 million people in the
center of Europe, which is on one hand strongly rooted in the East
politically and economically, but on the other hand very strongly
rooted in the West, traditionally and culturally. And of course
there are millions (of people of Polish descent living outside
Poland), which is also important ... .
   We also have a very good situation in that there is perestroika
and that our Polish experiment is in a sense in the avant-garde of
these reforms. It gives us a strong position within this system and
gives us a full feeling of independence and sovereignty in solving
our problems.
   (It remains to be seen) to what extent we are successful ... in
implementing difficult economic reforms which require a degree of
public acceptance and support, because these reforms are painful ...
like every surgery that is expected to bring health. When there are
only anesthetics, after some time the illness returns even more
strongly. When it's only a bandage placed on a sore, then of course
the results are only partial, like we have had so far.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>On economic reform:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   We have been making very bold economic reforms for several years
now, and they were authentic reforms as evaluated by Western
experts. ... But the realization of the reforms is partial. The
reason is that we cannot obtain society's acceptance for their depth
and severity. I can understand that. It's hard for the people. But
this understanding is probably possible only when all main political
forces address society with this. ... These main political forces
sat at a common table, will be in a common parliament and if they
find common language for this topic, this is the chance.
   I'm a very cautious optimist. If I didn't believe that (the
reforms) might bring success, I wouldn't know what to live for.
   Unfortunately there is a historically rooted tendency in our
society to martyrdom, to some waiting for changes, maybe with
insufficient activity aimed at changing one's destiny. But at the
same time this is a nation capable of great deeds, great sacrifices
and great heroism. If we succeed in building an awareness that
heroism in time of peace is necessary today, then this nation can
achieve whatever it wants. This is a great, formidable nation.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>On the upcoming visit of President Bush:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   I understand that by expressing the will to visit ... the
president wants to show his appreciation of the reforms that are
taking place here ... both in word, which is good and very
desirable, and also in a more sensible way, especially in the
economic sense. We don't want gifts or some kind of charity. We know
that it is a matter which must be balanced ... by mutual benefits.
We also know that the great United States not only offers
possibilities in this area, but also that its voice may be decisive
in the Western community. Many of the problems mired today may move
much more quickly with friendly American support. These include the
problems of our indebtedneess, and different questions connected
with that. It seems that the president could do a lot in this sphere.

<HEAD>The Queen's English: A Word From Her Son</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Friday AMs report.</HEAD>

   The government may have given up on drilling the
Queen's English into the skulls of England's young, but the queen's
son has not.
   ``All the nonsense these academics come up with!'' Prince Charles
fumed, following a recent report that urges teachers to respect ``we
was'' and other non-standard expressions as ``objects of interest
and value.''
   ``All the people I have in my office, they can't speak English
properly, they can't write English properly. All the letters sent
from my office I have to correct myself, and that is because English
is taught so bloody badly,'' the prince said Wednesday at a seminar
launching the Foundation for Education-Business Partnerships.
   ``If we want people who write good English and write plays for
the future, there is no way they can do it with the present system.
It is a fundamental problem _ we must educate for character,'' he
said.
   Reaction Thursday was mixed as is usually the case when Charles
ventures into controversial areas. The 40-year-old prince is the
product of the uppercrust private schools that are known here as
public schools, and his use of the swearword ``bloody'' drew
particular attention.
   ``If he has to swear, he is proving that the public schools are
as bad as the state ones,'' retorted Nigel de Gruchy, general
secretary-elect of the National Association of Schoolmasters-Union
of Women Teachers.
   ``The royal prerogative seems to mean ignoring all the evidence.
More children now pass more exams than ever before. He probably
doesn't pay enough to attract the right quality of staff to write
his letters.''
   The conservative Evening Standard, under the headline ``Bloody
Bad Form,'' thought it unfair of Charles publicly to criticize his
own staff but said he was right to attack teaching standards.
   Added the left-leaning Daily Mirror, parodying London pleb-speak:
``Charlie might have bin a bit out of order, but clitches from
teachers is worse than bad spelling from secretaries, innit?''
   Doug McEvoy, deputy general secretary of the National Union of
Teachers, said the prince ``has not received the benefits of a state
education.''
   ``To motivate children, you have to make lessons exciting and
interesting, and you do not do that by teaching grammar by rote,''
McEvoy said.
   That was the line taken by the government's working party on
English teaching, chaired by Professor Brian Cox of Manchester
University.
   ``If Prince Charles read our report, and not just newspaper
reports about it, he would find there was much he agreed with,'' Cox
said.
   The group's report, released last week, concluded that
``grammatical drills and sentence parsing have come to be recognized
as being mostly mechanical and uninteresting.''
   As for constructions such as ``we was,'' ``he ain't,'' ``she come
here yesterday'' and ``they never saw nobody,'' the report urged
tolerance.
   ``There is little point in correcting the spoken language of
pupils in any general way because it is unlikely to have a
beneficial effect: against the pressures of home and peer group,
teachers can have little hope of changing how pupils speak,'' the
report said.
   ``If teachers concentrate on pupils' competence in written
standard English, pupils will gain sufficient knowledge of standard
English to be able to convert this into competence in spoken
standard English when appropriate.''
   The Daily Telegraph twitted this conclusion with the headline:
``English as she is spoke receives a good report.''
   ``Teaching unions my foot!'' snorted the prince's 80-year-old
former headmaster, Col. Stuart Townsend.
   ``The prince would make a damned good minister of education,''
Townsend said. ``The whole point is that this is England, English is
our language and everyone who lives here should be able to
communicate in English, not only in reading and writing, but in
speech.''
   The report appeared last year, but was revised following a long
wrangle over the place of grammar in the curriculum. Education
Secretary Kenneth Baker had complained that grammar was not
sufficiently stressed in the first report. He says the revised
version is acceptable.
   ``Prince Charles echoes the concern of many parents,'' Baker
said. ``That is why we are introducing a National Curriculum with
English as the core subject. We have already set out standards for
7-year-olds which focus on reading, writing, speaking, grammar,
spelling and punctuation. High standards begin in primary schools.''

<HEAD>Bush's Flag Proposal Draws Mixed Reactions in Europe</HEAD>

   National flags command far less reverence in Europe
than in the United States, and President Bush's proposal to outlaw
burning the Stars and Stripes has drawn mixed reactions.
   Flag scholars in France and Belgium think Bush's idea is a good
one, but in Britain and Ireland they are less enthusiastic.
   A West German said he understands the sentiment in the United
States, because ``patriotic feeling is very much more alive there
than in the European countries.''
   An Italian law provides prison terms of one to three years for
insulting Italian or foreign flags, but scholars say they are not
aware of other laws specifically protecting European flags.
Offenders in West Germany can be prosecuted under broader
legislation protecting cultural, religious and political symbols.
   In France, a few prosecutions have been brought when flags on
public buildings were harmed, but there is nothing to prevent
citizens burning the tricolor in the backyard, said Lucien Philippe,
a French vexillologist, as flag experts are known.
   He supports what Bush is trying to do. ``If the flag is a
national symbol that is honored in all ceremonies, I think it
follows logically that it should be protected by a law,'' Philippe
said in an interview. ``That is normal.''
   Roger Baert of the Belgian Flag Society said he thought a law was
``necessary to protect a sacred idea.''
   In England, William Crampton, director of the Flag Institute,
said Bush risked going down ``a very thorny road.'' His Irish
counterpart, Seamus O'Brogain, said Bush was ``trying to enforce an
outward show of respect for symbols of state, which I think should
be voluntary.''
   Arnold Rabbow, a West German vexillologist who has visited the
United States, said he found Americans far more respectful to the
flag than Europeans.
   He said there have been occasional attempts to prosecute
satirists for debasing the West German flag, ``but the defendants
mostly argued freedom of the arts and the courts generally saw it
the same way.''
   Old Glory has remained constant through U.S. history, except for
the number and pattern of the stars, but European flags have changed
with wars or political upheaval.
   Germany is a prime example of how a nation's banner can reflect a
turbulent history.
   It has changed four times since 1848, shifting among republican,
imperial and Nazi colors. Today both Germanies fly the black, red
and yellow tricolor, with East Germany adding a hammer, a drawing
compass and a sheaf of wheat.
   Changes of regime or state ideology often find their first
expression in alterations of the national flag.
   Iran's flag since 1979 has featured the Arabic words for ``God is
Great'' 22 times, signifying the Moslem calendar date when Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini returned to Iran after Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi
was overthrown.
   Britain's Union Jack combines the flags of Scotland, England and
pre-independence Ireland in a design that often leads to it being
displayed upside down by mistake.
   The Union Jack still figures in the flags of some former British
colonies that now belong to the Commonwealth, as well as that of
South Africa, which has left the Commonwealth. It also is prominent
in the state flag of Hawaii.
   British attitudes toward the Union Jack often border on the
cavalier. The flag shows up in clothing, shopping bags and sun hats,
and frequently appears on company logos. No rules or guidelines
govern the dimensions or mode of display.
   Crampton says he would like such a code introduced, but only on a
voluntary basis.
   He believes Europeans are more relaxed about their flags because
many countries still have royal families as objects of national
sentiment.
   O'Brogain said: ``Americans revere their flag with the same sort
of superstition that Europeans revere the monarchy.''
   In Britain, far more headlines are generated by members of
Parliament who mishandle the mace, the royal symbol in the
legislative chamber, than by the occasional flag abuser.
   Crampton thinks that may gradually change.
   ``We are becoming more nervous about the flag,'' he said. ``We
see Britain shrinking as a world power and we feel perhaps a need to
turn to our core symbols. More people want to fly it than in the
past, and flag makers report sales have boomed in recent years.''

   Ethnic tensions often spurred by
years of hatred and mistrust are rising at a time when politicians
longingly speak of a ``common European home'' linking East and West.
   The causes of the strained relations are complex often involving
land, religion, economics or political freedom and are sometimes
part of a legacy of countries carved out after World War I.
   Tens of thousands of ethnic Turks are fleeing Bulgaria. Baltic
republics demand more freedom from Moscow and Italians resent the
German-speaking minority in the mountainous north.
   In the Soviet Union, some of the most bitterly contested ethnic
unrest has hit Central Asia.
   While the disputes stem from such different causes that
comparisons are difficult, the overall picture is dramatic.
   A flow of ethnic Turkish refugees has been heading south from
Bulgaria into Turkey, and U.N. officials in Geneva say the number is
likely to hit 100,000 by July 1.
   ``Everyone is packing his bags. A huge wave of immigration is in
the offing and hundreds of thousands may come if the rules do not
change,'' said Mustafa Ahmedov, a 25-year-old teacher who recently
arrived in Turkey.
   The exodus, sparked by Bulgaria's forced assimilation program for
the approximately 1 million ethnic Turks, is bound to strain
Turkey's economy and hobble parts of Bulgaria's farm and factory
production.
   Athens and Ankara, meanwhile, remain at odds over the 120,000
Moslems in western Thrace, bordering Turkey. Officials in Ankara
insist on naming the minority ``Turkish'' and periodically express
concern the rights of the minority are being trampled.
   In the mountainous Alto Adige province of northern Italy, the
neo-fascist Italian Social Movement has been picking up support from
Italian speakers resentful of the German-speaking majority. The area
also has been hit by bombings blamed on proponents of separatism.
   In Yugoslavia, the most visible of several ethnic splits is the
struggle between Serbs and ethnic Albanians in the southern province
of Kosovo.
   More than a half-million Serbs rallied in the provincial capital
of Pristina on Wednesday to mark the 600th anniversary of the Battle
of Kosovo, increasing tensions between the two sides. The 1389
battle sparked the Serbs' centuries-long fight against Islam.
   Serbia's drive to regain more control over its province led to
rioting by ethnic Albanians in March that killed 25 people in bloody
clashes with security forces.
   Romania, under President Nicolae Ceausescu, is trying to
eradicate separate ethnic minorities, leading thousands of ethnic
Hungarians to seek asyslum.
   Still, each ethnic conflict has its own roots, often heightened
by different religions and economic imbalances.
   ``We can't just lump together the Meskhi Turks in Uzbekistan,
northern Ireland and the Germans in northern Italy,'' says Waltraud
Kokot, an ethnologist at the University of Cologne.
   ``We have to understand the conflicts as being restricted both in
cultural and historical terms,'' she said in an interview.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, during a visit to West
Germany in June, signed a joint declaration with Chancellor Helmut
Kohl that called for ``a common European home.''
   Yet, in his own home, Gorbachev must cope daily with a wide array
of tensions that could threaten his reforms.
   The restive Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania
have kept their battles for greater independence violence-free, as
they demand more local control over their relatively well-off
economies.
   After years of tension with their German minority members, Soviet
bloc countries have opened a virtual floodgate of emigration. Moscow
alone let 33,352 ethnic Germans emigrate to West Germany in the
first five months of this year, the West German interior ministry
said.
   Seeking ways to stem the flow, the Soviet Union is considering
the possible establishment of an autonomous ethnic German settlement.
   Parts of the Soviet Union have been wracked by ethnic violence.
   People have been killed and injured in riots in the Central Asian
republic of Kazakhstan.
   The June 17-20 riots were in the oil production center of Novy
Uzen between Kazakhs and settlers from the Caucasus Mountains
region. Native Kazakhs complain the settlers dominate oil industry
jobs and receive preferential treatment in housing and other
benefits.
   Earlier in June, a wave of murder and arson swept the Fergana
Valley region of Uzbekistan, another predominantly Moslem Central
Asian republic.
   Rioters there fixed on another ethnic minority: this time the
Meskhi Turks, who had been deported to the area from their homeland
in Georgia by Josef Stalin in 1944. About 100 people died in the
Fergana Valley unrest.
   Both cases of Central Asian violence came against a background of
poverty and unemployment in regions whose crops and industries have
long been dictated by Moscow.
   On Sunday, Georgians and Azerbaijanis clashed in Soviet Georgia
and five people were wounded, a news editor in the southern republic
said.
   In April, 20 people were killed in the Georgian capital of
Tbilisi when troops were called in to quell a pro-democracy
demonstration.

   Oregon doesn't have a National Football League
team, but it may soon become the only state in the nation to offer a
lottery game based on the point spreads of NFL games.
   NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle is threatening legal action, saying
such a betting game would harm the integrity of professional
football.
   Boosters of the game say it would tap a new audience for the
Oregon Lottery and could be used to raise money for college sports
programs.
   Gov. Neil Goldschmidt initially said he shared Rozelle's concerns
about the game, which for a $1 investment would allow players to
predict the outcome of some or all of the 14 weekly NFL games
against the point spread.
   This week, however, Goldschmidt said that after discussing the
game with lottery officials he's warming up to the idea.
   ``I'm not saying I would prefer to do what it is they're
proposing, but my comfort level is slightly higher than it was,''
the governor said at a news conference Tuesday.
   Goldschmidt has said he supports a bill pending in the
Legislature calling on the lottery to create a new game to generate
up to $9 million a year for Oregon intercollegiate sports. In
general, proceeds from the Oregon Lottery are used for economic
development programs, which can ben anything from a current prison
construction program to local sewer improvements.
   Oregon Lottery Director Jim Davey hopes to use the NFL betting
game for the college sports fund, although he's drawing up a list of
possible alternatives.
   New games must be approved by the five-member Lottery Commission,
which can act without the governor's approval although the members
and Davey are appointed by the governor and serve at his pleasure.
   The commission members are considering meeting in the next two
weeks and have said they support the proposal. Chairman Debbs Potts
said earlier this week that he hoped the commission would approve
the game.
   Under the lottery's proposal, players would try to predict the
outcome of four to 14 games against the point spreads set by Nevada
casino oddsmakers. The more games they bet, the more money they
could win, from about $8 for a perfect four-game card to about
$8,000 for a perfect 14-game card.
   Though Oregon's lottery is small by national standards _ $150
million in annual sales _ the football betting game proposal is
viewed by the NFL ``with genuine alarm,'' Rozelle said in a recent
letter to Goldschmidt.
   The NFL chief said linking a lottery game to the outcome of NFL
games would jeopardize the public's confidence that every player was
doing his best and that referees were calling plays as they see them.
   ``It could change the fundamental character of fan interest in
the game,'' League spokesman Jim Heffernan said in a telephone
interview from NFL headquarters in New York. ``They would not be
concerned about who won the games but by how many points a team
wins.''
   Davey said people already bet millions of dollars each year on
NFL games, whether legally in Nevada or through bookies and office
pools elsewhere.
   ``It's already happening, and all we're doing is tapping into
that market,'' the lottery director said.
   Heffernan argues, however, that there's no comparison between the
long-established legalized gambling in Nevada and proposals
elsewhere to base lotteries on NFL games.
   ``It's already on the books in Nevada,'' he said. ``The National
Football League can't repeal a law in Nevada. But certainly, with
something that's not on the books, we can voice our opinion.'
   The league might sue Oregon if the state goes ahead with a
football lottery game, Heffernan said.
   The league took the state of Delaware to court when that state
tried a football betting game. But the lawsuit became moot after
Delaware gave up its game after one season in 1974 because it lost
money.

<HEAD>Copper Mining Town Goes from Rags to Riches</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Friday AMs report.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WHITE PINE, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Horatio Alger, step aside. The copper
miners of White Pine can boast of a rags to riches story that gives
new meaning to the American Dream of lore.
   Once on the verge of economic disaster, the small town is
suddenly wealthy. Rusty Rock tipped a store clerk with a $100 bill,
minus the cost of a pack of cigarettes. Cherrie Sporleder paid her
debts and bought a car _ a 1940 Nash. Twenty-two of the town's 24
high school graduates are planning for college.
   Little of that would have been possible before May 23, when a
Canadian company paid $83 million to the approximately 1,000 workers
of the Copper Range Co. to buy their employee-owned,
employee-rescued mine.
   The checks from Metall Mining Corp. of Toronto arrived early this
month. Twenty top managers split 30 percent of the buyout. The
average blue-collar worker found $60,000 in his post office box.
Some executives got millions.
   ``On a per-capita basis, this is probably the richest community
in the state of Michigan,'' White Pine grade school teacher and
township supervisor Pete Rigoni said recently over a cup of coffee
and a plate of eggs.
   Only a few years ago, such a notion would have seemed like
chasing rainbows to White Pine's 1,000 residents.
   Copper Range was spending more than $1 to mine a pound of copper
cathode that was worth only 60 cents on the market. Employment
dropped from 3,140 in 1974 to a few hundred. The miners struck and
Echo Bay Mines Ltd. of Canada closed Copper Range in 1985.
   Echo Bay was days _ some say hours _ away from shutting off the
pumps that kept Copper Range's tunnels from flooding when the
workers, government agencies and a trio of corporate managers pulled
off the buyout.
   Four years of employee ownership and a self-imposed wage cut from
$12 an hour to $8.50 dropped the production cost to 75 cents per
pound. In the same span, copper prices have more than doubled.
Copper Range in December issued employee-owners their first
profit-sharing checks.
   By saving the mine, the workers have saved White Pine, a twisting
subdivision of lawns and split-levels that seem out of place so deep
in the North Woods. There is no downtown _ only a company-built mall
across the highway from the mine gate. A giant smokestack stands
like a totem over town and spits out things that make the morning
fog taste like electrolyte.
   If you don't mine copper in White Pine, you probably cut trees.
But lately, White Pine has been home to more than lumberjacks and
miners.
   Investment brokers from all over the Midwest have swarmed this
tiny community below the Porcupine Mountains. The Konteka hotel has
hosted 42 investment seminars and more are scheduled, an employee
said.
   ``There's $83 million up for grabs and they all want their fare
share,'' said Copper Range personnel director Larry Chabot. As of
early June, Chabot had been contacted by 39 brokers ``and that's
enough.''
   The miners bear with the out-of-towners like a dog wears fleas.
   ``We asked around if they wanted us to hold our own investment
workshop,'' said Tom Strong, president of the Citizen's State Bank
in nearby Ontonagon. ``They said, `Geez, not another seminar.'''
   Strong's bank left the seminars to the outsiders and is relying
on other ways to keep some of the miners' millions in Michigan.
   ``If you deposit here, your community grows,'' Strong said
Thursday. ``If you deposit outside the community, somebody else's
town grows.''
   Local bank deposits have swelled by as much as 30 percent, but
Strong said much of the money is in temporary accounts while miners
use a 60-day federal grace period to find the right tax shelters.
Any unsheltered money will be subject to a 30 percent tax rate.
   Mrs. Sporleder, a Copper Range security worker, bypassed the
brokers and spent some of her buyout booty to pay off all of her
bills. Then she and husband George drove to nearby Bessemer and
drove home in their shiny Nash.
   ``Just to think you don't owe anybody, it's wonderful,'' she
said. ``It makes you think we'll have a future for at least another
four years.''
   Metall has promised shareholders another $15 million if they meet
production and profit targets the next four years. Union
representatives say the goals can be reached if the price of copper
stays up.

<HEAD>General Electric, University of Utah Sign Cold Fusion Collaboration</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The University of Utah and General Electric
have reached an agreement under which four GE scientists will study
the school's purported breakthrough in ``cold'' nuclear fusion.
   The collaboration, announced Wednesday, is the first such
agreement the university has made with a major corporation, said
James Brophy, the school's vice president for research.
   ``This is the first time that any private corporation has
revealed what it's doing in cold fusion _ and General Electric,
which of course is an outstanding company, is doing it with the
University of Utah,'' Brophy said.
   The agreement is not exclusive, allowing the university to make
similar arrangements with others, and does not provide any seed
money to the school for research.
   On March 23, University of Utah chemist B. Stanley Pons and a
British colleague, Martin Fleischmann, announced they had sustained
room-temperature nuclear fusion in an experiment using rods of
palladium inside coils of platinum immersed in electrically charged,
deuterium-rich heavy water.
   Pons and Fleischmann maintain the experiment yields more than 100
times the energy needed to produce it. Researchers around the world
have duplicated portions of their experiment, but proof of nuclear
fusion has remained elusive.
   Hugo Rossi, director of the U of U's solid-state research
efforts, said three of the General Electric scientists will be based
in company's headquarters in Schenectady, N.Y.
   A fourth, a thermodynamicist, arrived in Salt Lake City on Monday
to begin working with researchers at the university's fusion
laboratories. Under terms of the agreement, Utah scientists also
will use GE's laboratories.
   Rossi said GE scientists have come to the university on a regular
basis to visit Pons' fusion laboratories.
   ``They have carefully studied and worked with Pons on all the raw
data and conversion into conclusions,'' he said. ``They don't feel
completely satisfied with all of the claims of Pons and Fleischmann;
there are some points that are going to require further research.
   ``But they are satisfied enough to feel that something genuine is
going on _ and it's worth their further investigation,'' Rossi said.

   Police applied the Denver boot, a device that clamps onto wheels
to keep a car from moving, to Mr. T's car Wednesday arfter a record
check indicated the owner owed fines on 11 parking tickets.
   It turned out the unpaid fines were owed by another ``Mr. T,''
but the former star of ``The A-Team'' wasn't angered by the mix-up.
   He went to City Hall and said, ``I know these aren't mine, but
I'll pay them anyway,'' according to mayoral spokeswoman Marj
Halperin.
   The tickets were issued to another driver who used the ``MR T''
vanity license plate before the real Mr. T did, Ms. Halperin said.
Despite Mr. T's offer, she said officials would try to find and fine
the real scofflaw.
   Mr. T, who owns a mansion in suburban Lake Forest, uses his stage
name on license plates of each of his nine cars, said his

   Queen Elizabeth II experienced again some of the
frightening sights and sounds of her youth during World War II.
   The 63-year-old monarch, whose Buckingham Palace home was bombed
in 1940, visited a new sight and sound exhibit Thursday at the
redeveloped Imperial War Museum in south London.
   Officials said the queen was known not to like loud bangs so the
noise was toned down when she visited a recreated brick-built
shelter like those in which Britons took refuge during the raids in
1940-42.
   In ``The Blitz Experience,'' the museum uses wartime recordings
of bombers overhead, explosions and sirens, combined with voices in
conversation, singing and screaming, and the smell of smoke, to give
visitors a taste of what it felt like to live through a raid during
the German bombardment of London's East End.

failure to pay child support.
   Attorney Rose Palermo, who was sitting in for Circuit Judge

<HEAD>Study Implicates Gene in Multiple Sclerosis Risk</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers reported evidence today that a gene
that affects disease-fighting white blood cells may help make people
susceptible to multiple sclerosis.
   If the gene is abnormal, it may prime the cells to attack normal
nerve tissue rather than germs.
   The new finding will make no immediate difference in therapy. But
scientists should be able to develop better treatments as they learn
more details about what causes the disease, said study co-author
Stephen Hauser.
   Hauser, director of the neuroimmunology unit at Massachusetts
General Hospital in Boston, reports the findings in today's issue of
the journal Cell with colleagues at the hospital and the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
   A study published earlier this year also implicated the gene in
the disease.
   An estimated 250,000 Americans have multiple sclerosis, an often
crippling condition that can produce weakness, difficulty in
coordination, dizziness and loss of balance. Scientists have long
known that genes play some role in making people susceptible.
   The disease occurs when the body, for unknown reasons, attacks
nerve tissue. Research has suggested that white blood cells called
T-cells play a critical role in the onslaught.
   As part of the immune system, T-cells normally fight invading
germs. But perhaps they attack nerve tissue instead if something
goes wrong with their mechanism for choosing targets, researchers
say.
   That mechanism involves a structure on the cell surface called a
receptor. So Hauser and his colleagues decided to study a gene that
helps determine the architecture of the receptor.
   Each person carries two versions of the receptor gene, one
inherited from each parent. The new study found that siblings who
both had the disease also tended to inherit the same versions of the
gene from their parents.
   That occurred in 15 out of 40 sibling pairs studied, while only
10 pairs would be expected to share both parental versions just by
chance.
   Only three pairs of sibling patients shared neither version, far
fewer than the 10 pairs one would expect by chance.
   In contrast, multiple sclerosis patients shared the same versions
with their healthy brothers or sisters only about as often as one
would expect by chance.
   Researchers also found evidence that the gene affected
susceptibility in 17 families with only one multiple sclerosis
patient, so it may play a role in sporadic cases, Hauser said.
   Calculations showed the gene is not the only determinant of
susceptibility. Other genes and non-genetic factors also appear to
be involved, Hauser said in a telephone interview.
   Stephen Reingold, vice president for research and medical
programs at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, called the work
``part of the puzzle'' of understanding genetic factors behind the
disease.
   Once those factors are better understood, patients who want to
have children may be able to get better counseling about the risk of
passing on susceptibility to the disease, he said.
   The new finding is encouraging because it strengthens evidence
that the T-cell receptor affects susceptibility, said Henry
McFarland, deputy chief of the neuroimmunology branch at the
National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.

<HEAD>European Beachgoers Needled by Syringes Discarded by Drug Users</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Beaches from the chic Riviera to the English
Channel are beginning to be hit by the same blight that reached
American shores last summer _ syringes.
   The needle refuse dropped by drug users on European shores hasn't
been as putrid as the waste and blood _ some of it AIDS-infected _
that washed up on the East Coast.
   No one for example is reported to have contracted any disease
from the needles but French, British and Spanish children have been
pricked. And as the number of discarded needles increases, concern
is growing over what a British newspaper calls the ``syringe peril.''
   ``We're very concerned for children. Children are going to be
digging in the sand far more than adults,'' said Peter Green,
medical officer for the south coast district of Torbay, where five
people have been treated the last month for needle injuries.
   ``The syringes have been found near what looked like burned-out
fires, and from what we deduce these are from late night drug
parties,'' Green said. ``These people are high-risk. ... We regard
their equipment as potentially dangerous.''
   In neighboring Exmouth district, five needles were found in the
last month although no one has been hurt.
   European officials see no cause for panic or closing beaches.
They are counting on public vigilance and extra cleaning.
   Torbay authorities asked owners of metal detectors for help,
while one French mayor hopes to keep addicts from nighttime forays
onto the sand.
   Brian Hayes, a painter who was scratched by a needle on a Devon
beach near Salcombe, agrees that beaches should remain open.
   ``It's not a question of scaremongering,'' he says, explaining
why he called a local radio station to tell of his plight. ``People
have to be careful where they sit and step. If I can sit on one,
anyone can.''
   On the French Riviera, a 7-year-old boy was pricked in
fashionable Cannes and a 3-year-old girl was hurt at Cap D'Ail in
June. Another child was injured several months ago on a Spanish
beach.
   Manuel Carballo, a physician from the Geneva-based World Health
Organization's Global Program on AIDS, partly blames changes in
drug-taking methods.
   ``If you are seeing more drug-injecting equipment disposed of
casually, it is because there are more drug injectors around doing
this,'' Carballo said. ``Injecting, as opposed to smoking, chewing
or sniffing, has increased.''
   Although no needles have turned up on Italian beaches, they
litter some streets. In 1988, Milan sanitation workers collected up
to 4,000 syringes a day.
   Carballo said the availability of syringes reflects the greater
use of disposable medical equipment, a factor in the appearance of
medical waste off American shores.
   He and others say that hepatitis B, with a virus more hardy than
the HIV virus associated with acquired immune deficiency syndrome,
is probably the more likely menace from the needles, although
nothing can be ruled out.
   In response to the problem, early morning cleaners in Cannes and
other Riviera cities were asked to redouble their efforts. Some
workers were given special gloves or pincers.
   ``We recommend that people use sandals or beach shoes,'' said
Green.
   He said that if pricked, people are sent to a hospital for a
serum and vaccination against hepatitis B.
   Mayor Jacques Medecin of Nice promised to try to dislodge those
who sleep or party on beaches. ``We're looking how to do it,'' he
said. ``It could be by spraying water on them all night.''
   But catching them may prove as difficult as finding needles in
the sand, say officials.
   ``If people are caught doing this, we can prosecute them,'' said
Devon County spokesman Brian Brady, referring to a 1974 pollution
act that calls for up to five years in prison and unlimited fines
for those who dispose of pharmaceutical waste illegally.
   ``It's catching them that's the difficulty,'' Brady said.

   Robert Swanson knew what to do when he saw two
men and a young boy stuck on a stalled boat in the path of oncoming
barges.
   ``They waved for help and I went over and dragged them out of the
path,'' he said. ``It was as simple as that.''
   Swanson, 46, of Burlington, Iowa, was among 20 Americans and
Canadians proclaimed heroes Thursday by the Carnegie Hero Fund
Commission. Five of the heroes died in their rescue attempts.
   Swanson was in his motorboat on the Mississippi River near
Burlington in southeastern Iowa on July 26, 1987, when he sped to
the disabled boat, grabbed a rope and towed it clear of all but one
barge.
   ``I expected the barges to cut their speed, but that didn't turn
out to be the case,'' he said. ``For a moment when they were bearing
down on us I got a little concerned.''
   The back of the idled boat was hit by one of the barges, but
remained afloat, Swanson said. No one was injured.
   Swanson said it was a thrill to be honored, but he considered his
act nothing special.
   ``I'm sure this sort of thing happens all the time,'' he said.
   Thursday's awards bring to 7,351 the number of Americans and
Canadians honored since 1904, when industrialist Andrew Carnegie
founded the organization.
   Recipients or their survivors are given $2,500 each and a bronze
medal. Some survivors receive pensions as well.
   Others honored Thursday were:
   _Billie Bonds, 49, of Aptos, Calif., and Robert E. Siegel, 38, of
Santa Cruz, Calif., who helped subdue a crazed man attacking a man
with a machete in Santa Cruz on May 20, 1988.
   _Richard G. Jordan, 42, of Edmonton, Alberta, who helped save a
12-year-old girl and her 9-year-old brother from drowning in the
Pacific Ocean at Ucluelet, British Columbia, on July 29, 1987.
   _Robert L. Carter, 27, of Milton, Del., who died 12 days after an
unsuccessful attempt to save a 7-year-old boy from drowning in the
Broadkill River in Milton, Del., on May 10, 1988.

   A black silk banner, military hat and medallions
were among the relics of Benito Mussolini that were sold to an
American for $117,400, the British auctioneers Phillips said.
   The collector and seller were not identified, nor was the U.S.

belongings after World War II.
   Among the items sold Thursday was a black fur hat with a
gold-embroidered eagle for $75,500, an auction record price for any

   Mussolini, the Fascist prime minister from 1922-43, was killed
along with his mistress Clara Petacci by communist partisans in
1945. Their bodies were strung up by the heels at a gasoline station

   Bob Boilard likes nothing better than
using President Bush as a guinea pig for his homemade fishing lures.
   ``I make lures for myself, and ... I make him my official
tester,''' Boilard said as he worked to scout out the local bluefish
in preparation for the president's long holiday weekend beginning
today.
   In an interview at his nearby Biddeford home, the 64-year-old
retired Navy man said he made a string of mackerel flies to give the
president over the weekend while Bush is at his oceanfront home.
   ``I'll say, `Good luck. If we don't catch anything, we'll get rid
of them,''' Boilard said.
   He showed off a variety of lures, some made from old spoons and
forks, and said, ``You're seeing some of the stuff the president's
going to fish with.''
   And how well does the president fish?
   ``You wouldn't put him in the class of the bass masters or what
have you, although he's been down there with the bass people, and
that's mostly what his fishing was, prior to this saltwater
involvement,'' Boilard said.
   ``But, oh, yes. He's attentive, and he's got the patience. A lot
of people say he hasn't got the patience, but I know.''
   One problem Boilard has encountered while fishing with Bush has
been the disruptive presence of Secret Service agents in other
boats. But he finally persuaded Bush to lessen the interference by
getting the agents to stay off to the side, instead of traveling in
the wake of Bush's boat.
   Boilard said he met Bush accidentally near the Saco River in
1983, not long after he retired as a mechanic at the nearby
Portsmouth Naval Shipyard.
   ``We met in the ocean,'' Boilard recalled. ``I was fishing out at
Wood Island out there at the mouth of the river, and I was just
minding my business.
   ``I didn't notice anyone else around and I heard a voice behind
me, and I was playing a bluefish at the time ... and I heard this
voice behind me: `What are you catching them on please? Oh, please,
what are you catching them on?' I turned around and said, `Oh my
gosh.'''
   After comparing lures for a few moments, Boilard told Bush, then
vice president, to follow him for a good fishing spot.
   ``So we took off and went 100 yards, 150 yards. ... I was king of
the heap.''
   Boilard recalls that Bush gave him his private phone number at
the family estate in Walkers Point and asked him to call with
fishing tips.
   Since then, they have been fishing when they can and exchanging
letters when they're unable to fish.
   In one letter to Boilard dated Feb. 24, 1988, Bush wrote:
   ``Dear Bob: Articles on both blues and mackerels made me think of
you. It was great seeing you in New Hampshire. Bob, I'm going to
win, but I'll promise you one thing. It won't affect our fishing
together.''
   But Boilard acknowledges Bush doesn't always have a lot of time
for fishing:
   ``You know the hardest thing in the world is to get that guy out
there for some time to be able to fish, to do the fishing.''

<HEAD>`Santa Barbara' Dominates Daytime Emmy Awards</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   NBC's ``Santa Barbara'' won Daytime Emmy Awards
for outstanding series and actress, sending perennial nominee Susan
Lucci home empty-handed for the 10th straight year.
   Lucci, star of ABC's ``All My Children,'' was on hand at the
Waldorf-Astoria Hotel on Thursday as former ``All My Children''
colleague Marcy Walker was honored for her role as Eden Capwell
Castillo on ``Santa Barbara.''
   Others who chose not to attend the ceremony fared better.
   Justin Deas, who plays Keith Timmons on ``Santa Barbara,''
repeated as outstanding supporting actor, but again missed the
proceedings.
   And ``Jeopardy!'' host Alex Trebek sent along his thanks after
being named best game show host. He added that if his absence helped
him win, he promised not to come again next year.''
   ``The Oprah Winfrey Show'' was recognized as best talk show for
the third straight year, and veteran broadcast personality Sally
Jessy Raphael received her first Emmy in a 30-year career, as best
daytime talk show host.
   David Canary was honored for the third time in four years for his
roles as Adam and Stuart Chandler on ``All My Children.''
   ``I don't deserve this any more than any of you, but I've got it
and I'm thrilled,'' Canary said.
   In addition to the top series, actress and supporting actor
honors, ``Santa Barbara,'' which premiered five years ago, received
its first writing award and two other acting awards in the
competition among soap operas.
   Nancy Lee Grahn, who plays Julia Wainwright on ``Santa Barbara,''
shared supporting actress honors with Debbi Morgan, Angie Hubbard of
``All My Children.''
   The young winners were the most excited.
   Juvenile male winner Justin Gocke, who plays Brandon Capwell on
``Santa Barbara,'' leaped out of his seat punching the air and ran
to the stage, where he had to stand on a box to see over the lectern.
   The next winner, Kimberly McCullough, in the juvenile female
category, had trouble catching her breath.
   ``I'm so surprised, my heart's beating so fast,'' she gasped.
McCullough plays Robin Scorpio on ABC's ``General Hospital.''
   The team at CBS' ``The Young and the Restless'' took home the
directing Emmy for the fourth straight year.
   Tribute was paid to the late Douglass Watson, who starred as
MacKenzie Cory for 16 years on ``Another World.'' Watson, a nominee
for best actor, died in May of a heart attack.
   Muppeteer Jim Henson presented a Special Emmy for Lifetime
Achievement to Joan Ganz Cooney, creator of the non-profit
corporation Children's Television Workshop, responsible for ``Sesame
Street,'' ``The Electric Company'' and ``3-2-1 Contact.''
   The children's programming categories, long the domain of
``Sesame Street'' and ``Jim Henson's Muppet Babies,'' had some new
winners this year: ``The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh'' from
ABC was named outstanding animated program, and ``Newton's Apple,''
a science program for children on PBS, won for outstanding
children's series.
   An ABC Afterschool special, ``Taking a Stand,'' a drama about
racial bigotry, won as outstanding children's special.
   CBS' ``$25,000 Pyramid'' won best game show, its fourth award in
the past five years.
   The 16th annual awards ceremony was broadcast live on NBC.
   The daytime Emmys are presented by the Academy of Television Arts
and Sciences and the National Academy of Television Arts and
Sciences. Writing and technical awards were presented Saturday in a
non-televised ceremony at the Registry Hotel in Universal City,
Calif.

<TEXT>
   A woman hacks off her husband's head with
an ax because he gave his dinner to the dog.
   A middle-aged man slaughters his cattle and cuts down his banana
trees before hanging himself.
   And a father wraps his son's hands in kerosene-soaked rags before
setting them afire because he suspected the 10-year-old of stealing
20 shillings _ the equivalent of $1.
   Such violence is increasingly common in this East African nation,
say the psychiatrists, sociologists and social workers who blame
rapid social changes for the tales of destruction, mutilation and
death that appear regularly in local newspapers.
   The traditional underpinnings of this tribal-based society are
being eroded, these experts say, as young men migrate to cities
where jobs are rare and as relationships based on money suffuse a
rural society ruled only a generation ago by kinship.
   ``It's a whole question of adjustment to dramatic change,'' said
Philista Onyanga, a sociologist at the University of Nairobi.
``We're talking about change within a generation _ urbanization and
moving to a money-based society. It used to be that authority was
based purely on age and gender.''
   In the new Kenya, respected relatives and village elders are less
likely to be consulted by, or even be available to, men and women
feeling overwhelmed by poverty and family problems. Old folklore
provides few answers to those under new kinds of stress.
   The result is a society less able to cope with rising prices, too
few jobs, too little land and increasingly elusive educational
opportunities, say Onyanga and others.
   Probably the most important support system to deteriorate has
been the local group of aunts, uncles, grandparents, parents,
cousins and siblings who provided emotional, physical and financial
support.
   ``The extended family system has been the basis of security
traditionally in this country throughout generations,'' said Sam
Gatere, a psychologist. He said its disintegration has left people
feeling ``very insecure.''
   ``My father, if he did not have a job, knew that his brother
would take care of him,'' said Gatere. ``Today, not at all. Now it's
everyone for himself.''
   Men have left rural areas in search of salaried work in the
cities, leaving the women to fend for themselves and their families,
run the farm and see to community matters traditionally dealt with
by the man.
   ``That straight away means the family dynamics change. The head
of the family shifts from the man to the wife. This is most strange
for Africa,'' said Gatere, who produces a nationally broadcast radio
show on social problems.
   University education, traditionally seen as a way to get off the
farm and into a salaried position, is becoming increasingly
expensive. And with a population expected to double in the next 16
years, an education no longer provides the promise of a better life
it once did.
   To accomodate the number of potential wage earners entering the
marketplace, Kenya says it would have to create 6.5 million jobs by
the turn of the century _ nearly twice the current number.
   ``Now education means nothing because of the population boom,''
said Onyanga. ``The situation is very frustrating when the
uneducated father finally gets his kids to school, they end up
without a job.''
   Stagnant salaries and rising prices add their own stresses.
   ``The coffee picker who loses his job and kills his family, then
himself, sees no other alternative. He has no home and no one will
care for him,'' said Gatere.
   ``They end up so frustrated, they feel there is no reason to
live,'' said Mbogori.

<TEXT>
   A Florida senator is calling for a suspension
of U.S. talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization after two
secret meetings between the Bush administration and Chairman Yasser
Arafat's second-in-command.
   And Israel is registering regret and disappointment. Ambassador
Moshe Arad called at the State Department Thursday to say PLO
terrorism is escalating and that the U.S. move has hurt chances for
holding Palestinian elections.
   Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., asked Secretary of State James A. Baker
III in a letter to suspend all contact with the PLO until Congress
can review the development in hearings and in committees.
   ``It is incomprehensible to me that the administration would
escalate its contacts with the PLO without any consultation with
Congress or any improvement in PLO behavior,'' Mack said.
   While the senator said the Bush administration had ``upgraded its
contacts,'' State Department officials said the two meetings did not
reflect a change in policy.
   The State Department confirmed that Robert Pelletreau, the U.S.
ambassador to Tunisia, met twice with Salah Khalaf, known also as
Abu Iyad, who is Arafat's security chief. There was no immediate
word on the outcome of the meetings.
   Officials said the purpose was to explore prospects for holding
elections among the 1.4 million Palestinian Arabs who live under
Israeli control on the West Bank and in Gaza.
   But Arad called on Assistant Secretary of State John Kelly to
reinforce his government's opposition to the U.S.-PLO dialogue,
which the Reagan administration opened last December after Arafat
publicly renounced terrorism and acknowledged Israel's right to
exist.
   The meetings were confirmed by the State Department only after
they were disclosed by Khalaf in an interview with the Kuwaiti news
agency KUNA.
   According to a State Department document, Terrorist Group
Profiles, the Fatah faction of the PLO, of which Khalaf is a senior
official, rejects the 1978 Camp David accords, which produced a
peace treaty between Israel and Egypt in 1979.
   Its political objective, the document says, is establishment of
an independent, secular Palestinian state. ``Originally committed to
recapturing all of Palestine, but now (it) may accept a state based
on a Gaza-West Bank formulation,'' the description of Fatah said.
   A State Department spokesman, Adam Shub, and other U.S. officials
said Pelletreau's two meetings with Khalaf did not reflect any
change in U.S. policy.
   ``Ambassador Pelletreau is our authorized channel for conducting
the U.S. dialogue with the PLO and as such he may meet with PLO
officials,'' Shub said.
   Officials who spoke only on condition of anonymity said one of
the meetings was held Monday and the other on an earlier occasion.
   The decision by former President Reagan and former Secretary of
State George P. Shultz ended a 14-year ban on U.S. policy talks and
negotiations with the PLO that had been part of an agreement in
which Israel gave up land in the Sinai it had won from Egypt in the
1967 Six-Day war.
   Israel disapproved of the U.S. move. Richard W. Murphy, the
assistant secretary of state for the Near East, offered assurances
the dialogue would be suspended if the PLO engaged in terrorism.
   In a number of incidents since then Israel has accused PLO
factions of terrorism. The State Department cautioned the PLO, but
kept talking.

   Gasoline prices on the Fourth of July weekend
are stable for the first time since the Alaska oil spill in March,
but officials in many states are still pressing oil companies to
prove they didn't use the spill to gouge consumers.
   Attorneys general in several states are investigating whether oil
refiners conspired to use the market turmoil caused by the Exxon
tanker wreck to force higher prices on gasoline wholesalers, thus
triggering big increases at the pump.
   The industry says it's not to blame, and some say the charges are
inspired by politics. Yet the oil companies are facing a level of
public suspicion about gasoline price collusion not seen in this
country since the oil crises of the 1970s.
   ``There was something very special about this leap in prices: it
was the fastest and greatest increase in the history of the United
States,'' said Trilby Lundberg of the Los Angeles-based Lundberg
Survey, which tracks gasoline prices.
   The national average retail price started the year at 98 cents a
gallon and stood at $1 a week before the March 24 spill, according
to the Lundberg Survey. Two months later the price peaked at $1.18 a
gallon, and throughout June it hovered around $1.17.
   The Energy Department says the spill cut supplies of Alaskan
crude oil by 13 million barrels over 13 days _ not enough alone to
cause a major jump in gasoline prices.
   The industry contends the price runup was caused by many factors
outside its direct control, including normal seasonal increases in
gasoline demand, higher prices for the crude oil used to make
gasoline, and tougher environmental standards for gasoline that
increased manufacturing costs.
   None of the state investigations apparently has produced
conclusive evidence of wrongdoing. Even so, some state officials
have publicly accused the companies of manipulation.
   ``Greed and collusion are the only apparent explanations for
these unwarranted price increases,'' Gray Davis, the California
state controller, told a U.S. Senate hearing last April.
   Joseph Koach, executive director of the Service Station Dealers
of America, said in an interview that the legality or fairness of
gasoline pricing can't be determined because of a lack of public
information about refiner costs.
   ``We just can't prove there's collusion, we can't prove there's
price fixing,'' he said.
   Davis and other state officials, plus some U.S. senators, have
called on the Justice Department to investigate, but it has not
indicated it will take up the matter. The Federal Trade Commission
refused requests to investigate.
   A trade group of station dealers in Washington state is launching
a statewide petition drive over the Independence Day weekend seeking
a law that would place oil refiners and their prices under state
public utility controls.
   The main organizer, Tim Hamilton, said he believed public anger
at the oil companies is great enough that he can get the 150,000
signatures he needs to place his proposal on the general election
ballot in November 1990.
   In May, officials from the attorney general offices of seven
states _ Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho, North Dakota, Alaska
and Indiana _ met with oil company officials to investigate the
reasons for the sudden price increases.
   Those officials expressed concern about possible collusion but
said more information was needed before they could reach a firm
conclusion.
   Massachusetts is conducting its own investigation, and earlier
this week the Georgia House research office issued a report that
pointed to increased profit-taking by oil refiners as a reason for
the gasoline price surge last spring.

<TEXT>
   The much-criticized practice of dual trading _
where brokers trade for themselves and their customers _ would be
restricted on the nation's major futures exchanges under legislation
proposed by the chairman of a House subcommittee.
   Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., chairman of the House Agriculture
subcommitee on credit, said Thursday he has concluded after a
five-month legislative review that ``dual trading presents possible
dangers and opportunity for abuse.''
   Critics say the practice allows brokers to take care of
themselves first, at the cost of their customers. However, defenders
say it helps ease market volatility when there are few customer
orders.
   The provisions on dual trading are among several changes English
is proposing to draw tighter rein on the futures markets.
   English's bill, which he said will be introduced July 11 when
Congress returns from its Fourth of July recess, would exempt
futures markets trading on average fewer than 7,000 contracts a day
from the dual trading prohibition.
   English also would exempt exchanges with audit systems that can
accurately track the times of trades to the nearest 30-second
interval. An accurate audit system, by comparing times and prices of
trades, allows investigators to determine whether or not brokers are
abusing dual trading.
   His bill would require exchanges to produce within a year audit
trails accurate to the closest minute and to produce within three
years audits accurate to the nearest 30 seconds.
   English's subcommittee began an investigation of dual trading in
response to revelations in January of an undercover FBI probe of
alleged abuses by as many as 100 traders in the nation's two largest
futures markets, the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   English also would give the Commodity Futures Trading Commission,
which regulates the futures markets, power to conduct undercover
probes.
   ``Allowing that kind of surveillance tells the American public
that there are watchful eyes cast upon practices and activities
which might in the past have gone unnoticed,'' he said.
   His reform proposals are being incorporated into legislation
reauthorizing the CFTC. Without the bill, the agency's legislative
permission to operate would expire Sept. 30.
   The Senate Agriculture Committee is also reviewing the agency,
but a spokesman for committee chairman Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.,
said the panel doesn't plan to act until after the completion this
summer of a report by the General Accounting Office.
   Other changes proposed by English would:
   _Protect customers from high-pressure telephone sales pitches by
providing a three-day cooling off period before customers opening
accounts by phone can begin trading.
   _Require futures exchanges to put on their governing boards more
directors without direct ties to the exchanges and trading firms.
   _Force new futures traders to attend ethics training sessions and
participate in refresher courses.
   The Futures Industry Association endorsed English's proposals.
The congressman said he will hold hearings on the bill during the
week of July 17, with a subcommittee vote to follow.

   Wojciech Jaruzelski will be remembered as

   Ramrod straight and often seemingly remote behind dark glasses

   Born July 6, 1923, to an aristocratic family in an eastern Polish
village, Jaruzelski was attending a Catholic boarding school in
Warsaw when World War II broke out.
   His official biography says he ``stayed in the northeastern
territories of the Soviet Union employed as a laborer'' during the
war.
   But Poles who know the family have said they were caught by the
Soviet occupiers and moved to Siberia, where Jaruzelski was a
baker's apprentice and his father felled logs in a labor camp until
his death.
   In 1943, Jaruzelski entered a Soviet officer training school and
then served with the communist-led Polish first army, which formed
on Russian territory and advanced with the Red Army against the
Nazis.
   A member of Poland's Communist Party since 1947, he was promoted
through the military ranks until he was named defense minister in
1968.
   In October 1981, as the euphoria and defiance of the Solidarity
movement gripped Poland, Jaruzelski was named first secretary of the
party _ the only career military officer to rise to supreme power in
the Soviet bloc.
   Two months later, Jaruzelski's dawn broadcast announced the
military had assumed power in Poland amid suggestions the martial
law decree was needed to preempt Soviet intervention.
   Through the 1980's, even as restrictions eased, Jaruzelski ruled
a dispirited Poland sliding toward economic disaster.
   Pressed by labor unrest, severe shortages and a $39 billion
foreign debt, communist authorities this year reversed course and
suggested talks with the opposition led by Solidarity, which had
never faded despite repression.
   On June 4, voters in Poland's most democratic post-war elections
delivered a stinging rejection of Jaruzelski's communist-led
coalition.
   But the atmosphere of reform has brought Jaruzelski a series of
meetings with Western leaders who are moving to resume badly needed
investments and loans that were cut off to Poland after martial law.

<HEAD>USDA Says Farmers' Prices Dipped in June</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Preliminary figures by the Agriculture
Department show that prices farmers got for raw products in June
dropped 2 percent from May but still averaged 5 percent more than a
year ago.
   The department's Agricultural Statistics Board said Thursday that
lower prices for tomatoes, cattle, wheat and corn were mostly
responsible for the decrease from the May average.
   Higher prices for lettuce, hogs, lemons and strawberries partly
offset the decline for the other commodities.
   ``The June hog price was at the highest level since August last
year,'' the report said. ``Cattle and calf prices were mixed. All
feed grain and oil seed prices decreased from May.
   ``Wheat prices were down while the rice price increased slightly.
Lower broiler prices more than offset slight increases for eggs and
turkeys.''
   Department economists say net cash income of farmers is expected
to fall 5 percent to 14 percent this year to a range of $50 billion
to $55 billion from the 1988 record of $58 billion.
   Net cash income is the amount farmers have to spend during the
year and represents the difference between gross cash income and
cash expenses. Cash income rose last year despite drought partly
because of higher market prices and crops farmers had stored from
previous harvests.
   The decline this year is expected to stem from farmers' larger
cash expenses as they boost plantings, and also because of lower
federal subsidies.
   Consumer food prices are forecast by USDA to rise an average of 4
percent to 7 percent this year, following a 4.1 percent increase in
1988.
   Based on the preliminary figures, the price index for livestock
and livestock products declined 0.6 percent from May to June but
still averaged 5.4 percent above the year-earlier level.
   Crop prices, overall, dropped 2.8 percent from May but averaged
6.2 percent more than in June 1988.
   The overall index of prices paid to farmers in June averaged 146
percent of a 1977 base used for comparison, down from a revised
record-matching 149 percent in May. That was the lowest reading
since December, when the index was 145 percent.
   The report said:
   _Cattle averaged $67.60 per 100 pounds of live weight nationally,
down from $68.80 in May but still up from $65 in June 1988. Those
are averages for all types of cattle sold as beef.
   _Hogs averaged $44.20 per 100 pounds, compared with $41.60 in May
and $47.10 a year earlier.
   _Corn, at $2.46 a bushel, was down from $2.58 in May but was up
from $2.41 in June 1988.
   _Wheat prices at the farm averaged $3.78 per bushel, compared
with $4.01 in May and $3.37 a year earlier.
   _Rice averaged $6.85 per 100 pounds, up from $6.76 in May but
well below the year-earlier level of $7.69.
   _Soybeans were $7 per bushel, compared with $7.21 in May and
$8.18 a year earlier.
   _Upland cotton was reported at 59.1 cents per pound, up from 58.8
in May but below the 62 cents of June 1988.
   _Eggs were 63.3 cents per dozen, compared with 62 cents in May
and 46.3 cents a year earlier.
   _Milk was $12.10 per 100 pounds, compared with $12.20 in May and
$11.30 a year earlier.
   _Broilers were 42.6 cents per pound, live weight, compared with
45.2 cents in May and 37.4 cents a year ago.

   Cherry production is making a slow comeback
after last year's devastation from heat and dry weather but is
lagging behind pre-drought levels, an Agriculture Department report
shows.
   Production of tart cherries is expected to be up 10 percent from
last year's harvest to 260.7 million pounds, the report said
Thursday. The 1987 harvest was 358.5 million pounds.
   Major states were forecast at: Colorado, 500,000 pounds, down
from 1.3 million in 1988; Michigan, 190 million, up from 189
million; Oregon, 7 million, up from 4 million; Pennsylvania, 5
million, down from 9 million; Utah, 18 million, up from 11 million;
and Wisconsin, 9.2 million, up from 8.9 million.
   The crop of sweet cherries was forecast at 187,000 tons, up
slightly from 186,200 last year but well below the 214,800 tons
produced in 1987.
   Department officials say sweet cherry production in the western
states is mostly quoted by the ton, while eastern practice favors
pounds. Since most production is in the West, the agency reports
sweet cherries in tons.
   Sweet cherry production forecasts were reported for: California,
27,000 tons, up from 26,000 last year; Idaho, 2,600 tons, up from
2,300; Michigan, 25,000, down from 28,000; New York, 1,300, down
from 1,400; Oregon, 50,000, down from 60,000; Pennsylvania, 800,
down from 1,200; Utah, 2,400, up from 2,000; and Washington, 78,000,
up from 62,000.
   Montana, which produced 3,300 tons of sweet cherries last year,
will not have any commercial production in 1989 because of frost
damage, the report said.

   Agriculture Department scientists say a new
compound called amitraz has proved effective against tiny mites that
infest the breathing tubes of honey bees.
   Amitraz was developed in Europe and currently is approved for use
in the United States against ticks and lice of cattle and hogs, and
against certain mites that infest pears, entomologist William T.
Wilson of the department's Agricultural Research Service said
Thursday in a report by the agency.
   In early tests at the agency's honey bee research laboratory in
Weslaco, Texas, Wilson found amitraz was ``at least 90 percent
effective'' against the tracheal mite, Acarapis woodi.
   The compound was also effective against the Varroa mite, another
major bee parasite, he said.
   Wilson said amitraz needs approval of the Environmental
Protection Agency before it can be marketed. The only approved
remedy now is menthol, which has been effective in stemming losses
to bee colonies but does not eradicate the mites.

<HEAD>Ethiopian Rebels Offer Peace Talks Without Preconditions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eritrean rebels have announced they are willing to
talk to the Ethiopian government without preconditions about ending
their 28-year war for independence.
   Isaias Afewerki, secretary general of the Eritrean People's
Liberation Front, said Thursday that three options for peace could
be discussed: independence, regional autonomy or a federation.
   He said the talks should be held in the presence of international
observers.
   ``Let's agree that we talk and talk without preconditions in the
presence of a third person and in an official meeting,'' he said at
a news conference.
   There was no immediate response from the Ethiopian government.
   Three weeks ago, Ethiopia's parliament offered to negotiate with
the rebel group. However, the Marxist government of President
Mengistu Haile Mariam ruled out the proposal the next day.
   In his comments, Afewerki accused the government of issuing
contradictory statements as ``a pre-emptive tactic to forestall
serious negotiations'' and to prolong the war.
   Eritrea, a northern province on the Red Sea, is a former Italian
colony later administered by Britain. Ethiopia incorporated it in
1962, sparking the rebellion.

<HEAD>Site Development Mortgage Insurance Program to be Canceled</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENISE CABRERA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Department of Housing and Urban Development
is canceling a $500 million mortgage loan guarantee program that one
official says is an ``absolute disaster.''
   HUD Secretary Jack Kemp ordered the troubled program canceled
Thursday, as the department said the program was ``riddled with
abuse.''
   Meanwhile, a House Government Operations subcommittee today was
beginning review of another HUD program _ the mortgage coinsurance
program _ in which a recent inspector general's audit found lenders
had underwritten $700 million in loans that defaulted by mid-1988.
   On Thursday, the subcommittee produced a government memo that
links a staffer in George Bush's vice presidential office to a
project involved in alleged influence-peddling at HUD.
   The program canceled by Kemp guarantees mortgages to finance land
acquisition and site preparation, such as street construction and
sewer line installation, for smaller developers who would include
housing for low-income and moderate income families in their
projects.
   Twenty-five of 58 projects financed through the 12-year-old Title
X Land Development Mortgage Insurance Program have defaulted,
costing the government $90 million, the department said.
   About $500 million in loans were guaranteed since 1977.
   ``This program was an absolute disaster,'' said HUD spokesman Bob
Nipp.
   Kemp said application fees will be returned for projects that
have not yet been approved. Projects with initial approval or with
commitments for funds will be reviewed ``to determine whether fraud
or misrepresentation warrant the denial of government insurance,''
he said.
   The department will publish a proposed regulation to ``terminate
the program due to the enormity of the losses involved, high
patterns of abuse and the failure of the program to benefit the
needy,'' the department's announcement said.
   The Reagan administration sought legislation to abolish the
program but was unsuccessful. Kemp's proposed regulation must remain
open for a period of public comment before it can become final.
   President Bush earlier this week accepted some responsibility for
scandals which have surfaced alleging influence-peddling and
mismanagement in several HUD programs while he was Ronald Reagan's
vice president.
   ``If you want to assign blame to the vice president for what
happened over the past ... eight years, OK, that's fine, I accept
it,'' said the president.
   The June 1987 memo from Deborah Gore Dean, former executive
assistant to then-Housing Secretary Samuel Pierce, detailed more
than $2 million in funding from HUD to Bayamon, Puerto Rico, during
fiscal years 1986 and 1987.
   The memo was sent to Tony Benedi, coordinator of special projects
in the vice president's office, and provided the information ``per
your request.''
   A Bayamon project in which Fred Bush _ former deputy chief of
staff for then-Vice President Bush _ earned $253,000 as a consultant
had been included in an inspector general's audit of HUD's moderate
rehabilitation program.
   Fred Bush was a key fundraiser for George Bush's 1988
presidential campaign but is no relation to the president.
   Bush, who also is ambassador-designate to Luxembourg, used his
second appearance before the panel to make ``clarifying statements''
to the testimony he gave on May 25.
   Bush had testified he contacted Ms. Dean about a project in
Bayamon after finding her name in an executive federal telephone
directory. Several panel members had questioned that account.
   But on Thursday Bush said one of his former colleagues reminded
him that Ms. Dean's name was first raised at a social gathering when
the colleague was talking with another former HUD official, Hunter
Cushing.
   ``My colleague's recollection is that Mr. Cushing told him we
should talk to Deborah Gore Dean,'' Bush said.
   Bush said he didn't know Dean so he consulted the directory,
subsequently called Dean and later met with her at her office to
discuss the project.

   Another foreign policy success, on top of his
NATO triumph, awaits President Bush next week in Eastern Europe
unless he runs into an unexpected snag.
   Poland and Hungary, members of the Warsaw Pact, are aching to be
encouraged by the President to sample a few more whiffs of
capitalism.
   And who is Bush to say no?
   He will take with him a package of incentives, carefully tied to
good management in Warsaw and Budapest, and then at a summit meeting
in Paris with the leaders of six other industrial democracies, Bush
will urge others to provide their support as well.
   The Hungarians, even their communist leadership, are eager to
sample Western ways. So are the Poles, and they are dragging their
government along.
   It adds up to a unique opportunity for Bush for back-to-back
successes in Europe.
   Last month, at the NATO summit meeting in Brussels, he unveiled a
proposal for reductions of troops, tanks, artillery and other
armament in Europe that countered Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's bold initiatives.
   Apart from the public relations dividend, Bush's move set the
table for the two alliances to reach an accord that would require
far greater arms reductions by Moscow than by Washington.
   The risk is that Bush might upset the Soviets. But Gorbachev has
acknowledged his own economy needs an overhaul. And he's offering
his people a heady mixture of glasnost, or openness, and
perestroika, or restructuring.
   Bush said at a news conference this week that Gorbachev shouldn't
get ``uptight'' about next month's trip. Treading carefully, he said
he would not exhort the Poles or the Hungarians into actions that
could provoke repression.
   Considering Gorbachev's own program at home, and the enormous
cost to the Soviets of carrying the East European economies on their
back, the president is likely to succeed in his campaign to
stimulate _ and symbolize _ democracy.
   The Soviets sent tanks into Hungary in 1956 and into
Czechoslovakia in 1968 to put down reform movements.
   This time around, Hungary and Poland are following on the heels
of Soviet reform and are not dropping out of the Warsaw Pact.
   Playing it safe, Bush described his immediate objectives this
way: ``I want to see a much more open Europe. And I think that the
importance of the visit is along that line. It's not going to be
that we're going to solve the problem of the Hungarian economy or
the Polish economy.''
   At the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, optimism
for economic reforms in Eastern Europe is unbridled. The
recommendation to the White House is for an activist policy to take
advantage of this opening.
   Burton Yale Pines, the director of research, said Bush's trip
could produce the first U.S. policy for Eastern Europe since World
War II.
   ``The United States has never had a policy toward Eastern
Europe,'' Pines, a former Time magazine correspondent, said. ``We've
had ad hoc responses.''
   Earlier trips to the region by Presidents Richard Nixon and Jimmy
Carter were designed ``to tweak'' Moscow, Pines said. In the summer
of 1989, he said, the circumstances are different.
   Bush will visit as Moscow is rethinking its role in the region.
Gorbachev has offered to withdraw some troops and tanks from the
East. The NATO-Warsaw Pact negotiations in Vienna could produce a
wholesale reduction in forces.
   ``If Soviet troops really pull out you are giving a green light
to reform,'' Pines said.
   Kim R. Holmes, director of foreign policy research at Heritage,
stressed the economic burden the East Europeans are to Moscow's own
sagging economy.
   ``Eastern Europe is an economic basket case, plagued with low
productivity, low motivation, an increasingly obsolete industrial
base, an ecological crisis and a debt to the West of over $1
billion,'' he said.
   According to Holmes, the Soviets spend an estimated $21 billion
to $30 billion a year for trade subsidies and credits, and economic
and military aid _ beyond what it costs Moscow to maintain its
troops in Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary and Poland.
   ``Gorbachev may be willing to consider a partial and gradual
disengagement from Eastern Europe in order to preserve the power of
the Communist Party at home and to concentrate on resolving his own
economic crisis,'' the Heritage official said.

   Things have panned out nicely for Norma
Grundy's collection.
   As a nurse, she was no stranger to the bedpan; as an
administrator, she is surrounded by them.
   ``I came by it honestly because I'm a nurse,'' Ms. Grundy said.
``You know, they're fun to look at.''
   Ms. Grundy, nursing director and clinic administrator of the
mental health division at the University of California, Irvine, has
lined her office walls with 44 bed pans of varying sizes, colors and
composition.
   Some are decorated with flowers, small stuffed animals and
decoupage poems. Others hang bare, including plastic models of the
modern variety in red, white and blue.
   ``I have the most fantastic collection you can imagine,'' she
said. ``It's fun looking for them and adding to the collection.''
   They may be called bedpans by most people today, Ms. Grundy said,
but those who used them decades ago affectionately referred to them
as ``chamber pots,'' ``thunder mugs'' and ``chambers of delight.''
   Ms. Grundy, 58, credits her father for starting the collection,
but the display came from a colleague.
   ``One of the psychiatrists on the staff thought my office wasn't
bright enough and brought in an 18th-century French chamber pot, and
that started the office decoration,'' she said.
   Ms. Grundy's collection was put to good use at a university
chancellor's retirement party four years ago, when she and her
students wore hospital gowns and body stockings while carrying the
bedpans.
   ``We used them for drums and we won first place for the best
costumes,'' she said.
   Many of her bedpans have come from people who knew of her
collection.
   ``I got one from someone who was tearing down their house and
found it in a closet, and another from a student who saw it on top
of a trash can,'' she said.

   Flazey, the grouper that ate $5,000
worth of exotic fish in an Illinois pet shop, has returned to Fort
Lauderdale and may become a meal for someone else.
   Terry Haley, an aquarium store owner from Lansing, Ill., finally
wearied of the grouper's taste for his expensive tankmates. He plans
to release his prize glutton Monday in the ocean off Fort Lauderdale.
   The name Flazey _ a combination of ``fat and lazy'' _ was chosen
in a contest for Illinois schoolchildren.
   The fish was a foot long and weighed 3 pounds when Haley bought
it from a Fort Lauderdale aquarium supplier. But after 1{ years of
eating its way through the 1,100-gallon tank in Haley's shop, Flazey
measures 3{ feet and weighs 35 pounds.
   The grouper attracted nationwide attention in May when Haley
complained about it eating dozens of expensive fish. All on top of
its regular diet of 5 pounds of smelt every other day.
   Neither the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago nor the Indianapolis Zoo
wanted the fish. A seafood restaurant expressed interest, but Haley
did not have the heart to fillet his star attraction.
   About 10 days ago, Flazey got its last meal from Haley. He put a
drug in Flazey's tank, temporarily anesthetizing the fish, and
shipped him by air to Noyes Marine Life, the Fort Lauderdale
aquarium supplier that sold the grouper to Haley. The brown spotted
fish will stay there until Haley flies down to release it.
   Bob Stewart, owner of Noyes Marine Life, said Flazey seemed to be
adjusting well. Haley was glad to hear that, adding:
   ``He hasn't been fed for a week to 10 days. He's probably ready
for some fish.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arctic ground squirrels sleep serenely through
Alaskan winters even though their body temperatures cool to a point
that would cause other mammals to freeze solid, a researcher says in
a study published today.
   Brian M. Barnes, an assistant professor at the University of
Alaska, Fairbanks, said thermometers surgically implanted inside
hibernating Arctic ground squirrels showed the furry animals suffer
no ill effects from body temperatures that dip five degrees below
the freezing point of water.
   No other mammal is known to be able routinely survive such a deep
body chill, Barnes said Thursday in a telephone interview.
   ``The mechanism by which they do this is still unknown,'' said
Barnes. But the secret could have an important use in the
transplantation of human organs, the researcher said.
   Barnes studied the hibernation of the ground squirrels by
surgically implanting radio-transmitting thermometers into their
abdominal cavities. Signals from the thermometers provided readings
of body temperature throughout the eight months the animals lived in
hibernation burrows two to three feet underground in a research area
in northern Alaska.
   Between February and March, while temperatures dropped to minus
60 outside and to about minus one inside the underground burrows,
Barnes reports in Science magazine that the body temperatures of the
ground squirrels ranged from 26.7 to 30 degrees.
   The squirrels roused at intervals during the deep winter months
and their temperatures went up briefly to the mid-80s, but the
animals quickly settled back into hibernation torpor and body
readings again dropped to below freezing.
   In the spring, Barnes said the implanted thermometers were
removed and retested to make sure the surprisingly low readings were
correct. He assured that the procedure was done surgically and
``those animals are all alive today and on their way toward another
hibernation season.''
   Some insects and some fish can survive sub-freezing temperatures
by producing substances, called glycoproteins, that prevent ice from
forming in blood and tissues. But Barnes said an analysis of blood
samples from hibernating Arctic ground squirrels show the animals do
not use such temperature defenses.
   The researcher said the squirrels could be using a system that
gives ice crystals no means to form within the circulating blood.
   In order for ice to form easily, Barnes said there has to be a
seed crystal around which water in the body could freeze. The ground
squirrel body could somehow block such crystals, he said.
   ``They could simply rid their body of potential nucleators or
seed crystals, but that's only speculation,'' said Barnes. ``Many
insects do this to even much lower temperatures, as do some fish
that live at bottom in waters that are below (freezing).''
   Arctic ground squirrels weigh about two pounds and are more than
a foot long. Most of their lives are spent hibernating through the
long Alaskan winters. They emerge in June for a frenzy of feeding
and mating, and then return to their burrows in September before the
ground freezes again.
   Barnes said understanding the ground squirrel's unique ability to
thrive after enduring sub-freezing body temperatures could help
medical science learn how to preserve human organs for
transplantation. Donated organs now must be transplanted within
hours after removal or they become useless.
   A report on Barnes' study is published today in Science, the
journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

<HEAD>Consumer Groups Protest Speeded-up Poultry Inspection</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Much of the nation's chicken supply is not safe
to eat, some consumer groups say, but the Agriculture Department
strongly disagrees.
   Much of the consumer complaint involves speeded-up poultry
inspection procedures, which advocates say put too many dirty birds
on family tables.
   The Community Nutrition Institute and the Government
Accountability Project also said Thursday that USDA has suppressed
test results showing that harmful bacteria, primarily salmonella,
contaminate the nation's poultry supply to a far greater extent than
acknowledged publicly.
   Rod Leonard, executive director of the institute, said American
consumers ``have at least one chance in two of being exposed to
salmonella poisoning every time they eat chicken.''
   Food poisoning caused by salmonella can cause stomach ache and
diarrhea and can be severe in children, older people and those with
impaired immune systems.
   Leonard said he had two basic recommendations for consumers:
don't eat chicken. But if you do, handle with care.
   More than 5.1 billion broilers, or young chickens, were produced
last year, most of them winding up on consumer menus.
   Tom Devine of GAP, which describes itself as a whistle-blower
support group, said he had no position on whether to give up chicken
but wanted to see the federal inspection system improved.
   But a USDA spokeswoman said federally inspected poultry and meat
``are certainly safe to eat'' and that the rate of salmonella
contamination is not as high as claimed by Leonard and Devine.
   Karen Stuck of the department's Food Safety and Inspection
Service said her agency's procedures ``are tested and fine-tuned''
before allowed in general use by plants.
   ``They're tested against the old system and implemented only if
we are certain that they're not going to reduce public health
protection,'' she said.
   The main problem, according to Leonard and Devine, stems from
decisions made since the late 1970s to accelerate line speeds at
poultry slaughter plants. In some cases since then, they said,
speeds have been increased from 30 or so birds per minute to more
than 100.
   As a consequence, Leonard and Devine said at a news conference,
there has been a steady increase in the ``cross-contamination'' of

<HEAD>Police Arrest Suspect in Poisoning of Legendary Tree</HEAD>

   Police arrested a farm supply salesman and charged
him with criminal mischief in the poisoning of the legendary Treaty
Oak during what was described as a ritual.
   Paul Stedman Cullen, 45, of Elroy, was being held in lieu of
$20,000 bail in connection with pouring the powerful herbicide
Velpar around Treaty Oak, authorities announced in a Thursday news
conference at the centuries-old tree.
   Legend has it that Stephen F. Austin, the father of Texas, signed
the first boundary agreement between the Indians and settlers under
the oak's branches.
   ``The arrest is a tribute to both the good work of the Austin
Police Department and to the caring of this community,'' said
District Attorney Ronald Earle, noting that several residents phoned
in tips.
   The Treaty Oak is struggling to survive the poisoning, which has
received national attention on network television and in newspapers.
   Cullen was arrested Thursday morning near a farm and ranch supply
store where he worked, said Police Sgt. John Jones, who investigated
the case. The warrant said Cullen acquired Velpar through the
business.
   An arrest warrant authorized by State District Judge Jon Wisser
said Cullen poisoned the Treaty Oak ``in a ritual.''
   Wisser said that before the judge signed the warrant
investigators told him Cullen had checked out books from the public
library on black magic and the occult.
   Earlier, the Austin-American Statesman reported an unidentified
suspect in the poisoning had been trying to cast a spell to protect
a woman or because of a rivalry over a woman.
   Cullen was charged with second-degree felony criminal mischief
and faces a maximum of 20 years in prison and a $10,000 fine if
convicted. A prior felony conviction would allow that to be raised
to a first-degree felony, with a maximum punishment of life in
prison and a $20,000 fine, Earle said.
   The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles said Cullen was released
from prison on March 19, 1987, after serving three months of a
two-year sentence for burglary in Travis County.
   Cullen was under parole supervision until December 30, 1988, said
Karin Armstrong, spokeswoman for the board of pardons and paroles.
   Wisser said Jones told him he had listened to a tape on which
Cullen said he poisoned the tree. Jones said last week that several
callers identified the same suspect and that the man supposedly had
told others about the episode.
   Officers searched for further evidence in a makeshift trailer
where Cullen lives on the grounds of the farm and ranch supply
business in suburban Austin.
   After the attack was discovered early this month, $11,000 was
offered for information leading to the conviction of the poisoner.
Du Pont, which makes Velpar at a plant in La Porte, put up $10,000
of the reward, and the Texas Forestry Association added $1,000.
   Dallas billionaire H. Ross Perot has pledged money and given
advice in the effort to save the tree, and state and national
experts have recommended several forms of treatment. Visitors have
left flowers and get-well messages at the oak.

<HEAD>Doctor Will Have to Volunteer at Homeless Clinic For Prank</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A young doctor who jokingly taped a
bandage marked ``Do not resuscitate'' on the head of an injured
drifter has been ordered to perform 100 hours of community service
at a clinic for the homeless.
   Administrators at Humana Hospital of Louisville said Thursday
that the doctor will be required to donate the hours at St. John's
Health Center to complete a three-year residency in emergency
medicine at the hospital.
   The doctor has not been identified because of student privacy
laws, officials said.
   The message, taped to the head of Lewis Woodard, 52, is meant for
use only with terminally ill patients. Woodard had been treated June
15 for injuries suffered in a beating.
   After his wounds were stitched and dressed, Woodard was released
from the hospital wearing the bandage.
   ``I was irate,'' said Sister Mary Kathleen Sheehan, the director
of St. John's, where Woodard stays. ``Suppose he had an asthma
attack and that thing was on his head. He just lies there and dies.
... A lot of people are upset about it, to say the least.''
   David Glaspie, administrator of the homeless clinic, said the
free help would be welcome. The clinic currently has one doctor who
puts in four hours three days a week and a podiatrist who treats
foot problems for two hours one day a week.
   But the long-term payoff may be even bigger. Glaspie has talked
with Dr. Donald M. Thomas, chairman of the University of Louisville
School of Medicine's department of emergency medicine, about
strengthening the ties between the hospital and the homeless clinic.
   One possibility, Thomas said, would be to make a stint of service
at the clinic a regular part of the program for residents in
emergency medicine.
   ``It's a very unfortunate incident but I really think it'll bring
the two groups closer together,'' Thomas said.
   Dr. Salvator Vicario, residency director for emergency medicine,
said the doctor told him that the message was meant as joke to be
seen only by other workers in the emergency room. The doctor said he
expected that someone would remove the piece of tape before Woodard
left the hospital, Vicario said.
   Vicario said emergency-room residents are often disturbed by the
apparent futility of giving care to homeless alcoholics who are
sometimes uncooperative and frequent patients.
   ``I think he was just frustrated,'' Vicario said.
   He said the doctor had put about 60 stitches into Woodard's head
wounds and had done the job well.

   The government is trying to collect almost
$73,000 from a bank and the estate of a one-time housing broker in
Buffalo, N.Y., who auditors say withheld payments and overbilled the
Department of Housing and Urban Development.
   Maureen Brady, the widow of former broker Bernard A. Brady,
apparently forged his name to withdraw $20,100 from a HUD escrow
account after he died in 1987, according to the federal audit.
   The audit said Brady mixed HUD funds with his own money in the
account, withheld HUD payments, overbilled the department and paid
himself advances.
   HUD is having trouble collecting the $72,970 owed by the Bradys,
said Joseph B. Lynch, manager of HUD's Buffalo field office. Both
Mrs. Brady and the bank involved have agreed to repay the money,
although it is unclear when, he said.
   The bank account was frozen but HUD has been unable to get at the
money, believed to be $48,139, Lynch said. The Brady estate is
liable for the balance.
   HUD plans no criminal prosecution ``because of the amount
involved,'' according to A. Paul Kane, the agency's regional
inspector general for audit.
   Lynch said Mrs. Brady apparently forged her husband's signatures
on the checks but that all the missing money was accounted for.
   Brady had been a closing agent on the sale of single-family HUD
homes and manager of at least one HUD rental property, according to
the audit, which covered Jan. 1, 1985 to Dec. 31, 1987. He died of
cancer May 10, 1987, after a long illness, Lynch said.
   Kane blamed the field office for not keeping closer tabs on what
Brady was doing, and said it was the lawyer for the Brady estate,
Harold Fein, who brought problems with the bank account to the local
office's attention.
   For the 18 months from April 1985 to September 1986, Brady
submitted no monthly accounting reports to the department, as
required under his contract.
   At the same time, however, Brady was not paid about $26,000 in
monthly management fees from the department, the audit found. He
also wired the same $12,500 in net sales proceeds twice to the U.S.
Treasury, and overpaid HUD several hundred dollars in other cases.
   The audit, dated Jan. 19, was obtained under the Freedom of
Information Act.

<HEAD>Seven Hazardous Waste Sites Were Permitted To Expand, GAO Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   States have permitted the expansion of seven
hazardous waste landfills that are on the Superfund cleanup list,
according to a congressional report.
   Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa., said the study by the General
Accounting Office illustrated the mounting trash problem the nation
faces. It may only show ``the tip of the iceberg with regard to
landfill expansions,'' he said.
   Goodling and Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., requested the nationwide
survey by the GAO, the investigative arm of Congress.
   The report released Thursday found that 14 landfills on the
Environmental Protection Agency's Superfund list had applied to
states to expand between October 1986 and October 1988, and that
seven had been approved. One permit was denied and six were pending
as of late last year, the GAO said.
   Three of the seven landfills allowed to expand are in
Pennsylvania. The others are in Colorado, Indiana, Oklahoma and
Wisconsin, GAO said.
   It did not identify the landfills.
   There are no rules against Superfund sites expanding. In all but
the Oklahoma case, state approval was contingent on a site cleanup
plan, the report said. Oklahoma mandates either that the original
site be closed before expansion or that the landfill owner post a
bond to guarantee adequate cleanup, according to the report.
   The Superfund program was created in 1980 to protect water and
air from the dangers posed by hazardous waste sites. Under the
program, states track down individuals or companies responsible for
the problem and make them pay for the cleanup.

<HEAD>Foreign Aid Bill Faces Uncertain Future in Senate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House-passed $22.8 billion foreign aid bill,
including new economic sanctions against China for its crackdown on
the democracy movement, is on its way to the Senate where it faces
an uncertain future.
   The House approved the measure on an overwhelming 314-101 vote
Thursday, venting its anger over the situation in China by adding
the sanctions over mild protests from the Bush administration.
   The final vote was unusually strong for a foreign aid bill, which
traditionally engenders little enthusiasm in Congress.
   ``This is one of the best foreign aid bills we've passed,'' said
an ebullient Rep. William Broomfield of Michigan, the senior
Republican on the Foreign Affairs Committee. ``I've never seen
anything like it. There's momentum and confidence and respect by
both parties.''
   The measure provides about $11.5 billion each in fiscal 1990 and
1991 for military, economic and development aid to dozens of
friendly nations around the globe.
   As it moved toward final passage, the House adopted an amendment
softening restrictions on the administration that were intended to
head off efforts to generate third-country support for the
Nicaraguan Contra rebels. The Bush administration had warned the
restrictions could be grounds for a presidential veto of the entire
bill.
   With that change, the administration seemed inclined to
grudgingly declare victory and work for further changes when the
bill goes to the Senate.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, asked about the unanimous
House vote for new China sanctions, said Thursday evening: ``We will
review the bill ... We believe it's unnecessary, but we'll take a
look at it when we see it.''
   ``We made a lot of progress,'' said one State Department source,
speaking only on condition of anonymity. The China sanctions the
House adopted were milder than the administration had feared from a
Congress that has voiced impatience with Bush's cautious response to
Beijing's bloody crackdown.
   The measure still is far from certain to become law. The Senate
Foreign Relations Committee has shown little interest in working on
its version of the bill this year, often failing to even get a
quorum.
   On the matter of China, the House endorsed Bush's previous moves
to condemn government violence, halt military aid and ban exchanges
of military officials and high-level visits.
   But the package _ passed on a 418-0 vote _ went a step further,
adding suspension of trade and development programs, a ban on the
sale of police equipment and a limit on transfer of high-technology
and nuclear materials or components.
   ``The Chinese leadership should be aware there is a very
deep-seated revulsion in Congress about the barbarian tactics they
have employed,'' said Broomfield, who helped draft the sanctions.
   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., noted that the
administration opposed the China sanctions as robbing it of
flexibility and infringing on presidential foreign policy
prerogatives.
   But he added: ``I think someone in this government _ and today
it's the House _ has to speak clearly on behalf of the American
people and take more forceful action than the president and the
secretary of state have been to date willing to take.''
   Before the vote, Secretary of State James A. Baker III had
rejected the package, declaring that human rights ``is not the only
principle which determines our foreign policy.''

<HEAD>Mortgage Bankers, GNMA Angry Over Foreclosure Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mortgage lenders and the government corporation
that finances veterans' loans have mounted separate challenges of a
new policy covering how the Veterans Affairs Department handles
property in default.
   Both the 2,200-member Mortgage Bankers Association and the
Government National Mortgage Association say a new way of assessing
the cost to the VA of taking over defaulted property will add insult
to an already injured program.
   It could also curtail the program that provides mortgages with
special terms to veterans, they say.
   Under assault is the proposal by the department to add borrowing
costs to the formula for determining whether to acquire a foreclosed
home and sell it or let the private lender take it over. Such costs
as cleanup, repair and commissions already are included in
determining the ``net fair value'' of property.
   The borrowing costs would take into account money used to acquire
the home until it could be resold.
   The department announced March 31 that the new policy would take
effect Aug. 1. The lenders filed suit Wednesday in U.S. District
Court for the District of Columbia asking to block the order. So
far, no action has been taken.
   Louis C. Gasper, the executive vice president of the Government
National Mortgage Association, or Ginnie Mae, voiced his concerns to
Veterans Secretary Edward J. Derwinski in a letter May 5 that was
made public this week.
   ``Our losses on VA loans have rapidly mounted during the past 18
months until we consider them to be the number one threat to the
viability of the concept of a government-guaranteed, mortgage-backed
security program,'' Gasper wrote.
   Ginnie Mae sells securities that are backed by the mortgages.
   Gasper said six lenders have defaulted recently on their
obligations to the Ginnie Mae, mostly as a result of the growing
tendency of the veterans department to ``no-bid'' on foreclosures.
   When the department does not bid on the foreclosure of a
government-guaranteed home, the lender must acquire and dispose of
the property, adding to its losses, the MBA said in a statement
accompanying the lawsuit. The department then pays only the portion
of the loan that it originally guaranteed, which is 40 percent or 50
percent, up to $36,000.
   The lenders group, whose members hold 80 percent of veterans
department loans, says the loss to its members for each piece of
property not acquired by the agency will be $18,000. Both sides say
the department will take over in 10 percent fewer foreclosures as a
result of the higher net fair value that results from the new
formula.
   Thomas W. Maher, assistant director for property management at
agency said the problem of defaults and foreclosures appears to be
abating. In the peak month of December 1987, there were 16,200
defaults. There were 13,600 at the end of May this year.
   There were 22,200 foreclosures as of December 1987, compared with
20,100 in May, he said.

<HEAD>American Beaches Yield 1,000 Tons of Trash</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   There were plastic cups and bottles by the tens
of thousands and almost as many metal cans.
   Bottle caps alone totaled 42,671, nothing compared to the 78,025
plastic trash bags, or the 65,819 pieces of jagged glass.
   And one can't forget the bedsprings, mattresses, even a kitchen
sink or two _ or the 11 bottles containing notes from far-off
places. And finally, the 1,718 plastic syringes and other medical
wastes, not to mention the set of dentures.
   From the Washington state coast to the Louisiana delta and on to
Maine, thousands of volunteers combed 3,500 miles of beaches last
fall _ about a fourth of the country's ocean shoreline _ and those
were only some of the items they found.
   The Center for Marine Conservation, a private conservation group,
tabulated the findings and detailed them in a report Thursday
entitled ``Trash on America's Beaches: A National Assessment.''
   ``We were definitely amazed at the numbers,'' said Kathryn
O'Hara, director of the project.
   What became clear in the cleanup campaign _ actually no more than
three hours on any beach area last September and early October _ was
that America's beaches are littered with trash, said the report.
   The 47,000 volunteers found and recorded 1,973,995 pieces of
debris from discarded fishing lines to unwanted underwear. The items
weighed more than 1,000 tons, or nearly 600 pounds of debris for
every mile of beach. More than half of the items counted were made
of plastic.
   While medical wastes have garnered much of the public's
attention, Ms. O'Hara said ``plastic debris is the No. 1 enemy of
America's beaches and coastal areas.''
   The trash can be deadly.
   ``Thousands of marine mammals, sea turtles, seabirds and fish die
every year when entangled in debris items such as rope, nets and ...
fishing line, or from ingesting items like plastic bags and
sheeting, mistaking them for food,'' said the group's report.
   Despite the uproar about medical wastes, only a small percentage
of the items were reported in that category. The volunteers recorded
finding 1,718 plastic syringes during their searches, which accounts
for less than one-tenth of 1 percent of all the debris found,
according to the findings.
   Ms. O'Hara said other medical wastes were not specifically
counted in a category, although volunteers noted finding such items
as plastic gloves, hospital caps, plastic tubing.
   By far the greatest amount of trash involved some sort of plastic
product: 78,025 plastic trash bags, 26,148 milk or water jugs,
19,300 plastic bleach cleaner bottles, 14,721 foamed trays, and
9,526 egg cartons.
   Among the ``dirty dozen'' items, glass beverage bottles ranked
No. 6, with 95,028 bottles littering the beaches. In addition to the
tens of thousands of pieces of glass, the volunteers also found
light bulbs, fluorescent light tubes, wooden crates, assorted
fishing lines, rubber gloves, fishing nets, and 857 plastic hard
hats.
   And 11 volunteers found bottles with messages inside, including
one on a Connecticut beach that said it had been dumped into the
water in Europe.
   And the volunteers at times uncovered not trash, but cash _
including a $100 bill on a Texas beach and a diamond and amethyst
necklace in Florida, according to the report.
   Some states had more trash than others. Here are the states where
the most pounds of debris per miles of beach were recovered: Georgia
(4,000), Texas (3,549), Mississippi (3,000) and Louisiana (2,337).

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reformers say President Bush's proposals for
revising congressional campaign finances are inadequate. And
Democrats say they amount to hardball party politics.
   ``He has chosen to submit proposals that blatantly favor the
Republican Party and jeopardize bipartisan efforts already
underway'' to draft a campaign reform bill, said House Speaker
Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash.
   Bush announced Thursday proposals he said would help curb the
influence of special interests and reduce the advantage
congressional incumbents have over challengers.
   ``We must do more to truly clean up the system,'' he said.
   Bush said he supported cutting back on the free-postage privilege
for lawmakers, which he said pays for ``mass mailings that amount to
political advertising.'' He called for new laws to do away with
gerrymandering, the drawing of oddly-shaped congressional districts
to help certain candidates.
   Political action committees connected with businesses, labor or
trade groups should be banned, he said, and contribution ceilings to
other PACs cut from $5,000 to $2,500.
   But the president declined to endorse public financing of
congressional campaigns, a favorite idea of many reformers, or
overall campaign spending limits that have been urged by Democratic
officials as well as private groups.
   Fred Wertheimer, president of Common Cause, a good-government
group that has lobbied for changes in campaign law, said Bush's plan
``will not solve the basic campaign finance problems facing Congress
today.''
   To accomplish that, it would have to also include overall
spending limits, public financing, and shutting down so-called
``soft money'' _ prohibited corporate and union financing that
enters campaigns through loopholes in current law. Bush said he
would favor disclosure of soft money.
   Bob Dreyfuss, spokesman for the advocacy group Public Citizen,
said that in dismissing public financing and spending limits, Bush
``tends to really allow the people with money to have undue
influence in politics.''
   Bush said public financing would exclude individuals from the
political process by denying them the opportunity to contribute, and
spending limits would discourage them from contributing.
   Bush's proposals to reduce the advantages of incumbency would
naturally hurt more Democrats than Republicans because there are
more Democrats in Congress.
   But Democrats said Bush's plan was also carefully crafted to
coddle the types of donations Republicans are more likely to get and
shut down Democratic funding sources.
   ``A totally partisan package has been set forward,'' said Rep.
Beryl Anthony, D-Ark., chairman of the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee. He called it ``a P.R. effort on the part of the
president'' that ``appears to have been written by (Republican
National Chairman) Lee Atwater and (GOP House campaign chief) Ed
Rollins.''
   Although Bush proposed to restrict political action committees,
he would allow continuation of ``ideological'' PACs, many of which
are one-issue groups which favor Republican causes.
   He would also ban lawmakers from carrying campaign funds from one
election to the next, a practice which helps senior Democratic
incumbents scare off challengers.
   Meanwhile, Bush would more than double the amount of money that
political parties _ where big contributors have given the GOP a
fund-raising advantage _ can give to their congressional candidates.
   Rep. Al Swift, D-Wash., said that proposal would funnel more
money from the wealthy to the candidates while avoiding disclosure
of the source of the money.
   ``This really just sets up another `hide-and-go-seek' game,'' but
does nothing to solve the problem of soaring spending on political
campaigns, said Swift, co-chairman of a bipartisan House task force
on campaign reform due to present a report later this year.

<HEAD>House Panel Gives Momentum to Ban on Oil Drilling</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A move to halt new offshore oil exploration is
gaining momentum in Congress where the Exxon Valdez disaster hangs
like an oil slick over the debate on opening new coastal areas to
the petroleum industry.
   The House Appropriations Committee approved legislation Thursday
calling for a moratorium on new oil and gas exploratory leases along
vast stretches of coastal waters from the Georges Bank off New
England to Alaska's Bristol Bay.
   The measure is likely to clear the House, and the White House has
begun to focus on the Senate in hopes of blocking final approval of
the ban, which President Bush maintains will threaten the country's
domestic energy needs.
   The moratorium, included in an $11.6 billion fiscal 1990 money
bill for the Interior Department, prompted heated debate before
clearing the committee by voice vote after two damaging amendments
were defeated by votes of 28-22 and 29-22.
   But the debate made clear the deep concern felt by many members
of Congress over the possibility of an oil spill _ a concern spawned
by the March 24 Exxon spill in Alaska and intensified by three
recent smaller spills in Rhode Island, Delaware and Texas.
   ``We've got to wait,'' argued Rep. Silvio Conte, R-Mass., urging
approval of the yearlong moratorium on further offshore oil
exploration until better safeguards are shown to protect against an
oil spill.
   ``We've seen what's happened in Prince William Sound'' in Alaska,
declared Rep. Sidney Yates, D-Ill., adding that ``the same potential
damage'' is present in other coastal areas.
   Opponents of the moratorium, which would prohibit the Interior
Department from issuing offshore oil leases until October 1990 in
the areas affected, argued that such delays would seriously harm the
country's energy policy.
   ``What we're doing in the name of the environment is cutting off
our (domestic) energy sources. ... We're going to have brownouts and
then there will be blackouts,'' argued Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La.
   Rep. Ralph Regula, R-Ohio, argued that the Bristol Bay leases
pose no environmental threat to the bay area, one of the country's
premier commercial fishing areas, although the oil would be
transported by tanker.
   The Interior Department last year sold six leases in Bristol Bay
for exploratory drilling for $95 million, but will have to buy them
back if the moratorium clears Congress.
   An exploratory drilling moratorium already has been in effect on
leases in many of the areas included in the legislation, but the oil
industry had hoped before the Alaska spill that some of those bans
would be lifted this year. Instead, the moratorium would be extended
another year and expanded.
   The legislation would extend or impose a ban on exploratory
drilling until October 1990 off California, off southwestern
Florida's Everglades, in the Georges Bank off New England, and along
a 50-mile wide coastal strip from Rhode Island to Maryland.
   ``This is a critical victory at a critical time,'' said Rep. Leon
Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the House Budget Committee. ``The
message is clear. We will not tolerate more tragic oil spills.''
   ``This is no less than a major victory for the environment,''
said Lisa Speer of the Natural Resources Defense Counsel, a private
environmental group, after the committee vote.
   President Bush earlier this year ordered the postponement of
lease sales off southern and northern California as well as off
southwestern Florida, pending an environmental review, but those
leases could be put out for bid early next year if Congress does not
intervene.

   Riot police fired tear gas and stormed
a university campus today to break up an anti-government rally of
thousands of radical students. At least 12 people were injured.
   About 3,000 riot troopers opened locked iron gates with cutters
and charged into Hanyang University in eastern Seoul. They had
locked the gates to keep more students from attending the rally.
   Riot police with shields and five armored vehicles fired hundreds
of tear gas shells over the hilly campus. They easily overpowered
and arrested hundreds of students who brandished steel bars, clubs
and firebombs to stop the police attack.
   There were no immediate reports on how many people were arrested.
Witnesses said at least 12 people were injured, including a female
student who fell from a 15-foot wall during earlier clashes around
the school gates.
   Many of the estimated 4,000 students at the protest fled into
school buildings or grappled over walls to nearby residential areas.
   Riot troopers smashed windows and charged into some school
buildings to pursue the students. They kicked and punched some of
them, tore down protest banners and smashed desks.
   Some protesters hurled rocks from the top of school building as
riot troopers raced down the school's roads with their arrested
colleagues.
   The students from Seoul and other cities said they want to march
to Pyongyang, the capital of communist North Korea, for an
international youth festival July 1-8.
   South Korea has banned participation in the festival, a sports
and cultural event mainly attended by non-aligned and communist
nations. Government officials have accused the north of using the
festival to stir up radical movements in South Korea.
   Newspapers in Seoul reported North Korea had opened its border
crossings to allow entry.
   However, about 6,000 riot police patrolled checkpoints leading to
the north, and 4,000 more fanned out at schools, intersections and
government buildings in downtown Seoul, according to police.
   In addition, U.S. troops guard the southern side of a joint
security area around the border truce village of Panmunjom.
   Pro-Western South Korea separated from North Korea at the end of
World War II.
   They fought the Korean War from 1950 to 1953. They are
technically still at war because no peace treaty was signed, and
more than 1 million heavily armed soldiers face each other across
the 150-mile border.
   About 43,000 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea under a
1954 mutual defense treaty.
   At today's rally, students placed one banner showing a man and
woman, clenched fists in the air, walking across mountains from
South to North Korea. Another banner showed small people with ropes
yanking a towering Uncle Sam to the ground.
   Radicals, a small but vocal minority, say President Roh Tae-woo
and the United States are keeping the Korean peninsula divided. They
demand the overthrow of Roh's government and the expulsion of U.S.
troops.

Will</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two sons of late Washington society hostess
Gwendolyn Cafritz have gone to court to contest a will that left the
bulk of her $84 million dollar estate to a charitable foundation
partly controlled by her attorney.
   The sons claim in papers filed in District of Columbia Superior
Court that former Secretary of State William P. Rogers influenced
their mother to leave them only ``family mementos.''
   Mrs. Cafritz died of cancer last November.
   Rogers was her personal attorney and the director of the Morris
and Gwendolyn Cafritz Foundation, a charitable trust that her
husband, real estate magnate Morris Cafritz, founded. Cafritz died
in 1964.
   The will granted three-fourths of the trust fund to the
foundation and the remaining one-fourth to the couple's three sons.
   Conrad Cafritz, 50, and Carter Cafritz, 52, filed the lawsuit,
naming their brother, Calvin, 58, as a defendant.
   Rogers told The Washington Post in a story in today's editions,
``There is no truth to the allegations in the complaint and no basis
for the lawsuit.''
   The lawsuit, filed June 21, describes Gwendolyn Cafritz as having
suffered from an unspecified mental and physical impairment during
the last 20 years of her life. It claims that Rogers and the
foundation's executive vice president Martin Atlas took advantage of
their business relationships with Mrs. Cafritz.
   The suit also names as defendants everyone else who got specific
bequests in the will, including two nephews, 11 grandchildren, the
former butler, housekeeper, personal maid, driver and two family
friends.
   Gwendolyn Cafritz became known during World War II and afterwards
as one of Washington's premier hostesses, entertaining presidents
and royalty at the mansion she and her husband owned. The will
leaves the building to the Cafritz Foundation to be used as a
conference center for ``scholars, statesmen and civic leaders.''

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Tom Bradley begins an unprecedented
fifth term today with an inaugural party supporters hope will
overshadow investigations of his ethics.
   Ten other newly elected city officials also were to be sworn in
on City's Hall south lawn.
   ``We are expecting a positive celebration,'' said mayor's
spokesman Bill Chandler.
   Among those expected to take part in the ceremony were City
Attorney James Hahn, who is conducting a criminal investigation to
determine if Bradley violated conflict-of-interest laws by accepting
at least $89,000 in fees from two financial institutions that did
business with the city.
   Others expected were newly elected City Council members Michael
Woo, Gloria Molina and Joan Milke Flores, who form the committee
monitoring Hahn's investigation.
   Bradley was not expected to mention the investigations during his
inaugural speech, Chandler said. ``The mayor will answer all the
questions once the inquiries are completed,'' he said.
   Bradley, 71, took office in 1973 when he unseated Sam Yorty.
   In April's non-partisan mayoral primary, Bradley defeated City
Councilman Nate Holden with 52 percent of the vote, just enough to
avoid a general election. Bradley has been expected to trounce
Holden, but was hurt by disclosures about his ties with banks that
do business with the city.
   Newspaper reports prompted the city attorney to launch a
conflict-of-interest investigation on March 31. The state Fair
Political Practices Commission later began its own probe.
   Soon, questions arose about whether Bradley had exchanged
political favors for preferential treatment at Drexel Burnham
Lambert, an investment banking firm.
   The U.S. Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange
Commission later opened additional investigations.
   Bradley told the City Council on May 10 that he had made ``an
error in judgment by engaging in outside employment,'' but insisted
he had done nothing illegal and would be vindicated.

<TEXT>
   A protester from the environmental group
Greenpeace boarded a Soviet nuclear submarine in the Baltic Sea and
planted a flag warning of radioactivity into a hole on a missile
launcher.
   Danish activist Klaus Iversen of Greenpeace carried out the
protest late Thursday from the group's vessel Moby Dick, which was
in international waters near the Soviet coast, said Greenpeace and
the Swedish news agency TT.
   The Moby Dick was near Riga to watch NATO sea maneuvers called
``Baltops 89'' when the protester placed a 3-by-5 foot yellow
warning flag with a black international symbol for radioactivity
into a hole of the missile launcher.
   The Soviet crew watched without intervening until Iversen and two
fellow activists in a dingy beside the sub left. Then a Soviet
crewman immediately took down the flag, which has three triangles
meeting in the middle.
   The nuclear-powered submarine carries four tubes for cruise
nuclear-tipped missiles.
   Greenpeace spokesman Magnus Furugard said the Soviet crew warily
watched the dinghies with binoculars.
   After the activists stopped next to the submarine, they waited
``to see how they reacted aboard,'' the spokesman said. ``As it is
war ships we are dealing with, we are very careful.''
   The crew ``appeared mainly curious,'' said Furugard.
   ``The crew did not intervene until after our activist was on his
way down from the sub and a sailor ran out to pull the banner
away,'' Furugard said.
   At least 15 NATO vessels were taking part in the naval exercise,
including the U.S. battleship Iowa and cruiser Ticonderoga, both
carrying nuclear weapons, according to Greenpeace.
   Ticonderoga is scheduled to visit Stockholm next week, and a
Greenpeace spokesman said the group will try to prevent its arrival.
   ``We hope the Swedish government will come to its senses,'' said
spokesman Jakob Lagercrantz said. He gave no details on the
Greenpeace plan.
   The government officially refuses to allow ships with nuclear
weapons in its waters, but it does not question visitors who decline
to say if such arms are on board.

<NOTE>Growth in U.S. Living Standards Lagged in 1988</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The growth in Americans' standard of living
lagged behind other major industrialized nations last year despite a
surge in U.S. export sales, according to a report.
   The report released Thursday, which was prepared by the Council
on Competitiveness, said the United States had failed to keep pace
with its major trading partners over the past 16 years, losing
additional ground in 1988.
   The findings came from the council's second annual
``competitiveness index,'' an effort to measure U.S. standing in the
world economy in terms that have meaning to the average American.
   The council tracks competitiveness in four areas _ living
standards, worker productivity, the U.S. share of the world export
market and American investment in education and non-defense research
and development.
   Those categories were chosen because of their relationship to
America's changing fortunes in the world economy.
   U.S. investment must keep pace with expenditures of other nations
to boost American productivity, a measure of output per hour of work.
   Rising productivity is needed to make American products
competitive on world markets, thus lowering America's huge trade
deficit and providing the income growth to boost American living
standards.
   While the council found that the growth in America's living
standard was lagging behind other countries, the United States still
had the second highest living standard. West Germany is first.

   Jim Wright, whose resignation from the
U.S. House takes effect today, thanked about 3,000 enthusiastic
supporters who greeted him at a homecoming bash and said he is
undecided about what he'll do next.
   ``I want to thank you for being broad-minded enough, tolerant
enough, big-spirited enough to tolerate my foibles, my
eccentricities and my mistakes occasionally,'' Wright said as the
crowd cheered Thursday night. ``And you let me do the big and
important things that helped all of us.''
   In his folksy speech, during which he stood, relaxed, with his
hands in his pockets, Wright said he would like to remain active as
a private citizen. He said he would like to work toward peace in
Latin America, and he added that talking with college students made
him happy.
   After the 15-minute speech at the hotel convention center, he
said he had yet to make any long-range plans.
   The former speaker never specifically mentioned the 69 alleged
violations of House ethics rules that prompted him to announce May
31 that he was resigning the House seat he held more than 34 years.
   But he blamed his troubles partly on reporters who he said were
too quick to write about rumors.
   When Julius Caesar rode his chariot through adoring crowds,
Wright said, a man continuously whispered in his ear, ``Remember,
Julius, you're only a man.''
   He continued: ``Thank goodness I don't need somebody to remind me
of that. Now, in our modern society, we have the newspapers to
remind us of that.''
   Afterward, Wright took off his coat and sat on the edge of the
stage, shaking hands, signing autographs and saying hello to old
friends.
   Smiling and pleased with his reception, he said he felt no
bitterness toward the media and his political opponents. ``Anyone
who carries a burden of bitterness does more harm to himself than
anyone else,'' he said.
   The Rev. Carol Ann Tatum of Fort Worth braved the crush in front
of the stage and emerged with autographs of Wright and his wife,
Betty, who sat beside him.
   ``I feel fantastic that other people feel the same way about him
that I do, and that's pure love,'' she said.
   Jack Adkison, a city councilman in the Fort Worth suburb of River
Oaks, said the gathering was ``a beautiful party but a sad
occasion.''

<HEAD>Churches Encouraging Members to Sign Domestic Partners Ballot Petition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Roman Catholic churches are helping a
minister and rabbi gather signatures for a petition drive to force a
referendum on the city's domestic partners ordinance.
   Though the petition is not officially sanctioned by Archbishop
John Quinn, some local Catholic churches have encouraged
parishioners to sign it after Sunday masses, church officials said.
   In their petition, the Rev. Charles McIlhenny of the First
Orthodox Presbyterian Church and Rabbi Lionel Feldman say the
domestic partners ordinance ``arbitrarily redefined the time-honored
and hallowed nature of the family, flying therewith in the face of
some of society's most precious values. It is only fair that the
issue ... should be submitted to all the voters.''
   The law _ enacted June 5 _ is intended to extend health benefits
to ``domestic partners'' of city workers. Under the law, live-in
lovers would be entitled to bereavement leave and hospital
visitation rights.
   The law defines domestic partners as any ``two people who have
chosen to share one another's lives in an intimate and committed
relationship.'' It is not binding on private businesses.
   The clergymen's petition is one of several on file at City Hall.
To get on the ballot, organizers must submit the signatures of
18,800 registered voters, Registrar Germaine Wong said Thursday.
   McIlhenny, whose ministry is not affiliated with the mainline
Presbyterian church, refused to comment Thursday. Feldman has been
unavailable for comment.
   Rita Semel, executive director of the Jewish Community Relations
Council, said Feldman does not run a synagogue. The local Board of
Rabbis has not taken a position on the ordinance, Semel said.
   Quinn has condemned the legislation as ``a profound attack on
marriage and the family.''
   Still, Deacon Norman Phillips, a spokesman for the archdiocese,
said Quinn ``hasn't put anything in writing as far as I know. But I
think it's logical to assume we're going to be in sympathy with it
because we were opposed to the legislation in the first place.''

<HEAD>Navy Apologizes to Sailor For USS Iowa News Leaks, Attorney Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy has apologized to a sailor for
falsely implicating him in the USS Iowa turret explosion that killed
47 seamen, the man's lawyer said.
   Two Naval Investigative Service agents apologized to Gunner's
Mate 3rd Class Kendall Truitt Wednesday for news leaks suggesting
Truitt was involved in the April 19 explosion, said Miami attorney
Ellis Rubin.
   ``We now demand that the Navy officially clear Mr. Truitt and
tell the public that he is not a homosexual nor was he involved in
any murder-suicide pact that resulted in the explosion,'' Rubin said
in a news release Thursday.
   Meanwhile, ABC News reported that the NIS admitted much of the
information it leaked to reporters was false, including a suggestion
that a homosexual relationship existed between Truitt and Gunner's
Mate Clayton Hartwig. Hartwig named Truitt sole beneficiary of his
$50,000 double-indemnity life insurance policy.
   Navy spokesmen in Norfolk, Va., and Mayport Naval Station said
they could not comment on the ABC report. They also said they had no
knowledge of the apology and the other information released by Rubin.
   ``The Navy investigation is still ongoing,'' said Lt. Larry
Thomas, a spokesman in Norfolk.
   Hartwig was killed at his position in the gun turret. Truitt, who
was in the turret's powder magazines five decks below, survived the
blast. Rubin said the Navy is looking at the possibility of a
suicide by Hartwig.
   ``There's no hard evidence that there was a suicide and we will
address that matter when we go to collect the insurance proceeds,''
Rubin said in a telephone interview from his Miami office.
   Rubin said the money was being withheld pending an outcome of the
Navy's investigation.
   ABC said the NIS also admitted its reports of finding a blasting
cap or timing device among Hartwig's belongings were false, and that
it wrongly characterized a booklet of practical jokes titled ``How
to Get Even Without Going to Jail'' as a ``volume detailing methods
of constructing booby traps and other deadly devices.''
   ABC also said it obtained copies of 17 letters from Hartwig which
appear to contradict the Navy's claim that Hartwig was despondent
and suicidal.
   Lt. Cmdr. Craig Quigley, a Navy spokesman in Washington, D.C.,
said the Navy's report on the accident has not yet been issued.
``The investigation continues and we are not in position to confirm
any information that ABC put in its piece tonight,'' he said.
   The apology by special agents came during a 3{-hour interview
with Truitt, Rubin said. ``They apologized for the initial press
release from the Navy and from NIS which grew into a national smear
of Mr. Truitt,'' the attorney said.
   Rubin said agents were interviewing Truitt's parents and friends
in Land O' Lakes and seeking to question Truitt's wife, Carole,
again. ``I have ordered no more interviews of my client. It's
getting to be harassment,'' Rubin said.
   The attorney said he and Truitt had been invited to testify in
July before the Senate Judiciary Committee. A subcommittee is
probing how information about the investigation was leaked to the
media.
   Shortly after the USS Iowa explosion, published reports said the
Navy was investigating the relationship between Truitt and Hartwig.
   Truitt has vehemently denied wrongdoing and said the Navy was
attempting to make him a scapegoat for the disaster.
   Earlier this month, Truitt was reassigned from the USS Iowa and
reported for duty at Mayport Naval Station, north of Jacksonville.

<HEAD>PLO Group Suspends Soldier Talks to Retaliate for Deportations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Syrian-based PLO faction said today that
it had suspended talks on handing over the remains of an Israeli
soldier in retaliation for Israel's deportation of eight
Palestinians.
   The Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine group also
accused Israel of deliberately killing a Palestinian identified as
the kidnapper of a U.S. relief worker abducted last week in the Gaza
Strip.
   In a statement, the Democratic Front said it ``deplores the
deportations, yet announces that such acts will not intimidate the
people of the intefadeh.''
   Israel has deported 55 Palestinians since the intefadeh, or
uprising, against Israel's military occupation of the occupied West
Bank and Gaza began in December 1987. The United Nations and United
States have condemned the deportations.
   The Israeli army said the eight Palestinians dropped off in south
Lebanon Thursday were leaders of the uprising and members of Fatah
or the Democratic Front.
   Fatah, the largest faction of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, is led by PLO chief Yasser Arafat. The Democratic
Front, the second largest, is based in Damascus, where it sent The
Associated Press in Cyprus a fascimile copy of its statement.
   The statement said Israel was responsible, by its actions, for
stopping talks about returning the body of an Israeli sergeant. It
gave no details about the negotiations.
   The soldier, a Druse in the Israeli ground forces, was captured
in April 1983 during Israel's invasion of Lebanon. The Democratic
Front says he was killed in an Israeli air strike on Rabbits' Island
off northern Lebanon.
   In a separate statement also received today, the Democratic Front
accused the Israel army of deliberately killing Mohammed Abu Al-Nasr.
   He had been identified as leader of a three-man group that
abducted Chris George, a 35-year-old co-director of the Jerusalem
office of the Save the Children Federation.
   George, of Montclair, N.J., was freed last week after 24 hours
when he agreed to carry a communique signed by Al-Nasr to President
Bush asking for recognition of Palestinian rights.
   Al-Nasr was killed Wednesday in the occupied Gaza. The army said
he was shot in an encounter with troops and that he had a pistol and
two clips of bullets.
   The Democratic Front's statement said: ``Israel deliberately
killed the Palestinian civilian Mohammed Abu Al-Nasr at one of the
Israeli army checkpoints.''
   The Democratic Front said Al-Nasr did not belong to their
faction. Israel accused the PLO of the kidnapping, but the PLO said
Al-Nasr was deranged and acted on his own.
   The Democratic Front said it joins PLO officials in denouncing
the kidnapping.

<DATELINE>CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal agents scoured the south
Texas coast after a fisherman found 5 kilograms of cocaine washed up
on the shore of Matagorda Island.
   Officials said a smuggling boat may have capsized during Tropical
Storm Allison early this week, dumping contraband into the water.
   ``We expect a large quantity of cocaine to wash ashore in the
next few days,'' Joe Flannery, agent in charge for the Drug
Enforcement Administration in Corpus Christi, said Thursday.
   The fisherman found the five bricks of cocaine near Port O'Connor
Wednesday.
   Coast Guard officials heightened their surveillance of the Gulf
of Mexico and Customs Service agents were scouting the beaches along
Matagorda Island, said Flannery.
   The fact that no boat was reported missing aroused suspicions, he
said.
   ``If a boat went down and nobody reported it, that indicates it
was some type of smuggling operation,'' Flannery said.

<TEXT>
   A new penny-a-pack cigarette tax to generate money
for the homeless is winning praise from advocates and criticism from
the tobacco industry, which says smokers shouldn't pay an undue
portion of social programs.
   The measure, which raises the city tax on cigarettes one cent to
16 cents a pack, is expected to provide $1.8 million annually to
city-funded homeless shelters.
   It takes effect at the end of July and won unanimous approval
Wednesday in the City Council.
   ``Because it is summertime, a lot of people forget about the
homeless because they say it's warm outside,'' said Alderman Luis V.
Gutierrez, who co-sponsored the measure. ``But this is the perfect
time to do this, so we have time to prepare for the winter.''
   An estimated 35 of the city's 53 shelters will benefit, said
Francis Tobin, housing organizer for the Chicago Coalition for the
Homeless, a non-profit advocacy group that lobbied heavily for the
measure.
   ``It will mean beds and food, but more importantly it will mean
support services in the shelters, like transportation to the welfare
office, to job interviews, and housing relocation assistance'' for
homeless people, Tobin said in a telephone interview Thursday.
   The city's homeless are estimated to number between 35,000 and
40,000. That number has increased from about 25,000 just a few years
ago due to a lack of affordable housing, Tobin said.
   The new tax will ``change the way that we look at the homeless''
and represents ``higher priority solutions rather than just a
Band-Aid approach,'' he said.
   A pack of cigarettes in Chicago now has a 61-cent tax: 15 cents
to the city, 10 cents to the county, 20 cents to the state and 16
cents to the federal government.
   That levy is one of the highest in the nation, and already forces
smokers in the city to pay ``more than their fair share,'' said Gary
Miller, a spokesman for The Tobacco Institute, a Washington,
D.C.-based group that represents U.S. tobacco companies.
   ``When it comes to public programs such as (Chicago's new
measure), the financial burden should be evenly spread across our
society,'' not just imposed on smokers, Miller said. He said he knew
of no other similar tax.
   Kerrie Wilson, a spokeswoman for the American Cancer Society,
said she was unaware of a measure like Chicago's. She said the
cancer society generally believes that increasing the cost of
cigarettes is a good way to help curb tobacco use, which has been
linked to causing some cancers.

<TEXT>
   Former House Speaker Jim Wright's son is pondering
the possibility of running for the House seat Wright is leaving
today.
   James Claude Wright III, 44, said Thursday he has been encouraged
to return to Fort Worth from the tiny northern New Mexico town of
Riconada to run for his father's vacated congressional seat.
   The younger Wright said said he has not discussed running for the
seat with his father, but doubts he would get much encouragement
because of the ethical furor that has surrounded his father in
recent months.
   ``I think he'd rather I didn't,'' he said.
   He said he didn't feel he could have run for office before, when
his father held one of the most powerful political posts in the
country.
   ``Nobody would take me serious in Texas while Dad was in
office,'' he said. ``They'd say, `That's Jim's son.' ''
   Now that the elder Wright is stepping away from politics, some of
his supporters are encouraging his son to take up the Democratic
banner.
   Others, however, have discouraged the move, the younger Wright
added.
   The elder Wright, 66, stepped down as House speaker after a
federal ethics probe stirred controversy in his office.
   The former speaker and his wife, Betty, were feted by Fort Worth
supporters Thursday night upon arriving in their hometown.
   The younger Wright said he would decide about his candidacy as
early as next week, after discussing the race with his wife, Sandra.
   Assistant Secretary of the State Brad Gahm said although the
younger Wright is not a Texas resident, he still could run for the
office if he establishes a Texas residence by Aug. 12.
   He has lived most of his life in Fort Worth, but moved to
northern New Mexico about eight years ago, working summers in the
rafting business and winters at ski lodges.
   He returned to Texas in 1984 and worked for the Texas Democratic
Party, but returned to New Mexico in 1985 to become an administrator
in the state personnel department.

   Miss America officials are exploring
moving the pageant from the Atlantic City Convention Center and
possibly out of New Jersey, the pageant's chairman says.
   ``The prospects for staying are excellent and there is no
immediate danger that the Miss America pageant is moving out of
Atlantic City,'' said Leonard C. Horn, pageant board chairman and
chief executive.
   ``But I'd be stupid if I just sat back and made assumptions like
we have for the last 50 years,'' he said. ``We're looking for ways
to cut down on our expenses.''
   Horn said the Convention Center has been unable to assure pageant
officials that the Miss America competition will have a home there
for at least the next 10 years, a commitment that pageant officials
are seeking.
   Howard Presina, executive director of the Convention Center
Authority, said he thinks the board will grant the pageant a
long-term lease. Presina said the center was making improvements
that would cut down on production costs.

   The co-pilot of an Airbus jetliner that

accident.
   Marie-Catherine Marchioni, an investigating magistrate, charged
co-pilot Pierre Mazieres, 46, on Thursday. In recent weeks, she has

   The Air France Airbus, one of the first of the new A-320 models,
crashed into a forest on June 26, 1988, while executing a low pass
during an air show at Habsheim, in eastern France. Three passengers
were killed and at least 50 others injured.
   After the accident, the pilot and co-pilot were suspended and Air
France issued regulations barring its airliners from such low-level

<HEAD>Reports say Japan's Embattled Prime Minister May Quit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANICE FUHRMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Embattled Prime Minister Sousuke Uno, dogged by a
sex scandal, may resign over his failure to rally support for his
party, news reports said today.
   A new poll published in the Mainichi Shimbun said Uno's Liberal
Democratic Party was likely to lose heavily in Sunday's Tokyo
Metropolitan Assembly election.
   It is the first major vote since Uno became prime minister less
than a month ago and a barometer of how the governing party will
fare in voting July 23 for half the seats in the upper house of
parliament.
   Party leaders had hoped that Uno would reverse their sagging
fortunes after he replaced Noboru Takeshita, who resigned June 2
over an influence-peddling scandal.
   However, the new poll mirrored other recent surveys showing the
governing party low in popularity. The party has been battered by
the scandal that drove out Takeshita, an unpopular new sales tax,
and now charges that Uno has been involved in extramarital affairs.
   On Wednesday, Uno denied news reports that he had threatened to
resign over the sex allegations, but today's press reports indicated
he faces a short tenure as premier and that Japan could have an
early national election.
   However, Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe said Uno will
represent Japan at a summit of seven leading industrial democracies
in Paris starting July 14.
   ``We keep having, every day, study sessions with Mr. Uno, and we
are confident that our government will be well represented at the
summit,'' Watanabe said.
   However, four national newspapers quoted Chief Cabinet Secretary
Masajuro Shiokawa as saying in a meeting Thursday with union leaders
that Uno's resignation and dissolution of the powerful lower house
of parliament ``might come before long.''
   The prime minister's office refused to comment on the reports,
saying the meeting was an off-the-record session.
   Dissolving the lower house would lead to national elections. Many
commentators say the Liberal Democrats, who have controlled the
government for 34 years, could lose.
   The Mainichi Shimbun said Uno's resignation could come between
Sunday's election and the parliamentary election scheduled for July
23. It said Uno could also be forced to resign if his party loses
its majority of the 252 upper house seats in July.
   Senior Liberal Democratic officials are considering a temporary
prime minister because a ``loss in the upper house election will be
obvious due to Uno's womanizing scandal,'' the paper said.
   In its poll, about 21 percent of the 1,600 eligible voters
questioned said they would vote Liberal Democratic candidates in the
Tokyo elections, while 17 percent said they would vote for the Japan
Socialist Party, the country's largest opposition party.
   However, 40 percent of voters polled June 23-25 said they were
undecided, and the rest of the voters supported smaller parties.
   The newspaper did not give a margin of error.
   In the last Tokyo election four years ago, the Liberal Demcrats
captured 36 percent of the vote, winning 63 of 127 seats in the
assembly, while 12 percent voted for the Socialist Party. The rest
of the votes went to three smaller opposition parties.
   The newspaper said a large number of women were breaking from the
Liberal Democrats. Women who said they would shift to the Socialists
jumped from 8 percent to 18 percent, while those who said they would
vote for Liberal Democrats shrank from 33 to 18 percent.
   Media reports have circulated since Uno's first week in office
that the married prime minister had affairs with geisha, highly
trained female entertainers, and other women. He reportedly gave
them money.
   After the latest reports, Uno said he was innocent and that he
had never acted ``contrary to morality.''
   Liberal Democratic candidates in Tokyo have not been inviting Uno
to stump for them.

<HEAD>Protein May Be Used in Treatment, Prevention of Breast Cancer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A natural protein produced in healthy
breast cells could be useful in determining likely breast cancer
victims and in treating the disease, a researcher says.
   The protein, mammastatin, already has been shown to stop the
growth of most types of breast cancer cells grown in the laboratory,
Dr. Max S. Wicha, a professor of internal medicine and director of
the University of Michigan Cancer Center, said Thursday.
   ``We speculate that women with low levels of mammastatin may be
more prone to develop breast cancer,'' Wicha said. ``If this is the
case, a scientist could potentially detect and correct a women's
predisposition to breast cancer before the disease occurs.''
   Wicha said he and fellow researchers discovered mammastatin three
years ago while searching for compounds that could block growth of
cancerous cells. They have succeeded in isolating and purifying
mammastatin, but not in quantities large enough to inject into
laboratory animals, he said.
   The researchers hope to use recombinant DNA technology to clone
the gene that produces mammastatin, Wicha said.
   They already have developed a blood test for mammastatin levels
but must spend the next several years testing women with and without
breast cancer to determine if there is a link between the protein
and the disease, he said.
   Mammastatin might inhibit breast cancer by shutting down breast
cell growth near the end of pregnancy, Wicha said. Researchers
believe production of the protein might account for a 50 percent
reduction in the risk of breast cancer among pregnant teen-agers,
whose breast tissue is still developing, he said.
   ``If the protective effects of pregnancy are due to mammastatin,
then one could potentially administer this agent to lower the risk
of developing breast cancer in women who have not been pregnant,''
he said.
   Mammastatin might be used in conjunction with chemotherapy to
kill cancerous cells more effectively than chemotherapy alone, Wicha
said.
   Wicha, research associate Paul Ervin and Drs. Mark Kaminski and
Robert Cody reported their findings in this week's issue of Science,
the university said.

<HEAD>Government Accuses UNITA Rebels of Breaking Cease-fire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUANDA, Angola (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Angolan government accused UNITA rebels
of breaking last week's cease-fire by ambushing a convoy, wounding
10 people, and sabotaging power lines bringing electricity to this
capital.
   In a statement issued late Thursday by the official ANGOP news
agency, the government said rebels staged attacks on electrical
stations that knocked out power in Luanda for two days.
   The statement also charged UNITA with ambushing a convoy of
civilian vehicles, wounding 10 members of a delegation from the
ruling Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA).
   Reports said the delegation was heading for Camacupa to explain
to local residents the peace process initiated by President Jose
Eduardo dos Santos and UNITA leader Jonas Savimibi on June 22 that
ended 14 years of civil war.
   The govenment statement described the attack on the powerlines as
``an act of terrorism ... constituting a flagrant violation of the
cease-fire.''
   The attack was on high-tension cables near Calomboloca Dam, 22
miles northeast of Luanda, the statement said. A hydroelectrical
plant there supplies energy to the capital.
   UNITA's Voice of the Black Cockerel radio station made no mention
of the alleged attacks.
   Meanwhile, ANGOP reported seven people perished when a mine blew
up under their vehicle Monday.
   The report said members of a medical team were among those killed
by the explosion near Huambo, 312 miles southeast of Luanda.
   It gave no further details.
   Official sources in Luanda said the cease-fire violations
indicated divisions within the rebel movement.
   Earlier Thursday, a statement by the MPLA politburo called on
government troops to respect the cease-fire, avoiding provocation
and only firing in self-defense.
   UNITA officials are meeting with a government delegation in Zaire
as part of the peace plan agreed by dos Santos and Savimbi.
   The plan calls for the rebels' re-integration into Angolan
society and the creation of a national reconciliation commission.
   Thursday's statement gave the Angolan people their first news of
the handshake agreement between dos Santos and Savimbi in Gbadolite,
Zaire, that sealed the peace agreement.
   UNITA _ the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola _
has fought to force the Luanda government to share power since
shortly after Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975.

   A 63-year-old woman stopped a mugging by
beaning an attacker on the head with a scrub bucket, and later said
she was only doing her ``civic duty.''
   Police say she went beyond duty, however, and plan to recommend
her for a citizen's commendation for coming to the aid of a younger
woman.
   Margie Searles said she took a bucket to scrub some paint from
the pavement in front of her son's house Thursday.
   ``When got out the door, I heard screaming,'' she said, ``and I
looked across the street and saw him pulling her hair.''
   Searles hit the alleged assailant, Ricardo Caban, 29, and he
walked away. Searles watched where he went, however, and waved down
a police car. Caban was charged with robbery and aggravated assault.
   The assailant's target, Annette Sinnott, 29, was treated for neck
and arm injuries and released from a hospital.
   ``Believe me, I have never had fear in my mind,'' Searles said.
``I just don't like to see any man beating up on a woman. This is my
instinct.''

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of Israelis with
military escorts hiked and rode in cars through the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip today to dramatize their claim to the
territories.
   Soldiers blocked one group from marching through an Arab village
because the hikers were not accompanied by soldiers, intended to
prevent clashes.
   Israel radio said about 2,000 people took part in the day of
hikes, most of which were in the West Bank. Critics said the marches
were a provocation to Palestinians residents and a burden on the
army.
   Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, head of the army's central command,
landed in a helicopter and ordered armed hikers of the anti-Arab
Kach Party from entering the village of Battir, near the West Bank
town of Bethlehem.
   ``This is a minority creating trouble,'' Mitzna told reporters
about a mile from the village. ``If we have to arrest them, we'll
arrest them. We won't let them go anywhere.''
   Mitzna said soldiers stopped the 20 members of the group, headed
by American-born Rabbi Meir Kahane, because they defied army orders
to hike only with military escorts.
   The Kach Party hikers _ armed with automatic rifles, pistols,
knives and clubs _ turned back when ordered to do so. They went back
toward Jerusalem, carrying Israeli flags and party banners, which
show a fist set in the Jewish Star of David.
   The Jewish settler movement Gush Emunim, or Bloc of the Faithful,
said there would be about 40 hikes to back the settlers' claim to
all the biblical land of Israel. However, several of the supposed
marches turned out to be trips in cars.
   Arab witnesses in Bani Naim, near the West Bank city of Hebron,
said about 15 car filled with Jewish settlers drove through Bani
Naim, along with seven carloads of soldiers, some firing in the air
to frighten away potential stone throwers.
   Another convoy of cars drove past Palestinian flags waving from
utility poles or wire on the way to an ancient Jewish cemetery in
Samua, about eight miles south of Hebron.
   Noam Arnon, spokesman for Gush Emunim, pointed to damage on the
synagogue, calling it an example of Arab ``terrorism.''
   A Palestinian teacher, who gave his name only as Mohammed, was
waiting to enter a mosque nearby. He said villagers resented the
intrusion by Jewish settlers on Friday, the Moslem holy day. ``Today
is our day for praying,'' he said.
   About 70,000 Jewish settlers live in the occupied lands, along
with about 1.7 million Palestinians.
   ``The Bible grew up in this land. All these places are linked to
the Bible, but we chose the places according to the landscape and
nature,'' said Yehuda Hazani, a Gush Emunim organizer.
   Brig. Gen. Ephraim Sneh, a legislator from the center-left Labor
party and former army commander, said on Israel radio that the hikes
would increase tensions between Arabs and Jews.
   ``In the context of the intefadeh (uprising), these are not
hikes. These are political protests,'' he said. ``When they increase
friction with the Arabs instead of reducing it, they have the most
negative value.''
   He said the hikes hinder army efforts to combat the uprising
against Israeli rule in the territories, which were seized from
neighboring Arab states in the 1967 Middle East War.
   In the past month, hikes by armed settlers have resulted in
clashes with Palestinians in which a 20-year-old Arab shepherd and a
15-year-old Palestinian girl were killed. Settlers are being
investigated as suspects in both slayings.
   The settlers have complained that the army has not done enough to
protect them against Palestinians throwing stones or firebombs
during the uprising. At least 538 Palestinians and 23 Israelis have
been killed since the uprising began in December 1987.
   In the Gaza Strip, PLO-backed activists declared a three-day
general strike to protest the deportation of eight Palestinians on
Thursday.
   Similar strikes were reported in the West Bank towns of Ramallah
and El Bireh, just north of Jerusalem.
   Israel said the Palestinians deported were leaders of the
uprising. They were sent to neighboring Lebanon.

   China today completed its purge of disgraced
former Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang, removing him from his last
government post for what senior leader Deng Xiaoping called
``serious mistakes.''
   Zhao, who sympathized with students seeking democratic reforms,
was ousted as vice chairman of the State Central Military Commission
by the Chinese legislature. Deng engineered Zhao's formal removal as
party leader last weekend.
   Deng wrote in a letter to the National People's Congress that
``since Comrade Zhao Ziyang has committed serious mistakes, I
proposed his dismissal,'' the official Xinhua News Agency said.
   President Yang Shangkun, who spent his career in the military,
was reportedly seeking Zhao's post of senior vice chairman, second
only to Deng in the military hierarchy. Yang has extensive contacts
among the military leadership, and he was a strong supporter of the
martial law decree announced by Premier Li Peng in May.
   Zhao fell out of favor with Deng last month for opposing martial
law and the crackdown on the student-led democracy movement.
   He was swept out of his posts with several other moderates, who
were replaced by officials backing the suppression of dissent. Zhao
was replaced as party general secretary by Jiang Zemin, a former
mayor of Shanghai who quickly put down protests in his own city.
   Zhao, 69, was last seen when he made a tearful speech to students
on a hunger strike in Beijing's Tiananmen Square on May 19.
   Martial law was imposed in Beijing the next day. On June 3-4, the
Chinese army swept into Tiananmen Square.
   Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong told Congress today that more than 200
civilians, including 36 college students, were killed. He also said
dozens of soldiers died, the official Xinhua news agency reported.
   Earlier, the government said 200 to 300 people, about half of
them soldiers, had died in the military crackdown. Chinese witnesses
and Western intelligence had estimated about 3,000 people were
killed.
   Chen also reported that 3,000 civilians were injured, in addition
to 6,000 soldiers and police.
   He said more than 1,000 army trucks, 60 armored cars, and 120
buses sustained $350 million in damages.
   The Congress opened its session Thursday, hailing the Communist
Party's violent suppression of the democracy movement as ``legal,
correct and necessary.''
   Today, China renewed attacks on foreign countries it said were
trying to isolate it for suppressing the movement.
   State media said Premier Li dismissed international criticism of
the crackdown.
   ``China has also noticed an anti-China ... current,'' Li told the
foreign minister of Sao Tome and Principe, an island nation off West
Africa. ``Under the banner of human rights, these people have made
unwarranted accusations of China for its quelling of the
counterrevolutionary rebellion and punishment of criminals according
to law.''
   President Yang told a visiting delegation from Bolivia on
Thursday that he hoped the world ``will understand that the
suppression of the rebellion represents a reasonable act in handling
our internal affairs,'' the state-run China Daily reported.
   ``No ruling party or government will allow the subversion of
itself,'' Yang said.
   The government also lashed out Thursday at the European Economic
Community for making ``presumptuous accusations'' against China.
   The 12-nation EEC on Tuesday condemned what it called the
``brutal repression taking place in China.'' It called for an
embargo on arms sales and urged the World Bank to postpone new loans.
   The United States, Canada, Japan, Australia and other countries
have already taken similar steps against Beijing.
   In Washington, the U.S. House of Representatives voted 418-0
Thursday to endorse the cutoff of military aid already ordered by
President Bush. But it also voted to suspend trade and development
programs, ban the sale of police equipment and limit transfer of
high-technology and nuclear materials.
   The House provision is part of a foreign aid bill that the Senate
still must consider.
   China has faced increasing isolation within the international
community as authorities continue to arrest people who supported the
mass protests for greater political freedom that began in mid-April.
   Since the military crackdown, at least 1,800 people have been
arrested and 27 executed.

applications opened, more than 1,000 people called seeking to get
aboard the first joint Soviet-British space mission.
   ``All the lines are being used virtually all the time,'' said
Nigel Barstow, telephone supervisor for a recruitment agency, MSL
International.
   Under an agreement signed in Moscow on Thursday, Britain's first
astronaut will accompany two cosmonauts to the Soviet orbiting
station Mir in 1991.
   A cartoon in London's Today newspaper showed Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher, looking outraged, floating in space in a pressure
suit. ``I know you didn't apply, comrade prime minister,'' a Soviet
cosmonaut is saying. ``Thirty million of your countrymen nominated
you.''
   Those who do apply must be between 21 and 40 years old, have
scientific training, proven ability to learn a foreign language and
a knack for getting along with foreigners.
   Early callers included a physicist, an ex-pilot and an
18-year-old schoolboy who was rejected immediately as too young.
   The project, pairing the Soviet space agency Glavkosmos and a
British consortium, will be the first manned space flight financed
entirely by the private sector.
   The British consortium is trying to raise $25 million to cover
the British astronaut's costs.
   The project was named for Juno, the Roman goddess of marriage,
because it marks ``the start of a very special relationship between
Glavkosmos and the British space administration,'' organizers said.

<HEAD>Shevardnadze Unanimously Confirmed as Foreign Minister</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New thruout with legislature approving two other nominations.
No pickup.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze won
unanimous confirmation in his job today from the new Soviet
legislature. He was the first Cabinet member to win approval without
questioning from the Supreme Soviet.
   There was no discussion on the Shevardnadze vote, but
confirmation of the nominee for the State Foreign Economic
Commission was postponed after he failed to win a required majority
of the 542-seat legislature, possibly because of high absenteeism.
All the lawmakers were present to raise their hands in support of
Shevardnadze.
   Shevardnadze went to the podium and waited for questions about
his stewardship of the country's foreign policy, but nobody said a
word.
   ``The candidate's authority among parliamentarians is so high
that the decision was made without any consideration of the
candidate's program,'' the official Tass news agency said.
   Shevardnadze and other ministers were reportedly questioned in
closed committee hearings last week as the legislature for the first
time exercised veto power over top government officials and forced
the withdrawal of seven nominees.
   The popular foreign minister has helped produce a nuclear arms
limitation treaty, the withdrawal of Red Army troops from
Afghanistan and vastly improved relations with neighbors like China
and Iran.
   Confirmation of Vladimir Kamentsev as a deputy premier and head
of the State Foreign Economic Commission was postponed after he
failed to win a majority, Tass said. The vote was 246 for, 97
against, with 56 abstentions.
   Only 438 legislators signed in for the session and many were
outside the hall when the vote on Kamentsev was taken.
   ``By law, a Cabinet nominee is to earn at least 272 votes to be
endorsed,'' Tass said. It said another vote would be taken at a
later date.
   Kamentsev was accused of being incompetent because he has been in
charge of the Soviet Union's foreign economic activities for two
years, during which foreign trade has decreased.
   Deputies complained he had no clear strategy for increasing the
country's commercial dealings with the rest of the world and for
dealing with what some have called virtual isolation from the world
economy.
   The legislature was also considering the nomination of Vitaly
Doguzhiev to head a newly created Commission on Emergencies to
coordinate reaction to disasters like the Armenian earthquake and
the recent explosion of leaking gas in Central Asia that engulfed
two trains and killed 600 people, Tass said.
   Doguzhiev had been minister of general machine-building.
   Before recessing until Monday, the Supreme Soviet also approved
the nominations of Nikolai Laverov to be a deputy premier in charge
of science and technology and Mikhail Shkabardnya to be the
Cabinet's business manager.

<TEXT>
   The government's securities fraud probe of
one-time whiz-kid corporate raider Paul A. Bilzerian has snared
billionaire shopping center and sports magnate Edward J. DeBartolo
Sr.
   In a sweeping Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit,
DeBartolo, Bilzerian and three others were charged Thursday with
concealing investments to mask planned takeovers, manipulating stock
prices or trading on inside information in seven deals from 1985
through 1988.
   The suit seeks to recover more than $34 million in illegal
profits, making it one of the largest civil cases ever involving
corporate takeovers.
   The 70-year-old DeBartolo _ the nation's largest developer of
shopping malls _ and an associate agreed to pay more than $3 million
to settle the charges with the SEC, without admitting guilt.
   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C.,
seeks $31.3 million in allegedly fraudulent profits from Bilzerian,
who already faces a lengthy prison term and fines for a criminal
fraud conviction June 9.
   The suit also details for the first time alleged illegal stock
transactions in Bilzerian's $1.06 billion takeover last year of
Singer Co., the sewing machine company turned defense contractor.
Later Thursday, Bilzerian resigned as chairman and chief executive
of Singer.
   ``In numerous situations he engaged in the same kinds of
violations time and time again of the disclosure requirements,''
said SEC Associate Enforcement Director William McLucas.
   Bilzerian's lawyer, Arthur F. Mathews, said his client would
fight the charges in court.
   The suit alleges Bilzerian lied about or failed to properly
disclose to the SEC in October 1987 the source of at least $8
million in borrowed money he used to buy Singer stock. It maintains
Bilzerian later borrowed another $6 million in a Singer stock sale
agreement he never disclosed.
   Bilzerian also was charged with disclosure violations in
connection with stock purchases in Pay 'N Pak Stores Inc. and
Fortune Financial Group Inc.
   The lawsuit also alleges Bilzerian violated financial disclosure
requirements or attempted to conceal stock ownership involving
Cluett, Peabody &amp; Co., Hammermill Paper Co. and H.H. Robertson Co.,
and a stock transaction in Armco Inc., in 1985 and 1986.
   Those four transactions formed the basis of Bilzerian's criminal
conviction, which was an indirect spinoff from the Ivan Boesky
insider trading case.
   DeBartolo agreed to pay about $2.7 million in alleged illegal
profits to settle charges involving the Cluett and Hammermill
takeovers. DeBartolo owns the National Hockey League's Pittsburgh
Penguins and the National Football League's San Francisco 49ers and
has a net worth of $1.4 billion, according to Forbes magazine.
   His company, the Youngstown, Ohio-based Edward J. DeBartolo Sr.
Corp., was not charged.
   William D. Moses, the company's senior vice president for
operations, and Richard S. Sokolov, its general counsel, were
charged with helping Bilzerian misrepresent the source of funds and
with entering into an undisclosed transaction in one deal.
   Moses also was charged with one insider trading count. He agreed
to pay $205,000 in alleged illegal profits and $129,000 in fines.
Sokolov was not required to pay any amount as part of his settlement
with the SEC.
   ``The settlement was entered into in order to avoid protracted
litigation and to permit DeBartolo, Moses and Sokolov to devote full
attention to their business affairs,'' a company statement said.
   The fifth defendant in the case, who has not settled, is David A.
Tallant, a California lawyer who managed some Bilzerian trusts.
   A federal jury in Manhattan found Bilzerian, 39, of Tampa, Fla.,
guilty of nine felony counts of violating securities and tax laws
during four transactions. He faces up to five years in jail and
$250,000 in fines on each criminal count and is appealing the
conviction.

<HEAD>Architect of Japanese-American Internment Dead at 81</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Karl R. Bendetsen, one of the chief architects
of the government's internment of Japanese-Americans in World War
II, died at his home after a heart attack. He was 81.
   Bendetsen, a retired president and chairman of the board of
Champion International Corp. of Stamford, Conn., and undersecretary
of the Army in the 1950s, died Wednesday.
   Bendetsen, then a major in the Army provost marshal general's
office, was assigned in 1942 as a liaison officer between the
Justice Department and the Western Defense Command, after officials
decided that Japanese-Americans represented a potential threat to
national security during World War II.
   He devised a system that divided the West Coast into prohibited
military zones. He also designed a complex system of passes and
permits for Japanese immigrants that the Justice Department and the
FBI refused to oversee because of a lack of manpower. That gave
supervision of Japanese immigrants, and later Americans of Japanese
ancestry, to the Army, whcih subsequently ordered their internment.
   Bendetsen's military decorations included the Silver Star, three
Bronze Stars, three Legions of Merit and a Distinguished Service
Medal. He was also the recipient of the Medal of Freedom, the
nation's highest civilian award.
   After the war, Bendetsen resumed his San Francisco law practice.
He was appointed assistant secretary of the Army in 1950 and
undersecretary in 1952.
   He became chairman, president and chief executive officer of
Champion Papers, a forest products company, in 1965 and retired in
1972.
   From 1980 to 1984, he served as a member of a presidentially
appointed commission to study the Strategic Defense Initiative, also
known as the Star Wars anti-missile program.
   Bendetsen is survived by his wife, Gladys Ponton de Arce
Heutematte Bendetsen, a son and a daughter. Two previous marriages
ended in divorce.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Issues Stay In Age Discrimination Case of Supreme Court
Justice</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER GRAFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supreme Court Justice Louis Peck can
remain on the bench for at least 10 more days, as lawyers battle
over whether the justice should be forced to retire because of his
age.
   U.S. District Court Judge Lee Gagliardi issued a temporary
restraining order on Thursday, stopping the state from forcing Peck
off the bench today.
   The state had issued the June 30 retirement order because Peck
turned 70 in December and the state Constitution requires all judges
to retire at age 70. Peck is fighting the order, saying federal law
prohibiting age discrimination supersedes the state constitutional
provision.
   Gagliardi's order allows Peck to remain on the job for 10 days,
but lawyers on both sides said the order could be extended if there
is no decision within that period.
   ``The understanding is that the judge will renew the restraining
order until there is a decision in the case,'' said James Lee, the
New York regional attorney for the federal Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission. ``This will allow Justice Peck to stay in
office while the case is argued.''
   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is handling the case
on Peck's behalf. The commission believes the action to force Peck's
retirement constitutes age discrimination.
   Peck said he was pleased by the order and is looking forward to
getting a decision. ``This settles whether I have to move out this
weekend, but the case has a long way to go,'' the justice said.
   The legal question is whether a federal law concerning age
discrimination should be applied to appointed state judges.
   In 1986, Congress amended the federal Age Discrimination in
Employment Act to extend protections to people of all ages.
Previously the act had covered people only up to age 70.
   The federal law, however, does contain exceptions: elected
officers, the personal staff of elected officers and policymaking
appointees. Courts in Massachusetts have ruled that appointed state
judges like Peck also should be excluded.

   A soldier was shot and killed near a
Manila military camp today, police said.
   His death brings to eight the number of policemen and soldiers
gunned down in daylight ambushes on the capital's streets during the
last seven days.
   Police have blamed most killings on communist assassins. But
investigators in Manila's Taguig suburb said they have not
determined who shot Tech. Sgt. Semporiano Gepayo.
   Gepayo was driving to work in his jeep when three men armed with
.38-caliber pistols ambushed him about a mile from the
constabulary's Capital Command headquarters, police said.
   Capt. Jaime Talampas of Taguig police said the gunmen escaped in
a pedicab after grabbing their victim's .45-caliber pistol.
   Police could not say the killers were communists because they
were armed with .38-caliber weapons, Talampas said. The rebels
prefer .45-caliber weapons for assassinations, he said.
   Last week, Brig. Gen. Alexander Aguirre said rebels have killed
at least 55 policemen, soldiers and neighborhood officials in the
Manila area since January.
   Rebels want to set up a communist state in the Philippines.

<HEAD>Governor: Protect Crime Victims But Keep Records Open</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislators should amend a recent law and
make information on crime victims available to the public but bar
companies trying to sell security systems from using the
information, Gov. Bill Clements said.
   ``We will not stand by and allow Texans to be preyed upon by
criminals and unscrupulous business practices,'' the governor said
in a news release Thursday. He said he was adding the law to the
agenda for the special legislative session, which began last week.
   Clements urged legislators to amend the law to make information
on crime victims available to the public and media, rather than
repeal it outright. Penalties should be established for people or
businesses that use crime victim information for commercial profit,
he said.
   ``Allowing the Texas Open Records Act to become the Texas Closed
Records Act is inexcusable,'' Clements said. ``Clearly, the Texas
media has a right, indeed an obligation, to fully and accurately
inform the people of Texas.''
   Action on the amendment proposal is not expected until next week
at the earliest.
   The new law, believed to be the first of its kind in the nation,
allows government agencies including police and fire departments to
withhold the names, addresses and other identifying information of
felony crime victims. The law has angered news organizations and
confused police.
   News organizations throughout Texas have been unable to get
routine crime information, such as the names of people killed in
drunken driving accidents.
   State lawmakers had asked Clements to put the issue on the
special session agenda. They said the law was intended to shield
crime victims from sales pitches by security and alarm companies but
has been misinterpreted and misapplied.
   The bill's author, Rep. Fred Blair, earlier Thursday said he
wanted to repeal the law ``because of what is going on now and
because of the future misapplication of the bill.''
   Sen. Kent Caperton, a frequent sponsor of open-records
legislation, said the bill ``just slipped through'' without
opposition during the regular legislative session, which ended May
29.
   Clements signed the measure June 14. He said later that he hadn't
thought it would put crime victim information ``in seclusion.''

   Former President Andrei A. Gromyko recently
underwent surgery to correct a vascular problem and is hospitalized
in satisfactory condition, a government spokesman said today.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh confirmed rumors that
Gromyko is ill, but he refused to disclose the nature of the illness
or say where the 79-year-old statesman is being treated.
   ``Considering the character of the illness and the age of the
patient, his condition is satisfactory,'' he said in response to a
question at a regular news briefing.
   ``He underwent a surgical procedure and is now undergoing
treatment,'' the spokesman said.
   Gromyko was Soviet foreign minister for 26 years before being
appointed to the largely ceremonial post of president in July 1985.
   He served as Soviet ambassador to the United States in 1943 and
in 1946 was appointed representative to the United Nations.
   Gromyko resigned the presidency and his Politburo position in
September. Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Communist Party general
secretary, took on the presidency to replace Gromyko in a political
reform that gave the job more power.
   In April, Gromyko was retired as a member of the policy-making
Central Committee along with dozens of other senior officials, to
make way for new blood in the leadership.

   Mayor James Jernigan has blocked the city
council's plan to fly an American flag upside down on July Fourth,
saying it was not an appropriate protest of the U.S. Supreme Court
decision on flag burning.
   The council had voted unanimously to invert the flag to protest
the decision that flag burning is constitutionally protected as
freedom of speech.
   The council's decision had sparked protest in this western
Georgia city, with lawyer Seth Harp threatening to go to court to
stop it and other residents threatening to right the flag themselves.
   The situation got out of hand, Jernigan said Thursday. He used a
little-known city code that allows the mayor to send resolutions
back to the council.
   ``In a sense we are backing down. It is in the best interest of
the community,'' he said.
   The U.S. Flag Code says an inverted flag is a distress signal
indicating severe threat to life or property.

   The National Right to Life Committee
opened its three-day convention without a Supreme Court ruling on
abortion, but leaders said the decision won't affect their efforts.
   ``We just simply will have to wait until the baby's born,'' the
committee's general counsel, James Bopp Jr., told the convention's
opening session Thursday at the Radisson South hotel.
   Mary Schmit, co-director of Minnesota Citizens Concerned For
Life, said that, regardless of the Supreme Court decision, ``our
work will be more challenging than ever.''
   The challenge, she said, ``is not to rest until all of the
anti-life laws are erased from the books.''
   ``Our role is to be a little thorn in the side. Being a thorn in
the side doesn't always make the body politic very happy,'' said
Wanda Franz, the National Right to Life Committee vice president.
   The convention's first day included picketing by about 150
supporters of legalized abortion. But no major confrontations
between the opposing sides occurred.
   The Supreme Court's ruling in the Missouri case Webster vs.
Reproductive Health Services had been expected Thursday, but was
delayed until at least Monday.
   The law in question restricts the availability of abortions and
defines life as beginning at conception. The case went to the
Supreme Court after the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals struck
down the law in July, saying it conflicted with the high court's
1973 Roe vs. Wade decision, which legalized abortions.
   About 1,500 people were registered for the convention, which
continues through Saturday.
   One of the registrants was Bill Baird of Hempstead, N.Y., who
said he has attended the annual meeting for the last 16 years to
represent the opposition viewpoint.
   ``I have learned after 26 years of fighting for reproductive
freedom to never give up, never surrender. Freedom is not free,''
said Baird, a longtime activist for abortion rights who runs three
abortion-counseling clinics in New York and Massachusetts.
   Baird's presence was ignored by most of the convention delegates,
but one man confiscated the materials his assistant was handing out.
   About 15 demonstrators also stood on the grass alongside the
driveway entrance to the hotel, holding up large signs to express
their views supporting legalized abortion issue as people drove into
the parking lot.
   ``All we're doing is basically just providing a pro-choice
presence,'' said Gloria Totten, education coordinator for the
Abortion Rights Council in Minnesota. ``We respect (the abortion
opponents') right to be here and we would never do anything
confrontational. We just wanted to show a presence.''
   Bopp emphasized that the committee condones only lawful
activities in its fight to overturn laws allowing abortion.
   ``We do not support unlawful activities,'' he said. ``If those
unlawful acts (by other demonstrators) are violent, we condemn
them.''
   President Bush greeted the conventioneers in a video message,
expressing his hope that the Supreme Court decision in the Missouri
case will favor their position.
   ``While the court has yet to decide, I hope the justices will
give the democratic representatives of the people, the state
legislatures and the Congress the power to restore legal protection
to the unborn,'' Bush said. ``We may not prevail today or tomorrow,
but make no mistake about it, we will prevail.''

   President Bush, using the statue of the
nation's most famous flag-raising scene as a backdrop, today urged
passage and ratification of a ``simple, stark and to-the-point''
constitutional amendment to ban flag burning.
   The president spoke before a hastily assembled crowd at a
ceremony at the Iwo Jima Memorial, the statue of five Marines
raising the flag on a Pacific island during World War II.
   Bush used the ceremony to register his support for a
Republican-drafted proposed amendment that asserts: ``The Congress
and the states shall have power to prohibit the physical desecration
of the flag of the United States.''
   ``This flag is one of our most powerful ideas,'' Bush declared.
``If it is not defended, it is defamed...it represents the fabric of
our nation.''
   Bush said the statue behind him, a huge bronze casting of a
photograph by Associated Press photographer Joe Rosenthal, was
``stunning...even now it humbles us, inspires us.''
   Bush said that the amendment drafted by Republican congressional
leaders with the support of some Democrats was ``simple, stark and
to-the-point.''
   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas praised Bush for
supporting the amendment and called it ``a serious step'' to
circumvent last week's 5-4 Supreme Court ruling that said flag
burning is a form of free expression protected by the Constitution.
   Dole said that people across the nation were speaking out against
the ruling. ``People are saying, keep your hands off Old Glory,'' he
said.
   Also speaking at the ceremony were co-sponsors of the amendment,
House Republican leader Robert Michel of Illinois and two Democrats,
Sen. Alan Dixon of Illinois and Rep. Sonny Montgomery of Mississippi.
   Both Democrats and Republicans have publicly deplored the Supreme
Court decision, but a spokesman for the Democratic National
Committee accused Bush of using the issue for political opportunism.
   ``He's running for president instead of being president,'' Mike
McCurry, DNC communications director, said Wednesday. ``The heroes
of Iwo Jima didn't die so they could become a backdrop for some
political photo opportunity.''
   Bush used the flag ceaselessly in his presidential campaign last
year. He visited a flag factory and attacked Democrat Michael
Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor, for vetoing as unconstitutional
a bill requiring the Pledge of Allegiance to be recited in schools.
   House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., introduced the
resolution Thursday before the House adjourned for its holiday
recess.
   Michel said he expects Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of
Kansas to introduce it there when that chamber returns from its
extended Fourth of July holiday, which began last week.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said Thursday the House
Judiciary Committee will begin hearings on the flag issue in July.
   Foley, while condemning flag burning, has urged caution about
amending the Constitution. Michel said he generally agrees, but
believes such action is the only answer in this case.
   ``I just have to assume we're not going to be thwarted,'' he
said, insisting he did not view the issue as a Republican attempt to
paint the Democrats as less patriotic.
   Democratic Rep. Sonny Montgomery of Mississippi joined Michel in
introducing the resolution.
   Michel said the amendment avoids specific methods of desecration
because any list might leave one out. He pointed out, however, that
the amendment referred only to physical desecration in order to
avoid hampering free expression.

   The wait for the Supreme Court's latest word on
abortion rights will last through the weekend.
   The court prolonged the drama surrounding its most closely
watched case of the 1980s by postponing until Monday any word in an
abortion dispute from Missouri.
   In it, the justices are being asked to reverse the court's 1973
decision legalizing abortion.
   Scores of partisans who had gathered on the court building's
front steps voiced disappointment Thursday.
   Olivia Gans of the National Right to Life Committee said, ``It is
difficult to wait ... but we remain optimistic.''
   Faye Wattleton, president of Planned Parenthood, said further
delay would be ``an indication of the turmoil that this court is
willing to create in this country.''
   Randall Terry, national director of an anti-abortion group called
Operation Rescue, said, ``If I was a Supreme Court justice, I would
throw the decision off the airplane as I was leaving the country.''
   Before beginning its three-month summer recess, the court must
deal with three cases awaiting decision.
   In each, the court must announce a decision or order the case
reargued. If it chooses the latter course, a new round of arguments
would be held during the court term that begins in October, with
announcement of a decision likely in 1990.
   Court officials refused all comment on the prospect of a Monday
decision in the Missouri case, which is called Webster vs.
Reproductive Health Services. And in the absence of any hard facts,
rumors abounded.
   ABC News reported that Justice Harry A. Blackmun, who wrote the
court's 1973 decision, may have asked Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist for more time to complete ``a bitter opinion'' in the
Webster case.
   However, a Supreme Court source who spoke only on condition on
anonymity told The Associated Press today that Blackmun's ``writing
is not holding things up.''
   Abortion-rights advocates fear the court will order the Missouri
case reargued next term and do so in a way that signals the justices
are contemplating a major retreat from the 1973 ruling in Roe vs.
Wade.
   In that decision, the court said women have a constitutional
right to abortion.
   If reargument is ordered, the court also could agree to review up
to three other abortion disputes pending before the justices. That
would be read by some as a tip-off the court was on the verge of a
sweeping ruling.
   The three cases _ from Illinois, Ohio and Minnesota _ all involve
state regulations making abortions harder to get.
   The justices met behind closed doors in a regularly scheduled
conference Thursday after their public session.
   Attorney General William Webster said Thursday in Jefferson City,
Mo., he was not reading anything into the delay. Webster, who argued
in favor of upholding the Missouri law, said, ``Hope springs
eternal. Anybody who wants it to come to a certain way can write
into this delay great optimism.''
   Roe vs. Wade itself was a case that had to be argued twice before
a decision was announced. The court hears arguments in about 150
cases each term, and since 1977 has held over at least one case each
year for reargument the following term.
   The 1973 ruling said a woman's decision to have an abortion
during the first three months of pregnancy must be left to her and
her doctor. It said states may regulate abortions during the second
trimester only to protect the woman's health, and may take steps to
protect fetal life in the third trimester.
   State authority to regulate abortions after the first trimester
was not made absolute, however.
   In the past decade, about 1.5 million legal abortions have been
performed each year.
   If Roe vs. Wade were reversed, states would be free to
stringently regulate _ or even outlaw _ abortion.
   In the two decisions the court did announce Thursday, it:
   _Gave public officials more authority to ban advertising and
sales pitches _ including ``Tupperware parties'' in college
dormitories. The 6-3 ruling in a New York case significantly limited
commercial free speech.
   _Limited, in a case from Washington state, the power of Indian
tribes to control, through tribal zoning laws, the use of land owned
by non-Indians within a reservation's boundaries.
   The two other cases in which decisions are pending include an
important church-state dispute from Pittsburgh focusing on holiday
displays of a Christmas Nativity scene and a Hanukkah menorah at
government buildings.
   The court also is expected to decide in a case from Arkansas and
Florida whether a business that successfully challenges a state tax
as unconstitutional is entitled to be refunded the money it paid
before the tax was invalidated.

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said today it has frozen
more than $110 million in development aid to China because of the
recent ``bloody events'' there.
   The federal government also has ordered all its aid experts and
advisers in China to return home and canceled travel to the country
by its economic development personnel, said Hans-Peter Repnik, the
second-ranking official of the Ministry for Economic Cooperation.
   ``In view of the bloody events in China, we have indefinitely
frozen all current (development) contacts at the highest political
levels,'' he told a news conference.
   Repnik said signing of a protocol negotiated for future
development aid and a newly approved development grant of $110
million have been stopped.
   China has received $145 million in grants from West Germany since
1982, he said.
   In addition, work had started on 125 development aid projects
which already have cost West Germany $220 million under a 1985
agreement, Repnik said. Support for the projects is now frozen
except where it is to the advantage of the Chinese people to
continue them, Repnik said without elaborating.
   He said that because of the ``still unclear situation in China,''
Chinese students and delegations in West Germany who fear problems
if they return home will be permitted to remain in this country.
   At least 27 people have been executed in China following the
crackdown on a pro-democracy movement. The military crushed the
movement June 3-4. The government said 200 to 300 people were killed
in the crackdown, many of them soldiers.
   Chinese witnesses and Western sources said the death toll could
be as high as 3,000.

   Syrian and Christian forces fought
sporadic artillery duels in Beirut today, killing two people, police
said.
   Syrian gunners deployed in Moslem west Beirut concentrated their
shelling on the coastline north of the city to maintain a blockade
of the Christian enclave, a police spokesman said.
   Gunners of Christian Gen. Michel Aoun responded by firing at
Syrian army batteries along west Beirut's seaside boulevard, said
the spokesman, who customarily is not identified by name.
   Aoun's command accused the Syrians of violating an Arab League
call for a cease-fire and said in a statement the Christian gunners
``only responded by shelling the sources of fire.''
   Syrian soldiers have maintained a daily barrage of the Christian
coastline despite a truce called May 26 by Arab leaders.
   Police said early today that four people were wounded in the
latest clashes, but they said two of them later died.
   By police count, 382 people have been killed and 1,499 wounded in
the 15-week confrontation that began when Aoun's army troops
blockaded illegal ports run by Syrian-backed militias.
   Arab leaders have asked King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, King Hassan II
of Morocco and President Chadli Bendjedid of Algeria to find a
settlement to Lebanon's 14-year civil war by November.
   The three met in the Algerian town of Oran on Tuesday and renewed
the call for a cease-fire.
   They also invited Lebanese legislators to meet outside Lebanon to
negotiate a new power-sharing formula between the Christians, who
traditionally have dominated Lebanese politics, and Moslems, who
outnumber them more than 2-1.
   Beirut's independent An-Nahar newspaper today published Aoun's
first comment on the call.
   ``I welcome the Oran statement and await its implementation,'' it
quoted him as saying.
   Asked to comment on the proposal that lawmakers meet in a foreign
country, Aoun said: ``The deputies are free to take whatever
decisions they want.'' Previously, aides said he opposed the idea of
legislators meeting in another country.
   Also today, a clandestine group warned Cyprus not to give severe
penalties to six Lebanese charged with plotting to assassinate Aoun.
   ``We believe it is highly unlikely that the Cypriot court trying
our strugglers will take a biased attitude and issue severe
sentences, but if it does then we shall be compelled to deal with
the Republic of Cyprus as an adverse party in the current conflict
in Lebanon,'' a spokesman for the March 14 Organization, identified
only as Zafer, told The Associated Press.
   The group claimed responsibility June 2 for plotting to shoot
down a helicopter carrying Aoun at Larnaca's airport in Cyprus.
   Zafer, wearing a black mask and black glasses, spoke to the AP at
an underground bunker in west Beirut. He said the group sent a
letter to the Cypriot government outlining its position.
   The director general of the interior ministry, Charalambos
Hajipanayiotou, confirmed that it recieved a letter from the
organization and did not respond.
   The letter ``in effect asked us to let the six Lebanese go,'' he
said.
   The prosecution announced today it will ask the Cyprus court to
skip a preliminary hearing and proceed directly to trial.

   Divers braving rough seas searched this
morning for three crewmen missing after an oil-drilling vessel
capsized in the Gulf of Mexico, but they were unable to enter the
ship and got no response when they tapped on the hull, officials
said.
   A fourth man on a fishing vessel helping in the search fell
overboard and also is missing, said Lt. Don Merwin with the U.S.
Coast Guard in Galveston.
   Six workers from the vessel Titan, containing a jack-up rig, were
rescued late Thursday by Coast Guard helicopter and boat crews. They
suffered minor injuries.
   ``There's no change; the missing men haven't been located and the
search still continues,'' said Coast Guard Petty Officer Matt Walter
said this morning.
   The civilian diving crew was delayed for a time while awaiting
the arrival of another vessel to help secure the overturned rig,
which was considered unstable amid 20 mph winds and 5- to 7-foot
seas, officials said.
   ``The divers did go down, so evidently they felt it was secure
enough,'' Petty Officer Ron Chadwick said later. ``But they were
unable to get inside the vessel. They tapped on the hull, and there
was a negative response at this time.'' Chadwick was unsure what
further measures were being taken at the site at midmorning.
   The three missing workers are believed trapped within the
drilling equipment.
   ``They may be trapped in the interior of the jack-up rig,''
Merwin said. ``There's a possibility that it caught an air bubble.
If they did, there's a possibility that they're still alive. We're
proceeding on that assumption.''
   Walter said the drilling vessel, also called a spud boat, has
legs that can be jacked down to the sea bed for oil exploration.
   The fishing vessel Captain Gabriel reported the capsized rig at
about 7:15 p.m. Thursday in 90 feet of water about 26 miles south of
Freeport, Merwin said.
   Merwin said officials do not know what caused the capsize. There
was no heavy rainfall in the area and waves were only at 3 feet to 5
feet at the time, he said.
   The company that owns the drilling vessel is Jude St. Romain of
New Orleans.

   Workers picketed state mental health
institutions today in a wage protest, and hundreds stayed off the
job in defiance of a court order that an official said was intended
to protect the health of patients.
   ``Workers are frustrated and angry'' and willing to face the
consequences of a walkout, said Vince Trivelli, spokesman for the
Communications Workers of America. The union represents more than
half the state's 75,000 unionized workers.
   Leaders of the CWA and the American Federation of State, County
and Municipal Employees asked the state's 18,000 unionized mental
health workers, including doctors and nurses, to participate in the
protest at 18 facilities.
   No negotiations were scheduled for today in the pay dispute,
which began after the state proposed an 18-month wage freeze and 3
percent raises for two years.
   ``It's really degrading what the state offered to us. It's really
a slap in the face,'' John McKee, president of AFSME Local 2222,
said this morning outside the Trenton Psychiatric Hospital in Ewing.
   Trivelli confirmed that a back-to-work order had been served on
pickets, but he denied the job action would endanger patients.
   ``We've made arrangements at each hospital to ensure that
emergency care is available if needed,'' Trivelli said.
   The state attorney general's office cited patient health in
obtaining an injunction against the job action from Superior Court
Judge John Paul Levy just before midnight Thursday, said Mary Kay
Risi, spokeswoman for the Department of Human Services.
   Supervisors were re-assigned and employees were working more than
one shift to keep the centers staffed, officials said. At Trenton
Psychiatric Hospital in Ewing, a large blue van carried workers this
morning across picket lines set up by about a dozen workers at each
of four gates.
   The protesters said they moved away from the gates after
receiving the court order. Thursday night they had blocked the gates
while chanting, ``We're closed! Go home!''
   State officials said hundreds of workers began calling in sick
Thursday morning. Neither the state nor the union had figures for
how many workers were out today at psychiatric hospitals,
developmental centers and other facilities.

   President Bush, using the statue of the
nation's most famous flag-raising scene as a backdrop, today urged
passage and ratification of a ``simple, stark and to-the-point''
constitutional amendment to ban flag burning.
   The president spoke before a hastily assembled crowd at a
ceremony at the Iwo Jima Memorial, the statue of five Marines
raising the flag on a Pacific island during World War II.
   Bush used the ceremony to register his support for a
Republican-drafted proposed amendment that asserts: ``The Congress
and the states shall have power to prohibit the physical desecration
of the flag of the United States.''
   ``This flag is one of our most powerful ideas,'' Bush declared.
``If it is not defended, it is defamed ... it represents the fabric
of our nation.''
   Bush said the statue behind him, a huge bronze casting of a
photograph by Associated Press photographer Joe Rosenthal, was
``stunning ... even now it humbles us, inspires us.''
   Bush said the amendment drafted by Republican congressional
leaders with the support of some Democrats was ``simple, stark and
to-the-point.''
   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas praised Bush for
supporting the amendment and called it ``a serious step'' to
circumvent last week's 5-4 Supreme Court ruling that said flag
burning is a form of free expression protected by the Constitution.
   Dole said that people across the nation were speaking out against
the ruling. ``People are saying, keep your hands off Old Glory,'' he
said.
   Also speaking at the ceremony were co-sponsors of the amendment,
House Republican leader Robert Michel of Illinois and two Democrats,
Sen. Alan Dixon of Illinois and Rep. Sonny Montgomery of
Mississippi, chairman of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee.
   Bush announced his support for a constitutional amendment
forbidding flag-desecration at a news conference on Tuesday.
Although aides at first said the president would present his own
version of such an amendment, he later decided to join forces with
congressional leaders.
   Michel said today's ceremony at the monument adjoining Arlington
National Ceremony ``begins the process of protecting our flag.''
   The House leader said the amendment, which needs approval by
two-thirds margins in both House and Senate and then ratification by
38 state legislatures to take effect, ``seeks to protect the flag,
nothing more.''
   The president said the flag, flying over ``farm houses and state
houses, schools and courts and capitals, is borne on the breeze of
freedom.''
   ``The surest way to protect liberty is to protect the spirit that
sustains it,'' he said.
   Bush denied he was acting in a partisan fashion in pressing his
campaign for the flag amendment. ``Patriotism is not a partisan
issue, it is not a political issue,'' he told the audience, made up
mostly of administration officials and Republican members of
Congress.
   Both Democrats and Republicans have publicly deplored the Supreme
Court decision, but a spokesman for the Democratic National
Committee accused Bush of using the issue for political opportunism.
   ``He's running for president instead of being president,'' Mike
McCurry, DNC communications director, said Wednesday. ``The heroes
of Iwo Jima didn't die so they could become a backdrop for some
political photo opportunity.''
   Bush used the flag ceaselessly in his presidential campaign last
year. He visited a flag factory and attacked Democrat Michael
Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor, for vetoing as unconstitutional
a bill requiring the Pledge of Allegiance to be recited in schools.
   House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., introduced the
resolution Thursday before the House adjourned for its holiday
recess.
   Michel said he expects Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of
Kansas to introduce it there when that chamber returns from its
extended Fourth of July holiday, which began last week.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said Thursday the House
Judiciary Committee will begin hearings on the flag issue in July.
   Foley, while condemning flag burning, has urged caution about
amending the Constitution. Michel said he generally agrees, but
believes such action is the only answer in this case.
   ``I just have to assume we're not going to be thwarted,'' he
said, insisting he did not view the issue as a Republican attempt to
paint the Democrats as less patriotic.
   Montgomery joined Michel in introducing the resolution.
   Michel said the amendment avoids specific methods of desecration
because any list might leave one out. He pointed out, however, that
the amendment referred only to physical desecration in order to
avoid hampering free expression.

   Federal agents scoured the south
Texas coast after a fisherman found 5 kilograms of cocaine washed up
on the shore of Matagorda Island.
   Officials said a smuggling boat may have capsized during Tropical
Storm Allison early this week, dumping contraband into the water.
   ``We expect a large quantity of cocaine to wash ashore in the
next few days,'' Joe Flannery, agent in charge for the Drug
Enforcement Administration in Corpus Christi, said Thursday.
   The fisherman found the five bricks of cocaine near Port O'Connor
on Wednesday.
   Coast Guard officials heightened their surveillance of the Gulf
of Mexico and Customs Service agents were scouting the beaches along
Matagorda Island, said Flannery.
   The fact that no boat was reported missing aroused suspicions, he
said.
   ``If a boat went down and nobody reported it, that indicates it
was some type of smuggling operation,'' Flannery said.

<HEAD>Clashes Leave at Least 5 Indian Soldiers Dead; 13 Tamils Reported
Killed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tamil rebels ambushed and killed five
Indian soldiers in the northeastern jungles, but lost three of their
own men in the battle, military officials said today.
   The militants, however, said they killed seven soldiers in
Thursday's attack at Nayaru village in Mullaitivu district, 170
miles northeast of Colombo. Their statement did not give guerrilla
casualties.
   Military officials, who cannot be identified under briefing
rules, said 10 more rebels were killed by Indian troops in separate
skirmishes Thursday in Batticaloa in the east and Jaffna and
Vavuniya in the north.
   Indian diplomats said they were not immediately aware of the
clashes, which reportedly occurred a few hours before President
Ranasinghe Premadasa asked India to halt military operations against
Tamil rebels and withdraw its 45,000 troops.
   The rebels, from the dominant Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
group, are holding peace talks with the Sri Lankan government to
resolve their demands for a separate homeland. On Tuesday, the two
sides declared a cease-fire in the six-year war that has claimed
9,000 lives. But the rebels made no promises about attacks on Indian
soldiers.
   New Delhi today repeated previous refusals to stop fighting until
the insurgents surrender their arms.
   An Indian Foreign Ministry statement said: ``The latest
announcement is meaningless unless it reflects the Liberation
Tigers' commitment to the unity and integrity of Sri Lanka, and to
the giving up of violence, not only against the Sri Lankan
government, but also against fellow Tamils and other communities in
the Northeast Province.''
   The deployment of the Indian troops is causing friction between
Colombo and New Delhi.
   The troops arrived two years ago to disarm rebels under an
Indian-sponsored accord. But soon the militants launched a
counteroffensive in which at least 800 Indian soldiers and 1,500
rebels have been killed.
   Tamils want to set up an independent nation in the northeast,
where most of them live and where they are a majority. They allege
discrimination in jobs and education by Sinhalese who comprise 75
percent of the country's 16 million people. Most Sinhalese are
Buddhists and Tamils are mainly Hindu.

<TEXT>
   Here are excerpts from the speech by Deng
Xiaoping, senior Chinese leader and chairman of the Central Military
Commission, to military leaders after the crackdown on pro-democracy
demonstrators.
   The June 9 speech was published this week on the front pages of
all major Chinese newspapers. The following translation was from the
government's English-language China Daily:
   I'd like to express my heartfelt condolences to the comrades in
the People's Liberation Army, the armed police and police who died
in the struggle, and my sincere sympathy and solicitude to the
comrades in the army, the armed police and police who were wounded
in the struggle, and I want to extend my sincere regards to all the
army, armed police and police personnel who participated in the
struggle.
   This storm was bound to happen sooner or later. As determined by
the international and domestic climate, it was bound to happen and
was independent of man's will. It was just a matter of time and
scale.
   It has turned out in our favor, for we still have a large group
of veterans who have experienced many storms and have a thorough
understanding of things. They are on the side of taking resolute
action to counter the turmoil. Although some comrades may not
understand this now, they will understand eventually and will
support the decision of the (Communist Party) Central Committee.
   The April 26 editorial of the People's Daily classified the
problem as turmoil. The word was appropriate, but some people
objected to the word and tried to amend it. But what happened showed
that this verdict was right.
   It was also inevitable that the turmoil would develop into a
counterrevolutionary rebellion. We still have a group of senior
comrades who are alive, we still have the army, and we also have a
group of core cadres who took part in the revolution at various
times. That is why it was relatively easy for us to handle the
present matter.
   The main difficulty in handling this matter lay in that we had
never experienced such a situation before, in which a small minority
of bad people mixed with so many young students and onlookers.
   What we faced was not just some ordinary people who were
misguided but also a rebellious clique and a large number of the
dregs of society. The key point is that they wanted to overthrow our
state and the party.
   They had two main slogans: to overthrow the Communist Party and
topple the socialist system. Their goal was to establish a bourgeois
republic entirely dependent on the West. ... Their real aim was to
overthrow the Communist Party and topple the socialist system.
   Although it is very sad that so many comrades were sacrificed, if
the event is analyzed objectively, people cannot but recognize that
the PLA are the sons and brothers of the people. This will also help
people to understand the measures we used in the course of the
struggle. In the future, whenever the PLA faces problems and takes
measures, it will gain the support of the people.
   In a word, this was a test, and we passed. Even though there are
not so many veteran comrades in the army and the soldiers are mostly
little more than 18, 19 or 20 years of age, they are still true
soldiers of the people. Facing danger, they did not forget the
people, the teachings of the party and the interests of the country.
They kept a resolute stand in the face of death. They fully deserve
the saying that they met death and sacrificed themselves with
generosity and without fear.
   What they crossed this time was genuinely a political barrier, a
threshold of life and death. This is by no means easy. This shows
that the people's army is truly a Great Wall of iron and steel of
the party and country.
   This shows that no matter how heavy the losses we suffer and no
matter how generations change, this army of ours is forever an army
under te leadership of the party.
   In political reforms we can affirm one point: we have to insist
on implementing the system of the National People's Congress and not
the American system of the separation of three powers. The U.S.
berates us for suppressing students. But when they handled domestic
student unrest and turmoil, didn't they send out police and troops,
arrest people and shed blood? They were suppressing students and the
people, but we are putting down counterrevolutionary rebellion. What
qualifications do they have to criticize us?
   We must conscientiously sum up our experiences, persevere in what
is right, correct what is wrong, and do a bit more where we lag
behind. In short, we should sum up the experiences of the present
and look forward to the future.

<HEAD>Haughey Resigns in Bid to Form New Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Charles Haughey, Ireland's
great political survivor, has resigned after Parliament narrowly
refused to re-elect him.
   Haughey, 63, stepped down Thursday but said he would try to gain
support from the six-seat Progressive Democratic Party before making
a new bid for election by the Dail, or Parliament.
   The 166-member Dail adjourned Thursday until Monday.
   Haughey said he would stay on as caretaker prime minister and not
ask President Patrick Hillery to dissolve Parliament and call an
election.
   His resignation was seen as a formality enforced by demands from
two opposing parties _ the Fine Gael and the left-wing Labor Party _
that he follow constitutional procedure.
   Haughey, whose political astuteness and staying power have long
confounded opponents, was rebuffed when legislators rejected his
nomination in an 86-78 vote.
   He had failed in his gamble to call an election June 15 in hopes
of winning an outright parliamentary majority.
   The 81-seat minority government, elected 28 months ago by the
slimmest margin possible, lost four seats in the June vote.
Haughey's Fianna Fail Party, which has governed Ireland for 44 of
its 67 years as an independent state, was again denied the chance to
form the first single-party majority government since 1977-81.
   Haughey appears to be calculating that the opposition will want
to avoid another election and the Progressive Democrats will support
him rather than risk blame for steering the country into greater
constitutional disarray.
   Other candidates have little hope of winning a majority to form a
government.
   Haughey has won and lost office twice and has weathered a slew of
scandals, economic problems and party infighting. He is dubbed ``The
Great Survivor.''
   After his 1987 victory, Haughey adopted economic remedies once
advocated by his opponents to cut Ireland's borrowing and end a
recession.
   But critics complain the measures have not reached many of the
poor and the young. Unemployment remains at 17.9 percent, and
emigration is at its highest level in three decades.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Between 570 and 670 people will die in traffic
accidents during the four-day Fourth of July weekend, according to
estimates by the National Safety Council.
   For counting purposes, the holiday period will begin at 6 p.m.
today and end at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday, local time.
   The estimate of 570 to 670 compares with an average toll of 540
on a normal four-day weekend period during this time of year, the
council said.
   Last year, there were 463 highway deaths during the three-day
Fourth of July holiday weekend.
   The highest toll for a four-day Fourth of July holiday period was
recorded in 1972, when 758 people were killed. The highest toll for
a three-day Independence Day weekend was 638 deaths in 1971.

   The chief mate of the Greek tanker that
ran aground on Brenton Reef apologized today for the accident that
spilled 420,000 gallons of heating oil into Narragansett Bay.
   ``The only thing I have to say is that the captain is one of the
best captains I ever saw on board in the years of my experience on
boats,'' Georgios Vlahos told a federal board of inquiry.
   ``I am very sorry for this happening. I don't know what else to
say. I think it was a very bad time and all else is in your hands,''
he said.
   Vlahos, 27, was granted federal immunity to get him to testify
before the Coast Guard-National Transportation Safety Board inquiry
into the June 23 accident off Newport. The helmsman also was given
immunity.
   A grand jury is investigating possible violations of a state law
requiring a harbor pilot on board vessels inside a line from Point
Judith to Sakkonet Point.
   The World Prodigy had no pilot on board when it ran aground
inside the area in which the state requires a pilot.
   Vlahos said the World Prodigy was on the slowest speed possible,
dead slow, when it ran aground. The mate said he had just returned
to the bridge and was unsure what the ship's exact speed was or its
course in the moments before the accident. He said the captain,
Iakovos Georgudis, had made many turns during his approach to
Narragansett Bay to avoid small boats in the area.
   Re-creating the vessel's course and speed before the accident
will be a major part of the investigation, said Richard Johnson, one
of two safety board investigators hearing the case.
   Georgudis, 43, remained confined aboard ship in lieu of $50,000
bail on federal pollution charges.
   On Thursday, a Commerce Department guide, titled ``United States
Coast Pilot,'' was entered as evidence at the hearing. The guide
advises foreign ships and U.S. vessels on foreign trips that they
need to board a pilot outside the line from Point Judith to Sakkonet
Point before entering the bay.
   But it also says pilots board at the Brenton Reef Light Tower,
about 1{ miles inside the line, said Lt. Cmdr. Theo Moniz III of the
Coast Guard marine safety office in Providence.
   Norman Lidstone, coxswain of the boat that brought pilot David
Leonard to the tanker, said that although most pilots meet their
ships 1 to 1{ miles southeast of the tower, some ships whose
captains are familiar with the area meet pilots closer to the reef.
   Outbound ships sometimes let pilots off 2{ miles north of the
tower, inside the bay near the Castle Hill Coast Guard Station,
Lidstone said.
   In the wake of other oil spills last weekend, developments
included:
   _ Delaware filed a federal lawsuit Thursday against the captain
of the Presidente Rivera, Raul DiBarrart, as an agent of the
Uruguayan government, which owns the ship. The suit charges the
tanker violated Delaware's pollution laws. The Uruguayan tanker ran
aground early Saturday, spilling 306,684 gallons of heavy heating
fuel, according to Coast Guard estimates. Delaware officials said
the cleanup was progressing well.
   _ In Texas, witnesses testified at a Coast Guard inquiry that a
collision between a Panamanian tanker and a barge last week might
have been avoided if not for a buildup of sediment in the Bayport
Channel. The collision resulted in 250,000 gallons of oil being
spilled into Galveston Bay. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
confirmed the channel does have a buildup of sediment, according to
the Houston Chronicle.
   At the Rhode Island hearing, Lidstone said the World Prodigy
first radioed it was 2{ miles from the rendezvous and confirmed
Leonard's account of trying to warn the tanker away from the rocks.
   ``The next thing I saw was his bow raising out of the water, in
slow motion, so to say'' as the ship ran aground, Lidstone said.
   Lidstone said the World Prodigy ``looked like he was closing
pretty fast, or faster than normal,'' but he could not say if it was
too fast.
   The Coast Guard has estimated cleanup costs at $1.6 million.
Crews have finished unloading nearly 8 million gallons of oil that
remained on board and are waiting for a salvage plan from the ship's
owner, Ballard Shipping Co., said Lt. Paul Wolf.

   United Mine Workers leaders are urging
striking members to remain peaceful in their efforts to force the
Pittston Coal Group Inc. to sign a contract.
   About 1,500 UMW members gathered this morning for what had been
billed as a rally at a football field. The meeting was moved into
Logan Memorial Field House, and union officials barred reporters.
   Danny Wells, who becomes a UMW District 17 international board
member Saturday, said the miners wanted to discuss certain matters
in private. He would not say what those issues were.
   Four coal trucks in West Virginia and Virginia have been hit by
bullets this week and two others damaged by steel balls fired from
slingshots, police said. Striking Pittston employees and wildcat
sympathy strikers blocked traffic on coal-hauling roads Thursday. No
arrests were reported, but Pittston said a security employee
suffered a cut on his head in a confrontation.
   ``We are doing our best to make sure our people are still in a
non-violent frame of mind,'' said Roger Horton, vice president of
UMW Local 5958 in Dehue. ``We cannot win with any type of violence.''
   Horton was an organizer of the meeting today in support of 1,900
union members on strike against Pittston in West Virginia, Virginia
and Kentucky.
   At Elkem Metals Co. in Alloy this morning, 300 members of the
Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers union walked off the job for half
an hour in support of the Pittston strikers.
   ``We're willing to tolerate it if it's limited to 30 minutes,''
said Gary Moore, the plant's employee relations manager.
   The Pittston workers went on strike peacefully in April after 14
months without a contract. But there have been scattered violent
incidents since thousands of union miners in Appalachia and the
Midwest went on a wildcat strike in sympathy with the Pittston
workers 2{ weeks ago.
   Union and coal company officials estimate about 37,000 miners in
eight states are on strike, although the start of the traditional
summer vacation period this week has made it difficult to determine
precise numbers. States affected include Alabama, Illinois, Indiana,
Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and West Virginia.
   The UMW has not publicly sanctioned the sympathy walkout and has
urged wildcatters to go back to work.
   The head of West Virginia's third-leading coal producer,
frustrated that UMW officials won't answer his phone calls, says he
blames the shutdown on the union.
   ``As far as I'm concerned, I'm for calling this contract null and
void right now,'' said Paul Kiser, president of Beckley-based Maben
Energy Corp. ``If the union can't live up to its agreement, what
good is it?''
   Danny Wells, a UMW district spokesman, said Maben Energy remains
under contract until 1993.
   ``Companies haven't been living up to their contracts with the
union, either,'' Wells said. ``But we still have an agreement. Mr.
Kiser will find that pulling out of his contract will be easier said
than done.''
   The Pittston miners have concentrated on the company's withdrawal
from a national contract to win work rule changes it says are
necessary to meet competition from foreign producers.
   The strike's focus has turned to health benefits in recent days,
though. Pittston has refused to contribute to two health plans and
two related retirement funds since its contract with the UMW expired
in February 1988, court documents show.
   The union and the UMW Health and Retirement Funds have filed
lawsuits against the company. UMW spokesman John Duray estimates
Pittston owes as much as $10 million to the UMW Health and Benefits
Fund, a figure Pittston wouldn't confirm, the Charleston Daily Mail
reported Thursday.
   Documents show that the two health plans spent more money than
they earned last year, and the Daily Mail said both funds continue
to lose money.
   Pittston lawyer John Wood contends Pittston had the right to pull
out of the benefit plans when its UMW contract expired in February
1988.

<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Military forces said they seized power
today by overthrowing the civilian government of Prime Minister
Sadek el-Mahdi. No casualties were reported.
   The coup leadership suspended the constitution, placed the
country under a state of emergency, and declared a nighttime curfew
in the capital, Khartoum, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported
from Khartoum. Parliament and political parties were disbanded and
newspaper licenses revoked, it said.
   The agency identified the coup leader as Omar Hassan Ahmed
el-Bashir and said he signed the decrees. The whereabouts of
el-Mahdi was not known.
   El-Bashir has been the third-ranking officer in the paratroop
corps and previously commanded a unit in southern Sudan, according
to the report.
   El-Bashir appeared to be the same person as a man identified as
Brig. Gen. Omar Hassan who announced the coup on official Radio
Omdurman.
   Paratroop and armored units staged the coup, according to the
agency, and it indicated the coup leaders were not from the top
echelons of the Sudanese military command. ``The coup leaders have
designated the general command and army leaders as `the former
command,''' it said.
   Soldiers occupied the presidential palace, Cabinet offices, Radio
Omdurman, and the official Sudan News Agency. Khartoum International
Airport and Sudanese airspace were declared closed.
   The agency said ``some political figures and Cabinet ministers''
were arrested but it was uncertain if they included el-Mahdi, who
became prime minister after a May 1986 general election.
   A Western diplomat in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, said he had heard
the coup leaders tried to arrest the prime minister at his home in
Khartoum but that el-Mahdi escaped.
   A military statement said the coup was launched because political
parties failed to lead the nation.
   In February, the military said it would move against el-Mahdi
unless he ended Sudan's six-year civil war by accepting a tentative
peace pact worked out between an opposition party and southern
rebels. The war has contributed to food riots, widespread hunger in
the south and a severe refugee problem.
   The whereabouts of former President Gaafar Nimeiri, accused by
the military June 18 of being behind a failed coup, was not known.
Nimeiri was overthrown in 1985 and said recently he planned to
return to Sudan to seize power.
   Sudan, the largest country in Africa, has about 22 million
residents. It is a poor, predominantly Islamic country roughly
one-third the size of the continental United States.
   The military has ruled Sudan for about 23 years of its 33 years
of independence.
   Gili Farah, a Sudan News Agency journalist, said there were no
reports of violence during or after the coup.
   Traffic was banned on bridges spanning the White Nile and the
Blue Nile, but the capital of 2 million appeared otherwise normal
for the Moslem sabbath. No celebrations or demonstrations were
evident.
   Omdurman Radio went off the air early today but resumed
transmissions at 8 a.m. with martial music.
   ``The June revolution has come to restore to the Sudanese citizen
his injured dignity and rebuild the Sudan of the future,'' the
agency quoted the radio as saying.
   The Middle East News Agency said the coup leaders identified
themselves as the Command Council of the National Salvation
Revolution, banned political opposition and political gatherings and
would issue all major legislative and executive decrees. Its
chairman is to serve as prime minister, defense minister and armed
forces commander-in-chief, it said.
   A text of a statement on the radio, read by Brig. Gen. Hassan and
also distributed by the Middle East News Agency, said soldiers
staged the coup because el-Mahdi had ``wasted the country's time and
squandered its energies.''
   El-Mahdi, 53, became the country's first civilian leader in 17
years when his Umma Party won general elections 37 months ago. He
replaced a transitional military government that overthrew Nimeiri
in April 1985.
   His government was dogged by the rebellion of the Sudan People's
Liberation Army, which began under Nimeiri and _ exacerbated by
famine and flood _ has caused economic disarray in Sudan.
   Even after the famine ended with rains two years ago, hundreds of
thousands of southern Sudanese died last year because the war kept
them from their fields or drove them from their homes in search of
shelter.
   Both sides have used food and control of relief supplies as
weapons in the conflict over the northerner-controlled government's
economic, political and administrative policies toward the south.
   The armed forces announced on June 18 that supporters of Nimeiri
had tried a coup but failed. Later reports from Khartoum said
several dozen military officers and civilians were arrested in the
coup attempt.
   Nimeiri, a political refugee in Cairo since he was overthrown,
denied he was behind that coup attempt. But he said in an interview
last week that he intended to return to Sudan and expressed
confidence he would regain power.
   On Sunday, a Nimeiri aide in Cairo said the former president had
left Egypt two days earlier. The aide refused to disclose Nimeiri's
destination.
   Today's coup announcement gave no indication that the former
president was involved.

   Federal prosecutors are investigating an
alleged homosexual prostitution ring that catered to political
figures including a Labor Department official, who resigned when the
investigation was made public.
   The investigation is based on financial records and other
material seized in raids on a house in an upscale Washington
neighborhood that police say was used by escort services with names
such as ``Dream Boys'' and ``Man to Man.''
   U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens on Thursday confirmed the
investigation into allegedly fraudulent multiple billings of the
services' patrons, after The Washington Times reported that the ring
was patronized by Reagan and Bush administration officials,
congressional aides and one of its own former editors.
   One of a handful of individuals named in the Times article, Paul
R. Balach, resigned Thursday evening.
   ``I hereby resign my position this date due to the public
disclosure of activities concerning my personal life,'' Balach said
in a letter announcing his resignation as Labor Secretary Elizabeth
Dole's political personnel liaison to the White House.
   The Times quoted Balach as saying department Solicitor Robert
Davis told him he had a choice of resigning or being fired. He said
he was not allowed to talk to Mrs. Dole about the matter.
   ``They promised me that they would try and find me another
position somewhere in the government, but I just don't know ...
Somebody else is going to clean out my office. They didn't want me
to come back into the office,'' Balach said.
   Balach told the Times that thousands of dollars in charges were
run up on his credit cards without his knowledge after he used the
service.
   The Times said another of the ring's clients was so politically
well-connected that he was able to arrange a middle-of-the night
tour of the White House in July 1988 for a group including two male
prostitutes.
   Secret Service agents and District of Columbia police raided the
escort service house in Northwest Washington on two occasions, in
February and May.
   In applying for search warrants, district police Detective Gerald
W. Robertson said the investigation had produced ``probable cause to
believe that records and evidence related to an interstate
prostitution business'' were located there.
   Stephens refused to talk about allegations of the homosexual
ring, but said in a statement that his office ``has been
investigating alegations involving credit card fraud arising from
the execution of those warrants.''
   During the raids, officers confiscated multi-line telephones,
paging devices, credit card imprinters, numerous bank statements,
credit card slips and a diary of the escort business, according to
an inventory filed in U.S. District Court.
   The Times said it has obtained a number of credit card slips and
it identified individuals who paid for services, including Balach.
   Labor Department sources said Balach initially decided Thursday
morning to take a few days' annual leave after being named by the
Times as a patron of the escort services. He resigned Thursday
evening.
   In an interview before his resignation was announced, Balach
said, ``I have been a victim. I'm cooperating fully. I've talked
several times with the Secret Service.'' He declined to elaborate,
but said the Times had published ``an accurate account of the
turmoil I've been through'' the last few months.
   The Times quoted unnamed witnesses and law enforcement agents as
saying the Secret Service kept one box of seized files containing
names and other information about high-level government officials
who were clients of the escort businesses.
   Law enforcement officials familiar with the probe said
investigators have obtained credit card receipts and phone logs
linking additional political figures to the prostitution ring. The
officials refused to be quoted by name or provide additional details.
   Robert Snow, a spokesman for the Secret Service, said its agents
are working for Stephens. He said the U.S. attorney will present the
case to a grand jury.
   The Times said Stanley Mark Tapscott, one of its former assistant
managing editors, was among those who used the escort services.
Tapscott, who resigned June 20, said he had not paid for sexual
services of any kind, but was conducting an investigation into
dial-a-porn services. The paper said its editors were unaware of any
such reporting assignment.
   Another individual identified by the Times as a patron of the
escort services was Charles K. Dutcher, former associate director of
presidential personnel in the Reagan administration. Dutcher, now a
private consultant, told the newspaper that ``stress'' drove him to
seek out a male prostitute once.
   Calls to Dutcher's home were not answered and he did not
immediately return messages left on his answering machine.

   Rebels in northern Uganda fired on a
33-vehicle relief convoy returning from southern Sudan and wounded a
U.N. worker, a U.N. official said today.
   The attack occurred Monday at Pawel, about 60 miles south of
Sudan's border in Uganda's Gulu district, said Arthur Holbrook of
the U.N. World Food Program.
   He said the rebels opened fire on the convoy and forced it to
stop, but let it continue on to Kampala, the capital, upon finding
the vehicles empty.
   Holbrook would not identify the injured U.N. official other than
to say he was a Swiss male who was wounded in the arm. The Guide
newspaper said he was treated at a hospital and released.
   It was the first attack on a relief convoy in Uganda since the
U.N. agency started to transport food by road to southern Sudan in
May, Holbrook said.
   The convoy was part of an 3-month-old international effort to
stock food in southern Sudan, where relief officials say an
estimated 100,000 people face starvation.

<HEAD>Art Institute School Develops New Rules for Controversial Displays</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trustees of a Chicago art school where two recent
exhibits _ including one of a U.S. flag on the floor _ caused heated
protests have issued strict new guidelines allowing for removal of
``disruptive'' student artworks.
   Under guidelines released Thursday, the School of the Art
Institute of Chicago can ``relocate or remove'' any exhibit that may
violate the law or be ``hazardous to the health and or safety of
viewers or participants.''
   The guidelines, formulated by a committee of students, teachers
and administrators, also give the school the authority to determine
``when, if, how long and where'' students' art will be shown.
   Displays that ``may be disruptive to the educational process''
can be relocated or removed, the rules say.
   Marshall Field V, president of the board of trustees, spelled out
the new policy in a letter to board members.
   A long debate in arriving at the guidelines shows ``the extreme
difficulty of balancing personal freedom of expression in an
educational environment with responsiblities to ... community
concerns and public sensitivities,'' Field wrote.
   The Art Institute has been the site of protests within the past
two years over two student exhibits _ one that included an American
flag on the floor where it could be walked on and the other a
painting of the late Mayor Harold Washington in women's
undergarments.
   Harvey Grossman, legal director of the American Civil Liberties
Union in Illinois, said the guideline governing health and safety
hazards is ``particularly vague and could result in chilling and
inhibiting student creativity and expression.''
   Grossman said school officials should explain to students ``just
what that standard means. ... I'm sure they intend to do that.''
   Among those angered by the flag exhibit were members of the
Illinois Legislature, who added a provision to the bill on state
arts council funds this spring specifying that the Art Institute get
only $1 during the fiscal year that begins Saturday. A spokesman for
Gov. James Thompson has said he will probably veto that section of
the bill.

   The United States and Soviet Union have agreed on
inspection procedures for chemical arms sites that will be included
in a draft proposal for a global ban on the weapons, a Soviet
official said today.
   But the chief U.S. delegate to the talks, Max Friedersdorf, said
the Soviet statements appeared to be ``premature and exaggerated.''
   He declined to comment on the substance of the talks, which ended
Thursday. While the latest round brought some progress,
``fundamental differences'' remain, he said.
   The Soviet official, who briefed reporters on condition of
anonymity, also said progress should not be overrated.
   ``I'm not saying now that we have this document, we can sign the
convention tomorrow,'' he said.
   The chemical weapons talks began in 1986 after the first summit
between then-President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
   The latest round, the first under the Bush administration, lasted
three weeks. The Soviet official said the talks will resume later
this year.
   He said the superpowers moved toward an accord on exchanging data
on chemical weapons sites, including factories and military depots,
and that they were in virtual agreement on provisions for the
destruction of such arms under a global ban.
   While the talks apply only to the superpowers, the official said
an accord would be designed to speed progress toward a global ban.
   He said the two governments plan to submit agreements on
inspections and destruction of chemical weapon stocks to the
40-nation Geneva Conference on Disarmament.
   The official said the inspection procedures, worked out after
months of disagreement, include mandatory short-notice checks of
chemical weapons sites by an international team of experts if a
country is accused of violating a ban.

<HEAD>School Throws Out More Regents Test Results Because of Cheating</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BAUDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A New York City high school has thrown out
the results of a math Regents test because about 40 percent of the
students taking it apparently cheated, education officials said.
   It's the first test to be invalidated in a growing school
cheating scandal that erupted last week when a newspaper published
the answer key of a Regents chemistry exam to illustrate a busy
black market in stolen exams. The chemistry test was subsequently
canceled.
   More invalidations are expected as test results are calculated,
state Education Department spokesman Christopher Carpenter said
Thursday.
   Of the 504 students at the public Benjamin Cardozo High School in
Queens who took the test, a review of results showed about 100
clearly cheated, said Principal Bertram Linder.
   School officials were told even honors students cheated, although
this is tougher to trace by the results, he said. Linder said he
believes about 200 students, mostly sophomores, cheated.
   ``We saw a great deal of evidence that the youngsters have had
access to answer keys _ so much so that not to take action would be
giving kids the wrong message,'' Linder said.
   Seven students caught with evidence of cheating have been
disciplined.
   The math test invalidated at Cardozo was given the same day the
New York Post, saying Regents tests were being actively bought and
sold around New York City high schools, published the answers to the
chemistry test on its front page. Education officials had denounced
the Post for printing the answers.
   In today's editions, the newspaper reported that 24 students in
Queens, including honors students from public and private high
schools, have admitted to investigators that they sold answers to
the Regents exams.
   Two students admitted trying to sell a package of four tests to
two teen-age gangs for $4,500, the Post said, citing unidentified
sources.
   Regents tests, given in 17 subjects over a two-week period,
generally account for about 25 percent of a student's grade. In the
case of the canceled Cardozo test, students can take a re-test or
simply have classroom results account for their full grade, Linder
said.

   A quiet, churchgoing accountant was returned
to New Jersey to face charges that he murdered his wife, three
children and mother in their suburban home 18 years ago.
   Robert P. Clark, who authorities say is really John E. List,
arrived from Richmond, Va., on Thursday after waiving extradition
proceedings. He signed the extradition papers as Clark.
   Also Thursday, authorities in Seattle said they were weighing the
possibility that List was the long-vanished hijacker named ``D.B.
Cooper.'' Clark's lawyer called the notion ridiculous.
   Although the man known as Clark denies he is List, authorities
say fingerprints and a scar prove Clark and List are the same man.
   Reporters were not allowed onto the tarmac at Newark
International Airport, where Clark was led handcuffed to a car and
taken to the county jail in Elizabeth. No court arraignment was
immediately scheduled.
   In Richmond earlier, Clark, 63, did not respond to reporters'
questions as he boarded the plane.
   Clark's attorney, David Baugh, said he advsed Clark to waive
extradition and that he was stepping out of the case because Clark
had no legal matters pending in Virgina.
   Baugh declined to identify Clark's New Jersey attorney.
   Clark was arrested June 1 at the Richmond accounting firm where
he had worked for 1{ years. FBI agents had been tipped off by a
viewer of the national television program, ``America's Most
Wanted,'' which 11 days earlier had run a segment focusing on List.
   Authorities say List fled to Colorado and then Virginia and had
built a new life without changing his appearance or profession.
   An FBI spokesman in Seattle said Thursday that List is considered
a suspect in the November 1971 hijacking of a plane by a man known
as D.B. Cooper.
   ``John List is one of any number of people suspected in the D.B.
Cooper case,'' FBI spokesman John Eyer said. ``He will be
investigated until he is eliminated.''
   Clark's attorney Baugh scoffed at any connection between his
former client and D.B. Cooper.
   ``I have heard that ...,'' Baugh said. ``But I also heard that
Elvis is living in Detroit now. I put those two together.''
   Ralph Himmelsbach, a retired FBI agent who investigated the
hijacking, the only unsolved skyjacking in U.S. history, believes
Cooper died, but said List warrants investigating.
   Himmelsbach, who now lives in Portland, Ore., said List and
Cooper have similar descriptions. Cooper was described as in his
mid-40's. List was 44 at the time of the slayings. Both were about
the same height and weight and wore glasses.
   Himmelsbach also said List had spent the last $200,000 of his
mother's savings account shortly before the killings. Cooper
demanded and received $200,000 before parachuting from the plane
near Mount St. Helens in Washington state. He was never found.

   An unemployed mechanic on his way to a job
interview entered a burning house five times in 20 minutes and saved
three children from the blaze.
   Five children and two adults survived the fire Thursday morning.
In addition to the three children rescued by Carl Donato, another
boy jumped out of a window, and neighbors said a small child was
dropped from a window and caught. The adults escaped on their own.
   The Philadelphia Inquirer reduced optimism in Utah that the sun's energy
source can be produced at room temperature, as fusion research moves
ahead with the help of General Electric.
   The University of Utah and GE announced Wednesday that their
scientists will collaborate in attempts to verify and explain the
widely disputed findings announced in March by university chemist B.
Stanley Pons and British colleague Martin Fleischmann.
   The collaboration is the first such agreement the university has
made with a major corporation, but doesn't rule out similar
arrangements with other companies, said James Brophy, the school's
vice president for research.
   Pons and Fleischmann maintain they were able in a tabletop
experiment to produce more than 100 times the energy needed to
produce it.
   Some researchers at other laboratories have duplicated parts of
the experiment, but Ames Laboratory officials said in Ames, Iowa,
that they had been unable to produce results similar to those
claimed by Pons and Fleischmann.
   ``I wish I could tell you otherwise,'' Tom Barton, a professor of
chemistry at Iowa State University and director of the federal
laboratory, said. ``I was just as excited as everybody else when the
revelations were made.
   ``I thought our energy crisis was over,'' he said.
   ``We explored (the findings) to the limits of our equipment and
expertise,'' he said Wednesday. ``I'm sorry to say we detected
nothing. It would have been exciting.''
   Ames Laboratory physicist Joseph Shinar said scientists are no
longer thinking of cold fusion as a source of energy. But he said
academics will continue looking into the matter.
   At the Utah Capitol on Thursday, the state fusion advisory
council met privately to hear progress reports from Utah and Texas
scientists. The council was created to decide whether and how to
spend $5 million set aside by the Legislature to fund fusion
research.
   Randy Moon, state science adviser and a member of the council,
said members were ``very encouraged and very upbeat'' about the
presentations, but he wouldn't elaborate.

<TEXT>
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, the flamboyant adviser
to Tawana Brawley, pleaded innocent today to tax evasion and related
charges of stealing more than $250,000 in charitable funds.
   Sharpton, 34, was arrested Thursday in New York City on a
67-count indictment for fraud, grand larceny and falsifying business
records of the National Youth Movement, which he started at age 16.
   Asked how he pleaded on that indictment, obtained by state
Attorney General Robert Abrams, Sharpton replied, ``I believe the
attorney general's insane.'' The judge released Sharpton without
bail, but the self-styled civil rights leader quickly was rearrested
and spent the night jailed in Albany.
   At an appearance this morning in Albany County Court, Sharpton
pleaded innocent to failing to file a state income tax return for
1986 and two counts of false filings for 1987.
   Judge John Turner set bond at $20,000 for the felony charges,
punishable by up to five years in prison and $60,000 in fines.
Sharpton posted the bail about an hour and was released about an
hour later.
   ``Rev. Sharpton has the same obligation as everyone else to pay
his taxes,'' said Victor Jenecin, an assistant state attorney
general. The prosecutor charged that Sharpton owed $26,000 in state
income taxes in 1986 and evaded $9,000 in state income taxes in 1987.
   Jenecin said Sharpton evaded state income taxes by living on cash
withdrawn from the bank accounts of the National Youth Movement. The
New York City indictment said Sharpton falsely portrayed the
organization as a charity that would set up anti-drug programs.
   Victims of the fraud who made tax-deductible donations to the
National Youth Movement included multimillionaire devoper Donald
Trump, the Don King Foundation, CBS Inc., Warner Communications, the
Coca-Cola and Pepsico companies, and record companies, including
Arista, A&amp;M, RCA and Polygram, prosecutors said.
   Sharpton has claimed Abrams was out to get him because of
Sharpton's role as an adviser to Miss Brawley, a black teen-ager who
claimed a gang of white males abducted and raped her in November
1987.
   Abrams denied the accusation at a news conference.
   ``The investigation of the National Youth Movement and Rev.
Sharpton began at least a year before the Brawley investigation,''
he said.
   Brawley and her advisers refused to cooperate with police and
prosecutors and a seven-month grand jury investigation found that
her allegations were a hoax. Abrams was the state's special
prosecutor in the case.
   Maddox, who was Miss Brawley's lawyer, called Sharpton's
prosecution ``a political witchhunt.'' On the tax-evasion charges,
Maddox said Sharpton believes black people do not owe the government
anything, and instead should be paid reparations.
   The most serious charge against Sharpton in New York City, grand
larceny, is punishable by up to seven years in jail.

   Three men were arrested Friday for
smuggling 194 giant salamanders out of China valued at $3.8 million,
police reported.
   The salamanders, which police said were between 8 inches and 39
inches long, are listed as endangered species by China.
   The salamanders are considered a delicacy in the southeastern
Chinese city of Guizhou, where they grow in creeks, said Tang
Hsiao-yu, an official of Taiwan's state Council of Agriculture.
   Acting on a tip, police arrested the smugglers in their coastal
house in Ilan, 30 miles southeast of Taipei.
   Police said the lizards were smuggled into Taiwan on fishing
boats. Such illegal trading with China across the Taiwan straits
began flourishing two years ago as relations between the two nations
improved.
   The three men, if convicted, could be sentenced to three years in
prison.

<HEAD>FDA Investigating Drug Manufacturer Alleged to Have Falsified Tests</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDs: New material, editing throughout to include comment, more detail.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration said today it
is investigating a New York drug manufacturer that a House
subcommittee alleges falsified tests to win approval for its generic
version of a drug used to treat high blood pressure.
   The House Energy and Commerce investigations subcommittee alleges
that a generic version of Dyazide made by Vitarine Pharmaceuticals
Inc. of Springfield Gardens, N.Y., was sold to the public for more
than a year without undergoing full safety tests.
   Vitarine recalled the drug earlier this month because of concerns
that faulty data may have been submitted to the FDA in an
application for approval of the drug.
   The subcommittee, in a letter to Vitarine on Thursday, said it
had learned the company told FDA officials that instead of using the
Vitarine generic for comparison tests with the originally
forumulated Dyazide, the company substituted Dyazide for its product.
   The result, the subcommittee said, was that a sample of Dyazide
was tested against another sample of Dyazide, and the Vitarine
sample was never measured against the original to see if it is
absorbed into the body at the same rate and to the same extent as
Dyazide.
   ``The new information raises serious concerns'' about the safety
of Vitarine's product, said Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., in a letter
to the FDA. He is chairman of the investigations subcommittee of the
House Energy and Commerce Committee.
   ``The drug (the Vitarine generic) is not what was tested, so you
don't have any idea whether it is safe,'' said a subcommittee
source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``The FDA is in the middle of an ongoing investigation of
Vitarine and it would be improper to comment any further at this
time,'' said spokesman Jeff Nesbit. Asked whether the FDA had safety
concerns about Dyazide or either of its generic versions, he said,
``no,'' but added, ``I really can't speak to that.''
   Asked about Dingell's allegations, Alan Kaplan, a Washington
attorney representing Vitarine, said: ``This is a matter that is
being investigated and Vitarine has advised the FDA of this
possibility. It's still under investigation. There's no definite
conclusion at this time.''
   He said the investigation ``involves certain products in which
certain people have been working,'' and at least three Vitarine
employees have been suspended.
   Dyazide, made by SmithKline Beckman Corp., is one of the most
widely prescribed drugs in the country. Before its first generic
competition appeared in 1987, sales were more than $300 million
annually. However, after the first generic competition, made by
Bolar Pharmaceutical, came on the market, SmithKline's Dyazide sales
dropped 45 percent to $200 million in 1988, said SmithKline
spokesman Jeremy Heymsfeld.
   Vitarine's generic version won FDA approval in February 1988.
   The subcommittee said the allegations against Vitarine also raise
questions about Bolar's generic version and SmithKline's original.
   A subcommittee source said the tests showed that the two samples
were not identicial even though SmithKline's original product
allegedly was being compared with itself, instead of with the
Vitarine generic drug.
   Gene Pfeifer, an attorney for Bolar and a former FDA lawyer, said
such differences are not unusual because of the nature of the tests.
He said Bolar is confident that its product is safe.
   Jeremy Heymsfeld, a SmithKline spokesman, also expressed his
company's confidence in the safety and effectiveness of its product,
which he said ``has been demonstrated in millions of patients for
more than 20 years.''
   The subcommittee asked Pharmakinetics of Baltimore, Md., the
laboratory that conducted the tests comparing Vitarine's product and
Bolar's version with the SmithKline original, to hold all samples of
the drugs.
   Mark Perkal, executive vice president of Pharmakinetics, said the
company was cooperating with the agency. He said there was no way
the lab would have known whether a company submitted false test
samples. ``We're not in the business to detect fraud,'' he said.
   The comparison studies are one of two major tests key to the
FDA's approval of a generic, lower-cost version of a prescription
drug. The bioequivalence tests, which are the ones at issue in the
Vitarine case, examine the rate and extent of absorption of the drug
to determine whether it works with the same effectiveness as the
original. To be approved as a generic version, a drug must also
undergo a chemical review of its active ingredients.
   Dingell's subcommittee has been conducting an investigation into
alleged bribery in the FDA's generic drug division. The Justice
Department also is investigating the allegations.
   An FDA source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the
agency doubts Vitarine's product is unsafe because it had undergone
a chemical review and it had no reports of any problems with anyone
who used the drug.

   Americans Grace Bumbry and Neil Shicoff have
canceled their appearances as Carmen and Don Jose in a production of
Bizet's opera ``Carmen'' next week in the ancient Roman arena at
Nimes.
   Organizers of the Nimes Festival said both cited health problems
as the reason they could not perform in the opera July 3, 5 and 7.
   ``Miss Bumbry twisted her knee,'' festival spokesman Elisabeth
Hermann said. ``It's really too bad, but you can't have a Carmen who
limps.''
   Shicoff, a tenor, cannot make it because of bad health and
fatigue, she said.
   Miss Bumbry is to be replaced by Livia Buda of Hungary and the
new Don Jose will be the Italian tenor Georgio Aristo.
   The production will feature Budapest Orchestra conducted by Rico
Saccani and the Bulgarian national choir, along with the rest of the
cast of 100 singers and 20 picadors, with Antoine Bourseiller
directing.
   Costumes and sets have been designed by a native son of
neighboring Arles: Christian Lacroix.

   Friedrich Hacker, a psychiatrist who
pioneered studies in human aggression and the roots of terrorism,
has died at the age of 75.
   Hacker died of a heart attack June 23 after collapsing during a
live talkshow on West Germany's ZDF television network.
   The Austrian-born Hacker was considered an expert in the causes
of human aggression and had written widely on the psychology of
terrorism.
   Hacker frequently was called as an expert witness in U.S.
criminal trials, which included defense testimony at the trial of
newspaper heiress Patty Hearst.
   Hacker also worked with police to establish a psychological
profile of suspects in the 1969 murder of actress Sharon Tate, which
led to the arrest of Charles Manson and several of his cult
followers.
   Hacker was the founder of the Sigmund Freud Society and had
residences in Austria and the United States.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cardinal Frantisek Tomasek
celebrated his 90th birthday Friday amid greetings from church
leaders and dissidents, as well as the communist authorities he has
pressed for more religious freedom.
   ``His mere existence is important for believers,'' said the Rev.
Vaclav Maly, who was banned from preaching in churches in 1979
because he helped form the Charter 77 human rights group.
   ``They know somebody from the church hierarchy is there to defend
them. He is a symbol of confidence, courage and the authentic
defense of religious rights,'' Maly said.
   Jan Lebeda, a bishop of Prague, wrote in the Catholic newspaper
People's Democracy that Tomasek is among the ``noble people of our
times.''
   A day earlier, Communist Party leader Milos Jakes congratulated
Tomasek but asked him to support socialist goals in Czechoslovakia.
   Dissident playwright Vaclav Havel and Alexander Dubcek, the
Communist Party leader during the failed 1968 ``Prague Spring''
reform period, also wished the cardinal well.
   Havel met with Tomasek on Thursday and Dubcek visited the
cardinal on Wednesday, according to activist sources.
   Tomasek advocates less state supervision of church affairs in
this rigidly controlled communist nation, and his often daring
comments on the topic have made him a symbol of hope among Catholics.
   ``The state must eventually accept and respect the public
expression of the religious faithful,'' Tomasek said in an interview
with the West German newspaper Die Welt published on June 18.
   In the same interview, Tomasek complained the study of theology
in Czechoslovakia is ``burdened with difficulty.''
   Communist officials frequently crack down on political human
rights activists if they go too far with their public statements,
but they have tolerated Tomasek because of his religious leadership.
   The latest hint of a impending political crackdown came Friday
when the Communist Party newspaper Rude Pravo responded to a
petition by Czechoslovak activists to allow peaceful demonstrations,
free all political prisoners and reassess the 1968 Soviet-led
invasion that crushed Dubcek's reforms.
   Rude Pravo told the activists: ``Patience has its limits.''
   Tomasek became a bishop in 1949, and two years later was arrested
and interned during a communist crackdown on religious practice. He
was freed in 1954.
   He was named cardinal in June 1977 and archbishop of Prague that
December.
   A Mass was scheduled Saturday at Prague's St. Vitus Cathedral to
celebrate Tomasek's birthday. The cardinal was expected to deliver a
short address.
   Dozens of foreign dignitaries and high-ranking chuch officials
from other countries as well as thousands of Czechoslovaks were
expected at the ceremony.
   Church officials say about half of the 15 million people in
Czechoslovakia, officially an atheist state, are Catholics.

   A Fourth of July fascination with bangs, booms
and sparkles has Southern California authorities on edge as a
worsening drought kicks in an early wildfire season.
   ``The problem we have this year is that we've reached the
critical stage right before July Fourth and it's hard to keep people
from bringing in the fireworks,'' said Terry Molzahn of the U.S.
Forest Service.
   Flames crackling through tinder-dry brush in mountains near Lake
Elsinore, 60 miles southeast of Los Angeles, and the Antelope Valley
briefly forced thousands of residents to flee infernos in recent
days.
   The fires have blackened about 10,000 acres and have destroyed
eight homes. The largest blaze, near Lake Elsinore, was reported 90
percent contained by this morning, and firefighters hoped to
surround it completely by later today.
   ``With the amount of dead material or die-back we have and the
moisture content of the brush, we are today where we should be at
the end of August,'' said Los Angeles City Fire Battalion Chief Bob
Neamy.
   Rangers in the 647,000-acre Angeles National Forest will be
stopping all vehicles entering the forest this holiday weekend to
check for fireworks, said U.S. Forest Service spokesman George A.
Roby.
   Some cities permit the sale and use of so-called ``safe and
sane'' fireworks, which include sparklers and other non-explosives.
It's the illegal fireworks, most smuggled in from Mexico, that alarm
firefighters.
   ``We don't recommend any type of fireworks use for the public,''
said Neamy, whose department recommends attending one of the many
fireworks presentations in parks, stadiums and along the coast.
   ``We don't want to take apple pie and the American flag away. We
don't think fireworks are bad if they are conducted by professionals
in a show,'' said city fire spokesman Gary Svider.
   All fireworks, including the type that exploded Tuesday in a
Koreatown apartment and injured several police officers, have been
forbidden in Los Angeles since 1942.
   Firecrackers, skyrockets and other aerial displays are prohibited
in California, the only exception occurring during the Chinese New
Year when Chinese business associations are allowed to set off
firecrackers in ethnic and religious celebrations.
   Last year, illegal fireworks were responsible for 146 fires and
59 injuries in Los Angeles.
   In Santa Monica, the annual July Fourth celebration was changed
to the early morning hours several years ago because nighttime
street gang fights marred the festivities.
   ``We hope they will be too sleepy to cause too much trouble,''
said Sharon Rose of the city arts commission.
   In the 8,200-acre Lake Elsinore blaze, 11 cabins and homes,
counting mobile homes, were destroyed. Authorities said much
progress was made Thursday in fighting the man-made fire. An
investigation was under way to determine if the fire was arson.
   ``We got a super day in today getting a line around this,''
Barton Ball of the U.S. Forest Service said late Thursday.
``Everybody is back in their homes.''
   Ball said, though, the burned areas were a ghastly sight. ``It
looks like something from outer space out there,'' he said.
   In the Antelope Valley 45 miles north of Los Angeles, meanwhile,
firefighters declared that 2,250-acre blaze contained Thursday at 6
p.m.

<TEXT>
   A team of French business students embarked today
on an attempt to windsurf across the Atlantic Ocean, leaving
Manhattan for La Rochelle on the coast of France.
   Arnaud Crussol, 21, stood up on his board in the East River at
12:10 p.m. and immediately caught a breeze that propelled him toward
New York Harbor and the first leg of the month-long journey.
   Just minutes into the trip, he momentarily dropped his sail as a
huge barge steamed by, rocking the board and an accompanying
catamaran.
   ``We've been dreaming of leaving New York City from the bay,''
Crussol said before departing. ``It's a sunny day, there's a wind, a
good direction wind. So everything is OK.''
   He is one of four windsurfers who will take four-hour shirts
sailing across the Atlantic while a crew of five keeps an eye on
them from the catamaran.
   ``You ask why?'' says windsurfer Beatrice Noel. ``Because it's a
great adventure. This is something you can do when you're 22, and
maybe later, you don't have the time.''
   In all, nine second-year students at the Institut Superieur du
Commerce in Paris are participating in the unusual summer project.
   ``This teaches you responsibility on how to put together a
package, to get sponsors, to work together, the struggle of life,''
laughed Phillippe Pauliac, 22, as he helped with last-minute
preparations at Manhattan's South Street Seaport on Thursday for
what the group expects will be a one-month journey.
   Another windsurfer, Beatrice Comby, 21, says her parents at first
couldn't believe her summer vacation plans.
   ``But now they know we are well prepared. We have been practicing
hard,'' Comby said, noting that the team's four windsurfers have
worked out for more than a year and windsurfed in the English
Channel and the Mediterranean Sea.
   The plan calls for each of the four windsurfers to sail daily
four-hour shifts.
   Trailing them will be a high-tech, 40-foot fiberglass catamaran
skippered by Laurent Jandet and crewed by four other students. When
not in the water, the surfers will rest and sleep on the boat, which
is equipped with a fascimile machine to receive weather maps and a
desalination machine to produce potable water.
   The school each year encourages a summer project unrelated to its
business curriculum. Last year, another group of second-year
students crossed Australia in four-wheel vehicles. Next year's group
already is putting together a trek across the Andes Mountains.
   Programs like these cost a lot of francs. That's where the
students' business skills come in as they have to secure their own
corporate sponsors. This year's sponsors include a French bank, a
food company, a radio station and windsurfing and wetsuit companies.
   The windsurfing project was dreamed up last year by Jandet, the
22-year-old skipper.
   Asked why, Jandet talked about the lure of the ocean and the
adventure of a challenge until one of his four boat crew members
interrupted and said, ``Naw, he's just a little crazy.''

   Fifteen states will be able to begin programs
on Saturday to help poor families get off welfare and become
self-sufficient by requiring aid recipients to participate in
education, job training and work programs.
   The Department of Health and Human Services said Friday it has
approved the plans of these states, which will be the first to
implement the Job Opportunity and Basic Skills training program.
   JOBS, as it is known, is a $3.3 billion, five-year initiative
that is the centerpiece of a welfare overhaul passed by Congress
last year.
   The states are Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Georgia, Iowa,
Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey,
Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island and Wisconsin.
   All states must implement a JOBS program by Oct. 1, 1990.
   The legislation and regulations proposed by HHS in April allow
each state to design its own program within broad federal
guidelines. HHS must approve a state's JOBS plan before it can be
put into effect and receive federal money.
   Under the guidelines, one parent in two-parent welfare families
will have to work at least 16 hours a week in the public or private
sector as a condition for receiving benefits. Also, single welfare
parents with children 3 years and older will have to participate in
employment and training programs, and teen-age parents who have not
completed high school will have to return to school or work toward
an equivalent diploma.
   States also have to guarantee child care for parents who
participate in JOBS programs.
   States will have to bring 7 percent of their caseload in Aid to
Families with Dependent Children programs under the new plan
initially and 20 percent by 1994.

<HEAD>U.S., African Doctors Agree to Cooperate, Differ on South Africa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors from Africa and the United States
agreed Friday to cooperate but differed over whether their South
African colleagues should be included.
   The cooperation plan was adopted by representatives of the
Confederation of African Medical Associations and Societies, the
American Medical Association, the American Orthopedics Association,
and the International Society on Hypertension in Blacks, Inc., of
Atlanta.
   Doctors from 26 nations are attending the five-day conference on
hypertension among blacks that ends Saturday.
   James W. Reed, director of public affair for the hypertension
group, said the physicians would share ideas, hold exchanges for
doctors and medical students, and assist each other in training.
   African physicians' contacts with their U.S. counterparts are
primarily through their respective governments.
   ``We think such exchanges would improve the standard of medicine
in this continent and also may pave ways for more resources (from
the United States), which is vital for Africa,'' said Reed, of
Seattle.
   Ray Gifford of Cleveland, a member of the AMA board, said
cooperation between African medical associations and their American
counterparts would improve medical care in both regions.
   ``I think contacts would benefit both American and African
physicians to broaden their perspectives,'' said Gifford, the AMA's
official representative at the conference. ``We can learn from them
and they can learn from us and that way medical care would improve.''
   He reiterated the AMA position that South African physicians
should not be isolated.
   ``The American Medical Association abhors apartheid,'' Gifford
said. ``We do not agree with what the South Africans are doing. But
isolating South African doctors ... is bad for medicine.''
   O.O. Adenkule of Nigeria, secretary-general of the 30-nation
Confederation of African Medical Associations and Societies,
disagreed with the AMA's stand.
   ``We do not feel it is proper to deal with doctors who have not
shown any concern for the inhumane conditions under which South
Africa blacks live,'' he said.
   The confederation was formed in 1982 after African medical
associations quit the World Medical Association to protest South
Africa's membership.

<HEAD>Biggest American Delegation Ever Visits North Korea</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A South Korean woman defied a ban
by her government and arrived Friday for a youth festival, which
also drew the biggest U.S. delegation ever to isolated North Korea.
   In Seoul, about 4,000 riot police firing tear gas stormed a
university as more radical students prepared to defy the ban and
march to the World Festival of Youth and Students, North Korea's
first major interntional event.
   About 90 Americans are among the 12,000 people participating in
the festival, which begins Saturday with ceremonies in a new
150,000-seat stadium and ends on July 8.
   ``We're mostly progressive youths, liberals, Socialists and
Communists,'' said Seth Godfrey, a delegation leader from New Haven,
Conn.
   The festival brings together people mostly from socialist
countries for art exhibitions, songfests, plays and discussions on
``anti-imperialist'' themes.
   ``The point is to have a lot of discussions, to express our
viewpoints and listen to theirs,'' said Godfrey, 31-year-old
librarian.
   On June 25, North Korea began its annual anti-United States month
with a rally of 200,000 people in Pyongyang. North Korean troops
fought against U.S. soldiers in the 1950-53 Korean war, and the
communist nation says the presence of 43,000 U.S. troops in South
Korea is a major obstacle to reunification.
   But the government has opened its doors to Americans, including
about a dozen journalists, for the festival, North Korea's attempt
to show that it can stage an international event equivalent to the
Seoul Olympics.
   Godfrey said that among the U.S. groups represented are the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the Georgia Black Students
Association and the Young Communist League.
   The only South Korean to attend was Im Suk-yong, a 20-year-old
French major from Hankook University of Foreign Studies in Seoul.
   ``I'm very sorry to be taking part in the Pyongyang festival
alone,'' she said at the airport. ``This shows that the South Korean
government is anti-reunification.''
   She ended her brief speech by shouting, ``One million youth and
students of South Korea, I have arrived in Pyongyang! ... Long live
the struggle for reunification of the fatherland!''
   Miss Im said she traveled via Japan, West Germany and Moscow.
   Seoul has accused North Korea of using the festival to stir up
radical movements in South Korea.
   South Korean intelligence authorities said Ms. Lim would be
arrested and charged with national security violations when she
returns home. The prosecutor general's office ordered an
investigation into the funding and arrangements for her trip.
   South Korea's National Police Headquarters said about 50 students
were arrested Friday after trying to pass checkpoints leading to the
demilitarized zone that divides the peninsula.
   The two nations have been technically at war since North Korea
invaded South Korea in 1950 and started the Korean war.
   The confrontation between students and police in Seoul began with
the biggest police assault on a college campus since President Roh
Tae-woo came to power 18 months ago.
   Students fled the surprise attack on Hanyang University coughing
and vomitting as tear gas filled the air. Some fought back with
steel bars, clubs, rocks and firebombs.
   Authorities said about 600 students were arrested. About 100
students and police were injured, some seriously.
   By nightfall, hundreds of students were barricaded in four
buildings ringed by police. The campus was littered with rocks,
clubs, tree limbs, broken chairs and lumber.
   The youth festival, the 13th since 1947, follows one held in
Moscow in 1985.
   ``It's the first time ever in Asia, so we prepared very, very
hard,'' said official Kim Taesop.
   Pyongyang, a city of 2 million people, was awash with newly
planted flowers, flags and banners reading, ``Let the world youth
and students unite firmly under the banner of anti-imperialist
solidarity, peace and friendship.''
   As foreigners drove from the airport, many citizens walking along
the road and at bus stops smiled and waved.
   Many of the buildings being used to house participants and stage
events were constructed when North Korea sought to be a co-host of
the Seoul Olympics. Seoul proposed that various events be staged in
North Korea, but Pyongyang was dissatisfied with the offer and
boycotted the games.

   The remnants of Tropical Storm Allison continued to deluge
Louisiana and eastern Texas with heavy rain today.
   In southeast Texas, many streams and bayous were swollen or
flooded. Additional gates had to be opened at a dam along the Neches
River in Tyler County, and flooding occurred over parts of southern
Hardin County.
   Flash flood watches were in effect today over parts of eastern
Texas and southwest and west-central Louisiana.
   In Port Arthur, on the Texas Gulf Coast near the Louisiana line,
3 inches of rain fell this morning, bringing the June total in the
city to 17.5 inches and breaking the record of 15.04 inches set in
June 1942.
   Some street flooding was reported this morning in Port Arthur and
nearby Beaumont and residents were advised not to travel unless
absolutely necessary.
   Farther north, in Polk County, heavy rains left part of U.S.
Highway 59 under water today.
   In northern Louisiana, a third consecutive night of virtually
non-stop showers increased Winn Parish's total rainfall to nearly 2
feet over 72 hours. Residents who evacuated Thursday morning
returned to their homes later to gather belongings, but most were
back in the Winn Parish Courthouse when the floodwaters returned
Thursday night.
   In Winnfield, Mayor Max Kelley said about 40 homes and businesses
were flooded and many streets were impassable.
   In southern Louisiana, flooding also was reported in some
sections of St. Landry Parish, and nearly 6 inches of rain fell in
2{ hours around Covington.
   A thunderstorm Thursday in Ellisville, Miss., was blamed for the
partial collapse of the roof of a Jones County Junior College
recreation building. Five students were injured, one seriously.
   Elsewhere, strong thunderstorms developed across western portions
of the central and southern Plains. Storms extended from eastern New
Mexico across eastern Colorado into western Kansas and central
Nebraska.
   About 15 people evacuated from homes in Atwood, in northwest
Kansas, were expected to return home today as flooding receded in
rain-swollen Beaver Creek.
   In eastern Colorado, winds were reported to have gusted to 130
mph from a thunderstorm that dumped 2\ inches of rain in a half hour
and dropped golf ball-size hail south of Cheyenne Wells. A tornado
touched down near Eads.
   Thunderstorms over Minnesota produced nickel-size hail at Grand
Rapids and dime-size hail at Deep River.
   Thunderstorms also brought locally heavy rains to the southern
Atlantic Coast and the Florida Peninsula. Showers were scattered
ahead of a cold front along the northern and central Pacific Coast.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 a.m. EDT
included 1.5 inches at Clovis, N.M., and nearly an inch at Hibbing,
Minn., and Akron, Colo.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms over the
southern Atlantic Coast, Florida, the lower Mississippi Valley,
southeast Oklahoma and eastern Texas; and scattered showers and
thunderstorms across eastern Minnesota and northwest Wisconsin and
from the northern Rockies to the northern Pacific Coast.
   Highs were expected to be in the 60s and 70s in much of the
northern and middle Atlantic Coast, the northern Appalachians, the
upper Ohio Valley, the Great Lakes, eastern parts of the upper
Mississippi Valley and the Pacific Northwest; in the 90s in the
eastern Gulf Coast, Florida, the northern Plains, the Rockies and
southwest and south-central Texas; in the 100s from the Desert
Southwest to the Rio Grande Valley of Texas; and in the 80s
elsewhere.
   Temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 40 degrees at Bradford,
Pa., to 97 degrees at Phoenix.

   No one will ever know why a pet cat mauled
an 8-year-old girl in a series of attacks that were finally stopped
when two men wrestled the animal to the ground and strangled it, an
official said Friday.
   ``I would say it's certainly going to be a mystery forever,''
said microbiologist Julie Crosby, at the Department of Human
Services laboratory in Augusta. ``The only thing we can say is it
was negative for rabies.''
   ``Sometimes cats just go nuts,'' said the lab's Dr. Philip
Haines. ``Maybe somebody pulled its tail.''
   Haines said the 3-year-old cat, Gypsy, could have gone crazy
because of other ailments including distemper, a brain tumor or an
infection, but the lab tested the cat only for rabies.
   On Monday, Gypsy attacked Amy Johnson several times, clawing a
1-inch gash above her right eye that required four stitches. Amy's
father, Mike Johnson, came to the rescue by striking the cat with a
mop handle.
   The family was finally driven from its home for several hours.
Upon their return, the cat attacked the girl again, so Johnson
called police.
   When patrolman Gary Berg arrived, the two men got the biting and
scratching cat to the floor and Johnson strangled it.
   ``I was tired and the cat was freaking out and both of us were
getting sliced and diced,'' Johnson said at the time. ``I was afraid
if I let her go she would kill me. She had an evil look on her
face.''

   U.S. Ambassador Melissa Wells signed an
agreement Friday to provide a $400,000 grant for a project to reduce
infant and child mortality in a province hit by frequent rebel
attacks.
   Mozambique's infant and child mortality rates are among the
highest in the world. UNICEF estimates that 325 to 375 of every
1,000 Mozambican children die before their fifth birthday, mostly
because of a 12-year guerrilla war in which crops are burned,
villages destroyed and convoys of trucks carrying relief aid
attacked by guerrillas of the Mozambican National Resistance.
   Mrs. Wells said after signing the agreement with Cooperation
Minister Jacinto Veloso that the document ``marks what we believe
will be a fruitful collaboration between the United States and
Mozambique in adressing anew the serious child health problems
throughout Mozambique.''
   The project will be undertaken in four districts of central
Zambezia province and will also involve three non-governmental
organizations that already have programs there: Doctors Without
Borders, the Save the Children Fund, and World Vision.

   The records of those imprisoned will be cleared and all those

<HEAD>Couple Gets Probation in Child's Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A couple convicted of killing a diabetic
daughter by withholding medical aid on religious grounds were placed
on probation Friday and ordered to get a doctor for their other
children.
   William and Christine Hermanson were convicted in April of
third-degree murder and felony child abuse in the 1986 death of
their daughter Amy, 7, from untreated juvenile diabetes.
   Circuit Judge Stephen Dakan gave them four-year suspended
sentences and placed them on 15 years probation with the stipulation
that they take their other two children, sons ages 1 and 11, to
physicians for regular checkups and have them treated medically when
necessary.
   The couple could have been sentenced to up to seven years in
prison.
   Hermanson, a 42-year-old former banker and his 38-year-old wife,
a music school operator, said they will appeal the conviction and
sentence.
   Christian Science doctrine relies on prayer and spiritual
practitioners instead of doctors to treat illness, but does not
impose sanctions on followers who seek medical aid. Amy died three
years ago, after her parents depended on prayer and spiritual
healing instead of traditional medicine.
   ``We loved Amy very much and still do,'' Hermanson said in court.
``Even those who condemned us loved Amy.''
   His wife tearfully told the judge: ``I'm just having a very
difficult time understanding a justice system that has let us go
this far and brought us to the point where we're standing in front
of you with a conviction when our family and our children are the
absolute center of our activities.''
   The Hermansons originally turned down a state offer of 15 years
probation for a guilty or no-contest plea to child abuse. The murder
charge would have been dropped. They refused, saying they wanted a
chance to defend their actions.
   The defense argued the couple were protected by a state law that
says parents who withhold medical care in the legitimate practice of
their religion can't be considered abusive. The jury disagreed.
   According to trial testimony, a Christian Science nurse at Amy's
bedside finally summoned an ambulance but it was too late to save
the child.
   Before sentencing, defense attorneys filed a memorandum with the
court in support of probation.
   The defendants ``acted without any intent to do harm, but were
merely following what they thought was a lawful and effective method
of treating their child,'' the memo stated.
   The U.S. Supreme Court has refused to hear two appeals within the
last year from parents whose children died after medical treatment
was withheld for religious reasons.

<HEAD>USDA Says at Least One Out of Every Three Chickens Contaminated</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department says at least one
out of every three chickens headed for consumer tables is
contaminated by salmonella bacteria, tiny organisms that can cause
food poisoning.
   As every competent hunter knows to treat every gun as if it is
loaded, so consumers should be wary about chickens being carriers of
salmonella.
   Some consumer advocates say the contamination rate is much higher
than the levels acknowledged by USDA. Those critics say one in two
birds is fouled by salmonella and that in some particularly dirty
plants nine out of 10 are tainted.
   There's no way for the shopper to tell by looking at labels or
the overall appearance of chickens as they are presented at food
counters. And don't bet on kosher chickens being safer.
   USDA experts say there is ``no valid scientific information''
showing that kosher chickens carry more or fewer salmonella bacteria
than other poultry.
   Rod Leonard of the private, non-profit Community Nutrition
Institute based in Washington says USDA's inspection procedures have
become so bad that people shouldn't eat chicken. But if you do, he
says, handle them with care.
   The department's Food Safety and Inspection Service rejects
Leonard's advice about avoiding chicken and says American consumers
have the best food supply in the world.
   But the FSIS goes along wholeheartedly with Leonard's second bit
of advice, to handle poultry with care. Red meat, too, for that
matter.
   One of the problems is that in many plants chickens free of
salmonella are mixed in with some that are infected. Fecal matter,
spread through the slaughter and evisceration process, is the
carrier.
   So, when mixed batches of chickens are washed together, there is
a good chance of all being contaminated by salmonella bacteria.
Tests by FSIS show that on a national scale 35 percent to 37 percent
of the nation's broilers are contaminated, a level the agency says
has been fairly constant for almost 20 years.
   At least 40,000 salmonella infections are reported each year, but
experts believe that between 400,000 and 4 million people annually
contract salmonella food poisoning. Cases can range from extremely
mild to severe.
   Most infected people get diarrhea, and many have upset stomachs,
chills, fever or headache. The disease usually runs its course in
three to five days, and many believe they have the flu and never see
a doctor.
   Salmonella infections can be life-threatening for the very young,
the very old and for people who already have been weakened by other
diseases. It is believed that about 500 people a year die from
salmonella poisoning.
   The FSIS says it is ``economically impossible'' to produce raw
poultry and red meat free of salmonella. Here are some tips by the
agency:
   _Wash hands frequently with soap and water before and after food
preparation.
   _Never let raw meat and poultry, or their juices, come in contact
with cooked meat or other food, raw or cooked.
   _If a dishcloth is used for cleaning kitchen surfaces, switch to
a clean one after working with raw meat or poultry. Otherwise, use
paper towels.
   _Cut raw meat or poultry on an acrylic cutting board that is
thoroughly cleaned after each use. That favorite wooden board should
be used only for cutting bread and vegetables.
   _Salmonella bacteria ``do not survive when beef or pork is cooked
to an internal temperature of at least 160 degrees Fahrenheit, or
when poultry is cooked to 185 degrees.'' So cook thoroughly.

<HEAD>Hanae Mori's 35th Anniversary Exhibition a Restrospective on Beauty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE KURTENBACH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hanae Mori kicked off her 35th anniversary
exhibition Friday with a parade of most-loved creations celebrating
her sense of beauty and elegance.
   The show previewing an exhibition of the works of Asia's only
designer of haute couture was held in the Hanae Mori building in
Tokyo's swank Omotesando district.
   Many of her 85 favorite creations, ranging from her colorful
Japanese ``happi'' suits of 1981 to her 1989 ``Wave and Butterfly''
dress in silk, carried her colorful trademark.
   The show included only one outfit from the 1960s: a butterfly
dress from her 1968 New York collection presented three years after
the Japanese designer brought her ``pret-a-couture'' line to the
United States.
   She has continued to create the soft and flowing chiffons and
silky butterfly-flower prints that won favor with American
customers, while exploring a wide range of silhouettes and fabrics
in Paris.
   The show and exhibition, which opens July 4, are a rare
retrospective for Mrs. Mori, who said in a recent speech here that
she thought it was ``about time I looked back at my own footsteps.''
   ``I've been doing some philosophical soul-searching about what
fashion is,'' she said. ``Apparel wraps the human drama as it
develops.''
   That drama, she said, is the mystery and allure of how men and
women interact.
   ``As I look back ... I have come to feel that people, especially
women, have changed a great deal,'' she said.
   Mrs. Mori's marriage of Eastern fabrics and tradition, with their
suggestion of hidden beauty, and the Western couturiere's sense of
striking individual beauty, however, seem timeless.
   Unlike avant-garde Japanese designers Issey Miyake and Yohji
Yamamoto, Mori dresses always are classically feminine.
   Mrs. Mori's fabrics always have been sumptuous: silks, rich wools
and glittering sequins. Regal brocades recall more courtly eras.
   Three ballerinas danced through the runway wearing short tafetta
and chiffon ball gowns of 1986: a slinky ``rose ensemble'' from 1977
and flirty ``daisy dresses'' from 1988, all shapely and romantic,
not shocking.
   Mrs. Mori's elegant designs are worn by the wives of Japanese
prime ministers and even Empress Michiko.
   The 1970s, ``an era that wasn't for making women beautiful,''
didn't appeal much to Mrs. Mori. ``Women were not at their best in
terms of beauty,'' she said.
   The 1980s suit her better. ``Nowadays, health and nature is
beautiful,'' she said. ``After all, I'm Japanese ... I like things
fragile and effervescent.''
   Despite her restrospective, Mrs. Mori says looking forward comes
more naturally to her.
   ``I rarely look at the past,'' she said. ``The nature of my work
is to anticipate how people will live in the world to come and stay
a step ahead.
   ``Sometimes I want to make something, but it's too early. So I
put it back in my treasure chest and wait for the right time.''

   Mayor Jacques Chirac has rejected plans for an
anti-aircraft battery to protect visiting leaders during
bicentennial celebrations, although the City of Light will be
sprouting submachine guns and missiles.
   The display of firepower is piquing the people celebrating 200
years of liberty, equality and fraternity.
   Critics say the security dragnet _ to be enforced during a
meeting of the world's seven richest countries at the same time _
might be better suited for kings.
   ``The Bicentennial of the Rich,'' said the Communist Party
newspaper L'Humanite in a headline this week.
   The elaborate arrangements all but ignore 30 other heads of state
from Latin America, Africa and Asia, so a group including French pop
singer Renaud is organizing a ``countersummit of the poor'' on July
8.
   ``Any resemblance between the commemoration of the bicentennial
of the French Revolution and a great popular celebration is becoming
more remote each day,'' the conservative tabloid Le Quotidien de
Paris said this week, following the disclosure of a plan to install
double-barreled 20mm guns on a bridge over the Seine.
   ``Two centuries ago, the Paris mob freed the last prisoners from
the Bastille. On July 14, the descendants of this same crowd will be
under lock and key,'' the newspaper said.
   Chirac urged the Defense Ministry to find someplace else for the
anti-aircraft battery. Mirage jetfighters and Crotale missiles still
will back up more than 30,000 policemen and soldiers on patrol from
July 12-17, according to air force spokesman Col. Serge Lenne.
   Under the security plan, parts of central Paris will be closed to
most vehicles. The Louvre Museum is to be closed for three days, and
tourist boats forbidden to ply the Seine.
   Six radar systems will be added to the four permanently installed
around Paris, infra-red cameras for night viewing will be mounted on
high altitude sites and a dirigible will float in the city sky.
   ``We all know that power makes you mad,'' opposition politician
Jacques Toubon said in a jab at Socialist President Francois
Mitterrand. Toubon is mayor of the 13th district where the Tolbiac
Bridge is located.
   Gen. Yves Aubert's plan to turn the Tolbiac Bridge into a
military zone for a week beginning July 10 was aimed at deterring
any hostile planes penetrating the city via the Seine, Lenne said.
   ``The air force is currently looking for another site,'' Lenne
said, adding it would likely be inside Paris.
   The security arrangements have produced tongue-in-cheek jibes.
   ``Maybe I'm not a chief of state of one of the richest countries
in the world,'' wrote Le Monde satirist Claude Sarraute, ``but I'm
the head of a developing family and I was fearing for my security''
with all the fighting in subway stations and ``deadly words received
in the middle of a traffic jam.''
   The Paris Greens, an environmentalist party, on Wednesday asked
Defense Minister Pierre Chevenement to take measures ``dignified of
the nation: a nuclear submarine under the Alma Bridge, Pluton
missiles at the Ile de la Cite and fighter planes in Montmartre.''

   Jiang Mian, the son of new Chinese party
chief Jiang Zemin, lives in a modest brick row house near the campus
of Drexel University, fiercely guarding his privacy as a graduate
student in engineering.
   In a brief telephone interview Thursday, he said he hopes to
complete a doctorate in electrical and computer engineering. He
would not discuss his future.
   He has been at Drexel since 1986 and has shied away from
publicity, although many other Chinese students at Drexel and nearby
campuses have participated in rallies and demonstrations since the
Beijing student demonstrations began.
   He has rejected other interview requests, according to university
officials. He would not agree to an interview in person or to be
photographed.
   ``I really don't want to talk about myself and my father and my
family, so I really hope you can understand my situation,'' Jiang
said.
   ``Of course, you have your freedom to write anything. But in
terms of my situation, I don't want to be popular in the public. And
that's my feeling.''
   He politely, but firmly, declined to answer further questions.
   Jiang Zemin, 62, was named Saturday as general secretary of the
47-million-member Communist Party of China. He replaced Zhao Ziyang,
who was ousted in disgrace for expressing sympathy for the
pro-democracy movement.
   He is considered an economic moderate who supports the hard
political line of senior leader Deng Xiaoping and Premier Li Peng.
   U.S. diplomatic sources in China say Jiang Zemin reportedly has
two other sons, one of whom may be studying in California and
another in West Germany.
   Jiang Mian refused to discuss any other members of his family.
   Bruce Eisenstein, chairman of the electrical and computer
engineering department, described Jiang Mian as a good student who
wanted to maintain a low profile.
   Beyond that, Eisenstein would say little, citing a policy of
keeping student records private.
   Drexel's president, Richard D. Breslin, and many professors and
students have been outspoken in their criticism of the Chinese
leadership after the June 3-4 attack on pro-democracy protesters in
Beijing.
   The government says 200 to 300 people, most of them soldiers,
died in the confrontation. Chinese witnesses and Western
intelligence reports say most of the dead were civilians and the
toll was as high as 3,000.
   Breslin announced June 6 the university would rescind plans to
confer an honorary degree on Chinese Vice Premier Tian Jiyun,
considered a reformist like Zhao.
   At commencement June 10, Breslin wore a white armband and called
for a moment of silence in honor of the students who died in
Tiananmen Square and surrounding streets.
   Drexel is an independent university with 12,300 students,
including more than 1,000 international students from 88 countries.
   Jiang Zemin, an engineer himself for many years, had been party
secretary of Shanghai, China's largest city, and a member of the
17-member Politburo, the party's top decision-making body.
   From 1985 until last year, he was mayor of Shanghai, aggressively
promoting it as a financial and foreign investment center and
tackling transportation and housing problems in the city of 12
million people.

<HEAD>Index Drops to Lowest Level in Three Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An index measuring the ability of the typical
American family to buy a home fell in May to its lowest level in
three years, primarily because of increases in mortgage rates, the
National Association of Realtors reported Friday.
   The real estate trade group said its affordability index was at
100.1 last month, down from 103.2 in April and the lowest since May
1986 when it measured 99.8.
   May's index level meant that a family earning the median income
of $32,644 annually had 0.1 percent more income than needed to
qualify for a mortgage covering 80 percent of the purchase price of
a median-priced home.
   The median price for an existing home in May was $93,100, meaning
half the homes sold for more and half for less. May's median price
was up $200 from April's $92,900.
   The mortgage rate used to calculate the index rose to 10.46
percent from 10.08 percent in April. The rate represents a composite
of fixed and adjustable rates.
   The Realtors group predicts better housing affordability
conditions as adjustable rates follow the fixed rates' downward
trend.
   ``Overall, it looks as though the typical buyer has passed the
low point in housing affordability for the year,'' said NAR
President Ira Gribin.

   Actor Don Johnson denied accusations that
someone at his wedding to actress Melanie Griffith opened fire with
a shotgun on a helicopter carrying a tabloid reporter and
photographer.
   ``The thought that any member of Don's party would attempt to
bring down a chopper over the vicinity of his own guests is
ridiculous,'' Johnson spokesman Elliot Mintz said Thursday.
   The Star reporter Barry Levine said the craft came under fire as
it circled a ranch eight miles west of Aspen, Colo., during Monday's
private ceremony.
   Local and federal authorities said the helicopter was hit by what
appeared to be buckshot, usually fired by skeet shooters.
   Mintz acknowledged that some guests were shooting skeet before
the wedding, but he said the control tower at Aspen Airport was
alerted to that.
   Levine, 30, and photographer Ross Truiak, 44, were slightly
wounded, apparently by buckshot, said Tom Stephenson, sheriff's
deputy in Pitkin County, Colo. ``A number of shotgun pellets have
been found within the cockpit of the helicopter.''
   And Pitkin County Sheriff Bob Braudis said Thursday that
investigators doubt there was a serious attempt to shoot down the
helicopter. He said there is little chance the person firing the
shots ever will be identified.

   Actor Omar Sharif finished out of the money in a
bridge tournament bearing his name, but it wasn't as unpleasant an
experience as a previous visit to Dallas.
   When he was in the city for a 1970 bridge tournament, a drunken
woman came to his hotel room after 3 a.m. and ordered him to make
love to her, The Dallas Morning News reported Friday.
   ``She opened her purse, took out a gun and pointed it at me,'' he
recalled.
   The actor demurred, explaining _ in so many words _ that
pistol-waving took the edge off his desire, he told the newspaper.
   ``Maybe if you put the gun away...,'' he suggested.
   Sharif said the woman left in a huff.
   ``It was scary,'' he told a Morning News columnist during last
week's tournament. ``I'd rather be held up by a gangster than a
drunken woman who doesn't know what she's doing.''

   Celebrity attorney Marvin Mitchelson is
facing more misconduct charges from the bar association, which now
says he ducked customs duties on $1 million in jewels once belonging
to the Duchess of Windsor.
   The State Bar of California's Office of Trial Counsel filed
amended disciplinary charges Thursday against the Los Angeles
attorney.
   Mitchelson obtained the jewels at a Sotheby's auction in August
1987, according to the bar. The bar alleged earlier that Mitchelson
never paid Sotheby's for the jewels.
   A disciplinary trial is set for Aug. 14, and will include other
misconduct charges against Mitchelson alleging financial
improprieties in dealing with client's fees.
   Mitchelson has represented such star clients as Joan Collins and
Bianca Jagger in divorce cases and was the lawyer in the landmark
``palimony'' case brought by Michele Triola, the live-in girlfriend

   Singer Anne Murray could be the
motherlode of tourism for this economically depressed area of
northern Nova Scotia, if the new museum planned in her honor takes
off the way officials hope it will.
   The coal-mining town where the singer grew up is opening its $1.5
million Anne Murray Centre on July 28, with Mayor Bill Howard boldly
predicting that as many as 20,000 people could swarm into the
community of 4,500.
   ``I get cautious when I get too excited about what may come out
of this whole thing, but right now it's the best picture I've seen
for quite a number of years,'' Howard said.
   Murray, 44, best known for her 1970 hit ``Snowbird,'' will be on
hand to open the center, built with federal and provincial money on
land donated by the town.
   Her success in the American music industry _ more than 20 million
records sold, four Grammys and 11 gold albums _ is unmatched by any
other Canadian female solo artist. She has won 20 Canadian Juno
recording awards.
   Visitors to the center will be able to trace Murray's career
through displays of memorabilia and costumes from her tours and
television specials.
   The two-story building will have a staff of 23 and audio-visual
displays, featuring the singer in performance and interview
situations.

<TEXT>
   Communist Party leader Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski said today he does not intend to run for president, and
he endorsed Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak for the post,
state television announced.
   Jaruzelski made the announcement to a meeting of the party's
Central Committee, the report said. The meeting was to consider the
party's nominee for president. There had been indications someone
other than Jaruzelski would be chosen.
   As the meeting continued, anti-Jaruzelski demonstrators marched
in Warsaw's streets, hurling stones and Molotov cocktails at police
who responded with water cannons.
   ``I know well that public opinion associates me more often with
martial law and less often with the line of reforms _ with those so
significant decisions of the 10th plenum. I must take into
consideration social reality,'' Jaruzelski said.
   During the 10th plenum, in January, communist officials agreed in
principle to restore legal status to Solidarity, which had been
outlawed after the 1981 martial law crackdown.
   Jaruzelski said in an interview with The Associated Press on
Wednesday that he might not accept the presidency without support of
the Solidarity-led opposition.
   Solidarity-backed lawmakers in the National Assembly, which will
meet next week to elect a president, said they would vote against
Jaruzelski.
   Earlier, as the 230-member Central Committee convened, a
spokesman at the party's press office who asked not to be identified
said there was ``hearsay'' that Kiszczak would be nominated. But he
added: ``It is unofficial.''
   Kiszczak, a Jaruzelski loyalist, is a 63-year-old army general
who heads Poland's police apparatus and helped wage the government's
war against Solidarity for most of the 1980s.
   Despite that, he won the confidence of the Solidarity leadership
during negotiations that began last August during a national wave of
strikes.
   Like Jaruzelski, he threatened to step down during the January
plenum unless Solidarity's legal status was reinstated.
   He also led officials in negotiations with the opposition, which
ended in April with Solidarity being legalized. Thetalks also
cleared the way for elections earlier this month _ the country's
freest since World War II.
   In his statement, Jaruzelski described Kiszczak as ``the soldier,
politician, patriot and a man who has been close to me for many
years.''
   ``In the eyes of the society, including also opposition circles,
he is rightly considered as a leading representative of the line of
reconciliation.''
   Jaruzelski's name had been linked to the presidency since the
office was created as a result of the April agreement, but he
himself stressed Wednesday the need for someone who could have ``at
least a minimum of support'' from both sides.
   The president is to be the guarantor of the state, responsible
for the armed forces and for Poland's foreign alliances. The
president, who may serve two six-year terms, may also dissolve
Parliament in limited circumstances and declare one 90-day state of
emergency.
   On Thursday, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said: ``There are more
candidates for president than we think, and there are many
candidates on which both sides will agree.''
   Solidarity deputies and senators are to meet in Warsaw on
Saturday to debate the union's stance on the presidency. Solidarity
is not expected to put up its own candidate.
   Candidates backed by the labor union won 99 of 100 seats in the
newly created Senate and all 161 seats open to the opposition in the
460-member Sejm during voting in June. The remaining Sejm seats were
reserved for the communists and their allies, who control the
legislature.
   In the interview Wednesday, Jaruzelski said he is open to more
democratic reforms as long as they benefit society.
   He also said the Communist Party will not return to its monopoly
rule of the past.
   ``We have become convinced that monopoly is a very unhealthy
thing, not only in the economy, but also in political life,'' he
said.
   Wearing his familiar dark glasses and a traditional business
suit, Jaruzelski declared that his party's automatic leading role in
Poland ``already is history.''
   Asked how far democratization could go, he said, in a written
answer: ``The limits of the reforms are not rigid. The main issue is
their social purpose and effectiveness.''
   He said the economic and social changes have already put Poland
in the forefront of reforms in the East bloc.
   Asked about the whether he would be a presidential candidate,
Jaruzelski said that would depend on ``democratic'' consultations
within the party and added, ``I will also seriously consider the
stand of the opposition, understanding that the president,
especially in our conditions when we have to unite the nation's
efforts and build platforms of accord, should have at least a
minimum of support'' from all sides.
   ``I am a soldier, so I have a deep-rooted feeling of duty _ but
also of honor. I will not crawl to this post.''
   Jaruzelski said the communists fared poorly in the June 4 and
June 18 elections because voters have not yet realized how much the
party platform has changed in favor of democracy.

   Officers led by a paratroop corps
brigadier ousted the civilian government of Prime Minister Sadek
Mahdi in a bloodless coup Friday and assumed dictatorial powers.
   The officers leading the coup _ Sudan's fourth in 33 years _
suspended the constitution, declared a state of emergency and banned
independent newspapers, according to Egypt's Middle East News Agency.
   They warned they may punish violent opposition to the coup with
death, but promised non-partisan, non-racist government in the
nation divided by a southern war between dominant Moslem northerners
of Arab descent and a black Nubian minority of Christians and
animists.
   The war has cost the government a ruinous $1 million a day while
it ran up a foreign debt of $13 billion. Soaring inflation and
widespread consumer shortages caused food riots in Khartoum earlier
this year.
   The new rulers took power shortly after midnight, the news agency
said, and declared themselves a National Salvation Revolution
council under the chairmanship of Brig. Omar Hassan Ahmed Bashir. He
is the third-ranking officer in the paratroop corps.
   Bashir announced the coup on official Radio Omdurman and named
himself prime minister, defense minister and armed forces commander.
   He imposed an indefinite nighttime curfew on the dusty capital of
Africa's largest country, one-third the size of the continental
United States.
   Khartoum's airport and Sudan's airspace were closed. Soldiers
barricaded the bridges over the Blue Nile and White Nile, isolating
the three sections of the capital.
   There were conflicting reports about Mahdi's status. One said he
escaped arrest. Another said he was seen being driven from his home
by soldiers.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the U.S.
Embassy in Khartoum confirmed the coup.
   ``The military reportedly has arrested a number of Cabinet
members,'' said Ms. Tutwiler.
   ``We regret the military is taking action to overthrow Sudan's
democratically elected government, and we urge an early return to
democracy,'' she said. ``It is critical that whoever is in control
takes immediate steps to find a peaceful solution to the war and to
improve the provision of humanitarian relations.''
   Bashir is a veteran of the six-year southern war and cited
Mahdi's failure to end the conflict as a key reason for his
overthrow.
   But the coup's effect on a current peace initiative is unknown.
   In Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, where a new round of peace talks was to
start Tuesday, spokesman Edward Lino of the rebel Sudan People's
Liberation Army said it is premature to discuss the situation. He
said the rebels have not heard from Khartoum about Tuesday's talks.
   For months, the military has been restive about Mahdi's
reluctance to negotiate with the rebels.
   Last year, the army command reminded Mahdi that soldiers were
dying while the government vacillated. Army officers threatened to
move against him if Mahdi continued to delay. The United States and
other countries threatened to withhold aid for the same reason.
   Mahdi finally gave in, and peace talks began in May.
   Sudan's new rulers do not appear allied with army commanders who
forced Mahdi to capitulate.
   ``The coup leaders have designated the general command and army
leaders as `the former command,''' the Egyptian agency said,
indicating the paratroop and armored units that ousted Mahdi were
not from the top echelons of Sudan's military command.
   It is the fourth coup since Sudan proclaimed independence from an
Egyptian-British consortium on Jan. 1, 1956. The military has ruled
for 23 of the past 33 years.
   Gili Farah, a Sudan News Agency journalist, said there were no
reports of violence during or after the coup.
   Bashir said his takeover was neither partisan nor sectarian,
appearing to disavow any connection with the fundamentalist National
Islamic Front, Sudan's second-biggest party after Mahdi's, and
dictator Gaafar Nimeiri, who last week said he would regain power
soon.
   ``The National Salvation Revolution is a genuine Sudanese
revolution, the revolution of a people who rose up against tyranny,
corruption, partisanship and sectarianism,'' Bashir's statement said.
   ``It's a national revolution, neither leftist nor rightist, not
partisan, not Mayist, not racist.''
   ``Mayist'' refers to followers of Nimeiri, who seized power in a
May 25, 1969, coup and called his 16-year rule the ``May
Revolution.''
   Nimeiri was overthrown in April 1985 by a military council that
ruled for a year then surrendered power in April 1986 to Mahdi,
whose Umma Party won a parliamentary majority in military-organized
elections.
   Part of the Oxford-educated Mahdi's problem was that he is a
great-grandson of the Mahdi, whose fervent Moslem followers defeated
a British colonial force and brought brief independence to Sudan in
the late 1800s. The mantle of religious leadership caused him to
avoid decisions that may have been interpreted as anti-Moslem.
   One southern demand was the removal of harsh Islamic laws
introduced by Nimeiri and suspended by Mahdi earlier this year.
   Southern Sudanese want more autonomy and development in their
region, which is plagued by war-induced famine.

   Paul Kidwell would like to see Manfred
Mann replace Francis Scott Key as the man associated with the
national anthem.
   Kidwell has formed a group to promote replacing ``The
Star-Spangled Banner'' with ``Do Wah Diddy.''
   ``It's just one of my favorite songs. It was a real hard choice
between that and another of my favorites, `Mack the Knife,''' said
Kidwell, founder and self-appointed president of America, Change the
Anthem Now _ America CAN.
   Kidwell said the only good rendition he has ever heard of the
anthem was by Marvin Gaye at a basketball game.
   ``I don't like the song,'' Kidwell said of the notoriously
hard-to-sing anthem. ``It's stodgy, staid, not easy to dance to and,
frankly, may be the worst song ever written. I'd give it about a
35.''
   Kidwell, who works for a subliminal tapes manufacturer in Grand
Rapids, said he doesn't expect his suggestion to survive. ``After
all, the other piece has been around, what, 200 years? But that
doesn't mean I have to like the song,'' he said.
   ``Do Wah Diddy,'' made famous by Mann in 1964, ``embodies the
American dream. You know, boy meets girl, boy falls in love with
girl, boy gets girl,'' Kidwell said.
   ``Besides, we need something upbeat.''

   Try explaining to the Postal Service and the
telephone company that while you have a new address, you still live
in the same house.
   That's what Lowry Air Force Base residents faced when officials
began changing street names eight weeks ago to make military
addresses conform to the surrounding area.
   Base residents simply had to send change-of-address cards
supplied by the post office.
   Then they began receiving hefty installation charges for phones
and cable television subscriptions that had been in place for years.
   ``I can understand how that would happen,'' said Debbie Thomas, U
S West phone company spokeswoman. ``About 99.9 percent of the time,
when you have an address change on an account, the computers assume
that's a location change.''
   For some, the trouble didn't stop there. Neither did the postal
carrier.
   ``We need a good, solid address in order to deliver mail,'' said
Postal Service spokesman Scott Budny. ``In this case, there were so
many different ways of addressing the mail that the people who lived
at the address didn't know how to address their own mail.''
   To make matters worse, some of the new street names duplicated
names of streets in suburban Northglenn, Budny said. ``Our clerks
weren't used to a street named Rampart being on Lowry Air Force
Base.''
   About 2 percent of the mail to those families was marked ``Return
to Sender'' before problems were resolved.

   Syrian and Lebanese Christian gunners
exchanged barrages of artillery fire that killed two people Friday,
police said.
   An Arab initiative to halt the bloodshed won Kremlin suppport.
   Beirut police said Friday's fatalities were two of four people
wounded earlier in the day. The casualties raised the toll from 15
weeks of fighting to 382 killed and 1,499 wounded.
   Police said Syrian soldiers shelled a beach strip north of the
capital to maintain a blockade of the Christian enclave.
   Christian forces in the besieged 310-square-mile district
retaliated by firing at Syrian batteries along west Beirut's seaside
boulevard, police said.
   Aoun's headquarters said Christian gunners ``only responded by
shelling the sources of fire.''
   The Syrians have shelled the Christian coastline daily despite a
cease-fire called May 26 by an Arab League summit.
   Arab leaders then President Chadli Bendjedid of Algeria, King
Fahd of Saudi Arabia and King Hassan II of Morocco to negotiate a
settlement to Lebanon's crisis by November.
   The three leaders met Tuesday in Oran, Algeria, and called again
for a truce and lifting the siege trapping about 1 million
Christians.
   They also called on Lebanese legislators to meet outside the
country to negotiate a new power-sharing formula. Christians
traditionally have dominated Lebanese politics although Moslems
outnumber them by more than 2-1.
   Tass Soviet news agency Tass reported that President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev has promised to discuss the Lebanese crisis with Syria,
the main power-broker in the war-torn land, and Iraq, which is
arming Gen. Michel Aoun's mainly Christian Lebanese army. Both
countries have friendship treaties with Moscow.
   Gorbachev made the promise to Moroccan Foreign Minister Abdel
Latif Filali in Moscow on Thursday, Tass said.
   It quoted Gorbachev as saying he is ``prepared to hold regular
contacts with the (Arab) committee with the aim of speeding up
efforts to normalize the situation in Lebanon.''
   Foreign ministers of Algeria, Morocco and Saudi Arabia are to
visit Syria and Iraq when they complete missions to Washington,
Paris, London and Moscow to win support for the League plan to
resolve the 14-year war between Lebanese Christians and Moslems.
   Beirut's independent An-Nahar newspaper Friday quoted Aoun as
welcoming the Arab call.
   ``I welcome the Oran statement and await its implementation,'' he
said.
   Asked to comment on the proposal to convene parliament outside
Lebanon, Aoun said: ``The deputies are free to take whatever
decisions they want.'' Earlier, aides reported he opposed the idea.
   Christian legislators have said they could meet in Beirut if
Syria lifts the siege.
   Druse militiamen on March 14 began the siege that is being
enforced by their Syrian allies, who have taken sides in violation
of a 1976 League peacekeeping mandate.
   That came a week after Aoun blockaded illegal ports run by
Syrian-backed militias to try to reimpose state authority.
   Aoun has accepted Arab calls to lift his blockade. But the
Syrians have continued their bombardment to prevent Aoun receiving
supplies sent by Iraq, Syria's main Arab foe.
   Aoun has declared a ``war of liberation'' to drive Syrian troops
out of Lebanon. But Syria has 40,000 troops there and its Moslem and
Druse Lebanese allies can muster the same number of militiamen, way
outnumbering Aoun's 20,000-strong force.

<HEAD>Soviet Nuclear Subs Criticized as Poorly Built</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet nuclear submarines are poorly built and the
navy is covering up the problems, a veteran officer said in an
attack published Friday, after two recent sub accidents.
   Capt. Ilya B. Kolton, who served aboard Soviet submarines for 30
years, blames the navy leadership and defense construction industry
for carelessness and shoddy work that has cost sailors' lives.
   ``Construction deficiencies, plus imperfect crew rescue
equipment, plus the startling slowness and inertia of the naval
agencies in introducing new ideas _ such, in my opinion, is the
alarming formula of the recent emergencies and tragedies,'' said
Kolton, an atomic energy researcher who serves in the naval reserve.
   His criticism of the world's largest submarine fleet was
published in the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda, whose readers
include many young sailors and other members of the armed forces.
   Although official commissions are still investigating, Kolton
said the problems he cited were clearly behind the April 7 fire and
sinking of the experimental nuclear-armed and -powered submarine
Komsomolets, and Monday's accident aboard another nuclear-armed and
powered submarine.
   Forty-two sailors died in the Komsomolets accident off Norway. In
Monday's accident, also off Norway, a pipe burst in the cooling
system of a reactor aboard an Echo II-class sub. No one was hurt,
and the Soviets have said no radiation was leaked to the environment
in either accident.
   The military newspaper Red Star on Friday questioned whether the
Echo II-class sub, built in the 1960s, should still be in use. It
quoted Capt. Y. Magakov, acting head of the Northern Fleet's
technical department, as saying the navy was considering whether to
keep using subs of the same design as the one involved in Monday's
accident.
   In an introduction to Kolton's article, Komsomolskaya Pravda
noted the warships involved in the recent accidents had not been
shot at and added in a biting remark, ``The navy poses a threat in
the first place to ourselves.''
   Kolton recounted several accidents or near accidents he said he
had survived aboard Soviet nuclear subs, including one aboard the
country's first nuclear-powered submarine, the Leninsky Komsomol, in
1962.
   Poorly constructed valves designed to shut off the flow of steam
from generators in the eactor system malfunctioned, allowing steam
to flow into the crew's living quarters. Kolton says a disaster was
averted, but doesn't say how.
   Western reference books say the ship suffered a reactor meltdown
in the 1960s, but it was unclear whether this was the same accident
Kolton described.
   Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev later gave Kolton and the rest of
the crew a top award. ``This was the pay for serious construction
deficiencies, threatening the ship and crew,'' wrote Kolton.
   Criticism of the ship has also come from U.S. experts. The late
chief of the U.S. Navy's nuclear program, Adm. Hyman Rickover, said
after touring the Leninsky Komsomol in 1959 that its construction
was a ``sloppy job.''
   One Western reference book, ``Modern Soviet Weapons,'' says
Soviet naval ships suffer frequent breakdowns and that sailors are
poorly trained.
   In another incident _ for which Kolton did not give a date _ four
Soviet sailors died in a poorly designed test of a submarine rescue
chamber.
   He said naval problems are frequently covered up.
   ``Experience shows that when a disaster occurs in the fleet,
commissions protecting the high leadership hide the main guilty
people, and with them also the basic reasons for the disasters,''
Kolton said.

<TEXT>
   Indians and descendants of settlers of the
Northern Plains are joining together for a four-day prairie
extravaganza celebrating North Dakota's 100th birthday.
   An encampment demonstrating the Indian way of life 100 years ago
is sharing space with an estimated 3,000 cowboys in a 300-unit wagon
train at the festivities that officially begin Saturday. Indian
dancers will be on the same program with those depicting Lt. Col.
George Armstrong Custer's 7th Cavalry.
   The exhibits are aimed at showing the good things about each
culture without dredging up the battles of the past, organizers say.
   Jill Nodland, assistant director of the state Indian Affairs
Commission, said the 22,000 Indians in the state have mixed feelings
about participating in the centennial party.
   Some feel ``we are all in this together and we have to learn to
live together,'' while others believe the Indian reservations are
not part of the state, she said.
   ``God, I hope not,'' Terry Bernhardt, the coordinator of the
Indian and wagon-train encampment, said when asked whether human
rights' issues associated with the settlement of the Plains will be
explored during the gathering.
   ``I guess we want to accent the positive. It is a positive
celebration and we want to keep it with the positive stuff,'' he
said. ``It is more like when the white settlers first got here, the
Indians got along well. That is what we are recreating now.''
   Up to 300 Indians, fur-trappers and buckskinners from four states
have demonstrations and exhibits planned during the centennial
celebration, which has been dubbed the ``party of the century'' by
the state Centennial Commission.
   Bernhardt calls the encampment a once-in-a-lifetime chance to see
what life was like for the pioneers.
   ``The Indians are coming from all over the U.S. We have every
tribe that I can think of represented,'' he said.
   Standing Rock Sioux Tribal President Charles Murphy said some
Indians on his reservation are ``all charged up'' about the
centennial bash while others are heading to other cities during the
long Fourth of July weekend.
   Patrick Brown, a spokesman for the state Centennial Commission,
said planners visited North Dakota's four reservations two years ago
to ask the tribes how best to involve them in the centennial.
   As a result of those meetings, an Indian centennial logo was
created, a Native American Day was celebrated in April and a
curriculum on Indians was written for schools, Brown said.
   ``You can't really have a festival celebrating the people who
live on the prairie without involving Native Americans,'' he said.
   Minor friction existed between settlers and Indians in 1889 when
North Dakota became a state but there was no open conflict, said Jim
Davis, a historian for the state Historical Society.
   The reservations, established in 1867, were well entrenched by
statehood, he said.
   ``Hostilities in North Dakota were pretty much over right after
the Custer massacre. There were few incidents after 1876,'' Davis
said. ``There were still some hard feelings and stuff like that. The
military presence was still on some of the reservations.'' Custer
and more than 200 of his men were killed in battle at Little Big
Horn in 1876.
   For the centennial party, both cultures will demonstrate how they
sold and traded goods decades ago, how they made their clothes and
household goods and some of the ceremonial dances.
   Organizers of the event, four years in the planning, expect that
the population of Bismarck and neighboring Mandan _ together about
65,000 people _ could swell by 100,000 over the four days.

   With a light wind at their backs and sunny skies
above, four French students embarked Friday on an unusual class
project _ a windsurfing voyage across the Atlantic.
   The students plan to surf in four-hour shifts during the
month-long trip, a catamaran sailing alongside with a support crew
of five classmates.
   ``We've been dreaming of leaving New York City from the bay,''
said Arnaud Crussol, 21, before departing from South Street Seaport.
``It's a sunny day, there's a wind, a good direction wind. So
everything is OK.''
   Minutes later he was standing up on the board, working the
orange-and-blue sail to catch a fresh breeze that sent him skimming
down the East River toward the harbor.
   Crussol dropped the sail as a tugboat and barge steamed past,
briefly rocking the board and catamaran. Then it was on toward the
Statue of Liberty, the Narrows and the open seas of the North
Atlantic.
   Destination: La Rochelle, France.
   ``We are not very well-known windsurfers but we are good
windsurfers,'' said Amaury de la Bouillerie, at 19 the youngest of
the group from the Institut Superieur du Commerce in Paris.
   ``We are very excited _ we have been preparing for a year,'' said
Beatrice Comby, 22, the lone female windsurfer.
   Their school encourages students to take a year to work on a
project unrelated to their studies. The business students spent the
time lining up sponsors, training and learning the ropes on the
40-foot fiberglass catamaran, equipped with sophisticated radio
equipment and a fax machine for weather reports.
   ``It's just for fun that we do this,'' de la Bouillerie said.
``We were friends and we love windsurfing. And we wanted to do
something very special and so, thanks to our school, we could work
for one year doing that, looking for sponsors.''
   The Atlantic has been crossed by windsurfers twice before, the
first time in 1982 by Stephan Peyron of France in a large, boat-like
vessel.
   The students will be using a conventional board: ``It's a normal
windsurf, it's a beach toy, in fact,'' Crussol said.
   One difficulty: the windsurfer will usually travel faster than
the catamaran, ``so the windsurf will have to slow down,'' Crussol
said.
   ``The biggest problem? Having no winds,'' de la Bouillerie said.
``It's the one thing we are worried about.'' That and storms, which
become more likely as the summer weeks go by.
   On the distant shore wait their countrymen and worried parents.
   ``They are a little bit afraid but they know we are prepared,''
Miss Comby said, ``so there is no big problem.''

   Climber the Cat is gone but not
forgotten after spending 17 days perched in a white pine before
escaping the grasp of a would-be rescuer, tumbling about 65 feet to
the ground and running away.
   ``Eric said, `Mommy, you promised we could keep the kitty,'''
said Mindy Kates, the homeowner who played reluctant hostess to
Climber since she has never been crazy about cats.
   Her children, Eric, 6, and Alycia, 3, felt differently about the
tabby, and hoped to adopt him.
   ``By the end of the summer, I'm sure they are going to have one.
I just have to psyche myself up about cats.''
   Climber's sit-in drew the attention of a Lowell cable television
station. But when the crew hoisted a bucket truck to Climber's
perch, about 25 feet off the ground, he climbed higher.
   A tree service raised another bucket on Thursday to the cat's new
location, about 65 feet up. Climber dug his claws into the tree when
a worker made a grab, then plummeted, his fall broken by branches
and the truck.
   Although the identity of the cat's real owner remained a mystery,
Kates said she was visited by a neighbor who said his cat had been
missing for nearly three weeks.
   ``He said it wasn't friendly and it would never be good with
kids,'' said Kates. ``The man said, by the way his name is Duffy. I
said, `Well to my kids, he'll always be Climber.'''

<HEAD>IRS Proposes Changes, Asks Public Comment</HEAD>

   The Internal Revenue Service proposed on Friday
several changes designed to improve 1989 individual income tax forms
and announced new forms for reporting children's investment income
and additional capital gains.
   It is the third year the IRS has released the new forms and asked
the public to comment and offer suggestions.
   One new form, numbered 8814, would allow parents to report on
their own tax return the investment income of dependent children
under 14. Last year, such children with investment income over
$1,000 were required to file their own returns and were taxed at
their parents' rate.
   The IRS also plans a new Schedule D-1, a continuation sheet for
Schedule D that can be used to list additional capital gains and
losses.
   The proposed changes in existing forms include:
   _The name and address area on Forms 1040 and 1040A was redesigned
so a husband and wife filing a joint return can enter their names on
separate lines. The IRS said this would help keep each person's name
and Social Security number from being mismatched, especially when
they use different last names.
   _A line was added to Forms 1040 and 1040A for taxpayers to enter
the new supplemental Medicare premium if they are liable for it.
   _A line was added to Schedule 1 of Form 1040A and to Form 2441
for taxpayers to enter the names and Social Security numbers of
their children and dependent care providers as required by law.
   _The line for reimbursed employee business expenses was removed.
Revisions also were made to Form 2106 to reflect changes in the law
covering the reporting of reimbursements and other expense allowance
arrangements.

   Once again, Sadek Mahdi has lost power as
the democratically designated prime minister of Sudan, one of
Africa's poorest nations.
   The first time, more than two decades ago, Mahdi was victim to
the parliamentary system. On Friday, it was the military who brought
him down, in an apparently bloodless coup by officers who said his
dilly-dallying has ruined the country.
   Oxford-educated Mahdi, 53, encouraged a free press and lively
parliamentary debates during his three years in power. But his
aloof, reticent style of governing could not come to grips with
civil war, flood devastation, a battered economy and rampant
starvation.
   His first experience with the premiership was brief. Mahdi gained
power as prime minister in July 1966 at age 30, becoming Sudan's
youngest leader. Interparty squabbles brought down his coalition
less than 10 months later.
   General governing chaos continued, giving Gen. Gaafar Nimeiri the
opportunity to stage a coup on May 25, 1969, and end the experiment
in democracy.
   When the army overthrew Nimeiri 16 years later, few believed
promises that control would be surrendered to civilians in a year.
   But, true to their word, the generals oversaw fair elections in
April 1986. Mahdi won and he got his second chance.
   His election followed a family pattern of Sudanese leadership
begun by his great-grandfather, Mohamed Ahmed Abdullah, Sudan's
national hero who organized an uprising that in 1885 overthrew
British rule. That self-rule ended with a British takeover 12 years
later.
   In 1881, Abdullah declared himself the Mahdi, a messianic figure
that some Moslems believe God will send as successor to the prophet
Mohammed.
   Sadek Mahdi's grandfather, Abdel-Rahman Mahdi, in 1945 founded
the Umma Party, establishing a power base of the 3 million to 5
million Sudanese who believe Abdullah was the Mahdi.
   Sadek Mahdi succeeded his father, Siddiq, as Umma chief in 1961,
five years after independence. His aspirations to lead the Mahdists'
Ansar sect led to a split in 1971, and the ousted ruler and an uncle
remain at odds.
   Contending with his Islamic heritage are Mahdi's years at Oxford,
where in 1957 he took a degree in philosophy and political science.
He became as fluent in English as in his native Arabic, and also an
adept tennis player.
   Yet Mahdi has two wives, approved in Islam, and always appears in
public in Sudan's traditional flowing white robes and turban.
   In the months before the coup, Mahdi had to compromise his
religious background by suspending Islamic laws introduced by
Nimeiri _ a condition for opening talks with the rebel Sudan
People's Liberation Army.
   Mahdi finally gave in early this year when the army and
professional and trade unions handed him an ultimatum.
   Afterward, he formed a new broad-based Cabinet, abrogated a
defense pact with Egypt, sent officials to talk to the rebels in
neighboring Ethiopia and decided to hold a constitutional conference
in September to settle the civil war.
   His steps seem to have come too slowly. Many Western and Sudanese
experts feel that in trying to please all parties and remain in
power, Mahdi lost his footing and fell.

<HEAD>AT&amp;T Gets Go-Ahead for Customized Long-Distance</HEAD>

   The Federal Communications Commission gave
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. the go-ahead Friday to offer
customized long-distance service to large corporate and government
customers.
   The commission, denying challenges by MCI Communications Corp.,
US Sprint and others, said AT&amp;T's so-called Tariff 12 had not been
shown to be illegal or discriminatory.
   The decision was seen as a major victory for AT&amp;T, battling to
retain a share of the important market for custom-designed networks
that large companies use for internal communications.
   The FCC orginally declared the plan illegal in an April 18 ruling
because it was not equally available to all customers with similar
needs. But the commission suspended a two-year investigation and
allowed AT&amp;T to continue offering the plan while giving the company
30 days to revise it.
   AT&amp;T filed a revision in May in the midst of a slew of challenges
by competitors who said the tariff was a disguise for predatory
pricing. AT&amp;T said in its revised offering that it wouldn't penalize
companies that dropped the plan, also adding some services and
changing some rates.
   Gerald Brock, FCC common carrier bureau chief, said Friday that
``no compelling argument has been presented that the proposed tariff
is so patently unlawful as to warrant rejection.''
   He also said there was no evidence that further investigation was
warranted.
   ``The controversy stems solely from competitors attempting to
roll regulatory logs at AT&amp;T each time it wins what they have lost
in fair, open competition,'' said AT&amp;T spokesman Herb Linnen.
   US Sprint spokeswoman Janis Langley said the FCC action was
further evidence ``of the illegality and unlawfulness of the FCC
order suspending the (Tariff 12) investigation and it's also
evidence of the FCC's intention to rubber stamp all of the Tariff 12
filings.''
   Kathleen Keegan of MCI said her company was disappointed ``with
the FCC's failure to recognize Tariff 12 is a customer-specific
vehicle for offering discriminatory rates on services that are
generally available.''
   ``We believe that the court appeal will affirm our view,'' she
said.
   FCC, MCI, Sprint and the Independent Data Communications
Manufacturers Association filed suit against the April ruling in the
U.S. Court of Appeals. That action is pending.
   Tariff 12 first was used in 1985 to provide a service to the
Defense Department and its 12 users, include General Electric, Ford
Motor Co. and E.I. DuPont de Nemours. Opponents said it was designed
to disguise rate discounts, and that AT&amp;T was illegally selling the
service below cost.

<HEAD>Art Institute School Develops New Rules for Controversial Displays</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Bush, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Critics say strict new guidelines could stifle
creativity at an art school where exhibits including the flag on the
floor and the late mayor in women's clothes touched off protests.
   But a state lawmaker who was arrested for picking up the
exhibited flag praised the guidelines released Thursday by the
School of the Art Institute of Chicago.
   The school now can ``relocate or remove'' any exhibit that ``may
be disruptive to the educational process'' or ``hazardous to the
health and or safety of viewers or participants.''
   Harvey Grossman, legal director of the American Civil Liberties
Union in Illinois, said that is ``particularly vague and could
result in chilling and inhibiting student creativity and
expression.''
   Grossman said school officials should ``explain to students just
what that standard means. ... I'm sure they intend to do that.''
   The guidelines, formulated by a committee of students, teachers
and administrators, also give the school the authority to determine
``when, if, how long and where'' students' art will be shown.
   The Art Institute has been the site of protests within the past
two years over two student exhibits. One included an American flag
placed on the floor where it could be walked on and the other a
painting of former Mayor Harold Washington in women's undergarments.
   State Sen. Walter W. Dudycz, a Republican who led protests
against the flag exhibit, praised the guidelines as an attempt to
treat controversial student exhibits equally.
   ``They had no policy whatsoever,'' said Dudycz. ``The Harold
Washington painting was forcibly removed in 24 hours and the school
issued a public apology. When I picked up the flag and folded it, I
was promptly arrested, there was no apology and the exhibit
continued.''
   Marshall Field V, president of the board of trustees, spelled out
the new policy in a letter to board members.
   A long debate in arriving at the guidelines shows ``the extreme
difficulty of balancing personal freedom of expression in an
educational environment with responsibilities to ... community
concerns and public sensitivities,'' Field wrote.
   A spokeswoman for the school, Christine O'Neill, said much
attention was focused on the school because of the flag exhibit and
the new policy guidelines are ``in response to great public
concern.''
   Meanwhile in Springfield, lawmakers cut the school's request for
state funds from $130,000 for next year to $1 in retaliation for the
flag exhibit. But David Fields, spokesman for Gov. James R.
Thompson, suggested Thursday that Thompson might use his amendatory
veto to eliminate the $1-a-year restriction.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist Party leaders Friday
rejected an appeal to free all political prisoners, meet with human
rights activists and reassess the 1968 Soviet-led invasion that
crushed political reform.
   In Washington on Friday, a U.S. official said the chief political
officer at the U.S. Embassy in Prague was ordered to leave the
country for what Communist authorities called excessive involvement
with dissidents.
   The U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
diplomat Robert Norman had been due to leave Prague in about a month
for transfer to another assignment. The official said everything
Norman did was ``compatible with his duties there.''
   Czechoslovak rights activists on Thursday called on the Prague
leadership to allow peaceful demonstrations, free all political
prisoners and reassess the 1968 invasion.
   The document was titled ``A Few Words,'' an allusion to the
``2,000 Words'' manifesto of 1968 that is considered one reason the
Warsaw Pact invaded.
   A source in Vienna said 1,800 intellectuals, actors, artists and
blue-collar workers had signed it.
   The ruling party Politburo lashed out at ``the attempt at a new
provocative signature campaign of some illegal groups aimed at
confrontation with the socialist state, the socialist political
system.''
   The Politburo, as reported by the state news agency CTK, also
charged ``illegal groups, with the help of certain political circles
in the West, try to create tension in society with the aim to
destabilize conditions in our country.
   ``These are dangerous efforts, which must be opposed with utmost
resolution,'' the statement added.
   The Communist Party daily Rude Pravo denounced what it said was
``an appeal for confrontation with the socialist state ...
containing demands for the recognition of Charter 77 ...(and) its
free destructive activity ... and for a return to unlimited private
enterprise.''
   ``It is an appeal to sell-out socialism ... they want to
overthrow our social system,'' Rude Pravo said.
   The appeal was issued in the name of four rights campaigners,
including playwright Vaclav Havel, according to the London-based
Palach Press newsletter and other sources.
   It called for ``a free discussion ... to review not only the
(Stalinist) 1950s but also the Prague Spring, the invasion of
Czechoslovakia by the five armies of the Warsaw Pact, and the
process of `normalization' that followed.''
   The Czechoslovak leadership, still suspicious of Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms, has so far refused to re-examine the
1968 reforms. The invasion that crushed them is officially still
described as a necessary action to defend socialism.
   The appeal called for religious freedom and an end to political
manipulation and censorship.
   Rude Pravo indicated the signatories of the appeal might be
disciplined for their initiative, but it did not elaborate.
   ``Patience has its limits. There is a very instructive saying:
`those who sow wind will reap storm.' It is time for everyone who
wants to play with the fire to realize this,'' the newspaper said.
   Rude Pravo also quoted Politburo member Miroslav Stepan as
telling a meeting Thursday that the authors of the appeal ``do not
hide their ... counterrevolutionary intentions.''

<HEAD>Reports Say Party Elders Urge Uno to Resign</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Japan-Socialist, Bjt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   News reports Friday said party elders want Prime
Minister Sousuke Uno to resign after less than a month in office
because a sex scandal has tarnished the clean image for which he was
chosen.
   Uno, the foreign minister, was selected largely because he had
not been touched by the Recruit influence-buying scandal that drove
Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita from office June 2.
   The Recruit affair reached the top echelons of business, the
bureaucracy and the Liberal Democratic Party, which has governed
Japan since 1955. Uno promised political reforms, but has been
unable to carry them out because of allegations that he kept paid
mistresses.
   He has spent much of the week denying reports of his impending
resignation. The latest version, on Friday, was that he would step
down after elections in three weeks for half the seats in
Parliament's upper house.
   ``No one has said anything like that,'' the newspaper Asahi
quoted Uno as saying Friday.
   A dispatch by the Kyodo news service said, however, that three
party elders agreed at a meeting Friday that he should resign ``for
the benefit of the party'' and suggested Finance Minister Tatsuo
Murayama as a temporary replacement.
   It said the agreement was reached by former Prime Minister Takeo
Fukuda, a representative of former Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki and
Susumu Nikaido, another senior party member.
   Fukuda and Suzuki had opposed the choice of Uno because of his
close ties to Yasuhiro Nakasone, Takeshita's predecessor. Nakasone
is linked to the scandal in which the Recruit Co. conglomerate is
accused of trying to buy influence with political donations and
cut-price stock shares.
   Other reports quoted the chief Cabinet secretary, Masajuro
Shiokawa, as saying Uno's resignation and general elections ``might
come before long.''
   Shiokawa believes Uno's resignation could solve many of the
government's problems, but that timing was important, major
newspapers reported.
   Reports that Uno kept several paid mistresses have dashed hopes
that he could repair the damage done to his party by the Recruit
affair.
   The sex scandal also has become an international embarrassment
for Japan, with the approach of an economic summit scheduled for
July 14 in Paris, and has affected the stock and currency markets.
   Elections for the Tokyo Municipal Assembly, to be held Sunday,
will be watched as a harbinger of the upper house contests July 23.
   A poll published by the national daily Mainichi indicated the
Liberal Democrats would lose the Tokyo election decisively.
   It said the number of women saying they would leave the governing
party to support the Socialists had risen from 8 percent to 18
percent, and the number who would support the Liberal Democrats had
declined from 33 to 18 percent.
   Kyodo said a women's organization in Miyazaki, western Japan,
gathered more than 1,000 signatures on a petition to Uno saying:
``It is an embarrassment for Japan to be represented at the summit
by a person who tramples over women.''

<HEAD>Mobutu Says Angola Doesn't Need Arms, U.S. May Mediate in Mozambique</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Zaire's President Mobutu Sese Seko said Friday
there was no need for the United States and Soviet Union to continue
arming rebels and the government in Angola now that the warring
sides have agreed to cease fire.
   Mobutu, credited with successfully mediating between the two
sides in Angola, also said Mozambique's President Joaquim Chissano
had asked him to convey a message to President Bush, presumably
dealing with possible U.S. mediation efforts between the government
and rebels in that country.
   Mobutu said he had accepted a request by Chissano last week that
he mediate in Mozambique the way he had in Angola.
   He declined to say what was in the message he delivered to Bush
Thursday at the White House.
   A senior American diplomat, Assistant Secretary of State Herman
Cohen, will travel to Mozambique in mid-July to discuss recent
contacts between the left-leaning government and the South
African-backed RENAMO rebels. Cohen is also visiting South Africa,
Angola and Zambia.
   Mobutu, meeting with reporters at Blair House across from the
White House, said Cohen would discuss with Angolan authorities the
subject of establishing diplomatic ties with the United States, but
he refused to go into details.
   ``Things are moving along quite favorably,'' he said, adding that
the question of U.S.-Angolan ties had come up at the two-hour
meeting with Bush.
   Conservative groups have opposed U.S. diplomatic ties with
Angola, including the creation of a small American office set up to
monitor the pullout of Cuban troops from Angola under a
U.S.-sponsored agreement signed last December.
   Mobutu, who helped funnel U.S. arms to the Angolan rebels _ the
Union for the Total Independence of Angola, or UNITA _ said the
government and rebels should now concentrate on economic
rehabilitation of their country.
   ``Do UNITA and Angola still need weapons?'' he asked. ``The sons
and daughters of Angola must now dedicate themselves'' to
rehabilitation. ``Why must we have continues arms?''
   Pressed on whether Washington should cease arming UNITA, Mobutu
said the United States ``is a sovereign government. It's up to them
to decide.''
   The Soviet Union will probably decide to stop arming the Angolan
government in view of the cease-fire agreement ``in order not to
uselessly poison the situation,'' he said.
   Mobutu also said he had threatened to cut off ties with South
Africa if the government carried out the death sentences against 14
blacks involved in the death of a policeman. The executions have
been stayed pending efforts by the 14 to appeal.
   A senior administration official said this week that the United
States would prefer that Mobutu concentrate his mediation efforts in
Angola rather than in Mozambique.
   Mobutu hosted a summit of African leaders at his palace in
Gbadolite last week at which Angolan President Jose dos Santos and
Jonas Savimbi, leader of the UNITA rebels, agreed to end their
14-year war and seek talks on power-sharing.
   Mobutu's diplomacy in arranging the peace meeting paved the way
for a successful visit to Washington in spite of allegations from
members of Congress and advocacy groups of human rights violations
and corruption in his government.

   A fire touched off by a series of explosions sent
choking smoke through a midrise office building today, killing four
people and injuring dozens of others. Terrified occupants waited at
windows for rescue and at least one jumped, authorities said.
   An unidentified woman was listed in critical condition after
leaping from a sixth-story window, and more than 20 other people
were taken to hospitals after the fire broke out at midmorning.
   Sandra Walker, a spokeswoman for the mayor's office, said the
fire began on the sixth floor and eventually affected the fourth,
fifth and seventh floor as well. The building, located just north of
downtown on Peachtree Street, the city's main thoroughfare, has
about 10 stories.
   Tom Perrin, acting fire chief, said by midafternoon that
firefighters who conducted a floor-by-floor search were reasonably
certain that there were just four people killed. But he would not
completely rule out the possibility finding other victims.
   In addition to the woman who jumped, a man was talked out of it
by passers-by on the street, Perrin said. That man was eventually
rescued, he said.
   ``When you have people jumping out of windows, you've got a panic
situation,'' he said.
   At least 38 people were injured, said Keith Williams, a police
spokesman. Twenty-four were taken to hospitals, he said.
   Mike Blackman, a worker in one of the sixth-floor offices, was
rescued by a fire department ladder ruck from a window broken out
with a chair. After breaking out the window, Blackman said, ``we
were all just hanging out trying to breathe. We thought we were
gone.''
   Witnesses others reported hearing several explosions as the fire
broke out, and said there had been an electrical problem in the
building a short time before.
   Dot Bissell, general manager of Southeastern Travelers Exhibitors
Inc. in Suite 600, said she heard at least four explosions,
describing them as ``tremendous in strength'' and ``illuminated with
an orange light.''
   The lights had gone out a half-hour earlier and an electrician
had been working in an electrical room next to her office when the
explosions occurred, she said. Like Blackman, she was rescued
through a broken window.
   As firefighters battled the blaze, traffic was halted on at least
four main roads in the busy area north of downtown.
   The names of the dead and injured were not immediately released.
   The woman who jumped from a sixth-story window was listed in
critical condition at Piedmont Hospital, where at least 11 people
were taken.
   The building, at 1718 Peachtree St., houses offices, a restaurant
and a few shops. Among the building's tenants are the local offices
of the National Transportation Safety Board.
   The building was built in 1962 and had no sprinkler system,
authorities said. They were not required in buildings constructed
before 1965.
   Tom Steele, who worked in an eighth-floor office on the opposite
side of the building from the fire, said the office has fire drills
every year.
   ``We made a practiced evacuation; everyone was calm,'' he said.

<HEAD>USDA Opens Up New Lands for Haying and Grazing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   An additional move to open up emergency haying
and grazing on conservation land was announced Friday by the
Agriculture Department.
   Keith Bjerke, administrator of the department's Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service, said haying and grazing in
designated counties had been approved on Conservation Reserve
Program land planted before July 1, 1987.
   Under the new action, eligible producers will be able to cut hay
and graze livestock on CRP land that was planted or replanted
between July 1 and Dec. 1, 1987, Bjerke said.
   However, the land must be inspected by USDA Soil Conservation
Service personnel ``to ensure that there is an adequate stand of
vegetation established'' befor haying and grazing will be approved,
he said.
   ``This extension of the cutoff date will open a significant
number of additional CRP acres to help relieve the drought
emergency,'' Bjerke said. ``In addition, every county ASCS office
will begin keeping a list for county producers of eligible land that
is available for haying or grazing.''
   Under the CRP, farmers contract the the government to take highly
erodible land from production for 10 years, on condition they plant
the land in protective cover crops such as grass and trees.

<DATELINE>SEABROOK, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A vice president at the Seabrook nuclear
plant was fired after the facility was shut down following problems
in the control room during a low-power test.
   George Thomas, a vice president in charge of nuclear production
at the $6 billion reactor, was fired Thursday because of
``inappropriate management actions'' after the June 22 shutdown,
plant spokesman Ron Sher said Friday.
   ``It is premature to discuss just why he has been relieved,''
Sher said.
   But Sher said Thomas was in the control room as an observer at
the time of the shutdown, and that the problem with Thomas came
after the shutdown, not before.
   Sher said it was too early to speculate whether they would fire
other employees.
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the state attorney general and
the plant are investigating how control room personnel reacted when
they learned of a valve malfunction that forced the shutdown after
nine days of testing.
   Edward Brown, president of New Hampshire Yankee, which operates
the plant, has acknowledged that control room operators did not
follow proper procedures when the valve malfunctioned in the
non-nuclear side of the plant.
   NRC officials have said it took inspectors five minutes and
discussions with at least three people to convince them to shut down
the reactor.
   Seabrook officials since have said the low-power tests
successfully proved the design and operation of the plant, and the
tests will not be resumed even after the various reviews. They hope
for a commercial operating license later this year.
   Brown personally relieved Thomas, who then resigned from his
position as a vice president with Public Service Company of New
Hampshire, the chief owner of the plant, Sher said.
   Thomas declined to comment on the firing or resignation.
   Thomas was the fourth-highest paid executive at Public Service as
of Dec. 31, 1988, with a salary of $127,403. He reported to Brown
and was responsible for all phases of plant operation and support
services, Sher said.
   Thomas, who lives near the Seabrook plant, joined the Yankee
Atomic Electric Co., which supervised Seabrook construction, in
1977. Two years later, he joined Public Service as nuclear
production superintendent. He was made a vice president in 1982.

   A needle exchange program aimed at
preventing the spread of AIDS among intravenous drug abusers is
about ready to begin after a year of bureaucratic and funding
problems.
   The Multnomah County Board of Commissioners on Thursday approved
a $35,000 grant to insure the program's sponsor, the private,
non-profit Outside-In clinic and social service agency. In addition,
the commission allocated $15,000 to study the program's
effectiveness.
   The program, announced in June 1988, was to have been the first
in the country. But Outside-In encountered a series of problems,
notably the inability to get and pay for insurance.
   In the meantime, needle exchange programs have begun in several
cities, including Tacoma, Wash., Boulder, Colo., and New York, as
well as in seven European countries, Oliver said.
   The American Foundation for AIDS Research is also giving the
program $67,000, Oliver said. That will pay for medical malpractice
and liability insurance and needles designed to break after a single
use, as required by the insurance company.
   ``We see this as a comprehensive AIDS education program,'' said
Oliver. ``The needles are just a part. We'll use that as a hook to
try to get them into counseling, because the ultimate aim is to get
them to stop using drugs.''
   Oliver said Outside-In now is faced with finding money to
continue the program beyond the one-year pilot period.
   Oliver expects several hundred drug users to take advantage of
the exchange program, which is expected to begin in early August.
   There are 7,000 to 10,000 intravenous drug abusers in Multnomah
County, the state Health Division says.
   Statistics show the deadly acquired immune deficiency syndrome is
spreading more rapidly among needle-sharing drug abusers than any
other segment of the population.
   Nationally, about 20 percent of the 82,764 AIDS cases reported
between June 1981 and the end of 1988 have occurred among
intravenous drug users. In Oregon, intravenous drug abuse accounts
for about 4 percent of the AIDS cases.

<TEXT>
   American pianist Van Cliburn, who catapulted to
fame when he captured the Tchaikovsky Competition 31 years ago,
returned Friday to Moscow at the invitation of Raisa Gorbachev to
perform two concerts.
   The Fort Worth, Texas, resident, accompanied by his 92-year-old
mother, arrived in Moscow aboard a private jet and was greeted at
his hotel by eight elderly fans who presented him with bouquets of
flowers.
   ``We would have waited all night,'' said Irina Barmash, who
displayed photographs taken during Cliburn's most recent visit to
the Soviet Union in 1972.
   The wife of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev invited Cliburn to the
Soviet Union after he performed for them during Gorbachev's summit
meeting with then-President Ronald Reagan in December 1987.
   Cliburn's White House performance of the Soviet composition
``Moscow Nights'' moved the Gorbachevs to song. The 54-year-old
pianist had ended an 11-year hiatus from public concerts for the
performance.
   The pianist has been one of the world's most acclaimed musicians
since his triumph at the 1958 Tchaikovsky Competition at the age of
23. After winning the international tournament for young pianists,
Russian-born composer Peter Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1
became his signature music.
   Cliburn remained a darling of Soviet music-lovers despite the ups

   A jury ruled today against a high-roller who
claimed an Atlantic City casino plied him with alcohol and
painkillers, forcing him to gamble until he lost $165,000.
   A federal jury deliberated for about three hours Thursday and
today before finding that Shmuel Aboud, 44, of New York City must
pay a $28,000 gambling debt he amassed in 1985 at the Golden Nugget
Casino-Hotel.
   Aboud had contended he suffered from narcotic and alcohol
intoxication and the casino took advantage of his condition.
   The jury ruled that the Golden Nugget acted negligently, but that
the casino's action did not cause Aboud's gambling losses.
   ``This tells the patron that they can't get drunk and blame
someone else,'' Golden Nugget attorney Steven Horn said after the
verdict. ``We think that this claim was totally frivolous _ a lie _
and the jury believed it.''
   Aboud's attorney, Steven Goldman, asked the judge to poll the
jury. He said he is considering filing an appeal.
   ``He was sleeping at the table,'' Goldman said during closing
arguments Thursday in the lawsuit filed by Aboud. ``His head was
rocking back and forth from nodding.''
   The civil case was being closely watched by the state's casino
industry and attorneys involved in the case say the outcome could be
precedent-setting.
   Last week, U.S. District Court Judge Mitchell H. Cohen ruled that
casinos can be held liable for money lost by drunken gamblers. Today
verdict meant that the jurors believed however that in Aboud's
specific case the liability didn't exist.
   The judge had ruled that casinos, like tavern owners, have a
responsiblity to their customers, prompting speculation that the
decision could mean that casinos will stop serving free drinks.
   ``It will affect the casino industry _ not greatly,'' Horn said.
``This ruling by the judge could be overturned or define more
clearly in a way that will make it difficult for the patron to
prevail.''
   Aboud, an Israeli citizen, contends he lost $165,000 during a
gambling spree at the Golden Nugget in February and March 1985 after
casino officials coaxed him to drink alcohol and take narcotic
painkillers for his aching back.
   ``This man lived a horror story for two weeks _ the big Golden
Nugget and little Sammy Aboud,'' Goldman told the jury. ``The guy
was like a zombie.''
   The Golden Nugget filed a lawsuit in 1985 against Aboud seeking
payment of gambling debts totaling $28,000 that Aboud amassed at the
casino.
   The casino has since been sold. It became Bally's Grand in 1987.
   ``Nobody put a gun to Mr. Aboud's head,'' said Stephen N. Dratch,
an attorney for the casino. ``He is looking for someone to blme for
his own foolishness.''
   Aboud filed a counterclaim against the casino, claiming he was
``deprived of his reason and understanding'' after casino officials
offered him drinks while he gambled.
   He had sought unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. But
Cohen refused to allow the jury to consider the punitive claims,
ruling that Goldman failed to present evidence of the casino's
wealth.

<HEAD>Tropical Storm Still Soaking Texas, Louisiana</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Remnants of Tropical Storm Allison dumped more water Friday on
parts of Texas and flood-weary Louisiana, where Gov. Buddy Roemer
declared a state of emergency in six parishes.
   Four days of relentless rain pushed swollen Louisiana rivers,
streams and bayous above flood stage and in some spots the waters
weren't expected to crest for two days, meaning still more floods
for the long Independence Day weekend.
   Some parts of the state have received more than 20 inches of rain
since Allison came ashore in Texas on Monday afternoon, tossing
thunderstorms and tornadoes across eastern Texas and all but the
southeastern tip of Louisiana.
   Originally expected to move north and dissipate, the low-pressure
system that once was Allison moved back into Texas and was centered
near Houston raining on areas that were already soaked.
   Flood watches remained in effect Friday in southeast and east
Texas and the National Weather Service extended a flash flood watch
to include parts of northeast Texas, extending from the upper Gulf
Coast to as far north as Paris, Tyler and Nacogdoches.
   At Winnfield, the north-central Louisiana city that received
almost two feet of rain in two days, the rain stopped Friday morning
and water began receding. But 40 families remained in an evacuation
center, waiting for water to leave their homes.
   And Mayor Max Kelley worried that an earthen levee at a lake
might give way.
   ``If that happens we're talking about another surge of water,''
said Kelley. ``I don't know how high it would get.''
   The National Weather Service kept revising flood warnings,
pushing up expected river crests.
   In southwest Louisiana, forecasters said the Calcasieu River was
eight to 14 feet above flood stage in some areas and still rising.
Low-lying roads and bridges were threatened and 60 houses at the
town of Oakdale were likely to flood this weekend, the weather
service said.
   At the town of Kinder, the Calcasieu was 14 feet above flood
stage Friday morning and was expected to hit the 30-foot mark _ 18
feet over flood stage _ by Sunday.
   ``The U.S. Highway 190 bridge and the railroad bridge may become
inundated above 29 feet,'' the weather service warned residents of
Kinder. ``Numerous homes may need to be evacuated.''
   The western and central parts of Louisiana took the worst of the
storm Thursday and Friday, but flood waters that plagued Baton Rouge
earlier in the week didn't recede in some subdivisions where more
rain was forecast.
   ``It's gone down overnight about an inch, an inch and a half,''
said Barbara Hatfield, as she surveyed the scene in the Highland
Creek subdivision.
   ``It's still too high to get the cars out,'' she said.
   Roemer on Thursday declared a state of emergency in six parishes
and dispatched National Guard troops and equipment to help victims.
   All but Pointe Coupee Parish were among the 36 Louisiana parishes
which qualified for state and federal assistance just three weeks
ago when tornadoes hit the state.
   Several hundred homes have flooded since Tuesday. Few damage
estimates were available, but in Iberville Parish, near Baton Rouge,
officials estimated damages at more than $1 million.
   In Port Arthur, Texas, the weather service measured 3 inches of
rain from midnight to midday Friday, boosting the city's June total
to 17.5 inches, breaking the record of 15.04 inches set in June 1942.
   Street flooding was reported in Port Arthur and nearby Beaumont,
where more than five inches of rain fell Friday, and residents were
advised not to travel unless absolutely necessary. Minor street
flooding also was reported in Houston.

<HEAD>Newspaper: Iceland's Prime Minister Wants U.S. Military to Leave</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DARMSTADT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Steingrimur
Hermannsson of Iceland wants U.S. troops based on his island nation
to go home, a U.S. military newspaper said Friday.
   ``I am looking forward to the time when the Americans can return
to the states,'' Stars and Stripes quoted Hermannsson as saying. ``I
certainly hope it can happen in the foreseeable future.''
   The Darmstadt-based newspaper, which calls itself the
``authorized unofficial'' publication for the U.S. armed forces,
said there are 3,200 U.S. military personnel based in Iceland.
   Stars and Stripes did not say where or when the interview with
Hermannsson took place.
   The newspaper said the military base at Keflavik, about 30 miles
west of Reykjavik, has been the center of controversy for the past
month.
   Iceland officially protested a May 16 farewell speech by the
outgoing commander of the U.S. Defense Forces Iceland, Rear Adm.
Eric McVadon, who called on Icelanders who support the U.S. presence
to speak out, the newspaper said.
   ``McVadon also implied that Icelandic authorities were ungrateful
to the U.S. troops,'' it said.
   Iceland is the only NATO member without its own military, and it
relies on American forces for protection.
   Hermannsson said his country is a staunch supporter of the
alliance and not anti-American, but he was critical of a weeklong
U.S. military exercise in Iceland that ended Wednesday, Stars and
Stripes reported.
   It said he had U.S. officers reduce the number of soldiers
participating from 1,300 to 950.
   Stars and Stripes said controversy over the exercise began when
the Icelandic national radio wrongly reported the military exercise
was to begin on June 17, the 45th anniversary of Iceland's
independence from Denmark. The report sparked an 11-hour debate in
Iceland's parliament.
   ``Many feel that it was a mistake. Although we were fully aware
of the fact that such an exercise would be undertaken, it seemed to
have escaped everybody that they would be so extensive,'' the
newspaper quoted Hermannsson as saying.
   When asked if he could see an end to the U.S. presence in
Iceland, the newspaper quoted him as saying: ``I am certainly hoping
that this will be so.''
   ``There are a number of people in Iceland who would like to see
the base disappear,'' Hermannsson said.
   However, Stars and Stripes, quoting an unidentifed Foreign
Ministry spokesman, said independent surveys the past 10 years
indicate most Icelanders support the Keflavik base and NATO alliance.

   A tired Minnesota letter carrier rode up to
Postal Service headquarters Friday, ending a 1,700 mile bicycle trip
he made to encourage the federal government to spend more money for
research into children's cancer.
   Gary Fitch, of St. Paul, Minn., was greeted by Postmaster General
Anthony M. Frank and other top postal officials as he arrived at the
end of a trip he began June 3.
   ``I'm pretty tired, but it was worth it,'' said Fitch as he
delivered a box of 2,500 letters from St. Paul grade school
children, appealing to the federal government to spend more for
research into children's cancer.
   Fitch said his effort was aimed at increasing the federal budget
for children's cancer research, and he also hoped to raise $1
million for a cancer research center at the University of Minnesota.
   In the current fiscal year, the National Cancer Institute's
budget is $1.59 billion, including $50 million for research into
childhood cancer, said NCI spokeswoman Kara Smigel. In the fiscal
year beginning Oct. 1, the proposed NCI budget is $2.1 billion,
including $52.5 million for childhood cancer.
   Fitch's trip began at the state capitol in St. Paul. The
37-year-old rider covered a total of 1,756 miles on his 18-speed
bicycle and was accompanied by a friend who drove alongside in a car.
   Fitch said he made the trip using his vacation time and paid for
it out of his own pocket. The total cost was about $2,500, he said.

<HEAD>Bank of Canada Replaces Dollar Bill With `Loonie' Coin</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bank of Canada stopped issuing dollar bills
Friday in the latest step of a program to phase in the 11-sided,
gold-colored ``loonie'' coin.
   The Royal Canadian Mint has 240 million of the new $1 coins
already in circulation and believes that any reluctance among
Canadians to use them is fading, spokesman Michael Francis said.
   Dollar bills remain legal currency indefinitely, but their life
expectancy under normal use is from nine to 12 months. The $2 bill
is now the smallest issued by the Bank of Canada.
   Francis, in an interview from Ottawa, said banks and retailers
might tire of handling both $1 coins and bills. He predicted that
the coin might become standard by the fall.
   ``Demand for the dollar coin has gone up steadily since
January,'' Francis said.
   He said the mint was distributing 1 million of the ``loonies''
weekly in January and the number rose gradually to 5 million weekly
by May. The mint distributed 9.8 million of the new coins one week
in June, he said.
   It is nicknamed for its design of a loon, the bird that makes its
distinctive call in many northern Canadian lakes.
   The mint learned some lessons from the quick fade of a U.S. $1
coin before launching the coin. The Canadians found the U.S. Susan
B. Anthony coin was too close in size to the quarter, confusing
consumers, and the public relations campaign wasn't extensive enough
before the coin's launching in 1979.
   The decision was made to have a special color and size for the
loonie, which was introduced in July 1987 after being considered for
nine years.
   The mint says the dollar coin was introduced to meet the needs of
transit companies, vending machine operators and retailers for a
coin bigger than 25 cents. The mint estimates it will save about
$147 million in two decades.
   That's because dollar bills last only one year, while a coin can
stay in circulation for 20 years.
   But Canadians have complained that not enough vending machines
have been converted to the loonie. Some men complain the coin wears
out trouser pockets. Edward Banning, coin columnist for the Globe
and Mail newspaper, wrote last weekend that the coins ``are
beginning to circulate a little more freely, although many Canadians
still seem reluctant to use them and even some government agencies
seem ill-prepared to keep the loonies off the endangered species
list.''

   President Bush, expressing a strong belief that
``apartheid is wrong and that it must end,'' said Friday that the
United States should provide funds for education, housing and
community programs for South Africa's blacks in ``a determined
effort'' to end it.
   After meeting with anti-apartheid activist Albertina Sisulu, Bush
issued a statement praising her, saying she ``personifies the
struggle for human rights and human dignity and her presence here is
an inspiration to us all.''
   ``We believe strongly that apartheid is wrong and that it must
end,'' Bush said. He said the administration would work with
Congress to obtain funding for education, housing and community
programs for South Africa's blacks.
   ``Such programs should not be misunderstood as our acquiescing in
apartheid, but rather viewed as a determined effort to bring it to
an end,'' Bush's statement said.
   The president's statement did not refer to Mrs. Sisulu's call for
the United States to impose comprehensive economic sanctions against
South Africa.
   Mrs. Sisulu, whose family has come to symbolize the struggle
against South Africa's racial segregation policies, said Bush told
her he was outraged by the apartheid system practiced by 5 million
whites who rule 23 million blacks.
   ``He hopes the (U.S.) administration will be a catalyst for
bringing about change'' in South Africa, she told reporters after
the 20-minute White House meeting.
   Bush, at whose invitation Mrs. Sisulu came to the United States,
met with her shortly before attending a ceremony to commemorate the
25th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
   Mrs. Sisulu, the first South African actvist invited by a U.S.
president to Washington, said she had asked Bush to impose
``comprehensive, mandatory sanctions'' to force the government to
negotiate with the black majority.
   ``He said he had difficulty, but he will see what to do with''
the question of tougher sanctions than those already imposed by the
United States in 1986, she said. Asked whether Bush had ruled out
additional U.S. measures, she said ``No, he didn't.''
   Former President Reagan was forced to impose limited economic
sanctions against South Africa after the Democratic-controlled
Congress overrode his veto.
   Liberal Democrats have been pushing this year for tougher
sanctions after failing to gain passage of such a measure last year.
   The White House has said it opposes any congressional
restrictions against South Africa which would limit the
administration's hands in dealing with the government there.
   But Bush has been more active than his predecessor in broadening
contacts with both sides in order to advance negotiations between
blacks and whites.
   In addition to Mrs. Sisulu, he has met with other leading
anti-apartheid activists. F.W. de Klerk, who is expected to become
South Africa's president later this year, has been invited to visit
and will become the first South African leader to have official
talks in Washington in 30 years.
   Assistant Secretary of State Herman Cohen will be in South Africa
next week.
   Mrs. Sisulu's husband, Walter Sisulu, has been serving a life
term since 1964, when he was arrested along with Nelson Mandela and
other founders of the guerrilla arm of the outlawed African National
Congress.
   Two of her five children have fled South Africa and she has been
under house arrest and other restrictions for some 18 years.

   A week after security forces discovered
two tunnels dug by a group of leftist prisoners, inmates say they
still are determined to escape from the high security prison.
   ``We want freedom,'' a group of prisoners shouted in unison from
behind iron bars during a brief meeting with reporters Thursday.
   ``There is no justice in this country. So we will dig a new
tunnel, we will do whatever possible to win our freedom,'' said Ali
Kemal Bilginer, a member of the leftist Dev-Yol organization.
   Some leftists have been jailed for nine years and are waiting for
their trials to end.
   Justice Ministry authorities took a group of journalists to the
central Anatolian city, Eskisehir, for a brief tour of the prison
where 326 leftist inmates are jailed. The officials did not allow
journalists to see all parts of the prison or talk freely with
inmates.
   Security forces in the prison uncovered two underground tunnels
40 yards and 45 yards long on May 22.
   Ugur Ibrahimhakkioglu, Eskisehir's chief prosecutor, said the
prisoners melted the soil with urine and dug with handmade tools.
Bilginer said they had dug for two months.
   The prisoners painted masks and left them on their pillows at
night, fooling guards that they were sleeping while they dug.
   Ten leftist inmates, from Dev-Yol and another leftist
organization called Kurtulus, said they dug the tunnels.
   ``We were arrested nine years ago, and tried at military courts
in a most despotic way. We were not allowed to defend ourselves and
some of our friends are still waiting for their trials to end,''
said Naim Koc of Kurtulus.
   Trials of 173 inmates still are continuing in upper courts.
   A wave of terrorism that pitted leftists against rightists
claimed 5,000 lives in Turkey prior to a military takeover in 1980.
   About 30,000 extreme leftist and rightist terrorist suspects were
jailed following a martial law crackdown.
   Since then, thousands have been released and dozens of trials
have been concluded. But some of the largest mass trials continue.
   According to statistics compiled by Turkey's independent Human
Rights Association, 1,542 terrorist suspects are in prison and still
on trial and 1,357 were convicted and are serving sentences.
   Since the tunnels were discovered, prison authorities have
emptied the first floor and moved inmates to the second floor.
   Inmates complained security forces raided the wards and took away
their typewriters, record players and radios in the past week.
   Koc said 45 prisoners started a hunger strike Thursday to protest
the restrictions and would continue their protest until their
belongings are returned.
   Mehmet Kok, a spokesman for Dev-Yol, said 40 other inmates will
join the hunger strikers Monday.
   Justice Minister Oltan Sungurlu said the typewriters were taken
away because they could be used for digging and the radios could be
used to communicate with the outside.

   Universities can allow blacks
and whites to live in the same dormitories but they still must seek
official permission, the government said Friday.
   Chris Heunis, minister of constitutional development, said the
government will grant exemptions under the law that requires blacks
and whites to live separately. It was one of his final acts before
retiring next week.
   South Africa's universities are designated for certain races,
although most have a few students of all races. Blacks attending
white universities have had to find their own housing if separate
dormitories are not provided.
   A white student leader at one of the country's most prestigious
universities recently was expelled, and later readmitted, for her
role in a protest of segregated dormitories.
   Leslie Durr, 21, was expelled on June 2 from the University of
Stellenbosch in Cape province, the most liberal of South Africa's
five Afrikaans-language universities.
   As president of the school's branch of the anti-apartheid
National Union of South African Students, Ms. Durr helped organize a
demonstration in May by about 100 students and teachers opposed to
the university segregated dorms.
   Stellenbosch has about 13,300 white students and about 500 who
are black, Asian or mixed-race.
   The university reinstated Ms. Durr after it received protests
about her expulsion.

Ottoman Turks.
   The defeat was the start of a five-century struggle to keep

   Facts and figures on Sudan:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE LAND _ With an area of nearly 1 million square miles, Sudan
is Africa's largest country, as vast as the United States east of
the Mississippi. It is bordered by eight countries: Egypt, Ethiopia,
Kenya, Uganda, Zaire, Central African Republic, Chad and Libya.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PEOPLE _ About 16 million of Sudan's nearly 22 million people
live in the mainly Moslem north. There were about 6 million
southerners, largely animist and Christian, when an anti-government
rebellion began in the south in 1983 over economic and
administrative grievances. Since then, hundreds of thousands of
southerners have died from fighting or hunger and an estimated 2
million have fled the region.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE ECONOMY _ Sudan's mainly agricultural economy depends on the
waters of the Nile River. The chief crops include cotton, sorghum,
sesame, peanuts, rice, sugar. Sudan also has small textile and
food-processing industries. Oil was found in the south a few years
ago, but its exploitation has been stymied by the civil war. Its
foreign debt stands at $13 billion, and the civil war has been
costing the Khartoum government about $1 million daily.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ Sudan has had close ties with Egypt for thousands of
years and was ruled by an Anglo-Egyptian grouping at the end of the
19th century. From 1924, when Egyptian forces withdrew, until 1955,
Britain was the dominant power. Sudan declared its independence on
Jan. 1, 1956, becoming a republic with a presidential form of
government.
   Gen. Gaafar Nimeiri seized power in a coup May 25, 1969. He
abolished the multiparty system and established his Sudanese
Socialist Union as the sole legal party. He decreed Islamic law in
September 1983, triggering strong resentment in the
animist-Christian south and fueling the rebellion there.
   The military overthrew Nimeiri in April 1985 and ruled for a
year, then it surrendered power to a civilian government led by
Prime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi after his Umma Party won a
parliamentary majority in general elections. Under pressure from the
army, el-Mahdi opened preliminary peace talks with the southern
rebels in May.

   Terrorists linked to a bombing that killed a
U.S. Marine got part of a $600 million loan made to East Germany
with the help of an American bank, according to former National
Security Council staff member.
   Norman A. Bailey, senior director of national security planning
from 1981-83, said the money from the 1985 loan was dispersed to
front companies and tax havens around the world.
   ``It was then concentrated again in Libya and was sent from Libya
to various accounts, which were controlled by terrorist
organizations, and was then used by those terrorist organizations in
their activities,'' Bailey said.
   Bailey made his allegations during the taping of ``Follow the
Money,'' a Public Broadcasting System program.
   The official Libyan news agency, JANA, denied the story.
   ``Such claims are the latest inventions of the machine of
misinformation and lies,'' JANA said.
   The loan, Bailey said, was traced through the National Security
Agency, a super-secret group at Fort Meade, Md., that listens in on
international communications.
   Lt. Gen. William Odom, who directed that agency from 1985-88,
said on the PBS program that he couldn't comment directly.
   ``I will say that such flows would not be abnormal for the East
bloc's way of supporting Third World activities,'' Odom said.
   White House spokesman Roman Papadiuk said he had no information
to substantiate Bailey's statement.
   Tom Lindeman, a spokesman for the First National Bank of Chicago,
said a $600 million loan to East Germany was organized in 1985 with
the International Bank of Japan.
   About 50 banks from different countries were involved, he said.
   Alan Delp, the Chicago bank's senior vice president in charge of
international banking, said he would be very surprised if the money
went to Libya.
   ``It would be very foolish on the part of the East Germans,'' he
said.
   Helmut Krausser, a representative of the bank that received the
money, East Germany's Aussenhandelsbank (Foreign Trade Bank), said
on the PBS program that he didn't think Libya had received that kind
of support.
   Bailey said there was no question the loan could be traced.
   ``We can identify a money trail ... which eventually ended up in
the death of American Marines in a discotheque in Berlin and the
death of Libyans through American bombing of Libya,'' he said.
   On April 5, 1986, a bomb in a West Berlin discotheque killed a
U.S. sergeant and a Turkish woman, and wounded 204 other people.
Nine days later, U.S. planes bombed Libya.
   West German economist Peter Pietsch said it was not very probable
that West German banks were involved.
   ``It is certainly possible that East Germany was engaged in this
kind of activity,'' he said. ``But that ... is extremely hard to
prove.''
   Bailey, who heads his own consulting firm, said in an interview
that he still has top secret clearance that allows him to see highly
confidential papers.
   White House spoksman Bill Harlow said it was not unusual for
officials to keep their security clearance if they are consultants
or contractors who need access to secret material after they left
the government.

   A federal judge today denied a motion by Oliver
North to throw out his Iran-Contra convictions because of alleged
misconduct by a juror.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell said the defense failed to
prove that a juror who gave inaccurate answers on an initial
questionnaire, Tara Leigh King, was biased against North.
   The ruling cleared the way for North's sentencing next Wednesday
for his May 4 conviction on three criminal charges in the
Iran-Contra scandal. He could be fined up to $750,000 and sentenced
to 10 years in prison.
   The juror had answered ``no'' when asked whether she or any
relatives had been involved in court proceedings or in an
investigation. A brother spent 14 months in prison for armed robbery.
   At a hearing on Wednesday, she said she had forgotten the episode.
   While ``the Court cannot credit King's testimony,'' Gesell said
in a nine-page ruling, ``no proof was presented indicating that King
was unfair or that she failed in any way to serve conscientiously.
She voted to acquit North of many felony counts.''
   ``King was not biased for or against either side,'' the judge
concluded.
   North was convicted of aiding the obstruction of Congress,
mutilation of official documents and acceptance of an illegal
gratuity.

   The European Community and four cities where
modern printing was born announced Friday a new media prize for
European newspapers and television: the Stendhal Award for
journalism and communications.
   The prize, named for the French novelist who spent much of his
time in Italy, will honor the best front page, best business
section, best European coverage and best TV news show of the
continent.
   Stendhal, whose real name was Marie Henri Beyle, wrote his famous
novel ``The Charterhouse of Parma'' while living in Parma.
   The city also has Europe's oldest daily newspaper, ``La Gazzetta
di Parma,'' where Gianbattista Bodoni created his distinctive
lettering style two centuries ago. The newspaper was founded in 1735.
   Parma was joined by three other cities in the sponsorship: Mainz,
West Germany, the birthplace of Johann Gutenberg; Antwerp, Belgium,
the home of Christophe Plantin, a 16th century Belgian typographer;
and Lyon, France, the site of the first experiment in printing on
metal and wood.
   The prize was created by the European Community and private
sponsors and will be administered by a foundation. The first awards
will be made in September 1990 on the basis of entries submitted in
1989.

   A high-roller bears responsibility for his
losses at an Atlantic City casino and was not forced to gamble under
the influence of narcotics and alcohol, a jury ruled Friday.
   The federal jury deliberated three hours over two days before
finding Shmuel Aboud, 44, of the New York City borough of Queens,
must pay a $28,000 gambling debt he ran up in 1985 at the Golden
Nugget Casino@Hotel.
   The jury ruled that the Golden Nugget acted negligently, but that
the casino's action did not cause Aboud's gambling losses.
   ``I think justice was done,'' Golden Nugget attorney Stephen
Dratch said. ``It was his own actions that caused any alleged
losses.''
   Aboud had said the casino took advantage of his narcotic and
alcohol intoxication.
   ``This tells the patron that they can't get drunk and blame
someone else,'' said Steven M. Horn, another casino attorney.
   Aboud's attorney, Steven Goldman, hailed the jury's finding that
the casino acted negligently. He had urged the jury to speak out
against what he characterized as deceitful tactics by the casino
industry. ``I think it's a moral victory,'' Goldman said.
   Goldman said he is considering an appeal.
   Aboud said he was disappointed.
   ``I feel as it's some big lie _ from the beginning to the end,''
he said.
   The civil case, which lasted about two weeks, was closely watched
by the state's casino industry. Casino officials said the outcome
should lessen the impact of a potentially precedent-setting decision
that said casinos can be held liable for money lost by drunk
gamblers.
   Casinos, like tavern owners, have a responsiblity to their
customers, U.S. District Judge Mitchell H. Cohen ruled, prompting
speculation that the decision could mean casinos will stop serving
free drinks.
   ``These cases are going to be extremely hard to prove _ both from
a liability point of view and a damage point of view,'' Dratch said.
``The odds are always in favor of the casino.''
   Aboud, an Israeli citizen, contends he lost $165,000 during a
gambling spree at the Golden Nugget in February and March 1985 after
casino officials coaxed him to drink alcohol and take painkillers
for his aching back.
   In 1985, the Golden Nugget sued Aboud, seeking payment of
gambling debts.
   The casino has since been sold, becoming Bally's Grand in 1987.
   Aboud filed a counterclaim saying he was ``deprived of his reason
and understanding'' after casino officials offered him drinks while
he gambled. He also filed negligence claims against two physicians,
called by the casino, who prescribed the painkillers.
   The jury ruled that the physicians acted properly in prescribing
the medication.
   Goldman charged on one occasion, Aboud gambled at a blackjack
table with a bottle of Percodan, prescribed by the physicians,
sitting next to him.
   Casino employees, laughing at Aboud, awakened him and said he had
to gamble or he would have to go home, Goldman charged.
   Aboud's gambling losses came during a 14-day stay in a
$1,000-a-day complimentary hotel room, Goldman said. His client had
recently won a $395,000 insurance settlement in an car accident, he
said.
   Dratch said Aboud's total losses during the spree were only about
$2,000 and that he took advantange of complimentary services
totaling $16,329 during his stay.

<DATELINE>BATTIR, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 2,000 Israelis guarded by
soldiers hiked and drove through the West Bank and Gaza Strip on
Friday in a symbolic exercise of Jewish rights in the occupied lands.
   They participatd in 40 demonstrations organized by the settler
movement Gush Emunim, or Bloc of the Faithful. The army ordered that
the hikers avoid isolated Palestinian villages and be guarded by
military patrols.
   Military spokesmen said there were no serious problems.
Palestinian witnesses reported minor incidents of West Bank
residents throwing stones at Jewish settlers in Hebron and near
Bethlehem.
   About 20 soldiers of the elite Golani Brigade landed by
helicopter to stop a like number of men and boys from making an
unescorted hike into Battir, a village near Bethlehem.
   ``This is a minority creating trouble,'' said Maj. Gen. Amram
Mitzna, head of the army's central command. He spoke to reporters
after alighting from the helicopter about a mile from the village.
   ``If we have to arrest them, we'll arrest them,'' he said. ``We
won't let them go anywhere.''
   The hikers, members of American-born Rabbi Meir Kahane's militant
Kach Party, carried automatic rifles, knives, clubs and party flags
with a fist set in the Star of David. They did not resist and headed
back to Jerusalem.
   In other developments:
   _ General strikes were held in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank
towns of Ramallah and El-Bireh to protest Israel's deportation
Thursday of eight Palestinians accused of helping lead the
Palestinian rebellion. At least 538 Palestinians and 23 Israelis
have been killed since the uprising, known by the Arabic word
``intefadeh,'' began Dec. 8, 1987.
   _ Israeli soldiers wounded 11 Palestinians in the daily street
battles that have become a staple of the uprising. West Bank
hospital officials said a 14-year-old girl suffered a serious
gunshot wound in the head.
   _ Guards fired tear gas to stop riots in Meggido Prison in
northern Israel, where about 2,000 Palestinians are held for
security offenses. An army spokesman said several soldiers and eight
inmates suffered tear gas inhalation.
   Friday's demonstrations were advertised as hikes, but some were
entirely motorized. They were organized after repeated complaints by
settlers that the army was not doing enough to protect them.
   Armed attacks by Jewish settlers on Palestinians have increased
recently and two Palestinians have been killed.
   About 70,000 Jews live in enclaves among the 1.7 million
Palestinian residents of the West Bank and Gaza, which Israel
captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Leftist politicians called Friday's demonstrations a provocation
to Palestinians and a burden on the army.
   Brig. Gen. Ephraim Sneh, a former military governor of the West
Bank who is a legislator from the center-left Labor Party, said the
hikes would increase tension.
   ``In the context of the intefadeh, these are not hikes; these are
political protests,'' he said on Israel radio. ``When they increase
friction with the Arabs instead of reducing it, they have the most
negative value.''
   Officials of Gush Emunim said the purpose was to assert Jewish
rights to go anywhere in the occupied lands, which the settlers
claim as part of biblical Israel.
   ``The Bible grew up in this land,'' said Yehuda Hazani, a Gush
Emunim organizer. ``All these places are linked to the Bible, but we
chose the places according to the landscape and nature.''
   In the battle of symbols that is part of the uprising, settlers
waved Israeli flags as they drove to an ancient synagogue near
Hebron, past Palestinian flags hanging from utility wires. Israel
has declared the Palestinian flag illegal.
   Three helicopters circled overhead. Soldiers patrolled Samua, the
village where the second century synagogue is located.
   Noam Arnon, spokesman for Gush Emunim, pointed out damage to the
synagogue and said: ``There is terrorism both against people and
against archeological sites.''
   A Palestinian teacher, who identified himself only as Mohammed,
said residents resented the Jewish intrusion on the Moslem sabbath
because, ``Today is our day for praying.''

   A cannon that shoots a very expensive jet of water
over the Chicago River was turned on Friday to become part of a $3.5
million monument to the city's improved water quality.
   Water commissioners held a ceremony Friday to turn the spigot on
for the Chicago River Water Arc, a jet that courses up 80 feet from
the river's north bank, arching over the water to fall near the
opposite bank 210 feet away.
   The arc is part of the Centennial Fountain, a granite,
semicircular, step-style structure dedicated Friday to mark 100
years of water-quality improvements for Chicago _ an Indian term
meaning smelly swamp.
   Dedication of the fountain, located near downtown's Magnificent
Mile, drew several hundred spectators, who basked under bright sun
and a dazzling blue sky to the strains of a 10-piece orchestra.
   ``The Chicago River is no longer an open sore, but is now a
valuable resource,'' said U.S. Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill. ``Even
if you just arrived in Chicago, you can see what I mean.''
   ``The buildings put up just years ago were made to face away from
the riverbanks. Take a look at what's going on now. Everyone wants
to take advantage of the view and the promenades and the escalating
property values.''
   Visitors also heard a poem written for the ceremony by Pulitzer
Prize-winner Gwendolyn Brooks, as well as speeches by government
leaders from Mayor Richard M. Daley to U.S. Veterans Affairs
Secretary Edward Derwinski, a Chicago native.
   Not everyone was thrilled.
   ``They're squandering money,'' said Paul Sadler, 65, who bicycled
up shortly after the arc was turned on. He said he believes priority
should be given to improving housing and employment and drawing more
industry to the area.
   ``I'm sure there are a lot of people who feel the same way, but
they don't speak out. They swallow it,'' he said.
   But Frank Sullivan, spokesman for the Metropolitan Water
Reclamation District, said, ``If you accept that reasoning, then
there should be no public sponsored memorials or public works of art
in the United States.
   ``Over the years, the fountain and the arc will attract many
times their cost in tourist business and add to the enjoyment of
beauty by Chicago residents, just as the Buckingham Fountain has
since the 1920s.''
   The water district lists among its achievements the digging of
the 26-mile long Sanitary &amp; Ship Canal, the largest engineering
project of its kind before construction of the Panama Canal, and the
consequent reversal of the flow of the Chicago River, turning it
away from Lake Michigan.
   The canal helped pull the city out of a plague of epidemics of
typhoid and cholera caused by water-borne diseases during the latter
part of the 19th century.
   Since then, the district has built locks, sewage-treatment
plants, canals to handle water discharged from the plants, the
area's Deep Tunnel system to drain off excessive storm water from
the city and from older suburbs, and reservoirs to hold storm water
from newer suburbs.

   The Navy's oldest civilian engineer retired
Friday, after a career that spanned two world wars and included a
stint helping Charles Lindbergh design the pontooned planes he flew
to China.
   Rudy Ries, 89, was honored during ceremonies at the Naval
Training Systems Center for his achievement of being the oldest
full-time civilian employee in the Navy.
   ``You've been an inspiration to us all,'' said Capt. C.D. Rowley,
commanding officer of the Naval Training Systems Center, as he
presented Ries with a number of certificates, letters of
commendation and a plaque. ``We are all proud you were one of us.''
   In a letter read to Ries, Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett III
thanked him for his 26 years of dedicated service.
   When the German-born Ries joined the German Air Force in 1916,
World War I had ended before he could become a fighter pilot. In
1928, he saw the onset of Naziism in his country and came to America
as a mechanical engineer.
   Ries began his latest career in 1963 and might have continued in
his job, he said in an interview, if his wife, Julia, hadn't died
last year and if the nature of his engineering work hadn't changed.
   He's a hands-on engineer and much of today's engineering is just
paperwork, Ries said. In effect, he said, they've taken away his
drafting board.
   ``I enjoy engineering. I think engineering is designing things,
creating things,'' he said. ``But one thing we've turned to now is
just writing specifications ... for somebody else to build
something. I don't like this.''
   He described the reams of specifications turned out by today's
engineers as ``letters to Santa Claus.''
   In earlier years, Ries worked with Lindbergh and Adm. Richard
Byrd in designing pontoons for the planes they flew to China and the
South Pole.
   He worked first for Fairchild Aviation and then Merganthaler
Linotype Co. before joining EDO Aircraft on Long Island in 1930. He
became an American citizen in that year.
   It was at EDO that he worked with Lindbergh and Byrd.
   ``Lindbergh and his wife were flying to China and he wanted
special floats outfitted to the bottom of the plane, with a motor in
between, in case he landed in the water,'' Ries said.
   The Lindbergh's returned to EDO aircraft after their flight to
China and had lunch with Ries and other company officials. ``I
loaned him my pocketknife to cut his onions with, and I've still got
that knife,'' Ries said.
   He helped design one of the world's first high-altitude metal
planes, was a consultant in the Ukraine to Soviet builders of the
American-designed PBY flying boat and worked for the Fokker Aircraft
Co. in the Netherlands before the Germans invaded Poland,
precipitating World War II.
   In recent years, he has designed training simulators to explode
Tomahwak and Harm missiles when they fail to detonate in combat and
maneuvers. He is also responsible for the design of a training aid
for the military's newest torpedo, the Mark 50.
   He said he intends to keep active when he returns to his native
Germany to live with his son and family in Bonn. His son, Eric Ries,
is a civil engineer with the State Department there.

<HEAD>USDA Report Indicates Hog Farmers Holding Back on Expansion Plans</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Hog farmers continue to hold back on expansion
plans, apparently waiting to see how markets develop and 1989 grain
crops shape up, a report by the Agriculture Department indicated
Friday.
   As of June 1, the U.S. inventory of hogs and pigs totaled an
estimated 55.5 million head, 1 percent below a year ago but 6
percent more than two years ago, the report said.
   The breeding inventory was put at 7.33 million head, down 3
percent from a year earlier but 4 percent more than two years ago.
Market hogs, at 48.2 million head, were down 1 percent from a year
ago but were up 7 percent from two years ago.
   Officials said the pig crop during the first half of the current
hog marketing year that began Dec. 1 was 46.5 million head, down 1
percent from the same period of 1987-88 but 7 percent more than two
years ago.
   In the 10 largest states, which account for 79 percent of the
U.S. inventory, farrowing intentions for June through November total
4.66 million, a 1 percent increase from a year ago and 2 percent
more than two years ago.
   According to the department's Economic Research Service, breeding
and farrowing plans ``will closely reflect prospects for this year's
corn and soybean crops.'' The outlook for those will take shape in
August, when USDA provides comprehensive production estimates.
   ``Many (hog) producers have endured losses since last fall so
their plans will be especially sensitive to feed costs,'' the agency
says in a new outlook report. ``An unexpected below-average harvest
this year likely would prompt large-scale liquidation and sharp
production cutbacks in 1990.''
   The following list shows the June 1 inventory in the 10 major
states. The first number, in thousands, is the total number of hogs
in the state, the second is the June 1 figure's percentage of a year
earlier.

   China's senior leader Deng Xiaoping on Friday
completed the purge of his one-time protege, Zhao Ziyang, who was
disgraced after expressing sympathy for the student-led movement for
democratic reforms.
   Zhao, ousted as Communist Party chief last weekend, was fired
Friday from his last government post, vice chairman of the Central
Military Commission.
   He was effectively stripped of power more than a month ago, after
he paid a tearful visit on May 19 to students on a hunger strike in
Tiananmen Square. He has not been seen in public since.
   Hundreds of thousands of students and their supporters flocked to
the square, the symbolic center of China, until the military crushed
the seven-week pro-democracy movement by firing on unarmed civilians
to drive protesters from the plaza on June 3-4.
   Tiananmen has been closed since, but authorities planned to
reopen it to tourists Saturday to mark the 68th anniversary of the
founding of the party, according to the official newspaper, the
People's Daily.
   ``Since comrade Zhao Ziyang has committed serious mistakes, I
proposed his dismissal from the vice-chairmanship of the Central
Military Commission,'' Deng said in a letter to the National
People's Congress.
   The state-run Xinhua News Agency said the legislature's Standing
Committee carried out Deng's wishes. The congress has little power
and mainly serves as a forum to publicize party policy.
   President Yang Shangkun, who spent his career in the military,
reportedly was seeking to replace Zhao on the commission. The
commission's senior vice chairman is second only to Deng in the
military hierarchy.
   Yang has extensive contacts in the military, and he was a strong
supporter of the martial law Premier Li Peng imposed on Beijing on
May 20.
   Zhao reportedly opposed the decree and the use of troops to quell
the pro-democracy movement.
   The Communist Party last weekend appointed Jiang Zemin, a former
Shanghai mayor and party boss of China's largest city, to replace
Zhao as general secretary.
   The party's Central Committee accused Zhao of splitting the party
and supporting ``counterrevolutionary turmoil.''
   Deng has continued to call Zhao ``comrade,'' however, indicating
that Zhao has been allowed to remain a party member.
   The congress' Standing Committee opened its session Thursday by
endorsing the government's crackdown as ``legal, correct and
necessary.''
   Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong told the committee on Friday that more
than 200 civilians, including 36 college students, were killed when
thousands of soldiers backed by tanks made their way to Tiananmen
Square.
   ``Dozens'' of soldiers also died in the violence, Xinhua quoted
Chen as saying.
   The government previously has said that 200 to 300 people died,
half of them soldiers.
   Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence reports say that up to
3,000 people, most civilians, were killed. Western diplomatic
sources in Beijing said this week that the death toll was ``in the
thousands.''
   Chen said 3,000 civilians and 6,000 soldiers and police were
injured, and more than 1,000 army trucks, 60 armored cars and 120
buses were damaged or burned. He put damages at $350 million, Xinhua
said.
   The government has arrested more than 1,800 people as part of its
crackdown and has announced 27 executions.
   Many speakers during the legislative session attacked Hu Jiwei, a
member of the Standing Committee and president of the Chinese
Confederation of Societies of Journalism, for leading a signature
campaign against martial law, Radio Beijing said.
   The petition drive sought an extraordinary session of the
Standing Committee to overturn martial law in what speakers called a
``serious political incident,'' the radio said.
   A widely publicized editorial that appeared Friday in a party
journal on theory joined the official media in defending the
crackdown.
   ``The recent event was by no means a patriotic movement to
promote socialist democracy and freedom and to demand for punishment
of official profiteering and elimination of corruption,'' the
journal Seeking Truth said.
   ``It was a planned, organized and premeditated political turmoil
plotted by an extremely small number of people who made use of such
slogans to agitate the students and people unaware of the truth,''
said the editorial, carried by Xinhua.

<HEAD>Investigation Into Attack Of Black By White Youths To Close</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OXFORD, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal officials have dropped their
investigation into a black teen-ager's claims that he was attacked
by a gang of white youths who scratched K's into his back.
   Tracy Eichelberger, 17, accused federal investigators of bungling
the case after officials announced Thursday that it was being closed
for lack of evidence.
   ``The whole time the FBI has been trying to make me out to be the
person who did something wrong,'' he said. ``It looks like they
spent more time investigating the people I was associating with than
the people who supposedly committed the crime.''
   Eichelberger, who graduates from Louisville High School this
summer, claimed he was attacked Oct. 3, 1987, at an abandoned car
wash by several white youths who warned him not to socialize with
white girls.
   Eichelberger, who did not report the incident until 20 days after
he said it occurred, did not claim to have been beaten and
apparently did not seek medical treatment.
   During the 20-month investigation, FBI agents conducted more than
70 interviews and a grand jury held three sessions, said U.S.
Attorney Robert Whitwell and James P. Turner, acting assistant
attorney general of the Civil Rights Division of the Justice
Department.
   ``The comprehensive investigation revealed insufficient evidence
of a violation of federal law and the FBI and grand jury cases are
therefore being closed,'' the statement said.
   The teen-ager testified before the grand jury Thursday. He
earlier met with the grand jury April 12 and said he gave the names
of the attackers.
   The case, and another incident in which a Louisville man
threatened to castrate a black college student, prompted a series of
protest marches and a boycott of white-owned businesses in March
1988.
   The castration threat resulted in a two-year suspended prison
term and three years' federal probation last year for Charles Melton
Wells, who pleaded guilty to sending threatening letters through the
mail.
   Blacks have since continued to march every other Saturday,
protest organizers said.

   An FBI agent who investigated the D.B. Cooper
skyjacking said Friday there are a number of similarities between
Cooper and a man recently arrested in an 18-year-old New Jersey
multiple murder case.
   Ralph Himmelsbach, who retired in 1980, said Friday that he
believes ``Cooper'' died when he parachuted from a Boeing 727 over
southwest Washington in 1971 with $200,000 in ransom. But
Himmelsbach, who led the Cooper investigation, still believes John
E. List should be investigated.
   ``I would say he's a major suspect or, at least, I would consider
him a major suspect,'' Himmelsbach said in a telephone interview.
   As a fugitive after the killings of five members of his family,
List was considered a suspect in the skyjacking from the beginning,
Himmelsbach said.
   Descriptions of List and Cooper are similar. Both are accused of
bizarre crimes, and a fugitive from a mass murder has nothing to
lose, Himmelsbach said.
   A man police say is List was arrested June 1 in Richmond, Va.,
after the television show ``America's Most Wanted'' ran a program on
the ``ballroom murders'' in November 1971. List's wife, his
87-year-old mother and his three children were shot to death in
their Westfield, N.J., mansion.
   The man, who goes by the name Robert P. Clark and was described
by friends as a quiet, church-going accountant, was extradited to
New Jersey on Thursday and is in jail awaiting a court appearance.
   Although the man known as Clark denies he is List, authorities
say fingerprints and a scar prove Clark and List are the same man.
Authorities say List fled to Colorado and then Virginia and had
built a new life without changing his appearance or profession.
   FBI spokesman John Eyer in Seattle said Thursday that List was
being investigated in the skyjacking, but said it was routine.
   David Baugh, List's lawyer in Richmond before he was returned to
New Jersey, compared the alleged connection to reported sightings of
Elvis Presley.
   On Thanksgiving eve 18 years ago, 15 days after the killings, a
passenger named ``Dan Cooper'' on a Northwest Airlines flight from
Portland gave a stewardess a note saying he had a bomb. On the
ground in Seattle, he released the passengers and most of the crew
in return for $200,000 and four parachutes. When the plane headed
for Mexico, the hijacker took the money and bailed out somewhere
over southwest Washington.
   ``I would say first of all he (List) does fit the general
description,'' Himmelsbach said. ``The photograph of him
contemporaneous with the hijacking resembles the artist's conception
of what he (Cooper) looked like.
   ``I understand that List received an inheritance _ and spent it _
of $200,000 shortly before (the killings). The hijacker demanded
$200,000. It might be a coincidence, but it might also be a link.''
   List also ``had absolutely nothing to lose as a fugitive from
justice with the heaviest penalty possible hanging over his head. He
had nothing whatever to lose by committing a daring and dangerous
crime.''
   Part of the ransom money, $5,800 in $20 bills, was found on a
Columbia River sandbar in February 1980. Himmelsbach thinks it
washed down from an unknown site where Cooper died.
   But the case is the nation's only unsolved skyjacking.
   The former agent, 63, is a private investigator at Butte Falls,
Ore., near Medford.

<HEAD>Judge Denies Motion for North Mistrial</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal judge in Oliver North's Iran-Contra
case denied a motion for a mistrial Friday, saying a juror probably
lied to the court but ``had no desire to help or to hurt North.''
   The ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Gerhard Gesell clears the
way for North to be sentenced Wednesday.
   The former White House aide was convicted of aiding and abetting
an obstruction of Congress, altering and destroying documents and
illegally accepting a gratuity.
   His lawyers sought a mistrial, disclosing after the May 4 verdict
that juror Tara Leigh King had given incorrect information about her
background. King answered ``no'' when asked whether she or any
relatives had been involved in court proceedings or an investigation.
   King failed to disclose that her brother, Sam King, had served
time in prison for armed robbery and that she had been questioned,
subpoenaed and testified before a grand jury in connection with that
investigation.
   At a Wednesday hearing, King testified that she had forgotten
about the proceedings against her brother.
   ``The court cannot credit King's testimony that she failed to
mention her brother Sam's recent conviction by plea of guilty
because she `forgot,''' Gesell said in a nine-page ruling.
   But he said ``no proof was presented indicating that King was
unfair or that she failed in any way to serve conscientiously. She
voted to acquit North of many felony counts.''
   ``King was not biased for or against either side,'' Gesell said.
   North, who could be fined up to $750,000 and sentenced to 10
years in prison for the three felony convictions, was acquitted on
nine other charges.
   North's lawyers hired a private detective agency to investigate
King after she told a television interviewer she had used drugs but
stopped months before North's trial.
   North was convicted of aiding and abetting an obstruction of
Congress in connection with a 1985 arms shipment to Iran. He also
was convicted of destroying sensitive National Security Council
documents that detailed his assistance to the Nicaraguan Contras
when a congressional ban on military aid was in effect.
   He was convicted of accepting a $13,800 home-security system from
Iran-Contra co-defendant Richard Secord, whom North had enlisted to
run arms to the Contras.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Tom Bradley was sworn in to an
unprecedented fifth term Friday, and he promised to press ahead with
his social programs despite allegations of misconduct in office.
   Bradley, 71, was cheered at the inauguration by thousands of
supporters, whose presence displaced the homeless people who usually
recline beneath huge fig trees on the lawn.
   ``I am determined that no difficulty will deflect us,'' said
Bradley, the subject of several investigations into allegations of
financial wrongdoing, including improper ties with banks that do
business with the city.
   ``The headlines will come and go; the 30-second sound bites will
be heard and then fade and be forgotten,'' the mayor said.
   ``What will remain long after we are gone ... are the doors of
opportunity that have been opened; the air that has been cleaned;
the neighborhoods that have been given new life; a generation that
has been given new hope,'' Bradley said.
   Bradley promised increased efforts to control gangs and drug
sales, to press his plan to cut the number of trucks on city streets
during rush hour by 70 percent, and said he would soon announce a
major program to keep storm drains from polluting bay waters. The
city's overtaxed sewage system repeatedly has overflowed and spilled
into Santa Monica and San Pedro bays.
   Bradley said he would ``settle for nothing less'' than $2 billion
worth of tax increment revenues to be committed to the ``largest
municipal housing and homeless plan in American history.''
   ``There is something fundamentally wrong in Los Angeles when
10,000 parents and their children are completely homeless; when
40,000 of our families live in garages; and 150,000 pay more than
half of their income for rent.''
   Bradley has enjoyed relative popularity during his 16 years as
mayor.
   InApril's nonpartisan mayoral primary, Bradley defeated City
Councilman Nate Holden with 52 percent of the vote, just enough to
avoid a general election. A far stronger opponent, Councilman Zev
Yaroslavsky, had pulled out of the race months earlier, saying he
believed the mayor was unbeatable.
   In the previous election, Bradley was re-elected with 67 percent
of the vote.
   Bradley has failed twice in runs for governor. In his first try,
he lost to George Deukmejian in 1982 by just 1.2 percent of the vote.
   Recent newspaper reports prompted the city attorney to launch a
conflict-of-interest investigation of Bradley on March 31. The state
Fair Political Practices Commission later began its own probe.
   Questions arose about whether Bradley had exchanged political
favors for preferential treatment at Drexel Burnham Lambert, the
investment banking firm that pioneered the use of controversial
``junk bonds.''
   The U.S. Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange
Commission later opened additional investigations.
   Bradley told the City Council on May 10 that he had done nothing
illegal and would be vindicated.

<HEAD>Shevardnadze Confirmed Unanimously as Foreign Minister</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze won
unanimous confirmation from the new Soviet legislature Friday, but
lawmakers accused an economics minister of incompetence and he did
not get a majority.
   Shevardnadze was the first Cabinet member approved by the Supreme
Soviet without questioning.
   After Shevardnadze sailed through, confirmation of the nominee
for the State Foreign Economic Commission was postponed when he did
not win a majority from the 542 members, possibly because more than
100 were absent. All were present to raise their hands for
Shevardnadze.
   He went to the podium and waited for questions, but there were
none. The popular foreign minister has helped produce a nuclear arms
limitation treaty, withdrawal of the Red Army from Afghanistan and
vastly improved relations with neighbors China and Iran.
   ``The candidate's authority among parliamentarians is so high
that the decision was made without any consideration of the
candidate's program,'' said Tass, the official news agency.
   Shevardnadze and other ministers were questioned in closed
committee hearings earlier this week and the legislature exercised
veto power over top officials for the first time, forcing withdrawal
of seven nominees.
   Confirmation of Vladimir Kamentsev as a deputy premier and head
of the State Foreign Economic Commission was postponed because he
did not get the necessary 272 votes, Tass said. The vote was 246-97
with 56 abstentions.
   Only 438 legislators had signed in and many were outside the hall
when the vote on Kamentsev was called.
   ``By law, a Cabinet nominee is to earn at least 272 votes to be
endorsed,'' Tass said, and added that another vote would be taken
later.
   Kamentsev was accused of being incompetent because foreign trade
had decreased during his two years in office. Deputies said he had
no clear strategy for increasing trade and ending the Sovieet
Union's comparative isolation from the world economy.
   Tass said the legislature also was considering Vitaly Doguzhiev
as head of a new Commission on Emergencies formed to coordinate
response to disasters like the Armenian earthquake and the explosion
of leaking gas in Central Asia that engulfed two trains and killed
600 people.
   Doguzhiev has been minister of general machine-building.
   Legislators approved Nikolai Laverov as deputy premier for
science and technology and Mikhail Shkabardnya as business manager
of the Cabinet.

<HEAD>Justice Department Won't Press Charges in FBI Racial Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An investigation of allegations that white FBI
agents in Chicago racially harassed a black colleague was concluded
without any criminal charges, the Justice Department said Friday.
   The department said in a statement that it was unable to
determine who wrote and sent two ``vicious hate letters'' to Special
Agent Donald Rochon in 1985 while he was assigned to the FBI's
Chicago field office.
   ``Evidence of other activities did not establish prosecutable
federal criminal violations,'' the department said in a brief
statement.
   The finding came nearly two years after the Justice Department
found that Rochon, who is suing nine FBI agents, was the victim of
``blatant racial harassment'' while assigned to the bureau's Omaha,
Neb., field office.
   Rochon, who was subsequently assigned to the Chicago field office
from 1984 to 1986, claims in the suit that that he was the victim of
a campaign of racial harassment by white FBI agents.
   David Kairys, a Philadelphia attorney who represents Rochon,
criticized the Justice Department's decision not to bring charges,
saying the evidence he had gathered since filing the lawsuit in 1987
was ``sufficient for an indictment'' of racial harassment.
   ``The role of the Justice Department has been to cover up and
ignore this series of events,'' Kairys said.
   Rochon, now assigned to the FBI office in Philadelphia, claims
his family's safety was threatened with anonymous telephone calls to
his unlisted number and that he was threatened with dismissal if he
pressed harassment claims to state authorities.
   One letter contained threats to castrate Rochon and rape his
wife, Susan, who is white. The letter contained a picture of the
dismembered body of a black man.
   The second letter contained a picture of a bullseye with a
picture of a black man's face.
   Gary W. Miller, a white FBI agent who invoked the Fifth Amendment
during a deposition taken in connection with the lawsuit,
acknowledged during a 1985 statement to his superiors that he
discussed seeking ``retribution against Rochon'' with a colleague,
Thomas J. Dillon.
   Dillon and Miller are among nine FBI agents named as defendants
in the lawsuit pending in federal courts here and in Chicago.
   Kairys said that Miller said during the deposition that he had
been informed by the Justice Department that he was a target of the
criminal investigation.
   Kairys said an FBI test of Miller's typewriters to determine if
he had typed one of the two 1985 letters produced inconclusive
results.
   Miller stated in the 1985 affidavit that he forged Rochon's
signature on an application for a death and dismemberment policy for
the black agent's family.
   The insurance policy was mailed to Rochon's home after he
received the first hate letter, Kairys said.
   Miller, who was suspended for two weeks without pay, said he only
intended to send junk mail to Rochon. But Miller acknowledged that
he sought ``personal revenge'' against Rochon for making racial
harassment charges against Dillon when the two agents worked in
Omaha.
   ``It was my way of putting a burr under his saddle,'' Miller said
in the statement.
   Miller was suspended for two weeks without pay as a result of the
FBI internal investigation.

<HEAD>Federal Audit Says Montgomery Broker Failed to Pay HUD $2 Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KENDAL WEAVER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal prosecutors are looking into
allegations that a Montgomery real estate broker kept more than $2
million that he was supposed to send to the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development, spending nearly $180,000 on cars.
   U.S. Attorney Jim Wilson of Montgomery on Friday declined to
comment about the Alabama HUD case or the broker, identified in HUD
documents as Cy Walker. Wilson said he could not comment on pending
investigative matters, with a meeting scheduled with HUD officials
in about two weeks to review various potential cases.
   An audit said the HUD money was placed in Walker's bank account,
from which more than $1 million in checks had been written to cash,
another $179,478 went to car dealers, $75,634 to retail stores and
businesses, $238,000 to individuals or associates, and smaller
amounts to others.
   The bank account was depleted and closed on Nov. 9, 1987, the day
after Walker allegedly pulled out of the offices of Rick's
Lind-Davis Real Estate Inc. in Montgomery.
   Attempts to reach Walker for comment were unsuccessful Friday. A
Cy Walker is listed in the Montgomery residence phone book, but the
number has been disconnected. Knox Argo, a Montgomery attorney who
previously handled some closings with Walker, said he had not seen
him in about a year.
   The audit by the Office of Inspector General charged that an
associate broker with Rick's Lind-Davis Real Estate Inc. failed to
send HUD $2,011,915 from 67 sales closings that he handled for the
federal agency.
   The audit, covering from August 1984 to November 1987, also found
that the company was late in remitting to HUD another $3.89 million
from 148 sales, costing the government about $323,000 in lost
interest.
   No individuals were named in the audit. But documents in HUD's
Board of Contract Appeals case file identify Walker as the associate
broker.
   A complaint filed with the HUD appeal board by Rick's Lind-Davis
said Walker handled the HUD closings and controlled all the bank
account records and files. The qualifying broker for the firm,
Johnny M. Portis, did not learn about the missing HUD money until
after Walker abandoned the premises of the firm on Nov. 8, 1987,
taking all the HUD files with him, according to the complaint filed
by Portis' attorney.
   Joseph Carpenter, a Montgomery attorney, represents Rick's
Lind-Davis and Portis, who closed down the company's operations and
sold parts of it to another firm on Jan. 1, 1989. He said Portis did
not know about the unremitted HUD funds until after Walker left the
firm.
   According to the audit, officials with the firm said they were
not responsible for the $2,011,915 in unremitted sales proceeds. The
Rick's Lind-Davis officials, according to the audit, said the HUD
contract was with an associate broker for the firm and that, when
they purchased the company in 1986, the former owners told them that
the associate broker had the HUD account.
   Accordingly, the audit said, the Rick's Lind-Davis officials
``did not research or even review'' the contract with HUD to handle
closings ``but continued to let things operate as they were before
the purchase because their relationship with the associate broker
was one of trust.''
   The audit said that the HUD contract required the firm, as the
Area Management Broker for the federal agency, to establish an
escrow account in the name of the firm and HUD. Instead, the audit
said, the firm ``allowed an associate broker to establish a regular
commercial checking account. ... Although HUD appeared in the bank
account name, we learned that this associate broker had sole control
over the bank account.''
   ``In addition, this broker collected all proceeds from the sale
of HUD properties.''
   According to HUD officials, when the agency tried to see records
from the account, the broker refused to authorize it. The audit said
its findings were based on subpoenaed documents along with HUD
records.

<TEXT>
   The Department of Housing and Urban Development
ignored repeated warnings to take action against lenders, including
one currently under grand jury investigation, the agency's inspector
general said Friday.
   ``On at least five occasions ... we have reported to HUD
management and to Congress that program improvements were needed,''
said HUD Inspector General Paul A. Adams as the House subcommittee
on employment and housing began hearings to investigate the troubled
program.
   ``We concluded that inappropriate lender underwriting practices
caused inflated mortgages,'' as early as November 1985, Adams said.
   But he said HUD managment criticized him for overstating the
problems and rejected controls he suggested as too strict. However,
he said officials kept assuring him they were taking steps to
``improve lender monitoring processes and enforcement actions.''
   Meanwhile:
   _In Montgomery, Ala., federal attorneys are looking into
allegations that a Montgomery real estate broker kept more than $2
million that he was supposed to send to HUD, spending nearly
$180,000 on cars.
   _In Washington, Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, said ``The whole
nation is appalled _ in fact, sickened _ by the revelations of the
looting'' at HUD during the Reagan administration.
   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp is scheduled to appear July 12 before
the House banking committee which Gonzalez heads to discuss reform
measures being instituted.
   In the Senate, one staffer said Senate banking committee chairman
Donald Riegle, D-Mich., has sent a letter to panel members seeking
authorization for an investigation. Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.,
chairman of the subcommittee on housing, said Friday he would vote
for a probe of the ``scandal-ridden'' department.
   In a separate matter, Kemp late Thursday cancelled a $500 million
mortgage loan guarantee program that helped finance such things as
street construction and sewer lines for smaller developers who
included low- and moderate-income housing in their projects.
   The department found that nearly half of the 58 projects financed
through the program had defaulted on loans and cost the government
$90 million.
   ``This program was an absolute disaster, said HUD spokesman Bob
Nipp.
   The coinusrance mortgage program was started in 1983 as a
hallmark of Reagan administration efforts to ``privitize'' many
government programs.
   Under the program, private lenders offer loans for the repair,
rehabilitation or construction of low- and moderate-income
multifamily housing.
   Lenders are paid an annual fee of about 4 percent of a project's
operating income. If a loan defaults, lenders are responsible for
about 20 percent of the loss while HUD picks up the tab for the
remaining 80 percent.
   ``Claims filed against HUD as of September 1988 total over $100
million, with more claims expected in the next several months,''
said Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., subcommittee chairman.
   In his most recent program audit in March 1989, Adams found one
lender, Benton Mortgage Company, of Knoxville, Tenn., had
misrepresented mortgage amounts and rents on 14 projects it had
underwritten.
   Adams estimated Benton's mortgages were excessive by $22 million.
He also said the government would pay excessive rent subsidies of
$37 milllion over the 15-year period of contracts for rental housing
Benton had coinsured.
   Benton is one of three companies which has been placed on a
six-month probation from the program. Three companies have been
suspended indefinitely and three others are under ``close watch''
review by HUD, Adams said.
   Adams revealed Friday that Benton is the subject of a grand jury
investigation.
   When Rep. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn., asked Adams whether he was
investigating relationships between developers, consultants and
Benton Mortgage, the inspector general replied: ``I'm not at liberty
to discuss an ongoing investigation, a subject of a grand jury
investigation.''
   Morrison dropped that line of questioning when Lantos warned it
might jeopardize the grand jury's probe.
   The housing and employment subcommittee also is investigating
alleged abuse, influence-peddling and mismanagement in HUD programs
to fix up rundown housing complexes for the poor.
   Adams said his first report of problems in the coinsurance
program was sent to then-Assistant Secretary of Housing Phil Abrams,
one of several former HUD employees who was paid as a consultant on
projects funded under a HUD program.

   Maoist guerrillas set off dynamite under
a military convoy near a northern town, killing five soldiers and
wounding six, three seriously, officials said Friday.
   In Medellin, gunmen stormed a bar during a transvestite party and
fired indiscriminately Thursday night, killing three customers and
seriously wounding nine, police said.
   The bomb attack occurred Thursday near the town of Maria La Baja,
375 miles north of the capital, Bogota, as the convoy of three navy
trucks with 16 marines was passing by, according to the Colombian
South Atlantic Navy Command.
   The guerrillas detonated dynamite by remote control, destroying
one truck and slightly damaging the other two, the command said in a
report.
   It blamed the Popular Liberation Army, a pro-Mao guerrilla group,
for the attack.
   Navy marines launched an intensive search around nearby areas
immediately but could not find the guerrillas, the report said. The
search continued Friday.
   Authorities could not immediately determine who organized the
attack on the bar in Medellin, Colombia's second largest city.
   Officials believed the incident to be another chapter in the war
between the Medellin and Cali drug cartels, which control most of
the drug operations in Colombia. Fourteen people died this week in
Medellin as a result of the bloody struggle among drug bands.
   The attack may also have been committed by one of the death
squads that operate in some Colombian cities, attacking homosexuals,
drug traffickers, prostitutes, thieves and beggars.
   The fight between the two cartels is for the control of the New
York drug narcotics market, according to Colombian police sources.
More than 200 people have been killed in this war during the past 18
months, the police said.

   A communist-led alliance failed to form a
new government Friday after Premier Andreas Papandreou's socialist
party refused to join a proposed three-member governing coalition
with conservatives.
   The communist-led Coalition of Left and Progress, whose failure
follows similar attempts by the socialists and conservatives, left
open the possibility of joining with the center-right New Democracy
party of Constantine Mitsotakis.
   ``We (the Coalition) will meet tomorrow and examine the prospects
of such a government and take the proper position,'' Coalition
leader Harilaos Florakis said after meeting with President Christos
Sartzetakis.
   Negotiations on a coalition began after elections June 18 in
which New Democracy won 145 of the unicameral Parliament's 300
seats, six short of a majority, and Papandreou's Panhellenic
Socialist Movement got 125.
   The Coalition of the Left and Progress, an alliance of the
Moscow-line Communist Party and the Greek Left, a Eurocommunist
group, won 28 seats and the role of power broker. They a received a
three-day mandate ending Friday to form a government.
   Sartzetakis has a final meeting with party leaders Saturday. If
the communists and conservatives reach agreement, they could still
present a proposed coalition government to the president for
approval.
   If the parties are unable to hammer out a government acceptable
to all, Sartzetakis is to appoint a caretaker administration
composed of high court judges and non-parliamentarians to lead the
country to new elections.
   The earlier efforts by conservatives and socialists to form a
government by cooperating with the communists stumbled over
Mitsotakis' and Papandreou's insistence on being premier. The two
leaders backed down on that demand Friday.
   Papandreou is hospitalized, recovering from heart and kidney
problems.
   It was the first time in the nation's history that communists
have been given a mandate to form a government.

<HEAD>Committee Rejects Call To Let British Passport Holders in Hong Kong
Immigrate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An influential House of Commons committee rejected
calls to let 3.5 million British passport holders in Hong Kong
immigrate to Britain, and it recommended an international effort to
accommodate them in the event of a crisis.
   The Foreign Affairs Select Committee report also recommended the
speedy introduction of full democracy in Hong Kong so it would be in
place before China takes over the colony in 1997.
   Hong Kong legislators greeted the report with outrage and said
the committee's statement on the immigration issue will probably go
down as ``one of the most dishonorable statements ever made about
Hong Kong.''
   Britain's Foreign Affairs Select Committee said it was
unrealistic to expect such a large influx to be accommodated in
Britain. But it did recommend that thousands be allowed to
immigrate, especially those holding key and sensitive positions in
Hong Kong.
   ``We believe the accommodation of even several million people
from Hong Kong would be quite possible if shared amongst the
international community,'' it said.
   The committee rejected the contention of Foreign Secretary Sir
Geoffrey Howe that other countries would not now make a commitment
to take Hong Kong residents in case of a future crisis.
   It urged Britain to ``take the lead at the earliest opportunity''
_ particularly with the European Community, Australia, Canada and
the United States _ ``in establishing the definite guarantees which
could be put into place in the years ahead.''
   This idea, the Hong Kong legislators replied, betrays any
``desire by the committee to understand, let alone accept, that
there is a confidence crisis in Hong Kong now which clearly calls
for immediate action. It fails to recognize Britain's constitutional
responsibility for its subjects now or in the future.''
   The report was started before the Chinese government ordered the
army to crush the pro-democracy movement on June 3-4. But the fears
the crackdown raised in Hong Kong were at the heart of many of the
committee's recommendations.
   The Chinese government has said 200 to 300 people died in the
crackdown, but Chinese diplomats and Western intelligence reports
say up to 3,000 were killed.
   ``The Chinese government's ruthless suppression of calls within
China for progress towards democracy, and the extreme language of
its denunciation of Hong Kong support for those calls, seriously
challenges the belief that China will now and even more after 1997
encourage the development of democracy in Hong Kong,'' the committee
warned.
   It said China should provide ``stronger guarantees'' that it will
maintain Hong Kong's autonomy and capitalist system after 1997, ``to
re-establish the confidence and trust'' of the colony's 5.7 million
residents.
   The committee said Hong Kong residents must be allowed to decide
on their own system of government both before and after 1997 and
urged the introduction of full democracy ``as soon as possible.''
   It recommended that direct elections for Hong Kong's entire
Legislative Council be held in 1995 and that 50 percent of the
council be directly elected in 1990 as a first stage. Hong Kong's
first chief executive should be elected by an electoral college six
months before the transfer of sovereignty to China, it said.
   The report also called on Britain to make clear to China the
strength of Hong Kong's opposition to any stationing of People's
Liberation Army soldiers in the colony after 1997.

   President Bush stood before the Iwo Jima
statue of flag-raising Marines Friday to press for a constitutional
amendment against desecration of the American flag, ``the fabric of
our nation.''
   Bush is pushing for a proposed amendment, drafted by Republican
congressional leaders, that would set aside last week's Supreme
Court ruling that extended freedom-of-speech protection to people
who burn the flag as a form of political protest.
   ``Our purpose today transcends politics and patriotism,'' Bush
told an audience of several hundred that included many
administration officials and GOP members of Congress.
   The president praised the amendment's language as ``stark ...
simple and to the point.'' The proposal states: ``The Congress and
the states shall have power to prohibit the physical desecration of
the flag of the United States.''
   Critics have said such an amendment would open the door for
erosion of the Constitution's guarantees of freedom of speech and
have said Bush is endangering the First Amendment for political gain.
   But Bush said, ``This amendment preserves the widest conceivable
range of options for free expression. It applies only to the flag,
the unique symbol of our nation.''
   Later, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley told reporters at the White
House he prefers legislation to altering the Constitution to
accomplish what he says is a worthwhile goal.
   ``My view is that before we amend the Constitution, we should
approach the question with a statutory change,'' Foley said. ``We
have to be extraordinarily careful before we amend the First
Amendment, which is the basic foundation document for freedom of
speech, freedom of religion and freedom of the press.''
   Bush made his appearance at the Iwo Jima Memorial, a popular
landmark on the banks of the Potomac, before leaving Washington in
early afternoon for a five-day Fourth of July vacation at his family
complex in Kennebunkport, Maine.
   After the flag event, Bush met with Albertina Sisulu, a South
African anti-apartheid activist, telling her he would ask Congress
to increase aid to South African blacks, and addressed a White House
ceremony commemorating the 25th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act
of 1964.
   Bush told members of the civil rights audience they were gathered
``not only to commemorate an anniversary, but to celebrate a
movement, and to rededicate our efforts to the unfinished work of
that movement.''
   Earlier, Bush declared ``Our flag will not be desecrated'' as he
stood in bright sunlight before the bronze statue of six Marines
holding aloft a huge American flag. The flag itself is cloth and
fluttered gently in a light morning breeze.
   ``To the touch, this flag is merely fabric. But to the heart, the
flag represents and reflects the fabric of our nation _ our dreams,
our destiny, our very fiber as a people,'' Bush said.
   Joining him at the ceremony were Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole,
R-Kan., House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., and two
Democratic sponsors of the amendment, Sen. Alan J. Dixon of Illinois
and Rep. G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery of Mississippi.
   Michel said he had been promised speedy consideration of the
proposal in the House by Foley, D-Wash. To take effect, the
amendment requires approval by two-thirds majorities in both the
House and Senate and then ratification by at least 38 state
legislatures.
   On the flight to Maine, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said the administration would ``like to see it passed as soon as
possible, but I don't think we've been given any timetable for how
soon that might happen.''
   The amendment would have the effect of overturning the Supreme
Court's 5-4 decision that nullified flag-desecration statutes in 48
states.
   Dole said that there is outrage around the nation over the
ruling, that ``people are saying keep your hands off Old Glory.''
   The Iwo Jima Memorial depicts the flag raising by war-weary
Marines atop Mount Suribachi after the U.S. victory over Japanese
forces in the World War II battle of Iwo Jima, a small volcanic
island in the Pacific.
   ``These Marines wrote a profile in courage,'' said Bush, who as a
World War II Navy pilot was shot down in the Pacific not far from
Iwo Jima.
   ``Today, we remember one of the most vivid images of our flag _
the one you see behind me _ Joe Rosenthal's stunning photograph
immortalized in bronze.'' Rosenthal was a photographer for The
Associated Press when he snapped the Pulitzer Prize-winning image in
1945.
   The only surviving Marine from the group, John Bradley, of
Antigo, Wis., said after the court decision, ``I couldn't believe my
ears when I heard they ruled that way.''
   Bradley said in a June 23 Milwaukee Sentinel story: ``The flag is
a symbol of our country that everyone holds dear to their hearts. I
couldn't understand how they came to that decision.''
   Bradley, a funeral director in his small northern Wisconsin town,
said, ``We ought to have the utmost respect for the flag, the symbol
of a free nation.''
   He said he has buried people who fought under the flag, and he
added, ``When taps are played, I think everyone feels the same way,
with chills running up and down your spine.''
   Bush was to remain at his oceanside home in Kennebunkport through
Wednesday morning. Aides said he had no public appearances scheduled
and that the trip was mainly for rest and relaxation.
   However, a large crowd was expected to gather at various
beachfront locations at dusk the night before Independence Day to
watch a fireworks display at Bush's complex at Walkers Point.
   Famed fireworks artist George Zambelli was hired by an anonymous
benefactor to put on what he says will be a 15-minute performance
that will expend about two tons of fireworks.

   Jim Wright's 34 years in Congress ended Friday,
and an 18-wheel truck loaded with the possessions of the former
Speaker of the House pulled away from the Capitol en route to Texas.
   Hours before Wright's resignation took effect, workers stripped
bare his office.
   Tarps covered the carpet to catch drops of paint and workers on
scaffolding took down light fixtures to prepare the office for the
arrival of its new occupant, Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash.
   The Texas Democrat resigned his leadership post and congressional
seat after a yearlong ethics investigation into his personal
financial dealings.
   He left the Speaker's job June 6, but kept his 12th District seat
until the close of business Friday.
   Wright said his goodbyes in Washington on Thursday before flying
home to Fort Worth, where he attended a party with about 3,000
supporters.
   Wright's furniture, drapes, papers and plaques were loaded Friday
onto a 65-foot-long truck headed for Texas Christian University.
Marshall Lynam, Wright's chief of staff, said the university would
use the furnishings to create ``a simulated speaker's office.''
   Members of Congress are allowed to buy their desk and chair for
$100 when they retire, and the law allows former House speakers to
use their furniture in an office in their congressional district.
   University spokeswoman Betty Knox said office space would be made
available to Wright at the school library ``so he can work on his
papers there.''
   Outside the Capitol Friday, movers packed box after box of
pictures and plaques.
   The truck also held a credenza and bookcase, an upholstered couch
and two wingback chairs, a jogging trampoline, boxed draperies,
bookshelves and a crate marked ``Jim Wright Sculpture.''

<HEAD>Iran's Rafsanjani Stresses Importance of Relations With Moscow</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran's Parliament speaker, Hashemi
Rafsanjani, said Friday that the Islamic Republic's relations with
the Soviet Union could have an important impact in the region and in
the world, Tehran radio reported.
   Rafsanjani, considered the most powerful man in Iran and likely
to be elected president in July 28 elections, headed a high-ranking
delegation to the Soviet Union this month.
   ``We have many natural resources and the Soviets have many means,
which together can benefit both countries,'' the radio, monitored in
Nicosia, quoted him as saying in a sermon.
   In Baghdad, Iraq, the Soviet first deputy foreign minister,
Alexander A. Bessmertnykh, arrived Friday on a previously
unannounced visit, apparently seeking to calm Iraqi concern at
Moscow's military and economic agreements with Iran.
   Soviet Embassy officials said he met his Iraqi counterpart,
Wissam al-Zahawi, and was due to have talks with Foreign Minister
Tareq Aziz later.
   He is expected to meet with President Saddam Hussein before
flying back to Moscow Sunday.
   Bessmertnykh told reporters he carried a letter from Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev for Saddam, but declined to disclose
its contents.
   Iran needs outside help to replenish its depleted military
hardware and to rebuild industries destroyed in the 8-year Iran-Iraq
war, which was halted last August by a U.N.-brokered cease-fire.
   Iranian diplomat Sirous Nasseri told a news conference at U.N.
headquarters in New York Friday that Iran-Iraq talks were making no
progress and a settlement was further away now than when
U.N.-mediated talks began 10 months ago.
   Francois Giuliani, spokesman for Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar, later denied no progress had been made, saying in answer
to a question that ``obviously the secretary-general would not
continue a process which is moving backward and which is useless.''
   Tehran Radio quoted Rafsanjani as saying Friday that if Iran and
the Soviet Union ``can have relations like two free countries,
without expectations or an eye to taking advantage of each other,
there will be a security under which we can regain many of the
usurped interests of the region, and that is why the Westerners are
horrified.''
   He justified undertaking the Soviet trip so soon after Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini's death on June 3 by saying the revolutionary
patriarch had himself given the blessing to better relations with
the Soviets.
   Rafsanjani recounted the long-term, $6 billion pact signed in
Moscow, whereby the Soviets will help Iran in oil exploration, prop
up its arms industry, and build dams, power plants and railways in
return for exports of Iranian natural gas.
   He said Soviet troop withdrawal from Afghanistan last February
and more religious freedoms in the Soviet Union had been conducive
to better relations between Moscow and Tehran, the radio reported.

<TEXT>
   The venerable Treaty Oak, withering from a
powerful poison poured on its roots, will live on through seedlings
grown by a man who picnicked beneath its branches as a child.
   Gordon Israel, who lives across the street from the centuries-old
oak, has about 80 seedlings grown from acorns he gathered last year
in what was to be a business venture.
   ``I don't know what to do now,'' Israel said Friday, adding that
he didn't want to capitalize on the poisoning.
   Police on Thursday arrested Paul Cullen, 45, and charged him with
felony criminal mischief in the pouring of the herbicide Velpar
around the tree. Cullen was being held in lieu of $20,000 bond.
   ``If something does happen that the Treaty Oak isn't saved or
something, I would hope that some of these seedlings would end up in
that park,'' said Israel, 37. The oak stands in a small park near
downtown Austin.
   Authorities said the poisoning may have occurred during some sort
of ritual. Sgt. John Jones, who investigated the case, said
``ritual-related items'' and occult books were found in a search of
Cullen's makeshift trailer south of Austin in Elroy.
   Israel said he is optimistic about survival of the tree, which
has a special significance for him. He chose his home because it is
near the 50-foot oak and said he remembers stories of Stephen F.
Austin and the tree on a grade-school visit to the park.
   Legend says Austin, a founding father of Texas, signed the first
boundary line agreement between Indians and settlers under the oak's
branches. But the Handbook of Texas says there is little foundation
for the tale.
   Israel said that since the poisoning became public, ``A lot of
people have really shown that they care, and that's real neat. I
guess that's the most positive thing that you can draw from this
whole experience.''
   Get-well messages, flowers and a can of cream-of-chicken soup are
among the items that have been left at the tree.
   Israel has given away some seedlings since the poisoning,
including one to a couple married at the oak.
   The Treaty Oak is struggling to survive the poisoning. Since it
was discovered early this month, state and national experts have
recommended several forms of treatment, but it was not known if the
tree would live.
   Those experts also have advised Israel on caring for the
seedlings, he said.

<HEAD>Tentative Agreement On Driftnet Treaty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and Taiwan initialed a
tentative North Pacific driftnet agreement Friday just hours after
the Taiwanese were given 60 days to sign and implement such a pact
or face possible trade sanctions on their fishery products.
   The agreement allows for the ``high seas boarding'' of Taiwanese
driftnet vessels suspected of illegally catching U.S. salmon and
requires the placement of satellite transponders on all of the 166
Taiwanese ships involved.
   The United States will use the transponders to keep track of the
Taiwanese fleet, and U.S. observers will be allowed to board
Taiwanese vessels to monitor their catch.
   ``We drove a hard bargain and got what looks like a workable
agreement,'' said Rep. Jolene Unsoeld, D-Wash. ``Clearly the threat
of sanctions gave Taiwan the incentive to work something out.''
   The agreement was reached shortly after midnight Friday and
initialed Friday afternoon, said Brian Gorman, a spokesman for the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
   Secretary of Commerce Robert Mosbacher had told President Bush
late Thursday that efforts to reach agreement with Taiwan and South
Korea over the use of the driftnets by their fishing fleets had
failed.
   Under a 1987 law, Thursday was the deadline for reaching and
implementing such monitoring and enforcement agreements. A 60-day
time clock started running and if agreements were still not in force
by the end of that period, the administration could impose an
embargo or other trade sanctions on Taiwanese and Korean fishery
products.
   Taiwanese exports to the United States, mostly tuna and shrimp,
were valued at $372 million last year and Korean exports, mostly
pollock and oysters, were valued at $250 million.
   Gorman said that once the treaty is formally signed and
implemented Mosbacher would ask Bush to lift the threat of trade
sanctions against Taiwan.
   State Department officials have said talks with the Koreans may
resume in July, but no definite date has been set. A previous round
of talks with the Koreans in May failed to produce any progress.

<HEAD>Government Announces Price And Wage Freeze ^With AM-Poland Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government froze wages and prices
Friday for a month, citing a ``race'' between the two that
threatened further crisis in an already chaotic economy.
   The moratorium will allow the new National Assembly, which
includes members from the Solidarity oppsition movement, to convene
and begin work on economic reform.
   ``Because of the significance and the social effects of the new
market orientation,'' the economy ``should be a subject of
consideration by the newly elected parliament,'' said a statement
released after a Cabinet meeting led by Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F.
Rakowski.
   Among proposals awaiting legislative action is the indexing of
wages to prices, under which pay increases would cover 80 percent of
inflation. Indexing was agreed upon in negotiations between the
government and opposition that ended in April.
   Inflation is officially projected at 60 percent for 1989, but is
running at an annual rate of more than 100 percent.
   ``To stop the fatal tendencies of the economy, the Council of
Ministers decided to take radical actions to end the race of price
and pay,'' the Cabinet statement said.
   The freeze follows sharp price increases for some state-produced
goods, including 66 percent for sugar and an average 83 percent for
tobacco products. Prices of alcoholic beverages, gasoline and
appliances also went up.
   Speculation about the possibility of other price increases,
especially for meat, led producers to withhold goods, making
shortages worse.
   In moving toward a market-oriented economy, the government wants
to narrow the gap between production costs and prices, which
previously were kept artificially low by subsidies.
   The Cabinet noted ``alarming phenomena'' in crop and animal
production due to continuing declines in profits for farmers, which
it said ``threatens a serious destabilization of the food market in
the second half of the year.''

   The Federal Communications Commission cleared
the way Friday for a historic change in the way prices are
established by the nation's largest long-distance provider, the
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
   The commission denied challenges by AT&amp;T competitors and the
state of Alaska to a new pricing method that goes into effect
Saturday.
   The new plan, which the FCC adopted in March following two years
of debate, imposes caps on how much AT&amp;T can charge. Since the
1960s, the FCC has regulated how much AT&amp;T could earn above its
costs.
   The FCC, which has said the new ``price cap'' plan could save
telephone users $900 million over four years, on Friday rejected
assertions by the challengers that AT&amp;T had failed to provide enough
evidence to justify its new pricing schedule and that AT&amp;T had
calculated certain rates improperly.
   The challengers wanted the FCC to fully investigate the inaugural
price cap plan, which AT&amp;T claims will lower prices $140 million
immediately _ $100 million for residential customers.
   AT&amp;T said it will lower charges for its basic long-distance
rates, its Reach Out America service and for international calling.
   One of the challengers, the Competitive Telecommunications
Association (Comptel), claimed AT&amp;T was achieving the $140 million
cut, not by price caps but by ``flowing through'' to its customers
previously ordered FCC price cuts.
   Under the old rate-of-return regulatory system, AT&amp;T's
long-distance rates have dropped 38 percent since 1984. But much of
that decrease has resulted from higher prices consumers have been
paying to connect to local telephone networks.
   With consumers paying more, long-distance companies have paid
less to the local telephone networks, and the FCC has forced AT&amp;T to
pass along _ flow through _ those savings to its long-distance
customers.
   In rejecting the challenges Friday, the commission said AT&amp;T had
complied with its April price cap order in setting the new rates and
it was not flowing through savings.
   The commission said it found some ``deficiencies'' in AT&amp;T
documents supporting its new prices but that the flaws were ``not so
serious as to warrant investigation.''
   ``The tariff will therefore not be set for investigation,'' said
Gerald Brock, chief of the commission's common carrier bureau.
   Besides Comptel the challengers were Alascom Inc., Allnet
Communications Services Inc., US Sprint Communications Co. and the
National Telecommunications Network. The state of Alaska had joined
Alascom in challenging the rates for service to Alaska.
   Earlier in the week the commission also rejected challenges to
price caps filed by the Puerto Rico Telephone Co. and La Telefonica
Larga Distancia, a Puerto Rican long-distance company. The
commission had denied the Puerto Rican companies' claims that price
caps were not in the public interest.
   The price cap plan allows AT&amp;T, which in 1988 controlled 68
percent of the U.S. long-distance market, to raise rates 3
percentage points less than the rate of inflation in three
categories of service: residential and small business; 800 calls;
and other business services, mainly for large customers.
   AT&amp;T can raise or lower rates up to 5 percent for individual
services within these categories by giving 14 days notice to the
FCC, which will presume the changes to be lawful. The burden of
proof then would be on challengers to prove the changes were illegal.
   If rate changes fall outside the price cap parameters, then the
FCC will investigate.
   The FCC has said the plan is intended to give AT&amp;T an incentive
to cut costs.
   The commission also has proposed to impose price caps on the
seven Bell regional phone companies beginning in July 1990.

<TEXT>
   Iraq's ``reconstruction army'' of 20,000 men has
moved on to Faw after rebuilding Basra, the southern provincial
capital devastated in eight years of war with Iran.
   Kamal Yaqoub, a former soldier who helped recapture Faw last
year, is among those who will rebuild the southern oil town on the
west bank of the Shatt-al-Arab waterway, the southern boundary
between the two countries.
   Faw has been renamed City of Sacrifice and the Gate of Great
Victory.
   ``I felt I'd left my duty half done last time I was here,'' the
31-year-old veteran said. ``I'm here now to complete it.''
   Yaqoub, an agronomist before the war, has the job of landscaping
parks and palm groves in the new town.
   He and the others have thousands of bulldozers, graders,
mechanical diggers, mobile cranes, cement mixers and trucks to help
with the work in blistering heat that reaches 120 degrees Fahrenheit.
   They moved to Faw last week from Basra, the ancient port 70 miles
to the north, where they had worked around the clock for three
months.
   Iraq claims the Iranians suffered more than 120,000 casualties in
the Faw battles and acknowledges 50,000 of its own. The government
has said the reconstruction underlines Iraq's quest for peace with
its Persian Gulf neighbor.
   Faw was a dusty oil-terminal town with a population of about
50,000 when the war began in September 1980. The Iraqis plan to
rebuild it as a modern city.
   Iran captured Faw in February 1986 after a 42-day battle. Yaqoub,
a reserve officer, was with the 10th Armored Division, which took
the town back in a quick offensive in April 1988.
   A U.N.-mediated cease-fire took effect Aug. 20. Yaqoub was
discharged after that and volunteered for the rebuilding project.
   ``Our duty is to breath life again into these dead palm trees and
construct some green areas in the new town,'' he said on Wednesday,
when reporters visited Faw.
   Officials said more than 2 million of Iraq's 16 million people
had volunteered to work and more than 3 million had contributed
money to the project, which is expected to cost hundreds of millions
of dollars. The government also is seeking donations from abroad.
   Officials said thousands of students are expected to join the
reconstruction project during summer vacation.

<HEAD>SES Wants Raises For All</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The head of an association representing senior
federal executives said Friday the group will ``vigorously oppose''
any pay raise proposal which fails to provide an across-the-board
increase for all members of the Senior Executive Service.
   President Bush said in a speech Thursday that he would ``work
with Congress on the development of details for increasing the pay
of those in Congress as well as other senior employees of the
executive branch.''
   A fact sheet released by the White House said Bush will send to
Congress in the next few days a package that will include a 25
percent pay increase for judges as well as an increase for a limited
number of specialized professionals such as scientists and surgeons.
   Strong criticism of that initial phase of the pay raise plan came
from Carol A. Bonosaro, president of the Senior Executives
Association.
   She said the group was ``adamantly opposed to any pay proposal
that calls for pay increases only for selective positions within the
Senior Executive Service scientific and technical community and for
the federal judiciary.''
   ``While we understand the extraordinary difficulty of retaining
and recruiting senior scientists and surgeons, we will vigorously
oppose any pay increase proposal that does not call for an
across-the-board increase for all Senior Executive Service
positions,'' Ms. Bonosaro said.
   Alixe Glen, a White House spokeswoman, said it was premature for
anyone to criticize the president because Bush has made no formal
announcement of a specific pay raise proposal.
   ``The president hasn't decided what exactly he would like to see
happen regarding an executive branch pay raise,'' Ms. Glen said.
   White House officials have said Bush wants to put out his
specific proposal before he leaves for Europe July 9.

<HEAD>Court Lifts Ban on Justice Department Drug Testing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court Friday lifted a ban on
drug testing for Justice Department employees who have top-secret
security clearances.
   However, the court left intact a permanent injunction on random
drug testing for Justice Department lawyers responsible for
conducting grand jury proceedings and employees who prosecute
criminal cases.
   The court suggested that the department consider limiting testing
to personnel who handle drug prosecutions.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said the department would
consider seeking further court review of ``parts of the opinion with
which we disagree'' or to refocus the program.
   The department's plans for random drug testing covered about
1,300 employees with top-secret clearances, as well as about 400
criminal prosecutors and 750 personnel with access to grand jury
information.
   In a decision written by Chief U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
Judge Patricia Wald, the court rejected the department's request to
lift the injunction issued by a federal district court last summer.
   The injunction resulted from a lawsuit by 38 Justice Department
attorneys.
   Wald said U.S. Supreme Court decisions require the injunction to
be modified to permit testing of employees with top-secret
clearances.
   The Supreme Court, in a drug-testing case involving the U.S.
Customs Service, said the government had a compelling interest in
protecting truly sensitive information.
   The department argued that the duties of its workers covered by
the drug-testing plan raised comparable public safety concerns as
those in the Customs Service and on railroads, where drug testing
has been upheld.
   ``We do not agree,'' Wald wrote. ``Certainly a blunder by a
Justice Department lawyer may lead, through a chain of ensuing
circumstances, to a threat to public safety.
   ``That sort of indirect risk, however, is wholly different from
the risk posed by a worker who carries a gun or operates a train.''
   Wald was joined in the opinion by Judge Spottswood Robinson.
Judge Laurence Silberman dissented to part of the decision.

<TEXT>
   An American diplomat has been ordered to leave
Czechoslovakia for what communist authorities said was his
participation in public demonstrations, the State Department said
Friday.
   While rejecting the charges against Robert Norman, a political
officer in charge of monitoring human rights, the department said
his ouster was a ``clear-cut case'' of retaliation for the expulsion
last week of a Czechoslovak diplomat here.
   ``Despite Mr. Norman's expulsion, we will continue to monitor
carefully the human rights situation in Czechoslovakia,'' the
department said in a statement.
   The Czechoslovak diplomat, Jan Fejgl, a first secretary at the
Czechoslovak Embassy here, had been caught in an act of espionage,
the statement said.
   Norman, who was due to leave Prague for another assignment in
about a month, was accused of acting in a manner inconsistent with
Czechoslovak law.
   The State Department disagreed. ``Mr. Norman acted at all times
in accordance with internationally accepted diplomatic practice,''
the statement said.
   It added that a replacement for the ousted official would be sent
to Prague shortly.
   The FBI said Fejgl, 36, was detained May 27 after he was seen
receiving Defense Department documents from a staff member of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
   The Senate staff member alerted the FBI after Fejgl approached
him about obtaining classified documents, the FBI said. Fejgl came
to Washington last September to begin what was to have been a
four-year tour of duty, the FBI said.

   A judge on Friday gave custody of an
orphaned toddler Friday to his mother's longtime female companion,
rather than the boy's blood relatives.
   ``I have been co-parenting Collin,'' Susan Bellemare, 33, told a
Vermont probate judge as she fought to win custody of the
15-month-old. ``I would parent the child, I would love him, nurture
him.''
   Bellemare was named guardian of Collin Hamilton in the will of
Susan Hamilton, who died in a car accident in May. Hamilton's
parents are challenging the will, claiming they or Hamilton's
sister, Kathleen, would be a better guardian.
   No one involved in the case would characterize the relationship
of the two women, who owned a home together and reportedly exchanged
wedding rings. They were companions for a dozen years and lived
together while raising the baby, who was conceived by artificial
insemination.
   ``We're not trying to cast aspersions on anybody,'' said Patrick
Monaghan Jr., lawyer for the grandparents, Philip and Elsa Hamilton
of Montvale, N.J. ``The person forgotten in this proceeding is the
child and what is in the best interests of the child.''
   The grandparents attended Friday's hearing, but did not testify.
Susan Hamilton's brother, Tom, called the decision disgusting.
``This other Susan, she is not even blood,'' he said.
   Judge L. John Cain awarded temporary custody to Bellemare,
allowing the grandparents visitation rights, after asking Bellemare
about her health and her ability to raise the child on her own.
   Bellemare, who was injured in the accident that killed Hamilton,
used a cane to walk to the witness stand. She said she saw a doctor
two weeks ago who told her ``to get on with my life.''
   ``I'm back at work, I'm driving,'' said Bellemare, a nurse. ``I'm
back at home and able to provide for the child.''
   Bellemare, Hamilton and the baby were returning from a weekend
trip in May when their car was struck by a truck.
   Another hearing was set for August. Attorneys representing the
boy's grandparents would not say whether they planned to appeal the
judge's temporary custody order.
   Still to be determined is whether the will is valid, and thus
whether Bellemare is the legal guardian. If the will is accepted,
Cain said later, the grandparents would then have to petition the
probate court if they wanted to set aside the guardianship.

<HEAD>Man Boycotts Postal Service Because He Wants Door, Not Curbside,
Delivery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SUMTER, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom
of night stays the U.S. Postal Service from delivering mail to John
Geddings, but Geddings' one-man protest has had an effect.
   Geddings said he stopped doing business with the postal service
five years ago when it raised the price of stamps to 22 cents, and
he's not about to start mailing or getting letters now.
   He pays his utility bills in person, no longer has credit cards
and doesn't receive a single piece of junk mail.
   ``I just buy what I need and I don't have to buy a 25-cent stamp
to send payments in,'' Geddings said Friday. ``The postal service is
the one that's losing. They have to return my mail to the sender.''
   Geddings' battle with the post office began in 1984, when he
received a letter from the U.S. Postal Service asking him to
voluntarily put up a mailbox by the curb.
   ``They said it would help curtail postage costs and help prevent
rate increases,'' said Geddings, who had had mail delivered to his
door for 28 years.
   He complied, but 30 days later the cost of stamps went from 20
cents to 22 cents. Geddings pulled out his mailbox. His mail
delivery stopped.
   Postmaster Earl Reese said postal service policy prohibits door
delivery in areas that have curbside delivery. Although putting up a
curbside box is voluntary, once a box goes up, door delivery cannot
be reinstated unless the resident is handicapped.
   ``We did eveything we could'' to get Geddings mail to him, Reese
said. ``In fact, we offered to come out and furnish the post and
mailbox. It's unusual for us to do that.
   ``We hate to have an unsatisfied customer,'' Reese added. ``I'm
really embarrassed about it.''
   In an effort to accommodate Geddings, the local post office held
his mail longer than the customary 60 days. But he wouldn't pick it
up, Reese said.
   And when postal officials tried to put Geddings' mail in his
wife's post office box _ which she rents for herself and her son _
Geddings asked them to stop.
   ``She don't exactly go along with my idea and I try not to get
her involved,'' Geddings said.
   His protests didn't end there. He wrote to postal officials,
including the U.S. Postmaster General's office in Washington, and to
South Carolina's two U.S. senators, Strom Thurmond and Ernest
Hollings.
   In 1988, without a satisfactory response and still without door
delivery, Geddings erected a sign in his front yard to call
attention to his one-man war against the postal service.
   ``The Postal Service Refuses to Deliver Mail to This Home,'' the
sign reads in bold letters.
   Reese said that's not necessarily true.
   ``I would still go out there and put his mailbox up at the curb
if it would make him happy,'' he said. ``I would like to have him
back as a customer.''
   He said the curbside delivery method is safer, faster and more
economical. But Geddings said his neighborhood has been singled out
because ``I guess they think we're second class citizens or
something.''
   ``You can go ... to the high-rent district and see them taking
mail to the door,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The military government, explaining recent
arrests, on Friday accused the leading opposition party of creating
unrest.
   Also Friday, fighting raged around a Karen guerrilla base near
the Thai border in a government offensive that left at least 25
Burmese troops and two rebels dead this week, Thai border police
said.
   As part of an intensified crackdown on dissent, authorities on
Tuesday and Wednesday arrested four student leaders and four
politicians, including a senior member of the National League for
Democracy.
   ``The National League for Democracy has been systematically
creating unrest,'' chief government spokesman, Kyaw Sann, told a
news conference. He claimed League leaders Aung San Suu Kyi and Tin
Oo have been urging people ``to defy the laws as a duty'' during
their political campaigning.
   ``We warn them again that they will have to bear the consequences
of such irresponsible acts,'' the spokesman said.
   The League on Friday attacked the recent arrests as
``manifestation of political persecution'' by the military rulers
who seized control of power last September and brutally crushed a
student-led, pro-democracy uprising.
   The government has allowed formation of opposition parties and
promised elections next year. But the League and other opposition
groups have charged the government is creating a climate of fear and
repression that will make free elections impossible.
   The Thai border police, speaking anonymously, said Friday's
fighting occurred around the Karen rebel camp of Pa Loo, which
Burmese troops attacked Tuesday, killing at least two rebels and
wounding 14 others.
   The attack left at least 25 troops dead and 35 others wounded,
the police said.
   Several thousand Burmese soldiers backed by heavy mortar and
artillery fire began attacking Pa Loo and nearby Kaw Moo Ra in May.
   The Karen rebels, with about 8,000 armed fighters, are the
largest of a dozen ethnic groups that have fought for four decades
for greater autonomy in Burma.
   Thai military sources said about 185 Burmese soldiers had been
killed and and at least 470 wounded in attacks before June 15 on Kaw
Moo Ra and Pa Loo. They reported only six Karens killed and 17
wounded.
   About 1,000 Karen civilians living near the battle zones have
fled to Thailand since the fighting for the two bases began. More
than 250 Thais have been forced to flee their homes in the village
of Ban Wang Kaew, across the border from Kaw Moo Ra.
   Karen sources said this week that the Burmese had recently
strengthened their assault force to 5,000 men. They had also
bolstered mortar positions in the hills to the west of the two
camps, they said.

   XAI-XAI, Mozambique (AP) _ A platoon of 26 rebels, most of them
boys, went on a patrol to hunt for food and instead surrendered to
the military, the national news agency AIM said Friday.
   AIM said the platoon, led by 18-year-old Joaquim Romao and
consisting mostly of boys aged eight to 14, surrendered Tuesday in
the town of Manjacaze, in the southern province of Gaza. It said the
rebels sought out a well-known local traditional healer and asked
him to make contact with the army.
   The government has said hundreds of rebels of the Mozambique
National Resistance have surrended since an amnesty law was passed
in December 1987.
   The resistance has been fighting the Marxist government for 12
years. The guerrillas first were aided by the white government of
Rhodesia, then by South Africa. No government acknowledges helping
the guerrillas, who are accused of destroying villages, burning
crops, mutilating peasants and abducting children and women to carry
looted goods.
   AIM quoted Romao as saying his group left a base at Chococha in
Inhambane province to seek food in nearby villages, but instead
crossed into Gaza and sought out the healer, Mungoi, who has been
reported in the past to have contacts with the guerrillas.
   ``We were tired of suffering in the bush, so we decided to
surrender,'' Romao was quoted as saying. Mungoi collected the
rebels' weapons and sent a messenger to the army at Manjacazi, who
came to accept the surrender, AIM said.
   Romao said his group had numbered 27, but one ran away when he
saw the soldiers coming. The guerrillas were taken to the Gaza
provincial capital of Xai-Xai, where they were seen by AIM.

   Lockheed Corp. agreed Friday to pay a $1.49
million fine levied against its Burbank, Calif., plant for health

   It is the largest penalty levied in California for such
violations, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration said

   ``The safety and health of workers must always come first, and
today's agreement is an understanding of and a promise to correct
the health and safety problems in the plant,'' Mrs. Dole said.
   The OSHA citations, issued in March for 440 alleged violations,
came after workers complained that the company failed to tell
employees of the nature of the chemicals with which they were
working. Workers also said the company mislabeled or failed to label
containers as required by OSHA.
   Other violations included failure to record or improperly
recording injuries and illnesses.
   The agreement was signed by officials of Lockheed Aeronautical

   Showers and thunderstorms continued in western Louisiana and
coastal and extreme eastern sections of Texas. Flash flood watches
were posted in both states.
   Showers and thunderstorms also extended from Arkansas and
Tennessee to Florida and Georgia. A thunderstorm and high winds
southeast of Mobile, Ala., blew the window out of a store.
   Showers and thunderstorms were in eastern Minnesota, northwestern
Wisconsin, north central Kansas and eastern Nebraska, where a

<HEAD>Supplemental $3.5 Billion Appropriations Bill Signed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush signed into law Friday a bill
providing $3.5 billion in emergency funds for several government
programs that were running short, notably the medical services of
the Veterans Department, the White House announced.
   The Veterans Department gets $1.2 billion for the rest of the
current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. Some $340 million goes to
medical programs to avoid curtailment of services.
   The rest of the veterans' money is an annual routine supplemental
appropriation made every year for pensions, loans and other benefits.
   The department announced earlier that once the bill was signed,
it would lift its ban on treatment of veterans' medical problems not
connected to their military service for veterans earning more than
$16,467 per year.
   Some closed alcohol and drug units now can be reopened and 96
construction projects recently completed can now be put into service.
   Other items in the bill include $900 million for the federally
guaranteed student loan program, $342 million to cover the cost of
fighting last summer's forest fires, another annual routine
supplemental, $423 million for foster care and adoption services,
$225 million for food stamps, $90 million for aid to the unemployed
and $10 million in aid to refugees from the Soviet Union, Eastern
Europe, Asia and Africa.
   The bill had contained $821 million in additional funds for
anti-drug programs, but faced with a veto threat and the White House
argument that federal agencies had all the money they could use this
year, Congress reduced that sum to $75 million.

   In the dog-eat-dog world of Washington
politics, the publishers of ``The Washingtonian'' magazine decided
Friday to dine on a little crow for calling the presidential pet the
ugliest canine in the capital.
   ``Before you go away for the July 4th weekend, we would like to
apologize for picking Millie the ugliest dog in Washington'' Editor
John A. Limpert said in a letter delivered Friday to the White
House. He also sent a gift of dog biscuits to the offended beast.
   ``You'll be pleased to know that our mail and phone calls are
running about 99 to 1 in favor of Millie,'' he said. ``It's clear
that our words were unpopular as as well as impolite.''
   President Bush jotted off a note in response: ``Not to worry!
Millie, you see, likes publicity. ... Arf, arf for the dog
biscuits.''
   Millie, an English springer spaniel whose confinement and
delivery of a litter of pups kept Barbara Bush and the rest of the
country in suspense earlier this year, was listed in a ``Best and
Worst'' story in the magazine's July issue.
   The magazine called Millie the ``White House mutt.''
   Mrs. Bush promised this week that Millie would get the last word
in a book the first lady planned to ghostwrite for the pet. Bush
called Millie beautiful and said, ``I know how Franklin Roosevelt
felt with the attack on Fala,'' his dog.
   Limpert said the story was put together by an editor who does not
own a dog.
   ``However, our publisher, Phillip Merrill, and I do have dogs,
and we understand very well that they are a lot like children,''
Limpert said. ``Nobody should be told they have an ugly one of
either.''

   President Bush on Friday signed a bill
extending until April 1 the government's legal authority to operate
the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
   The reserve contains 570 million barrels of crude oil, almost a
three-months supply of imports, in salt domes along the Texas and
Louisiana coasts.
   The bill requires the Secretary of Energy to study different
financing arrangements for expanding the reserve to 1 billion
barrels. The current goal is 750 million barrels, and the new law
authorizes additions at 60,000 to 75,000 barrels per day.
   Also studied will be the issue of when the oil can be used.
Current law permits the president to draw on the reserve only in the
event of a major disruption in imports. A disruption in domestic
supplies such as the interruption of shipments from Alaska after the
March grounding of the tanker Exxon Valdez there would not permit a
president to use the stockpile even if it were desirable.
   ``I would have preferred a simple 5-year extension of the SPR
authority,'' Bush said in a statement.
   The reserve is aimed at cushioning the impact of any disruption
of oil imports such as those of 1973 and 1979. The government has
spent $6 billion buying oil for the salt domes since 1975, most of
it from Mexico.

obstructing the CIA's inspector general and the Tower Commission
looking into the Iran-Contra scandal. Fernandez also is accused of
making false statements.
   Thursday night's reception was held at Rebozo's Key Biscayne,
Fla., home to raise funds for the Joe Fernandez Legal Defense Fund,
according to a statement issued in Miami by a congressional

   North was the principal speaker at the private event attended by
more than 100 people, according to Perez' statement.
   Rebozo and Nixon were neighbors on Key Biscayne.
   Perez is running for the seat of the late Claude Pepper.

<HEAD>Judge Overturns Parental Consent Law for Abortions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Friday overturned a
state law requiring girls age 17 or under to get their parents'
permission for an abortion, saying the statute was
``unconstitutionally vague.''
   The law, passed by the Legislature in 1988, was to take effect
Saturday.
   ``The statute's vagueness can be expected to have a substantial
chilling effect upon a minor's right to obtain an abortion,'' said
U.S. District Judge John T. Nixon in ruling from the bench after
about an hour of oral arguments.
   The national Planned Parenthood Federation and the American Civil
Liberties Union of Tennessee challenged the law, seeking a
preliminary injunction blocking its enforcement until the issue
could be decided.
   But Nixon said there was no need for an injunction and further
hearings because the statute is ``unconstitutionally vague on its
face.''
   The law would have made it a misdemeanor for a doctor to perform
an abortion on a minor without first obtaining written permission
from both her parents or her legal guardian.
   The statute allows exceptions, however, if the parents are
divorced; if the pregnant girl wins a court waiver of the consent
requirement; or if one parent cannot be found ``within a reasonable
time and manner.''
   ``The phrase `reasonable time and manner' is so vague as to fail
to give the physician notice as to when his actions will violate the
statute and subject him to criminal sanctions,'' Nixon said. That
violates the doctor's right to due process under the 14th Amendment,
he said.
   Nixon said uncertainty about the law's meaning would lead doctors
to protect themselves by denying abortions to minors who can't
locate one of their parents.
   ``The judge ruled on every single ground on which we alleged the
law was unconstitutional,'' said Dara Klassel, attorney for Planned
Parenthood.
   Klassel argued that the two-parent requirement was too broad when
one parent doesn't live in the girl's home. ``A parent can stall the
abortion by mere lack of interest,'' she said.
   Deputy Attorney General Michael Catalano said the state will
consider an appeal to the 6th Circuit Court after reviewing the
ruling.
   ``It's our contention that the statute is constitutional,'' he
said. ``We intend to pursue the case to that end.''
   Catalano said the case could be affected by a forthcoming ruling
from the U.S. Supreme Court, which has been asked to reverse its
landmark 1973 decision that women have a constitutional right to
abortion.
   The justices could rule Monday or order another round of
arguments, delaying the decision until next year.
   In Florida earlier this week, a lawyer told the state Supreme
Court that privacy laws should be extended to minors to allow them
an abortion without parental consent.
   The Florida law requires unmarried minors to get permission from
their parents or a judge before having an abortion. The case being
argued began when attorney Jerri Blair's client, a 15-year-old known
only as ``T.W.'' did not want to tell her parents about her
pregnancy _ then in its 11th week _ and sought judicial permission
for an abortion.
   A Lake County judge denied her request last month, saying the
state law was vague and unworkable. An appeals court then ruled the
law unconstitutional and a series of legal maneuvers landed the case
in the U.S. Supreme Court, which returned the case to the state
justices without comment.
   The U.S. Supreme Court has left the law unenforceable until the
Florida high court reviews it.

<TEXT>
   Orders to factories for manufactured goods
tumbled 2.7 percent in May, the steepest drop in 10 months, the
government reported Friday, providing more evidence of a weakening
economy caused by high interest rates.
   ``The big decline indicates the economy is slowing more sharply
than expected and underlines the Federal Reserve must actively move
to lower interest rates,'' said Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist
for the National Association of Manufacturers.
   ``We're at a point now, where the slowdown may get away from us
if the Fed doesn't respond soon,'' Jasinowski said.
   The Commerce Department reported the decline in orders for both
durable and non-durable goods to a seasonally adjusted $234 billion
in May was the steepest falloff since orders dropped 3.6 percent in
July 1988.
   Until recently, interest rates had been rising as a result of the
Fed's efforts to restrain inflation by tightening credit. The May
downturn in factory orders reflected other reports recently of a
slowing economy.
   Most analysts believe that the Fed is steering the economy to a
so-called soft landing, rather than a recession, and there already
have been signs it is easing its grip on credit.
   ``I don't think that we're heading for anything like a
recession,'' said Robert Brusca, chief financial economist for Nikko
Securities Co. International Inc. in New York. ``I think we may have
something like that coming our way by the end of next year, but not
for the moment.''
   Taking exception to the soft-landing theory was Bruce Steinberg
of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New York who said ``the one area
of real strength has been the industrial sector and that's really
softening up.
   ``I think there will be a recession the second half of the
year,'' he said.
   Orders for durable goods, big-ticket items expected to last more
than three years, represented virtually all of the May decline. They
were off 4.5 percent to $123.6 billion, even worse than a
preliminary report last week that they had fallen 4.2 percent.
   Pierre Ellis, senior economist for the Boston Co. in New York,
explained that interest rates are a big factor in durable goods
purchasing decisions.
   Ellis and other analysts said the slowdown could lead to more
unemployment if manufacturers cut back production in the face of
declining demand.
   Transportation equipment fell 9.6 percent largely because of a
big drop in commerical aircraft orders to lead May's decline.
Without the volatile transportation sector, durable goods orders
would have been off only 1.2 percent.
   Other drops in the durable area included primary metals, off 1.3
percent; non-electrical machinery, off 3.3 percent; and electrical
machinery, off 5.8 percent.
   Non-durable orders fell 0.1 percent to $110.4 billion.
   Ellis said these orders ``have seen substantial inflation during
the last several months,'' and the decline ``may reflect an
unwillingness of purchasers to pay higher prices.''
   May's overall decline in orders followed increases of 3 percent
in April and 0.7 percent in March. Orders had fallen the first two
months of the year.
   Shipments of manufactured goods fell 0.2 percent in May to a
seasonally adjusted $233.5 billion, after a 2.6 percent increase in
April.

<TEXT>
   An activist minister who advised Tawana
Brawley, a black girl who lied about being raped by a gang of white
men, pleaded innocent Friday to tax evasion charges.
   The Rev. Al Sharpton entered his plea a day after he was accused
in a separate case of stealing $250,000 from his youth organization.
``It ain't over 'til the fat guy sings,'' the plump Sharpton said
after posting $20,000 bail.
   Sharpton, 34, who advised Miss Brawley throughout her yearlong
ruse, was charged with filing a false instrument, filing a false
income tax return for 1987 and for failing to file an income tax
return for 1986.
   The indictment brought about by Attorney General Robert Abrams
carries penalties of up to 5 years in jail and $60,000 in fines.
   In New York City on Thursday, Sharpton was arrested on a 67-count
indictment for charges including fraud and grand larceny. Abrams
said Sharpton made personal use of money solicited for the National
Youth Movement, which he started as an anti-drug group when he was
16.
   No date has been set for the trials that will be held in Albany
and New York City.
   Sharpton, who is black, said ``black people ought to file and
then go to civil court and say we don't owe this country anything.
And that's what I intend to do.''
   Income tax owed by blacks should be ``deducted from the
reparations America owes us,'' he said.
   Authorities said Sharpton owed $26,000 in state income taxes in
1986 when he allegedly failed to file any return and that he evaded
$9,000 in state income taxes in 1987, the first year he ever filed a
state tax return.
   The state alleges Sharpton evaded state income taxes by using the
bank accounts of the National Youth Movement as his personal
accounts.
   Sharpton said he used the organization's funds to pay for such
activities as anti-drug programs and for the buses that transported
people to demonstrations such as the one held in Albany last year in
support of Miss Brawley.
   Miss Brawley claimed she was abducted and raped by white men. She
was found Nov. 28, 1987, in a plastic garbage bag, smeared with
feces and with racial epithets scrawled on her body.
   Sharpton acted as a Brawley family adviser and Abrams headed the
investigation into the girl's allegations. After a seven-month
investigation a grand jury last year concluded Miss Brawley made the
story up.

<TEXT>
   Flazey, the 35-pound grouper who
made headlines by eating $5,000 worth of exotic fish put into his
tank, is being sent back home to the sea.
   Terry Haley of Lansing, Ill., anesthesized his fish last week and
shipped him back to Noyes Marine Life, the Fort Lauderdale aquarium
supplier he bought him from.
   ``He hasn't been fed for a week to 10 days,'' said Noyes' owner
Bob Stewart. ``He's probably ready for some fish.''
   Flazey _ named by school kids who combined ``fat'' with ``lazy''
_ attracted nationwide attention in May when he ate his way through
$5,000 worth of expensive tropical fish.
   ``He was convinced he could get a 2-foot nurse shark down his
throat. He worked hard at it every day,'' said Stewart. ``Most
mornings began with Terry trying to pry it out of his mouth with a
broom handle.''
   Flazey was put in a 500-gallon tank in the Noyes warehouse where
he will wait to be set free off the South Florida coast, most likely
on Monday, Stewart said.
   Flazey will have no trouble getting back into his old routine,
Stewart said.
   ``This isn't like a lion cub raised in captivity that you can't
return to the wild,'' he said. ``When he goes back he'll be a terror
on the reef and quite a surprise to its inhabitants.''
   Flazey has grown less shy of humans than he should be, Stewart
said, so he will be released in deep waters.
   Haley brought Flazey from Noyes Marine Life 18 months ago. After
eating its way through the fish in Haley's 1,100-gallon tank,
12-inch Flazey grew into a 35-pound, 3{-foot tank terror.
   ``He was just doing what he was created to do,'' said Stewart.
``He was hunting in that tank and trying to fill his belly at every
opportunity.''
   Flazey was fed five pounds of smelt every other day in addition
to his ``supplementary'' diet of costly tropical fish.

   President Fidel Castro ordered Maj. Gen.
Arnaldo Ochoa dishonorably discharged from the Cuban armed forces
Friday after a military court ordered the officer tried on drug
trafficking and other charges.
   Cuba's news agency Prensa Latina, monitored in the Mexican
capital, said Castro signed the order, which also strips Ochoa of
all rank, decorations and titles. It cals for a court-martial to try
Ochoa and 15 other ranking officers on charges of high treason.
   The trial was set to begin Friday night.
   A military tribunal on Monday also ordered the court-martial of
Ochoa, 57, for his alleged organization of a ring that smuggled
cocaine from Colombia to the United States. He also is accused of
smuggling ivory and diamonds.
   The tribunal recommended that Ochoa be executed by a firing squad
if found guilty.
   A three-man court-martial headed by Division Gen. Ramon Espinosa
will determine whether Ochoa and the other 15 officers committed
``serious crimes against the nation and violations and transgression
of the constitutional laws,'' Prensa Latina earlier quoted Cuban
television as saying.
   Ochoa, who commanded forces in Angola and fought in Ethiopia, and
other military officers were arrested earlier this month in
connection with a crackdown on use of the island as a transit point
for narcotics shipments.
   Others to be tried are Brig. Gen. Patricio de la Guardia and his
twin borther Antonio, both of the Interior Ministry, which handles
law enforcement. The others are two aides to Ochoa and 11 other
interior officials, the agency said in the earlier dispatch.
   It did not mention Diocles Torralbas, a former transportation
minister, who was arrested earlier and was expelled with Ochoa from
the Communist Party on Thursday.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack
Kemp made a ``multimillion dollar commitment'' Friday to help
resolve a longstanding housing desegregation case in Yonkers, N.Y.
   Kemp would not specify the amount of federal funds involved but
HUD spokesman Jack Flynn stressed, ``The secretary has clearly made
a multimillion dollar commitment.''
   Kemp's actions include approval of construction, on five sites,
of 142 new units of public housing in Yonkers. He said the units are
an integral part of a federal court's plan in the Yonkers litigation
to provide low-income and moderate-income housing, open to all
races, in predominantly white sections of the city.
   ``President Bush and I are committed to fair housing and have
made the full enforcement of laws against discrimination one of our
top priorities'' for the agency, said Kemp in a statement. ``Our
actions will help provide low-income housing opportunities for those
in need and promote our goal of fair housing for all.''
   Yonkers Mayor Nicholas Wasicsko explained that HUD originally
promised $12 million for the project but the amount fell short of
the estimated $100,000 cost per unit, which is 20 percent higher
than planned.
   HUD now has agreed to pay the difference, which Wasicsko
estimated at an additional $3 million to $6 million.
   Wasicsko said groundbreaking for the 142 town houses is set for
March 1990. He said the city is to pay the $8.3 million for the
building sites, as well as at least $20 million for new schools
linked to the housing.
   A total of about 200 housing units are planned, he said.
   The Yonkers mayor said he had requested the money for the past
year in letters to HUD.
   ``I'm hoping it will have a psychological effect to see that even
Washington is going to go the extra mile. It's about time Yonkers
helped itself,'' said Wasicsko.
   ``Some councilmen will be shocked and some will be pleased. I
think it shows that for the first time someone outside of Yonkers is
lending a hand to make the remedy work.''
   U.S. District Judge Leonard B. Sand in 1985 found Yonkers liable
for 40 years of intentional segregation in its public housing and
schools. As part of his remedy, he ordered public housing be built
in predominantly white neighborhoods.
   The desegregation plan, however, has met with vehement opposition
in Yonkers, which flirted with bankruptcy last year when council
members refused to endorse part of the plan and Sand found them in
contempt of court and imposed escalating fines.
   Kemp praised the efforts of Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y., in
pursuing the settlement: ``Sen. Moynihan has long been a champion of
equal opportunity for all people, and his tenacity has been a key
element in reaching this ground-breaking resolution.''

   The nation's corn inventory as of June 1 was
3.42 billion bushels, down 41 percent from a year ago, the
Agriculture Department said Friday.
   Last year's drought cut grain harvests sharply, reducing supplies
and forcing up market prices. The June 1 inventory reflected those
reduced supplies.
   Of the total 3.42 billion bushels, 2.02 billion were stored on
farms, with off-farm storage accounting for the remainder, the
report said.
   The disappearance or use of corn during the three months ending
on June 1 was reported at 1.78 billion bushels, a 1 percent decline
from what it was in the comparable period a year earlier.
   Supplies of old-crop wheat on June 1 totaled 694 million bushels,
down 45 percent from a year earlier, the lowest for the date since
1976. The new wheat marketing year began on June 1.
   Farm stocks of wheat totaled 283 million bushels, while off-farm
supplies were 411 million bushels. Disappearance during the quarter
was reported at 528 million bushels, down 20 percent from a year
earlier.
   The June 1 soybean stockpile, at 465 million bushels, was down 29
percent from a year earlier, the lowest for the date since 1977.
Farm stocks were reported at 229 million bushels, and off-farm
supplies at 236 million.
   Soybean disappearance was shown at 425 million bushels during the
quarter, down 13 percent from a year earlier.

   An appeals court refused Friday to block the
extradition of Indian activist Eddie Hatcher, who was sent back to
North Carolina to face kidnapping charges in the takeover of a
newsroom last year.
   California's 1st District Court of Appeal denied Hatcher's
request less than two hours before a 5 p.m. extradition deadline set
by Municipal Court Judge J. Dominique Olcomendy.
   Hatcher, who has said his life would be in danger if he is
returned to North Carolina, is charged with kidnapping 14 people in
the 10-hour, Feb. 1, 1988, takeover of the The Robesonian
newspaper's newsroom in Lumberton, N.C.
   ``I feel that this judge, he's sending my son back without caring
whether he's killed or whether he gets a fair trial,'' said
Hatcher's mother, Thelma Clark, of Pembroke, N.C.
   In the newspaper takeover, Hatcher, 31, and fellow Tuscarora
tribesman Timothy Jacobs, said they were trying to draw attention to
local law enforcement's alleged involvement in drug dealing.
   Hatcher says that because of what he knows about the alleged drug
ring, his life is in danger if he must return.
   Hatcher and Jacobs both were tried and acquitted on federal
kidnapping charges. But the Robeson County grand jury last December
indicted the pair on state charges after the acquittals.
   Jacobs is in custody in North Carolina. Hatcher, who fled to
California, was arrested on March 10 after he sought asylum at the
Soviet consulate in San Francisco. Bail was set at $1 million.
   Hatcher appeared at his hearing Friday and stood between his
attorneys, John Phillipsborn and Charles Garry.
   During the 15-minute hearing, Phillipsborn pleaded with Olcomendy
to grant a stay of his extradition order to allow defense attorneys
``a reasonable amount of time to file an appeal.''
   Following arguments, Olcomendy gave defense attorneys until 5
p.m. to appeal.

   The 4-year-old girl who survived a
rampage that killed her mother and two sisters was the focus of a
courtroom battle Friday to decide who will raise her.
   Carmina Salcido's maternal grandfather is battling with the
family of her father, who is accused of the slayings, for custody of
the child.
   Sonoma County Superior Court Judge Arnold Rosenfield said he
won't make a final decision on custody until Oct. 27. A temporary
custody order placing Carmina with her mother's father, Bob
Richards, remains in effect.
   Both sides in the custody dispute were in court Friday, but
participants left without comment.
   Carmina's father, Ramon, a former Grand Cru Winery worker, is
charged with seven counts of murder stemming from an April 14
killing spree. The dead included Salcido's wife and two other
daughters, his wife's mother and two younger sisters and a co-worker
at Grand Cru.
   Carmina and her two sisters had their throats slashed and were
left at a Sonoma County garbage dump. Only Carmina survived.
   Salcido, 28, disappeared after the slayings and was arrested in
Mexico on April 19 and returned to Sonoma County the next day. He
has pleaded innocent to the charges against him and faces a
preliminary hearing this fall.

   A former federal security chief on trial for
the slaying of a prominent journalist will also be accused of
ordering the assassination of a special government agent, officials
said Friday.
   Special prosecutor Miguel Angel Garcia Dominguez told a news
conference he will file additional charges against Jose Antonio
Zorrilla Perez, director of the now-dissolved Federal Security
Administration, for the killing of special agent Jose Luis Esqueda
Gutierrez.
   Zorrilla is currently on trial for the May 30, 1984 slaying of
Manuel Buendia, whose books and front-page column in the newspaper
Excelsior exposed wrongdoing in high places.
   Garcia said he has ``voluminous evidence'' Zorrilla ordered
Buendia and Esqueda killed because they were investigating
Zorrilla's alleged links to leading drug traffickers.
   The gunmen in both slayings were members of the security
administration, whose functions were roughly similar to the FBI
until the organization was disbanded by the government in 1986 for
widespread corruption.
   Buendia was shot dead at the entrance of a parking garage near
his office. Garcia said the evidence shows the triggerman was Juan
Rafael Moro Avila, a playboy from a prominent family of Mexican
politicians.
   Moro, now awaiting trial, denied at his indictment that he fired
the shots that killed Buendia, claiming that a police informer who
was shot dead two years ago did it.
   Three other senior officers from the security administration,
including one woman, also are on trial for complicity in the Buendia
slaying.
   Esqueda, an Interior Department special agent assigned to
investigate Zorrilla's involvement with the drug trade, was killed
on Feb. 16, 1985 on a Mexico City street with a single shot to the
back of the neck, Garcia said.
   Alberto Estrella Barrera and two other security administration
officers carried out Esqueda's murder, Garcia said. He did not
identify the other two but said they are being sought by police.
   Estrella was arrested and, under questioning, claimed Zorrilla
ordered Esqueda killed. He is scheduled to be arraigned on a murder
charge before the city's 34th court sometime Saturday.
   Zorrilla was also charged with obstruction of justice, abuse of
authority, illicit enrichment and two other federal felonies _ drug
trafficking and illegal possesion of firearms reserved only for
military use.
   Garcia said 15 automatic rifles and pistols of unauthorized
caliber were seized at a hideout where Zorrilla was arrested.
   Both Esqueda and Buendia were longtime friends of Zorrilla. ``The
motive for killing them was the knowledge both victims had of
Zorrilla's links with the drug traffic,'' Garcia said.

   A judge said Friday he was convinced U.S.
Rep. Donald Lukens is a sex offender and sentenced him to 30 days in
jail and a $500 fine for having sex with a 16-year-old girl last
year.
   ``This court is particularly struck by the unwillingness of the
defendant to recognize that he was not the victim,'' Franklin County
Domestic Relations Judge Ronald Solove said, adding that he could
not excuse Lukens' contention that he was ``somehow seduced by a
child.''
   ``You have refused to take that degree of responsibility,''
Solove said. ``This court is convinced you are a sex offender.''
   Lukens' face appeared ashen as Solove sentenced him to the
maximum penalty on the misdemeanor charge of contributing to the
unruliness of a child _ 180 days in jail and a $1,000 fine. The
judge then suspended all but 30 days of the sentence and $500 of the
fine and placed Lukens on probation for one year.
   The terms of probation require Lukens to participate in sex
offender programs and submit to testing for sexually transmitted
diseases.
   A jury May 26 convicted the Middletown Republican following a
five-day trial. Lukens, 58, who is divorced, allegedly paid Rosie
Coffman of Columbus $40 to have sex with him at his Columbus
apartment on Nov. 6.
   Lukens left the courtroom without commenting to reporters. In a
telephone interview from Washington, Lukens' spokesman, Bill
Jarrell, said it was a mistake for the judge to claim Lukens was not
apologetic because ``it's absurd for someone to expect to show
remorse for something they're innocent of.''
   Lukens went free after his lawyers posted $10,000 bond, pending
appeal.
   Ms. Coffman, now 17, said she believed the sentence was fair.
   ``I really hope he does go through the counseling because he
really needs it. He is sick and he really needs help. Just because
he's sick with the problem, he made a lot of others sick with the
problem. I am going to counseling too,'' she said.
   Her mother, Anna Coffman, was in the courtroom and showed no
expression as the sentence was read.
   Allegations that Lukens had sex with Ms. Coffman surfaced in
February when Columbus television station WSYX broadcast a tape of a
Nov. 11 meeting between Lukens and Anna Coffman.
   Lukens did not know the meeting at a local fast-food restaurant
was being taped. On the tape, Lukens offered to find Mrs. Coffman a
government job after she accused him of ``messing around'' with her
daughter on Nov. 6 and four years earlier, when the girl was 13.
   Conviction on a misdemeanor does not automatically bar Lukens
from Congress. But Ohio Republican Party Chairman Robert Bennett on
June 1 called for Lukens to resign from Congress and the Ohio
Republican State Committee. Bennett vowed that Lukens would not
appear on the party ballot in 1990.
   In addition, the House Ethics Committee has been asked to
investigate the case. The ethics committee complaint was filed by
House Republican leader Bob Michel, R-Ill.
   Lukens served two terms in Congress from 1967 to 1970, when he
made an unsuccessful attempt to gain the GOP gubernatorial
nomination in Ohio. After 15 years in the Ohio Senate, he was
returned to Congress by voters in the western Ohio district in 1986.

   An 8,200-acre fire was dying Friday
after burning four days and destroying 11 homes and cabins in dry,
windswept hills and canyons covered with brush.
   The Lake Elsinore blaze in Riverside County was reported close to
90 percent containment, and fire crews expected to have it
surrounded by Saturday night, said California Department of Forestry
spokeswoman Joanne Evans.
   ``It's been slow going today because the firefighters are working
in a wilderness area now and they aren't allowed to use the power
saws and other heavy equipment they could use in non-wilderness
areas,'' Evans said.
   ``They are handling it with kidgloves; trying not to damage what
wilderness areas we have left,'' she said.
   The fire 65 miles southeast of Los Angeles was the largest and
most destructive of three major wildfires in drought-stricken
Southern California, said Forestry spokesman Jim Reeder.
   A 2,250-acre blaze in the Antelope Valley 45 miles northwest of
Los Angeles was declared contained Thursday after destroying one
home and briefly forcing 2,500 people to evacuate.
   A short but fierce 100-acre fire in Claremont, 35 miles east of
Los Angeles, threatened homes near Sycamore Canyon Park with flying
embers before it was snuffed Thursday night.
   Inspectors were still hunting Frida for witnesses to the starting
of the Lake Elsinore blaze, Reeder said. The investigation will
determine whether the fire was arson or accidental.
   Reeder said 2,292 people fought the Elsinore blaze at its height.
No damage estimate had been made for the fire.

   Divers battling stormy seas Friday found
the body of one of three crewmen trapped inside a capsized
oil-drilling vessel in the Gulf of Mexico, and had little hope of
finding survivors, the Coast Guard said.
   The body of an unidentified crewman was found inside the vessel's
galley and was taken to Galveston aboard the Coast Guard cutter
Point Spencer, Petty Officer John Royal said.
   The divers conducted a second search but found nothing, said
Coast Guard Lt. Scott LaRochelle. ``They concluded that no more
bodies are in the vessel,'' he said.
   LaRochelle said a Coast Guard helicopter and patrol boat were
searching about nine miles from the capsized vessel for the missing
crewmen. Other workers were rescued in the same vicinity Thursday
night, he said.
   Officials called off their search for a fourth man who fell
overboard from a fishing vessel that reported the accident,
LaRochelle said. The man, whose name was not released, was said to
be a non-swimmer who was not wearing a life jacket.
   Six workers from the 100-foot-long oil-drilling vessel Titan were
rescued late Thursday by Coast Guard helicopter and boat crews about
2{ hours after the accident. The men suffered only minor injuries,
Merwin said.
   Divers hired by rig operator Delta Lift Barges Inc. of Galliano,
La., were delayed in their efforts to enter the overturned vessel
Friday morning by thunderstorms and choppy seas, but eventually
secured a safety line and began their search.
   The fishing vessel Captain Gabriel reported the capsized rig at
about 7:15 p.m. Thursday in 90 feet of water about 26 miles south of
Freeport, Merwin said.
   He said officials did not know what caused the collapse, but the
vessel remained bottom-up in the water Friday. Waves were reportedly
about 6 feet high at the time of the accident.
   One of the rescued crewman, identified as Trent Chauvin, was
treated for a broken ankle and released from Brazosport Memorial
Hospital, spokeswoman Lynette Ennis said.
   Two others, Monroe Alvarez, 25, and Troy Hebert, 22, were treated
for exposure Thursday night and released from John Sealy Hospital in
Galveston, hospital spokesman Robert Nichols said.
   The names of the other survivors and those missing were not
immediately available.

   Zsa Zsa Gabor was charged Friday
with three misdemeanors, including battery, for allegedly slapping a
policeman who stopped her Rolls-Royce for having expired license
tags.
   Two other misdemeanors accuse her of disobeying a peace office
and having an expired driver's license, said Los Angeles County
Deputy District Attorney Eldon S. Fox.
   There were also two infractions, which are violations of the
Motor Vehicle Code, alleging that she had an open container of
alcohol in a vehicle and had an expired registration when stopped
June 14.
   The charges carry various sentences upon conviction ranging from
a $100 fine for the violations of the Motor Vehicle Code to a $2,000
fine and a year in jail on the battery charge.
   The actress was arrested June 14 after a motorcycle officer
stopped her $215,000 Rolls-Royce Corniche for having an expired
license. Police said when Miss Gabor handed the officer her drivers
license, it too was expired.
   When the officer returned to his motorcycle to use his radio, Ms.
Gabor drove away, police said, and the officer had to chase her with
red lights and siren blaring to stop her again.
   He ordered her out of her car, police said, and she got out and
slapped the officer in the face. The actress maintains she was
roughed up during the arrest and has threatened to sue the Beverly
Hills Police Department.
   She is scheduled to appear in Beverly Hills Municipal Court on
July 12.

   Gunmen killed a prominent
advocate of the far right Friday in the second such assassination of
a politician this month.
   Witnesses said Edgar Chacon's car was raked with submachine-gun
fire from a passing pickup truck at midafternoon as he was driving
in the Miramonte neighborhood in the northwest area of the capital.
   Patricia Gonzalez, a spokeswoman for Hospital Diagnostico, said
Chacon, 42, died in the emergency room.
   No group claimed responsibility, but President Alfredo Cristiani
blamed the leftist guerrillas of the Farbundo Marti National
Liberation Front, also known as the FMLN.
   Cristiani called it a ``cowardly act by sick minds.'' He said
that Chacon ``used only ideas and his beliefs as arms. He expressed
what he thought was good and bad, and this demonstrates the
inability of the FMLN to promote their cause with ideas instead of
violence.''
   Cristiani spoke with reporters after a ceremony at the Supreme
Court.
   Chacon was director of the Institute for International Relations,
a far-right think tank. A vehement anti-communist, he abandoned the
rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance, also known as Arena,
several years ago.
   Chacon accused the party, in power since June 1, of going soft in
its opposition to communism. In forums and frequent appearances on
locally broadcast programs he accused Cuba and Nicaragua of
supporting El Salvador's leftist guerrillas in their 9-year-old
fight for power.
   He was a sponsor in May of the Patriotic Civil Defense Force of
right-wing volunteers in the affluent San Salvador neighborhood of
Escalon.
   Christian Democratic President Jose Napoleon Duarte dissolved the
short-lived force shortly before handing power to Arena leader
Cristiani.
   A lone gunman on June 9 assassinated Antonio Rodriguez Porth,
Cristiani's most senior Cabinet member. Rodriguez held the title of
minister to the presidency and was another prominent rightist
political analyst.
   The government and armed forces also blamed Rodriguez's death on
the FMLN, but the insurgent army denied killing Rodriguez.
   The guerrillas claimed responsibility for the assassination
Monday of Col. Roberto Rivera. He, too, was shot and killed while
driving his car on a San Salvador street.

   A teen-ager who killed her abusive father
was acquitted Friday in a judgment that extends to juveniles the
post-traumatic stress defense previously used in cases of battered
wives killing husbands.
   Circuit Judge John Kuder found Diana Goodykoontz, 15, innocent of
second-degree murder in the July 23 slaying of Navy Chief Petty
Officer Dennis Goodykoontz at the family's home in this Panhandle
city.
   He was shot to death with his own .357-caliber Magnum revolver.
   Witnesses testified during the four-day, non-jury trial that the
girl suffered from battered child syndrome, a form of the
post-traumatic stress disorder that afflicts some battle-shocked
veterans.
   The judge said it caused her to have the reasonable belief she
was in ``imminent danger of great bodily harm'' although her father
had taken no overt physical action just before he was shot.
   ``And (she) further reasonably believed that the use of deadly
force was necessary to prevent that harm from occurring,'' the judge
said.
   Prosecutors argued that Ms. Goodykoontz acted under the influence
of heavy-metal rock that dwells on the occult and suicide, but Kuder
said evidence failed to show any connection between the music and
the slaying.
   ``I thought that they were just going to do something to me,
anyway, 'cause ... I like the music,'' Ms. Goodykoontz said
afterward. ``It's not fair to judge somebody just because of what
they listen to.''
   Ms. Goodykoontz had testified that her father made sexual
overtures and she was afraid he was going to rape her. The judge
also heard testimony that the father had a history of violence
against his wife and three children that was tied to drinking, had
virtually held them hostage at their home, had once threatened to
kill the entire family and himself.
   Goodykoontz had gotten drunk just before Ms. Goodykoontz shot him
and ordered the family to the living room. She testified she
believed another violent confrontation was imminent and she refused,
instead retreating to her parents' bedroom, where the gun was kept.
   ``Diana's testimony indicates she considered escape through the
bedroom window but believed that the curtains and other obstacles
would prevent it,'' Kuder said. ``She stepped from the room into the
hall and fired one shot into the chest of her father.''
   Ms. Goodykoontz, who was tried in juvenile court, could have been
placed in juvenile detention until age 19, had she been convicted.
In an adult court, she would have faced up to life in prison.

   A ship loaded with tons of a mustard
gas chemical component made by a West German company and sent to
Iran is en route to Dubai and will be stopped there, West German
television reported Friday.
   The ZDF network, quoting unidentified government sources in Bonn,
said the ship sailed from Bombay, India, and was expected to arrive
Saturday in Dubai, one of the United Arab Emirates on the Persian
Gulf.
   Government officials said earlier Friday that they had
information that the shipment had left Bombay, but gave no further
details.
   The shipment is at the center of a chemical weapons scandal in
West Germany. Prosecutors said Thursday said they had opened a
criminal investigation of Rheineisen Chemical Products of
Duesseldorf, which contracted to deliver to Iran more than 250 tons
of thionyl chloride. The chemical can be used to make mustard gas.
   Company officials deny any wrongdoing and have said they had
government approval for the shipment. The company said this week it
would cooperate in stopping the shipment.
   In another development, The New York Times on Saturday quoted an
Indian official as saying the Indian government's State Trading
Corp. sold Iran 60 tons of thionyl chloride in March. The official
said the sale did not represent a breach of local laws because the
chemical is a freely traded commodity often used in pesticides.
   The Iranian Foreign Ministry said Friday it never planned to
purchase chemicals from a West German company to produce poison gas.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia,
quoted an unidentified ministry spokesman as saying the allegations
were ``false, biased and followed particular political propaganda
goals.''
   The spokesman ``categorically denied reports on Iran's intention
to purchase chemical materials for manufacture of chemical weapons''
and accused U.S. and European media of making up the story.
   The news agency also quoted the spokesman as denying the Iranians
had summoned a diplomat in the case.
   The West German Foreign Ministry said it had asked Iran to recall
the diplomat after receiving information from Washington that he
allegedly was involved in the deal. But the diplomat left before a
formal request was made.
   The Iranian spokesman said the diplomat's tour of duty had ended
more than a month ago and that he had returned to Tehran, according
to IRNA.
   Sources in Bonn, Germany, identified the man as Seyed Karim Ali
Sobhani and said he had worked for the Iranian Embassy there since
September 1987.
   The Rheineisen revelations followed an international uproar six
months ago over the involvement of West German companies in the
building of a suspected poison gas factory in Libya.

   A dying soldier of fortune accused Hustler
magazine publisher Larry Flynt and Flynt's former chief of security
of murdering him, a ``Cotton Club'' murder case witness testified
Thursday.
   Michael Pascal said he visited Mitchell WerBell on his deathbed
in 1983 and was told, ``They put something in the drink.''
   Pascal said WerBell was asked, ``Who got you?''
   ``He indicated Rider and Flynt,'' said the witness.
   William Rider, the former chief of security, testified last week
against two former Flynt bodyguards charged with the 1983 murder of
New York theatrical producer Roy Radin. Rider, Flynt's
brother-in-law, testified that he never participated in any killings
but the defendants did.
   Pascal's statements came during cross-examination by defense
attorneys who are challenging the credibility of Rider, a key
prosecution witness in the case. Pascal was testifying at a
preliminary hearing for three of the four people charged with
Radin's murder.
   Municipal Judge Patti Jo McKay, however, ultimately ordered most
of Pascal's testimony stricken after ruling that what WerBell said
did not qualify as a dying statement because he didn't know he was
dying. Such a statement would be an exception to the rules barring
hearsay evidence.
   ``Not only are the statements inherently incredible, but on their
face they make no sense,'' Carl Grumer, one of Flynt's attorneys,
commented after the hearing.
   He said WerBell's death certificate lists heart disease and
congestive heart failure as the causes of death.
   Pascal's prosecution testimony during the preliminary hearing for
three of the four people charged with Radin's murder has been more
favorable to the defense.
   The fourth defendant charged in the case, Robert Ulmer Lowe, was
arraigned Thursday after waiving extradition from Maryland. Lowe
pleaded innocent to the murders of Radin and a prostitute, June
Mincher, and denied special circumstances which could bring him the
death penalty if convicted.
   Lowe's attorney, Mark Kaiserman, asked that the defendant be kept
in a high security section of the jail saying he had been receiving
threats.
   Pascal, who runs a security service that provided some of the
Flynt bodyguards, also testified that Rider at different times
admitted two murders, solicited a third and discussed a plan to blow
up the U.S. Capitol.
   Rider's testimony has linked the defendants to Radin's death and
implicated movie producer Robert Evans and reputed drug dealer Karen
DeLayne ``Lanie'' Greenberger.
   Radin, 33, was negotiating financing of the movie ``The Cotton
Club'' with Evans when he disappeared on May 13, 1983, after
stepping into a limousine with Mrs. Greenberger. His bullet-riddled
body was found a month later in a dry riverbed 65 miles north of Los
Angeles.
   The preliminary hearing will determine whether Mrs. Greenberger,
Lowe, William Mentzer and Alex Marti stand trial. Evans has refused
to testify, but his lawyer has said he was not involved.
   Pascal said Rider told him WerBell was poisoned with a drug-laced
drink because he refused to train Flynt's people at a paramilitary
camp WerBell operated in Georgia.
   WerBell, a soldier of fortune and firearms dealer, died in Los
Angeles in December 1983. His family said he suffered a heart attack.
   But Pascal said he and a New Orleans investigator, Gordon Novell,
visited WerBell in the hospital after the 65-year-old WerBell
collapsed at a cocktail party at Flynt's house.
   Deputy District Attorney David Conn asked if WerBell said
anything else during the visit.
   ``He named Mr. Rider and Mr. Flynt,'' said Pascal. ``He asked us
to get them, Flynt and Rider. He was talking to Gordon Novell,
holding his hand and he said: `For me, get them.'''
   Pascal also claimed that Rider said he killed someone in the
men's room of the Hustler Bar in Columbus, Ohio, but he did not name
the victim. And he said Rider solicited him to kill an FBI informant
by throwing the man out of a 16th floor hotel room window in

   A sheriff's deputy who shot and killed a
farmer in May did not commit a felony, a six-member coroner's jury
ruled Thursday.
   The jury deliberated about an hour and a half before finding that
Donnell Sullivan, 53, died of ``violent means of a non-felonious
nature.''
   Cooper County Prosecutor Douglas Abele said he would announce
Friday if criminal proceedings would be a pursued against county
Deputy Paul Milne in connection with Sullivan's death on May 26.
   A coroner's jury findings cannot be used in a criminal trial, but
testimony from the hearing can be used in a trial.
   The victim's family was not available for comment after the
verdict was read.
   Milne and another deputy, Emil Kramil, had gone to Sullivan's
Boonville farm to serve a warrant to commit him to a mental hospital
in Columbia for evaluation.
   When the deputy told Sullivan why he was there, Sullivan refused
to go. Milne said he tried twice to grab Sullivan from the pickup
truck he was sitting in but Sullivan resisted.
   Sullivan threw Kramil to the ground and ran to the other side of
the truck and eventually took a hatchet from the vehicle, Milne
testified.
   Milne ordered Sullivan to drop the hatchet but he refused. The
deputy said he drew his gun, advanced three steps and fired from
about five feet away.
   He said he believed Sullivan posed a clear and present danger to
him.
   ``You don't turn your back on a man with a weapon,'' Milne said.
   The victim's mother, Tuesdanna Sullivan, had asked for a federal
investigation of the shooting, a request supported by the regional
chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People. The Sullivans are black, and Milne and Kramil are white.
   A Missouri State Highway Patrol investigation found no evidence
of wrongdoing. The FBI also investigated the shooting and said it
would not reopen it unless there was new evidence or unless it was
ordered to do so by the Justice Department.

   The Department of Housing and Urban Development
is canceling a $500 million mortgage loan guarantee program that one
official says is an ``absolute disaster.''
   HUD Secretary Jack Kemp ordered the troubled program canceled
Thursday, as the department said the program was ``riddled with
abuse.''
   Meanwhile, a House Government Operations subcommittee today was
beginning review of another HUD program _ the mortgage coinsurance
program _ in which a recent inspector general's audit found lenders
had underwritten $700 million in loans that defaulted by mid-1988.
   On Thursday, the subcommittee produced a government memo that
links a staffer in George Bush's vice presidential office to a
project involved in alleged influence-peddling at HUD.

   Federal officials are investigating possible
credit card fraud against patrons of an alleged homosexual
prostitution ring, including a top political operative in the Labor
Department who has now resigned.
   The investigation is based on financial records and other
material seized in raids on a house in an upscale Washington
neighborhood that police say was used by escort services with names
such as ``Dream Boys'' and ``Man to Man.''
   U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens on Thursday confirmed the
investigation into allegedly fraudulent multiple billings of the
services' patrons, after The Washington Times reported that the ring
was patronized by Reagan and Bush administration officials,
congressional aides and one of its own former editors.
   One of a handful of individuals named in the Times article, Paul
R. Balach, resigned Thursday evening.
   ``I hereby resign my position this date due to the public
disclosure of activities concerning my personal life,'' Balach said
in a letter announcing his resignation as Labor Secretary Elizabeth
Dole's political personnel liaison to the White House.

   Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski says he's open to
additional democratic reforms in Communist Poland as long as they
benefit society.
   The comments by the Polish leader came before the party's Central
Committee meets today to consider a nominee, likely Jaruzelski, for
the new office of president.
   Jaruzelski in a 40-minute interview with The Associated Press
said the party will not return to its monopoly rule of the past.
``We have become convinced that monopoly is a very unhealthy thing,
not only in the economy, but also in political life.''
   Candidates backed by the labor union Solidarity won 99 of 100
seats in the newly created Senate and all 161 seats open to the
opposition in the 460-member Sejm during voting in June. The
remaining Sejm seats were reserved for the governing communists and
their allies, who they control the legislature.

   A $600 million loan by American and other
western banks to communist East Germany in 1985 wound up in Libya,
and part of it was used by terrorists against Americans, says a
former staffer for the National Security Council.
   About $60 million of the money was divided evenly among the Red
Brigades in Germany, the provisional Irish Republican Army in
Northern Ireland and the M-19 guerrilla force in Colombia, said
Norman A. Bailey, senior director of national security planning from
1981 to 1983.
   The loan was arranged by the First National Bank of Chicago along
with the International Bank of Japan, according to Tom Lindeman, a
spokesman for the Chicago bank. He added that about 50 banks of
several nationalities took part and the agent was the Arab Banking
Corp. of Bahrain.
   Such loans have been criticized by some prominent Americans,
including former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger.

   China renewed attacks today on foreign countries
it said were trying to isolate it for suppressing the pro-democracy
movement, and complained of an ``anti-China'' bias.
   State media in morning reports said Premier Li Peng dismissed
international criticism of the crackdown, which began June 3-4 when
the army pushed into Beijing's Tiananmen Square and fired on
protesters. At least 200 people were killed.
   ``China has also noticed an anti-China ... current,'' Li told the
foreign minister of Sao Tome and Principe, an island nation off West
Africa. ``Under the banner of human rights, these people have made
unwarranted accusations of China for its quelling of the
counterrevolutionary rebellion and punishment of criminals according
to law.''
   President Yang Shangkun told a visiting delegation from Bolivia
on Thursday that he hoped the world ``will understand that the
suppression of the rebellion represents a reasonable act in handling
our internal affairs,'' the state-run China Daily reported.

   China's senior leader Deng Xiaoping on Friday
completed the purge of his one-time protege, Zhao Ziyang, who was
disgraced after expressing sympathy for the student-led movement for
democratic reforms.
   Zhao, ousted as Communist Party chief last weekend, was fired
Friday from his last government post, vice chairman of the Central
Military Commission.
   He was effectively stripped of power more than a month ago, after
he paid a tearful visit on May 19 to students on a hunger strike in
Tiananmen Square. He has not been seen in public since.
   Hundreds of thousands of students and their supporters flocked to
the square, the symbolic center of China, until the military crushed
the seven-week pro-democracy movement by firing on unarmed civilians
to drive protesters from the plaza on June 3-4.

rather than the boy's blood relatives.
   ``I have been co-parenting Collin,'' Susan Bellemare, 33, told a
Vermont probate judge as she fought to win custody of the
15-month-old. ``I would parent the child, I would love him, nurture
him.''
   Bellemare was named guardian of Collin Hamilton in the will of
Susan Hamilton, who died in a car accident in May. Hamilton's
parents are challenging the will, claiming they or Hamilton's
sister, Kathleen, would be a better guardian.
   No one involved in the case would characterize the relationship
of the two women, who owned a home together and reportedly exchanged
wedding rings. They were companions for a dozen years and lived
together while raising the baby, who was conceived by artificial
insemination.

   Welcome to Sillyville, where yellow
Spurtlegurgles, red Bittybooties, blue Twirlypops and green
Jingleheimers perform a gaggle of goofy kids' songs.
   It's latest in music videos from the creators of Wee Sing
songbooks, coloring books and cassettes.
   ``Pee-wee's Playhouse'' it's not. And that's just fine for Pam
Beall and Susan Nipp, who began their WeeSing venture 12 years ago
with an eye toward tradition.
   The two former music teachers have parlayed an initial $200
investment into a multimillion dollar kiddie publishing line based
on traditional music in the public domain.
   In 1977, Beall and Nipp were fumbling about for forgotten verses
to traditional tot songs. The two, then mothers to four toddlers,
started looking for songbooks.
   ``We found some very beautiful hardbound books, but they'd only
have a few of the songs we were looking for. And they were just too
expensive for young mothers,'' Beall said on the set of the pair's
fourth video production.
   Beall and Nipp, who had given up elementary music teaching in the
Portland suburbs of Lake Oswego and Beaverton to stay home with
their children, also were casting about for a cottage business.
   They began conducting workshops for parents and teachers,
researching the words to children's songs, and finally putting them
together in a book.
   The first run of their self-published songbook, ``WeeSing,'' was
a mere 500 copies selling for a modest $2.95. Within two years Wee
Publishing had sold 20,000 copies.
   Often working nights after their children were in bed, Beall and
Nipp were responsible for everything from making sales calls on
local bookstores to packaging, mailing and billing.
   ``After two years we decided it was too much,'' said Nipp. ``We
wanted to write more books and we just didn't have enough time.''
   So the women packed a suitcase full of their books, left the
children with their husbands and headed for an American Booksellers
Association convention in Seattle.
   Price Stern and Sloan, a Los Angeles-based publisher, took on the
``Wee Sing'' songbook, giving Beall and Nipp time to write and
design the next in what would become a series of nine songbooks.
   With one exception, each songbook features words and music to
about 30 children's favorites from ``Old MacDonald'' to ``Little
Bunny Froo Froo,'' hand-lettered by Beall and illustrated by Nancy
Klein. Also on each tape are one or two songs written by Beall and
Nipp.
   The books emphasize standard children's songs because the women
wish to keep tradition alive, especially during a time when so much
new children's music is being produced.
   ``They're (songs) that are tried and true, so we know they're
still good for kids,'' said Beall.
   At their publishers' urging, Beall, 42, and Nipp, 43, agreed to
market ``Wee Sing'' cassette tapes, now a standard feature with the
song and coloring books.
   ``We fought the cassette tapes for a long time because our
purpose was to get the parent or teacher to sing with the child.
Then we realized that some people couldn't carry a tune or just
wanted to listen so we consented to the tapes. And it's been good,''
Beall said.
   The tapes, first produced in Chicago using professional singers,
have since reverted to a homespun sound using the Beall and Nipp
children.
   ``We didn't want a real `Annie,' Hollywood sound,'' said Beall.
``The logical choice was to use our own kids.''
   Videos for each songbook came next.
   Their agreement with Price Stern Sloan keeps all production in
Portland, even though Nipp moved with her family to Coeur d'Alene,
Idaho, in 1979. But she and Beall maintain a close partnership
through daily phone calls and monthly visits.

<HEAD>A Tool for The Wise But Not for the Fools</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Debt is a wonderful tool _ in the hands of a wise
man but not a fool.
   It allows people to live well today off tomorrow's income. It
finances home ownership, cars, vacations, educations. It keeps
economic expansions running beyond their time. It permits
politicians grandiloquently to spread the wealth.
   It is creative. One of the amazing discoveries of recent years
has been that debt never needs to be repaid. If the borrower fails
to meet the terms the terms are eased and the due date extended.
With nations, it can go on forever.
   Nothing is resolved by pushing back the due dates, of course, but
it does buy time and it helps institutions save face. Many banks
have pushed the Third World debt problem right off the front pages
by this expedient.
   But every other day an irritating, nagging question arises from
deep in the interior of our being: Is the tool in the hands of wise
men, or is it being wielded by fools?
   Specifically, is it wise to run federal budget deficits when one
of the biggest items in the budget is to repay old debts, lend money
to nations that cannot repay, finance students who use their
education to evade collection?
   Every day another aspect of bad debt is presented for public
consideration.
   Savings and loan associations lent billions on frivolous projects
and now, to save the financial system, must be bailed out by
taxpayers. Some of the loans were fraudulent. Some were made in good
faith by fools.
   Home lenders eased their mortgage terms by such devices as not
verifying income, offering greatly reduced ``come-on'' rates for the
first year only, and agreeing to base the loan on two incomes while
observing that the wife was pregnant.
   Corporate raiders and merger artists learned that all it takes to
command a bank's billions is to make it an offer it cannot afford to
turn down, even when the bank knows the borrower is going to be
suffocated in high-cost debt.
   And the other side of the same picture: Companies threatened by
takeover have learned that the best defense is to buy off current
shareholders with a big dividend and then go deep into debt to scare
off the raider.
   And still another aspect of the same scene: Corporate lenders
devised junk bonds _ or high-risk, high-yield loans _ to finance
hundreds of companies, some of which barely have earnings to repay
the finance charges.
   In 1978, less than $2 billion of these bonds were out there. Now
there may be as much as $180 billion of them outstanding, most
issued in the past three or four years.
   They are expensive to the issuing company, which in many
instances is a company that has trouble making enough money to pay
the interest. But interest is just part of the problem; the
principal must be repaid too.
   In many instances the assumption is made that the company, often
a weak one, will be so nourished by the infusion of money that it
will build itself up like a football player, trample its competition
and earn big money.
   Risky? Of course. But junk bonds have a following, mainly because
of the great returns to the lender (the same return that may
threaten the survival of the borrower). At 12.6 percent, a bond
returns in interest its original cost.
   Those who buy them are said to be among the wisest and prudent
professional investors in the world. Mutual funds and insurance
companies each own about 30 percent of them, pensions funds 15
percent and savings and loans 8 percent.
   Wise men or fools? It's hard to say right now. The ultimate junk
bond scenario might not unfold until the late 1990s, when some
borrowers are due to be redeeming, or perhaps defaulting on, their
notes.
   But the question pervades the entire borrowing and lending scene
and, like the loans themselves, there seems to be great reluctance
in facing the realities.
   Home mortgage defaults are rising, for example, and the veterans
mortgage plan might be in trouble. Still, Congress is considering
legislation to permit eligible veterans to buy homes costing up to
$184,000 with no down payment.
   Wise or foolish? Is the tool being used to dig a hole that
undermines the economy? Wise men seem to shy from the question, and
by so doing reveal that they too might be buying time and hoping for
the best.

   Sixteen years ago, Bunny Wailer, Peter Tosh and
Robert Marley released ``Catch a Fire.'' The album catapulted the
reggae trio to international fame.
   A world tour followed. But Wailer, who is more at home in the
hills of his native Jamaica than the concert stage, returned home
and vowed never to go on the road again.
   The mystical mountain man busied himself writing and recording
songs on his own label, Solomonic, and farmed the land at the same
time.
   ``I think I love the country actually a little bit more than the
city,'' Wailer said. ``It has more to do with life, health and
strength. The city takes that away sometimes. The country is good
for meditation. It has fresh food and fresh atmosphere _ that keeps
you going.''
   This year, he launched a tour to support his ``Liberation'' LP,
which took him to 13 cities in the United States.
   His recent performance at Radio City Music Hall with the Switch
Dance Troupe marked his first New York appearance since selling out
Madison Square Garden in a solo concert nearly three years ago.
   Wailer was born Neville O'Reilly Livingston 42 years ago. His
career began in 1963 in a Kingston, Jamaica slum when he and his
childhood friend, Robert Nesta Marley, teamed with Winston Hubert
McIntosh, later to be known as Peter Tosh, to form the legendary
group, the Wailers.
   After the release of their first hit, ``Simmer Down'' in 1964,
the Wailers' popularity spread throughout Jamaica. By 1966, they had
five records in the Jamaican Top 10. But the pulsating sound of
reggae went largely unnoticed by the rest of the world until the
``Catch a Fire'' LP.
   On their first tour, they met thunderous applause as audiences
throughout the world jammed stadiums, packed concert and theater
stages and lined dance halls to catch a glimpse of those ``natty
dreadlocks'' from Jamaica.
   While Marley and Tosh lost no time blazing international trails
for themselves, Wailer headed for the Jamaican countryside to be
close to nature.
   Marley, whose ``I Shot the Sheriff'' was covered by such rockers
as Eric Clapton, and who had become the biggest of the reggae stars,
died of a brain tumor at the age of 36 in 1981.
   Tosh, who left the Wailers in 1973 and formed his own group,
Word, Sound and Power, was nominated for a Grammy for the LP
``Captured Live'' in 1985. He was gunned down and killed in his
Jamaican home on Sept. 11, 1987 at the age of 42.
   Marley and the Wailers did more to popularize and refine reggae
than any other artists. They had hits with ``Stir It Up,'' ``Get Up,
Stand Up,'' ``No Woman, No Cry'' and ``Could You Be Loved.''
   Bunny Wailer considers himself just as much a farmer as a
musician, and helped provide food for victims of Hurricane Gilbert
last fall.
   ``Sometimes people pay less attention to those things (food) but
they turn out to be the most important things. I am a farmer,'' said
Wailer, who was in the United States when the hurricane smashed into
the Caribbean island.
   Wailer chartered a jet, filled it with food and flew to Jamaica.
When Wailer returned to his farm on the border of Portland and St.
Thomas parishes, he found his home undamaged.
   ``Liberation,'' his fourth album on the Shanachi label, includes
messages on hunger, drug abuse, apartheid and freedom. The LP also
contains a copy of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
   ``Based on the history it projects, it's taken 400 years to
write,'' Wailer said in an interview. ``When I said I was going into
the studio, that only took four months. But to get all these things
together, it has taken my lifetime and so many other lifetimes
before.''
   Wailer was joined on portions of the ``Liberation'' tour by
Tosh's son, Andrew, and the Grammy-winning Ziggy Marley, Bob
Marley's son.

   When a network wants to give you a prime-time
show, ``aimless wandering'' is probably not the best concept to try
to sell to them.
   But if his sitcom-slash-standup show ``The Seinfeld Chronicles''
does well enough on Wednesday to become a midseason replacement on
NBC, that's what comedian Jerry Seinfeld hopes it will evolve into.
   ``The Seinfeld Chronicles'' has a great cast, smart writing and
an unusual format, intercutting a sitcom with Seinfeld's stand-up
comedy act. Seinfeld is basically playing himself, a stand-up
comedian named Jerry who is a bachelor.
   Seinfeld and co-writer Larry David, also a stand-up comic, came
up with the idea ``over a couple of cups of coffee on Eighth Avenue
one night.
   ``I said, `NBC is interested in doing some kind of show with me,
and I don't have any ideas.' We figured why not just do a show about
how comedians live and how they work and how it happens.''
   ``A lot of'' the show is very much like Seinfeld's own life, he
said from Los Angeles. ``I mean, it was easy for me to do it, I'm
really not acting. Watching TV and sitting in a coffee shop _ that's
what comedians do.''
   With the time spent on Jerry's standup routine, a half-hour isn't
much time to tell much of a story, which is why Seinfeld would just
as soon dispense with a plotline. ``I want to have a show of aimless
wandering through life. But we figure that's a good way to get
audiences interested in the beginning. I mean, it will always be
some sort of progression of events, but we want to structure it very
loosely.
   ``If they pick it up, it's going to progress in a different
direction from that show. It's going to be much more an interior
monologue'' that would show what Seinfeld is thinking and how he
incorporates everyday experiences into a comedy routine.
   David, who was a writer-performer on ABC's ``Fridays'' and a
writer on ``Saturday Night Live,'' does a standup act that seems to
be so personal, it can be almost painful to watch. Pair him with the
more mainstream Seinfeld, and the result is an honest, warm and
amusing examination of life in the late '80s.
   Jason Alexander, who won a Tony award as best actor in a musical
for ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway,'' plays George, Jerry's neurotic
manager. Another ``Fridays'' veteran, Michael Richard, who more
recently starred in the syndicated ``Marblehead Manor,'' plays
Seinfeld's oddball neighbor, Hoffman.
   In the pilot, Jerry has met a woman on the road who is coming to
New York to visit. Does she want to sleep with him or not? George
puts him through an angst-wringing analysis of her possible motives.
   Jerry, observing decorum, obtains a spare bed for the visitor.
George is stricken. ``I can't believe you're bringing in an extra
bed for a woman who wants to sleep with you! Why don't you bring in
an extra guy, too?''
   Hoffman shows up ``to borrow meat'' and stays to complain about
the Mets' loss, spoiling the game for Jerry, who had taped it and
``avoided human contact all day'' so he could watch it in suspense.
   Viewers of ``The Tonight Show'' and ``Late Night'' have probably

   In an experiment at fitting the punishment to the
criminal as well as the crime, Maricopa County judges are preparing
to borrow from their European counterparts by imposing fines tied to
an offender's daily income.
   ``We think over the next 10 years, as counties and states
struggle with jail overcrowding, the fine will become a more and
more attractive option for judges,'' said Judith Greene of the Vera
Institute of Justice, which is running the test of ``day fines'' for
non-violent felonies that starts in December.
   Even with such alternatives as community service and home
detention, she said, the number of inmates has doubled in the last
10 years.
   Day fines were first tried in Finland in 1921, and are widely
used in Western Europe. Courts in Sweden, England and West Germany
impose fines as the sole penalty in 80 percent to 85 percent of all
convictions, Ms. Greene said.
   By contrast, judges in the United States tend to impose fines
below the statutory limits in the interest of consistency, which
reduces their deterrent effect and penalizes defendants with lower
incomes, she said.
   ``The word `afterthought' is used,'' said B. Michael Dann,
presiding judge of the county's Superior Court. ``The thinking is
that too many judges think of the fine after the other penalties and
think, `I'll just tack this on _ you can pay $500 _ that kind of
attitude.'
   ``Among the purposes of the study is to help come up with a
system of means-based fines tied both to the severity of the offense
and the defendant's ability, or anticipated ability, to pay ...
thereby impacting the wealthy and the ne'er-do-well forger in
roughly the same way.''
   Maricopa County's will be the first U.S. court to test the idea
for felonies. In a test in misdemeanor cases last year in Richmond
County on New York's Staten Island, day fines for theft ranged from
$25 for a welfare mother to nearly $4,000 for someone with annual
income of more than $35,000.
   The fines are a perfect vehicle for restitution _ federal judges
frequently turn over fines to victims _ and they safeguard
defendants' rights because of a two-step process in setting the
amounts, Ms. Greene said.
   First, the judge sentences an offender to a certain number of
``fine units'' based on the severity of the offense but regardless
of income. The next step is assigning a value to each fine unit as a
share of the defendant's daily income. The judge then multiplies
that value by the number of fine units.
   Day fines would work best in local jurisdictions, ``where the
individual most likely has a steady job and will continue to work in
the community,'' said Jeffrey Washington of the American
Correctional Association in Laurel, Md.
   On the federal level, offenders might be more likely to skip out
on the fine, and the problems would start with the question of who
would collect, he said. ``You've got the Bureau of Prisons, the U.S.
Sentencing Commission, the U.S. Treasury ... or would you create
another branch of government?''
   The New York-based Vera Institute, a privately funded,
organization credited for research that persuaded Congress to enact
a bail-reform law in 1966, picked Maricopa County Superior Court
because of its reputation.
   ``The court has been a leader nationally ... in the development
of techniques for speeding case processing and controlling
disposition time,'' Ms. Greene said. ``It also has been a site for
experiments _ bail guidelines for one _ and currently is involved in
an experiment with urine surveillance of criminal offenders.''
   Arizona has strong mandatory-sentencing laws, but legislators
said they shouldn't conflict with the day fines. ``Incarceration is
our most expensive response, and we should avoid it except where
absolutely necessary,'' said Democrat state Sen. Jones Osborne, a
member of the Senate Judicial Committee.
   Planners have begun an eight-month study of 20 criminal judges in
Maricopa County and of a sentencing structure based on fines, Ms.
Greene said. The first fines will be imposed in December.
   Dann said he couldn't order judges to participate but would
encourage them to do so. Arizona law sets a general limit of
$150,000 in fines on all classes of felonies, giving his judges
plenty of latitude for the experiment.
   White-collar crimes would be a likely offense to be punished by
day fines, he said. ``Even if it's low-level violence ... something
non-repetitive, that might qualify. It depends on the level or type.
   ``Assault in a barroom _ and those still occur in the Wild West _
can for these purposes be treated differently from a mugging or an
assault on the street, or sexual assault.''
   Steve Twist, an assistant state attorney general, said day fines
might have possibilities if they were strictly limited to
non-violent offenders and if restitution to victims had first call
on the money collected.
   ``I would be cautious that ... they not just look at what the
person was convicted of,'' he said. ``In a plea bargain, a person
actually could commit an armed robbery but be convicted of theft.''
   On the other side of the courtroom, Harold Higgins, who resigned
in June as chief public defender in Pima County, said he liked the
idea of keeping non-violent offenders out of jail.
   ``I think we're sending way too many people to prison that don't
need to go to prison,'' Higgins said. Fining ``might be viable, so
long as it's not used to discriminate against people who can't
afford to buy into it.
   ``So, with that one caveat, it sounds like a good deal.''

   A new breed of filmmakers is leaving a
deep imprint on West German consciousness with movies about Turks
trapped between the ways of their new German homeland and
traditional customs of their own kin.
   ``Right now these movies are in the vanguard of German films,
they are among the best in the whole country,'' said Frank Gethke,
deputy head of the German Film and Television Academy in West Berlin.
   Critics are mesmerized by the new films portraying the struggles
of Turks in a modern, and sometimes unfriendly, Western society.
   One of the new movies, ``Yasemin,'' by German director Hark Bohm,
won top prize at the prestigious German Film Awards in West Berlin.
   Another movie, Tevfik Baser's ``Abschied vom Falschen Paradies''
(``Farewell to a False Paradise''), was among the nation's Top 10
films. Baser is Turkish-born, and is building a reputation as one of
West Germany's leading film directors.
   Turks are West Germany's largest foreign minority, numbering more
than 1.5 million. They are often targets of intense resentment by
many natives, who see them as unfair competition for scarce jobs and
housing.
   The latest films by Bohm and Baser try to bridge a sizeable
cultural gap.
   ``These films aim to improve Germans' understanding about the
Turkish minority living among them, and I think they succeed,''
Gethke said.
   Baser's and Bohm's films portray young Turkish people not only
isolated within Western culture, but also under intense pressure
from their conservative families to be wary of Western ideals.
   In Bohm's film, a young Hamburg man falls in love with a
progressive-minded Turkish girl, Yasemin, but the relationship is an
impossible one because of her family's strong resistance.
   Baser first impressed critics three years ago with ``40 m2
Deutschland'' (``40 Square Meters of Germany''), a fictional movie
about a woman named Turna locked up by her strict husband in a seedy
Hamburg apartment after they arrived in West Germany from Turkey.
The German-language film takes its name from the minuscule size of
the couple's new home.
   Turna revolts against her husband's efforts to isolate her from
Western ways, but fails to find freedom even after he dies during an
epileptic fit. The desperate woman suddenly faces a culture in which
she cannot even understand what her neighbors are saying, and is
left completely without friends.
   Baser tracks similar themes in ``Farewell to a False Paradise,''
based on the true story about a young Turkish woman who is sent to
jail for killing her Turkish husband after he brutalizes her. She
finds happiness behind prison walls, totally casting off her
family's male-dominated customs.
   But in the end, she is to be deported after her release from the
``false paradise'' of prison, and she contemplates killing herself
rather than having to return to a homeland which she now considers
completely foreign.
   ``Farewell to a False Paradise'' launched the Turkish-born
actress Zuhal Olcay into sudden stardom in West Germany, and she won
best actress honors at the German film awards.

<HEAD>Germans Focus on Artistic Films in American-Dominated Industry</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MUNICH, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   German filmgoers get action and
adventure from directors like Steven Spielberg, most of their laughs
from the likes of Mel Brooks and doses of irony and social
commentary from the works of Woody Allen.
   Throughout the four decades since an independent film industry
was re-established in West Germany, American film has dominated the
market, pushing German movies to the fringes.
   American films have accounted for at least eight of the Top 10
box-office draws this year, vacating a rung only occasionally for
German successes such as Joseph Vilsmaier's ``Herbstmilch'' or Xaver
Schwarzenberger's ``With the Next Man Everything Will Be Different.''
   ``We don't try to compete with Hollywood,'' said Bernhard Kock, a
film historian and spokesman for West Germany's largest studio,
Bavaria Film. ``American films always have been the major box-office
successes here, and that situation is unlikely to change.''
   Rather than aiming for the general audiences who love American
comedies and dramas, German filmmakers have concentrated on a
unique, artistic and often avant-garde genre.
   ``It's difficult to say what makes a film German, but there is a
certain something, a weight that they carry,'' Kock observed.
   A handful of young filmmakers have made some recent forays into
more conventional subjects with relative success, helping to boost
the share of theater tickets sold for German films to a post-war
high of nearly 20 percent.
   But in a market that has fallen from 800 million tickets a year
in the bleak years after World War II, to about 100 million in the
age of video and vast new entertainment options, German film is
anything but a growth industry.
   Director Doris Doerrie, whose 1986 satire, ``Men,'' was one of
the few German box-office smashes of the decade, says the
unconventional thread running through many West German films is an
outgrowth of the complicated subsidy system that keeps the industry
alive.
   ``Filmmakers are a lot more likely to get grants for artistic
productions, and once you get the money, there is no pressure for
commercial success,'' she said in a recent interview.
   While that easing of financial and marketing worries allows a
freer atmosphere for the filmmaker, it poses little incentive for
directors to aim for audiences seeking entertainment over artistic
value.
   Government subsidies have backed the West German industry since
it was allowed to reorganize in the late 1940s during the post-war
allied occupation.
   Germany has a rich film legacy, dating back to the expressionism
of 1919-30, which produced such landmarks as ``The Cabinet of Dr.
Caligari,'' ``Nosferatu'' and ``Metropolis.''
   In the first years after the Nazi defeat, American occupiers
imported Hollywood movies, using them to promote development of a
democratic society. According to film historian Thomas Guback in his
book, ``The International Film Industry,'' this helped establish
Hollywood's grip on the German market.
   All German films made prior to 1945 were seized and kept out of
circulation while the military governments, encouraged by Hollywood
lobbyists to take their time, slowly returned those deemed free of
Nazi propaganda to the theaters.
   ``What also played a role was the financial attractiveness for
the allies to block rebuilding of the German film industry and keep
the market open for their own films,'' said film historian Isa van
Eeghen.
   Recovery has been slow. And despite West Germany's economic
prosperity, filmmaking requires government and television revenues
to keep production at about 60 new films per year _ half the number
released during the late '50s.
   Some of the most successful contemporary films by West German
directors have been co-produced with American and other foreign
companies, resulting in a multinational hybrid art form that is
beginning to characterize European cinema.
   A number of German directors have moved their entire operations
to Los Angeles, including Wolfgang Petersen, whose 1981 submarine
drama, ``Das Boot,'' was the most successful West German film ever
marketed abroad.
   But some German filmmakers have found their styles to be
incompatible with the more rigid and profit-oriented American system.
   Wim Wenders and Volker Schloendorff have recently returned to
West Germany after Hollywood successes with their productions,
respectively, of ``Paris, Texas,'' and ``Death of a Salesman.''
   Wenders complained in a recent interview with the Bonn daily Die
Welt that ``Hollywood is too controlled,'' stifling the creativity
and spontaneity he considers crucial to good directing.
   ``Producers want to know everything about the film they are
responsible for,'' he said. ``Films are designed in Hollywood like
cars are built in Detroit: Everything has to be worked out
beforehand.''
   While the flow of talent between the United States and Europe has
diluted the earnest tone that was unique to German film in the '60s
and '70s, directors working on both sides of the Atlantic contend
the exchange is enriching.
   ``I grew up watching American films, but I never understood the
whole process behind them until I worked in the United States,''
said Doerrie, whose 1988 film ``Me and Him'' was produced by
Columbia Pictures. ``I don't think my work can be described as
entirely German.''

   Arne Elsholtz looks nothing like Tom Hanks, and
it's hard to mistake Helmut Krauss for Mister Ed.
   Though their faces may be unfamiliar, their voices are well-known
to millions of German TV and movie fans. Elsholtz and Krauss are
among scores of actors in West Germany's dubbing industry, which for
40 years has been putting German words into the mouths of American
stars from Mickey Mouse to Tom Cruise.
   In his 20-year career, Arne Elsholtz has been Tom Hanks in
``Splash,'' Kevin Kline in ``A Fish Called Wanda'' and Bill Murray
in ``Ghostbusters.'' He has translated and directed scores of other
dubbing projects at West Berlin's renowned Berliner Synchron studios.
   ``I don't think of myself as being like Tom Hanks, but I do like
to have fun, and that's important for dubbing a funny American movie
like `Splash,''' said the 47-year-old Elsholtz.
   Krauss, who also has a contract with Berliner Synchron, is the
German voice of Mister Ed, the talking horse in the popular 1950s
American TV series.
   American fans might lift an eyebrow to hear the garrulous horse
uttering a cheerful ``Guten Tag, Wilbur!'' instead of ``Hiya,
Wilbur.'' But it's the job of the dubbers to make a production
understandable to Germans.
   Every evening millions of Germans cozy up to their TV sets to
watch some of their favorite German programs. But some of the most
popular shows are American imports like ``Dallas,'' ``The Bill Cosby
Show'' and ``Dynasty'' _ all dubbed.
   American films are also immensely popular among Germans.
Hollywood movies often dominate film listings in West German TV
program guides as well.
   Why the fascination with Hollywood movies and sometimes ancient
American television series?
   It's pretty much a money matter combined with the vast
availability of American video entertainment, said Joachim Kuester,
head of Berliner Synchron. ``The German television networks have
hours to be filled, and it is too expensive to produce much stuff.
So they fill it up with American productions.''
   Kuester said it is far less expensive to dub an American film or
television program under contract with its U.S. owners than to make
one from scratch.
   However, he concedes dubbing over the distinctive voices of Woody
Allen, Groucho Marx, Robin Williams and other actors alters the
character's original qualities. But the option _ subtitles _ could
cause a popular uprising.
   ``Our audiences won't accept subtitles,'' he said. ``It's more
relaxing to sit there and listen to the movie in German.''

<HEAD>`Cyclical' Stocks Lagged in First Half of '89</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Though it has been hard to see until very
recently in the behavior of the overall stock market, investors have
been hedging their bets for some time now against the possibility of
a recession.
   That conclusion emerges from the relatively weak showing through
the first half of 1989 by the auto, steel and other stock groups
that are traditionally regarded as most sensitive to the ups and
downs of the economy.
   In a compilation of all major stock groups from the start of the
year through late June by Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., such
``cyclicals'' dominated the list of the weakest performers.
   Over a span in which the broad market averages posted gains of 15
to 20 percent, the S&amp;P auto group index dropped 2 percent and steels
eked out a 2 percent gain.
   ``It sure doesn't feel like a `soft landing' in Detroit,''
observed Edward Yardeni, economist at Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc., in a recent commentary on the state of the auto industry.
   Yardeni noted that auto sales have been lagging behind the number
of cars built in recent months, prompting production cutbacks that
include a big planned drop this month.
   ``We still don't expect an economy-wide hard landing,'' said
Yardeni, ``but we will be watching developments in the auto industry
with a great deal of interest. Autos are still a big chunk of the
economy.''
   Also among the first-half laggards in S&amp;P's tabulation were paper
containers, up 4.1 percent; metal and glass containers, up 2.4
percent; truckers, down 7.7 percent, and ``miscellaneous
transportation,'' down 2.1 percent.
   Demand for containers and volume of shipping are traditionally
linked very closely to the pace of the economy.
   If enthusiasm for the business outlook wasn't so hot, what
accounted for the solid gains racked up by the market as a whole in
the first half?
   For one thing, falling interest rates, which lit a fire under
such interest-rate sensitive groups as homebuilding, up 48.9
percent, and savings and loans, which climbed 37.2 percent despite
much-publicized problems in the thrift industry.
   In addition, there was the continued bubbling pot of takeover
news and rumors, which made star performers out of such disparate
stocks as Time Inc., Sea Containers Ltd., NWA Inc. and Gordon
Jewelry.
   The runup in NWA, parent of Northwest Airlines, along with
speculation about possible bids for other carriers, helped propel
the S&amp;P airline index to a 45.4 percent gain.
   The strongest group of all _ entertainment companies, up 49.7
percent _ had the benefit not only of the merger frenzy, but also of
box-office records as several summer movies opened to great fanfare
in the waning weeks of the second quarter.
   While investors reached midyear in a cautious mood about the
corporate earnings outlook, there were still some standout stocks
that benefited from impressive profit gains in the first half.
   For example, L.A. Gear, the latest Wall Street favorite in the
athletic footwear race, soared from the low $20s to the high $50s,
for a gain of more than 160 percent.
   The company posted a near-tripling of profits for the fiscal
quarter ended May 31 and reported that its order backlogs were still
rising.
   Shares of Federal National Mortgage Association, playing an
increasingly profitable role in the growing business of buying,
packaging and reselling mortgages, racked up a gain of nearly 80
percent to around $90.
   For risk-takers, there were even better ways than Fannie Mae's
common stock to profit from the company's prosperity.
   Fannie Mae warrants, securities that give their holders the right
to buy the stock at $44.25 a share, shot up more than 250 percent to
rank as the single biggest first-half winner among New York Stock
Exchange issues.

<HEAD>Debate Continues: Are Thomas Wolfe's Last Works a Fraud?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE DREYFOUS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Thomas Wolfe died suddenly in 1938,
he left behind a 10,000-page mishmash of a manuscript that
eventually wound up divided in three and served up as his last works.
   Literary scholars have debated for years whether ``The Web and
the Rock'' and ``You Can't Go Home Again'' really are Wolfe's work.
They and a subsequent volume of short stories were carved from a
trunkful of jumbled pages.
   ``It's a literary crime,'' said John Halberstadt, a Wolfe fan and
literature scholar. He was shocked when he learned through research
that his favorite author's last works had been extensively rewritten
by an editor at Harper &amp; Brothers (now Harper &amp; Row).
   Halberstadt spent the better part of the 1970s at Harvard
University's manuscript library tracking and cataloging changes the
editor, Edward Aswell, made. He based his Yale University doctoral
dissertation on his findings.
   In his paper, ``The Making of Thomas Wolfe's Posthumous Works,''
Halberstadt charged that in patching together the works, Aswell
scrambled sequences, reordered chapters, made deep cuts, added his
own words and in some cases blended separate characters into one.
   His allegations reignited a controversy that had flared
intermittently since 1962, when Richard S. Kennedy, a Temple
University professor, published a similar study. Once again, the
provenance of Wolfe's work was being called into question, and the
Wolfean establishment was again choosing sides.
   Wolfe's hometown paper, The Asheville (N.C.) Citizen, in a banner
headline in the early 1980s, asked: ``Thomas Wolfe _ Who Wrote the
Last Books?''
   R.W.B. Lewis, a Pulitzer Prize-winning professor at Yale and an
adviser to Halberstadt, wrote in his report on the dissertation:
``In years past, I have often taught `The Web and the Rock' in
American literature courses; after reading Halberstadt, I would not
dream of doing so again. It would be teaching an unacknowledged and
profoundly misleading hybrid.''
   The literary world has been aware of Aswell's impact for years
and it is generally accepted that he did the best he could with what
he had, Kennedy said in an interview from his Pennsylvania home.
   But Halberstadt says the works are fraudulent and should include
a clear note explaining the ``heavy-handed'' editing. When he tried
to publish his thesis and make his charges public, he says he was
denied the right by Paul Gitlin, the executor of Wolfe's estate.
   So he decided to publish an article based on his research in The
Yale Review's autumn 1980 issue without the requisite permission
from the manuscript library and copyright owner of the papers. That
got him banned from Harvard's Houghton Library, where the world's
largest Wolfe collection is housed.
   Neither the Wolfean establishment nor the executor of the
author's literary estate looked kindly on Halberstadt's approach.
But he says his campaign to have the full manuscript published
commercially so doubters can see for themselves Aswell's impact on
the novels has been gaining steam.
   Last month, he was permitted to give a lecture on his theories
during The Thomas Wolfe Society's annual meeting in Cambridge.
Halberstadt said he had applied repeatedly over the last decade and
took this year's nod as a sign that he was coming back into the
group's good graces.
   Gitlin, who has been executor of Wolfe's papers for more than 20
years, says his opinion of Halberstadt has not changed.``He's not a
scholar. ... he's a publicity hound,'' Gitlin said in a telephone
interview from New York.
   He said it was generally accepted that Aswell had the approval of
then-executor and literary agent Maxwell Perkins. ``There have been
accusations of skulduggery and that Aswell rewrote the book. I think
(the editor) did the best he could. He was very brave to take on
that manuscript.''
   Kennedy agreed with Gitlin that ``the world is pretty grateful
that Aswell managed to get this material into print. It constitutes
about half of Wolfe's published career.''
   Gitlin and editors at Harper &amp; Row said they had never received a
bid to publish the entire 10,000-page typescript, and Kennedy said
there were simple reasons. It would have been extremely costly,
``unreadable and incoherent.''
   Halberstadt claims Northeastern University, his former employer,
proposed several years ago to publish the manuscript along with his
dissertation. He says they were denied. But Gitlin said the rebuff
was based on the particular scholar involved and not the issue.
   ``If Richard Kennedy approached me and said he would like to do
the original manuscript with footnotes and even if he wanted to
attack Aswell, it wouldn't bother me at all,'' the executor said.
``He's a fine scholar.''
   Halberstadt says the lonely fight will go on.
   ``We're talking here about the reader's right to know about the
secret profession of editing,'' he said. ``I don't think anyone has
the right to fulfill an author's intentions on a scale unprecedented
in American literature.''

   The young woman's enthusiasm was
contagious. ``I did it, I did it,'' she said, smiling broadly and
barely standing still after casting her first vote in a democratic
election.
   The right to vote is taken for granted _ and often ignored _ in
countries with a longer tradition of rule by and for the people.
   But in Eastern Europe, brutalized by 50 years of war, Stalinism,
police repression, false propaganda and economic mismanagement, that
simple act in the Polish national elections June 4 seemed nothing
short of a miracle.
   Communist rule came to Eastern Europe as the result of the World
War II military might of the Soviet Union, but perestroika and
glasnost under Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev are giving
countries that used to be referred to as ``satellites'' the leeway
to experiment with democracy.
   Economic pressures are also helping the cause of political
reforms.
   With communist economies proven unable to compete with the West
in a high-technology age, the ideological rationale for
Marxism-Leninism _ that it makes life better for the common man and
woman _ has been stripped away.
   In the course of one or two years, the concept of free
competition among different political parties has gone from being an
unimaginable dream to being hoped for and even counted on in Poland
and Hungary.
   Poles and Hungarians will even get a rare, firsthand look at the
leader of a Western democracy this month, when President Bush stops
to visit prior to the annual summit of industrialized democracies in
Paris.
   Bush will find a Poland that has just held the first democratic
parliamentary elections since World War II, in which candidates
backed by the Solidarity movement took 99 of the 100 seats.
   The elections to the Sejm were not free; the opposition was
allowed only to run for 35 percent of the seats. Solidarity took all
161 of those. Its platform: Remove the party's ``leading role'' and
hold free elections in four years.
   In Hungary, that might be too slow. A commission is working to
draft a constitution expected to provide for fully free multiparty
elections as early as next year. It also will guarantee free speech,
independent courts and other human rights.
   The rapid pace of democratic change in Hungary was underlined by
the reburial with honors June 16 of Imre Nagy, leader of the 1956
anti-Soviet revolt, who was executed for treason. Hundreds of
thousands of people were on hand for the ceremony and joined a
veteran of 1956 in swearing: ``We will never again be slaves.''
   Party leaders in Poland and Hungary have been quoted as saying
they hope the Communist Party will win planned free elections in the
future, but if not, the party will accept the voters' verdict and
relinquish power.
   In Poland, the opposition is led by Lech Walesa and the
Solidarity movement which embraces workers, intellectuals and much
of the powerful Roman Catholic Church. In Hungary, reform is mainly
the work of intellectuals, including a potent liberal wing of the
communist party itself.
   Both countries already have seen the spontaneous reformation of
long-banned political parties and associations, as if they only were
in suspended animation for the past half century. There also are
totally new political grouping, such as environmentally conscious
``Greens.''
   Elsewhere in Eastern Europe, democratization is not so advanced,
where it exists at all. What is happening in Poland and Hungary has
raised hopes among some citizens while disquieting the mostly aging
leaderships.
   East Germany and Romania, the most hardline states, have
commented with dismay on Hungary's move toward democracy. ``Under
the flag of `renewing socialism,' forces are at work that strive for
removing socialism,'' said East German Politburo member Joachim
Herrman. Romania said the ceremonies to honor Nagy were ``clearly
fascist, anti-socialist in nature.''
   Both countries brook no dissent. In Romania, dissidents are
jailed while in East Germany they are likely to find themselves
deported to the West.
   In Prague, the Czechoslovak leadership has paid enthusiastic lip
service to the Kremlin reforms, but failed so far to implement them
amid an ongoing, if secretive debate about whether change is needed.
   In Bulgaria, leader Todor Zhivkov remains true to a lifetime of
skillfully aping whatever policy holds sway in Moscow. In July 1987,
he embraced economic reform, exciting Bulgaria's intelligentsia and
younger technocrats.
   But Zhivkov and longtime comrades on the ruling Poltiburo blocked
dissent within the party last year. Dissident groups, the first seen
in four decades of communist rule, are closely watched by security
forces and troublemakers are expelled.
   In Yugoslavia, the communist party leadership in Slovenia, the
most economically advanced of the country's six republics, has
tolerated a broad degree of pluralism, while rejecting demands for
multiparty democracy from mushrooming independent groups. Those
calls have been echoed by intellectuals in Croatia and Servia, the
two largest republics, but ethnic tensions among the republics have
complicated any broad alliance for reform.
   Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, however, uses authoritarian
tactics and insists on one-party, orthodox communist rule, putting
him at odds with other republics _ particularly the Slovenes, who
are now threatening secession if conflicts go unresolved.

   The Kremlin's influence here isn't limited
to the troops in the street _ Poland also has Soviet television,
cars, books and newspapers and mandatory Russian language lessons
through high school.
   A changing political climate in Poland and Hungary, where
President Bush will visit next week, has emboldened citizens of the
two countries in recent years to openly express long-silenced
resentment of the Soviet presence.
   At the reburial ceremony in Budapest on June 16 for Imre Nagy,
leader of the 1956 revolt, Viktor Orban of the independent youth
group Fidesz drew loud applause when he advised: ``If we muster
enough courage, then we can put an end to communist dictatorship,
and we can make sure that the immediate withdrawal of Soviet troops
is begun.''
   And in the southern Polish city of Krakow, marches by young
people chanting ``Sowiecki do domu,'' (``Soviets go home,'') have
become regular events. The youth often try to march on the city's
Soviet consulate, and once vandalized a monument to Red Army war
dead, prompting an apology to the Soviet ambassador by Prime
Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski.
   The Red Army is officially on hand to defend the Warsaw Pact
countries from a NATO invasion, but many Poles and Hungarians regard
it as little more than an occupation force to guarantee continued
communist rule. It was Soviet troops who put down Hungary's
anti-communist revolt in 1956 and led the Warsaw Pact forces who
toppled Czechoslovakia's reform government in 1968.
   In recent weeks, the Red Army started withdrawing 50,000 troops
from East Germany, Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia in a pullback
that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev announced in December as
part of plans to cut the Soviet army by 500,000 troops by 1991.
   The announced cutbacks, which are to include 5,000 tanks, affect
about 10 percent of Soviet forces in Eastern Europe. Though welcomed
almost universally, the cuts have not quenched popular sentiment for
even more.
   The Soviet presence in Poland is not limited to the troops.
   One of three TV stations in Warsaw is relayed via satellite from
Moscow. Soviet television also can be seen in the Wroclaw-Legnica
area, where Soviet troops are concentrated. But the Soviet channel
is not widely watched because of the antipathy many Poles feel
toward the Soviet Union and the fact that many do not understand
Russian despite the school requirements.
   Soviet Lada cars are popular in Poland and are considered by many
residents to be superior to Polish-made Fiats and Polonezes. They
are mainly purchased with hard currency through state dollar shops
or private importing agencies.
   Soviet bookstores are in most major cities, and Pravda is widely
available.
   Towering over central Warsaw is the monolithic Palace of Culture
and Science, a much muttered-about gift from Josef Stalin's Soviet
Union. An oft-told joke in Poland says the best view of Warsaw is
from the top of the Palace of Culture because that is the only place
from which one can't see the Palace of Culture.
   Most Poles rarely see the estimated 40,000 Soviet troops among
them. The units remain secluded in tree- and fence-surrounded bases
away from towns. They are rarely mentioned in the press or state
broadcasts, except in the case of the occasional military accident
that has to be explained.
   Only in a few places like Legnica, the site of Soviet military
headquarters 260 miles southwest of Warsaw, is it common to see
young Russian or Asian soldiers on the street.
   Hungarians do not hide their dislike of the troops. A hotel
waiter in Esztergom near the Czechoslovak border, when asked by
Western diners about the helicopter noise outside, answered with
disdain and a deprecating gesture: ``The Soviets.'' Hungarian
officials have long insisted that their country be included in the
first phase of any withdrawal.
   In Poland, there is a long antagonism toward the Soviet Union.
   The countries warred in 1920, Soviet troops occupied eastern
Poland in 1939 two weeks after Nazis invaded from the west, and over
the next decade hundreds of thousands of Poles were deported to the
Soviet Union. Many thousands died, including 4,200 Polish officers
executed at Katyn.
   Only recently has it become possible for Poles to speak openly
about this painful past, after decades of propaganda proclaiming
unblemished friendship between the Polish and Soviet people.
   But whenever anti-Soviet feelings threaten to become too shrill,
leaders in Poland and Hungary hasten to point out that the
transformations under way in their countries depend on Gorbachev's
reforms at home.
   ``Political reforms under way in the Soviet Union are
indispenable international conditions for the success of endeavors
for democratic socialism,'' Hungarian Premier Miklos Nemeth
emphasized in a June interview.
   Hungarian officials have flirted publicly with the idea of a
``neutral Hungary'' someday, but only if both military blocs were
dissolved.
   In Poland, some opposition pragmatists state a need for a defense
alliance with the Soviet Union even if Poland becomes totally
democratic.
   Despite resentment of the Soviet military presence, Gorbachev and
his reform program are popular here. Leading figures in the
independent Solidarity movement have led the cheering for
perestroika and have come back from Moscow with enthusiastic
accounts of its progress.
   But many people still ask: Will it last?
   ``The American people think that Gorbachev can change a lot, but
we know the Soviet Union so much better,'' said one architecture
student in a Warsaw park, declining to give his name.

   At Budapest's Deli station, a cluster of
old people, many in well-cut clothes grown shabby with wear,
welcomes the train from Vienna each morning.
   They clutch signs written in German offering rooms for rent.
   As pensioners surviving on as little as $60 a month, they need
cash from tourists who will pay, perhaps even in coveted hard
currency, for a bed.
   A Warsaw housewife, Maria, knows a retired professor who lives on
a monthly pension of less than $25.
   ``She has to sell everything she has in order to live,'' says
Maria, who asked that her last name not be used. ``Clothes,
ceramics, everything.''
   The pensioners are some of the millions of people failed by 40
years of Stalinism in Eastern Europe.
   After World War II, many on a continent ruined by fascism looked
to socialism for peace and prosperity. Soviet communism seemed full
of promise _ jobs, free education and health care, and equality in
societies where a small caste of rich had long dominated the
numerous poor.
   Communism forced heavy industry on traditionally agrarian areas,
while the ``bourgeois capitalists'' who could have managed the new
factories were stripped of their property and jailed or deported in
the purges of the 1950s.
   Shoddy buildings sprouted in the name of progress or in place of
historic cities bombed in World War II. A drab sameness descended on
half a continent.
   Today, there is unparalleled pollution, outmoded factories,
struggling agriculture and a 10-year wait for a car or drafty
two-room apartment.
   Beginning in the mid-1960s, when Moscow granted some leeway,
Eastern Europe's economists tried to right wrongs. But
Czechoslovakia, the world's 10th wealthiest nation before World War
II, had its attempts crushed in a 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion.
   Hungary and Poland were more fortunate. By the early 1970s,
partial economic reforms, praised by the Western bankers who helped
finance them, seemed to put both en route to modernity and consumer
plenty.
   Almost two decades later, the Poles, Hungarians and Westerners to
whom the two nations owe a total $54 billion know they were wrong to
expect miracles from economies that were managed by corrupt,
inefficent systems dominated by one party.
   Now that Moscow is permitting the political change it once
forbade, the economic decay and falling living standards in Hungary
and Poland are two motors for reform.
   Politicians eager to satisfy their citizens' craving for Western
consumer goods are permitting more travel and private imports of
videos and other wonders they cannot produce or afford to buy for
precious hard currency.
   A key factor in the delay is the political difficulty of going
back on four decades of promises that the state will care for its
citizens.
   East bloc workers, whose universal maxim is that ``we pretend to
work, and they pretend to pay us,'' are generally disgusted with
Communism, but hardly enthusiastic about the austerity and
double-digit inflation reform has brought.
   Real repairs for the East's economic plight will involve deep
changes and take much longer than a year training course at the
U.S.-funded management school in Budapest.
   Poland and Hungary are ahead of their East bloc allies in
permitting foreign ownership of domestic companies and forging
hundreds of joint ventures with the West.
   In April, Hungary became the first East bloc country to allow a
state-owned enterprise, the relatively successful Tungsram light
bulb company, to be bought by Westerners, an Austrian consortium.
   Eagerly pursuing all possible sources of capital, Hungary broke
East bloc convention and forged diplomatic ties with South Korea.
Samsung Corp. is setting up its first Hungarian factory to
manufacture 300,000 color televisions a year.
   Both Poland and Hungary also have small, private banks. Hungary
even has a fledgling stock exchange.
   But the people who manage them, suave sophisticates who learned
their craft in New York or London, know how long it will be before
their enterprises resemble either.
   ``Ten years, perhaps,'' shrugged the young manager of a new
Austro-Hungarian banking venture.

   To a Soviet tourist accustomed to buying
sugar with ration coupons, or a Romanian surviving for months
without proper meat, a Budapest supermarket is something close to
paradise.
   Piles of paprika and heaps of fruit and vegetables adorn the
shelves. Canned goods, Western beverages and attractively packaged
foods are available _ and there are few lines or shortages.
   But even in Hungary, the traditionally rich agrarian nation that
President Bush will visit next week, the farming success story is
turning sour.
   Almost 60 percent of the machinery on the 1,253 cooperatives and
131 state farms created by forced collectivization in the 1950s is
rusty and outdated.
   The workforce is aging and declining. The prices paid to farmers
are not keeping pace with increases in the cost of fertilizers and
other supplies.
   State investment is declining, with the farmers seeing none of
the extra revenue generated by three rounds of food price increases
imposed by a cash-strapped government this year alone.
   From 1975 to 1987, industrial prices rose 203 percent, but the
money paid to farmers for their produce increased just 64 percent.
   Robert Burgert, the manager of Hungary's most successful state
farm, found it more profitable to invest his farm's money in
Budapest's infant bond market than in his land at Balbona in western
Hungary.
   The farmers' anger at their worsening situation boiled over a
year ago, when winegrowers in Kiskoros staged the first agricultural
demonstration in memory, demanding change.
   With even official statistics showing a 20 percent decline in
agricultural production from 1987 to 1988, and politicians
increasingly willing to reform, the winegrowers may get their wish.
   A report commissioned by the ruling Communist Party has just
recommended a wholesale return to easy lease terms and private land
ownership in agriculture.
   Everywhere in eastern Europe, the small private farms and plots
left intact by communism already account for a vastly
disproportionate share of food produced.
   In Hungary, for example, private household plots that cover only
5.5 percent of arable land accounted for 36 percent of all
agricultural production in 1988.
   A return to private ownership also would ease the credit squeeze
on farmers, who cannot use their land as collateral because it has
no market price.
   Undoing four decades of communist farming, however, may prove
politically difficult if it drives subsidized food prices up still
further.
   Already, consumers are feeling the crunch. ``My teen-age sons
like to drink Coca-Cola,'' said Zoltan, a Budapest bureaucrat with a
salary above the monthly average of 6,500 forints (about $100).
``But this year I had to tell them, `We just can't afford it.'''
   In Yugoslavia, where inflation now tops 600 percent a year, and
elsewhere in Eastern Europe, consumers have long grown used to
shelling out large portions of their meager monthly incomes for food.
   Most of these supplies are available only at small markets where
peasants sell produce from their plots.
   In Poland, the first stop on Bush's Eastern Europe itinerary, a
kilo of beef costs 4,000 zlotys (about $5) on the free market, or
some 6 percent of an average monthly wage. In state stores, where
prices are lower but the stock phrase is ``Nie ma'' _ ``There is
none _ beef is almost never seen.
   In Romania, every spare lei chases food. President Nicolae
Ceausescu's drive to pay off foreign debt means that huge amounts of
food are exported and his 23 million citizens, inhabiting an area
once known as the breadbasket of southeastern Europe, face chronic
shortages.
   In many cities, bread is rationed. Butter, cooking oil, cheese or
flour are regularly sold only in hard-currency stores, and a kilo of
coffee on the black market fetches up to 1,500 lei ($150), half the
monthly wage.
   Urban professionals may rise at dawn and line up all day on a
rumor that meat will appear at a local store. When it does, hundreds
of exhausted shoppers turn into angry hordes, screaming at each
other in the fight for a scrawny chicken.
   Such scenes are unknown in Czechoslovakia and East Germany, where
stores are relatively well stocked.
   Shop windows in Prague, famous for its hams, display an enviable
variety of meats and sausage at affordable prices.
   But fruit and vegetables are far more scarce. In June, the
Czechoslovak state news agency revealed that consumption of
vegetables has risen only 8.7 percent since before World War II, and
``does not meet the requirements of healthy nutrition.''
   The average East bloc housewife must manage to feed her family
with almost none of the frozen foods that have become commonplace in
the West. Household appliances to prepare food are also at a
premium. Microwave ovens are unknown unless imported privately from
the West, and even refrigerators are so small that food is often
kept on icy balconies in winter.
   There is also a whole range of foods, from avocados to zucchini,
that are considered common in the West but are virtually unknown in
the East.
   A well-educated Soviet, offered celery by a Westerner, gave an
uncomprehending look. Shown the Russian word for celery in a
dictionary, he beamed with recognition. ``Ah,'' he smiled. ``Celery.
I've seen the word in Tolstoy novels, but I've never eaten it.''

   It's not exactly all work and no play,
but many who live in the Soviet bloc nations of Eastern Europe say
they rarely have either the time or money for recreation.
   ``It is hard to have free time in Poland,'' said a woman who held
a child in each hand as she left a market hall in central Warsaw.
``We have to stand on line and there is nothing in the stores.''
   Romanians often spend up to five hours a day waiting in line for
food because much of the food produced there is exported.
   ``Practically, I have no leisure time _ with work, the home, the
kids,'' a Warsaw businessman said.
   Some Eastern Europeans work as many as three jobs. An air traffic
controller in Poland might also work as a nightclub bouncer, or a
university teacher might moonlight as an exterminator.
   While stores and markets in Hungary are well-stocked with fresh
produce and meat, other consumer items and appliances are in short
supply. Hungarians have grown accustomed to working as long as 16
hours a day to provide needed services.
   Ibolya Kuzsel, a Hungarian woman with a 12-year-old daughter, has
run her husband's workshop since he died last year. Kuzsel rises at
5:30 each morning to do her chores before work; her evenings are
spent on the accounting. Saturdays, she goes to the cemetery.
   ``I have little time for my daughter,'' she said.
   President Bush will spend four days in Poland and Hungary, the
first visit to the Warsaw Pact nations by an American president
since 1977.
   Many Eastern Europeans find inexpensive recreation in television
or weekend trips to the country. And statistics show that alcohol is
a popular escape, despite attempts throughout the bloc to curb its
use.
   Hungarians spend an average of one month's salary on alcohol each
year. That nation has the highest alcohol-related cirrhosis
mortality rate in Europe. Romania is second.
   Western television, especially popular detective series, provides
diversion.
   Those in Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland who can afford it can
buy satellite dishes to pick up Western stations. Soviet television
provides variety for some residents of Romania and Bulgaria.
   Weekend houses or bungalows are popular for residents of
Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland. But even weekends mean work.
   ``We just harvested 100 kilos (220 pounds) of cherries and 400
kilos (880 pounds) of green beans,'' said a young Hungarian
entrepreneur who spends her work week in her tiny toy shop in
Budapest.
   She will can the garden produce for the winter.
   Real vacations are often too costly for most Eastern Europeans to
even consider. A week's vacation in a modest setting for a Polish
family of four could cost three times the average monthly salary.
   Liberalized travel laws are allowing Hungarians more access to
the West, with reasonably priced bus tours to Turkey or Greece
costing about $210. The state travel agency also offers more
exclusive trips, such as a three-week vacation to Australia for
$4,840.

<HEAD>Alternative Coal-Burning Technologies Under Development</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS one graf with cost of MHD retrofit; no pickup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SHARP</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two experimental generating systems being
developed in coal country could be among the answers to President
Bush's call for a 50-percent cut in sulfur dioxide emissions by the
turn of the century.
   The Tennessee Valley Authority is working on a process called
Atmospheric Fluidized Bed Combustion, or AFBC, while the University
of Tennessee Space Institute is focusing on technology called
magnetohydrodynamics, MHD.
   AFBC works by mixing limestone into the coal that is burned as
fuel. The calcium in the limestone mixes with sulfur in the coal to
form calcium sulfate, a heavier material that settles and can be
drained off the bottom.
   MHD burns finely ground coal at very high temperatures, adds a
conductive agent to the resulting gas and passes it through a
powerful magnetic field. The field produces an electric current, and
the still-hot gas can be run through a conventional boiler to
generate more power.
   ``In essence, you get more power out of the same pound of coal,''
said Joel Muehlhauser, director of the program, which has spent $68
million in Department of Energy money since 1977 and was given
another $11.4 million through 1990.
   While MHD is cleaner and more efficient than most conventional
methods, it has drawbacks, including the stress on materials from
the temperatures and the corrosiveness of the gas after a conductor
has been added.
   TVA ran a 20 megawatt pilot plant using AFBC from 1982 until last
year, testing it for 20,000 hours. In October, it opened a
commercial-scale generator at its Shawnee plant near Paducah, Ky.
   It ``is not quite as efficient as a conventional plant with no
pollution control equipment on it,'' said Arnold Manaker, a TVA
engineer. ``It's like an automobile. They get more power without all
the converters on them.''
   But it is cleaner. The pilot plant burns coal with 4 percent
sulfur and has emissions equivalent to a regular plant using 1
percent sulfur coal, which costs nearly twice as much, he said.
   AFBC is relatively expensive to install, however. Manaker said it
would cost about $400 to $800 per kilowatt of generating capacity,
compared to $100 to $300 per kilowatt for scrubbers, which inject a
watery mixture of ground limestone and water into the exhaust gases
to neutralize the acids.
   Retrofitting with MHD would cost about $750 to $1,500 per
kilowatt, said Muehlhauser.

   Sales of new homes rose 2.7 percent in May as
interest rates continued to fall, but analysts predicted that sales
would remain slow because of the weakening economy.
   The Commerce Department said Thursday that sales of new
single-family homes rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
613,000 units in May, but still trailed the 676,000 rate in 1988 and
the 671,000 rate in 1987.
   For the first five months of the year, new home sales were down
7.1 percent from the same period a year earlier.

   T. Boone Pickens, joined by a group of Japanese
racketeers in seeking greater shareholders' rights in Koito
Manufacturing Co., lost his bid for three board seats even though he
is the company's largest shareholder.
   Among the 200 shareholders present Thursday, Pickens' was the
only hand raised in favor of electing himself and two associates to
Koito's 20-member board.
   Pickens, who bought a 20.2 percent stake in the automobile light
maker in March, said his rejection showed that the Japanese
investment market is not as open to Americans as the U.S. market is

   The United States, already the world's largest
debtor nation, strengthened its hold on that dubious title in 1988
as its foreign debt surged 41 percent to $532.5 billion, according
to government figures.
   The Commerce Department, releasing its annual balance sheet on
the nation's global economic standing Thursday, said the U.S. debt
burden had risen by $154.2 billion in 1988, up from $378.3 billion
in debt to foreigners the United States owed at the end of 1987.

   A court-appointed bankruptcy examiner says the
only alternatives for strikebound Eastern Airlines are a reduction
in its size or liquidation.
   David I. Shapiro told a crowded congressional hearing Thursday
that a plan by a Chicago businessman to take over the airline in
partnership with Eastern's unions and with temporary management by
former Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci is not viable.
   Carlucci and businessman Joseph Ritchie, however, told the House
Public Works and Transportation aviation subcommittee that their
plan offered the only hope for restoring Eastern as a major airline.

   Corporate raider Paul A. Bilzerian _ convicted
earlier this month of securities crimes _ and billionaire Edward J.
DeBartolo Sr. have been charged in a civil securities fraud lawsuit
seeking more than $34 million in penalties.
   In the complaint filed Thursday in Washington, the Securities and
Exchange Commission charged Bilzerian, DeBartolo and three others
with concealing investments to mask planned takeovers, manipulating
stock prices or trading on inside information in seven deals from
1985 through 1988.
   DeBartolo, 70, a Youngstown, Ohio, shopping mall developer who

associates agreed to settle the charges against without admitting or
denying guilt. But Bilzerian, and an attorney for one of his trusts,

   The Conference Board, a business research organization, said its

   The index tracks the volume of classified advertising in 51 major

<HEAD>U.S. Textile Imports Down for First Time in 1980s</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the first time in the 1980s the United
States last year cut its imports of cloth and clothing, some of the
major manufactured items that Third World countries sell to rich
ones, the U.S. International Trade Commission reported.
   The drop was 6 percent, to the equivalent of 12.9 billion square
yards of fabric, the commission said Thursday.
   Increases between 1980 and 1987 averaged 14 percent a year.
   The drop was smaller in dollar terms, a decline of less than 1
percent to $23.4 billion.
   Much of the decrease came in U.S. buying from its four major
suppliers: Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan and China, which provided
41 percent of the quantity. Their yardage was down by 11 percent.
   Imports from the 12 countries of the European Economic Community
also dropped but those from Japan increased, as did shipments from
the Caribbean.
   Clothing imports declined by only 1 percent and remained the
largest segment. The report covers trade under the Multifiber
Arrangement, an international system that limits imports and covers
almost the whole field of cloth and clothing.
   Cotton products accounted for much of the decrease, dropping by
10 percent. Products made of silk blends, linen and ramie showed
sharper declines but account for much less of the total.

<HEAD>FDA Will Ban Methylene Chloride From Cosmetic Sprays</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration says it plans
to ban the use of methylene chloride, a suspected carcinogen, in
hair spray and other aerosol cosmetic products.
   The ban is based on studies showing that when inhaled, methylene
chloride can cause lung and liver tumors in laboratory mice, said
FDA spokesman William Grigg.
   Rules for the ban were published in Thursday's Federal Register
and were to take effect in 60 days.
   Most hair spray manufacturers have stopped using methylene
chloride as a fire retardant and drying agent since the FDA proposed
the ban in December 1985. A recent FDA survey of Washington-area
stores found only one brand containing the substance, Grigg said.
   Methylene chloride also is used to remove caffeine from coffee,
but the FDA said it had no immediate plans to ban this use because
studies show the cancer risk comes from inhaling the substance
rather than drinking it.

<HEAD>Miller To Test Low-Calorie Version Of Genuine Draft</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Miller Brewing Co. says it will try to
capitalize on the success of its Genuine Draft brand by test
marketing a low-calorie version of the beer.
   Starting in July, Miller Genuine Draft Light will be test
marketed in Louisville, Ky., plus selected cities in California,
Ohio and Wisconsin.
   ``Since Genuine Draft has been such a success, it's only natural
to bring out a low-calorie brand,'' Kevin Tripp, draft light brand
manager, said Thursday.
   Miller, the nation's No. 2 brewer behind Anheuser-Busch Inc.,
introduced Genuine Draft in 1986, and the beer is among the fastest
growing brands in the country.
   Meanwhile, light beers have been one of the biggest growing
segments in a stagnant overall market.
   Jerry Steinman, publisher of Beer Marketer's Insights, an
industry newsletter, said Miller is trying to combine the success of
Genuine Draft with the growth of the low-calorie market.
   ``It's certainly a wise move,'' he said.
   Analysts warn that Genuine Draft Light may eat away sales both
from Genuine Draft and from Miller Lite, the top selling low-calorie
beer in the country. But they add Miller would only undertake such a
venture if the company believed it could boost overall sales.
   ``That's always a risk, that it will cannibalize another brand,''
said John Collopy, who stuies the beer industry and is president of
the Milwaukee investment firm of Cleary Gull Reiland McDevitt &amp;
Collopy Inc. ``But they obviously have confidence it will work.''
   While Miller Lite is by far the top-selling low-calorie beer in
the country, and the No. 2 brand overall, it has been facing an
increased threat from Bud Light and Coors Light, which rank as the
No. 3 and 4 brands in the country respectively.
   ``What we are saying is the category is growing, so it makes
sense to have more than one brand,'' Tripp said.

<HEAD>Burger King Stays With Pepsi Generation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Burger King Corp. says it will remain in the Pepsi
generation after reviewing its soft drink vendor agreement and
considering an offer to switch domestic business to Coca Cola.
   ``After an exhaustive review of proposals from both Pepsi Cola
Co. and Coca Cola USA, we've decided to continue our relationship
with Pepsi,'' said Barry J. Gibbons, chief executive officer of
Burger King Corp.
   ``This was not an easy choice to make,'' Gibbons said Thursday.
``Both suppliers presented excellent proposals.''
   Burger King International will continue its current agreement
with Coca Cola Co. to provide soft drink services. Burger King has
5,200 restaurants in the United States and 600 internationally.
   ``Both are strong brands and the decision was very, very close,''
said Cori Zywotow, spokeswoman for Miami-based Burger King, the
world's second-biggest fast food chain after McDonald's. ``Burger
King is the largest domestic fountain account for Pepsi.''
   The decision was based on a number of considerations _
operations, marketing, franchise agreements and servicing, she said.
   ``We have up to 9 million people per day coming to our
restaurants in the United States and most are buying soft drinks,''
she said, while declining to estimate the value of the contract.
   The company initiated the vendor review in early June. The
contract with Pepsi is open-ended with a 60-day clause for
cancellation, Ms. Zywotow said.
   Pepsi has held the account since 1983, the year Coca-Cola lost it.
   Tod MacKenzie, a spokesman at Pepsi Cola Co. headquarters in
Somers, N.Y., said the Burger King decision was ``a validation of
Pepsi's relation with Burger King.''
   MacKenzie said Burger King sales accounted for 3 percent of
Pepsi's total soft-drink volume and 14.5 percent of its fountain
volume last year.
   ``Burger King asked us to make a proposal for their U.S.
agreement,'' said Coca Cola spokesman Carlton Curtis. ``We were
pleased to do so, and their decision has been made.''
   ``The Coca Cola Co. is privileged to be the soft drink supplier
to the vast majority of the food service industry. We offer our
customers the world's most admired and recognized trademark and the
very highest quality products, service and equipment,'' Curtis said.
   The soft drink review came under new corporate ownership of
Pillsbury Co. and the new management team at Burger King.
   Pillsbury, Burger King's parent, was bought by Britain's Grand
Metropolitan PLC last winter.

<TEXT>
   Nine U.S. computer companies say they are forming
a lobbying group to work on policies ``aimed at ensuring the
long-term competitiveness of U.S. systems makers.''
   The founding members of the Computer Systems Policy Project are
Apple Computer Inc., Compaq Computer Corp., Cray Research Inc.,
Hewlett-Packard Co., International Business Machines Corp., NCR
Corp., Sun Microsystems Inc., Tandem Computers Inc. and Unisys Corp.
   The Washington-based group's agenda overlaps with _ but sometimes
differs from _ the priorities of existing groups such as the
American Electronics Association, the Semiconductor Industry
Association and the Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers
Association.
   ``It's not to replace those nor to rival them in size or
magnitude. It's rather an ad hoc group that will exist for an
indeterminate period of time,'' Tim Sheehy, an IBM spokesman in
Washington, said Thursday.
   Among other issues, Sheehy said the group would favor allowing
the U.S.-Japan semiconductor trade agreement to expire on schedule
in 1991. The agreement is intended to prevent dumping of chips by
Japan and open Japan's home market to foreign-made chips.
   Japan is already complying with the prohibition on dumping and
the group expects it will comply with the market-opening provision
by 1991, Sheehy said. The Semiconductor Industry Association is more
skeptical about Japan's compliance, Andrew Procassini, the SIA
president, said in an interview.
   Additional U.S.-owned computer makers may join the new
organization in the future, Sheehy said. Digital Equipment Corp. is
the biggest computer maker not among the founders. Digital spokesman
Joseph Codispoti said he could not immediately comment on the
company's plans.
   Sheehy said the organization is seeking a director.

<HEAD>News Corp. Sells Book Publishers; Raises $2.2 Billion To Pay Off
Debts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. Ltd. says it had
raised $2.2 billion for paying off debts by selling publishing
properties, including $1.3 billion from the sale of book publishers
to a newly formed company it jointly owns.
   The sales, announced Thursday, are an interim step in News
Corp.'s previously announced plan to form a new company for buying
and developing media and communications properties worldwide. News
Corp. plans to manage that company and own at least 20 percent of it.
   News Corp. said it raised more than $1.3 billion in cash and
stock by selling several book publishers, including Harper &amp; Row, to
a new company owned half by News Corp. and half by entities related
to CS First Boston Inc., an investment house.
   It raised another $825 million by completing the previously
announced sale of eight travel business publications and an
electronic travel and information service to Reed International PLC.
   News Corp.'s ability to expand has been restricted by the heavy
debts it incurred in a series of ambitious acquisitions, including
the $2.85 billion acquisition last year of Triangle Publications
Inc., publisher of TV Guide and other magazines.
   In other steps to reduce its debts the company recently sold the
Fox Plaza building in Los Angeles and its interests in the U.S. and
British editions of Elle magazine.
   The newly formed News Corp.-First Boston company bought book
publishing operations consisting of Harper &amp; Row, William Collins
PLC, and other publishers in Britain, Australia and New Zealand. The
transaction was partly financed with $1 billion in loans from a
banking group led by Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.
   News Corp. and CS First Boston intend to bring in additional
investors and create a new company that will own those book
publishing operations and buy other media and communications
properties.
   News Corp. bought William Collins for about $693 million in
January and Harper and Row for $300 million in 1987.
   News Corp.'s other major holdings include the Boston Herald
newspaper, Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp., Fox Broadcasting, seven
U.S. television stations, The Times of London and New York magazine.

   Here is a summary of alleged deals cited by the
Securities and Exchange Commission in its lawsuit against investor
Paul A. Bilzerian, developer Edward J. DeBartolo Sr. and three
others filed Thursday in federal court in Washington:
   _Singer Co: The suit alleges Bilzerian borrowed at least $8
million from two unidentified investors to buy stock in Singer,
which Bilzerian acquired for $1.06 billion in early 1988, but
misrepresented the funds as his own in federal disclosure forms.
   It also says Bilzerian failed to disclose the arrangements under
which he borrowed another $6 million for the deal. He borrowed it on
the condition the lender would receive a fixed rate of interest plus
profits from the sale of Singer stock.
   _Pay 'N Pak Stores Inc.: Bilzerian is charged with
misrepresenting on federal disclosure forms the source of $3.75
million used to buy company stock.
   _Fortune Financial Group Inc.: Bilzerian allegedly accumulated
55,000 shares of stock last year during a period when he was
supposed to have disclosed his 5 percent stake in the company, then
sold the shares at a profit when the stock rose $4 a share the day
he declared his holdings.
   _Cluett, Peabody &amp; Co.: Bilzerian allegedly misreprented on
disclosure forms the source of $8.75 million used to buy Cluett
stock in 1985 as personal funds when they actually had been obtained
from various investors, including DeBartolo.
   He also is charged with failing to disclose deals with the
investors to split profits on the stock.
   Bilzerian allegedly filed late a disclosure form declaring a more
than 5 percent interest in a company. He is charged with having had
an illegal stock ``parking'' arrangement with broker Boyd L.
Jefferies.
   After the filing, Bilzerian allegedly entered into an undisclosed
group arrangement with DeBartolo and two associates and borrowed but
did not report another $2 million to pay tender expenses in a
takeover bid for Cluett.
   Finally, he was charged with deliberately misrepresenting that he
intended to acquire an controlling interest in Cluett when he
actually planned to force the company to a friendly suitor or obtain
``greenmail.''
   DeBartolo and associate William D. Moses are charged with helping
Bilzerian conceal the true source of his funds and terms of
borrowing. The suit also claims they bought stock knowing about the
misrepresentations on the filing.
   _Hammermill Paper Co.: As in Cluett, the complaint contends
Bilzerian misrepresented the source of funds, including $8 million
from DeBartolo, used in an attempted takeover.
   He is charged with making more than $31 million when he acquired
more than 2 million shares of Hammermill in 1986 in a secret parking
arrangement with Jefferies and with filing a disclosure form with
the SEC 18 days later than required.
   Bilzerian also allegedly manipulated the stock price of
Hammermill in May 1986 by selling 350,000 shares to drive down the
price before he tried to buy a substantial block of Hammermill stock
from another investor.
   California lawyer David A. Tallant is charged with aiding the
scheme to conceal the true source of funds to acquire the Hammermill
stock. DeBartolo is charged with aiding Bilzerian in concealing the
source of his $8 million loan.
   Moses is charged with insider trading for allegedly buying 10,000
Hammermill shares in 1986 using non-public information concerning
Bilzerian's planned tender offer.
   _H.H. Robertson Co. and Armco Inc.: Bilzerian allegedly entered
into a secret stock parking arrangement with Jefferies to create
bogus tax losses in 1985 and 1986.

<HEAD>Eastern, Creditors Ask for Extension of Exclusive Plan Period</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Eastern-Bankruptcy, Bjt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines and its major creditors,
indicating they were nearing agreement on a reorganization plan for
the strikebound company, have asked a federal bankruptcy judge to
extend Eastern's exclusive right to submit such a plan, the parties
said.
   The joint request to extend the period for two weeks through July
21 was made because the parties have made ``good progress'' in
negotiations and believe the extra time will bring them closer to a
final plan, Joel Zweibel, the attorney representing Eastern's major
creditors, said Thursday.
   A company that seeks Chapter 11 federal bankruptcy protection
from creditors has the sole right to submit a reorganization plan to
the court during the first 120 days of its case, after which other
parties may propose plans.
   Eastern wants to rebuild as a smaller carrier and pay off debts
with the proceeds of some $1.8 billion in asset sales, including
several that already have been approved by the bankruptcy court.
   The reorganization plan also addresses how creditors and
shareholders would be treated.
   The joint request could signal another setback for a buyout
proposal for Miami-based Eastern led by the airline's striking
unions and Chicago commodities trader Joseph Ritchie.
   Ritchie, the president of Chicago Research &amp; Trading Group,
presented to a congressional subcommittee Thursday a competing plan
_ already submitted to Eastern's creditors _ that he said could
restore the airline as ``a major competitor in the airline
industry.''
   Eastern filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors on March
9, five days after it was hit by a Machinists union strike that was
joined by pilots and flight attendants.
   On Tuesday, Eastern and the creditors group asked U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge Burton R. Lifland to extend the exclusivity period due to end
July 7. Lifland scheduled a July 5 hearing on the extension request
and other issues in the case.
   Eastern's three unions are represented on the creditors committee.
   Dan Ashby, a spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association, said,
``The company is unable to come up with a viable business plan and
they're stalling for time.''
   Zweibel declined to speculate on the prospects for Lifland
granting a two-week extension. However, he said that in most large
bankruptcy cases much longer extensions usually are requested and
granted.
   ``One would think that in a case of this size and complexity ...
it is quite typical to grant an initial extension,'' he said.
   Eastern and the creditors' committee ``believe that meaningful
progress is being made in the negotiation of a consensual plan of
reorganization _ a plan that will provide for the payment in full,
with interest, of all allowed claims,'' the document filed with the
court states.
   It requests the extension ``in order to provide the time to bring
negotiations hopefully closer to fruition, and then to draft a
consensual plan.'' The extra time would allow Eastern and the
creditors to resolve unspecified issues, the document says.

short-term debt should help lift the company out of an
``embarrassing situation.''
   Integrated announced a plan Thursday to refinance all short-term
debt the real estate and investment firm defaulted on earlier this
month. The plan includes $300 million in mortgage notes to be issued
by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and a debt-swap program.
   ``This is truly an embarrassing situation for us,'' Integrated
President Arthur Goldberg said in a statement at the annual
shareholders meeting Thursday. ``We are doing everything we can to
get this company back on its feet.''
   The plan apparently requires full approval by all Integrated's
bankers and commercial paper holders, said Tony Fisher, assistant
vice president of Moody's Investors Service Inc.
   ``That may be difficult to obtain,'' he said.
   ``Basically this is a preliminary step to try and resolve the
situation in a way which gives the debt holders partial payment now
and asks them to wait a little longer for further payment,'' he
added.
   Integrated said it would use 90 percent of the proceeds from new
senior mortgage notes issued by Drexel to pay off a portion of the
outstanding short-term debt the struggling firm defaulted on earlier
this month.
   Integrated, which sells insurance policies, mutual funds and real
estate limited partnerships, said the remaining $655 million in
short-term debt would be exchanged for a variety of lower-quality
securities.
   Integrated's 50 banks withdrew access to short-term credit
markets amid signs of weakening financial condition at the firm,
which has $1.1 billion in capital, $7.8 billion in assets and a
sales force of 4,600.
   ``Our principal objective is to bring stability back to the
company as quickly as possible,'' Goldberg said. ``To do this we
need a real plan which debt-holders can agree to quickly. We believe
this plan accomplishes that objective.''
   ``It will restore stability and avoid other more dire
consequences,'' he added.
   Drexel said it would itself buy a third of the $300 million in
new first-mortgage notes, which would be secured by a first lien on
all the company's assets. It said it was highly confident it could
sell the remaining $200 million to other investors.
   The rest of the short-term debt would be exchanged for a variety
of lower-quality securities, including junior notes that would pay
interest in the form of more notes. The company said a breakdown of
the securities had not been determined.
   Some debt also would be exchanged for stock, doubling or tripling
the number of Integrated's common shares, Goldberg said. That would
dilute the value of existing stock.
   The new notes would be for a term of three years, Integrated
said, while the exchange offers would begin in a few weeks.
   The company also announced thta it is suspending dividend
payments on its preferred stock.
   Integrated common stock, which has plunged from more than $16 a
share a month ago, fell another 25 cents to $4.25 in New York Stock
Exchange trading Thursday. But its debt securities rose. A 13[
percent note due in 1995 rose $2 to $30.50 in NYSE trading.
   Goldberg said the company plans to sell a number of assets,
including its interest in tax-sheltered annuities, a block of
ordinary life insurance policies and its interest in American Real
Estate Partners, a limited partnership.
   Among Integrated's short-term debt obligations when it defaulted
were $373 million in commercial paper and loan shares due within 45
days. The debt payments amounted to about $8 million a day.
   The company's problems do not affect any of its 35 subsidiaries,
which have about 750,000 investor accounts. Among its subsidiaries
are Integrated Resources Life Insurance Co. of Des Moines, Iowa, and
Capitol Life Insurance Co. of Denver.

<HEAD>New Texas Bank Expected To Improve Competition For Consumer Business</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bank One Texas will start life next week with a
clean balance sheet, $500 million in new capital and expectations
that Texas consumers will benefit from a new player in the state.
   Bank One will be created from the remnants of the 20 failed
subsidiary banks of MCorp, a troubled Dallas bank holding company.
Banc One Corp. of Columbus, Ohio, was selected late Wednesday by
government regulators to buy the 20 banks and plans to rename them
Bank One Texas.
   Banc One was selected over several other bidders, including some
Texas banks that analysts had predicted had the inside track to the
state's third largest bank holding company.
   But after Banc One was chosen, some of the same analysts praised
the decision, crediting its reputation for innovation in the
consumer banking market and strong equity with overcoming the
in-state banks' perceived advantages.
   Investors, apparently, also were pleased. Banc One stock was the
most actively traded issue Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange,
jumping $5 to $33 a share from Wednesday's close.
   The deal is expected to be the second-largest bank bailout in
history, costing the government about $2 billion. The biggest was
last year's government rescue of another Texas bank, First
RepublicBank Corp., which regulators say may end up costing $3
billion.
   Banc One is contributing $500 million to the deal in a complex
arrangement that will permit it to exclude the Texas operation from
its consolidated balance sheet and maintain its record as one of the
nation's five most profitable banks.
   Although it initially will own only 7.5 percent of the Texas
bank, Banc One is committed to buy 100 percent by the end of five
years.
   Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman L. William Seidman said
$2 billion was the agency's ``best estimate'' of the bailout cost,
but cautioned that it could end up being $200 million to $300
million too high or too low. Most of the money will go toward
covering losses on the failed banks' $3 billion to $3.5 billion in
sour commercial real estate loans.
   However, Banc One Chairman John B. McCoy told reporters Thursday
in Dallas that the amount of bad loans could reach $5 billion.
   McCoy said Banc One immediately will begin putting its credit
card expertise to work, mailing credit card applications to all Bank
One Texas customers.
   ``We think that our skill is as a retail bank and we're not sure
there has been a great retail bank in Texas,'' McCoy said.
   ``It is the middle market, the retail lending, that gives you the
margin, gives you the growth,'' McCoy said, predicting that with a
little luck Bank One Texas would double in size to $20 billion in
assets in five years.
   Bank One Texas, which will take over Wednesday, will have 65
branches covering most of the state's major markets and about $13
billion in assets, although McCoy said that could drop to about $10
billion after bad assets are pruned.
   Banc One has $25.3 billion in assets and also owns banks in Ohio,
Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan and Wisconsin. It has been a
leader in automated and computerized banking and has aggressively
promoted consumer services such as credit cards, auto loans and
student loans.
   ``I think it's an excellent choice in terms of strengthening
competition in the Texas markets,'' said industry consultant Alex
Sheshunoff in Austin.
   ``For Banc One it makes a tremendous amount of sense because the
best part of the Texas market is the consumer market. Consumers are
still buying refrigerators, cars and making bank deposits,'' he said.
   ``The net result is Texas will now become the Beirut of banking
with West Coast, New York, Midwest and North Carolina banks trying
out their most innovative techniques in Texas.''
   Besides Banc One, New York's Chemical Banking Corp., NCNB Corp.
of Charlotte, N.C., and Los Angeles' First Interstate Bancorp. have
come to the rescue of some of Texas' largest banks.
   Since the rebuilding of Texas' shattered banking industry began
about two years ago, seven of the state's 10 largest bank holding
companies have been recapitalized with outside money. Bids for two
of the remaining three are currently being reviewed by the FDIC.
   The selection of Banc One was seen as an attempt to correct one
of Texas' underlaying bank weaknesses.
   ``There has been virtually no consumer banking until the last
year or so,'' said PaineWebber Inc. analyst Sandra Flannigan in
Houston. ``The Texas banks didn't have to concern themselves because
the commercial side was so profitable.''
   But the failures of the energy industry, and subsequent real
estate weakness, erased that profitability.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar was mostly lower in quiet trading
early today, although well above the levels it reached the day
before following a round of interest rate hikes by European central
banks.
   Gold prices were mostly lower.
   At midmorning, the dollar was quoted at 1.9505 West German marks
in London, up from 1.9430 marks late Thursday but below the late
price of 1.9640 Thursday in New York.
   Dealers said the dollar recovered most of the ground it lost
following the decision by the Bundesbank and central banks of
France, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark and Austria
to raise key interest rates.
   Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 143.95 Japanese yen, up
1.05 yen from Thursday. Later in London, the dollar traded at 143.73
yen.
   Dealers said the yen had been weakened by the controversy
surround Prime Minister Sousuke Uno, who has been accused of paying
a geisha girl to be his mistress.
   ``The yen is likely to remain weak at least through next week,''
said Takahiko Takemoto, a dealer at Citibank in Tokyo.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.5513 today, cheaper for
buyers than Thursday's late $1.5650.
   Other late rates for the dollar in Europe, compared with late
Thursday's prices, included: 1.6690 Swiss francs, up from 1.6650;
6.6230 French francs, up from 6.5925; 2.2024 Dutch guilders, up from
2.1875; 1,414.00 Italian lire, from 1,407.00; and 1.1953 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.1950.
   Gold opened in London at $371 a troy ounce, down from Thursday's
late bid of $375.25. At midmorning, the city's five major bullion
dealers fixed a recommended price of $371.15.
   In Zurich, gold was quoted at $371.25, down from $376 late
Thursday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at $372.05, down from $376.45.
   Silver bullion traded in London at $5.17 a troy ounce, down from
$5.28.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar closed higher today against the
Japanese yen while prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange ended slightly
lower.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which shed
289.29 points the previous day, lost another 7.62 points or 0.02
percent, falling to 32,948.69 points. Volume was very light at 430
million shares traded.
   The dollar closed at 143.95 yen, up 1.05 yen from Thursday's
close. It ranged from 143.70 yen to 144.45 yen.
   Political problems stemming from a sex scandal involving Prime
Minister Sousuke Uno helped weaken the yen, dealers said.
End-of-the-month buying of dollars for transactions by importers
also helped push up the dollar.
   Uno was hit with allegations in a widening sex scandal this week,
and traders expect the yen may fall further if the scandal-plagued
ruling party does badly in Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly elections
Sunday.
   ``The yen is likely to remain weak at least through next week,''
said Takahiko Takemoto, a dealer at Citibank.
   Some traders expect the yen to remain weak through the upper
house elections scheduled for July 23.
   On the stock exchange, dealers said political uncertainty led to
very light trading.
   ``The Uno scandal affected the currency market first and will
have a continuing impact on the stock market. The main factors that
led the market down were worries about the local assembly election
Sunday,'' said Tatsuhiko Takahashi, general manager at Kleinwort
Benson International.
   He said a rumor that Uno would not attend the Paris summit of
industrial nations in July hurt the market for a time, although Uno
later denied the rumor and said he would attend.
   The market dropped by 300 points by the early afternoon but
recovered as bargain-hunters began buying and index trading by
institutional investors stepped in, traders said.

<HEAD>Air Midwest Rejects Buyout Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The board of Air Midwest Inc. rejected a
St. Louis company's $31.1 million offer to buy the commuter airline.
   The board said Thursday the $8-a-share offer by Resort Air Inc.
was inadequate, according to Air Midwest Chairman Robert L. Priddy.
   Air Midwest, which feeds Braniff at Kansas City International
Airport, has asked Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. Inc. to act as its adviser
in determining an appropriate price for the airline, Priddy said.
   Air Midwest has the largest commuter operation at KCI. Air
Midwest and Resort Air both feed Trans World Airlines at Lambert-St.
Louis International Airport.
   Analysts said the rejection was expected and that Resort Air
probably would come back with another friendly offer.
   ``There has to be a meeting of the minds on the price,'' said
Samuel Buttrick, an airline analyst in Memphis, Tenn. ``If you read
between the lines of Air Midwest's press release, you get the
impression that they would seriously consider a higher offer.''
   Analysts expect Air Midwest to have a profitable second quarter,
which they said should continue increasing the company's value. Air
Midwest's stock was unchanged at $7.87{ Thursday in over-the-counter
trading.
   ``I think the board of directors was looking at where the stock
price would be a month from now in rejecting the offer,'' said
Daniel Hersh, an airline analyst in Los Angeles.
   Hersh said there did not appear to be any other potential buyers
for Air Midwest.
   Buttrick said he expected Air Midwest to earn about $1.4 million
for the three months that will end today. Buttrick also said he
expected a final offer of $11 to $12 a share.
   Resort Air, owned by businessman Hulas Kanodia, is smaller than
Air Midwest.
   Air Midwest said last week an agreement depended upon the ability
of Resort Air to arrange financing. Resort Air is thought to be
backed by the Bankers Trust New York Corp.

   Chrysler Corp. said slumping sales of
small cars have forced the layoff of 400 workers at its Sterling
Heights assembly plant.
   The layoffs take effect July 7 when the plant, where Dodge
Shadows and Plymouths Sundances are assembled, closes for model
changeover.
   When production resumes in late July, only 2,900 of the plant's
3,300 workers will return, Chrysler spokesman Doug Nicoll said
Thursday. Daily production of the Shadows and Sundances will drop
from 958 to 818.
   Sales of the Shadow fell from 44,000 in the first five months of
1988 to 37,700 during the same period this year. Sundance sales
dropped from 39,000 to 38,000 over the same period.
   The layoffs may be due to increased auto production in Mexico,
said United Auto workers Local 1700 President Melvin Caldwell.
   ``They assembled 39,674 P-cars (Sundances and Shadows) in Mexico
last year,'' he said. ``It's hard to believe those are all for the
Mexican market.''
   Nicoll denied the Mexican compacts are sold in the United States.
   Earlier this year, Chrysler laid off 1,600 workers at its
Jefferson Avenue assembly plant in Detroit.

<HEAD>Wasserstein Perella Raises Bid For Gateway</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group headed by Wasserstein Perella &amp; Co. on
Friday raised its bid for the British foodstore chain Gateway Corp.
PLC by $71 million in an effort to defeat an offer from rival
Isosceles PLC.
   The aggressive New York investment firm and its partner, the
Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co., is now offering $3.75 a share, up
from $3.67 a share.
   Based on Gateway's roughly 890 million shares outstanding, the
new offer is worth about $3.34 billion. The bidders, operating under
the name Newgateway, said this was their final offer.
   While the bid exceeds the $3.56-a-share cash portion of the
Isosceles' offer, it falls short of what Isosceles' advisers claim
their cash-and-stock bid is worth under a revised valuation of the
offer's equity component. Salomon Brothers International put the
value at between $3.79 and $3.87 a share.
   Investor skepticism over the Salomon valuation was reflected in
the marketplace. Gateway shares moved only narrowly around $3.67,
the previous level of the Newgateway offer.
   Isosceles, which opened the bidding for Gateway in April,
disclosed Friday that the number of Gateway shares it controls has
slipped to 44.0 percent from the 44.8 percent it claimed at the end
of last week.
   The decline appears to be the result of withdrawals from
shareholders who at one time had signalled their intention of
accepting the offer. S.G. Warburg &amp; Co., an adviser to Isosceles,
said holders of 13.58 million common shares, or about 1.52 percent,
had withdrawn their acceptances.

   The stock market declined broadly today in
selling blamed on spreading recession worries.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 73.60 points in the
week's first four sessions, dropped another 22.76 to 2,435.51 in the
first half hour of trading today.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 2 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 248 up, 633 down and
535 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 31.23 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The market has been under pressure since the government reported
Wednesday that the index of leading economic indicators posted a
larger-than-expected 1.2 percent decline in May.
   More evidence of a dropoff in business activity came this morning
with the news of a 2.5 percent drop in new factory orders in the
same month.
   Until recently, Wall Street has been welcoming news of slower
growth in hopes of a ``soft landing'' that would allow for reduced
inflation and lower interest rates without much harm to corporate
profits.
   But in the past few days, analysts say, investors have begun to
look more closely at the possibility that the Federal Reserve might
not be able to pull off that tricky mission.
   As evidence, they noted that stocks in the past couple of days
have not responded favorably to continuing declines in open-market
money rates.
   Losers among the blue chips included Philip Morris, down 1 at
139; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, down \ at 35\; General
Electric, down ] at 52, and International Business Machines, down {
at 111.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
1.98 to 176.77. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 1.99 at 358.62.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 46.47 points
to 2,458.27, for its biggest drop since it lost 48.57 points on
March 17.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 1 on the
NYSE, with 263 up, 1,317 down and 388 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 167.10 million shares, against 158.47
million in the previous session.

   Strike-bound Eastern Airlines must either
restructure itself as a smaller carrier as its management plans or
liquidate, says a court-appointed bankruptcy examiner.
   The examiner, David I. Shapiro, told a congressional hearing
Thursday that a union-backed takeover plan to restore the airline to
full operations with former Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci as
interim head is not viable.
   Eastern owner Frank Lorenzo and the court previously rejected the
plan, but the House Public Works and Transportation aviation
subcommittee gave it another airing in the committee's effort to
find a way to restore Eastern as a major carrier.
   Carlucci told the panel that turning the airline over to Chicago
businessman Joseph Ritchie and Eastern unions is the only way to
save the airline as a major carrier. Ritchie had asked Carlucci to
temporarily head the airline if the sale is approved.
   At the same hearing, Eastern reiterated plans to resume more of
its flights this Sunday and work up to 50 percent of its pre-strike
schedule by August. The airline has been operating only a few
flights since March when a Machinists strike, supported by pilots
and flight attendants, led it to file for reorganization under
federal bankruptcy laws.
   Shapiro, who represents and advises the federal bankruptcy court
in New York, told the subcommittee that major Eastern assets must be
sold to ``reduce the enormous interest burden on the company.''
   The airline has debts totalling $3.6 billion.
   ``These past months have left me with the reluctant but firm
conviction that only two practical alternative remain in this
case,'' said Shapiro. ``The first is a reorganization plan premised
on a smaller Eastern Airlines; the second is liquidation.''
   Shapiro said Ritchie's plan included no firm offer to Lorenzo's
Texas Air in payment for the airline and had no operational plan
that would keep the airline flying. He said Ritchie had failed in a
dozen meetings with court officials to provide a confidential letter
showing he had financial backing for his plan.
   ``Ritchie's plan flunked in operational viability and it flunked
in financial viability and is still flunking,'' Shapiro said.
   Shapiro said he still sees a ``ray of hope'' in talks he is
holding with striking unions, trying to convince them to accept a
scaled-down airline and return to work.
   The unions, however, repeated that they will not work for
Lorenzo, head of Texas Air, which owns Eastern and nonunion
Continental Airlines.
   Henry Duffy, president of the Air Line Pilots Association, said
Lorenzo was maneuvering to sell off Eastern's assets and close it
down. Eastern claims assets of $6 billion, but potential purchasers
say it's worth a couple of billion dollars less.
   Phil Bakes, Eastern president, said the airline's training of
pilots and preparations to increase flights show Lorenzo does not
plan to sell off any more than the $1.8 billion in assets previously
announced.
   He said Eastern is losing $1.7 million a day because of the
strike but plans to build itself up to 70 percent of its previous
level.
   Carlucci, defense secretary in the latter part of the Reagan
administration, told the panel he is still willing to act as an
interim chief executive of the airline if Ritchie's offer is
accepted.
   ``This approach is the only one that has a chance of restoring
Eastern to its once proud status,'' he said.
   Ritchie, president of Chicago Research &amp; Trading Group, said his
plan calls for $100 million in new money from his own funds, the
unions and other investors and $200 million or more in new financing.

   Cyclops will continue to produce flat-rolled, stainless and
carbon steel and tubular products. It also makes and erects metal
panels and curtain walls for non-residential buildings.
   The division is the largest of five operations Cyclops put on the
auction block under a restructuring that began in 1987. Two others
have been sold, while a carbon steel strip operation in Detroit and
a flexible metal tubing operation in Costa Mesa, Calif., are up for
sale.

   Eleven Sears, Roebuck and Co. stores in the Chicago region have
been operating such centers on a test basis since last October.
Morison said these have been popular with customers.
   The Sears offices drew criticism from the American Postal Workers
Union because they were staffed by Sears employees rather than
postal workers.
   Morison said the facilities are no threat to the jobs of postal
workers, that additional revenue generated by them helps create more
delivery and mail-processing jobs.
   The Sears operations will be phased out with the introduction of
the new facilities in shopping malls, but those will still be
contract offices, not staffed by postal workers, said Postal Service
spokesman Ralph Stewart.
   Individual Sears stores will be eligible to bid for the new
facilities along with other mall stores.

   The stock market dropped sharply again today in
selling blamed on spreading recession worries.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 73.60 points in the
week's first four sessions, fell another 33.00 to 2,425.27 by 11
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 1 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 202 up, 1,094 down
and 431 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 64.36 million shares at
midmorning.
   The market has been under pressure since the government reported
Wednesday that the index of leading economic indicators posted a
larger-than-expected 1.2 percent decline in May.
   More evidence of a dropoff in business activity came this morning
with the news of a 2.5 percent drop in new factory orders in the
same month.
   Until recently, Wall Street has been welcoming news of slower
growth in hopes of a ``soft landing'' that would allow for reduced
inflation and lower interest rates without much harm to corporate
profits.
   But in the past few days, analysts say, investors have begun to
look more closely at the possibility that the Federal Reserve might
not be able to pull off that tricky mission.
   As evidence, they noted that stocks in the past couple of days
have not responded favorably to continuing declines in open-market
money rates.
   Losers among the blue chips included Philip Morris, down 2] at
137|; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, down | at 34~; General
Electric, down { at 51~, and International Business Machines, down

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
2.09 to 176.66. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 2.99 at 357.62.

   The Seabrook nuclear plant's No. 2
executive has been fired one week after low-power testing was
abruptly suspended because of improper control room procedures, a
spokesman said today.
   George Thomas, a vice president in charge of nuclear production
at the $6 billion reactor, was relieved of all plant duties on
Thursday because of ``inappropriate management actions'' after the
June 22 reactor shutdown, plant spokesman Ron Sher said.
   He would not specify what actions by Thomas led to the firing,
saying only that Thomas was in the control room as an observer at
the time of the shutdown, and that the problem with Thomas came
after the shutdown, not before.
   ``It is premature to discuss just why he has been relieved,''
Sher said.
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the state attorney general and
the plant are investigating what occurred after control room workers
learned of a valve malfunction that forced the shutdown after nine
days of testing.
   After he was fired from the Seabrook-related position, Thomas
resigned from his position as a vice president with Public Service
Company of New Hampshire, the chief owner of the plant.
   Details of Thomas' departure will be in a report to the NRC,
which the plant has said will be submitted to the commission by
early July.
   The utility has acknowledged that Seabrook control room operators
did not follow proper procedures after a faulty valve in the
non-nuclear side of the plant caused a malfunction in pressure
during low-power testing.
   NRC officials have said it took inspectors five minutes and
discussions with at least three people to persuade them to shut down
the reactor.
   Thomas, reached at his home this morning, said he had no comment.

   After numerous rumors about a possible takeover
of Steinberg Inc., Oxdon Investments Inc. has come forward with
another bid for the Canadian grocery giant.
   Oxdon, a consortium led by Unicorp Canada Corp. of Toronto,
Thursday announced it is making an offer worth about $1.29 billion
(Canadian) for all outstanding common and class A shares of the
retailing company.
   Based on current exchange rates, the value of the offer is about
$1.08 billion (U.S.).
   Oxdon previously has attempted to get control of Steinberg. Two
proposals made earlier this year were lower than the latest one.
   Only two days ago, a spokesman for Unicorp dismissed talk of a
renewed effort by Oxdon to acquire Steinberg as ``wild rumors.''
   Trading in Steinberg shares on the Toronto and Montreal exchanges
has been halted since Tuesday when exchange officials said they
became ``aware of a situation that could have a material impact'' on
the shares.
   Under Oxdon's new proposal, detailed in a statement, Steinberg
would become a real estate concern and its retail and wholesale
businesses would be put up for sale.
   Holders of Steinberg common shares are being offered a choice of
$75 cash (Canadian) or 1.5 Oxdon restricted voting shares for each
common share. And class A shareholders are being offered a choice of
$50 cash (Canadian) or one Oxdon restricted voting share for each
class A share.
   Steinberg has been considered a likely takeover target since 1988
when a family dispute prompted the board of directors to seek offers
for the company.
   Oxdon said it has met with representatives of Steinberg's
controlling shareholders to discuss the possibility of acquiring
their Steinberg shares.
   If it succeeds, Oxdon said, it will review Steinberg assets and
liabilities with a view to reorganizing the company.
   That would likely involve the sale of all non-real estate
business operations, Oxdon said.
   The company said it would use Steinberg's existing Quebec real
estate holdings as the foundation for an expanding Quebec-based real
estate development company whose head office would remain in
Montreal.
   Steinberg is controlled by Mitzi Dobrin, Marilyn Cobrin and
Evelyn Alexander _ the three daughters of Sam Steinberg _ through
their majority ownership of the voting shares. They own about 52 per
cent of the voting stock.

   A skeptical report from a federal
laboratory hasn't reduced optimism in Utah that the sun's energy
source can be produced at room temperature, as fusion research moves
ahead with the help of General Electric.
   The University of Utah and GE announced Wednesday that their
scientists will collaborate in attempts to verify and explain the
widely disputed findings announced in March by university chemist B.
Stanley Pons and British colleague Martin Fleischmann.
   The collaboration is the first such agreement the university has
made with a major corporation, but doesn't rule out similar
arrangements with other companies, said James Brophy, the school's
vice president for research.
   Pons and Fleischmann maintain they were able in a tabletop
experiment to produce more than 100 times the energy needed to
produce it.
   Some researchers at other laboratories have duplicated parts of
the experiment, but Ames Laboratory officials said in Ames, Iowa,
that they had been unable to produce results similar to those
claimed by Pons and Fleischmann.
   ``I wish I could tell you otherwise,'' Tom Barton, a professor of
chemistry at Iowa State University and director of the federal
laboratory, said. ``I was just as excited as everybody else when the
revelations were made.
   ``I thought our energy crisis was over,'' he said.
   ``We explored (the findings) to the limits of our equipment and
expertise,'' he said Wednesday. ``I'm sorry to say we detected
nothing. It would have been exciting.''
   Ames Laboratory physicist Joseph Shinar said scientists are no
longer thinking of cold fusion as a source of energy. But he said
academics will continue looking into the matter.
   At the Utah Capitol on Thursday, the state fusion advisory
council met privately to hear progress reports from Utah and Texas
scientists. The council was created to decide whether and how to
spend $5 million set aside by the Legislature to fund fusion
research.
   Randy Moon, state science adviser and a member of the council,
said members were ``very encouraged and very upbeat'' about the
presentations, but he wouldn't elaborate.

   A ruptured pipeline at a Chevron ship
terminal dumped about 8,000 gallons of oil into the Willamette River
early today, but most of the oil was contained quickly, a Coast
Guard spokesman said.
   A Coast Guard helicopter flying over the scene reported a light
sheen of oil from the Chevron dock to the mouth of the river, about
seven miles north.
   A 16-inch oil pipeline ruptured underneath the shipyard dock
while an oil mixture known as charge stock was being transferred
onto the Chevron Louisiana tanker, said Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. David
Gault. Charge stock is a liquid form of asphalt mixed with 2 percent
to 3 percent diesel oil.
   Chevron notified the Coast Guard of the spill shortly after
midnight, Gault said. Refinery workers set out containment booms and
shut down the pipelines, and by 1:30 a.m., 99 percent of the oil had
been confined to the dock area.
   By daylight, crews from Chevron and Riedel Environmental Services
began raking the oil mixture onto absorbent pads and pulling the
pads out of the water, said refinery planner Dennis Sorensen.
   ``The tides and winds were such that the oil was held in a cove
near the dock,'' Sorensen said. He said the main spill was about 200
feet by 100 feet.
   A spill response team was on its way from Chevron headquarters in
San Francisco, and Sorensen said the experts would be able to
estimate the damage.
   Chevron could be fined up to $5,000 for the spill, Gault said.

   For five years, The Foxboro Co.'s factory in China
looked like a questionable investment but generated wonderful
publicity. Now it's the reverse.
   Foxboro has finally begun bringing home profits from the $10
million plant within the past year, and executives insist that the
outlook for profitability remains strong in spite of the current
turmoil.
   Meanwhile, though, the company faces a public relations problem
because of the Chinese army's bloody suppression of the student
democracy movement.
   Executives are quick to point out that the white stucco plant in
Shanghai, where 400 Chinese workers make industrial process control
equipment, accounts for only about 2 percent of Foxboro's $540
million in worldwide sales.
   It's important for them to get that message out, because many
companies that are associated with China have seen their stock
prices tumble since tanks rolled into Beijing's Tiananmen Square on
June 3-4.
   Foxboro officials are also on the defensive against calls for the
U.S. government to impose stiff sanctions and for American firms to
pull out of China.
   ``Unfortunately or fortunately, the people with facilities there
can't pick up and leave,'' said Gerald J. Gleason, a Foxboro vice
president.
   ``You've transferred the technology, you've transferred the
skills. If America withdrew its $3.2 billion worth of investment,
all we'd be doing is giving a gift of those assets to the Chinese
authorities _ and I don't think that's what would serve either our
national or our business interests best.''
   ``You always have to look over your shoulder when you go into a
venture like this,'' Gleason said. ``But we never thought it would
backslide this far.''
   Based in the southern Massachusetts town of Foxboro, the
81-year-old company has a worldwide work force of 6,000 people
engaged in producing measurement devices and control systems for oil
refineries, paper mills, breweries and other industrial plants.
   Chinese officials, eager to modernize their economy, invited the
firm to form a joint venture in 1979, starting a three-year series
of negotiations that Gleason likens to ``a ritual mating dance in
which ... we didn't know the words or the music.''
   When the Foxboro-Shanghai Ltd. plant finally opened in 1982, it
was the first U.S.-Chinese joint venture in high-technology
manufacturing, and it quickly became a showcase.
   Although its sales amounted to only a few million dollars a year
in the mid-1980s, Foxboro basked in reflected glory as the factory
was visited by Ronald Reagan, Henry Kissinger, Chinese leaders and
the heads of several Fortune 500 companies.
   Doing business in China took some adjustment. Former general
manager Don Sorterup said he had difficulty persuading Chinese
workers to use telephones or memos to resolve problems rather than
bicycling across the city to speak in person.
   Management was, however, able to persuade the Chinese to do
without the usual half-day per week of political education in the
workplace. Pay for a six-day workweek is $54 to $90.
   Company spokesman Richard Sherman said the plant, which is 51
percent-owned by the Chinese government and 49 percent-owned by
Foxboro, was profitable from the start. But for the first five
years, both sides agreed to plow back all their profits.
   Late last year, for the first time, the venture began paying
dividends to the home company.
   Following the crackdown on the student demonstrators, Foxboro
pulled out its two resident American employees _ the factory's
deputy general manager and chief engineer _ for their safety.
   For a week, the factory was virtually shut down, as unrest
paralyzed the country's public transportation system and only about
a quarter of the employees showed up for work.
   Since then, though, it has been running normally, prompting a mix
of wariness and optimism among the Americans.
   ``I think it'll settle down enough to send our people back in the
not-too-distant future,'' said Gleason. ``But personally I don't
think they can completely rebottle the whole thing. I don't think
this government will be secure and settled for a long time.''
   The factory's revenue roughly doubled to $20 million last year,
and Gary K. Willis, Foxboro's chief executive, said he believes it
will continue to be successful.
   ``We expect that, as stated by Chinese officials and our own
administration, the economic reforms and the progress that China has
made will continue,'' he said.
   ``We're pleased by the progress the joint venture has made and we
expect it to continue to grow.''

   Time Inc. shareholders today re-elected a slate
of four incumbent directors including Chairman Richard Munro, who
reiterated management's opposition to a $12.2 billion hostile buyout
offer from Paramount Communications Inc. and advances by any other
potential suitors.
   ``The company is not for sale,'' Munro said in response to
questions by shareholders at Time's annual meeting.
   Munro and other Time officials fielded a number of questions from
people attending the giant media company's first stockholder meeting
since Paramount announced its hostile $200 a share cash buyout offer.
   Many shareholders openly have questioned the company's rejection
of the Paramount offer and its decision to alternatively pursue a
$14 billion buyout of Warner Communications Inc.
   Shareholders re-elected board members Munro, who also is chief
executive, President Nicholas J. Nicholas Jr., Vice Chairman Jerry
Levin and outside director Donald S. Perkins, who ran unopposed. The
slate won support from 74 percent of the shares voting and 55
percent of Time's total common shares outstanding.
   Time stock was down $1.12{ at $154.62{ a share in mid-day trading
on the New York Stock Exchange. Warner was up 12{ cents to $60.12{ a
share and Paramount slipped $1.87{ to $59 a share.
   The meeting originally was called for June 23 for shareholders to
vote on Time's original stock-swap merger deal with Warner and the
board election.
   After Paramount announced a $10.7 billion takeover bid for Time
June 6, the meeting was rescheduled and Time officials withdrew the
merger proposal from the agenda.
   Several shareholders demanded to know today why the Paramount bid
and the proposed acquisition of Warner were not put to a vote. Time
officials said shareholder ballots are not required under law
because the company is not for sale, and because Time stock will not
be diluted in a Warner acquisition.
   ``We're working within all the rules,'' Munro said. ``It applies
to all companies.''
   The tone of the nearly two-hour meeting _ which filled the grand
ballroom of the New York Hilton _ was cordial. Many of the
shareholders attending also were Time employees who applauded in
support of management.
   Time maintains that Paramount's offer, since increased to $12.2
billion, is financially inadequate and subject to too many
conditions, including Paramount's obtaining commitments for buyout
financing and approvals to operate about 800 cable television system
Time owns.
   Paramount also has made its offer contingent on Time and Warner
terminating their own buyout agreement.
   Time is urging its shareholders not to be swayed by the size of
the Paramount bid _ which is $74 above the price at which Time stock
traded before Paramount announced its offer June 6 _ and to hold
their stock, profiting by allowing the Time-Warner merger to go
through.
   On Thursday, Paramount said it had taken a step toward satisfying
one condition of its offer as seven major banks agreed to help raise
financing for the bid.
   Paramount said each of the seven banks serving as co-agents in a
planned financing syndicate will contribute $1 billion, or a total
of $7 billion, toward the $15.6 billion estimated financing costs,
although it did not yet have commitments for the rest of the money.
   The seven, led by Chemical Bank, include two Japanese banks and
two Canadian banks. The two other U.S. banks are Bank of America and
Chase Manhattan.
   The seven also will lead a planned syndicate of banks intended to
provide 90 percent of the financing for the hostile buyout.
Paramount has said the syndicate would provide $14 billion while the
remaining $1.6 billion would be raised through the sale of debt
securities.
   Meanwhile, a group of U.S., European, Canadian and Japanese
banking officials met at the Time-Life building Thursday to hear a
presentation from Bankers Trust Co. and Manufacturers Hanover Trust
Co., The New York Times reported in today's editions. Those two
banks are trying to arrange $14 billion in loans that Time could use
to complete its offer for Warner.

   A potential choking hazard has prompted a
recall of the pin and nut that hold on the neck of the ``Seamore the
Action Seahorse'' water toy for infants, the Consumer Product Safety
Commission said Friday.
   The seahorse is a plastic infant seat shaped like a rocking
horse, which is held to the bottom of the tub or wading pool by

   Stock prices fell sharply here Friday for the
second consecutive session as weakness on Wall Street and worries
about the outlook for British interest rates weighed on the market.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell 31.0
points, or 1.42 percent, to 2,151.0. For the week, the key index
lost 16.5 points.
   Volume accelerated to 550.4 million shares, from 426.8 million
shares on Thursday.
   Despite the market's concerns, dealers said major institutional
investors still were not racing to sell their holdings.
   ``We're really just following Wall Street down,'' said one
dealer. ``Nothing has really changed ... fundamentally here in the
U.K. this week,'' he added.
   On the other hand, some analysts said equities remain vulnerable
to a possible rise in British interest rates amid signs of worsening
inflation.
   ``The fundamental trigger (for the market's decline) has been the
much worse economic picture in the U.K., the concerns about the
(British) currency and what that might mean for interest rates,''
said Tim O'Dell, international market strategist at UBS-Phillips and
Drew Ltd.
   Following Thursday's round of interest rate hikes in West Germany
and other European countries, ``it's just a matter of time until the
U.K. has to follow,'' O'Dell added.

<TEXT>
   MAI Basic Four Inc. said it plans to increase its
bid for Prime Computer Inc. and bust up Prime's recent agreement to
be acquired by J.H. Whitney &amp; Co.
   MAI's intentions were spelled out in a lawsuit against the two
companies filed Thursday in Delaware Chancery Court. While MAI did
not indicate how much it was willing to offer, the company said in
its suit a bid higher than Whitney's would be made soon.
   Whitney, a New York-based venture capital firm, has a tender
offer under way for as many as 49.5 million Prime shares. The firm
is paying $21.50 a share, or about $1.06 billion. After the tender
offer, Whitney will swap debentures for the remaining outstanding
shares.
   MAI originally bid $20 a share for Prime, but earlier this month
scaled back the offer to $19.50 a share for 49.5 million shares and
notes for the remaining shares. The offer is believed to have a
blended value of between $17 and $18 a share, analysts have said.
   In its lawsuit, MAI charged that the bidding for Prime had been
rigged and is seeking to have the auction for the Natick,
Mass.-based company reopened.
   In addition, MAI, a computer maker headquartered in Tustin,
Calif., wants Whitney to return to Prime the $20 million it received
in expense fees.
   Charging that the fee was improperly paid to Whitney, MAI said
the return of the money to Prime would ensure that the ``amount of
money MAI Basic can pay Prime shareholders can be correspondingly
increased.''
   In its suit, MAI complained of favoritism between Prime and
Whitney. MAI cited several ties between the two companies over the
years, including the fact that Prime Chairman David Dunn once worked
as a partner at Whitney.
   MAI also is seeking confidential business information about Prime
needed to complete its due diligence review as well as reimbursement
for its costs and attorneys' fees.
   A judge has yet to be assigned in the case.
   In New York Stock Exchange trading, Prime was down 12{ cents at
$19.12{ a share late Friday.
   Prime said Friday it believed MAI's lawsuit was ``entirely
without merit.''
   Anthony Craig, Prime's chief executive, issued a statement
saying, ``the Whitney merger agreement offers Prime shareholders a
significant increase over MAI's existing $19.50 partial tender offer
and greater value than what MAI was willing to offer in the auction
and negotiations that occurred last week. MAI is way off base in
alleging that there was a `rigged auction.' MAI lost because it was
not willing to pay top dollar.''

   Weather concerns triggered a rally in corn and
soybean futures prices and a slump in wheat prices Friday at the
Chicago Board of Trade.
   A forecast Thursday calling for rain over the next several days
in corn and bean growing regions was revised and the new, dry
forecast sparked a wave of buying, analysts said. Soybean prices
closed sharply higher.
   Expectations for good harvesting weather over the next few days

   Volume was light and trading cautious ahead of the U.S.
Department of Agriculture's quarterly crop reports, scheduled for
release after the session's close.
   Those reports were expected to have a heavy influence on the
markets Monday.
   At the close, wheat was unchanged to 3 cents lower, with the
contract for delivery in July at $4.02 a bushel; corn was 1\ cents

<HEAD>L.F. Rothschild Holdings Seeks Chapter 11 Protection</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   L.F. Rothschild Holdings Inc., parent of a
venerable Wall Street investment firm that suffered staggering
losses from the 1987 stock market collapse, sought Friday to
reorganize under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.
   The filing for protection from creditors does not include L.F.
Rothschild &amp; Co., a registered broker-dealer which is Rothschild
Holdings' principal subsidiary.
   Rothschild Holdings, which lost $84 million in the quarter ended
March 31, is in default on three debt issues totaling $60 million
and wants to restructure its debt to reduce interest expenses,
according to spokesman Kenneth Henderson.
   Separately, the Rothschild Co. brokerage said it intends to
re-enter the retail business with a discount operation pitting the
firm against such bigger discount brokers as Fidelity Investments
and Charles Schwab Corp.
   Rothschild Co., once a leader in public stock offerings for
high-tech companies, also will continue to offer corporate finance
and investment banking services with a greater focus on
``middle-market and smaller capitalized companies.''
   Rothschild Holdings filed its Chapter 11 petition with the
Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York in Manhattan.
Henderson said the company soon would file its reorganization plan,
which includes the swapping of existing debt for zero-coupon debt to
cut current interest expenses.
   The company's board of directors said that while the move may
affect the firm adversely in the short-term, ``following a
successful reorganization ... Rothschild will be better positioned''
to expand its business through the brokerage arm and ultimately
become profitable.
   Henderson said Rothschild Co. has ``a large number of deals in
the works'' mostly involving mergers and acquisitions and leveraged
buyouts, but he could not elaborate.
   With 75 employees, the current Rothschild is a shadow of the
old-line investment house and full-service brokerage that employed
as many as 2,200 people before the Oct. 19, 1987 stock market crash.
   Rothschild was formed in 1899 as L.F. Rothschild &amp; Co. In 1977 it
merged with C.E. Unterberg Towbin Co., then a young investment
boutique. But management strife forced out partners A. Robert Towbin
and Thomas Unterberg shortly after the company went public in 1986.
   As of Jan. 1, 1987, Rothschild ranked as the 18th largest U.S.
securities firm with capital of $289 million. But by the end of the
year, Rothschild posted a $129 million annual loss, $56 million of
which resulted from arbitrage and over-the-counter trading positions
held during the Black Monday market debacle.
   In an attempt to rebound and slash fixed costs, Rothschild
systematically sold or abandoned its retail brokerage, public
finance and municipal bond sales and trading operations. It also
ceased over-the-counter market making, arbitrage and the selling and
trading of mortgage-backed and high-grade corporate securities.
   The firm, which in late 1986 became one of just 40 primary
dealers that could buy and sell government securities as both
principals and agents, left that business in January.
   ``The object ... in the recent past is to reduce operations and
be as efficient as possible and go into businesses with ... the
lowest overhead,'' Henderson said.
   A year ago Rothschild Holdings became a subsidiary of Franklin
Financial Services, a services company that itself is a subsidiary
of Ottawa, Kan.-based Franklin Savings Association.
   Regarding the brokerage business's plans to offer discount
brokerage services, Henderson said, ``We're aware that it is a very
competitive business. But we do have customer lists from our old
retail operations and can rely on the Rothschild name.''
   Except for advertising, the cost of setting up discount brokerage
operations will be minimal, Henderson said. Back-office operations,
which he described as the heaviest contributor to overhead, will be
handled by another firm.

<HEAD>LIN Loses Round in Fight with Metromedia Over Cellular Sytems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Takeover target LIN Broadcasting Corp. lost the
final round in a legal fight Friday with Metromedia Inc. over the
right to buy Metromedia's interests in cellular telephone systems in
Philadelphia and New York.
   New York's highest court ruled that corporate partners that hold
rights of first refusal for future buyouts cannot force one another
to sell out if a sale to another party is abandoned.
   LIN's stock price tumbled as investors dumped shares following
news of the ruling, falling $7.12{ to $115.87{ in national
over-the-counter trading.
   The company, which is the object of a hostile $120 a share bid by
McCaw Cellular Communications, had estimated its stock value could
rise by up to $40 a share if it won the Metromedia case. The selloff
apparently reflected speculation that LIN's defeat might mean McCaw
would amend its $5.85 billion offer.
   The case before the state Court of Appeals involved multi-million
dollar agreements on cellular phone businesses in the New York City
and Philadelphia metropolitan areas between LIN and Metromedia.
   The two media companies were partners in two firms, and each had
the right of first refusal to buy the other out, should the other
company decide to sell to a third party.
   Metromedia decided to sell its holdings in Cellular Telephone
Company, which served the New York City market, and AWACS, Inc.,
which served Philadelphia, to Southwestern Bell. Metromedia advised
LIN of its intention, giving LIN the chance to buy the holdings
instead.
   Before LIN had accepted the offer, however, Metromedia decided
not to sell to Southwestern Bell. But LIN Broadcasting contended
that it still had the right to buy Metromedia's share in the two
cellular firms for about $380 million.
   The court disagreed and upheld a lower court's decision that said
Metromedia didn't have to sell its shares to LIN Broadcasting.
   The Appellate Division of the state Supreme Court had ruled
Metromedia didn't have to sell out.
   The Court of Appeals Friday upheld that ruling, 6-0, saying that
LIN's arguments tried to equate a right of first refusal with an
option.
   ``A right of first refusal merely provides that before an owner
sells, it will first give the other party a chance to buy,'' the
court said in an opinion.
   ``LIN argues ... that the law should require that the first
refusal offer be kept open for acceptance even after the
contemplated third party sale has been abandoned,'' the court said.
   LIN, which has holdings in cellular telephones, television and
publishing, said in a statement that the adverse decision does not
affect LIN's rights of first refusal on any future sales that
Metromedia may pursue.
   Had LIN prevailed over Metromedia, industry analysts estimated
LIN's stock value might rise as much as $40 a share. A defeat could
prompt McCaw to amend _ possibly lowering _ its offer.
   ``We are obviously disappointed by the outcome of the litigation,
although we have not yet ...'' said
   Wayne M. Perry, vice chairman of McCaw Cellular, said in a news
release that the company was disappointed by the decision although
it had not yet seen the ruling. He also said that until McCaw and
its advisers reviewed the ruling it would not be appropriate to
comment further.
   The release also noted that in its June 8 purchase offer, McCaw
reserved the right to amend its offer in the event of adverse
developments in the pending LIN-Metromedia litigation.

<HEAD>Singer's Future Dimmed By Mountains of Lawsuits</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Paul A. Bilzerian's piecemeal breakup of Singer
Co. since his stunning $1.06 billion takeover last year has spawned
mountains of lawsuits and left the one-time sewing machine maker on
shaky financial ground.
   Singer, now a defense contractor, is facing litigation nationwide
seeking more than $700 million in damages while its assets total
just $445 million, according to court documents.
   ``Whatever its prior plans, today the Singer Co.'s prospects for
survival appear dim,'' the government said in papers filed in
Baltimore that describe the company's financial condition as
``precarious.''
   Bilzerian, convicted by a federal jury of securities crimes
earlier this month, was charged Thursday by the Securities and
Exchange Commission with disclosure violations in his January 1988
takeover of Singer. Also Thursday, he resigned as chairman, chief
executive and board member of Singer.
   After seizing Singer with $1.9 billion in borrowed money,
Bilzerian sold eight of the defense contractor's 12 divisions,
shrank the work force to about 3,800 last year from 28,000 at the
end of 1987 and moved headquarters from Stamford, Conn., to his
hometown of Tampa, Fla., where about 20 people work today.
   In March, Bilzerian even sold the world-famous ``Singer''
trademark to a Toronto-based electronics firm that acquired Singer's
former sewing machine arm.
   A federal court in Baltimore in May blocked Singer from selling
any more assets without court approval after the Justice Department
contended the company planned further sales that would leave it
unable to pay damages in a case predating Bilzerian's arrival.
   In that case, the government claims that a Singer unit sold last
August, Link Flight Simulation Corp., had overcharged clients
beginning in 1980. The government is seeking $231 million in damages.
   Even more legal problems have emerged since Bilzerian moved in. A
group of more than 9,000 Singer retirees has asked a federal judge
in New Haven, Conn., to force Singer to set aside $235 million to
pay health and life insurance benefits the workers claim are
jeopardized by Singer's dismantling.
   There is a legal tangle with corporate raider T. Boone Pickens's
Mesa Limited Partnership, which lent Bilzerian $150 million during
the Singer takeover. If Pickens' investment isn't paid back in full,
he could get a chance to control Singer's board.
   Other lawsuits filed by stockholders, a former Singer executive,
a Bilzerian partner and other companies are pending in Stamford, New
York, California, Dallas, Baltimore and New Jersey.
   ``Never in my wildest imagination did I anticipate that the
company would be bought out and subsequently disbanded as it was,''
said Ralph Seel, a former Singer manager who worked for the company
43 years and filed the retirees' lawsuit last year.
   ``By and large it was looked at as a family business. It had
problems but never the kind that would cause the demise of a company
that was founded in 1851,'' he said. ``I still can't believe it
myself.''
   Bilzerian's selloff of Singer's divisions from July to October
last year netted close to $2 billion, according to company filings
with the SEC. That would have left the 39-year-old Bilzerian about
$100 million after paying back the money he borrowed to finance the
takeover.
   Among divisions sold were Singer's gas meter and electric motors
companies, a maker of signal interception systems for U.S.
intelligence, a maker of radar warning systems for the Air Force and
other defense and aerospace firms.
   The sales reduced Singer's assets to about $445 million from
$1.58 billion before the takeover. The company's shareholder equity
has shrunk to $80 million from $633 million, and the government
claims Singer plans to deplete it even more.
   In March, the Singer trademark was included in the acquisition of
SSMC Inc., Singer's old sewing machine division that was spun off in
mid-1986, by International Semi-Tech Microelectronics Inc. of
Toronto. Bilzerian's Singer has announced it is changing its name.
   Singer said in a statement announcing Bilzerian's resignation
that the company ``is not being liquidated and ... there has never
been any plan to liquidate it.''
   It said Singer expects second-quarter profits of $15 million
``and continued profitability for the remainder of 1989.'' The
statement said Singer would continue to pay retirees' life insurance
and health care benefits.
   Singer attorneys and executives on Friday refused to answer any
questions about the company.

   Stock prices closed out their worst week in more
than 15 months with another loss Friday in selling blamed on
spreading recession worries.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slumped 18.21 to
2,440.06, stretching its loss for the week to 91.81 points.
   That marked the biggest weekly drop for the average since it
tumbled 108.42 points March 21-25, 1988.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 7 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
641 up, 900 down and 442 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 170.49 million
shares, against 167.10 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those
stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market,
totaled 201.62 million shares.
   The market has been under pressure since the government reported
Wednesday that the index of leading economic indicators posted a
larger-than-expected 1.2 percent decline in May.
   More evidence of a dropoff in business activity came Friday
morning with the news of a 2.5 percent drop in new factory orders in
the same month.
   Until recently, Wall Street has been welcoming news of slower
growth in hopes of a ``soft landing'' that would allow for reduced
inflation and lower interest rates without much harm to corporate
profits.
   But in the past few days, analysts say, investors have begun to
look more closely at the possibility that the Federal Reserve might
not be able to pull off that tricky mission.
   As evidence, they noted that stocks in the past couple of days
have not responded favorably to continuing declines in open-market
money rates.
   The week brought a downbeat end to what had otherwise been a
strong first half of 1989 for the market. Since New Year's, the Dow
Jones industrial average has risen 271.49 points, or 12.52 percent.
   Losers among the blue chips included Philip Morris, down 1] at
138|; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, down { at 35; American
Express, down } at 33\; General Electric, down } at 51|, and Merck,
down 1 at 66~.
   Even amid the general caution, takeover rumors and speculation
buoyed such issues as Avon Products, up 1] at 35~, and Syntex, up 1]
at 49{.
   LIN Broadcasting fell 7[ to 115~ in the over-the-counter market.
McCaw Cellular Communications said it was reviewing the terms of its
$120-a-share offer for the company after LIN lost a court case
involving rights to cellular telephone systems in New York and
Philadelphia.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $18.33 billion, or 0.58
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .85 to 177.90.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fel 2.22 to 363.48, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was down 1.70 at 317.98.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
dropped 2.62 to 435.29. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 358.97, down 1.64.

   Oil futures prices finished mixed Friday in quiet
dealings ahead of the July Fourth holiday.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the contract for August
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S.
crude oil, rose 1 cent to settle at $20.27 a barrel. The contract
rose 23 cents on Thursday.
   Among refined products, the July contract for wholesale unleaded
gasoline lost 1.61 cents to close at 59.91 cents a gallon.
   The July contract for wholesale home heating oil lost 0.10 cent
to settle at 49.35 cents a gallon, but longer-term contracts gained
some ground.
   ``There was very little activity,'' noted Bob Baker, senior
energy analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   He attributed the gain in gasoline prices to a ``settling down''
of fears sparked by consumer groups that predicted long lines and
higher prices at the pump this summer.

<HEAD>Banc One Plans To Split Up MCorp Banks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Banc One Corp. Chairman John B. McCoy said Friday
he has cooked up a new Midwestern recipe to help turn around 20
failed Texas banks, including a strategy of ``friendly'' competition
and decentralized management.
   Under the plan, which would include slashing real estate and
other costs, McCoy predicted the banks would become successful
operations, adding 6 percent to 15 percent to the company's earnings
over the next five years.
   ``We believe on Day 1 we're going to make money,'' the head of
the Columbus, Ohio, bank holding company told reporters following a
presentation to securities analysts.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. announced Wednesday that Banc
One had won the bidding war for Dallas-based MCorp's 20 failed
banks. Banc One pledged to pay about $500 million over five years to
buy the banks.
   The banks were declared insolvent on March 28, seized by the FDIC
and packaged into a government-owned institution called Deposit
Insurance Bridge Bank, or DIBB.
   The FDIC will assume as much as $2 billion in bad loans, making
it the third costliest bank bailout.
   The banks and their branches, located in 22 Texas cities, will be
split into three regions. Each will be managed separately with its
own president and board of directors in place within a year, he said.
   ``Twenty bright people running things are better than one bright
person,'' the chairman said.
   McCoy said he will apply Banc One's formula for success over the
last 20 years to the new Texas operations, namely ``a very
decentralized operation and ... the absolute best financial
control.'' Banc One has about $25.3 billion in assets and reported
1988 earnings of $340 million.
   Under the plan, the banks would compete among themselves.
   ``When you're running your own bank with your own income
statement it makes you very comparable to everybody else,'' he said.
   ``I like peer pressure. How come Dallas is making more than
Houston? The Houston guy will get competitive, will get better. So
it's friendly peer pressure.''
   While some analysts view the transaction as a drastic change in
direction for Banc One, which has built a reputation on making
friendly acquisitions of successful banks, McCoy said Banc One is
starting with no real risk.
   ``Basically what we're getting is a bank with no bad loans,'' he
said. ``We always said we didn't want to buy a bad bank. We don't
think this is a bad bank.''
   The acquisition will have no effect on Banc One's 1989 earnings,
although the holding company will record some third-quarter
expenses. Banc One will be reimbursed by the government for all
expenses incurred in the first 140 days, he said.
   In addition, Banc One hopes to dramatically reduce costs,
including $50 million to $100 million a year in real estate costs,
McCoy said. It also will renegotiate equipment and other leases.
   Banc One will begin managing the banks July 5 under the name Bank
One Texas, and plans to purchase the banks after a four- to
six-month period during which problem assets would be identified.
   McCoy said Banc One would continue the conservative approach that
has made it a success in Midwest banking. In addition, it hopes to
rebuild many of the core consumer operations that were sold off,
including credit card operations.

<HEAD>Eastern, Pilots Hold Talks; Lorenzo Says Pilots Not Needed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Striking Eastern Airlines pilots who might want
to come back to work likely will find they've already been bumped
from their jobs, according to company boss Frank Lorenzo.
   Pilots union officials were to meet this weekend with management
and Eastern's court-appointed bankruptcy examiner to try to hammer
out a contract agreement that would end their walkout against the
company.
   The Air Line Pilots Association contends the talks may be aimed
at encouraging more strike-weary pilots to cross picket lines _ and
they come at a time when Lorenzo believes he holds most of the cards.
   In an interview Friday, Lorenzo said any returning strikers would
find most of the available jobs at the new, scaled-down Eastern were
taken up by the 500 or so new hires and 300 who crossed picket lines
who already are working and by other pilots who will complete
training in the weeks ahead.
   Eastern also is near agreement with creditors over its plan to
emerge from bankruptcy court protection as a scaled-down carrier
that would require only about 1,700 pilots to operate by December at
its target level of around two-thirds of its pre-strike size. That
compares with the 3,600 that flew the pre-strike version.
   ``We're not dependent on the pilots coming back, by any means,''
said Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern parent Texas Air Corp.
   ``I'm afraid (pilots union leaders) have another agenda'' than
resolving differences with management, he said. ``The agenda is to
show they're OPEC and they're not going to allow anybody to break
their price line.''
   The pilots and Eastern flight attendants joined a Machinists
strike that began March 4, and the company sought bankruptcy court
protection from creditors on March 9.
   Eastern and its major creditors this week asked U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge Burton R. Lifland to extend Eastern's exclusive right to
submit a reorganization plan, indicating that all fundamental
questions had been resolved and only technical differences remained.
   ``We're pretty close,'' Lorenzo said.
   Eastern wants to rebuild as a smaller carrier and pay off debts
with the proceeds of some $1.8 billion in asset sales, including
several that already have been approved by the bankruptcy court.
   Lifland already has approved a number of asset sales opposed by
the unions, including the sale of Eastern's prized Northeast shuttle
to developer Donald Trump.
   And this weekend, the airline is gearing up for a tripling of its
daily schedule. With 79 daily flights this week, Eastern planned to
begin 226 daily flights beginning Sunday.
   ``The real game is being played out with the consumers, with the
traveling public,'' Lorenzo said. ``Eastern is re-emerging as a
quality airline.''
   In another setback for the unions, David I. Shapiro, the
bankruptcy examiner for Eastern, told a congressional hearing
Thursday that the only alternatives for the airline were its
proposed downsizing or liquidation.
   But he said he would oppose liquidation and considered Ritchie's
proposal not viable.
   Shapiro also said that in this weekend's talks in Washington he
wanted to persuade the unions that Eastern's operations must be
scaled down to survive.
   Similar talks during the week yielded no tangible results, and
sources close to the situation say they expected the impasse to
continue despite planned round-the-clock sessions. ALPA officials
say they don't expect Eastern to offer the job-security provisions
the union says would be necessary for an agreement.
   Eastern recently sought bankruptcy court permission to cancel its
contract with the Air Line Pilots Association and to impose about
$50 million in wage and benefit concessions. The airline also seeks
changes in work policies that would allow it to increase pilots'
flying hours.
   ``We don't believe the situation justifies it,'' Bruce Simon, an
attorney for ALPA, said in a phone interview Friday during a break
in the negotiating sessions.

   The dollar closed slightly lower against several
key currencies after a sluggish U.S. trading session Friday.
   Gold prices rose in the United States following declines
overseas. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a troy ounce of
gold bullion at $373.50 as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from Thursday's late
bid of $370.15.
   Business on the currency markets was light with some traders gone
for an extended Independence Day break. Trading is expected to be
subdued again on Monday and will be closed in the United States on
Tuesday in observance of the Fourth of July.
   Samuel Lek, managing director for foreign exchange at Bear,
Stearns &amp; Co., said interest rate increases announced Thursday by
several European countries took the edge off traders' appetite for
dollars.
   ``There is less upward pressure on the dollar due to higher
European interest rates and expectations of Fed easing,'' said Lek.
   Interest rate movements typically influence currency values.
Lower U.S. interest rates relative to foreign rates would make
returns on dollar-denominated investments less attractive, thereby
lessening demand for dollars.
   There also might be less incentive to buy dollars if the Federal
Reserve Board shifts to a more generous credit policy, something
that some economists say is likelier now that economic growth seems
to be weakening significantly.
   On currency markets in Europe, dealers reported renewed
enthusiasm to buy dollars after buying was blunted Thursday by the
rate hike announcements.
   The Japanese and West German central banks sold dollars during
the European trading day but the intervention failed to have much
impact, dealers said.
   Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar rose to 143.95 Japanese yen from
Thursday's late 142.90 yen. Later in London, the dollar traded lower
at 143.60 yen.
   In New York, the dollar closed at 143.82 yen, down from 144.00
yen late Thursday. The Fed was believed to have sold dollars and
bought the yen, which has been weighed down lately by Japan's
political problems.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.5535 late Friday, cheaper
for buyers than Thursday's late $1.5650. Later in New York, it cost
$1.5530 to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.5435 on Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Thursday's
late rates, included: 1.9515 West German marks, down from 1.9640;
1.6757 Swiss francs, down from 1.6880; 6.6290 French francs, down
from 6.6690; 1,412.5 Italian lire, down from 1,419.00; and 1.1966
Canadian dollars, up from 1.1946.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Thursday's late rates,
were: 1.9510 West German marks, up from 1.9430; 1.6728 Swiss francs,
up from 1.6650; 6.6200 French francs, up from 6.5925; 2.2020 Dutch
guilders, up from 2.1875; 1,410.50 Italian lire, up from 1,407.00,
and 1.1980 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1950.
   Gold prices turned in a mixed performance. Precious metals
traders in Europe attributed declines there to a lack of buying
interest at the end of the month.
   Gold closed in London at a bid of $371.75 a troy ounce, down from
$375.25. The late bid price in Zurich, Switzerland, was $371.00,
down from $376.00. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at $371.35 bid,
down from $376.45.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for delivery
in July rose to $374.60 a troy ounce from Thursday's settlement
price of $373.90.
   Silver prices also were mixed.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at $5.14 bid a troy ounce,
down from $5.28. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for July
delivery settled at $5.155 a troy ounce, up from $5.120 on Thursday.

<HEAD>Dry Forecast Sparks Soybean Rally</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A drier-than-expected forecast for soybean-growing regions
evaporated fears of rain and sent soybean prices soaring Friday on
the Chicago Board of Trade.
   But the Department of Agriculture's quarterly crop reports,
released after the close of trading Friday, showed
higher-than-expected inventories of soybeans, corn, and especially
wheat. Analysts predicted that Monday's prices could slide as a
result.
   On other markets, cattle prices dipped while pork futures were
mixed; coffee prices rallied; energy prices were mixed; and precious
metals closed higher.
   A revised forecast deleting rain and calling for dry conditions
over the next several days sparked the rally in soybeans and corn,
analysts said.
   Expectations for good harvesting weather over the next few days
in the southwest winter wheat regions kept the lid on wheat prices.
   Trading was light in anticipation of the crop reports, which
showed 465 million bushels of soybeans, 3.419 billion bushels of
corn and 694 million bushels of wheat on hand as of June 1.
   Analysts had estimated the soybean and corn figures would be
slightly lower, but the wheat figure was far above their estimate of
625 million bushels.
   The higher wheat figure indicates ``a shift in domestic usage''
toward corn and other non-wheat feeds because wheat is overpriced,
said William Biedermann, vice president and director of research at
Allendale Inc., a futures brokerage in Crystal Lake, Ill.
   Wheat settled 1 cent to 7} cents lower, with the contract for
delivery in July at $3.97\ a bushel; corn settled 3} cents to 5}
cents higher, with July at $2.66} a bushel; oats were 3 cents to 3{
cents higher, with July at $1.49{ a bushel; and soybeans were 10
cents to 13} cents higher, with July at $7.35 a bushel.
   Trading in cattle and pork futures at the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange was light in anticipation of the USDA's quarterly
hogs-and-pigs report, which was released after the close and also
showed bearish U.S. inventories as of June 1.
   The total figure _ 55.50 million _ was 1 percent lower than a
year earlier but ``a million head larger than was expected,'' said
Chuck Levitt, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in Chicago.
   The figures mean this year's hog-and-pig slaughter into the fall
will be comparable to last year's oppressive levels, and likely will
send prices tumbling on Monday, Levitt said.
   Live cattle prices settled .62 cent lower to .05 cent higher with
the contract for delivery in August at 70.15 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were .15 cent to .55 cent lower, with August at 80.87 cents a
pound; live hogs were .30 cent lower to .45 cent higher, with July
at 48.67 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were 1 cent lower to
1.15 cents higher, with July at 35.85 cents a pound.
   Coffee prices rose on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange
amid renewed hopes that a collapse of the market's price-support
system can be averted.
   The International Coffee Organization, faced with discord among
its member nations, is scheduled to vote Monday on differing
proposals to extend an international price-support agreement beyond
its Sept. 30 expiration.
   In addition, the ICO's executive board has recommended extending
the pact for two years, but abolishing its price-stablizing quota
machinery, which would leave coffee prices after Sept. 30 subject to
free-market forces for the first time since 1963.
   However, unconfirmed reports indicated that the ICO may postpone
Monday's vote, which would give members time to resolve their
differences and come up with a compromise that could leave price
supports in place, analysts said.
   That hope sparked Friday's rally.
   Coffee prices settled .50 cent to 3.25 cents higher, with the
July contract at $1.1137 a pound.
   Gold and silver prices on New York's Commodity Exchange reversed
Thursday's slide as the dollar weakened and helped ease fears of a
recession, said Bette Raptopoulous, a metals analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   Gold prices settled unchanged to $3.50 higher, with the July
contract at $374.60 a troy ounce; silver settled 2.5 cents to 3.5
cents higher, with July at $5.155 a troy ounce.
   Crude oil and heating oil futures rallied while unleaded gasoline
dipped at the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 1 cent to 5 cents
higher, with the contract for delivery in August at $20.27 a barrel;
heating oil was .10 cent lower to .30 cent higher, with July ar
49.35 cents a gallon; and gasoline was .30 cent to 1.61 cents lower,
with July at 59.91 cents a gallon.

   Orders to factories for manufactured goods
tumbled 2.5 percent in May, the steepest drop in 10 months, the
government reported, providing more evidence of a weakening economy
caused by high interest rates.
   The Commerce Department reported the decline Friday in orders for
both durable and non-durable goods to a seasonally adjusted $234
billion last month was the steepest falloff since orders dropped 3.6
percent in July 1988.
   Orders for durable goods, big-ticket items expected to last more
than three years, represented virtually all of the May decline. They
were down 4.5 percent to $123.6 billion, even worse than a
preliminary report last week that they had fallen 4.2 percent.

   The commission Friday denied challenges by AT&amp;T competitors and
the state of Alaska to a new pricing method that goes into effect
Saturday.
   The new plan, which the FCC adopted March 16 following two years

1960s, the FCC has regulated how much AT&amp;T could earn above its
costs.

   An index measuring the ability of the typical
American family to buy a home fell in May to its lowest level in
three years, primarily because of increases in mortgage rates, the
National Association of Realtors reports.
   The real estate trade group said Friday its affordability index
was at 100.1 last month, down from 103.2 in April and the lowest
since May 1986 when it measured 99.8.
   May's index level meant that a family earning the median income
of $32,644 annually had 0.1 percent more income than needed to
qualify for a mortgage covering 80 percent of the purchase price of
a median-priced home.

   Bond prices rose Friday as a positive mood
prevailed in light, pre-holiday trading.
   The U.S. Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond rose 25-32 point, or
$7.80 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the
opposite direction to price, declined to 8.03 percent from 8.09
percent late Thursday.
   Bonds have benefited recently from a convergence of positive
influences, including recurring strength in the dollar, signs of
slower economic growth and, just this week, an influx of funds from
the stock market.
   Marshall B. Front, an economist at the Chicago investment and
mutual-fund management firm of Stein Roe &amp; Farnham, said the market
was bullish throughout the session. However, volume remained light
in advance of the July 4 holiday.
   Front said investors are becoming more convinced the Federal
Reserve will soon ease credit in step with recent weak economic
signals.
   Also contributing to the market's positive mood was a continued
weakness in the stock market early in the day after Thursday's sharp
drop, when the the Dow Jones industrial average lost about 46{
points, its steepest dive since mid-March.
   Marilyn Cohen, of the Beverly Hills, Calif.-based brokerage
Capital Insight, said a lot of money had moved from the stock market
into the bond market as a result.
   The bond market will be open for business Monday but activity is
expected to be light because many traders plan a long Fourth of July
weekend.
   In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of
short-term government issues rose between 3-16 point and 9-32 point,
intermediate maturities increased 5-16 point to \ point and
long-term issues were up between 9-32 point and 11-16 point,
according to Telerate Inc., a financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, rose 3.63 to 1,185.87.
   In corporate trading, industrials posted minor gains. Moody's
Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures total return
on a portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years
or longer, rose 0.26 to 327.44.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds rose 5-32 point. The average yield to
maturity edged down to 7.29 percent from 7.31 percent.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 8.25 percent as the
discount slid 1 basis point to 7.98 percent. Yields on six-month
bills declined to 8.13 percent as the discount fell 5 basis points
to 7.72 percent. Yields on 1-year bills issued at auction Friday
were 8.09 percent with a discount of 7.53 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted at 9\ percent, down from from 911-16 percent late
Thursday.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Revlon Inc. announced Friday it will no longer
use animals in testing the safety of its products or in researching
ingredients and developing new formulas.
   The cosmetics company said instead it will rely on the judgment
of scientists, non-animal test methods and historical information on
whether substances are safe for people to use.
   Revlon's announcement marks the completion of a 14-year program
aimed at eliminating the use of animals in all phases of research,
development and manufacture of its makeup and toiletries, the New
York-based company said in an announcement.
   The beauty products maker had been among the first U.S. companies
to proclaim it would eventually stop tests on animals.
   Revlon said it closed down its own animal testing laboratory in
1986 and had reduced its animal testing requirements by more than 90
percent prior to Friday's announcement. From now on, Revlon said it
will not ask independent labs to conduct any tests on animals.
   Companies in a variety of industries say they are researching
replacements for animal tests. Cosmetics maker Avon Products Inc.
recently said it was stopping animal tests after deciding it could
ensure the safety of its products through alternative means.
   An animal welfare group, People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals, praised Revlon's action.
   ``We are delighted that Revlon has gone one better on Avon by
announcing a complete end to all animal testing,'' said Susan Rich,
coordinator of PETA's campaign against animal tests. ``We are still
concerned that Avon will continue to test ingredients.''
   Avon has said that some of its suppliers may have to test on
animals as they develop new formulas.

<HEAD>Jury Awards $7.8 Million to Johnson Adversary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal court jury on Friday returned a
$7.8 million verdict against Johnson &amp; Johnson in a
breach-of-contract suit brought by a Pennsylvania distributor of
medical products.
   Advanced Medical Inc., of Horsham, Pa., had contended that
Johnson &amp; Johnson and three of the health-care giant's wholly-owned
subsidiaries tried to sabotage Advanced Medical's exclusive contract
to distribute a portable blood analyzer.
   The U.S. District Court jury awarded a total of $750,000 in
compensatory damages against Johnson &amp; Johnson and the three
subsidiaries: Arden Medical Systems Inc. of Minneapolis, and Ortho
Diagnostic Systems Inc. and Johnson &amp; Johnson Professional
Diagnostics Inc., both of Raritan, N.J.
   It also awarded Advanced Medical $7.15 million in punitive
damages against Ortho Diagnostic, Johnson &amp; Johnson Professional
Diagnostics, and the parent company.
   A spokesman for Johnson &amp; Johnson at the company's New Brunswick,
N.J., headquarters refused to comment beyond a brief prepared
statement.
   ``The decision by the jury was totally unfounded and we will
quickly move to have it overturned by the court,'' said Robert
Kniffin, a Johnson &amp; Johnson spokesman. ``We have at all times
honored our contract with Advanced Medical and the allegations are
without foundation.''
   Lee A. Rosengard, a lawyer for Advanced Medical, said that in
1986 the company entered into a contract with Arden to distribute
Arden's only product _ a portable blood analyzer.
   Three months after the contract was signed, Johnson &amp; Johnson
bought Arden with plans to distribute the product on its own, but
found there were 14 exclusive contracts for the distribution rights
with companies around the country, including Advanced Medical,
Rosengard said.
   Arden began negotiating to buy out the contracts, but did not
negotiate with Advanced Medical, Rosengard said.
   Instead, Rosengard said, Arden took away its sales support for
the distributors and Johnson &amp; Johnson came out with its own version
of the blood analyzer, which Johnson &amp; Johnson Professional
Diagnostics began selling in Advanced Medical territory at a lower
price.
   The case was tried before U.S. District Judge James McGirr Kelly.

   The electronic cruise control on some

on, the company announced Friday, offering to replace the units free
of charge.
   There haven't been any reports of accidents attributed to the
defect, Hyundai Motor America spokeswoman Debbie Douglas said.
   The problem affects 8,550 Excels in model years 1986 through 1989
_ cars with cruise control and an optional, more powerful radio. The
radio draws enough power to interfere with the computer chip that
runs the cruise control, causing the speed to vary, the Korean
carmaker said.
   Owners can take the cars to Hyundai dealers, who will replace the
cruise control microprocessor unit free.
   Some 766,000 Excels have been sold in this country since 1986.

<HEAD>CBOE Suspends Three Traders Accused of Rule Violations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three traders have been suspended for allegedly
violating rules of the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the CBOE
announced Friday.
   The suspensions, which bar the three from trading on the
exchange, range from one week to two years, said CBOE spokesman
Warren Moulds.
   All three traders agreed to the sanctions without admitting or
denying guilt, he said.
   Ivan A. Wells, a former trader for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.'s
office in Clearwater-Countryside, Fla., was accused of the most
serious violation _ making numerous trades that were deemed
unsuitable for customers' financial situation and needs.
   Wells also was accused by the exchange of making numerous options
trades in several accounts without prior approval of the customer or
of Dean Witter, from August 1984 to February 1986.
   The exchange also alleged that Wells conducted unapproved options
seminars.
   He agreed to a 2-year suspension from trading at the CBOE, Moulds
said.
   John G. Stark, a former Dean Witter trader with the company's
Westlake, Ohio, office, was accused of making several trades without
prior written authorization from the customer or the company.
   Stark, who also was accused of overstating actual account equity
to a customer, agreed to a three-month suspension from CBOE trading,
Moulds said.
   Stark's alleged misconduct took place from August 1986 through
January 1987, Moulds said.
   Raymond C. Paskus, a CBOE member trader, was accused of violating
a CBOE rule requiring traders to trade at least 25 percent of their
contracts in person on the exchange floor. The violations allegedly
took place in March 1986.
   He received a one-week suspension from the exchange, the
spokesman said.

   Time Inc.'s annual meeting was generally a
cordial affair, although disgruntled shareholders pressed company
officials to explain why Time rejected a $12.2 billion hostile bid
from Paramount Communications Corp. and is pursuing its own $14
billion offer for Warner Communications Inc.
   Several shareholders at the nearly two-hour meeting Friday
questioned why Time management did not allow votes on the
$200-a-share Paramount bid and the proposed acquisition of Warner.
   Time President Nicholas J. Nicholas Jr. told shareholders that
ballots were not required under law because Time was not for sale
and because Time stock would not be diluted in a Warner buyout.
   Time's initial plan to merge with Warner in a stocknro told shareholders,
``We're working
within all the rules ... It applies to all companies.''
   One shareholder, Anita Barishaw, of Englewood, N.J., complained
to Munro and Nicholas, ``The shareholders are nothing...we are not
consulted on anything.''
   Many other shareholders _ including an undetermined number of
Time employees _ applauded Munro and Nicholas as the executives
reiterated their opposition to the Paramount bid and support of the
Time-Warner deal.
   Shareholders re-elected an unopposed slate of four incumbent
directors at the meeting, including Munro, Nicholas, Vice Chairman
Jerry Levin and outside director Donald S. Perkins.
   The slate won support from 74 percent of the shares voting and 55
percent of Time's total common shares outstanding.
   Shareholders also rejected a proposal to have the entire board
put up for re-election annually. Directors' terms now are staggered,
with different board members up for re-election every year, making
it more difficult for dissidents to win control of the board.
   The meeting originally was called for June 23 for shareholders to
vote on Time's original stock-swap merger deal with Warner and the
board election. After Paramount announced a $10.7 billion takeover
bid for Time June 6, the meeting was rescheduled and Time officials
withdrew the merger proposal from the agenda.
   The takeover battle was expected to be resolved in Delaware
Chancery Court, where on July 11 Time and Paramount will present
arguments on Paramount's contention that Time put itself up for sale
when it agreed to merge with Warner.
   Under the laws of Delaware _ where all three companies are
incorporated _ a company that has put itself up for sale must
consider whatever offers will give shareholders the maximum value.
   Munro disputed Paramount's claim and said Paramount was using it
as an excuse to make its offer.
   Time has urged shareholders not to be swayed by Paramount's bid _
which is $74 higher than the price at which Time traded before
Paramount announced its offer _ and to hold their stock, profiting
by allowing the Time-Warner merger to go through.
   Munro told shareholders Friday that the company has received the
approvals it needs for the Warner deal.
   Time maintains Paramount's offer is financially inadequate and
subject to too many conditions, including Paramount's obtaining
commitments for buyout financing and approvals to operate about 800
cable television system Time owns.
   Time stock fell 50 cents Friday to close at $155.25 a share in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Warner rose 37{ cents to
$60.37{ a share and Paramount slipped $1.62{ to $59.25 a share.
   Friday's meeting filled the grand ballroom of the New York
Hilton. Time kept cameras and tape recorders out in accordance with
a standing company policy for annual meetings.
   Munro and Nicholas tried to evade photographers afterward,
dashing away as they left the building.

   A Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. employee
pleaded guilty Thursday to mail fraud in a scheme to embezzle
$200,000 from the firm's accounts.
   Richard Kofler, 38, of New York entered the plea before U.S.
District Judge John Keenan in Manhattan.
   Kofler admitted that he used his job as operations manager for
the International and Special Accounts branch office to create a
fictitious account for a mutual fund at which Prudential-Bache had a
house account.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Kerry Lawrence said Kofler directed the
mutual fund to transfer shares from Prudential-Bache's account to
the fictitious account.
   Kofler would write letters in the name of the phony account
holder asking that shares be redeemed and sent to private post
office boxes, Lawrence said.
   He faces a maximum of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine
when sentenced Sept. 18.

<TEXT>
   A Montana law limiting the damages people
may collect when wrongfully fired does not deprive employees of
their rights under the state constitution, a divided Montana Supreme
Court ruled Thursday in upholding the law.
   A dissenting justice, however, said the decision clears the way
for a legislative onslaught against plaintiffs' rights in lawsuits,
adding, ``It may be the blackest judicial day in the history of this
state.''
   The court's 4-3 decision may have national implications because
other states are considering ``wrongful discharge'' statutes similar
to Montana's, said Joel P. Kelly, a Los Angeles lawyer who
represented a company that was sued in the Montana case.
   ``It upholds the validity of state legislatures' authority to
reform the wrongful discharge area. That makes it more likely for
employers to get behind similar reforms in other states,'' Kelly
said in a telephone interview.
   While most states grant employers broad latitude in firing
workers, the Montana law says an employee can be fired only for just
cause.
   The law, enacted in 1987, says a person who sues an employer for
wrongful firing cannot collect damages beyond the equivalent of four
years of wages and benefits. And no damages can be awarded for pain,
suffering or emotional distress.
   Russell E. Meech, fired from his $28,000-a-year job at Park Place
Health Care Center in Great Falls, sued employer Hill Haven West
Inc. of Tacoma, Wash., which operates health care facilities in
several states. Meech sought punitive as well as actual damages and
challenged the state law on the basis that it denied his right to
full legal redress for wrongs suffered.
   A state judge in a separate case declared the law's limits on
damages unconstitutional.
   But the high court majority, in an opinion by Justice Russell
McDonough, said the law ``does not violate the fundamental right of
full legal redress, because no such `fundamental right' is created''
by the Montana Constitution.
   While the state constitution says the courts must be available to
all on an equal basis, it does not prevent the Legislature from
devising or specifying particular remedies for wrongs suffered, the
majority said.
   ``Wrongs recognized at law are corrected as provided by law,''
McDonough wrote. ``Legislatures in the Anglo-American system have
long been held to possess the authority to expand or reduce claims
and remedies available at common law.''
   In a blistering dissent, Justice John C. Sheehy said the ruling
``cleans the scalpel for the Legislature to cut away unrestrainedly
at the whole field of tort redress. Perhaps worse ... the court
throws in the sponge as a co-equal in our tripartite state
government.''
