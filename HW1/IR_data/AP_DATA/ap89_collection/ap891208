   A general commanding the last rebel
stronghold after the collapse of the coup against President Corazon
Aquino refused to surrender Saturday, declaring, ``We have opted to
die.''
   In Manila, an attacker hurled a grenade into the city's crowded
main post office, injuring at least 16 people, police and hospital
sources said. It was not immediate known if the attack was related
to the coup attempt.
   Radio station DZRH said at least two people were killed in the
grenade attack.
   Mrs. Aquino, addressing a rally of more than 100,000 people
Friday, appealed to Filipinos to unite against those who would
``destroy our democracy.''
   The rebels, who began the coup bid Dec. 1 with attacks in
Manila, were taking their last stand at Cebu City, 350 miles south
of Manila. About 400 rebels led by Brig. Gen. Jose Commendador
controlled the Mactan air base.
   Commendador told reporters Saturday, ``Surrender is out of the
question.'' An aide said Commendador was ``waiting word from
Manila,'' but he did not elaborate.
   Rebel and loyal troops faced each other at a bridge linking
Mactan island to Cebu, the Philippines second major commercial
center. A 600-member marine battalion was flown to Cebu on Friday
to reinforce loyal units.
   The military announced Saturday that three brigadier generals
and at least 12 middle-grade officers would be relieved of their
duties for participating in the uprising.
   At least 83 people were killed and more than 580 wounded in the
attempted coup. It was the sixth and bloodiest military revolt
since Mrs. Aquino was swept into office in February 1986 by a
``people power'' revolution that forced Ferdinand E. Marcos, who
had ruled the Philippines for 20 years, into exile.
   In his report on the post office attack, police Lt. Jun Javier
of the homicide section said the M-26 fragmentation grenade was
hurled at an area of the first floor where employees were selling
stamps.
   At least 16 people were taken to the nearby Philippine General
Hospital. There were no reports of any fatalities, Javier said.
   Military officials have claimed that the rebels who sought to
oust Mrs. Aquino plan an urban terrorism campaign.
   Mrs. Aquino told the rally Friday she would not relinquish the
presidency to Vice President Salvador Laurel, who was elected on
her ticket but has become a rival. He has suggested they both
resign and call new elections.
   ``He cannot wait to be president,'' Mrs. Aquino said. ``I will
never give up this position to him.''
   She also vowed to investigate whether opposition Sen. Juan Ponce
Enrile was involved in the revolt.
   The rally was at the site where hundreds of thousands of
Filipinos, supporting the civilian-military uprising against
Marcos, filled the streets in 1986 so tanks could not pass.
   Friday's crowd was smaller than those in 1986 but appeared to be
among the largest since Mrs. Aquino gained power. Government
offices encouraged employees to attend, and participants were
brought by bus from as far away as Angeles, 50 miles to the north.
   Mrs. Aquino did not mention complaints by the rebels and other
critics that she has not delivered on promises of social justice
and reform.
   She delivered most of the speech in Tagalog, the main Philippine
language, using an earthy accent and phrases associated with
uneducated Filipinos. Her style recalled the simpicity and
frankness that won millions of Filipinos to her cause in 1986.
   Speaking briefly in English, Mrs. Aquino said: ``I want all of
us to unite and to give support to the democratic systems of
government and to go after these people who want to destroy our
democracy, who want to destroy our economy, who want to destroy the
Filipino people.''
   Estimates of the crowd varied widely. Government television said
1 million people attended, but reporters put the number at more
than 100,000.
   In her remarks about the vice president, Mrs. Aquino said: ``He
keeps on urging me to resign. What does he think I am, stupid? If
Laurel really loves our country like he always says, then I suggest
he resign so we can use the money from his office.''
   The crowd cheered wildly and chanted ``Cory! Cory! Cory!'' when
she mentioned Laurel and Enrile, whom she fired as defense minister
in November 1986 after a failed coup by his followers.
   She said she would appoint a presidential commission to
determine whether Enrile or other opposition figures were involved
in the latest rebellion.
   Laurel said in a statement after the speech: ``She has not only
lost control of the nation, she has lost control of herself.
President Aquino is herself the principal cause of all six coups
that have occurred during her term, due to her incompetent, weak
and corrupt leadership.''
   In Washington, the State Department reiterated U.S. support for
Mrs. Aquino's government. Spokesman Richard Boucher said the
pro-Aquino demonstration was ``one of many signs we have from a
variety of people on the political spectrum in the Philippines that
there is very strong support for democracy and support for the
democratically elected government, and our support for that, of
course, is very firm.''
   On Thursday, Laurel predicted attempts to overthrow Mrs. Aquino
would continue until she addressed fundamental problems of poverty
and social injustice.
   Loyal forces have recaptured most installations seized by the
rebels, many of whom belonged to elite marine and Scout Ranger
units.
   Early Thursday, mutineers ended their takeover of Makati, the
Manila financial district, after allowing more than 1,800
foreigners to be evacuated from hotels and apartments in the area.
   On Thursday, the military loaded hundreds of captured onto a
prison ship in Manila Bay. Military officials said investigations
would be conducted of those above the rank of captain to determine
whether they would be court-martialed.
   They said lower-ranking officers and enlisted men would be
reassigned to other units, as has generally been the case after
previous coup attempts.
   Most officers involved in past rebellions have been confined to
barracks. A few have been sentenced to up to 10 years in prison,
but remain confined to barracks pending ``reviews'' of their
convictions.

   An investigation into corruption in East
Germany reached the top level Friday with the announcement of
criminal charges against former Communist Party chief Erich
Honecker and five of his ousted lieutenants.
   Four of the disgraced former Politburo members were thrown in
jail pending an investigation. Honecker, who underwent gall bladder
surgery last summer, was too ill to be jailed and remained under
house arrest, prosecutors said.
   After decades of hearing their leaders say the West was poised
to plunder the Communist nation, shocked East Germans have grown
increasingly angry as they have learned the extent of the
plundering from within.
   During a parliament session Dec. 1, one lawmaker alleged former
officials stashed $54 billion in Swiss bank accounts.
   Prosecutors have not confirmed that figure, but there have been
nearly daily revelations of corruption and lavish living by the
country's former hard-line leaders.
   The latest comes with the opening of criminal investigations
against Honecker, 77; former Premier Willi Stoph, 75; and four
aging cronies.
   Four of the six former Politburo members already are in prison,
said prosecution spokesman Peter Przybylski. Former Politburo
member Hermann Axen, 73, was having an eye operation in Moscow.
   ``They are accused of damaging the economy of the German
Democratic Republic and of personally enriching themselves by abuse
of office and corruption,'' Przybylski said.
   The charges carry a penalty of up to 10 years in prison.
   Those arrested were Stoph; Guenther Kleiber, 58; Werner
Krolikowski, 65; and Erich Mielke, the 81-year-old former chief of
the once-dreaded secret police.
   Przybylski did not say when the trials would take place, adding
that police had searched the suspects' homes. He also did not
specify their alleged crimes.
   For weeks, officials have been disclosing how the ousted
leadership lived lavishly with the best imported goods and had
fancy hunting lodges, while the state-run news media has spoken of
fortunes smuggled abroad.
   Honecker and other former Politburo members already were under
house arrest in their exclusive compound outside East Berlin.
Honecker was ousted as party leader on Oct. 18 and all were later
expelled from the party.
   Three other former Politburo members already had been imprisoned
on suspicion of corruption.
   East Germans also are reeling from the scandal involving the
nation's former chief foreign trader, Alexander
Schalck-Golodkowski, who surrendered to West Berlin authorities
Wednesday.
   Schalck-Golodkowski is accused of running a ring that illegally
sold weapons to countries in South America, Africa and the Middle
East.
   He insists he is innocent, but has agreed to pay back $31
million. That's only a fraction of the sum East German news media
say he may have embezzled.
   His deputy, Manfred Seidel, was arrested and charged with
smuggling out $110 million. Another figure connected to the scandal
has committed suicide, the official news agency ADN said.
   The allegations are particularly embarrassing for a country that
routinely has said it is short of desperately needed Western
currency.
   Also Friday, the Christian Democrats said investigators had
found the party's former leader, Gerald Goetting, responsible for
financial irregularities. The allegations were turned over to
prosecutors for possible criminal charges.
   The Christian Democrats are one of the four smaller parties that
recently broke a decades-long alliance with the Communists.

<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A research panel has exposed 50
paintings as falsely attributed to Rembrandt van Rijn, the
17th-century Dutch master, the group announced Friday.
   Among the exposed paintings are a 1637 portrait of Rembrandt, on
display in the Norton-Simon Museum in Pasadena, Calif., and the
1635 ``Landscape with Carriage,'' owned by the Wallace Collection
in London.
   The Norton-Simon Museum acquired the portrait, which the panel
attributes to Rembrandt contemporary Carel Fabritius, for about
$3.8 million in 1969, the Amsterdam newspaper Het Parool reported.
   A spokeswoman with the Norton-Simon Museum said the museum was
unshaken by the finding and the portrait would remain on exhibit.
   ``We are going to leave the Rembrandt on display. We don't
endorse the methods of the research project,'' said Vicky Rogers,
reading from a prepared statement. ``Attributions of works to
Rembrandt have been debated over 300 years. This is another chapter
in that ongoing debate.
   ``We'll let history be the judge.''
   The authoritative Rembrandt Research Group published its third
of five volumes Friday. The series is looking at all 500 to 600
works attributed to Rembrandt.
   Of 100 paintings examined in Volume 3, ``about 50 percent are
not genuine Rembrandts,'' said panel member Jozua Bruin.
   ``The outcome of Volume 3 reflects the 50 percent score in the
first two volumes,'' Bruin said. In those volumes, roughly 100
paintings were branded as wrongly attributed to Rembrandt.
   The third volume, in which Rembrandt's monumental ``Night
Watch'' has gotten the stamp of approval, was published Friday. The
first and second volumes were published in 1982 and 1986
respectively.
   Most of the falsely attributed works were probably painted by
Rembrandt students or paid assistants in his workshop, according to
Bruin.
   The panel, which is subsidized by the Dutch government, began
its work 21 years ago. It scrutinizes each work with a close
analysis of the paint, the cloth or wood on which it is painted,
and ultimately, the painting style, according to Bruin.
   Born in 1606, Rembrandt was a prolific painter whose innovative
use of light made him one of the outstanding representatives of the
17th-century Dutch school. He died in 1669 at age 63.
   The Rembrandt Research Group has drawn criticism from other art
historians, who have accused it of basing some of its conclusions
on shaky scientific grounds.
   ``It's only natural that a project of such magnitude provokes
scientific criticism,'' Bruin said. ``But of course, Rembrandt is a
special cause _ think of the financial interests involved.''
   He said it's not clear when the project will be finished.

   Despite their reputation for high standards, so
many Japanese cars have been recalled to repair defects this year
that the government has given automakers an unusual warning to keep
a closer eye on quality.
   The Transport Ministry issued the warning Thursday at a
bimonthly meeting with executives of the Japan Automobile
Manufacturers Association following a recall of Toyota's new luxury
Lexus cars in the United States this week.
   ``It's unusual for us to make such a warning,'' said a Transport
Ministry official. ``But there were problems that we couldn't
ignore this time.
   ``Since foreign automakers make such recalls more often,
Toyota's Lexus case wouldn't damage the company's image that much
... I hope,'' he added.
   Toyota recalled all 8,000 of its Lexus LS400 Luxury automobiles
in the United States. It is working to limit the damage to its
image caused by the recall of the $35,000 car that went on sale
three months ago to try to cut into the shares of Mercedes Benz,
BMW and others in the U.S. luxury car market.
   The warning on quality control was given to representatives of
Nissan and Honda, the current executives in the automakers
association, and they were expected to pass it along to other
companies, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   When asked about the warning, the manufacturers association
said: ``We have nothing to say as long as each company uses a
recall system in line with the Transport Ministry's guidance.''
   Since September, recalls in Japan have involved Nissan Motor
Co.'s Silvia, Bluebird and 180SX models; Daihatsu Motor Co.'s
Charade and Applause; and eight Toyota models. In each case, poor
quality in auto parts caused malfunctions shortly after the new
cars hit the streets.
   On Dec. 1, Toyota's subsidiary in the United States recalled the
Lexus voluntarily after defects were found in the cruise-control
mechanism and the brake light in the rear window. It also said an
alternator cable that connects to the battery would be checked. The
cars had been produced between May and October, said Shuji Okabe, a
company spokesman.
   He said Toyota had notified the U.S. government about the
defects.
   Fumio Matsuda, spokesman for the Japan Automobile Consumer
Union, said the officially reported cases ``are only the tip of the
iceberg.''
   He said there had been no decline in Japanese technology, but
frequent model changes allow automakers little time to check the
quality of new cars.
   ``Recalls are the result of overwhelming competition,'' Matsuda
said.
   He also said the Transport Ministry has loose rules concerning
defects, contributing to persistent quality problems.
   The ministry does not require automakers to report defects and
recall cars until they find out causes and remedies.
   In September, the ministry warned Toyota for delaying too long
in recalling 200,000 cars in Japan to repair an engine problem.
   Toyota spokesman Hiroshi Hashimoto said the malfunctions had not
always appeared when the cars were tested, but he conceded, ``It
took us too long to decide whether we should handle the defect as a
recall or to repair (the cars) individually as a service to
customers.''
   In October, Nissan recalled nearly 38,000 cars in Japan, which
cost the company $6 million, a Nissan official said. The problem
was a lack of durability in a flywheel, part of the clutch
mechanism in manual-transmission cars, he said.
   Nissan's 240SX model, the U.S. version of the Silvia, had no
problem because it has a different engine, he said.
   Daihatsu recalled its new Charade and Applause compact models in
November due to brake and fuel tank problems. About 2,500 Charades
and 3,200 Applauses already had been exported to the United States
and Europe, Daihatsu said.

   Just when you thought we were leaving the
workaholic 1980s behind, comes a chilling sign that rampant
careerism may be here to stay.
   The decade in which power breakfasts nudged aside three-martini
lunches may have left an indelible mark on our culture. Come
January, faithful users of the Week-At-A-Glance appointment
calendars will find that daily starting times in one of the most
popular versions have been changed from 8 a.m. to 7 a.m. The end of
the day is an hour earlier _ at 7:30 p.m.
   ``We're not a 9 to 5 society anymore,'' said Mike Kinnick,
marketing director for Keith Clark, the Sidney, N.Y.-based company
that makes the calendars.
   Customers complained their day started before the 8 a.m. time
listed in the planner, he said.
   ``We heard from customers and we decided to make the change. I
think as our society gets more intense, people are just starting to
work more and go to work earlier,'' Kinnick said.
   But at least one customer was dismayed.
   Barbra Zuck Locker, 37, who has used the Week-At-A-Glance for
years, was so disturbed when she noticed the shift in times in the
1990 calendars that she wrote a letter to The New York Times that
appeared this week.
   ``Alas, 1989 days began at 8. ... Now, my book-calendar informs
me, I can go home at 8:45. That's OK. But do I really want to begin
my mornings in the 1990s at 7 a.m.?'' she said.
   Locker fits the stereotype of the '80s woman. She is a
psychologist in private practice in Manhattan as well as a
corporate psychological consultant and director of employee
assistance programs at Citicorp.
   But rather than welcome the change in her weekly planner, Locker
is upset about what she sees as an inability among Americans to
relax.
   ``We seem to be afraid of leisure time, maybe it makes us
anxious,'' Locker said from New York. ``We've created a culture
that we thought was going to a be a leisure culture. In the 1920s,
we thought we'd evolve to this future with all these labor-saving
devices and we'd have all this free time. But we've done a
360-degree turn. People are working so hard and have less leisure
time.''
   In addition to changing the daily starting time, the 1990
Week-At-A-Glance almost does away with Sunday.
   In a portion of the letter that didn't appear in the Times,
Locker wrote:
   ``Sunday. The blank space of the week. A left-hand corner
mercifully bereft of 15-minute time slots. Beautifully empty
12-lined Sunday suddenly compressed to eight lines so that Saturday
can start at 7 a.m. Is this the message for the '90s?''
   Not necessarily, according to Filofax Inc., a subsidiary of a
British company whose thick planners came to symbolize
self-important, fatuous yuppies who used them to schedule their
every waking moment.
   Filofax's most popular planner, a six-ring organizer, has blank
blocks so customers can fill in their own times. If they buy one of
10 inserts that fit the planner, two of them come with scheduled
times. The good news, at least for Locker, is that Filofax still
believes the day begins at 8 a.m.
   ``The trend is to keep things very flexible,'' Martin Hackel,
president of Filofax, said from Stamford, Conn.

   Most newspapers aim to serve their readers, but
Street News is unlike most newspapers. Its mission is to serve its
salespeople, an army of homeless men and women.

sales force from his Times Square offices. Some arrive hungry on
their first day and are given a sandwich and 10 papers, which sell
for 75 cents each.
   Of that, 50 cents goes into the salesman's pocket, and a nickel
goes into a bank account in his or her name. Money from the account
can only be withdrawn as a cashier's check made out to a landlord
for an apartment.
   ``If you can shake a cup, you can sell this newspaper,'' says
Persons, a 33-year-old rock musician who has been active in
philanthropic efforts. ``We're trying to offer an alternative to
panhandling.''
   The monthly Street News is just 2 issues old, but Persons says
it is a success. The first issue sold 40,000 copies in New York;
the second issue debuted in Los Angeles and Denver. Within 18
months, Persons expects Street News will be available in at least
16 cities, with total sales reaching a million.
   The first issue featured articles by singers Gloria Estefan,
Richie Havens, Joe Cocker, James Taylor and actor Danny Aiello.
There were stories about ``The Art of Train Conversation'' and
``Tourist in Tiananmen.''
   The second issue featured stories by Joe Simmons of the rap
group Run-D.M.C. and actress Mariette Hartley. But the emphasis was
on articles by and about the homeless themselves, including a
feature about one of the newspaper's top salesmen, who also wrote a
story about loneliness.
   In the premiere issue, Persons wrote that he was inspired to
create the newspaper when he saw homeless people in Grand Central
Terminal.
   ``I thought, `What an untapped work force! All these people just
lying around here. But what can they do? This thought plagued me
off and on, day and night for about a week until suddenly it hit
me. ... They could sell newspapers!''' Persons wrote.
   For money and help, he turned to connections he had made as a
musician and in his work on Live Aid and as head of Street Aid, a
non-profit organization that fights hunger in America.
   ``Homelessness has gotten to be a such a crisis that everyone
has trouble giving to someone with a cup,'' said Wendy Koltun, the
paper's advertising director and a former dancer with the New York
City Ballet.
   ``When they hear of someone working for a living they feel
better giving them money. It's not like you're giving them a free
meal.''
   Some of the 150 salespeople who joined the staff have dropped
out, but half remain. Persons estimates they make an average of
$200 a week; one man sold 1,100 copies in four days, for $550 in
cash and $55 in the bank.
   William Allen, 36, said he was on the verge of homelessness
after losing his job three months ago, but the newspaper gave him a
way to try to raise enough rent money to stay off the streets.
   ``I'm going to get my life back together,'' he said.
   Jesse ``Aki'' Windley, 46, netted $300 one week. The college
graduate said the breakup of his marriage sent him into a tailspin
that ended on the streets. Now, the paper that bills itself as
``America's Motivational Non-Profit Newspaper'' has resurrected his
hopes.
   ``My aim is to be the director of distribution,'' he said.
   Others have more modest goals. Bobby Gaddy, 47 and homeless for
three months, sells 25 to 30 papers a day. It's enough to buy food
and cigarettes but not enough to keep a roof over his head _ ``I'll
be down in the subways somewhere. Who knows where I'll sleep?'' he
said.
   The newspaper promotes opportunities in its classified ads. One
tells where to redeem bottles and cans. Another job requires
``residence or referral letter from shelter or regularly attended
kitchen.''
   But Windley says he hopes never to leave Street News.
   ``I intend to be here until the building disintegrates,'' he
said. ``I feel as though I'm part of the company. I feel I'm one of
the cinderblocks. I have friends here. Why do I want to stay? I'm
at home.''

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Perhaps the ugliest expression
of the distrust or outright hatred of foreigners here is a leaflet
dropped on the capital recently by air force planes.
   It is directed to ``The Salvadoran Patriot'' and reads: ``You
have the full and legitimate right to defend your life and
property. If in order to do that you must kill FMLN terrorists as
well as their `internationalist' allies, do it.''
   FMLN stands for the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front,
the guerrilla army waging a 10-year-old war for power against a
succession of U.S.-backed governments.
   ``Internationalists'' are Americans, Canadians, Europeans and
non-Salvadoran Latin Americans who work with the poor, either
through church-affiliated groups or humanitarian organizations.
   Several hundred reside in El Salvador. Rightist considers them
subversives.
   The politics of most are quite to the left of center, but the
overwhelming majority work entirely above ground for respected
organizations such as the Lutheran Church or the Jesuit Refugee
Service.
   ``Let's destroy them. Let's finish them off,'' says the flier,
which is signed ``Air Force of El Salvador'' below the legend,
``With God, reason and might, We shall conquer.''
   The air force is the most vehemently rightist of the three
military branches.
   Consulted about the incendiary leaflet, Col. Rene Emilio Ponce,
chief of the joint chiefs of staff, acknowledged the air force
wrote it.
   He said he interpreted it to refer only to foreigners who are
active combatants in the insurgent army.
   ``There is no campaign of persecution of foreigners,'' he said.
   However, more than two dozen ``internationalists,'' including 10
Americans, have been detained during raids on their organizations
or homes since a rebel offensive began Nov. 11.
   The great majority have been expelled under a state of siege
imposed in response to the rebel push. One American, 28-year-old
Jennifer Casolo of Thomaston, Conn., was charged with terrorism
after police discovered ammunition and explosives buried in her
back yard.
   She denies complicity with the rebels, saying the munitions may
have been buried during one of her frequent trips outside the
capital.
   Five Spanish-born Roman Catholic priests were among eight people
massacred Nov. 16. Rightists had long denounced the five, who were
naturalized Salvadorans, and their Salvadoran-born Jesuit
colleagues as revolutionary ideologues.
   The government radio station in the days before the slaying
broadcast telephone calls from listeners denouncing the priests as
foreigners and mercenaries of ``international'' Marxism.
   La Prensa, El Salvador's most widely circulated daily newspaper,
dedicated virtually all its editorial page Wednesday to two
articles, one titled ``Undesirable Foreigners'' and the other
headlined ``Stricter Controls on Entrance.''
   ``The long Salvadoran conflict has been a stage for the direct
interference of foreigners who in the most diverse guises, from
simple adventurers to religious missionaries, have come to our
small and convulsed country to `experience' the drama of the Third
World,'' one editorial said.
   ``Many of these noxious characters have dressed themselves in
the garb of humanitarian piety, supposedly `accompanying' the most
humble in their pain _ but in reality giving personal and material
support to subversion,'' it added.
   Eileen Rosin, 35, of Long Island, N.Y., who had worked here for
two years as the sole representative of Medical Aid for El
Salvador, left hurriedly this week after discovering her office had
been ransacked.
   For eight years, Medical Aid had channeled donated funds for
prosthetic devices, delivered donated medicines to local hospitals,
and sent dozens of children to the United States for operations
beyond the technical means of Salvadoran institutions.
   Ms. Rosin, whose modest apartment and habits reflected her low
pay, left reluctantly and worried about people her organization was
supposed to help.
   ``We had two little girls lined up for heart operations in the
States,'' she said over coffee just before heading for the airport.
``I don't know what will happen to them now.''
   She paused, then said, ``But I don't want to rot in jail
either.''

   Singer Kenny Rogers says his six-year separation
from his son, Kenny Jr., ``was detrimental to him, and I think
equally detrimental to me.''
   For six years, starting when Kenny Jr. was 12, the pair didn't
meet or talk, according to an interview in the Dec. 8-10 issue of
USA Weekend. The estrangement began after Rogers and his third
wife, Margo, had what he calls a ``volatile breakup.''
   Over the last six years, father and son have tried to patch up
their relationship.
   They will act out a relationship not unlike the one they have in
real life in a one-hour television drama, ``Christmas in America,''
scheduled to air Wednesday on NBC at 9 p.m. EST. Kenny Sr. plays an
ambitious photographer who is reconciled with his son, Kenny Jr.,
after a period of estrangement.
   The 52-year-old Rogers calls the reconciliation with his son ``a
slow healing process. ... This is a wound that was gaping at one
time and it's growing together.''
   Kenny Jr., now 25, recorded his first album _ ``Yes-No-Maybe'' _
in October. He says that when they met after the six-year gap it
was ``like picking up kind of where we left off.''

   Paul McCartney is singing a slightly different
tune now about a possible Beatles reunion.
   When he suggested last month that he, George Harrison and Ringo
Starr may come together for a reunion, Harrison responded there
wouldn't be one ``as long as John Lennon remains dead.''
   McCartney said Thursday he understood. But he still held out
hope for a reunion.
   ``There can't be a Beatles reunion because John died,''
McCartney told a news conference before his concert at the SkyDome.
   ``And I don't think any of us would be interested in
substituting someone for John, even (his son) Julian, which has
been suggested. But there is a film we might get around to in a
couple of years that we've been meaning to do, and there might
possibly be some involvement there where we play together.''
   He said the group wouldn't call it a Beatles reunion, but the
media probably would.

   Entertainer Wayne Newton's lawyer says if
his client's $5.3 million damage award in a suit against NBC News
is overturned, it would have ``dire consequences to the public.''
   Newton sued the network in 1981, claiming that a series of
broadcasts in 1980 defamed him. The broadcasts linked Newton to
alleged crime figures and centered on his purchase of the Aladdin
Hotel here.
   Lawyer Morton Galane said in a brief filed with a federal
appeals court in San Francisco last month that if the verdict is
overturned, ``victims of malicious defamation by the mass media
will have no effective remedy and the media will not be deterred
from disseminating knowing or reckless falsehoods.
   ``The cost of litigating against a media giant like NBC will
often exceed any compensatory award the victim could hope to
receive.''
   If upheld, Newton's award would be the largest on record arising
from a news report.
   A jury awarded Newton $19.2 million in damages in 1986. The
following year, U.S. District Judge Myron Crocker cut the award to
$5.3 million, but upheld the jury's libel findings. NBC appealed.

<HEAD>Sources: Soviets Withdrawing Fighters From Cam Ranh Bay</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union is packing up MiG-23 fighter
jets based at Vietnam's Cam Ranh Bay, the U.S.-built port the
Soviets turned into their largest naval facility outside their
borders, administration sources say.
   ``There have been a series of reports that they have been
disassembling and packing up their MiG-23s for shipment,'' said one
source, who spoke on condition he not be identified by name.
   ``The reports have triggered speculation the Soviets might be
scaling down, or could be preparing a pullout from Cam Ranh Bay.''
   The changes indicate ``it could be a complete pullout, or it
could lead to a significant reduction'' in Soviet military
involvement at the base, the source said Thursday.
   There could be several reasons behind such a possible pullback,
the source and other Asian specialists said in a series of
interviews.
   The move could be a reflection of the worldwide Soviet reduction
in naval activities that has occurred over the past months, which
some U.S. analysts have speculated may be due to economic pressures.
   The Cam Ranh changes also could foreshadow a possible unilateral
Soviet initiative designed to one-up the United States as it
prepares to enter into negotiations on renewing leases for U.S.
bases in the Philippines, the administration source said.
   ``It could be a setup to embarrass us,'' the source said.
   Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev proposed several years ago to
withdraw from the base _ his most strategic foreign site in Asia _
if the United States would pull out of the six bases it has leased
in the Philippines.
   U.S. officials rejected the proposal.
   The leases on the U.S. bases expire in 1991 and the renewal has
become a hotly debated topic, particularly in light of the recent
U.S. intervention against the rebel forces attempting to overthrow
President Corazon Aquino.
   One defense analyst, who declined to comment specifically on the
MiG-23 move, said the idea of a unilateral Soviet drawdown to point
up the U.S. problems with the Philippines wouldn't be out of line
with Pentagon assumptions.
   ``They'd like to complicate our lives,'' the analyst said of the
Soviets. ``We've been predicting some de-emphasis there.''
   Jonathan Pollack, the head of the RAND corporation's political
science department and a specialist on the role of the Soviet Union
in Indochina, said the Soviets have tended to keep about 20 vessels
and 40 aircraft at the Cam Ranh base.
   Pollack, in a telephone interview, said he would not be
surprised by a Soviet cutback.
   ``If there are changes in the more distant deployments, it could
be explained by a mix of factors _ not only economic, but also a
reconsideration of what is crucial to Soviet security concerns,''
he said.
   The analyst said that ``lots of Gorbachev's proposals are for a
P.R. (public relations) effect,'' but he wouldn't be surprised if a
reduction at Cam Ranh Bay was made without any publicity.
   ``In the context of what clearly is a major change in the
U.S.-Soviet relationship, the value of distant Soviet bases is
reduced,'' he said.
   Cam Ranh Bay _ located several hundred miles from Ho Chi Minh
City, formerly Saigon, on Vietnam's eastern coast _ offers one of
the finest harbors in Indochina and provides a safe anchorage to
all types of vessels year round.
   The Japanese made use of the harbor in World War II, but it was
transformed into a modern military facility by the United States
during the Vietnam conflict when warehouses, airstrips and other
naval support facilities were built.
   According to the London-based International Institute for
Strategic Studies, the Soviet Union has regularly deployed at the
base an average of one or two submarines and a range of surface
combat ships, as well as patrol, mine warfare, amphibious and
support vessels.
   The air units have included six Tu-95 ``Bear'' long-range
bombers, 16 Tu-16 ``Badger'' fighter aircraft and a squadron of the
MiG-23 ``Flogger'' fighter jets, the institute reported in its
``The Military Balance 1989-1990'' publication.

   The bounce isn't there anymore. Mikhail
Gorbachev doesn't light up a room simply by entering it. Often
unpredictable in the past, the Soviet leader did not challenge
President Bush at the Malta summit with dazzling new proposals.
   The closest he came was proposing that nuclear-armed warships be
included in arms control negotiations. But Gorbachev had
telegraphed the initiative through the media before he sat down
with Bush, and the administration had decided to resist even
tinkering with the U.S. Navy before the president left Washington.
   Gorbachev also showed Bush a map illustrating how the Soviet
Union was ringed by American military might. The Soviets had used
the tactic of negotiating with pictures before, and the gambit did
not produce U.S. concessions.
   Gorbachev pulled no rabbits out of a hat, offered no massive
withdrawal of Soviet forces, extended no invitation to banish
nuclear weapons.
   As a result, the president was not placed in the position of
having to cope with an ingenious and inventive adversary by meeting
him halfway.
   The relief on the American side was as obvious as the choppy
weather. Bush had all the time he needed to lay out a dozen mild
suggestions to improve U.S. relations with Moscow. He was not
forced to come up with a quick reply to dramatic and unexpected
propositions from the Soviet side.
   Still it wasn't all sweetness and light, as Bush remarked at the
end.
   The hundreds of reporters who dutifully filed from Malta the
gushing accounts of an improved superpower relationship provided to
them by anonymous U.S. ``sources,'' are balancing the record now
that they are back home with the negative side of Bush's first
rendezvous with Gorbachev.
   It turns out, for instance, that the Soviet leader has no
intention of complying with a U.S. demand that he force the ouster
of President Najibullah in Afghanistan.
   Bush told Gorbachev the Moslem rebels who are trying to take
power in Kabul with U.S. support are unwilling to reach a
settlement with Najibullah to end an 11-year-old civil war that has
taken an estimated 1 million casualties.
   But Gorbachev dismissed the demand, saying Najibullah, whose
forces are armed by Moscow, is a national figure who is growing
more popular all the time.
   It also turned out that the Soviets have not shelved their
opposition to the U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative. The dispute
over ``Star Wars'' is still an obstacle to concluding a treaty to
trim bombers, missiles and submarines in time for the
Bush-Gorbachev summit meeting in Washington next June.
   The Soviets offered in September to separate negotiations over
space-based defenses from the talks on reducing strategic weapons
arsenals 30 percent to 50 percent. But it turned out at the summit
that Gorbachev still is determined to establish clear rules on what
the two sides can do with weapons in space.
   Two other problems surfaced even before the summit adjourned.
   Gorbachev told Bush he did not know how Soviet arms are getting
to leftist rebels in El Salvador. And he is determined to have
negotiators cap submarine-launched cruise missiles.
   That's a double problem. The missiles are hard to keep track of
and the United States is reluctant to curb one of its trump cards
in the nuclear weapons competition.
   Gorbachev has been in power nearly five years now.
   American participants in the Malta summit found him confident as
ever.
   He also seems graver, which is understandable considering the
uphill task he has undertaken to reconstruct the Soviet economy and
to maneuver around the dazzling changes that are sweeping Eastern
Europe.
   ``He gave me the impression of a man sure of himself, in
control, not ebullient, nor the quiet of worry,'' said a senior
U.S. official who was at the table with Bush aboard the Maxim Gorky.
   ``He spoke in a very forthright manner about the economic
problems he was up against, his thoughts for tackling them. His
basic theme was `I've got problems and I`m working on them,''' the
official recalled.
   But when you look at the Soviet problems, the official said,
``they are very deep and very broad.''

   The conviction of a former Boeing Co.
marketing executive sends a clear signal that the government won't
tolerate illegal trafficking of classified Pentagon documents
within the defense industry, says the U.S. attorney whose office
tried the case.
   A U.S. District Court jury deliberated only two hours Thursday
before convicting Richard Lee Fowler on 39 counts arising from his
possession of secret Defense Department and National Security
Council budget documents.
   Fowler, a 64-year-old former Air Force officer who had worked in
the Pentagon, could be sentenced to 310 years in prison and fined
$225,000. Sentencing was set for Jan. 12.
   Fowler's lawyers said they would appeal.
   The charges against Fowler included conspiracy, mail fraud,
illegal conveyance of classified documents and conversion of the
papers for his own use.
   The documents, known as ``planning, programming and budget
system documents,'' generally dealt with Pentagon procurement
plans, sometimes for five years.
   Employees for several defense contractors testified that they
were part of a nine-company network whose Washington
representatives swapped the classified documents in the late 1970s
and early 1980s.
   The nine companies were identified in testimony as Boeing,
Honeywell, Bendix, IBM, RCA (since merged into General Electric
Co.), Grumman, Raytheon, Rockwell and Martin Marietta.
   ``This case, in my view, puts everyone in the defense
contracting industry on notice that theft, conversion and
conveyance of classified documents will not be tolerated,'' said
Henry Hudson, U.S. attorney for the eastern district of Virginia.
``It sends a clear message it won't be tolerated.''
   Hudson said investigations continue into the use by defense
contractors of classified Pentagon documents, but he refused to
discuss specifics.
   Fowler seemed stunned as he faced the jury while the court clerk
read the verdict on each of the 39 counts. At times, he closed his
eyes and other times stood stoically while members of his family
cried.
   One of the jurors wiped away tears and others fought back tears.
   Fowler worked for Boeing from 1978 until he was fired in 1986
after an investigation began.
   Boeing pleaded guilty to receiving classified documents from
Fowler and has agreed to pay fines of $5.2 million.
   Fowler had little to say after the verdict, but when asked
whether he had been made a scapegoat, he said: ``I would rather not
comment on that. I mean, you can draw your own conclusions.''
   During closing arguments, Assistant U.S. Attorney Randy Bellows
described Fowler as the ``linchpin'' of the document-swapping
network.
   ``Mr. Fowler was the common thread running through every witness
who was trafficking in this secret material,'' Bellow said. ``Mr.
Fowler played a unique role in the conspiracy: He was the
supplier.''
   Defense lawyer John Bray said the only reason Fowler was
prosecuted was because he refused to divulge his sources.
   ``Dick Fowler has made a very unfortunate enemy by what he has
done _ the Pentagon,'' Bray said.

   Nine monkeys that have been made immune to the
simian AIDS virus may hold in their blood cells and tissues the
critical clues needed by scientists to develop an AIDS vaccine for
humans.
   ``These are now very valuable animals,'' said Michael
Murphey-Corb, head of a team of scientists at the Delta Regional
Primate Research Center in Covington, La. ``There's a lot we can
learn from them.''
   In a study published today in the journal Science, Murphey-Corb
and her Tulane University colleagues announced they have developed
a vaccine that protects rhesus monkeys from simian immunodeficiency
virus (SIV), which causes AIDS in monkeys.
   Other AIDS researchers praised the work, one calling it a
``giant leap'' in the race to find a human AIDS vaccine.
   Nine animals inoculated with the vaccine are healthy, despite
being injected with powerful doses of the killer virus. SIV is a
close, genetic relative of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),
which causes AIDS in humans.
   ``We can look at these animals' immune system and (learn) what
exactly these monkeys' immune systems did to cause them to be
protected,'' Murphey-Corb said in an interview.
   ``We now have a foundation ... so that we can progress in a
straightforward fashion toward development of a human HIV vaccine.''
   Dr. Robert Gallo, director of AIDS vaccine research at the
National Cancer Institute and co-discoverer of the AIDS virus,
called the Tulane research ``very important and highly
significant.''
   ``Although SIV is not the same as HIV and a rhesus monkey is not
the same as a human, SIV is the closest virus that we have to
HIV,'' he said. ``It has quite a bit of similarities and it
produces a similar disease.''
   Dr. Wayne Koff, chief of AIDS vaccine research at the National
Institutes of Health, said the work by Murphey-Corb and her
colleagues ``has dispelled any doubts about our ever being able to
create a vaccine against HIV.''
   He called the monkey study results ``the most significant
advance in the vaccine field since we started the AIDS vaccine
program. It is a giant leap.''
   ``It's terrific,'' said Dr. Allan Goldstein, a George Washington
University School of Medicine researcher who in May started testing
a type of human AIDS vaccine.
   ``It's an important step in understanding the mechanism for
protection against a retrovirus that is related to human disease,''
Goldstein said.
   ``This is another piece of the puzzle that is going to hopefully
allow us to understand the face and nature of the enemy and how to
develop the protection that is needed.''
   Koff said the Tulane study proves that the primate immune system
can be primed to protect itself against a retrovirus. Both SIV and
HIV are retroviruses that kill by destroying the immune system of
the host.
   Gallo said researchers will be able to examine the monkeys'
immune systems and determine how the extremely complex network of
cells, proteins and organs interact to produce an immunity to AIDS.
From these clues, he said, scientists may be able to determine
which combination of HIV viral proteins will produce such an
immunity in humans.
   ``What we will likely get is what immune response correlates
best with protection and then you will go try to reproduce that in
man with proteins from the virus,'' he said.
   Murphey-Corb said her team developed the monkey vaccine by
purifying samples of SIV, then killing the virus with a chemical
called formalin. That left the virus inactivated, but with all its
proteins intact.
   Gallo, Koff and others said the technique used for developing
the monkey vaccine could not be applied safely to humans because it
is difficult in using a whole virus to be absolutely certain that
every viral particle is killed when the vaccine is prepared.
   Murphey-Corb acknowledged the problem.
   ``There is a conceptual chance that one virus particle would
remain alive after treatment so that when you immunize an
individual, you might actually infect them,'' she said.
   ``It would be not that safe for humans. But the experimental
approach is there. What works for one should very likely work with
the other.''
   A number of candidate vaccines for the human AIDS virus are
being tested, but they are based on specific proteins from HIV
rather than the whole virus. Some use synthetic compounds that
match specific viral proteins.
   In the Louisiana study, injections using the inactivated simian
virus were given to nine rhesus monkeys that had not previously
been exposed to SIV. Thirteen months later, the test monkeys and
five control monkeys received injections of live virus _ 10 times
the amount that earlier studies had shown was enough to produce
simian AIDS.
   ``Of the control animals, all five became infected and three of
them died within seven months,'' Murphey-Corb said. ``In the nine
vaccinated animals, eight are not infected and nine of nine are
clinically well.''
   Murphey-Corb said a single inoculated monkey showed some
laboratory signs of viral infection, but it has no clinical
symptoms of AIDS.
   She said the experiment proved that the monkeys reacted to the
killed whole virus by developing immunity against the live virus,
the same system used to develop some polio vaccines.
   Though SIV and HIV are distinctly different viruses, almost 50
percent of their genetic pattern is the same.
   ``What works for one should very likely work with the other,''
said Murphey-Corb. She emphasized, however, that the monkey vaccine
cannot be used in humans against HIV.
   As of Sept. 30, 1989, AIDS had been diagnosed in 109,167
Americans, of whom more than half, 64,849, have died since June 1,
1981, according to the Centers for Disease Control. No one is known
to have recovered fully from AIDS.

<HEAD>New Menace in Nintendo's Path _ And it Has Subpoena Power</HEAD>

   Super Mario must face fire-breathing dragons,
death-dealing birds and a gauntlet of other fantasy threats to
rescue a kidnapped princess. But can Nintendo's video-game star
handle a federal investigation?
   The chairman of a House panel demanded one Thursday, as he
suggested the maker of the immensely popular electronic games is
using unfair and abusive sales practices to monopolize the market
and keep prices high.
   Super Mario, as just about any school-age child knows, is one of
a legion of characters in the games sold by Nintendo. He has leaped
from the video screen to T-shirts, lunch pails and cereal boxes.
   With Mario bouncing across a screen next to him, Rep. Dennis
Eckart, D-Ohio, said at a news conference that he has asked the
Justice Department's antitrust division to investigate Nintendo of
America Inc. for possible violations of antitrust laws.
   He turned over what he called ``strong evidence'' found by his
subcommittee.
   ``The question is: Has Nintendo grown so big _ an 800-pound
gorilla _ that the rest of the world is incapable of getting around
it?'' Eckart asked.
   Nintendo officials angrily charged they'd been ambushed by
Eckart and denied a chance to present their side to Congress.
   ``This guy is just grandstanding,'' said Howard C. Lincoln,
senior vice president of Nintendo, in Redmond, Wash.
   Eckart, chairman of the House Small Business subcommittee on
antitrust, accused Nintendo of intimidating retailers to keep
competitors' games off toy store shelves.
   He said Nintendo has used exclusive software arrangements and
physical computer-chip barriers to control the market, and that
Nintendo had created artificial shortages of some games.
   The result of Nintendo's marketing practices, he said, is that
only games licensed or sold by Nintendo can be played on the
Nintendo players _ thus blocking independent software publishers
and inflating the costs of games to consumers by 20 percent to 30
percent.
   ``Nintendo right now is saying you can buy our machines but you
can play only our games,'' Eckart said.
   Nintendo is the U.S. subsidiary of a Japanese manufacturer that
revived the domestic electronic game industry and now controls 80
percent of the $3.4 billion market.
   Eckart raised the issue less than three weeks before Christmas,
as parents of children all over the country are buying or looking
for popular Nintendo games. Some of the most popular, such as
``Super Mario Brothers,'' ``Simon's Quest'' and ``Double Dragon,''
were in short supply last Christmas, and shortages of other games
loom this year.
   The basic game unit costs $80 to $150, depending on accessories,
and game cartridges range in price from $40 to $60 each.
   By Nintendo's own estimate it will have its electronic
game-playing units in 20 percent of all U.S. households by the end
of 1989 _ some 20 million units. The percentage for households with
children aged 7 and up to mid-teens, the prime game-playing market,
is far higher.
   ``They have done a brilliant job in marketing their product, but
the simple fact remains that our subcommittee investigation has
revealed there is no competition among competitors,'' Eckart said.
   He wrote to James F. Rill, assistant attorney general and head
of the antitrust division of the Justice Department, asking for the
probe.
   He released his letter and described the investigation at a news
conference, where he told reporters his staff had two interviews
with Nintendo representatives.
   But in a telephone interview, Lincoln heatedly disputed that
claim and accused Eckart of ``an outright lie.'' He said Nintendo
only learned of the investigation ``on a rumor,'' and that Eckart
canceled a hearing where Nintendo was to speak.
   In presenting his case against Nintendo, Eckart credited the
company with reviving a moribund video game market with its product.
   But he compared Nintendo to AT&amp;T before the breakup of its
nationwide telephone monopoly, and to the producers of phonographs
50 years ago, when equipment was designed so that only a company's
own records had the uniquely shaped hole that would fit their
players.
   Eckart said Nintendo installs a ``lock-out chip,'' or patented
computer chip, in each cartridge so that only licensed game
cartridges including that chip can be used on Nintendo players. No
such chip is used by Nintendo in Japan, and competing game
companies do not use such a chip, he said.
   Lincoln said the chip was a security device blocking
counterfeit, pirated and poor-quality games.
   He charged that Eckart's probe was triggered by a complaint by a
rival company, Atari Games Corp., and its Tengen Inc. subsidiary.
Nintendo has a federal suit pending in San Francisco against
Atari-Tengen, alleging copyright theft and patent infringement.

   Major airlines are bumping fewer passengers
off assigned flights, the Transportation Department says.
   The latest Air Travel Consumer Report released Thursday showed
2.61 passengers for every 10,000 boardings were told they would
have to take another flight because of over booking during the
first nine months of the year.
   The rate for the same period last year was 3.02.
   Mishandled baggage reports against U.S. airlines declined, while
overall consumer complaints increased slightly in October, the
report said.
   The monthly report showed the nation's dozen largest airlines
operated on time 79.5 percent of the time in October, about the
same as in September.
   Mishandled baggage reports declined from 7.25 per 1,000
passengers in September to 6.98 in October.
   Consumer complaints totaled 1,143, compared with 1,104 a month
earlier.

   The gunman who roamed through the University of
Montreal's engineering school and killed 14 women carried a suicide
letter vowing to seek revenge on women for ruining his life, police
said Thursday.
   The killer _ identified by police Thursday night as Marc Lepine,
25, of Montreal _ also wounded nine women and four men before
killing himself Wednesday in the worst mass murder in Canadian
history.
   Police identified Lepine as a war-movie fanatic who ``was always
frustrated by women,'' said police spokesman Andre Tessier.
   Lepine had trouble developing relationships with women and broke
off all communication at the first sign of rejection, said police
spokesman Andre Tessier. Lepine had taken courses with the aim of
entering the engineering school, Tessier said.
   As he roamed through the modern, six-story engineering building
firing a rifle, Lepine ranted, ``I want the women!'' and ``You're
all a bunch of feminists! I hate feminists!'' witnesses told police.
   One of the wounded remained in critical but stable condition
Thursday. The rest were out of danger.
   A Montreal gun shop salesman, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Lepine bought the hunting rifle used in the
slayings on Nov. 21 for $510. The provincial gun permit was in the
name of Marc Lepine.
   Earlier, a broadcast report gave the name as Marc Lapin.
   The employee said Lepine bought a handgun there about two years
ago.
   ``He didn't appear to be any crazier than anyone else _
actually, he was a bit of a joker,'' he said.
   Police said Lepine, who was single and unemployed, was born in
Montreal to a Quebec mother and an Algerian father and was known as
Gamil Gharbi until age seven. His parents separated and he took his
mother's last name, Lepine, and the first name Marc.
   Senior police investigator Jacques Duchesneau told a news
conference Lepine ``had certain problems in relationships with
women. He was known to be always very gentle and courteous with
women until the relationship didn't go his way.
   ``He seemed to be very intelligent.''
   Duchesneau said Lepine ``was obsessed with war films and
electronics. He seemed to have no problems with alcohol or drugs.''
   In his letter, Lepine said he was committing a ``political act''
in killing the women because ``feminists had always ruined my
life,'' police reported.
   Duchesneau said Lepine used a .223-caliber Sturm Ruger
semi-automatic rifle.
   He also carried a hunting knife and sheath, two boxes of bullets
and a 30-bullet clip.
   He was described as about 5-foot-9 inches, weighing 160 pounds,
with brown hair and blue eyes.
   The gun shop employee said the firearm bought by Lepine was a
big seller, with hundreds sold in his store every year.
   Canada's gun control laws are generally stricter than those in
the United States.
   Duchesneau said ``it was quite clear'' that a three-page
handwritten letter signed ``Marc'' and found on Lepine's body was a
suicide note. He said it specified Dec. 6 as the date for Lepine's
death.
   He said it contained the names of 15 women that were believed
taken from a newspaper, but declined to elaborate except to say not
all were public figures.
   Duchesneau told reporters the letter said Lepine was seeking
revenge on women.
   ``He mentioned in the letter that he did that because of
political reasons. He said feminists kind of spoiled his life and
he hasn't been happy in life for the last seven years,'' the
officer said.
   ``I think he blamed women in general, saying that if his life
was ruined it was mainly because of women.''
   The letter also mentioned former army Cpl. Denis Lortie, jailed
for life after killing three people and wounding 13 in 1984 with
submachine-gun fire in the Quebec legislature.
   Duchesneau said Lepine identified himself as a student but did
not specify a school. He also said Lepine wrote that he was refused
for military induction because he ``wasn't a social person.''
   Duchesneau said Lepine ``was not very successful with certain
courses in his studies,'' and had few female friends.
   Police said 35 to 37 shots were fired.
   The school was crowded on the last day of classes before
examinations when the killer arrived at 4:30 p.m. EST.
   Police said he first shot a woman in a second-floor corridor,
then entered a room on that floor where a class with about 50 male
and 10 female students was in session.
   Witnesses said he told the class to separate by sex and sent the
men into the corridor before opening fire, killing six more women.
   ``It was just like Rambo. He had at least two ammunition belts
on his chest,'' said engineering student Robert Leclerc, who was in
the classroom.
   Leclerc, 23, said the killer told the women, ``You're all a
bunch of feminists. I hate feminists.''
   ``My friend, Nathalie, said, `No, it's not true. We're not
feminists.' He fired into the group,'' Leclerc said.
   Police said Lepine then went to the first floor where he killed
three women in a cafeteria, next entered a third-floor classroom
where he shot four women to death and then killed himself.
   The engineering school was closed Thursday in mourning.
   A temporary morgue was set up in the building so parents could
identify bodies.
   Pierre Leclair, head of public relations for Montreal police,
arrived at the school to find his daughter, Maryse, dead on the
floor.
   Montreal Mayor Jean Dore told reporters, with tears in his eyes,
that his babysitter was one of the women killed.
   A male student laid a wreath of roses in the snow outside the
engineering building Thursday morning. Someone left a poem mourning
the loss attached to a wall nearby.
   A candlelight vigil by about 2,000 people was held outside the
school Thursday night, but was marred by a scuffle when people on
the podium grappled for a megaphone used to address the crowd.

<HEAD>Group Says Colombia Most Dangerous for Rights Workers</HEAD>

   Colombia leads a list of countries in which
human rights activists were killed this year, and U.S. and
Colombian human rights leaders say the troubled country's
government shares the blame with its drug dealers.
   ``All the problems of human rights in Colombia are not due to
the drugs,'' Gustavo Gallon, director of the Colombian section of
the Andean Commission of Jurists, told reporters Thursday.
   Aryeh Neier, executive director of Human Rights Watch, said many
of the killings reflect ``alliances ... between drug dealers and
middle level military and police officials in parts of the
country.''
   Gallon and Neier spoke at a news conference at which the human
rights monitoring organization released a report showing 68
killings in 1989 of people who monitor human rights abuses in their
countries.
   Colombia topped the list with 24, followed by Brazil with 14
killings _ many of which, the report said, ``reflect the intense
struggle over land distribution in rural areas.''
   Gallon, speaking in Spanish with an interpreter, said, ``The
situation of human rights was already bad in Colombia long before
the drug problem existed. What has happened is that it has gotten
worse since.''
   Neier said, ``A large number of the killings do involve drug
dealers, but we also believe there have been alliances between drug
dealers and middle-level military and police officials in parts of
the country, and that a lot of theses killings reflect those
alliances.''
   The human rights official said he believed the government of
President Virgilio Barco ``is genuinely concerned about human
rights and is not itself, at least at the level of the president
and those associated with him, engaged in these kinds of killings
in any way.''
   ``But we want the Colombian government to act more firmly
against those within the armed forces and police forces in Colombia
who do have the alliances with the drug dealers,'' he said.
   The 345-page report discussed 1,200 cases of persecution of
human rights monitors in 72 countries, including arrest,
imprisonment and torture, killings and 10 unexplained
``disappearances.''
   South Africa topped the list in the total number of persecution
cases, taking up 36 pages.
   A South African human rights representative, Dean Simon
Farisani, said, ``While we appreciate at least the readiness of
(South African President F.W.) de Klerk not to throw police and
members of the defense force on our marching people, he had
absolutely no choice because those people continue to be involved
in a defiant campaign, defying the laws that have been imposed on
them.''
   Czechoslovakia, gripped by turmoil over reforms being sought by
a pro-democracy movement, was second in the number of cases of
persecution, taking up 23 pages.
   ``A substantial number of cases involve people who were released
from prison just a couple of weeks prior to publication of this
report,'' Neier said.
   ``The changes that have been taking place in Central and Eastern
Europe have had a significant effect,'' he said. However, he added,
``Not all of the persons we are concerned about in Czechoslovakia
have been released, so there is a way to go.''
   The report said all but five of the human rights killings
occurred in countries generally classified as democracies.
   Dictatorships, the report said, often ``don't have to engage in
killing because they very often suppress all activity of this sort
so firmly that no one has the opportunity to engage in human rights
monitoring,'' Neier said. ``It is when things open up some, but
don't open up all the way, that the greatest climate of danger
seems to prevail.''
   The New York-based Human Rights Watch is made up of five
regional committees: Africa Watch, Americas Watch, Asia Watch,
Helsinki Watch and Middle East.

   The peaceful revolution sweeping Czechoslovakia
brings many reminders of the euphoric ``Prague Spring'' that was
crushed by Soviet tanks 21 years ago.
   The excitement, the endless discussions, the hopes and the sweet
taste of freedom to challenge decades-old dogmas are there. But the
similarities are few and the differences are profound:
   The ``Prague Spring'' was born within the ruling Communist Party
after years of fermentation. The change in 1989 came from an
opposition group that mushroomed into a popular movement in a
matter of days.
   In 1968, no one called for deleting the constitutional guarantee
of the Communist Party's power monopoly. Now, that guarantee is
gone, after just 10 days of huge demonstrations against one-party
rule.
   There were no slogans in 1968 urging free elections. Now, that
call is on signs and posters throughout the nation.
   The ill-fated 1968 predecessor of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
perestroika had lofty aims to overcome what was then conceded to be
a ``deep crisis of society.''
   A 24,000-word party program included a long list of goals,
ranging from civil rights guarantees in a state of law to a
market-oriented economy. It was a vision of ``broadest democracy.''
   Criticism spread in a way that was then without precedent in any
Communist country. Generals criticized their chiefs of staff,
editors their publishers, government officials their ministers, and
ministers the head of state.
   It became known as ``socialism with a human face,'' and it was
the last real chance for communism to survive in a country where
the party won a 1947 election.
   But even the most outspoken critics of the party, the signers of
the famous ``2,000 words'' in June 1968, stressed that the
Communists had a vital function in the work for ``the common cause
that has the title `socialism.'''
   ``The leading role of the party was never in doubt then,'' says
Cestmir Cisar, a Central Committee secretary in 1968 and a chief
target of Moscow's criticism at the time. ``People trusted the
party.''
   But now, Cisar said, ``20 years of pseudo-socialism that have
since passed have made people lose their confidence.''
   ``The young people totally reject the word `Socialism.' They do
not want to hear it. And that is understandable because they have
never known any other form of socialism.''
   ``In 1968, the society was ready to accept our kind of
socialism,'' he added. ``This time the Communist Party has
completely lost its (leading) position.''
   Like Cisar, Libuse Silhanova was expelled from the Communist
Party in a large-scale 1970 purge. She lost her teaching job and
barely managed by knitting for a cooperative.
   A founding member of the Charter 77 civil rights group, she says
that 1989 cannot be compared with 1968.
   ``Except for the spontaneity and the euphoria among the people
in the street, there are no similarities,'' she said. ``And the
euphoria is greater now.''
   But so is the concern that the reforms may still fail again, she
made plain. ``In 1968, there was virtually no fear in
Czechoslovakia of interference from abroad,'' she said. ``People
were shocked when the Russians arrived.''
   Now, she says, there is continued fear that the pro-democracy
movement will be suppressed by hard-liners still firmly entrenched
in the party hierarchy.
   ``A relapse is still possible,,'' she cautioned. ``We know the
secret police and the state security. They are wicked and tricky.''

<HEAD>IRS Announces New Rules on Employee Expenses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New IRS rules will free employees from having
to deal with expense accounts on their tax returns.
   If the rules are followed to the letter, employers will not have
to withhold taxes from their workers' expense allowances.
   The new regulations, announced Thursday by the Internal Revenue
Service, ``are designed to avoid harsh results for employers who
have reasonable substantiation methods,'' said Mary Oppenhiemer,
the agency's deputy assistant chief counsel.
   Starting in 1990, an employer must require that employees
substantiate expenses and turn back any portion of an advance that
is not substantiated. If those two conditions are met, the employer
need not list any part of the expense reimbursement as income on
the worker's W-2 form and the worker will not have to claim a
deduction for the allowance.
   In that case, Ms. Oppenhiemer said, ``the only amounts that will
ever show up on the employee's Form W-2 are amounts the employee
does not substantiate or does not return to the employer.''
   If the worker does not substantiate expenses or does not return
any overage, that excess would be listed as income on the W-2. An
employee then might be able to take an itemized deduction for part
of the allowance.
   The regulations permit employers to rely on a ``good-faith
interpretation'' of the law in accounting for 1989 expenses.
   Ms. Oppenhiemer told reporters the new regulations are in line
with the agency's moves toward simplification.
   ``We believe that the regulations will not impose any
significant new administrative burden on most employers,'' she
said. In fact, she said, the changes ``will actually reduce
compliance burdens for many taxpayers.''
   The regulations also require that taxes be withheld from expense
allowances unless the substantiation and return-of-excess
procedures are followed. Current rules say withholding is not
required if the employer reasonably believes the allowances will be
used for business expenses.
   The tougher withholding rule will take effect July 1.
   The IRS also announced that the standard mileage rate for
business use of an automobile in 1990 will be 26 cents a mile, up
from 25{ cents this year.
   This marks the first time the IRS has disclosed this annual
adjustment in advance; the rate for a year is usually announced
about two months before the end of that year.
   For 1990 and later years, the business mileage rate will be 26
cents across the board; present rules permit the full rate only for
the first 15,000 miles and 11 cents for each additional mile.
   The IRS said employers will be deemed to have met substantiation
requirements if they use the 26-cent rate in reimbursing employees
for business use of their cars.
   The standard mileage rate for use of a personal car for
charitable activities will continue at 12 cents a mile next year.
The rate for purposes of calculating medical and moving expenses
will remain at 9 cents a mile.
   Another new procedure announced Thursday provides a simplified
``safe harbor'' option for employer reimbursements for employee
travel expenses.
   This will allow employers to use a rate of $122 per day for 28
high-cost areas and $85 per day for all other parts of the United
States.
   The high-cost areas: Death Valley, Los Angeles, Palm Springs,
San Francisco and Santa Barbara, Calif.; Aspen and Vail, Colo.; the
Washington, D.C., area; Atlanta; Chicago; Annapolis, Columbia and
Ocean City, Md.; Andover, Boston, Martha's Vineyard-Nantucket and
Plymouth, Mass.; Conway, N.H.;
   Atlantic City, Newark, Ocean City-Cape May and
Princeton-Trenton, N.J.; New York City and White Plains, N.Y.;
Philadelphia; Newport, R.I.; Hilton Head, S.C., and Dallas-Fort
Worth.

solution to the problem of brucellosis spreading from wild bison
and elk into cattle herds bordering Yellowstone National Park.
   A two-day meeting of scientists and others from the departments
of Agriculture and Interior was held here this week, but two senior
officials said in a joint interview Thursday that no one is close
to a decision on how to deal with the problem.
   Brucellosis of cattle has also been called Bang's disease and
infectious abortion. It can cause undulant fever in humans, usually
through unpasteurized milk or direct contact with infected animals.
   The Agriculture Department, in cooperation with state and local
governments, livestock associations and animal health groups, has
been striving for decades to eliminate the disease from commercial
herds.
   So far, according to USDA officials, 27 states are free of
brucellosis. Most of the remainder are in the South.
   The problem with bison, or American buffalo, and elk in the huge
Yellowstone National Park is that infected animals can roam onto
cattle rangelands, mingle with herds and thus spread the disease.
   ``While we're talking about a very small number of cattle and
bison and elk in the Yellowstone area, the potential threat can
extend over a much wider area,'' said John Dennis of the National
Park Service.
   Cattle, of course, greatly outnumber bison in the United States.
There are nearly 100 million head of cattle, compared with an
estimated 500,000 bison, including public and private herds.
Yellowstone has around 2,000 head.
   But prospective buyers and shippers of breeding cattle can be
highly wary of animals from known areas of brucellosis infection.
That is true on the growing international market for livestock as
well as domestically, Dennis said.
   ``It's a lot easier to do that interchange if everybody is in
the same status on brucellosis,'' he said. ``Some countries may not
even accept cattle from (the United States) if we have pockets of
brucellosis.''
   John Kopec of USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service
said that there is much to learn about brucellosis in Yellowstone.
   ``We don't know absolutely that this disease may have come from
infected elk and _ in one case _ maybe some bison running around,''
he said. ``We don't know this unequivocally. But we have more or
less ruled out all the other sources.''
   Kopec said that since the early 1960s there have six outbreaks
of brucellosis among cattle in the Yellowstone area in which
infection from other cattle has been ruled out. The most recent was
in February after the disease was detected in an Idaho packing
plant and the slaughtered animal traced to Wyoming.
   The owner of the exposed cattle decided to liquidate the herd,
sending older cattle to slaughter and younger animals to a
quarantined feedlot and subsequently to slaughter.
   Kopec said that one of the problems in the Yellowstone area is
that ``we haven't unequivocally answered the question'' whether
bison and elk in the park have carried the disease over many
centuries or whether it is more recent.
   Meanwhile, he said, the cattle industry is putting pressure on
federal and state authorities to help safeguard commercial herds
against the ``potential threat'' of brucellosis from wild creatures.
   Kopec and Dennis said more experiments and study are needed. The
answers will come slowly.
   ``We may be talking years,'' Kopec said. ``It's not something
that will be done overnight.''

   The Agriculture Department says the Soviet
Union has bought 410,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized
prices for delivery in 1989-90, the seventh year of a long-term
grain supply agreement.
   F. Paul Dickerson, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said Thursday that shipments are
scheduled in January and February.
   The wheat was sold under the department's Export Enhancement
Program, or EEP, which provides subsidies to exporters selling U.S.
commodities to designated foreign markets.
   Dickerson said only 14,200 tons of wheat remain in the Soviet
Union's current EEP allocation of 1.5 million tons announced May 2.
   It was the second U.S. wheat sale since the seventh year of the
long-term grain agreement began Oct. 1, although more than 10.3
million tons of corn have been sold for 1989-90 delivery, along
with soybeans and soybean meal. A sale of 215,000 tons was reported
Monday.
   The pact runs through Dec. 31, 1990, and a new agreement is
being negotiated.
   In 1988-89, the sixth year of the current agreement, the Soviet
Union bought about 5.4 million tons of wheat and more than 16.3
million tons of corn, plus soybeans, soybean meal and grain
sorghums.
   A metric ton is 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels of
wheat. The 410,000 tons are equal to more than 15 million bushels
worth about $57 million at recent U.S. farm prices.
   Dickerson reported the subsidies at an average of $16.81 per
ton, or about 46 cents per bushel.
   The EEP arrangement allows private exporters to sell wheat and
other designated commodities to specified countries at reduced
prices to meet foreign competition. The exporters then collect free
government surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses, or
subsidies.
   Dickerson said the wheat was sold by Alfred C. Toepfer
International Inc., 150,000 tons; Louis Dreyfus Corp., 135,000;
Cargill Inc., 50,000; Continental Grain Co., 25,000; J. Aron &amp; Co.,
25,000; and Mitsubishi International Corp., 25,000.

<HEAD>Education Goals Beginning to Take Shape</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton says the nation's
desire to reduce the school dropout rate shows how tough it will be
to set performance goals for education.
   ``Suppose you want the dropout rate to be at 9 percent, rather
than the 25 percent rate it is now,'' Clinton said in an interview.
``Three states already have that. There's nothing for them to do if
that's our goal, unless we decide that (the states) have the
capacity to go down to six and other states will never get below 20
percent.''
   ``See, there are a lot of complicated questions like that that
have to be answered. But first we have to get a national goal and
then we'll decide how to meet it. That's how we got to the moon.
That's how we won World War II. That's how you do things that are
big.''
   Clinton and South Carolina Gov. Carroll Campbell Jr. headed a
meeting Thursday of the National Governors' Association Task Force
on Education, which is preparing national performance goals for
education as decided at the education summit called by President
Bush in late September.
   The task force plans to recommend goals to the governors at
their winter meeting in February 1990. Once goals are approved, the
governors will focus on developing strategies for reaching the
targets tackling the rest of the agenda set at the summit,
including greater flexibility and enhanced accountability in the
use of federal resources.
   According to Clinton, the nation's educational system will be
measured by the goals every year, beginning in 1991, for a decade
to determine if learning improves in America.
   Task force members, joined by administration officials, heard a
variety of suggestions from educators, advocacy groups and business
leaders on what those goals should be.
   Generally, the group agreed the nation's education system should
focus on what children actually know as they complete each level of
schooling, rather than on the courses that are being offered.
Another key focus, the group said, should be on making sure
youngsters enter school healthy and able to learn.
   ``The goals should focus on the ends rather than the means,''
said Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos. ``We need a handful of
goals, clearly spelled out. Goals that can lead us in the direction
of guaranteeing action, measuring that action and at the same time
guaranteeing accountability.''
   Administration officials bristled at one suggestion that all
high school seniors should be required to pass ``leaving exams''
with standards set up by what a task force adviser called a
``quasi-governmental institution.''
   ``I have not heard from anyone _ from the governors, from
administration officials since we gave been discussing this for
several months now _ the desire or the interest in nationalizing or
federalizing our education system,'' said Roger Porter, White House
domestic policy adviser.
   However, Porter did agree educators must more accurately measure
what students have learned when they leave school.
   Chester Finn, a former Education Department official now at
Vanderbilt University, stressed the national goals focus on only
three areas: getting youngsters ready for school, preparing
adolescents for high school and making sure high school students
are ready for adulthood.
   ``If we can alter the behavior of tens of millions of people as
a consequence of having these goals, then this might be worth
doing,'' said Finn.
   NGA President Terry Branstad, governor of Iowa, agreed the list
of national goals should be short so every school district and
school can design their own specialized strategies.

   The Ku Klux Klan's offer to join
protesters at an abortion clinic Saturday has angered the group's
leader who contends ``they're only concerned about white babies
being killed.''
   ``Their robes and hoods, which represent a long history of hate
and violence, will only draw attention away from the real issue,''
said Rick Horton, president of the Tarrant County Pro-Life Action
Network.
   Horton rescheduled his group's demonstration to avoid picketing
alongside the Klan, drawing the wrath of Bill Walton, Grand Dragon
of Texas' Invisible Empire, Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.
   ``It's just like them to always run,'' Walton said. ``The
anti-abortion movement needs all the help, all the bodies it can
get. They're in no position to pick and choose their fellow
protesters.''
   But Horton characterized the KKK's plan to picket the West Side
Clinic in this Dallas suburb as ``probably nothing more than a
publicity stunt.''
   Horton said he was dumbfounded when Walton called to say the KKK
would join the picket.
   ``The grand dragon told me, `If there were no white babies being
aborted, we wouldn't be at the clinic,''' Horton said. ``The KKK
aren't pro-life. They're pro-life for the white race. They're only
concerned about white babies being killed.''
   Walton countered: ``We're against abortion of any race, period.
It doesn't matter if it's black, white, green, yellow, whatever _
that's murder. And murder doesn't discriminate.''
   Walton said he had hoped to picket alongside Horton's group with
about a dozen other KKK members ``because they could use the
attention. When the Klan comes out, the media come with us. That
guy needs numbers.''
   Joan Echols, spokeswoman for the Dallas Abortion Rights
Education League, an umbrella organization for supporters of
legalized abortion, said the anti-abortion organization and the
Klan were in cahoots ``just by scheduling their protests at
different times.''
   She charged the groups were ``all cut from the same cloth.''
   The Pro-life Action Network is scheduled to march for two hours
starting at 8 a.m., followed by the KKK, which will march from 10
a.m. to noon.
   Bob Salinas, acting director of public safety in White
Settlement, said patrols would not be increased Saturday, but
police would monitor the pickets.
   Horton also said he believes the KKK chose to picket the West
Side Clinic because its employees include a black and a Jewish
doctor, both of whom ``fall onto the Klan hate list.''
   Walton said the decision was based simply on ``finding one that
was open on Saturday.''
   But Walton said the Klan may have another problem if
temperatures drop.
   ``Them robes aren't made for cold weather,'' he said.

<HEAD>`Sky-Sky-Sky-Sky-SkyPager': Paging Service not Amused by Rap Hit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   SkyPager is mentioned in a rap music hit,
but the owner of the nationwide paging service believes it's
off-beat publicity.
   Skypager service, owned by Mobile Telecommunication Technologies
Corp. of Jackson, is the theme of a popular rap song by Sir
Mix-a-lot, a Seattle band.
   Mtel officials have considered suing over the rap hit, citing
possible damage to SkyPager's marketing efforts aimed at
professionals.
   ``It's a delicate situation. We did not authorize anything
that's on there,'' said James Phillips, president of SkyTel Corp.,
Mtel's satellite paging subsidiary.
   The song, ``Beepers,'' is written by band leader Anthony Ray of
Seattle (alias Sir Mix-a-lot).
   Ray and another band member use SkyPager, which allows them to
call a toll-free number to page each other in most U.S. cities. The
service, geared to traveling executives, uses a satellite signal.
   A few lyrics from ``Beepers'':
   ``SkyPager. Looks like a phaser. That's the attire of a
Northwest player. ... How does Mix-a-lot communicate? With beepers,
baby. Beepers.''
   The song gives the service's toll-free telephone number and
repeats a part of the computer-synthesized message that callers
hear when they page Skypager clients.
   ``Welcome to SkyPager. To use SkyPager, press the pound key
after each entry. Please enter the pin number you wish.
   ``SkyPager. SkyPager. SkyPager. Sky-Sky-Sky-Sky-SkyPager.''
   ``That song certainly doesn't suggest the normal use of our
product,'' Phillips said. ``We don't know if we'll take any action
or not. We're friends of the music industry, and we want to stay
friends.''
   The Jackson company has a number of music industry customers,
including Stevie Wonder and Barbra Streisand.
   Band manager Larry Serrin of Artist Management Inc. said the
SkyPager name and voice is readily available to the public.
   ``It's pretty much public domain,'' he said. ``If anything else,
it's promoting SkyPagers.''
   A SkyPager customer alerted Mtel to the song a few weeks ago.
   So far, Phillips hasn't noticed much impact on business from the
song, except for increased calls to SkyPager's service center.
   ``I can't say much for the lyrics, but it's a good sound,'' he
said. ``Hopefully, people will just listen to the music.''

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government billed the fight
between Roberto Duran and Sugar Ray Leonard as a political battle
with the United States, using it to drum up support for Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega.
   Government news media predicted it would be a night to celebrate
a triumph over imperialism. But Leonard spoiled the party in Las
Vegas Thursday night with an easy 12-round decision over Panama's
native son.
   ``With this defeat, what we have is a night like a tomb,'' said
one of the few people on the street after the fight.
   ``It is clear as water,'' another fan said. ``He lost. Sugar Ray
is a better boxer.''
   The government, in a sense, was the only winner in Panama.
Because of U.S. economic sanctions against Panama, television
transmission rights were sold only for transmission by a private
station that serves only Panama City and Colon.
   But just hours before the fight, the government ordered
television stations into a nationwide hookup, forcing the private
station that had the rights to share the signal with the government
station.
   Early in the evening, people gathered at homes or set up large
television screens on sidewalks and lined up beer coolers in
preparation for the fiesta to celebrate a Duran victory.
   In El Chorrillo, a slum near the entrance to the Panama Canal
where Duran was born and ran barefoot as a child, hundreds gathered
to watch the fight on a large television screen perched on a
flatbed truck.
   Loud music played for hours before the fight and fans danced in
the streets.
   ``This is more than just a fight,'' said national assemblyman
Luis Esquivel. He said the Noriega's Defense Forces, which give him
the clout to control the nation, had provided the screen.
   ``We are trying to develop our sense of nationalism,'' he said.
``Even if Duran loses, this will be an affirmation of our
nationality in the face of U.S. aggression.''
   Fans stood and sang the national anthem before the fight and
then cheered in the first few rounds. By the sixth round it was
clear victory celebrations were off.
   ``He is tied up,'' said a fan of Duran, who, at 38, appeared
slow in trying to get close to Leonard.
   As the last round ended, a woman picked up her chair, and said
dejectedly: ``Well, it's over.''
   ``But life goes on,'' she added, turning to a companion. After
all, if there wasn't a Duran victory to celebrate, there was
something else.
   A few minutes later, as music started playing again, the woman
was dancing in the street. It was just after midnight, and Panama's
Mother's Day had begun.

   He was harassed, reviled and often
imprisoned for challenging the Communist government. Now, dissident
playwright Vaclav Havel says he is willing to become president.
   Havel, a banned playwright and leader of the opposition movement
that has brought the hard-line government to its knees, has
repeatedly declined political office.
   But, when asked again Thursday if he would accept the presidency
if it was offered, he said he would.
   ``I have repeatedly said that my occupation is a writer and that
I have no political ambitions. I don't feel myself to be a
professional politician, but have always put the public interest
ahead of my own,'' he told a crowded news conference in the Laterna
Magika theater.
   ``And, if God help us, the situation should develop in such a
way that the only service I could render my country would be to do
this, then, of course, I would do it,'' Havel said.
   He stressed that nobody is pushing his candidacy and that he
only would assume the presidency if this was the only way out of
the standoff between the beleaguered government and the
increasingly powerful opposition movement.
   ``The more democratic and more normal the condition in our
country, the less my role will be,'' the mustachioed, blond
playwright said.
   Havel has avoided interviews in the past two hectic weeks that
have seen his opposition group, the Civic Forum, direct a movement
that has forced the Communists to relinquish their 41-year monopoly
on power, ousted most hard-line leaders and paved the way for a
coalition government that could restore democracy.
   ``If I continually commented on the revolution, I could not have
participated in it,'' he said.
   He characterized events so far as a ``cultural revolution'' that
began as a student protest against police violence on Nov. 17 and
mushroomed into a movement that may return Czechoslovakia to its
democratic, humanistic traditions.
   ``What is important is what the students began with, that is,
the humanitarian dimension, resistance to violence, the longing for
truth and moral integrity,'' said Havel. His current role follows a
long tradition of Czech intellectuals doubling as political leaders.
   As a founder member of Charter 77, eastern Europe's oldest human
rights movement, Havel has spent most of the last 13 years under
police surveillance and served 4{ years in jail for his activism.
   Havel said the main aim of Civic Forum is to see the country
enjoy free elections soon, but he stressed that Czechoslovakia
should not necessarily return to its same prewar system of
capitalist democracy.
   Now, ``a modern contemporary government should design a modern
contemporary system which would return to people their honor and
freedom,'' Havel said.
   In this struggle, he said, naming the right prime minister ``is
more important than 10 presidents,'' whose role as head of state is
largely ceremonial.
   Havel said he would like to see Jan Carnogursky, a Slovak
dissident who is a lawyer and a respected Roman Catholic activist,
as premier.
   Civic Forum is pushing Carnogursky as a first deputy premier to
the Communist premier named Thursday, Marian Calfa, another Slovak.
   By tradition, if the premier is Slovak, Czechoslovakia's
president is a Czech.
   The incumbent president, Gustav Husak, is a Slovak who is
regarded as one of the Communists most responsible for the
crackdown on reform after the Warsaw Pact invasion that crushed the
``Prague Spring'' in 1968.
   Civic Forum said Thursday it wants as president a Czech who is
not a member of any political party and ``not connected in any way
with the current structures of government.''
   Havel? The playwright-turned-politician was presidentially
diplomatic.
   ``You don't accept the basic presidential quality of answering
in a roundabout way,'' he joked. ``I have heard news conferences by
President Bush and I've heard him give evasive answers and say `No
comment.' I so far have not said, `No comment.'''

<TEXT>
   The volatile mixture of art and commerce has
erupted in a multimillion-dollar lawsuit filed by a collector
against a scholar and the venerable Metropolitan Museum of Art in
New York.
   The man in the middle: American artist John La Farge, a muralist
and stained glass maker who lived from 1835 to 1910.
   La Farge decorated the palaces of New York's gilded age and
public buildings nationwide. He invented the opalescent glass
widely commercialized by Tiffany.
   His works are selling for up to hundreds of thousands of dollars.
   The vagaries of assigning a monetary value to his individual
creative works are at the center of the lawsuit filed in federal
court here by Sean M. McNally. He's a collector and former Goldman
Sachs investment banker who devotes his time to studying and
dealing in La Farge works.
   McNally claims he's the victim of professional jealousy, while a
lawyer for La Farge scholar James Yarnall of Washington charges
that the lawsuit challenges the integrity of art scholarship.
   Others are concerned the real loser may be La Farge.
   ``La Farge is too great an artist to be cast around in the
gutter this way,'' says William Vareika, a Newport, R.I., gallery
owner.
   The lawsuit claims Yarnall, who is preparing a catalogue of La
Farge's works, engaged in a campaign to undermine the value of
McNally's collection and disparage his expertise on the artist. The
Met allegedly stood by Yarnall despite knowing he was wrong.
   Yarnall's lawyer, Peter R. Stern, called the lawsuit the case of
an art speculator against an art scholar.
   ``I think that this case represents a serious attack on all art
scholarship and history,'' said Stern.
   Met spokesman John Ross said McNally's claims are ``without
basis.'' He said Yarnall was an independent contractor who was
mistakenly listed in the museum's annual report as a staff member.
   According to McNally's court papers, the seeds of the dispute
were sown in February 1988 when McNally appraised a La Farge piece
called ``Moon Window'' for a private collector at $20,000.
   Yarnall told Met benefactor Richard M. Schwartz that ``Moon
Window'' was worth $200,000, the lawsuit said. Schwartz bought the
work for $165,000 a month later.
   In April, its companion piece sold at auction for $14,200.
   That sale showed Yarnall's appraisal to be inaccurate and set
him on his course to ``denigrate and diminish'' both McNally's
collection and his professional reputation, the lawsuit alleged.
   ``People get jealous,'' said McNally's attorney, Christopher W.
Hyde.
   According to the lawsuit, an example of this was when Yarnall
later told Schwartz in the presence of Met officials that a McNally
window was unimportant, badly restored and not worth the $150,000
Schwartz was ready to pay for it. That appraisal sank the deal.
   Then in June, Yarnall allegedly told Vareika, who was exhibiting
McNally's La Farge works, that one of McNally's windows was not
authentic.
   The lawsuit, filed Nov. 28, has slander, libel and contract
interference claims and seeks at least $28 million in punitive and
other damages.
   La Farge scholarship is particularly competitive because most of
the material about him has remained with descendants, said Henry
Adams, a La Farge expert and American art curator at the
Nelson-Atkins Museum in Kansas City.
   And the La Farge market is particularly difficult to evaluate
because of the broad range of quality and media in his work, Adams
said.
   Museums are put in a difficult position when asked to give
appraisals, said Ulysses Dietz, curator of decorative arts at the
Newark Museum.
   ``It's a real clash between the function of a museum and the
function of a marketplace,'' Dietz said, particularly when donors
of works are seeking tax deductions for their largesse.
   But lawsuits such as the one filed by McNally could have a
``very chilling effect on a museum's desire to help spread
information,'' he said. ``It's what every museum lives in constant
fear of.''

<TEXT>
   On Oct. 18, 1988, more than 30 family members
or business associates of controversial savings and loan figure
Charles H. Keating Jr. contributed $1,000 each to then-Sen. Chic
Hecht's re-election campaign.
   The Federal Election Commission _ which puts strict
$1,000-per-person limits on contributions to an election campaign _
is investigating whether such multiple contributions were handled
illegally, agency spokesman Scott Moxley said Thursday.
   The FEC acted at the request of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a
recipient of Keating's largess who asked the agency Oct. 30 whether
there was ``potentially illegal action'' by Keating's
``corporations and contributors.''
   McCain's request only referred to the Keating-related donations
he received, but Moxley said the agency can decide to expand the
probe to contributions to other members of Congress. He would not
say whether the FEC has done so.
   Keating and his associates and family members followed the
pattern of multiple donations during a campaign _ often on the same
day _ with a number of lawmakers as he admittedly sought to
increase his influence with Congress.
   Spokesmen for Keating did not return several telephone calls
seeking reaction on the FEC probe.
   Among Keating's contributions during the 1980s were $1.3 million
to the campaigns and causes of five senators: McCain and Democrats
Alan Cranston of California, the majority whip; Banking Committee
Chairman Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan; Governmental Affairs
Committee Chairman John Glenn of Ohio and Dennis DeConcini of
Arizona.
   The five intervened on Keating's behalf with federal banking
regulators in April 1987 when his Lincoln Savings and Loan, of
Irvine, Calif., was collapsing.
   The Senate ethics committee is trying to determine whether there
was a connection between the intervention and the donations.
   Now taken over by the federal government, the expected $2
billion-plus cost of protecting Lincoln's depositors should make
this the most expensive thrift failure in the nation's history.
   Federal election law prohibits anyone from making a donation on
behalf of someone else. For instance, a corporate chief could not
have employees give $1,000 under their names and reimburse them to
skirt the donation limit.
   Moxley said the law is unclear on whether someone could
orchestrate contributions by employees with no promise of
reimbursement.
   The Associated Press requested an FEC check of campaign
contributions made on specific days by Keating, his immediate
family members and business associates. The dates were chosen at
random.
   The agency computer found:
   _More than 30 separate $1,000 donations went from Keating
associates or family members to the general election campaign of
then-Sen. Chic Hecht, R-Nev. on Oct. 18, 1988.
   _On April 9, 1988, Keating and five associates contributed to
the primary campaign of Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah. The same day,
Keating, his wife and two others gave to Hatch's general election
campaign.
   _On March 11, 1987, there were nearly 20 Keating-related
contributions to the primary campaign of Riegle and seven to his
general election campaign; and even more multiple donations the
same day. Many of the contributions could have been tickets to a
dinner for Riegle on March 23 at a Keating property, the
Ponchartrain Hotel in Detroit. The $1,000 per-person limit applies
to such events.
   _Sen. Timothy Wirth, a member of the Senate Banking Committee,
received four $1,000 donations on Feb. 13, 1987 for his general
election campaign.
   _DeConcini received two donations to his general election
campaign and four to his primary campaign on Oct. 29, 1987.
   McCain received $112,000 in campaign contributions from Keating
and associates, and promised to ``promptly refund'' any money the
FEC finds was given improperly. He previously announced he was
reimbursing American Continental Corp., the parent company of
Lincoln, $13,433 for flights the senator and his family took aboard
Keating's corporate plane to and from the Bahamas in 1984-86.
   DeConcini received $48,100 for his 1988 re-election campaign but
announced he was returning the money.
   Cranston received $39,000 in campaign money. He solicited from
Keating $850,000 for three voter education projects in California
and $85,000 for the California Democratic Party.
   Glenn received $34,000 in direct contributions and a political
action committee associated with him was given $200,000.
   Riegle received $76,100 for his 1988 re-election campaign but
announced he was returning the money.

<HEAD>Cheney Gets $292 Billion To Spend in 1991</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and top aides
are ``crunching the numbers'' to meet White House demands the
Pentagon hold its spending to around $292 billion during the next
fiscal year.
   The White House, in its attempt to meet the Gramm-Rudman budget
cutting targets, has informed Cheney that military spending won't
be allowed to keep pace with inflation, Pentagon sources say.
   ``It's going to be a net reduction in real growth,'' meaning an
increase in actual spending of less than the expected inflation
rate of 4.1 percent, said a defense source, who spoke on condition
he not be identified by name.
   ``They're crunching the numbers,'' said another senior Pentagon
official, indicating Cheney and his aides now must draw up plans to
deal with the amount of funding the White House will allow.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams told reporters on Wednesday
that Cheney received a figure a day earlier from the White House,
but he declined to discuss it.
   The spokesman said the department now must make plans to conform
with the new figure for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, 1990 so
it may be included in the formal presentation of the president's
budget to Congress next month.
   He said Cheney is determined to send ``a realistic budget'' to
Congress.
   Cheney himself has said he does not want his budget labeled
``dead on arrival'' because it contained unrealistic expectations
of increased spending.
   The debate over the 1991 fiscal year's budget comes as the
Pentagon attempts to grapple with near-certain cuts over the long
term in light of eased tensions abroad and budget-deficit problems
at home.
   Cheney has ordered the service chiefs to come up with plans that
could allow up to $180 billion to be trimmed from future projected
budgets in the years 1992 through 1994.
   But House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis.,
says the Bush administration bungled its announcement of future
cuts in defense spending by failing to spell out a military
strategy, leaving planners with a dollar figure target but no
guidance on policy.
   ``The budget exercise asked the services where they would cut.
It didn't tell them what threats to assume, what roles to emphasize
or what missions to minimize,'' Aspin said in a speech Thursday.
   Aspin said the cuts Cheney has discussed with reporters are
based on unrealistic budget projections.
   Under the last budget put out by the Reagan administration,
projected military outlays for fiscal 1991 were estimated at $304.7
billion.
   In the budget for the present fiscal year, Pentagon
appropriations set by Congress were $286 billion. An increase to
$292 billion would be 2.1 percent, though the $286 billion figure
is not final.
   The administration expects inflation to be 4.1 percent through
1990.
   The actual amount the department will spend will affect the
government's 1991 deficit, which must meet the Gramm-Rudman target
of $64 billion. For the current fiscal year, the deficit target
will range between $100 billion and $105 billion.
   Meanwhile, Air Force Secretary Donald Rice indicated budget
pressures may force the service to stretch out purchases of the
costly B-2 stealth bomber.
   The Pentagon has invested about $23 billion in the program and
hopes to purchase 132 bombers at a cost of about $70 billion. But
lawmakers profess ``sticker shock'' over the price tag _ estimated
at $530 million for each plane.
   The secretary told reporters he believes all 132 planes are
necessary and the bomber is an essential part of the Pentagon's
plans for nuclear deterrence, even if arms control agreements are
reached with the Soviet Union in the coming year on conventional
and strategic nuclear weapons.
   ``We are .. looking at the option of procuring it over a longer
period of time. ... We're interested in doing that only if it can
still be done efficiently,'' Rice said.
   ``I think 132 is a good number and if it were to be questioned,
it is something that doesn't need to be decided for quite a few
years to come,'' he added.
   In July, Air Force officials told congressmen that stretching
out purchases over several years could raise the aircraft's price
considerably.

   The English National Opera, hoping to dazzle the
senses of its audiences, has added something new to the sights and
sounds of its latest production _ smells.
   Opera buffs who turn out for Serge Prokofiev's ``The Love of
Three Oranges'' get a little scratch-and-sniff card with six
different odors of varying degrees of pleasantness.
   A kitchen scene offers the smell of rotten meat. Another is the
aroma of orange blossoms, and another the fragrance of exotic
perfume.
   When a foul-breathed demon appears, audience members scratch a
section that smells a bit like a cross between rotten eggs and,
well, body odor.
   An opening-night audience of 2,400 got their first whiff of the
show on Wednesday. The chorus signaled to the audience which
numbered square to scratch and when.
   The opera company says the scratch-and-sniff cards would be used
for 10 additional performances.
   However, there are no plans to use the technique for any operas
other than ``Three Oranges,'' a Russian opera that tells the tale
of a prince who is in love with an orange that turns into a
princess.

<HEAD>Lewis Company to Put $1.15 Million in Escrow in SEC Settlement</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   S.B. Lewis &amp; Co. will withdraw as a registered
securities broker-dealer and put as much as $1.15 million in escrow
to settle Securities and Exchange Commission charges.
   The funds belong to managing partner Salim B. ``Sandy'' Lewis,
one of Wall Street's best-known figures, who pleaded guilty to
stock manipulation and related charges. The company pleaded guilty
Aug. 30 in New York to two felony securities law violations at the
same time.
   The firm's agreement to withdraw as a broker-dealer within 90
days was part of a settlement of an administrative action Lewis &amp;
Co. reached Thursday with the SEC.
   The case against Lewis stemmed indirectly from the Ivan Boesky
insider trading scandals. Lewis' attorney, Stanley S. Arkin, said
that while the company has reached a settlement with the SEC, ``Mr.
Lewis has not.''
   Arkin declined to comment on negotiations between Lewis and the
SEC.
   Vincent DiBlasi, attorney for the company, was not in his
Manhattan office when called for comment Thursday evening.
   Under the terms of its settlement with the SEC, Lewis &amp; Co.,
registered with the SEC since 1980, will ``cease operation as a
broker-dealer.''
   According to SEC documents, the company is ``in the process of
liquidation.''
   Also as part of the agreement, Lewis &amp; Co. will place any money
it has that is due Salim B. Lewis _ up to $1.15 million _ in escrow
until all matters between the SEC, Lewis and the firm ``have been
finally resolved.''
   The company also will place in escrow an amount equal to the
interest on $1.15 million from May 9, 1986 _ when Lewis's illegal
activities began _ until Thursday under the same conditions. The
SEC did not specify how much that would be.
   Lewis pleaded guilty in Manhattan federal court to charges of
manipulating the price of Fireman's Fund common stock three years
ago, aiding and abetting the falsification of records and
stock-margin violations.
   The three felony charges against him carry a total maximum
15-year prison term and $2.75 million in fines. He is scheduled to
be sentenced Dec. 15.
   Lewis and his brokerage firm were named in a 22-count federal
indictment in November 1988 that claimed he manipulated Fireman's
Fund stock price just before American Express Co. announced the
sale of Fireman's Fund shares in 1986.
   Charges against Lewis stemmed from a 1987 guilty plea of Boyd
Jefferies, former head of the Los Angeles brokerage firm Jefferies
&amp; Co. who turned state's evidence. Jefferies had been implicated by
Boesky, the now imprisoned speculator who settled insider trading
charges in November 1986.

<BYLINE>Ex-Agent Recalls Soviet Woman Who Was His Lover; Says He's No Spy
^By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``She was charming, outgoing, vivacious and
her English was atrocious,'' ex-FBI agent Richard Miller recalled
of the Soviet woman who became his lover and led to his conviction
as a spy.
   After five years in prison and reversal of his conviction,
Miller conceded his affair with Svetlana Ogorodnikov was ``the
stupidest thing I've done in my life,'' but insisted he never was a
spy.
   ``I love my country,'' said Miller, the only FBI agent ever
convicted of espionage. ``I'm a patriotic kind of guy. ... I know
in my heart I'm not a traitor.''
   The 52-year-old Miller, released on bail last month pending a
new trial, talked Thursday with a group of reporters who had sought
interviews. His lawyers, Stanley Greenberg and Joel Levine, stood
by to veto any questions about his planned defense. But Miller
openly answered most queries.
   Asked to describe the proudest moment in his FBI career, Miller
thought for a few minutes, then cited a 1972 trip to Washington,
when he and his family had a picture taken with then FBI chief J.
Edgar Hoover.
   ``That,'' he said, ``was one of the proudest moments.''
   The former agent was alternately serious and wise-cracking. He
called his upcoming third trial, ``Miller Three. It makes me feel
like Rambo.''
   He spoke of his troubled 20-year FBI career, his extramarital
affair with Mrs. Ogorodnikov, his return to the Mormon faith and
adjustment to life outside prison.
   ``In prison a person loses one of the most precious things a
person can lose and that is freedom of choice. They tell you when
to sleep, when to eat, when to do laundry. I'm having a difficult
time adjusting to making simple decisions.''
   His first trial ended in a jury deadlock. At his second trial in
1986, he was convicted of giving his lover a secret FBI reporting
guide in return for sex, money and gold.
   His attorneys claim he was a bumbler trying to redeem his
lackluster career by infiltrating the KGB through Mrs. Ogorodnikov,
a Soviet emigre. Miller still contends that was his misguided
purpose.
   ``A lot of the time I was a good FBI agent. One of the
exceptions was the stupid, idiotic thing I tried to do with
Svetlana. It was one of the stupidest things I've done. In fact, it
was the stupidest thing I've done in my life.''
   Mrs. Ogorodnikov and her husband, Nikolay, pleaded guilty to
conspiracy to commit espionage and are serving prison terms.
   ``As far as Svetlana goes, I'm very sad that she has to spend
time in prison and I wish her the very best as I would any person
who was in prison,'' Miller said.
   He said that his sexual indiscretions with Mrs. Ogorodnikov and
other women wrecked his career and his marriage.
   ``I probably have more guilt over that than any single thing,''
he said. ``I've always tried to be a very moral person and having
five affairs in two years is not very moral. ... I guess I got
caught up in the sexual revolution of the '80s.''
   Of his ex-wife, Paula, mother of his eight children, he said:
``I felt I betrayed her.''
   But they remain on good terms and he hopes to get permission to
spend Christmas with her and the children at her home in Utah.
   Miller was excommunicated from his Mormon faith for extramarital
affairs. But he said he abides by its precepts.
   In April, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned
Miller's conviction on grounds the jury should not have been told
Miller failed lie detector tests.
   He has a new judge and a trial scheduled for May.

<HEAD>Federal S&amp;L Probe Includes Thrift Tied to President's Son</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Loan and junk bond transactions among a group
of savings institutions _ including a Colorado thrift associated
with President Bush's son _ are being examined by federal
authorities for possible improprieties.
   S&amp;L regulator M. Danny Wall confirmed to reporters Thursday that
the Office of Thrift Supervision was continuing to look at several
thrifts which shuffled junk bonds and loans among themselves.
   Such ``daisy chains'' have been used by S&amp;Ls to hide
questionable credits from regulators.
   The transactions under scrutiny involved Lincoln Savings and
Loan Association, Irvine, Calif.; Silverado Banking, Savings and
Loan Association, Denver; San Jacinto Savings Association,
Bellaire, Texas; and MDC Holdings, a real estate investment company
affiliated with Silverado.
   Neil Bush, the president's 34-year-old son, served on the board
of directors of Silverado from 1985 until August 1988, four months
before regulators declared the S&amp;L insolvent.
   The relationship among the institutions raised concern among
regulators earlier in 1988, according to letters released by the
House Banking Committee.
   George Barclay, principal supervisory agent at the Federal Home
Loan Bank of Dallas, wrote to Washington regulators in September
1988 citing the ``apparent unhealthy lending relationship'' among
the institutions and MDC Holdings.
   In an October 1988 response to Barclay, Darrel W. Dochow,
regulatory director of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, wrote:
``Please be assured we are very concerned about the pattern of
activity that we have witnessed between San Jacinto, Lincoln,
Silverado and MDC.'' He indicated the Securities and Exchange
Commission was investigating MDC.
   Federal authorities are also investigating whether seven
thrifts, including Lincoln, Silverado and San Jacinto, inflated
their assets by selling junk bonds to each other at inflated
prices, according to American Banker, a trade publication.
   In a related matter, Wall said his agency investigated and found
invalid complaints that Silverado was treated leniently because of
its link to Neil Bush and to Larry Mizel, the owner of MDC Holdings
and a prominent Republican fund-raiser.
   James Moroney, a former analyst at the Federal Home Loan Bank of
Topeka, has alleged Silverado was insolvent in 1986 but that
regulators held off because of its political ties.
   In fact, Wall said, Silverado was targeted for early regulatory
action to minimize its losses and was seized in December 1988.
   He acknowledged regulatory problems at the Topeka bank, but said
Moroney's specific allegation lacked substance.
   ``This individual was not involved with Silverado. He was not
close to Silverado,'' Wall said. ``Maybe he was smelling smoke, but
that individual didn't have anything.''
   Wall, speaking to reporters after a speech to the Association of
Government Accountants, declined to say whether his agency had
looked into a specific transaction between Neil Bush and a major
borrower from Silverado. However, he said, ``We have looked at a
lot of transactions in and around Silverado.'' A bank owned by the
borrower provided Bush's oil and gas company with a $1 million line
of credit.
   A trade publication, National Thrift and Mortgage News, has
reported the FBI is investigating Silverado. Wall confirmed his
agency made ``referrals'' concerning Silverado but declined to
specify if the referrals were to the FBI or Justice Department.

   A lawyer for a Hispanic officer found guilty of
manslaughter in the deaths of two black men said he was a fall guy
used to prevent racial backlash.
   A multi-ethnic jury on Thursday found Officer William Lozano
guilty of manslaughter in the deaths of motorcyclist Clement Lloyd,
23, and passenger Allan Blanchard, 24.
   Attorneys for the Colombian-born officer say they will appeal.
   ``Obviously, the court had its own agenda, and we were here for
justice and not some social engineering or some method of solving
racial problems in Miami,'' said Roy Black, Lozano's attorney. ``We
were here to try to get a fair trial.''
   Circuit Judge Joseph Farina ordered a presentencing
investigation and set a court date for next month.
   The Jan. 16 shooting sparked three days of racial unrest and
police feared that an acquittal in the case would bring more
unrest. The guilty verdict set off a celebration by blacks on the
street where the shooting took place.
   Miami has been racked by racial unrest four times this decade,
including two riots following acquittals of police charged in the
deaths of blacks.
   ``There is no doubt there are many people in this town who are
afraid of any more disturbances,'' Black said. ``And if you add up
the ledgers, it is cheaper to send one police officer to jail than
to pay several million dollars for another riot.''
   Assistant State Attorney John Hogan said the verdict after 7{
hours of jury deliberations was just.
   ``I don't think we take any particular pleasure in convicting a
police officer, but I think there's a great deal of pleasure
realizing the system works no matter what is one's profession or
what his family does,'' said Hogan, the lead prosecutor.
   Prosecutors said Lozano fired unnecessarily at Lloyd, who was
fleeing a police car after a traffic violation. Blanchard died of
injuries suffered in the resulting crash. Lozano claims Lloyd tried
to run him down.
   Black said the appeal would include his unsuccessful argument
for a change of venue. He noted the verdict was sealed for two
hours while preparations for any violence were made.
   ``When we got to the courthouse, you would think World War III
had started,'' Black said. ``There were more armed men with
automatic weapons than I've ever seen in my life and to have a
trial under circumstances like that is absurd.''

   The Department of Transportation says the
government chose a ``reasonable'' route to transport damaged fuel
from the Three Mile Island nuclear plant to Idaho, despite concerns
that the cargo crosses too many urban areas.
   The DOT said in a 47-page report this week that the Energy
Department made ``a reasonable choice when evaluated against the
multiple objective route selection criteria.''
   However, the report also said, ``During the course of planning
the shipping campaign, the Energy Department did not have
well-developed operational guidelines for route selection.''
   Population exposure was not a significant factor in picking the
route, the report said.
   The Energy Department is 3{ years into a program to haul 300,000
pounds of damaged, radioactive fuel by train from the crippled TMI
Unit 2 reactor in Middletown, Pa., to an Idaho laboratory 2,400
miles away.
   Along the way, the fuel passes through Ohio, Indiana, Illinois,
Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado and Wyoming. At the lab, the
material is analyzed by EG&amp;G Idaho, an Energy Department contractor
hoping to learn more about the 1979 TMI incident, the nation's
worst commercial nuclear accident.
   Twenty trips, each taking about five days, have been completed
by the Conrail and Union Pacific railroads. There are expected to
be two more, TMI spokeswoman Mary Wells said Thursday.
   The report noted that the Energy Department ``encountered
opposition to the route, which passes through several large cities
(Pittsburgh, Indianapolis, St. Louis and Kansas City). Most
concerns were from the St. Louis area, and to a lesser extent,
Pittsburgh areas and by the states of Kansas and Illinois.''
   The fuel, along with metal debris, is contained in canisters
secured inside layered stainless steel and lead casks designed to
withstand accidents.
   Because of its confidence in the casks, the Energy Department
did not use population exposure as a major determining factor in
choosing the route, DOT said.
   ``Since the best quality track is usually found on lines
connecting and traversing large population centers, the Energy
Department is generally forced to choose between using higher
quality track and avoiding high population areas,'' the report said.
   The DOT study was prompted by a request from Sen. John Danforth,
D-Mo., for an independent assessment of the route.
   While it found the safety risks acceptable, DOT said the public,
``influenced by the nature of the material, apparently perceives a
risk higher than that based on technical considerations.''
   However, DOT also said that Energy Department poorly documented
its route selection decisions and lacked proper guidelines.
   The Energy Department said in a news release that ``this lack of
documentation does not indicate non-compliance with regulations or
breach of public safety.''
   The shipments are part of the overall $1 billion cleanup of the
TMI reactor.

   Tyrone Smith, 16, also had stopped coming to the park, once
dubbed ``Crack In The Box.''
   ``Too many shootings,'' he said quietly.
   But on Thursday, the teens were showing off their basketball
prowess at Winzer Park and basking in the glow of what President
Bush said was a good example of the nation's ``thousand points of
light.''
   Bush, who sponsored a girls' softball team at the park in 1960,
praised the community's efforts in ridding the playground of drug
dealers, calling it ``a bright star in our nationwide battle''
against drugs.
   But once the cameras and the national press corps left,
neighborhood youngsters returned for a little roundball.
   ``A year to a year and a half ago, the kids wouldn't even come
out to play basketball,'' said Officer Roy Calderon, who patrolled
Winzer Park Thursday. ``They've really done a good job of cleaning
it up and getting rid of the drug dealers. It's better than it used
to be.''
   Erma Scales, president of the Acres Homes War on Drugs
Committee, told Bush the neighbors banded together to end drug
trafficking in the park, calling on police officers and making mass
strolls through the area.
   ``We have told users and dealers, `No more will you use this
park as a drive-through order for the purchase of illegal
narcotics!''' she said. ``Mr. Bush, this is only a small victory in
the war on drugs, but it is very important to us.''
   Calderon said the neighbors supported police.
   ``That helped a lot. Any time the officers get a pat on the
back, that gives you the initiative to try and help them crack
down,'' he said.
   Although an occasional drug deal may still be made in the park
or within several blocks of it, there is no comparison with the
activities that once took place there, Calderon said.
   ``Back then, every other person out here was selling drugs. Even
I'm surprised at the change,'' Calderon said.
   City Electrical Supervisor Donnie Battenfield said crews
frequently had to replace lights on the playing fields and
throughout the park because gangs would smash them.
   Work crews even required a police escort to the park in
daylight, he said. ``I would still always send two people out here
because it was just too dangerous,'' he said.
   But as Battenfield supervised cleanup crews at dusk Thursday, he
said the situation has changed dramatically.
   And the teen-agers noticed the change, too.
   ``I don't see them very much anymore,'' Smith said of the
dealers. ``Now it's people playing basketball and they mostly come
up here at night.''
   ``Most of them have moved to abandoned houses and other bad
areas now,'' said D'Juan Herbert, 16.

<HEAD>Congress Hears Cholesterol Debate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A congressman says the government's
cholesterol education program may be encouraging widespread use of
unnecessary and possibly harmful drugs.
   Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., said differing opinions on the
risks of high cholesterol by experts at a House health subcommittee
hearing Thursday ``raises some troubling questions.''
   Thomas J. Moore, a writer whose article in the September issue
of The Atlantic magazine raised concerns over anti-cholesterol
programs, said he questions the value of the National Cholesterol
Education Program.
   But Claude Lenfant, director of the National Heart, Lung and
Blood Institute, which helped develop the cholesterol program,
defended the guidelines and said they offer ``a clear opportunity
to improve the health of Americans.''
   The program's cholesterol guidelines recommend diet as the
treatment of choice. But if that doesn't work, the guidelines say
patients with high levels of cholesterol should seek treatment with
drugs.
   An estimated 60 million Americans are believed to have high
blood cholesterol, a fatty substance essential for life but which
in high concentrations that can clog arteries and contribute to
heart disease and heart attacks.
   Other characteristics associated with heart disease are high
blood pressure, obesity, smoking and lack of exercise.
   ``The central question is do we have effective medical treatment
that justifies putting 60 million people under long-term care of
their doctor,'' Moore said.
   Moore was joined by medical experts who agreed that all adults
should keep an eye on cholesterol and diets that are low-fat and
low-calorie.
   But they also said that although studies show high cholesterol
levels are a heart-disease risk for middle-age men, the evidence is
lacking for men over 65 and for women of all ages who have no
history of heart disease.
   They also maintain diet has been shown to have only a small
effect on cholesterol and that people generally don't stick to
special diets when they are not part of a closely supervised
medical study.
   Frustration with diets would lead many people to
cholesterol-reducing drugs, which they said have side effects that
include liver damage, cataracts and digestive difficulties.
   ``I am troubled by the prospect of subjecting many people to
lifelong dietary restrictions and potentially hazardous drug
treatment for the sake of health benefits that may never
materialize,'' said Dr. Alan M. Garber of the Stanford University
School of Medicine.
   Lenfant contended the evidence shows that women and the elderly
as well as middle-age men benefit from keeping cholesterol levels
down.
   He also noted that the guidelines recommend dietary changes as a
first step and said this can reduce cholesterol significantly.

<HEAD>Scientists Use `Dinobusting' Method to Help Dig Up Huge Dinosaur</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A method developed to find buried toxic
waste is helping scientists dig up what may be the longest
fossilized dinosaur ever found, a 120-foot seismosaurus who died in
a river 145 million years ago.
   ``Something big in your neighborhood? Who ya gonna call?
Dinobusters!'' is the slogan inscribed on the T-shirt of Oak Ridge
National Laboratory researcher Alan Witten, who developed the
``dinobusting'' technique with about $500,000 from the U.S.
Department of Energy and the Army.
   The $1 million excavation is under way at a secret site
northwest of Albuquerque, N.M., where Witten's technique is used to
locate buried bones by making fuzzy pictures of them with sound
waves.
   ``What Alan is going to do is bring paleontology out of the 19th
century'' by making it faster, easier and cheaper to excavate large
fossils, said J. Wilson Bechtel, who supervises the dig with his
wife, Peggy. They direct the Southwest Paleontology Foundation in
Albuquerque.
   The Tennessee-based Witten discussed the dig and his technique
Thursday during the American Geophysical Union's fall meeting.
   Witten said the Energy Department and the Army's toxic materials
agency paid to develop the method so it could be used to find
buried toxic waste for cleanup, check the integrity of potential
toxic or nuclear waste dumps, and perhaps explore for coal seams.
   The method is similar to medical CT scans, which use X-rays and
detectors to make images of internal organs.
   To make images of buried seismosaurus bones, Witten said he
sends sound waves through the ground using ``an 8-gauge shotgun on
wheels, pointed down. It fires a soft metal slug that hits the
ground and flattens.''
   The sound waves are detected by a set of 29 microphones in a
nearby hole. The sound travels at different rates through rock and
bone. To make an image of one part of the dinosaur, the gun is
moved around and fired repeatedly, producing a two-dimensional
image of a bone's ``sound shadows.''
   The method is similar to that used to make holographs, Witten
said. The sound gun is a commercial kind used to search for oil by
studying the speed of sound waves bouncing off various underground
rocks, not by making an image, he added.
   Several tail vertebrae from the seismosaurus, a relative of
brontosaurus and diplodocus, were discovered by two hikers in 1979.
The exposed bones were excavated in June 1985 by David Gillette,
then paleontology curator at the New Mexico Museum of Natural
History and now Utah's state paleontologist.
   Gillette announced the find in August 1986, coining the name
seismosaurus, or ``earth shaker.''
   The seismosaurus lived in a hot, humid river delta much like
today's Mississippi, and ``probably laid down on a river sandbar
and was covered by sand rather rapidly'' after damming water
upstream, Bechtel said.
   The dinosaur's bones are still in the position where they were
when the animal died.
   Debate continues over whether the seismosaurus or a fossil
dinosaur found near Delta, Colo., is the biggest ever discovered.
Gillette said seismosaurus was at least 120 feet long and probably
longer, and Brigham Young University scientists have said their
dinosaur was at least 100 feet long and possibly 130 feet.
   Until the dinosaurs are excavated, ``it's all speculation,''
said Witten.
   Mrs. Bechtel said it will take at least one more year to
excavate the seismosaurus. So far, the team has removed the base of
the tail, vertebrae, pelvis and several ribs from beneath 8 feet of
sandstone.

   Even after conducting a strip search,
police in this suburban Washington community couldn't decide
whether a bearded person arrested on a robbery charge was a man or
a woman.
   Although the beard indicated masculinity, other physical
evidence suggested otherwise, according to Prince George's County,
Md., police.
   The suspect, L.A. Bowie, 39, was arrested Wednesday and charged
with conspiracy to commit robbery. When questioned about certain
physical discrepancies after undergoing a routine strip search, the
bearded Bowie first told police that there had been an accident,
then that there had been surgery, and finally that there was
another name: Linda Ann Bowie, sources told The Washington Post.
   That revelation prompted another physical examination, after
which doctors concluded that Bowie should be housed as a woman.
   ``The medical director has examined this individual and
determined that this individual should be housed in the medical
unit on the female side,'' said corrections spokeswoman Christy
Merenda. ``That's a medical decision, and that's all I can say.''
   Bowie, who was charged in connection with the Nov. 6 robbery of
a convenience store, remained jailed on $25,000 bond late Thursday.
   Bowie has claimed in numerous interviews to be the father of a
brother and a sister charged with a series of other crimes. Police
sources told The Post that they are trying to determine whether
Bowie is the biological father or mother of the pair.
   Bowie's children, Damon, 19, and Christian, 21, last month were
charged with murder in the execution-style slayings of two
restaurant workers in October.

<HEAD>Thousands Join Rally for Religious Freedom</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of people rallied in the
capital and demanded that the Communist government to recognize
church weddings and reinstate Christmas as a holiday.
   The gathering was Bulgaria's first major rally for religious
freedom in more than four decades.
   Speakers at the Thursday rally called for a change in the 1947
law curtailing religious freedom, complete independence of church
and state and an end to the ``monopoly of the state on spiritual
education.''
   They also called for official recognition of church weddings and
reinstatement of Christmas and Easter as official holidays.
Bulgarians have worked on these holidays since 1944.
   Activists also read aloud the text of three petitions to the
National Assembly demanding religious freedom. About 3,000 signed
the papers.
   The protest was organized by the Society for the Defense of
Religious Freedom and Spiritual Values, an independent group.
   In recent weeks, Bulgarians have begum emulating the
pro-democracy movements sweeping other East bloc countries.
Bulgaria's longtime hard-line Communist Party chief Todor Zhivkov
was ousted on Nov. 10 and replaced by Petar Mladenov, who is
considered more moderate.
   Since then, the government has scrapped a law forbidding
dissent, dismantled a police squad that cracked down on human
rights activists and condemned the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia,
in which it took part.
   Despite those changes, the Bulgarian Orthodox Church hierarchy
has so far remained firmly under control of the ruling Communist
Party.
   One reason for the emigration of hundreds of thousands of ethnic
Turks from Bulgaria earlier this year has been official curbs on
exercising Islamic rites.
   Important changes in religious legislation are expected at a
National Assembly session starting Dec. 14.

   A Connecticut company says it will build
Poland's first cable television system, likely enabling viewers in
Warsaw and Cracow to soon begin watching CNN, ESPN and MTV.
   Chase Enterprises of Hartford, Conn., said Thursday that it will
have a 70 percent stake in Polska Telewizja Kablowa, or PTK, a
cable television system it will build and operate along with
Poltelkab SA, a partnership comprising the Polish Postal Service,
Telephone and Telegraph Co., Polish Radio and Television

   Poltelkab will have the remaining 30 percent interest.
   Company Chairman David Chase, a Pole who fled the Auschwitz Nazi
concentration camp at age 14 during World War II, said it is the
first communications-related joint venture established under
Poland's December 1988 joint venture law.
   ``We view this as only the first of many projects we will
undertake with Poland and in other economically emerging Eastern
European countries,'' Chase said in a statement.

<NOTE>Judge Upholds Rule That Allows Apparel Work at Home</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has ruled in favor of a Labor
Department regulation that allows working at home in five
apparel-related industries.
   U.S. District Court Judge Gerhard Gesell's ruling Thursday
rescinds a ban on home work in the industries making gloves and
mittens, handkerchiefs, buttons and buckles, some types of jewelry
and embroideries.
   Gesell said the Justice Department regulation represents a
``reasoned'' approach requiring firms seeking to institute home
work to come forward and seek certification from the government.
They would be subjected to monitoring by department inspectors.
   The International Ladies Garment Workers' union and two other
unions sued the Secretary of Labor last January, saying tens of
thousands of workers would be exploited by the rule and that the
working standards of other workers would be threatened.
   Gesell said the concerns of labor unions about workers being
exploited by home work ``are no doubt valid.'' A ban on home work
in seven industries was adopted by the Labor Department in the
early 1940s. Home workers in those industries are normally paid by
piece rate rather than hourly wages.
   ``The evidence is strong that the conditions present in the
1940s regarding the exploitation of home workers have not
disappeared,'' said Gesell.
   But the judge said the ``sole issue'' before the court is
whether the Labor Department ``provided a reasoned basis'' for
concluding that a certification system is a better means of
enforcing federal labor law than a total home work ban.

<NOTE>New Rule Aims To Encourage Auto Defects Reporting</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal highway officials say a new rule
requires that automobile manufacturers include a government hotline
number in vehicle owner's manuals to encourage car buyers to report
defects.
   A spokeswoman for a consumers group that has been pushing for
the rule said Thursday that the action is a move away from the
agency's ``tombstone technology,'' which she said results in action
being taken only after deaths and injuries occur.
   The Auto Safety Hotline, in operation since 1975, receives about
a quarter million calls a year either requesting auto safety
information or reporting problems.
   ``This requirement will make it easier for consumers to contact
us to report a safety problem,'' said National Highway Traffic
Safety Administrator Jerry R. Curry.
   The rule proscribes three paragraphs that will have to be
included in manuals for any vehicle manufactured after next Sept.
1, including information about the safety agency's powers to order
defects investigations and recalls. But it will note that NHTSA
``cannot get involved in individual problems between you, your
dealer or manufacturer.''
   The toll-free hotline is 1-800-424-9393.

<NOTE>Lunch Meat Recalled For Possible Food Poisoning</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department says a Sumter,
S.C., processor is voluntarily recalling a single 240-pound
shipment of luncheon meat distributed to nearby stores because some
of the product may be contaminated by food poisoning bacteria.
   Harvin Choice Meats Inc. sold the product _ ``Harvin Sliced
Luncheon Meat,'' packed in 6-ounce vacuum packages _ exclusively to
grocery and convenience stores in a 20-mile radius of Sumter,
officials said Thursday.
   The possible contamination involves Listeria monocytogenes,
bacteria that can cause severe illness, said Lester M. Crawford,
head of the department's Food Safety and Inspection Service.
   Consumers should return the packages where purchased. No other
product of the company is involved in the recall.
   Crawford said no illnesses have been reported as a result of
eating the suspected product. Cartons containing the packages carry
the production code 0318, and each carton and package bears a USDA
inspection seal with ``Est. 6592'' inside the seal.
   Food contaminated with the bacteria can cause listeriosis, a
rare but potentially serious disease, particularly for those with
weakened immune systems _ infants, the elderly and the chronically
ill.
   Consumers with questions about the recall can phone the
toll-free USDA meat and poultry hotline at 1-800-535-4555 from 10
a.m. to 4 p.m. EST, Monday through Friday. Callers in the
Washington, D.C., metropolitan area should call 447-3333.

<HEAD>Justice Minister Pledges To Strengthen Gun Control Following Slaying</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Canada-Slayings, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Canada's justice minister has promised to seek
tougher gun control laws following the shooting rampage that left
14 women dead at the University of Montreal.
   But the official, Doug Lewis, showed no inclination to ban the
type of weapon used by the gunman, and he maintained that no
legislation can guarantee such tragedies will never occur.
   ``You can't legislate against insanity,'' the Conservative Party
legislator said Thursday.
   The mass killing shocked many Canadians who have believed that
carnage on such a scale may have taken place in the United States
but could not happen in their country.
   Automatic weapons are banned in Canada but semi-automatics are
available with the proper permit.
   Some analysts say generally stricter gun control laws in Canada
than in the United States are a factor in a lower crime rate.
   Lewis promised earlier this year to propose amendments to ban
the import of military assault rifles, such as Uzis and AK-47s.
   But the bill would not ban semi-automatic weapons such as the
.223-calibre hunting rifle used in the shootings Wednesday, which
also wounded 13 people.
   ``There are many thousands of gun owners who act responsibly,''
Lewis said. ``Semi-automatics are used for sporting purposes.''
   Gun lobbyists have consistently argued against broadening the
proposed legislation to cover such weapons.
   Svend Robinson, an opposition New Democrat legislator, he
criticized Lewis for delaying his legislation, which has been in
the works since summer but has not come before House of Commons.
   ``How many more tragedies of this nature must we see in this
country, before this Conserative government will finally act to
keep the commitments they made?'' he asked.
   Robinson said that in addition to banning the import of
automatic weapons, the government should consider tightening the
rules for gun permits, limiting the number of cartridges in the
clips of semi-automatics, and requiring people to take safety
courses before being allowed to own a gun.
   Dr. John Hinchey, a surgeon who operated on some of the wounded
students, told a Montreal news conference that he supported a ban
on the type of rifle used in the attack.
   Earlier, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney had termed the slayings
senseless, tragic, and a ``grim reminder of the vulnerability of
our society.''
   Flags on Parliament Hill were at half-staff as about 300 people
gathered just after dark for a candlelight vigil in honor of the
slain students. After speeches by representatives of local women's
groups, they concluded with shouts of: ``No more violence against
women.''

   The slayings of 14 women by a man who said
feminists spoiled his life should be seen as the deed of an
atypical madman, for most men understand feminism's benefits,
scholars said.
   ``I'd hate to say that the vibrant feminist movement in Canada
is the problem _ because the problem was his, not the movement's,''
said Ronnie Steinberg, a feminist-sociologist and professor at
Temple University in Philadelphia.
   Certainly, many men sometimes find feminism vexing, said Shawn
Johnston, a University of California-Davis forensic psychologist
who treats sex offenders, wife beaters and other violent criminals.
   ``There's no question that masculine insecurity has risen and
has been associated with the rise in feminism,'' Johnston said
Thursday. ``And you've certainly got a lot of crazy or damaged,
angry people out there.
   ``The terrible truth is that there is definitely a history of
violence toward women that really permeates our Western culture.''
   And that history came to a head Wednesday with the killings at
the University of Montreal.
   ``One encounters, even among men I would characterize as the
good guys, a sense of frustration sometimes, a transitory sense of
anger,'' Johnston said. ``But when decent men have some twinge of
frustrtion or anger, maybe because they've been passed up for a
promotion, it tends to be fleeting.
   ``My experience has been that most men are quite comfortable
with and also benefit from female liberation. Only a small
percentage of males is going to suffer from the kind of rage and
unsatisfied power needs, or a need to dominate, that we have in
this situation (in Canada).''
   Marie Wilson, executive director of the Ms. Foundation for
Women, countered that newspapers all too frequently carry stories
about violence against women.
   ``It's all about misogyny and anger, but it doesn't get reported
that way until 14 women get killed all at once,'' she said. ``It's
so much a part of our daily lives as women that even we ignore it;
if you faced it, it would make it hard to get up in the morning.''
   Ms. Steinberg echoed those concerns.
   ``Some of us have been concerned for quite a long time that
we're going to be charged with being male-haters because we've
developed a critical perspective on the treatment of women,'' she
said, citing ``a debate within the scholarship on domestic violence
that, as other forms of control become less effective, men
increasingly are resorting to violence.''
   ``Nobody gives up power without a struggle. You see the struggle
over sharing housework, comparable worth and affirmative action _
in all those struggles there is a tremendous backlash,'' she said.
   Molly Yard, president of the National Organization for Women,
observed: ``In any society, when any group tries to move into a
position of equality and is asking to share power, it's never given
willingly.''
   Lives sometimes are lost in such a struggle, she said.
   NOW and the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence are
lobbying to include female victims in a proposed ``Hate Crime
Statistics Act,'' which allows the collection of data about crimes
based on race, religion, sexual orientation or ethnicity.
   Meanwhile, said Ms. Steinberg, ``Within women's circles, we talk
about how to get our ideas across in such a way as to make it less
threatening to people.''
   ``Should feminists have to deal with an increase in masculine
insecurity?'' Johnston said. ``I suppose a trite, but nice, idea
would be for us to care a little more for each other.
   ``If men tried a little harder to struggle with the new roles of
women, it would be good. And perhaps, if feminists who are making
great strides forward took some time to reflect on some of the
anxiety it might cause their male counterparts, that would be good,
too.''

<TEXT>
   An increasing number of women swapping their
bodies for crack and cocaine are passing on syphilis to their
newborn babies, according to a new report from federal health
researchers.
   Last year, 691 cases of congenital syphilis were reported in the
United States, up 54 percent from the year before and the highest
total since the days before penicillin, the Centers for Disease
Control reported Thursday.
   ``The practice of trading sex with multiple partners for drugs,
especially cocaine (or) crack, now appears to play a major role in
the transmission of syphilis,'' the Atlanta-based CDC said.
   Thirty to 40 percent of fetuses infected with syphilis are
stillborn, and those who do survive to birth can die soon after
with syphilis or suffer brain damage, developmental problems or
sight and hearing disorders, said Dr. Paul Zenker of the CDC.
   New York City accounted for 357 of the congenital syphilis cases
in 1988, more than half the national total. Birth certificate
questionnaires and health department interviews showed that 39
percent of the syphilis babies' mothers used cocaine or crack while
they were pregnant, the CDC said.
   New York had reported just 57 congenital syphilis cases in 1986.
   In the first six months of this year, New York health officials
reported 779 newborns with positive syphilis tests. Two-thirds of
those cases will probably prove to be actual syphilis infections,
meaning New York alone could report 1,000 congenital syphilis cases
in 1989, CDC researchers said.
   Syphilis, a common sexually transmitted disease, can be treated
in most cases with penicillin or other antibiotics, although it's
too late to reverse birth defects in many children born with the
disease.
   Syphilis babies may be in double jeopardy because their addicted
mothers ``may not access the health-care system fully,'' depriving
the babies of the prenatal care they need, the CDC said.
   Only half the mothers in the New York study reported any
prenatal care visits.

   Nearly 2,000 East Germans have been moving to
West Germany each day in an exodus that has continued despite their
new freedom to travel abroad and promises of reform by Communist
leaders in their homeland.
   In the first six days of December, 11,625 East Germans
registered to resettle in their rich western neighbor, bringing the
total number of East German immigrants to about 312,000, the West
German Interior Ministry said Thursday.
   Under West Germany's constitution, East Germans are granted
automatic citizenship.
   The December exodus is small compared with the 10,000 or more
East Germans who left daily via Czechoslovakia shortly before East
Germany _ hoping to stem the flow _ opened the Berlin Wall and its
other borders to West Germany on Nov. 9.
   The stream fell to about 1,500 a day by late November but picked
up again during the last two weeks as uncertainty about the
country's future increased.
   Ina Ruehl, a Red Cross spokeswoman in Bonn, said no end to the
exodus is in sight.
   ``We all thought the trend would be downward, but that didn't
happen,'' she said in a telephone interview. ``The future is
uncertain. Of course a lot depends on political developments in
East Germany.''
   Former Communist Party Chief Egon Krenz ordered travel
restrictions lifted so citizens wouldn't have to flee, but Krenz
has been ousted in the second leadership reshuffle in six weeks.
   The government now has promised to grant free elections and
broad political freedoms.
   Only a small fraction of the millions of who have visited West
Berlin and West Germany after the opening of frontiers decided to
stay. But East Germany's struggling economy can not afford the
steady drain of mostly young, educated workers.
   Shortages of medical personnel already have been reported in
East Germany, and an East Berlin newspaper warned last week that
the country faced a ``collapse of society'' if the exodus does not
stop.
   Berliner Zeitung said citizens were leaving because authorities
were not moving quickly enough against corruption.
   About 700 East Germans are crossing every day to West Berlin, a
non-Communist island in the middle of East Germany. Emergency
shelters are stretched to the limit and resentment is building.
   West Berlin said Nov. 28 it would accept only East Germans who
can prove they are joining parents or children. Other resettlers
are being sent to West Germany.
   The announcement has not reduced the numbers of people coming to
West Berlin, said Rita Hermanns, spokeswoman for the city's social
and health services authority.
   ``We cannot keep all school gymnasiums of this city occupied
indefinitely,'' she said. ``We would certainly like to use them for
sports again.''

   A physician who solicited college
students to have sex with his wife in a purported research project
was found dead in his home in what police said was an apparent
suicide.
   Police were called to the home of Dr. Rodney Thorp Wood, 60,
about 1 p.m. Thursday, Southampton Village police Sgt. Lars King
said.
   Wood, dressed in casual clothes, was found in his second-floor
bedroom with a gunshot wound to the head. A 12-gauge double-barrel
shotgun was found near the body, said Southampton Village Detective
Sgt. David Betts.
   Betts said the death appeared to be suicide, although no note
was found.
   Wood and his wife, Nancy Steffen Wood, 44, were arrested in
September in Eugene, Ore., after allegedly offering to pay male
students at the University of Oregon to have sex with her.
   Both pleaded guilty Oct. 23 to prostitution, a misdemeanor, and
each was fined $2,500.
   The socially prominent Woods were listed in the Blue Book of The
Hamptons on Long Island, lived in a mansion and owned a yacht.
   Their lives changed when they were arrested Sept. 16 at a Eugene
hotel.
   Four students testified before a grand jury that they were asked
to have sex with Mrs. Wood. Police said at least one student had
sex with Mrs. Wood and that Wood photographed and tape-recorded the
encounter, for which the student was paid $30.
   Betts said it appeared no one else had been in the house at the
time of the shooting.
   A family spokesman, Ethan Geto, said he had been in contact with
Wood earlier this week. He said Wood ``was very distressed
throughout this whole episode, but I didn't detect that he was any
more distraught than he had been in the past.''
   ``When your name and reputation are dragged through the media
and your character and conduct are called into question and your
life's work is threatened, then clearly this is distressing,'' Geto
said.

<TEXT>
   The captain of the USS Iowa, which lost 47
of its sailors in an April gun turret explosion, said his young
crew rebounded remarkably well from the tragedy.
   The battleship returned Thursday to the Norfolk Naval Station
after a six-month deployment that took its 1,500-man crew to the
Baltic, North Sea and Mediterranean. The crew had seven weeks to
prepare for the trip after the explosion that occurred during a
gunnery exercise off the coast of Puerto Rico.
   ``No other crew, in any navy, could overcome a tragedy like the
one April 19 and do what this crew has done,'' Capt. Fred P.
Moosally said.
   While the Iowa was at sea, the Navy released its report on the
explosion.
   It found the blast most likely was caused by a disgruntled
gunner's mate who sabotaged the huge gun and died in the explosion.
   That report is being challenged by many of the families of the
47 victims who believe the Navy is covering up equipment and
training failures aboard the World War II-era battleship.
   Congressional committees will hear testimony next week from Navy
officials and FBI experts.
   Navy investigators found that sabotage was the only explanation
for the explosion, but the FBI has declined to endorse that
conclusion because its tests and investigation failed to duplicate
the Navy's findings.
   Moosally is to testify Monday before the Senate Armed Services
Committee.
   He said the Iowa's record during the deployment and its ability
to respond in emergencies showed the worth of the battleship to the
country's defense.
   The Iowa's homecoming was vastly more cheerful than its return
to Norfolk in April four days after the explosion. This time there
were bands, welcome home signs, gaily colored balloons and cheerful
faces in the crowd of more than 1,000 who huddled in the cold,
blustery wind.

<HEAD>New Survey Finds Hispanics Heavier Than Other Americans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new survey finds that Hispanic Americans, on
the average, tend to be heftier than other Americans.
   The national Centers for Disease Control said Thursday a study
of Mexican Americans in the West, Cuban Americans in Miami and
Puerto Ricans in metropolitan New York found overweight problems
for Hispanics were ``substantially higher than those reported for
non-Hispanic Americans.''
   Among Mexican Americans, 30 percent of men and 39 percent of
women were overweight. Among Cuban Americans, 29 percent of men and
34 percent of women were overweight. And among the New York Puerto
Ricans, 25 percent of men and 37 percent of women were overweight.
   In another survey, the CDC said overweight men among
non-Hispanics accounted for 24 percent of whites and 25 percent of
blacks. Among women, it was 25 percent of whites and 44 percent of
blacks.
   The CDC said the three surveyed Hispanic groups account for
about three-fourths of the Hispanic population in the United
States. The survey was not a nationwide one, but it is a
scientifically based sample in those three areas, said Michael
Rowland, a researcher with the National Center for Health
Statistics, a branch of the CDC.
   Reasons for the trend are ``pure conjecture,'' said Dr. David F.
Williamson, a CDC researcher. He noted that Hispanic Americans, in
general, have lower income and education status than do white
Americans, ``and people at the lower end of socioeconomics are at
greater risk of being overweight _ this is an especially strong
pattern among women.''
   The term overweight, in the NCHS survey, was used for anyone
whose ``body mass index'' _ a measurement of height and weight _
was in the top 15 percent of men or women in their 20s.
   ``Severely overweight'' indicated the top 5 percent. That
designation applied to between 8 percent to 10 percent of
Hispanic-American men and 8 percent to 16 percent of
Hispanic-American women, compared with generally lower levels for
non-Hispanics.
   The Hispanic survey was conducted as part of the NCHS Hispanic
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 1982-84.

<HEAD>Study Suggests Link Between Barrier Contraceptives and Pregnancy
Ailment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SARAH NORDGREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new study linking barrier contraceptives with a
condition that is the third leading cause of death in pregnancy is
interesting but preliminary, according to the study's author and
others.
   The study, which appears in today's Journal of the American
Medical Association, found that women who used barrier
contraceptives such as diaphragms or condoms were more than twice
as likely as other women to develop the condition, called
preeclampsia.
   Preeclampsia occurs in about 7 percent of pregnancies and is
characterized by high blood pressure, fluid retention and protein
in the urine.
   It frequently occurs late in pregnancy and is more common in
first pregnancies. Untreated, it can lead to maternal seizures and,
in rare cases, cause death to either the fetus or the mother.
   But the lead researcher cautioned Thursday that the results were
preliminary and that ``many more studies are needed'' before final
conclusions into the cause of the condition are made.
   And a doctor who treats high-risk pregnancies said health
benefits of barrier contraceptives _ especially condoms _ probably
outweigh the risks.
   ``I'm very concerned with the conclusion that barrier
contraceptives may be bad for you,'' said Dr. Alan Peaceman, who
teaches in the division of maternal-fetal medicine at Northwestern
University Medical School in Chicago.
   ``My concern is that barrier contraception is a very important
kind of contraception in this country, not just for preventing
pregnancy, but for prevention of spreading disease,'' he said.
``The health benefit from this form of birth control may still
outweigh the risks, even if they exist.''
   The causes of preeclampsia, also called toxemia, remain
mysterious. Previous studies have indicated it may be linked to
such things as a genetic predisposition, environmental factors or
the immune system.
   The study, by researchers at the University of North Carolina's
School of Public Health, was the first to focus on the relationship
between all kinds of birth control and preeclampsia.
   It found that women who used barrier contraceptives before
deciding to become pregnant were 2.37 times as likely to develop
the condition as those who used other types of birth control.
   For research purposes, barrier contraceptives included
diaphragms, condoms, spermicides and withdrawal. Non-barrier
methods included IUDs, birth control pills, and no birth control.
   The study examined 225 women, ages 15 to 35, who delivered their
first child at a North Carolina hospital between 1984 and 1987.
   Of the subjects chosen, 110 were picked because they developed
preeclampsia, and the other 115 had not. The women were interviewed
by telephone and their responses compared with their medical
records.
   For women to be classified as users of barrier contraceptives,
they must have used barrier methods exclusively for the entire time
of their sexual relationship with the child's father.
   The authors hypothesized that prior exposure to sperm may have
some sort of immunologic effect that aids in preventing the
development of the condition.
   ``Women who were exposed to smaller amounts of sperm or fewer
episodes of sperm exposure were at greater risk of preeclampsia,''
lead researcher Hillary Klonoff-Cohen said Thursday.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Mario Cuomo is set to run for a third
term, saying there's nothing else he wants to do at this point in
his life.
   While side-stepping a formal announcement, Cuomo on Thursday
indicated that he had no plans to skip a re-election bid for New
York governor next year to prepare for a 1992 race for the
presidency.
   ``If I had to decide right this moment, I know exactly what I
would do,'' said Cuomo in a telephone interview that provided the
strongest signal to date about his plans. ``The logic is very
simple ...
   ``There's just nothing else I want to do. There's just nothing I
can do that's as important as this ... I don't have any
alternatives.''
   One of the few things that could convince him to change his mind
was failing health, Cuomo said, adding: ``I've never been in better
physical condition.''
   At an earlier news conference in his state Capitol office, Cuomo
had said he was in no hurry to announce his decision on running for
re-election. ``I'm going to use all the time I can. It doesn't make
sense not to,'' he said.
   Cuomo aides have said they expect him to run for re-election and
then, should he win, to consider running for president. He has said
he's yet to give any thought to a 1992 presidential bid.
   State Republican Party Chairman J. Patrick Barrett welcomed
Cuomo's comments. ``I really hope he does (run for re-election),''
said Barrett. ``I would really like us to have a good go at him.''

   The Soviet factory ship Witauta Sputna was reported still
burning five hours after the emergency was reported by the crew of

   The Coast Guard initially reported that the Flamares had taken
survivors aboard, but later it said that 55 Soviet seamen had been
rescued by the Danish freighter Elena and 25 aboard the Laurits
Tholstrup, registered in Singapore.
   The captain of the Witauta Sputna was among those rescued, and
he indicated that two of his men had died, the Coast Guard said.

<TEXT>
   Frances Bavier, best known as Aunt Bee
from ``The Andy Griffith Show,'' showed increasing fondness for her
television character in her final years, her attorney said.
   Early in her retirement, Miss Bavier sought to escape
identification with her television past, but in her later years,
she increasingly referred to herself as Aunt Bee and continued to
wear her hair in a bun, said J. Samuel Williams, her attorney and a
close friend for many years.
   Miss Bavier, who had a history of heart problems, died quietly
in her sleep at her stately Siler City home about 7 p.m. Wednesday,
just two days after her release from the local hospital where she
had been treated for almost two weeks in the coronary care unit,
authorities said.
   She would have turned 87 this month.
   Neither the attorney nor the hospital would release the cause of
death in keeping with her wishes.
   She became famous for her role in the popular show starring Andy
Griffith as a North Carolina sheriff. She portrayed the devoted
aunt, who was known for her Southern cooking and who helped raise
the widower Andy Taylor's son, Opie, portrayed by Ron Howard.
   ``She missed having family. She said she had no family because
she dedicated her life to the stage and the screen. And she
regretted that,'' Williams said.
   Dick Linke, manager for Griffith, who played Sheriff Andy Taylor
in the series, said Griffith wanted people to know that Miss Bavier
``was a fine woman, a wonderful actress and most of all, a
brilliant character actress.''
   Griffith did not plan to attend Miss Bavier's funeral, Linke
said.
   A native of New York City, Miss Bavier attended Columbia
University, was a graduate of the American Academy of the Arts and
had more than 20 years of stage experience.
   She did stints in vaudeville and on Broadway, where she appeared
in such productions as ``Kiss and Tell,'' ``Point of No Return''
and ``The Lady Says No.''
   But she became famous for her role of Aunt Bee, which she
continued in the series ``Mayberry RFD.'' She won an Emmy for the
role in 1967.
   When she settled in Siler City in 1972, her presence was more
felt than seen, said Al Resch, editor of the local newspaper The
Chatham News.
   He described her as a recluse brought on by her illness and her
love of privacy.
   The rare occasions Miss Bavier ventured out, it was usually in
the evening to buy groceries, Resch said.
   Williams would not comment on her will or the size of her estate
except to say she did not die penniless and that she made
arrangements for her 15 cats to be taken care of after her death.
   A private graveside memorial service will held at 2 p.m. Sunday
at Oakwood Cemetery in Siler City, Williams said.

   The government will turn over to
Scottish police evidence seized from a Palestinian suspected of
complicity in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103.
   The Cabinet's decision Thursday to release the evidence was a
formal step needed by investigators to conduct a forensic
examination of clothing taken during a raid on the home of Mohammed
Abu Talb.
   The District Court in the city of Uppsala ruled Monday that Abu
Talb was a suspect in the December 1988 explosion of Flight 103
over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people. The court also
said seizure of evidence from his home was legal.
   Under Swedish law, the Cabinet's approval is necessary to take
evidence out of Sweden.
   Police removed 15 bags of clothing from his home, searching for
clothing acquired during a trip he made to Malta in late 1988. The
forensic examination would determine if those clothes matched
clothes from Malta in the suitcase that contained the bomb.
   Abu Talb, a former member of the Palestine Popular Struggle
Front who has lived in Sweden since 1983, is in jail awaiting a
Dec. 21 verdict on separate charges of murder and attempted murder
in connection with four bombings in Stockholm, Copenhagen and
Amsterdam in 1985 and 1986. One person was killed and more than 20
wounded in those bombings.
   An official of the Uppsala District Court said today that
British authorities have not asked for Abu Talb's extradition. Such
a request was reported likely to prevent Abu Talb's release if he
is acquitted of the bombing charges. He faces a maximum life
sentence.

<HEAD>Special Counsel Denies Conflict in Lincoln Ethics Probe</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Senate Ethics Committee's special counsel
investigating the five senators involved in the Lincoln Savings &amp;
Loan controversy has ties to developers with large loans from an
investment conglomerate linked to the thrift, The Washington Times
reported today.
   Robert S. Bennett denied in two telephone interviews conducted
by The Times on Wednesday that his firm's legal representation of a
Washington, D.C., developer in obtaining $65 million in 30-year
loans from a subsidiary of Dallas-based Southmark Corp. represented
a conflict of interest.
   Bennett last month excused himself as special counsel in another
Senate ethics case involving Sen. Alphonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., and the
scandal at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Bennett
said his law firm had clients in a federal housing matter and that
he wanted to avoid even the appearance of a conflict.
   Bennett denied any possible conflict in the investigation of the
five senators who intervened on behalf of Charles H. Keating Jr.
with federal banking regulators in April 1987 when his Lincoln
Savings and Loan of Irvine, Calif., was collapsing, The Times said.
   Government records show that when Lincoln went bankrupt earlier
this year, it held about $350 million in junk bonds issued by
Southmark and other entities. Southmark also had about $120 million
in loans for ``working capital'' and other investment purposes from
Lincoln, the records show.
   Bennett's firm represented Square 37 Partners, a real estate
venture headed by developer Joseph W. Kaempfer Jr., in the group's
successful effort to get $65 million in Southmark financing in 1984
to buy a luxury hotel and an office building in the nation's
capital, according to U.S. District Court records. The newspaper
also said District of Columbia records show that Bennett and
members of his law firm remain partners with Kaempfer in another

<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino urged the
nation today to unite against those ``who want to destroy our
democracy'' as 100,000 Filipinos rallied to support her government
against a violent coup attempt.
   Mrs. Aquino bitterly criticized Vice President Salvador Laurel,
Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile and others who have called for her
resignation after mutinous soldiers launched the sixth and
strongest attempt yet to oust her.
   ``He (Laurel) cannot wait to be president,'' she told a rally at
the site where hundreds of thousands of Filipinos filled the
streets to support her 1986 ``people power'' revolution. ``I will
never give up this position to him.''
   She made no reference to any of the complaints of the rebels or
of other critics who claim her government has failed to live up to
the promises of social justice and reform.
   In the southern city of Cebu, a leader of rebel soldiers holding
a military base today ruled out surrendering to loyalist troops,
keeping the insurrection alive.
   Mrs. Aquino had called on Filipinos to turn out into the streets
today for a rally and Roman Catholic Mass, hoping to rekindle the
spirit of the huge demonstrations that propelled her into office in
February 1986 and ousted President Ferdinand Marcos.
   Estimates of the crowd size at today's rally varied widely.
Government television said 1 million people joined the rally, but
reporters estimated the crowd at more than 100,000.
   Government offices encouraged their employees to turn out in a
show of support for the embattled president. Some government
workers were bused in from as far as Angeles, 50 miles to the north.
   ``I want all of us to unite and to give support to the
democratic systems of government and to go after these people who
want to destroy our democracy, who want to destroy our economy, who
want to destroy the Filipino people,'' she said in English.
   In Tagalog, the main Philippine language, Mrs. Aquino bitterly
criticized Laurel and Enrile, leaders of the opposition Nacionista
Party. The crowd cheered wildly and chanted ``Cory! Cory! Cory!''
at mention of the two opposition leaders' names.
   ``He keeps on urging me to resign,'' Mrs. Aquino said of Laurel.
``What does he think I am? Stupid?''
   ``...If Laurel really loves our country like he always says,
then I suggest he resign so we can use the money from his office,''
Mrs. Aquino said.
   In his homily, Cardinal Jaime L. Sin, Roman Catholic archbishop
of Manila, condemned ``self-appointed messiahs'' for launching the
coup attempt.
   He called for the mutinous soldiers to face punishment ``with
the full force of the law.
   ``We have condemned the naked and brazen bid for power through
violence and bloodshed,'' Sin said.
   At least 79 people have been killed and more than 570 others
since Dec. 1, when rebel soldiers took over several military
garrisons and bombed the presidential palace.
   Loyal forces, backed by air cover from U.S. F-4 fighter jets,
counterattacked and regained most bases. Early Thursday, mutineers
marched back to their bases from the financial district of Makati,
claiming they were voluntarily returning to their barracks.
   But negotiations broke down with the final rebel group of 400,
which has held Mactan air base at Cebu City, 350 miles south of
Manila, since the coup attempt began.
   ``To negotiate for surrender is still out of the question,''
Brig. Gen. Jose Commendador, leader of the Mactan rebels, told
reporters early today. ``Surrender seems to be the only option that
they want.''
   Laurel predicted Thursday there would be more violent attempts
to topple Mrs. Aquino until she addresses fundamental problems of
poverty and social injustice that plague Philippine society.
   The military claimed about 300 rebels gave up in the Makati
financial district in Manila, but reporters said the number
appeared to be closer to 500. Officials estimate more than 3,000
troops joined the mutiny at its highpoint.
   The rebels withdrew from Makati one day after about 1,800
foreigners, among them roughly 250 Americans, were evacuated from
rebel-held luxury hotels there.
   On Dec. 2, Mrs. Aquino ruled out negotiations with the rebels
and warned them ``surrender or die.'' But in the end she stepped
aside to allow loyal military commanders to resolve the crisis
peacefully.
   Most rebel officers in past coup attempts have simply been
confined to barracks. The government has not said what punishment,
if any, would be leveled against the mutinous soldiers.

<HEAD>Marcos Refused To Answer Questions Regarding Alleged Slush Fund</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RORY MARSHALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In videotaped testimony, former Philippine
President Ferdinand Marcos refused in 1986 and 1987 to answer
questions on the alleged use of a slush fund to pay for the murders
of two anti-Marcos activists.
   The late ruler invoked the Fifth Amendment privilege against
self-discrimination in a video deposition shown Thursday in a
wrongful-death lawsuit filed by the families of Silme Domingo and
Gene Viernes. The two were shot June 1981 in the Seattle offices of
the Alaska Cannery Workers Union.
   The U.S. District Court lawsuit claims the murder plot
originated in Manila because the victims, who were officers of the
union, were involved in anti-Marcos activism.
   Three men were convicted of the murders on the theory that the
victims had crossed the killers by working to eliminate gang
influence on work assignments and gambling in Alaska fish canneries.
   But the suit claims an intelligence slush fund, administered by
the Mabuhay Corp., paid $15,000 for the murders. The company was
run by Dr. Leonilo Malabed of San Francisco.
   Marcos, who died last September, had acknowledged Malabed was a
friend, but invoked his privilege against self-incrimination when
asked for specifics of intelligence funding and the Mabuhay company.
   Among the key documents in the trial is one that plaintiffs
claim is a Mabuhay account sheet for the slush fund. Under a
heading for ``security projects'' is a May 17 entry for $15,000.
   The plaintiffs claim former cannery-union president Constantine
Baruso, whose gun was used in the killings, was in San Francisco on
that date to pick up the money. Baruso, who was never criminally
charged in the murders, also invoked the Fifth Amendment 75 times
during his testimony earlier in the lawsuit trial.
   Marcos gave depositions during two sessions after he fled to
Hawaii following the February 1986 overthrow of his government.
   Marcos, his widow, Imelda, the Philippines government and others
are defendants in the suit, which seeks $30 million in damages.
   Marcos also would not answer whether the Philippines National
Bank was used to channel money to the United States for
intelligence operations in the late 1970s and 1980s, and whether
funds were provided ``to conduct acts of physical violence against
the anti-Marcos opposition ... including and up to the use of
murder, political assassination and summary execution.''
   Viernes had visited the Philippines shortly before his death and
met with anti-Marcos trade unionists. Marcos was not asked
specifically whether he knew of Viernes but said he was concerned
about leftist influence on Philippine trade unions.
   ``We were aware of the efforts of the leftists or the communists
to influence labor and use some of the unions as their fronts,'' he
said.
   But he denied labor organizers were arrested or ``disappeared''
for their activities.
   ``There were no political detainees in my opinion,'' he said.
``We never jailed anybody just because of their political
opinions.''

<HEAD>63 Journalists Killed in 1989</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A report on press freedom around the world has
found that over 1,000 journalists were attacked or harassed this
year, more than double the number attacked in 1988.
   ``When terrorism targets the press, it does more than kill
journalists. It casts a pall of self-censorship and despair over
the whole society,'' wrote Leonard R. Sussman in the Freedom House
report issued Thursday.
   Worldwide, governments in 1989 shut down 38 publications or
radio stations and arrested 324 reporters. The number of
journalists attacked or harassed was 1,045 _ up from 465 in 1988.
   Sixty-three journalists were murdered this year, including 19 in
Colombia, where cocaine traffickers have killed reporters and
publishers and bombed newspapers in an effort to keep the press
from reporting on the drug war, the report stated.
   South Africa detained more than 100 journalists in 1989 and
tried to keep the media from reporting anti-apartheid protests, the
report said.
   The report found that press freedom expanded in Algeria,
Botswana, Chile, Gambia, Paraguay and Tunisia, as well as in parts
of Eastern Europe, where local political developments were reported
as never before. Hungary and Poland's media dramatically
diversified, with previously banned writers openly featured.
   In the Soviet Union, there were signs of glasnost in the press
as the media reported on controversial subjects like the war in
Afghanistan and the deploying of a large radar station in violation
of a treaty with the United States.
   But two Soviet journalists _ including an investigative reporter
for Ogonyok, a reformist magazine _ were killed, the report stated.
Last week, Sergei Kuznetsov, an independent Siberian reporter, was
sentenced to three years in a labor camp for ``slandering'' an
official. And 25 prominent Estonian journalists were suddenly
called to army duty after writing critically of the military and
other governmental activities, the report said.
   In China, at least 56 Chinese journalists were arrested and 23
foreign journalists were maltreated, including several who were
beaten in detention and one who was shot. Many foreign journalists
were expelled in the wake of the Tiananmen Square massacre, and
Chinese journalists were required to attend ``ideological
meetings,'' Freedom House said.
   Other countries that experienced more restrictions on the press
included Panama, the Sudan, Nigeria and Suriname.

   No more ``no mas.''
   In a battle of two old adversaries, Sugar Ray Leonard bored the
crowd but won the judges Thursday night to score a lopsided
decision over Roberto Duran and retain his super middleweight
boxing title.
   Nine years after he forced Roberto Duran to quit in the eighth
round in what is known as the ``No Mas'' fight in New Orleans, the
33-year-old Leonard was at it again, mugging and dancing and
jabbing circles around a fighter who suddenly looked very much his
38 years of age.
   ``It was deja vu,'' Leonard said. ``It had been nine years since
we've been together and it was deja vu.''
   Leonard was so dominant that one judge didn't give Duran a
round. Another gave him only the 12th round.
   Leonard picked up at least $15 million and Duran $7.6 million
for the fight, which was televised on pay-per-view and to closed
circuit locations across the country.

<HEAD>Death Sentence Given To Two For June 4 Murder Of Policeman</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Beijing court today sentenced two men to death
and another to life in prison for the murder of a policeman during
the June military crackdown on Beijing.
   The official Beijing Evening News said the court's verdict
reflected the government's bid to ``severely attack the
counterrevolutionary element's criminal activities and safeguard
the state's safety.''
   The government, meanwhile, expressed its ``utmost indignation''
over U.S. measures to allow Chinese students fearing persecution at
home to extend their stays in the United States.
   Sentenced to die were Meng Duo, an unemployed worker, and Zhou
Jiguo, a restaurant employee. Chen Yong, a worker from the
northeast city of Tangshan, received a life sentence.
   They were charged with the murder of Li Guorui, a 20-year-old
member of the People's Armed Police, in an attack at 5 a.m. On June
4, at about the same time the military was moving into Tiananmen
Square after a bloody all-night thrust through the streets of the
capital.
   The court said Meng attacked Li with the handle of a shovel
while Zhou kicked and beat the young policeman and clubbed him with
a stick. Chen whipped the stricken Li with a belt.
   Li was then thrown off the Fuchengmen bridge located southeast
of the square, according to earlier reports.
   Li was one of several soldiers and policemen killed during the
June 3-4 fighting who was hailed by Chinese leaders and the
official press as a national martyr who laid down his life to put
down what the government called a ``counterrevolutionary rebellion''
   Dozens of wreaths of white, yellow, pink and blue paper
chrysanthemums were hung from the bridge and a photo of Li was
draped in black ribbons. Offerings of fruit and drinks were laid
before it.
   The government claims that 300 people were killed when the
military stormed Beijing to end the student-led pro-democracy
demonstrations, and most of them were soldiers.
   Unofficial Chinese and foreign estimates of the number of deaths
range up into the thousands, with almost all the casualties being
unarmed citizens killed by soldiers firing into crowds.
   At least seven other participants in the Beijing demonstrations,
all workers, were previously put to death for rioting. At least 11
others in Shanghai and Chengdu have also been executed for rioting
during the political turmoil of June.
   Those receiving the death sentence have the right to appeal, but
appeals are almost always rejected and executions, by a bullet to
the back of the head, normally take place within a few days of
sentencing.
   The protest against the U.S. decision to allow students to
remain in the United States was delivered by Vice Foreign Minister
Liu Huaqiu to U.S. Embassy Charge D'Affaires Lynn Pascoe.
   It was the third official protest China has made to the United
States in the past three weeks.
   Liu said allegations that Chinese studying abroad might be
persecuted upon their return home was ``utterly groundless.''
   He said he hoped the United States would cease all actions that
``undermine bilateral educational exchanges and bilateral
relations.''
   President Bush on Nov. 30 announced a veto of a congressional
bill that would permit Chinese students to change their visa status
and remain in the United States if they feared persecution at home.
   Bush, however, said he was taking administrative steps that
would guarantee Chinese students the same rights of abode as
prescribed by Congress.

   Sniper fire killed four children as rival
Shiite Moslem militias battled for dominance in densely populated
residential districts in west Beirut, police said today.
   The four children were among 10 people killed and 20 wounded in
the clashes that began Thursday and raged through the night, a
police spokesman said.
   One of the dead children, 7-year-old Hassan Hamdan, was shot in
the head by a sniper as he switched on his bedroom light in the
district of Mossaitbeh, a stronghold for the mainstream Shiite Amal
militia.
   All of the children were shot in their homes, said the
spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Snipers hugging the rooftops opened fire on major intersections
on both sides of a 1-mile confrontation line that separated
Syrian-backed Amal fighters from combatants of the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   The thuds of exploding rocket-propelled grenades accompanied by
the crackle of machine gun fire echoed across Beirut early in today
as the two warring factions battled for control of five slum
districts in west Beirut.
   Stray bullets shattered glass and scarred the walls and
balconies of residential buildings as civilians huddled in
basements and bomb shelters.
   Amal and Hezbollah fighters battled in the rain all night
despite three cease-fire accords called by a security committee
comprising representatives of the principal militias in Lebanon.
   Schools closed throughout west Beirut, reflecting fear that the
clash might spread to other districts, especially the
Shiite-populated slums on the city's southern edge.
   The command of a Syrian army contingent in charge of security in
west Beirut sent patrols of helmeted troops around the
confrontation region to prevent the clashes from spreading.
   ``They are firing at random. They direct their rifles at the
other side, empty a clip and take cover again,'' said Ahmed Itani,
a resident of Mossaitbeh. ``God knows what the bullets hit ...''
   The clash broke out around noon Thursday in the Khandaq
al-Ghamiq district. Both Amal and Hezbollah blamed each other for
provoking the confrontation.
   Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem, issued a statement
urging both groups to ``put an immediate end to this destructive
fighting and to have mercy on the innocent civilians.''
   A police spokesman said tension was high in other Shiite
populated districts in Beirut and the city's southern slums.
   ``Both sides are massing fighters in their respective areas of
influence,'' said the spokesman, who cannot be named in line with
regulations.
   The Shiite confrontation broke out two days after Hezbollah
smashed Amal in the western sector of the Syrian-policed Bekaa
valley, destroying its five major centers in the area.
   By police count, 17 people were killed in that confrontation, 16
Amal fighters and one Hezbollahi. Forty-two others were wounded.
   The two groups have been fighting intermitently since May 1987
for dominance of the 1.2 million Shiites, the largest community in
among Lebanon's four million people.
   By police count, 552 people have been killed and 1,532 wounded
in the previous Amal-Hezbollah battles.
   The violence is in addition to the 14-year-old civil war between
Moslem militias and Christian forces.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soup kitchens and food pantries in New York City
have multiplied 20 times in eight years, and their clients say
sky-high rents and a shortage of unskilled jobs are reasons why, a
published report said.
   ``A lot of people have jobs, but the rent man takes it all,''
said Raymond Frazier, 39, over a plate of pork and beans at the
Community Food Resource Center on West 116th Street.
   According to a Food and Hunger Hotline survey on emergency food
programs in the city, the number of soup kitchens and food pantries
has jumped from about 30 in 1981 to about 600, New York Newsday
said in today's editions.
   Hotline Director Christina Walker said the government is not
addressing hunger adequately, and that the existence of privately
run food programs may be helping the government get away with it.
   ``We're like enablers, allowing the government to continue its
horrible, destructive behavior,'' said Walker.
   People in line for handouts attribute the problem to high rents,
a shortage of unskilled jobs and red tape in getting food stamps
and other government assistance, Newsday said.
   The hotline, a non-profit group that tells callers where they
can find food, said the majority of people seeking food are not
homeless but rather the elderly, the disabled, the unemployed, the
working poor, women on welfare and their children.

<TEXT>
   On the street where a Miami policeman shot a black
motorcyclist, people danced and drivers honked their horns after a
jury convicted the officer on manslaughter charges.
   Police officers with riot gear were on alert in Miami's Overtown
section for fear that Thursday's outcome in the trial of Officer
William Lozano would spark another round of racial unrest. Instead,
the televised verdict turned a planned protest into a spontaneous
celebration.
   Lozano showed no emotion when he heard the guilty verdict on two
manslaughter counts in the Jan. 16 deaths of two black men _
motorcyclist Clement Lloyd, 23, and passenger Allan Blanchard, 24.
   He faces a maximum sentence of 45 years. Sentencing was set for
mid-January, and his attorneys plan an appeal.
   Lozano, who has been suspended with pay, may soon lose his job.
Police chief Perry Anderson prepared paperwork for Lozano's
dismissal after the verdict was announced and sent it to department
lawyers for review, the Miami Herald reported today.
   ``More than likely they're going to move for his termination,''
police spokesman George Law said today. But he said before Lozano
could be dismissed, an investigation must be ordered.
   In the inner-city Overtown neighborhood, amid the dancing of
about 100 blacks, Evert Wright said, ``A black man finally got
justice. It took a long, long time, but we finally got justice.''
   ``For 10 years ... we've been waiting for at least a token of
commitment from the justice system,'' said Billy Hardemon, leader
of People United for Justice.
   He stood in front of two symbolic silver coffins and stacks of
signs accusing police and city leaders of racism. Blacks had
planned a march on the courthouse if Lozano was acquitted.
   ``This conviction sends a clear message to policemen that the
policeman is not above the law,'' Hardemon said.
   But many Hispanics said the Colombian-born Lozano, 31, was a
scapegoat used to ward off a riot. Hundreds of callers jammed phone
lines at Spanish-language radio stations to express anger.
   ``They said the justice system in the United States works one
way for the blacks and another for the Hispanic community,'' said
Fernando Escobar, afternoon news coordinator for WOCN-AM.
   Directors of two major Spanish-language radio stations announced
a campaign to organize listeners to petition the judge for leniency
in sentencing Lozano.
   Lozano, who remains free on $10,000 bail, said he received an
unfair trial.
   ``We will continue fighting with the help of the Colombian
community here in Miami,'' he said, appealing for more money for
his defense.
   The emotions in Overtown, meanwhile, didn't signal a solution to
longstanding bitterness in the black community, several observers
said.
   Lozano's shooting of motorcyclist Lloyd and the resultant death
of passenger Blanchard in an accident caused three days of rioting
in January.
   The city continues to be racially divided and the potential for
more trouble remains, said Irby McKnight of the police Crisis
Response Team. The team was formed with black community leaders
after racial unrest 20 years ago.
   ``The conditions are still here,'' McKnight said. ``It's just
that this trial apparently is not going to be the spark that sets
it off.''
   As of early today, there were no reports of violence. Miami has
been racked by racial unrest four times this decade, including
riots in 1980 and 1984 sparked by acquittals of police charged in
the deaths of blacks.
   The January riot left one man dead and 11 others wounded.
Thirteen buildings were set afire, others were looted, and 372
people were arrested.
   Black leaders praised Judge Joseph Farina's decision to allow
blacks on the jury and to try Lozano in Miami.
   ``I think the black community is maturing,'' said police chief
Anderson, who announced his support for the trial's outcome but
praised his officers soon after the verdict.
   Some police officers cried when they heard the verdict against
Lozano, whose wife and two brothers are also in the department.
   Many felt he never should have been arrested, much less
convicted, said Miami police spokesman Angelo Bitsis.
   ``The police department is like a brotherhood, and one of their
brothers has fallen on hard times now,'' he said.

to carry on killing,'' said the South African Council of Churches.
``The de Klerk government has denied the people justice.''
   De Klerk on Thursday night brushed aside opposition demands for
an independent inquiry into charges that police took part in death
squads that killed opponents of the white-led government.
   He said such a special investigation would take too long and
that country's regular legal system would do the job just as well.
   ``A judicial inquiry can take months, if not years, to reach its
final conclusions,'' de Klerk said. ``In the meanwhile, a climate
of suspicion and distrust could develop, something the country can
ill afford at this stage in its history.''
   Several police officers, some active and some retired, will be
investigated and five have requested suspension from duty until
investigations or legal proceedings are completed, de Klerk and
Adriaan Vlok, the law and order minister, said in statements
released early today.
   Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee said two former security
policemen whose allegations prompted the inquiry would be
prosecuted. One of them awaits execution for an unrelated murder,
and the other has fled the country.
   ``The government has full confidence that the tried and
respected prosecution mechanisms of the state will be sufficient to
bring the accused before the court, impartially and objectively,''
de Klerk in response to opposition demands that the investigation
be conducted outside the law enforcement establishment.
   South Africa's national police have been criticized for failing
to solve dozens of killings of anti-government activists since
1978. Anti-apartheid leaders say many people believe security
personnel help plan, participate in, or cover up such actions.
   The council said de Klerk's claim that a judicial inquiry would
be too lengthy was ``cynical and spurious.''
   ``How long did the victims of the death squads have to wait
before the South African government was forced by present
revelations to even make a pronouncement on the matter?'' the
statement asked.
   Three former security policemen have said in recent newspaper
interviews or sworn affidavits that they participated in death
squad operations on orders of superiors, many of whom still occupy
high positions in the police.
   The former policemen, two black and one white, said they were
involved in bombings, arson, kidnapping, robbery and murder in
South Africa and neighboring countries.
   One, Almond Nofomela, is awaiting execution. The others have
fled, but one is reported held by authorities in Botswana.
   Vlok's statement about what would be investigated mentioned only
Nofomela's allegations. He said ``a team of senior detectives''
would work with the attorneys general of Natal and Transvaal
provinces.

   Novelist Alexander Solzhenitsyn and other exiled
Soviets could have their citizenship restored if they request it, a
Soviet lawmaker said in an interview with the government newspaper
Izvestia.
   Alexei Yeliseyev, chairman of the Supreme Soviet's Commission on
Citizenship, said in the interview published Thursday that it was
not necessary for exiles to return to the Soviet Union in order to
get their citizenship restored.
   ``We are ready to solve positively some of the cases right away
if we have personal applications of those deprived of their
citizenship,'' he said.
   Asked if Solzhenitsyn could be among those granted restoration
of citizenship if he requested it, Yeliseyev said, ``yes.''
   Solzhenitsyn, who was stripped of his citizenship and expelled
from the country in 1974, has not requested that his citizenship be
restored.
   The author, who now lives in the U.S. state of Vermont, wrote
extensively about the bloody terror of Stalin's rule from 1924 to
1953. His best known works include ``Gulag Archipelago,'' ``One Day
in the Life of Ivan Denisovich'' and ``Cancer Ward.''
   Yeliseyev said there had been some suggestions that Solzhenitsyn
and other exiled Soviets have their citizenship restored by decree.
``It would be unfair to restore their citizenship without asking if
they want it or not,'' he said.
   In saying that many exiles could have their citizenship
restored, Yeliseyev said, ``we have to adapt to civilized
standards.''
   Several deputies in the Supreme Soviet have asked that
Solzhenitsyn's citizenship be restored, but no official action has
been taken.
   Earlier this year, the Soviet Writers' Union restored the
membership of Solzhenitsyn and Mstislav Rostropovich, a musician.

   JAN. 17 _ Patrick Purdy, a troubled 24-year-old drifter, attacks
a Stockton, Calif., schoolyard firing an AK-47 semi-automatic
assault rifle and other weapons. Five children are killed and 29
others and one teacher are wounded. Purdy then turned a pistol on
himself.
   APRIL 14 _ Seven people die during a murderous rampage in Sonoma
County, Calif. Ramon Salcido, a former winery worker, is accused of
killing his wife, his two daughters, his mother-in-law, her two

people. Salcido was captured in Mexico five days after the slayings
and allegedly confessed to Mexican authorities. He pleaded innocent
to charges in California and will be tried in January.
   JULY 12 _ In a two-hour killing spree, a French farmer drives
around the village of Verne, France, shooting at everyone he sees.
Christian Dornier, described as strange and brooding by fellow
villagers, kills 14 people, including his mother and sister, and
injures 10. Dornier was wounded in a shootout that ended the spree.
   SEPT. 14 _ A disgruntled ex-employee armed with semi-automatic
weapons stalks workers in a printing plant in Louisville, Ky.,
killing eight and wounding 12. The gunman, Joseph T. Wesbecker, a
47-year-old pressman who was placed on permanent disability leave
from the company in 1988 because of mental illness, killed himself.
   DEC. 6 _ Fourteen women are killed and 13 other people wounded
when a man who said feminists ``spoiled my life'' storms into the
University of Montreal engineering school and opens fire with a

<TEXT>
   Rabbi Davin Schoenberger, a Jewish
scholar and poet who performed the marriage of Anne Frank's parents
before fleeing Nazi Germany, has died at age 92.
   Schoenberger died Tuesday at University Hospital.
   The chief rabbi of Aachen, Germany, from 1926 until 1938,
Schoenberger married the parents of the Jewish teen-ager who wrote
a wartime diary read worldwide after she died in a Nazi
concentration camp.
   In this country, one of Schoenberger's poems, ``Six Million
Jews,'' is widely used in Holocaust memorial ceremonies.
   Schoenberger and his wife were held briefly by the Nazis after
Kristallnacht, the night of Nov. 9, 1938, when government-incited
mobs throughout Germany attacked Jews and burned and looted
synagogues and other Jewish properties.
   ``He watched his synagogue burn to the ground,'' recalled his
wife, Ilse F. Schoenberger.
   The Schoenbergers and their young daughter fled Europe and
settled in the United States. His chief pulpit was in Chicago, but
he later served Temple Mishkan Israel, a small congregation in
Selma. He had lived in suburban Mountain Brook since his retirement
in 1960.
   ``Some ministers stay in the study and hit the books all the
time, but my father was a great spiritual counselor,'' said his
daughter, Elaine S. Katz of Tuscaloosa.
   ``I had great respect for his scholarship, and he was a very
gentle person, and very sensitive to the problems of people,'' said
Rabbi Milton Grafman, rabbi emeritus of Temple Emanu-El, where
Schoenberger was a member.
   Funeral services were scheduled for today at the temple.
Schoenberger is survived by his wife, daughter and three
grandchildren.

refused the youth pointed the toy pistol at his face and pulled the
trigger, Raimondi said.
   ``He did it so calmly, so matter-of-fact,'' the 33-year-old
Raimondi said. ``To him it was just a funny joke, but I tell you
honestly, some of these kids are selling drugs, and it could have
been a real gun.''
   The youths were later found in a video game arcade and charged
as juveniles.

   A man who killed 14 women at the University of
Montreal had a deep fear of being rejected by women and once hoped
to attend the engineering school where he carried out his suicidal
rampage, police say.
   The bizarre shooting spree by Marc Lepine, described as a bright
but jobless loner who had an apparent hatred for women in general
and feminists in particular, sparked new calls to tighten Canada's
weapons laws.
   Armed with a semi-automatic rifle, the 25-year-old Lepine walked
through the engineering school Wednesday afternoon, singling out
women and shooting them. He killed 14 and wounded nine, plus
wounded four men, before killing himself.
   Police found a three-page suicide note that blamed feminists for
his troubles. They pieced together a troubling profile of a man
whose father ran out on the family when he was a boy, whose life
was a succession of failures.
   The modern university that rests on a hill overlooking the city
was stunned after the massacre, the worst mass slayings in Canadian
history. About 2,000 mourners held a wrenching candlelight vigil
Thursday evening in Montreal, and people held memorials for the
dead in Ottawa, Toronto and Edmonton, Alberta.
   The school was closed Thursday in mourning. Final exams set for
Thursday were pushed back four days.
   Police spent more than a day trying to confirm the identity of
the killer, who signed his handwritten suicide note only as
``Marc.''
   Police spokesman Andre Tessier told a news conference Thursday
night that Lepine had trouble developing relationships with women
and broke off all communication at the first sign of rejection.
   If things weren't going well with a woman ``he would just stop
the relationship right there and never come back to the person he
was talking with,'' said Jacques Duchesneau, a police investigator.
   ``He didn't have any girlfriends,'' the detective said.
   ``I think he blamed women in general, saying that if his life
was ruined it was mainly because of women,'' Duchesneau said.
   Duchesneau said the Lepine's letter included a list of 15 Quebec
women, some of them prominent, but the significance was not clear.
   ``He only gave a list of names, period.,'' the detective said.
``We're trying to figure why those names were chosen.''
   Duchesneau, who said the information about Lepine came from
numerous sources, said Lepine was fascinated by war movies. His
suicide note said he tried to join the armed forces but was
rejected ``because he was anti-social.''
   Duchesneau described Lepine as intelligent but added he had
suffered a number of academic setbacks and had been fired from a
job in a Montreal-area hospital.
   Lepine had taken courses with the aim of entering the
engineering school of the University of Montreal, but there was no
indication he applied there, Tessier said.
   Police said that according to the suicide letter, Lepine said he
was going to commit the massacre because ``feminists have always
ruined my life.''
   The letter also made a reference to another mass murderer, Cpl.
Denis Lortie, jailed for life for the killing of three people and
wounding of 13 in the Quebec legislature in 1984.
   According to Duchesneau, Lepine's letter said Lortie had made a
political statement and that Lepine believed ``he was only doing
what Mr. Lortie did.''
   The officials said the man's name at birth was Gamil Gharbi but
he took his mother's surname and the name Marc in 1982. His
Algerian father, who now lives abroad, had left the family when
Lepine was 7 years old.
   Police said Lepine's mother and sister still live in Montreal,
and they said he had lived with a male friend.
   Lepine bought the .223-calibre Sturm Ruger, the semi-automatic
rifle he used, in a hunting store on Nov. 21, the police spokesmen
said.
   In Ottawa, Justice Minister Doug Lewis said he would move to ban
the import of military assault rifles, such as Uzis and AK-47s, but
not the hunting rifle used by the gunman.
   Automatic weapons are banned in Canada but semi-automatics are
available with the proper permit.
   Police said the gunman first shot a woman in a second-floor
corridor, then entered a room on that floor where a class with
about 50 male and 10 female students was in session.
   Witnesses said he told the class to separate by sex and sent the
men into the corridor before opening fire on the women, killing
six. Police said he then went to the first floor, killed three
women in a cafeteria, then entered a third-floor classroom where he
killed four women and then himself.

   The army ordered at least 1 million
Palestinians confined to their homes in the occupied territories to
head off any violence marking the second anniversary today of the
Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule.
   Also today, government leaders approved sending Israel's foreign
minister to U.S.-sponsored peace talks.
   Army forces were bolstered along the borders with Lebanon,
Jordan and Egypt to block any infiltration attempts by Palestinian
guerrillas in support of the uprising in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
   Scattered violence, including stone throwing, occurred in the
West Bank. Soldiers immediately clamped curfews on an additional
six refugee camps and three villages that are home to more than
40,000 Palestinians, an army spokesman said.
   The 750,000 people of Gaza Strip were kept under curfew for a
second day and the 120,000 people of Nablus, the West Bank's
largest city, were ordered to remain at home for an eighth day,
along with 50,000 refugees from camps near the city.
   Also under curfew were Bethlehem's 35,000 Palestinian residents
and 6,000 residents in Kalandia refugee camp near Jerusalem.
   Two people were shot and wounded in Gaza for violating the
curfew, according to Arab reports.
   About 300 Palestinians demonstrated in Jerusalem's Old City
outside the Al Aqsa Mosque, one of Islam's holiest sites, chanting
``PLO, Israel No'' and waving outlawed Palestinian flags, Arab
witnesses said.
   The demonstrators carried signs from the PLO and the Moslem
fundamentalist group Hamas, or Zeal. ``Congratulations to the
intefadeh,'' one placard read. Police stationed on nearby rooftops
did not intervene and the demonstration ended quietly, the
witnesses said.
   Jewish settlers drove through the West Bank hanging
blue-and-white Israeli flags from utility poles and scrawling
slogans on Arab-owned homes to assert their right to the disputed
land.
   ``We will fight to the end,'' said one slogan written in Hebrew
on a wall in Bethlehem.
   Border police were seen removing the flags and painting over the
settlers' graffiti, despite shouted protests from Israelis driving
through Bethlehem from settlements to Jerusalem.
   Israel's four senior leaders met today in Jerusalem and agreed
to U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III's proposal for a
meeting with his Israeli and Egyptian counterparts as a first step
in the Middle East peace process.
   Baker urged such a meeting in Washington to lead to
Israeli-Palestinian talks on Israel's proposal for elections in the
occupied territories.
   Cabinet Secretary Eliakim Rubinstein said the leaders of the
coalition government agreed to send Foreign Minister Moshe Arens to
the meeting but wanted preliminary talks first to decide the time
and whether it would be in Washington.
   Today's meeting was attended by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
and Arens of the right-wing Likud bloc and Finance Minister Shimon
Peres and Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin of the center-left Labor
Party.
   The Israeli plan calls for 1.7 million Palestinians in the
occupied lands to elect representatives for talks with Israel about
interim self-rule. The final status of the lands would be decided
later.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization has criticized the
proposal since it is designed to bypass the PLO and fails to
guarantee eventual Palestinian statehood, the main aim of the
rebellion.
   The intefadeh, as the uprising is called in Arabic, began Dec.
8, 1987, with riots in the Jabaliya refugee camp in the Gaza Strip.
The violence was set off when an army truck collided with a van,
killing four Palestinians. Rumors spread through the camp that it
was no accident but, instead, revenge for the stabbing death of a
Jewish businessman three days earlier.
   The next day, soldiers opened fire on protesting students in the
camp after a firebomb was hurled at an army patrol.
   Two Palestinians were killed, the first of 626 to die in the
uprising. Forty-three Israelis have also died in the violence, and
155 other Palestinians have been slain by fellow Arabs as suspected
collaborators.

   The Communist Party's Central Committee will hold
an extraordinary meeting Saturday to set the agenda for the Soviet
Union's parliament next week, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said
today.
   Journalists said the committee will discuss economic problems
and possibly the growing challenges to party authority, including a
vote in Lithuania that revoked the Communists' constitutionally
guaranteed monopoly on power.
   Although the policy-making body recently began announcing dates
of its meetings in advance, the official media carried no word of a
Saturday session.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfiliev said it was
traditional for the Central Committee to meet before the convening
of the Soviet Congress of People's Deputies ``to discuss matters
pertaining to the Congress.''
   The 2,250-member Soviet parliament opens the second session in
its history Tuesday. The Central Committee also met before the
inaugural session of the Congress in May to consider its agenda.
   A plenum of the Central Committee is used to consider specific
questions or to make personal changes. The body is empowered to
remove members of the ruling Politburo, but there was no indication
that was in the works.
   Harry Tiido, a commentator on official Estonian radio, said the
Baltic republic's party leader, Vaino Vyalas, told Estonian
television Thursday ``he was going to Moscow, and that questions of
the economy would be discussed.''
   Tiido, speaking by telephone from the Estonian capital, Tallinn,
said some Communists there believed the Central Committee would
also consider the Lithuanian Supreme Soviet legislature's vote
Thursday to revoke the Communist Party's constitutionally
guaranteed monopoly on power.
   By its vote, Lithuania became the first of the 15 constituent
Soviet republics to replace the traditional legal guarantee of
Communist supremacy with a system of multiple parties.

   A car slammed into a bus carrying
about 60 people to a Christmas concert, killing the three men in
the car and injuring eight on the bus, police said.
   The driver and seven passengers on the bus were treated at
Pontiac General Hospital after the wreck Thursday evening. One
remained hospitalized today with broken ribs and the rest were
treated and released, said police Sgt. Jerry Knapp said.
   The bus, taking employees from a grocery store chain to a
Christmas outing to see singer Marie Osmond, was hit by the car as
the bus turned into a parking lot, police said. The bus frame
twisted, crushing the car as it came to rest under the rear of the
bus.
   The men were removed from the mangled car by rescuers using
``jaws of life'' equipment and pronounced dead at the scene, Knapp
said. Knapp said he didn't know who was at fault in the crash.
   Victims of the crash were identified as Robert Lowry, 39, of
Lake Orion and John Breeze II, 38, and Edward French, 36, both of
Pontiac, Knapp said.

<HEAD>Groups Object to Mixed-Religion Holiday Cards</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Greeting cards that blend Hannukah and Christmas
religious symbols are objectionable, say two groups representing
Christians and Jews.
   The American Jewish Committee and the National Conference of
Christians and Jews criticized such mixed cards as ``an affront to
Judaism, to Christianity, and to serious interfaith relations.''
   ``To combine the religious and cultural symbols of Hannukah and
Christmas in greeting card art is to diminish the sacred symbols of
each faith,'' the organizations said Wednesday in a statement
released by the AJC.
   ``Greeting cards that mingle Santas and menorahs, angels, trees,
stockings and Stars of David, are objectionable,'' the statement
said.
   ``My concern is that people are going to say, `Well, there are
these two winter holidays, what's the difference between them,
let's send out a kind of greeting card that will bridge the two,''
said Judith Banki, deputy director of the AJC's interreligious
affairs department.
   Banki, stressing that the groups aim to raise people's
consciousness and not accuse any particular company, cited three
examples she found in a store.
   One card showed a menorah with the words ``Holiday Greetings;''
inside the menorah was sitting atop a Christmas Tree. Another
showed two men of similar appearance side by side, one in a
yarmulke holding a menorah and one in Santa Claus garb, with the
words ``Have a splendid whatever.'' A third showed a Christmas
angel lighting a Hannukah menorah, which sat on a fireplace also
decorated with holly. That one read ``Happy Holidays.''
   Banki said two of the cards she cited were by Recycled Paper
Products Inc., of Chicago; the third was labeled Mixed Blessing, of
Scarsdale.
   ``I'm surprised they take exception to it on such rigid basis,
since this is a melting pot country,'' said Mike Keiser, co-owner
of Recycled Paper Products. ``I'd like to think there's room for
all kinds of religious expressions, even if they're polyglot
expressions.''
   Keiser, noting that he is Presbyterian and his partner, Phil
Friedmann, is Jewish, said their company has issued mixed cards for
at least five years to a large market and had never before heard a
complaint. But Keiser said he would take the organizations' appeal
into consideration.
   There was no listing for Mixed Blessing in the telephone
directory or with the Greeting Card Association in Washington.

<HEAD>Witness Says His Group Handled Millions in Drug Money Monthly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAFAYETTE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government witness testified that an
organization he formed with Panamanian Gen. Manuel Noriega and
others laundered $50 million to $100 million in drug money monthly
for the Medellin drug cartel.
   Stephen Kalish, imprisoned as a repeat offender in drug
enterprises, is testifying for the government in U.S. District
Court against 23 men accused of smuggling marijuana and cocaine
into the United States.
   In Thursday's testimony, Kalish said the group he set up with
Noriega received a 5 percent commission for laundering drug money
for the Ochoa family of Colombia. Law enforcement officials
describe the Ochoas as co-leaders of the Medellin drug cartel.
   Kalish, who has claimed a close relationship with Noriega, said
he once purchased a $2 million helicopter for the Panamanian
dictator.
   When arrested in 1984, Kalish said, he sent a letter to Noriega
promising to keep the operation secret.
   ``I told him I wouldn't disclose his activities to the U.S.
government, and I was sorry I didn't tell him I was a federal
fugitive,'' he said.
   The United States has been using political and economic pressure
in an effort to oust Noriega since he was indicted on drug
trafficking charges in February 1988 by federal grand juries in
Miami and Tampa, Fla.
   Kalish said under his 1987 plea bargain with federal prosecutors
in Florida, he agreed to forfeit $2.8 million in assets but the
government can seize any other assets it can find.
   Judge John Shaw ruled Wednesday that defense attorneys may ask
Kalish about any smuggling profits he kept but cannot ask where he
hid the money.

<HEAD>Officials Say Mrs. Aquino Must Move Swiftly to Retain Economic Progress</HEAD>

   President Bush is voicing strong, no-strings
support for Philippine President Corazon Aquino, but other U.S.
backers say she must act firmly to regain control in the wake of a
failed coup if she is to restore confidence and keep alive the
economic growth key to her country's future.
   Departing from the prepared text of a speech at a political
fund-raiser in Houston on Thursday night, the president said:
   ``Just last week democracy was challenged in the Philippines.
And we stood with President Aquino and we continue to stand with
her and with democracy now. We must not let the democratic process
be overthrown by revolution and by military takeover.''
   ``Obviously we would like to see the Aquino government be able
to solidify its position to avoid a repetition of this,'' House
Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said after a White House meeting
with Bush earlier Thursday.
   ``We're sympathetic to her as a democratically elected leader,
and we hope that she can take whatever action is necessary to
ensure that this kind of open military challenge does not
reoccur,'' said Foley, reflecting the discomfort many U.S.
officials felt over the surprisingly strong coup attempt.
   The Philippines, struggling with widespread rural poverty and a
$28 billion international debt, has pinned its hopes on attracting
outside capital and trade. With Japan leading the way, the country
has benefited from a multibillion-dollar international economic
development program.
   But those hopes, which have grown during the 3{ years since Mrs.
Aquino was elected to replace dictator Ferdinand Marcos, rest
heavily on political stability.
   Mrs. Aquino herself has been dogged by accusations of
incompetence and her government by charges it has failed to weed
out corruption and address rural poverty.
   One congressional official closely involved in U.S. policy
toward the Philippines said any hesitancy on Mrs. Aquino's part in
dealing with dissident military officers who carried out the coup
could damage economic growth.
   ``If she is seen as vacillating and not moving vigorously
against the coup plotters, that is really going to be a blow to
investor confidence,'' said the official, who spoke only on
condition of anonymity.
   Mrs. Aquino must do more than she did in 1987, when coup leaders
generally went unpunished and the government made concessions to
the rebellious military faction, the official said.
   ``The only conclusion for investors is that if she doesn't move
against these guys, they could do it again, and next time they
might succeed,'' he said.
   ``These events will slow things down in the minds of at least
some potential investors,'' said John Callebaut, director of the
U.S.-Philippine Business Committee, an arm of the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce.
   But Callebaut said that during a tour the past two weeks to
interest U.S. electronics companies in investing in the
Philippines, he saw little change in attitude because of the
attempted coup. The companies ``have a longer-term interest in the
Philippines, and there is a recognition that this is of a
short-term nature,'' he said.
   At the White House and the State Department there were
reassurances Thursday of U.S. backing for Mrs. Aquino.
   ``Mrs. Aquino's government has shown incredible resilience in
this situation,'' said State Department spokesman Richard Boucher.
   He noted that after a serious coup attempt in August 1987 there
were pessimistic predictions about investor confidence which never
came true. ``Stability returned rather quickly,'' with an annual
growth rate of 6 percent, Boucher said.
   But another department official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, acknowledged the latest coup will give pause to
companies contemplating expanding to the Philippines.
   ``In addition to being disruptive and destructive and unhealthy
for the democratic process, it raises questions in people's minds:
Is the environment stable? Is the situation secure? Is this a good
place to put money?'' the official said.
   ``She already had a tough job, and it's become tougher. But it's
not impossible.''

   A three-story-high Santa Claus was felled
by an arrow shot by vandals, and the inflatable St. Nick may face
an even more formidable foe _ the city building inspector.
   The giant Santa, complete with a lighted belly, acted as a
beacon for a Christmas tree lot until it was punctured Wednesday
night.
   ``We were out there to wait on some people when we heard this
thump,'' said David Shepard, owner of the tree lot. ``We looked
around and there were these guys screaming, `We hit the balloon!'''
   The damage to the $7,000 balloon is minor, and Shepard said
Thursday he expected Santa to be up and about in a day or so. No
one was arrested.
   But just hours before the shooting, city building inspector
Matthias Mulvey said he might order the wind knocked out of the
giant Santa for violating height restrictions. He said the balloon
is technically a sign and requires a special permit from the zoning
board.

<TEXT>
   Senior Israeli officials said today that Iraq's
reported launch of long-range missiles capable of carrying
satellites into space could be dangerous for the region.
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, expressed
concern that President Saddam Hussein's regime could use such
missiles for chemical, biological or nuclear warheads.
   Iraqi radio announced on Thursday that a three-stage rocket was
launched Tuesday morning from the Al Anbar Space Research Center 50
miles west of Baghdad. It said the missiles had a range of 1,240
miles.
   An Israeli military source confirmed there was a launching but
gave no details. ``It's true, but the implications are not yet
clear,'' said the source who demanded anonymity.
   The U.S. State Department said it had heard reports Iraq had
developed intercontinental ballistic missile but knew nothing about
their validity.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's government issued no formal
statement. But officials said privately that an enhanced Iraqi
missile capability would have a destabilizing effect on the region.
   ``It could lead to a dangerous situation,'' said one official,
adding Israel might raise the issue in its diplomatic contacts.
   ``Israel is following with concern the development of
unconventional armament in the Arab world in general and in Iraq in
particular,'' the official said. ``Iraq has a record of using
indiscriminately all kinds of unconventional weapons, chemical and
other.''
   Israeli officials refused to reply to questions about whether
preemptive action might be necessary to forestall development of an
Iraqi missile. In June 1981, Israeli planes destroyed the Osirak
atomic plant being built near Baghdad to prevent Hussein from
developing a nuclear weapons capability.
   Independent analysts said Iraq's launching could trigger a
missile race in the region, but they said Baghdad still had a long
way to go before it could put a spy satellite in space or threaten
Israel's technological supremacy.
   Gerald Steinberg, a weapons systems expert at Hebrew University,
told Israel radio that optical systems, telemetry and other
sophisticated systems for a satellite ``are almost completely
beyond the Iraqi capability now and in the near future.''
   He said the launching may have been primarily to boost Iraq's
image, in which case the military impact would be minimal.
   But he said it could mean Iraq has developed the ability to
produce and deploy its own missiles five or 10 years faster than
expected.
   Israel launched its own satellite, called Ofek (Horizon)-1, on
Sept. 19, 1988, and is reportedly working on a second.

<TEXT>
   French mercenary Bob Denard and
his corps of European soldiers who now control the Coromo Islands
are likely to leave within a month because of domestic and foreign
pressure, a South African diplomat said today.
   Marco Boni, South Africa's trade representative, noted that both
South Africa and France _ the largest donors of aid to the Indian
Ocean nation _ had suspended all assistance.
   ``I think Denard knows he has to go,'' Boni said in an
interview. ``The joint South African-French action should be an
indication that it is time for him to leave.''
   Various diplomatic sources have alleged that Denard or his men
were involved in the Nov. 26 assassination of President Ahmed
Abdallah Abderrahmane. Denard, 60, has denied the allegation and
insisted that he will not be forced from the islands, located off
the southeast coast of Africa near Madagascar.
   A mass rally against Denard has been planned for Saturday at the
main mosque in Moroni. On Thursday, 1,000 youths protested in the
capital against Denard, and the mercenary-led presidential guard
dispersed them with tear gas and clubs.
   Boni said Denard's presence would make it difficult for the
country to hold free elections to choose a new president.
   He said South African officials had not negotiated with Denard
about possible exile in South Africa but might offer him temporary
refuge there. He said Denard owned a home in South Africa.
   On Thursday, the mercenaries expelled 11 foreign correspondents
after seizing their notebooks, film and cassette tapes and accusing
them of inciting anti-government demonstrations.
   They confined the journalists to their hotel in Moroni for four
hours before driving them to the airport for an Air France flight
to Nairobi, said Gary Streiker, one of the expelled reporters. He
is the Nairobi-based Africa correspondent for the American
television Cable News Network.
   Those expelled Thursday included reporters for CNN, the Reuters
and Agence France-Presse news agencies, the Daily Telegraph of
London, Radio France Internationale and the Sygma photo news
agency, said Streiker.
   Denard has not made any public statement on what he is doing or
why. Boni said Denard told him that if the people demanded he
should leave, he would.
   Denard has lived in the Comoros for 16 years, married a local
woman, and adopted the national religion, Islam. He also has
extensive property holdings.
   He has denied reports that he was involved in Abdallah's death,
but sources told The Associated Press that the two men had
quarreled recently, in particular over continued funding of the
Presidential Guard, which has given Denard his power and influence
in the islands.
   Denard led a coup in 1975 that ousted Abdallah from power
shortly after the Comoran president declared independence from
France.
   In 1978, with the blessing of the French and South African
government, Denard led another coup which brought Abdallah back to
power, ending the chaotic, Maoist rule of Ali Soilij, who was shot
to death.

   Karl R. Bauman, a longtime newsman with The

from cancer complications at age 87.
   Bauman was a 38-year AP employee. He worked for 32 years in the
news service's Washington bureau, covering major federal trials and
the U.S. Supreme Court before moving onto the White House, where he
covered the Kennedy administration and Johnson's 1964 campaign.
   Johnson sent Bauman a letter on his retirement, noting his
three-decade career in the nation's capital.
   Bauman's departure from the press corps was marked with ``the
biggest retirement party of anyone in Washington I ever knew in the

<TEXT>
   Inmates rioted at four prisons today after
lawmakers rejected a proposed amnesty for repeat offenders, and at
least three prisoners were beaten and stabbed to death, authorities
said.
   At one prison, 1,000 inmates tried to escape, the state-run PAP
news agency said. Violence began Thursday night or early today at
four maximum-security prisons, said Jerzy Rybarczyk, spokesman for
the Central Board of Penitentiaries in Warsaw.
   At Czarne Prison ``prisoners started destroying equipment, set
warehouse facilities on fire, and attacked prison guards who tried
to get the situation under control,'' PAP said.
   The rebellious inmates dumped three battered and stabbed
prisoners at the main gate of the prison, PAP said. Two were dead
and the third died en route to the hospital.
   The prison houses 1,500 hard-core inmates near Slupsk on the
Baltic coast. ``It is suspected that the situation was used to
settle accounts among the prisoners,'' PAP said.
   The situation inside the prison remained out of control today,
with about 1,000 prisoners attempting at one point to force open
the main gate, PAP said.
   Guards and police surrounded the exterior of the prison to
prevent any escapes, PAP said, quoting a corrections official, Col.
Tadeusz Judycki.
   About 700 prisoners revolted at the Goleniow Prison near
Szczecin in northwest Poland, where inmates seized two cellblocks
and set a fire, and more unrest was reported at Kaminsk Prison,
near Olsztyn in north-central Poland, Rybarczyk said.
   Inmates also staged a protest at Nowogard, also near Szczecin,
but Rybarczyk said he had no further details.
   The riots began after the lower house of Parliament, the Sejm,
rejected a Senate proposal to extend an amnesty to habitual
criminals.
   Czarne, Goleniow and Kaminsk house hard-core prisoners who had
hoped that an amnesty approved by the lower house Nov. 16 would be
extended to include them. The Senate urged widening the amnesty so
that it would no longer exclude repeat offenders, major thieves and
those convicted of vehicular manslaughter under influence of
alcohol.
   The Senate proposal aroused widespread debate among Poles who
feared it would lead to a wholesale release of criminals at a time
when crime rates are rising. The Sejm, after a lengthy debate,
rejected the Senate proposal.
   The original amnesty passed by the Sejm will take effect. In
general, it suspends sentences of under two years for
unpremeditated crimes and under three years for premeditated crimes.
   Death sentences were reduced to 25 years in prison, 25-year
terms were reduced to 15 years, and other sentences were reduced by
one-third to one-half.
   The amnesty applied to crimes committed before Sept. 12, the day
the government controlled by members of the Solidarity labor
movement took control. It is the first non-Communist-led government
in the Soviet bloc.
   The idea behind the amnesty was to extend to prisoners a second
chance under Poland's new political climate, advocates said.

<HEAD>Loral Corp. Pleads Guilty to Three Felony Counts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New York-based Loral Corp. pleaded
guilty to three felony counts today for its attempts to influence
improperly the award of two defense contracts.
   The company admitted that it paid defense consultant William M.
Galvin $578,000 to obtain confidential bid information about an Air
Force advanced radar warning contract and a Navy contract to build
a blimp.
   The company agreed to pay $5.77 million in fines, civil
penalties and reimbursement for the cost of the investigation. A
plea agreement between the Justice Department and Loral was
approved by U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton.
   Meanwhile, a former Sperry Corp. official admitted approving
bribes to a former Navy procurement official, Garland L. Tomlin, Jr.
   James J. Thompson pleaded guilty to conspiracy and bribery and
faces a possible 25-year sentence.
   The Loral admission implicated two former Pentagon officials who
have not been charged in the Justice Department's continuing
investigation of defense fraud, nicknamed Operation Ill Wind.
   According to a statement of facts filed by prosecutors, former
Air Force procurement official Victor D. Cohen gave Galvin inside
information about the advanced radar warning system for F-16
aircraft.
   Melvyn R. Paisley, then an assistant Navy secretary for research
engineering and systems, provided Galvin with information about the
Navy airship contract, according to the statement.
   Paisley also made modifications in bid requirements that were
favorable to the company's bid, the statement said.
   Loral had obtained the airship division from Goodyear Tire and
Rubber Co. The scheme to improperly influence the airship contract
began before the defense industry division had been obtained from
Goodyear.
   Galvin, who has not been charged, relayed information to Loral
officials about both contracts that he had obtained from his
Pentagon contacts, according to the statement. Loral admitted that
it billed the government for the money it paid Galvin's companies
by submitting bogus vouchers for defense studies it falsely claimed
Galvin was conducting.
   In a statement, the company said it had suspended two
individuals it did not identify and had disciplined two others.
   ``This regrettable incident should not have occurred at Loral,''
said Bernard L. Schwartz, the company's chairman and chief
executive officer. ``We are satisfied that Loral has procedures and
controls in place to provide the best protection from anything like
this occurring again.''
   As part of the deal, Loral will retain the radar warning
contract but must bear a greater share of the cost overruns.
   A 1992 procurement for some $70 million worth of radar warning
equipment will now be placed for competitive bidding.
   Hilton, meanwhile, scheduled Thompson's sentencing for Feb. 16.
The former Sperry official admitted that he approved payments to
Tomlin after another Sperry official, Frank Lavelle, suggested the
arrangement.
   The bribery scheme was also known to Charles F. Gardner, a
former vice president of Sperry and its successor, Unisys Corp.
Gardner has pleaded guilty for his role in the Pentagon procurement
scandal.
   Tomlin, who has returned most of the money he received in
bribes, received an 18-month sentence for his guilty plea.

<TEXT>
   The unemployment rate edged up from 5.3
percent to 5.4 percent in November even though the economy added
210,000 new jobs and manufacturing employment fell for the eighth
consecutive month, the government said today.
   The Labor Department report showed job growth last month was far
greater than most analysts expected. But the government also
revised downward sharply the number of new nonfarm jobs created in
October, from 233,000 to 93,000.
   The civilian unemployment rate climbed 0.1 percentage point as
more than 6.7 million Americans were looking for jobs but unable to
find them. That data comes from the department's household survey,
which also showed that 117.7 million people held jobs in the
civilian economy.
   The stock market reacted favorably to the report, taking the
evidence of sluggish growth as a sign the Federal Reserve Board
would move to further relax its credit policy and thus lower
interest rates.
   Analysts, however, were split on whether or when such a
reduction would come, and at odds as well over whether the economy
was on the verge of recession.
   ``I don't think these numbers suggest further easing,'' said
Washington economist Michael Evans. ``The economy is moving along
in second gear. It's not very weak and it's not very strong.''
   But Allen Sinai, chief economist for Boston Co. Economic
Advisers, said the manufacturing sector was clearly in a recession
and appeared to be having a spillover effect on certain services
industries that could bring a full recession.
   ``I think this is it,'' Sinai said. ``This economy is at or near
some sort of recession.'' He predicted the Fed would reduce
interest rates but said it was unclear whether the central bank
would move immediately or wait until its year-end meeting in 10
days.
   The manufacturing slump has contributed to the overall slowdown
in the economy as the year draws to a close, and today's report
provided further evidence that the sector's lackluster performance
continues.
   The average manufacturing work week fell from 40.8 to 40.7 hours
and overtime was unchanged at an average of 3.7 hours a week.
   The department said the dramatic revision of October's job
growth number resulted from overestimating new hiring in state and
local educational institutions, which is difficult to measure as
the school year begins.
   With that revision taken into account, the government said the
average month-to-month gain in jobs during the second half of 1989
has been about 160,000, well below the average monthly gain of
270,000 posted in the past 2{ years.
   Virtually all of the growth in the past year has been in the
service sector, and November was no exception.
   Wholesale and retail trade posted job gains of 18,000 and
33,000, respectively, last month and business and health services
also reported significant payroll expansions.
   But the outlook in the goods-producing sector, particularly
manufacturing, was not as good.
   Mining and construction reported modest employment gains last
month, adding 7,000 and 17,000 positions, respectively.
   Exacerbating the decline in manufacturing was another bad month
for automobile manufacturing, which reported a decline of 15,000
jobs in November after losing 10,000 from September to October.
   That decline caused overall employment in the durable-goods
sector of manufacturing to slip by 24,000 jobs last month.
   The Labor Department said manufacturing employment has declined
by 165,000 since March, with auto and electrical equipment
accounting for 100,000 of the lost jobs.
   Analysts had predicted the report would show about 150,000 new
jobs last month, and the larger figure would appear to indicate
that the economy is strong enough that the Federal Reserve need not
reduce interest rates further.
   The sharp October job revision, however, and the continued slump
in manufacturing could give the Fed policymakers enough evidence
that the slowdown has reached a dangerous point and that lower
interest rates might help spark more robust growth.
   The central bank's chief concern about easing interest rates
centers on inflation, and today's report contained somewhat
encouraging news on that front.
   Average hourly earnings were unchanged in November, and average
weekly earnings declined by 0.4 percent. Over the year, hourly
earnings have increased by 3.6 percent and average weekly earnings
by 3.0 percent. Both of those gains lag well behind consumer
inflation, which has been in the annual range of 4.5 percent.
   The 5.4 percent civilian jobless rate was the highest since it
was 5.4 percent in January. For the past six months the rate had
been either 5.3 percent or 5.2 percent.
   The rate increased despite the moderately strong addition of
210,000 nonfarm jobs because the labor force _ those with jobs or
actively seeking them _ expanded by 410,000 people last month after
growing by just 65,000 from September to October.
   The unemployment rates among major demographic groups changed
little for the most part in November, although joblessness for all
teen-agers shot up from 14.9 percent to 15.5 percent.
   The rates among other groups were:
   _Adult white men, 4.0 percent, up from 3.8 percent in October.
   _Adult white women, 4.0 percent, unchanged.
   _White teen-agers, 11.2 percent, up from 10.4 percent.
   _All blacks, 12.1 percent, up from 11.8 percent.
   _Adult black men, 10.7 percent, up from 10.3 percent.

   The NAACP is planning to march and to mount
political, economic and educational efforts in a racially torn
South Carolina county, the national chairman of the group said.
   ``We're going to put all the NAACP's resources in this,'' said
Dr. William F. Gibson, a Greenville dentist who chairs the
organization's board of directors.
   Racial tension has been rising in Horry County, which includes
the resort city of Myrtle Beach, since last summer, when a black
high school football quarterback was replaced with a less
experienced white player.
   Black players have boycotted the team since Aug. 22, and the
Horry County school board has fired the Rev. H.H. Singleton, a
Conway Middle School teacher who led the boycott. Singleton also is
president of the local chapter of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People.
   The state Human Affairs Commission has said there is evidence
that blacks are discriminated against in the Horry (pronounced
Or-ee) County school system.
   Human Affairs Commissioner Jim Clyburn said that during the last
10 years, Horry County schools have awarded 22 promotions, none of
them to blacks.
   The commission has filed a legal brief on behalf of Conway High
School band director Leslie McIver, who was passed over for a white
applicant for the job of district arts coordinator.
   The commission said McIver was more qualified than the white
person who got the job.
   The events prompted the NAACP to meet this week. Among the plans
the group settled on was to lead a protest march before the end of
the year, Gibson said. He added that he will meet with the Rev.
Jesse Jackson this week to discuss the march.
   Gibson also is planning a concentrated voter-registration drive
in the black community.
   The NAACP is planning to create an Economic Enhancement
Committee, which will encourage the hiring and promoting of blacks
and contracts for black-owned businesses.
   And the group is planning ``Freedom Schools,'' where black
students will be tutored after school in their regular academic
subjects as well as black history and the meaning of the Civil
Rights movement.

<HEAD>Mediator Optimistic About Next Round of UMW-Pittston Talks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A mediator is optimistic negotiations next
week between Pittston Co. and the United Mine Workers will lead to
a settlement of the 8-month-old strike, his spokesman said.
   But striking coal miners said they were preparing for a
Christmas without jobs and opened an indoor rally site Thursday,
Camp Solidarity II, to demonstrate their resolve.
   Negotiators for the union and company are planning to resume
mediated contract talks Monday at a motel conference room in
Arlington, said Herbert Fishgold, an associate of mediator William
Usery, former labor secretary under President Ford.
   Usery ``is optimistic that this set of talks will be the one
that leads to a settlement of this dispute,'' Fishgold said
Thursday.
   The union and company representatives held eight straight days
of negotiations, with sessions lasting from 10 to 17 hours, before
recessing Nov. 20, Usery said. They met again last Thursday and
Friday before taking a break this week.
   Usery and the negotiators needed the break to evaluate the
proposals that came forth and the complex issues involved, Fishgold
said. ``It was a time for everyone to step back and digest what
happened.''
   Citing a news blackout each party agreed to, Fishgold, Pittston
spokeswoman Susan Copeland and UMW spokesman John Duray refused
Thursday to say anything substantive about the bargaining or the
issues.
   Fishgold characterized the talks as ``amicable, forthright and
meaningful. Mr. Usery is satisfied with the way the talks have
gone, the cooperation and the obvious interest on part of both
parties to resolve this dispute.''
   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole appointed Usery on Oct. 25 as a
``super mediator'' to help solve the dispute. He runs a labor
relations firm in Washington and was national director of the
Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service from 1973 to 1976.
   The strike began April 5 and directly involved Pittston's 1,695
union employees in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky and
indirectly involved hundreds of laid-off miners.
   ``We're not going to get our hopes up and then get a big
letdown,'' said Buzz Hicks, a UMW local president from Cleveland,
Va., who was coordinating activity at Camp Solidarity, a campground
in rural Russell County. ``Personally, I don't look for anything
over the holidays.''

<HEAD>Life Term for Man Convicted of Drug Agent Murders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Taiwanese man convicted in the
slayings of two federal drug agents posing as heroin buyers has
been sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole.
   Prosecutors had urged Judge Gilbert Alston to impose the death
penalty on 20-year-old Wei Wen Wang, but Alston instead chose the
life term recommended by a Los Angeles County Superior Court jury.
He handed down the sentence Thursday.
   The government had dropped a federal indictment against Wang
because there was no federal death penalty at the time of the
crimes. The case was instead pursued in a state court because
California allows capital punishment.
   Wang was convicted of the first-degree murders of U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration agents Paul Seema, 52, and George
Montoya, 34, the attempted murder of agent Jose Martinez, 25, and
robbery.
   The jury also had found special circumstances of multiple murder
and murder during a robbery, which made the death penalty a
sentencing option.
   The Feb. 5, 1988, shootings occurred during an investigation of
heroin dealers in the San Gabriel Valley. Evidence at the trial
indicated that the agents were killed as part of a scheme to rob
them of $80,000 they had agreed to pay for two pounds of heroin.
   Two other alleged participants in the robbery and murders died
in an ensuing shootout. Wang, a native of Taiwan who lived in
Hacienda Heights, was shot in the cheek, shoulder, chest, pelvis,
forearm and thigh, but survived.
   Su Re ``Michael'' Chia, who was in on the plot but not at the
shootout, was convicted in February on two counts of first-degree
murder, attempted murder, robbery and conspiracy. He was given 62
years to life in prison.
   Former President Reagan signed a law last November allowing
federal judges to impose the death penalty for drug dealers
convicted of murder, but it did not apply to crimes committed
before it was enacted.

<HEAD>Suit Alleges Nissan Dispatched Corporate `Spy'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A couple has accused Nissan Motor Corp.
and a Japanese man who lived in their home of spying on them to
collect information on Americans' buying habits.
   In a Superior Court lawsuit, Maritza and Stephen French claim
fraud, invasion of privacy, trespassing and unfair business
practices against Nissan and Takashi Morimoto, a Nissan employee
who rented a room in their Costa Mesa home last summer.
   The family learned of Morimoto's mission in October, when the
Los Angeles Times reported that Morimoto was sent to Costa Mesa as
part of an effort to design a future car model designed especially
for the U.S. market.
   The lawsuit filed Thursday seeks a court order forbidding Nissan
from dispatching alleged corporate emissaries into the homes of
other unsuspecting families. It also seeks unspecified damages.
   ``They just feel outraged,'' said Nancy Kaufman, the French's
attorney. ``They just wonder what he was writing down, what about
their private lives is in a Nissan file somewhere. They feel
violated.''
   The complaint alleges that Morimoto, 29, ``intentionally
misrepresented and concealed'' the reason for his six-week stay
with the couple and their two daughters.
   A spokesman for Nissan Motor Corp. in Carson said he could not
comment because the firm had yet to receive the lawsuit.
   The lawsuit also named as defendants Makoto Tachikawa, a product
strategy director for Nissan, and two firms allegedly involved in
placing Morimoto in the French household.
   Ms. Kaufman said the episode began when the French family
responded to a newspaper advertisement to find homes for Japanese
students. The placement services said no students were available
but suggested Morimoto, who moved in on June 16.

   A college reporter is challenging a
court order barring him from having any contact with the president
of the student body, who contends the reporter has harassed and
threatened him.
   Dennis Olp, student body president at Scottsdale Community
College, sought the order barring Kent Davis from having any
contact with him and his family.
   The 28-year-old Olp wants Davis barred from attending Tuesday's
meeting of the Maricopa County Community District Governing Board,
which runs the college. Olp has said he plans to protest a planned
tuition increase at the meeting.
   In her restraining order, Justice of the Peace Nancy Conner made
no mention of the meeting, which Davis has said he plans to attend.
   Davis was informed of the order Wednesday in the Campus News
newsroom by two law enforcement officials.
   He has challenged the order on the basis his grades will suffer
if he loses access to student meetings. A hearing is scheduled for
Dec. 18.
   Olp maintains Davis threatened to harm him, offered someone a
bribe to lie about him, wrote untrue articles about him, made crank
phone calls and has been watching his home. Olp maintains Davis
holds a grudge for losing an election bid against him.
   Davis on Thursday denied the allegations and says he has written
his student-government stories objectively and without malice.
   Campus News faculty adviser Jim Martin said Davis had taken
Olp's criticisms of the stories in stride: ``Kent laughed about
this until yesterday when those officers came into the room. Dennis
has just refused to let this die.''

<DATELINE>COTONOU, Benin (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leadership of this West African
country, facing popular discontent and massive debt, has denounced
communism and promised to undertake constitutional reforms next
year.
   The ruling People's Revolutionary Party said Thursday it will
abandon the Marxist-Leninist ideology that has guided it for 14
years, ever since President Mathieu Kerekou declared a one-party
Marxist state.
   The announcement follows weeks of protests by civil servants and
teachers, who haven't been paid since October, and street
demonstrations by students demanding more democracy.
   The reforms will focus on a greater division of power, including
the creation of the post of prime minister. A new Constitution will
give greater powers to the 196-member National Assembly, guarantee
human rights, liberalize the economy and encourage private
enterprise.
   One of the first measures will be to abandon the formal
salutation ``comrade.''
   It was not clear whether the illegal Front for the Liberation
and Rehabilitation of Dahomey, which tried to unseat Kerekou in a
1977 coup, would be legalized or whether other opposition parties
would be permitted.
   The nation of 4.2 million people is one of the poorest in
Africa, with a per capita annual income of $310 and foreign debt of
$920 million.
   The principal sources of foreign exchange are cotton, cocoa and
oilseed.
   Benin achieved independence from France in 1960 as the
Independent Republic of Dahomey. A military regime headed by
Kekerou took power in 1972 and renamed the country the People's
Republic of Benin in 1975.

<HEAD>Radio and TV Pioneer Max Grundig Dead at 81</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   BADEN-BADEN, West Germany (AP) _ Max Grundig, the radio and
television pioneer whose electronics company grew from a small shop
to a worldwide enterprise, died Friday at the age of 81.
   Grundig died in a hospital in Baden-Baden, in West Germany's
Black Forest region, his company said. It did not give a cause of
death.
   Born May 7, 1908, Grundig began tinkering with radios as a
15-year-old apprentice in the Bavarian city of Nuremberg.
   He opened his own shop with a friend in 1930, selling radios and
producing transformers.
   After World War II, Grundig was permitted by the Allies to
relocate his business to the city of Fuerth, where he set up his
own factory to produce radio parts.
   His company was one of the first to produce frequency modulated
radios, cutting out static interference for clearer reception.
   In 1952, Grundig was one of the first European companies to
start producing TV sets.
   During the 1960s, Grundig began setting up foreign branches.
   The company, which still bears his name, was taken over in 1984
by the Netherlands-based Philips concern and has annual sales of
more than $1.7 billion.
   Grundig is survived by his wife, Chantal.

   American opera singers Chris Merritt and
Cheryl Studer drew boos and generally negative reviews after their
performance in the opening of La Scala's season.
   Merritt, a tenor from Oklahoma City, and Studer, a soprano from
Midland, Mich., performed the main roles of Arrigo and Duchess
Elena in Giuseppe Verdi's ``I Vespri Siciliani,'' an opera set in
Sicily.
   Although they received some applause during the first part of
the opera Thursday night, they were showered with derisive whistles
and boos in the final act. The disapproval was so strong that
security guards were called to appease the crowd during one of
Merritt's solos.
   Milan newspapers reported Friday that many felt the Americans
where too ``cold'' and too ``un-Mediterranean, and unconvinced of
their role.'' The daily Il Giornale criticized Studer for a lack of
``fire and vigor,'' and said Merritt was ``unsuited for the role.''
   Verdi's work was conducted by the Italian maestro Riccardo Muti,
who was cheered by the audience throughout the five acts.
   The audience at the gala opening of the La Scala season is
notoriously hard to please.

   A new Czechoslovak-Austrian border
crossing opened Friday in another sign of the fast-moving political
changes in Czechoslovakia.
   Austria suspended its visa requirement for Czechoslovak citizens
as of Dec. 4, provisionally until Dec. 17.
   Until Wednesday, the road toward Czechoslovakia ended at the
village of Kittsee, and Czechoslovak construction teams had to
remove earth and debris for the Jarovce station on the Slovak side
to become operational.
   Barbed-wire fencing, rolls of wire and other barriers were
removed over a distance of about 1,650 feet on either side of the
road.
   A high barbed wire fence remained elsewhere, but all other
border fortifications were being dismantled, and more is likely to
come down soon.
   The new border crossing is designed to help manage the growing
influx of Czechoslovak tourists in Austria.
   The Czechoslovak state news agency CTK reported Friday that in
the first four days since Austria decided to suspend visas for
Czechoslovak citizens more than 40,000 crossed the border at the
Petrzalka-Berg checkpoint near Bratislava.
   The Jarovce-Kittsee border crossing is only about three miles
away.
   Tens of thousands also have crossed into Austria at other
checkpoints.

   Cosmonauts repositioned a module at their Mir

resupply vessel, Tass said Friday.
   The 40-ton Kvant 2 space module is fitted out as a laboratory

cosmonauts to work more comfortably and safely in open space. It
also carries a shower and a sink.
   ``Once reactivated, the Kvant 2 resupply module will
considerably improve the working conditions and life of the
cosmonauts and expand possibilities for research and experiments on
board Mir,'' the official news agency said.
   The module was separated from the space station and redocked at
an airlock in maneuvers performed by engineers at the Mission
Control Center and aboard the space station by cosmonauts Alexander
S. Viktorenko and Alexander A. Serebrov, Tass said.
   Problems with a guidance system had prevented the module from
docking on Dec. 2, but the maneuver was successfully completed
Wednesday.

   The students were sent to Tokyo about 17 hours after arriving at
Seoul's Kimpo International Airport on Thursday with fake Argentine

   The students staged a hunger strike overnight at the airport
after South Korean immigration officials asked them to leave or go
back to Tokyo where they had been studying, airport officials said.
   The students said they were going to Canada to seek refuge
because they feared punishment for having staged anti-government
protests in Japan against the brutal suppression of the
pro-democracy movement in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in June.
   The Chinese claimed they had tried to go to Canada via South
Korea with the help of a Taiwanese travel agent.

<BYLINE>By PAUL SHIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union and South Korea
established a consular relationship Friday in a first step toward
formal diplomatic ties.
   Foreign Minister Choi Ho-joong said the consular ties, although
limited, would help the two former adversaries to strengthen
relations in economic and other fields.
   After a series of consulations in Moscow and Singapore, the two
countries agreed to establish ``consular departments'' in their
semi-official trade offices opened this year, a ministry statement
said.
   The ``consular departments'' will operate as part of the trade
offices but will be staffed by officials from the two coutnries'
foreign ministries, the statement said.
   Vice Foreign Minister Hong Soon-young said Seoul had to agree on
the new form of consular ties because of Moscow's close alliance
with North Korea, which is South Korea's bitter adversary.
   ``Most of all, the announcement reflects a rapid change in
progress in economic and other fields between the two countries
and, in the long run, it shows that the chances of formal ties are
not remote,'' Hong said.
   He said Seoul's improved relations with the Soviet Union would
positively affect South Korea's efforts to establish formal
relations with China and other socialist countries.
   Valeriy Nazarov, chief of the Soviet Trade Office in Seoul,
welcomed the decision, saying, ``It is a result of growing ties
between the two countries in the fields of trade, sports and
culture.''
   He said, however, that the two countries would not establish
formal ties in the near future.'
   Nazarov said the Soviet Union has to honor its friendly
relations with North Korea. The Soviet Union backed North Korea
during the 1950-53 Korean War and continues to supply arms to the
Pyongyang government.
   Since World War II, Seoul has regarded the Soviet Union as an
enemy country.
   There have been many recent non-political contacts between the
two countries. The Soviet Union attended the 1988 Seoul Olympics,
and the two swapped trade offices this year.
   South Korea also has improved relations with other socialist
countries: Hungary and Poland formally recognized South Korea this
year; Yugoslavia is expected to do so later this month; and
Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria have exchanged trade offices with Seoul.
   Trade between South Korea and the Soviet Union reached $432
million in the first 10 months of this year, up 156 percent from
the corresponding period last year.
   Korean exports to the Soviet Union quardrupled from $25 million
to $101 million during the 10-month period. Korea's imports from
the Soviet Union in the same period rose from $144 million to $331
million.
   South Korea's major exports include textiles, electronic
appliances, steel and ships. It imports coal, timber, fish and
agricultural products from the Soviet Union.

   Snowstorms today stretched from Kansas to the nation's capital,
closing schools and paralyzing rush hour traffic, while ski resort
workers in West Virginia danced in anticipation of busy slopes.
   Heavy snow in Arkansas, Missouri and Oklahoma made roads
treacherous, and police said at least 10 people were killed in
accidents Thursday and today.
   A winter storm warning was posted today for parts of Virginia,
West Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Maryland, Delaware and North
Carolina.
   Schools were closed in parts of Indiana, West Virginia and in
Washington, D.C., where snow was falling heavily and up to 8 inches
was forecast. The federal government dismissed its workers early
under a staggered-release plan in order to avoid traffic tieups.
   In West Virginia, Snowshoe Ski Area in Pocahontas got 5 inches,
Beckley, 3 inches, and Charleston, 2 inches, this morning, and up
to a foot was expected in some places by evening, the National
Weather Service said.
   ``I have my snow boots on, and I've been doing snow dances on
the counter,'' said Lisa Thompson, a clerk at a ski shop at the
WinterPlace ski resort near Beckley.
   North Carolina's first major winter storm pelted the northern
mountains early today with snow and dumped sleet and cold rain on
the rest of the state.
   In northwestern Arkansas alone, seven people were killed. The
latest victim was a pregnant woman who was killed about 7 a.m.
today on Interstate 540 at Fort Smith.
   Two 16-year-olds and a 10-year-old died in one wreck Thursday on
U.S. 71 just south of Fayetteville, state police said. The accident
occurred when the car in which they were passengers went off the
road after skidding and colliding with two trucks.
   The 16-year-old driver of the car was being treated for injuries
at a Fayetteville hospital, police said.
   Three other people died in three separate accidents in Arkansas.
   About 4 inches of snow was on the ground by early today in some
sections of the state. Warmer weather today was expected to melt
much of the snow.
   In Missouri, police said slick roads caused dozens of traffic
accidents, including one in which a couple was killed when their
car slid out of control on Missouri Route 43 in Barton County and
slammed head-on into another car.
   An 18-year-old man died when his car slid off a road and struck
a tree five miles north of Branson.
   Up to 6 inches of snow had fallen in the state by today.
   ``Troopers were just going from one accident to another,'' said
Glenn Jarvis, an inspector with the highway patrol. ``The roads are
snow-covered from here to Oklahoma.''
   Several trucks jackknifed trying to make it up a steep grade on
Interstate 44 outside Springfield, Mo., backing up traffic for one
mile.
   In southern Kansas, more than 6 inches of snow fell, while Enid,
Okla., reported 3 inches.

   An escaped prison convict has pleaded guilty
to breaking into the governor's mansion and stealing jewelry.
   John Leslie Hill, 50, admitted Thursday in Albany County Court
that he broke into the Executive Mansion on Nov. 29, 1988.
   Hill who escaped last year from a Florida prison where he was
serving time for burglary, will be sentenced Jan. 15 to six to 12
years in prison, according to a plea bargain agreement.
   Among the items taken was a gold-and-diamond Swiss watch
inscribed to Gov. Mario Cuomo, said Assistant District Attorney
Lawrence Wiest.
   Wiest said Hill apparently saw the Cathedral of the Immaculate
Conception next door and thought the governor's mansion was the
church rectory.

<HEAD>More Than 10,000 Punished in Anti-Vice Campaign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities have ``punished'' nearly 11,000
people in Beijing since October in an anti-vice campaign against
the ``six evils,'' a newspaper reported Friday.
   The Legal Daily quoted the a municipal group as saying 10,964
people had been punished and it had seized 50,000 pornographic
books, 1,630 videotapes, 1,203 gambling implements and the
equivalent of $73,000 in gambling money.
   The campaign is part of the conservative leadership's drive
against Western tendencies, and has targeted the ``six evils'' _
prostitution, gambling, drugs, pornography, superstition and the
selling of women and children.
   The report did not say how many of those ``punished'' were
arrested, but noted that 40 percent were under the age of 25
``which means the health of the youth is being seriously corroded.''
   It said prostitution, gambling and pornography were the three
most common vices in Beijing and that some managers, factory
directors and leaders ``are shielding, conniving at and sometimes
even organizing'' illegal activities.
   It cited one case of a company director caught having sexual
relations with a woman manager while watching pornographic
videotapes.
   Prostitution involving foreigners has become widespread and more
open, it said, reporting the case of one woman who carried a
``beeper'' so her customers could contact her more quickly.
   On Thursday, the Communist Party said any members involved in
prostitution would be expelled from the party.
   The Legal Daily also said gambling and the kidnapping and
selling of women and children are rampant in China's most populous
province of Sichuan.
   It said 359 people were detained for gambling in one two-day
campaign in the Sichuan city of Xichang. The campaign also netted
16 traders in women and children and rescued 10 infants.
   The provincial capital of Chengdu caught 30 prostitutes and 27
of their customers in a 15-day period in November, it said.

<HEAD>China Lodges Protest Over Student Visas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China filed a third protest Friday expressing its
``utmost indignation'' over Washington's actions to allow Chinese
students fearing persecution at home to extend their stays in the
United States.
   The protest, delivered by Vice Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu to
U.S. Embassy Charge D'Affaires Lynn Pascoe, was the third given to
the United States in the past three weeks.
   ``The U.S. action undermines the educational exchanges between
the two countries and Sino-U.S. relations as a whole, and I am
ordered to express our utmost indignation and lodge a strong
protest with the U.S. government,'' the official Xinhua News Agency
quoted Liu as saying.
   Allegations that Chinese students might be persecuted upon their
return home was ``utterly groundless,'' Liu said.
   President Bush on Nov. 30 announced a pocket veto of a
congressional bill that would permit Chinese students to change
their visa status and remain in the United States if they feared
persecution at home.
   Bush, however, said he was taking administrative steps that
would guarantee Chinese students the same rights of abode as
prescribed by Congress.
   Also on Friday, the State Education Commission said Bush's
actions violated a 1987 bilateral agreement requiring Chinese
students to return home for at least two years following the
completion of their studies in the United States.
   ``Due to U.S. violation of the Sino-U.S. agreement on
educational exchanges and its obstruction of normal student
exchanges, the State Education Commission of the People's Republic
of China has to make necessary responses, and the U.S. will be held
responsible for all the consequences arising therefrom.''
   The statement did not say whether ``necessary responses'' might
include a halt in sending students to the United States. Nearly
half of the estimated 80,000 Chinese studying abroad are in the
United States.
   On Nov. 19, China protested the congressional legislation,
eventually shelved, that would have toughened economic sanctions
imposed by the White House after the military crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrators in June.
   The next week, Pascoe was called into the Foreign Ministry to
receive a protest over the passage in Congress of the bill on
student visas.
   Relations between the two countries are at their lowest point
since the normalization of diplomatic ties in 1979. Both sides have
expressed hopes that problems can be overcome, while at the same
time insisting that the other side act first in remedying the
conflict.
   China has accused the United States of meddling in its internal
affairs by imposing sanctions and coming to the defense of Chinese
who advocate democratic reforms.
   Thousands of Chinese students in the United States and other
countries joined pro-democracy demonstrations and protested
Beijing's violent suppression of dissent.
   Australia said Friday it will allow Chinese nationals in the
country illegally, including students who have finished their
studies, to stay until at least Jan. 31, 1991.

<HEAD>Crews of Two Ships Caught on Fierce Seas</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with authorities now saying no survivors

<DATELINE>HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rescue workers found no sign today
of 39 crew members from two large container ships that disappeared
after sending out distress signals while battling a fierce storm in
the Gulf of St. Lawrence.
   A coast guard vessel, battling two-story seas and high winds,
picked up two empty life rafts and the wreckage of a third near the
area where the ships ran into trouble. It did not see either ship
or any survivors.
   ``There is wreckage,'' said Lieut. Jeff Agnew, a search and
rescue spokesman. ``Hopefully, we'll find a lifeboat yet.''
   Roy Jones, chief engineer of the Sir Wildred Grenfell coast
guard ship, said earlier that at least two bodies were seen
floating in the gulf, but Agnew said that was based on an
inaccurate report from a search plane.
   The 280-foot Johanna B, carrying a crew of 16, disappeared off
radar screens on Thursday night.
   The 23-member crew of the Capitiane Torres abandoned ship and
took to an enclosed rubber life raft before their 375-foot ship
capsized or sank.
   Winds blowing up to 80 mph hampered rescue efforts. Earlier,
Capt. Patrick Phelan of the Halifax search and rescue center had
said rescuers spotted survivors inside the raft. But that turned
out to be inaccurate, too.
   ``We're talking like 30-foot seas, heavy winds, freezing spray,
possibility of some snow,'' a rescue spokesman said. ``Visibility
is about a quarter of a mile.''
   Rescuers had lost radio contact with the Johanna B, a
Panamanian-registered vessel carrying a cargo of steel ingots. The
ship declared a mayday after reporting that it was taking in water
Thursday night about 120 miles northeast of Summerside, Prince
Edward Island, Phelan said.
   Officials were unsure where the ship was headed when it ran into
trouble.
   The 375-foot Capitiane Torres sent out the rescue call after the
ship's cargo shifted and some containers slid overboard, causing it
to list badly. It had been en route to Taiwan with general
container cargo.
   The vessel either capsized or sank, said a Coast Guard spokesman
monitoring the rescue effort in Sydney, Nova Scotia.
   The nationalities of the crews were not known.
   The Sir Wilfred Grenfell was manned by striking crewmen who
returned to work for the rescue effort. The crewmen had been on
strike a month.

<HEAD>Jobless Rate Edges Up; Manufacturing Employment Down Again</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unemployment climbed to a 10-month high of 5.4
percent in November and manufacturing payrolls shrunk for the
eighth consecutive month, the government said Friday in a report
many analysts said showed the economy was flirting with recession.
   The increase in the civilian jobless rate from 5.3 percent to
5.4 percent came despite the addition of 210,000 non-farm jobs last
month because of a big jump in the number of Americans looking for
work.
   The stock market reacted favorably to the data, taking evidence
of sluggishness as an indication the Federal Reserve would seek to
spur the economy by easing its hold on credit before the end of the
year, thus lowering interest rates.
   The 210,000 new non-farm jobs reported by the Labor Department
was in itself a moderately strong number, but the government also
sharply cut its job growth figures for October from 233,000 to
93,000.
   That brought the average month-to-month job gain for the second
half of the year to about 160,000 _ well off the average monthly
gain of 270,000 for the previous 2{ years. All of the new jobs have
been in the service side of the economy; manufacturing employment
is down 165,000 since March.
   ``What it means is the economy is weaker than we had previously
thought,'' said Elliott Platt, a senior vice president at
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp. ``We're not in a
recession yet but we're perilously close in this quarter and
probably going to be perilously close in the first quarter next
year.''
   Indeed, chief economist Allen Sinai at Boston Co. Economic
Advisers said the economy might already be in recession and at best
was ``near and certainly headed'' for one.
   They and others predicted the Fed would relax its credit policy,
but not all analysts shared that view.
   ``The economy is kind of moving along in second gear,'' said
Michael Evans, head of a Washington forecasting firm. ``It's not
very weak and it's not very strong. I don't think these numbers
suggest further easing.''
   The unemployment rate has not been 5.4 percent since January.
The increase came despite the job growth because the civilian labor
force _ those looking for work and those with jobs _ grew by
410,000 to 124.5 million, with 117.7 million of them holding jobs.
   The Labor Department said the huge revision of the October
job-growth figure stemmed from overestimating the number of
teaching and other school jobs added this fall. That revision
contributed to the reported decline in the number of local
government jobs last month.
   Elsewhere in the service sector, which has been carrying the
economy, wholesale and retail trade posted gains of 18,000 and
33,000 jobs, respectively, health services added 40,000 positions
and business services added 13,000 positions.
   Employment in business services dipped in October and many
analysts interpreted the only modest rebound in November as
evidence that demand for temporary workers, janitorial and other
services might be slipping because of the manufacturing slump.
   The department said manufacturing employment was down 27,000 in
November _ with all but 3,000 of the decline coming in the
durable-goods sector. The biggest problem area there is in
automobile manufacturing, which lost 15,000 jobs last month after
losing 10,000 in October.
   Adding to evidence of a severe manufacturing slump, the
government said the average factory work week fell from 40.8 to
40.7 hours and overtime was unchanged at an average of 3.7 hours a
week.
   Mining and construction reported modest employment gains last
month, adding 7,000 and 17,000 positions, respectively.
   The Fed has been trying to encourage economic growth without
exacerbating inflation, and Friday's report contained some
encouraging data on that front.
   Average hourly earnings were unchanged in November, and average
weekly earnings declined by 0.4 percent.
   But analysts cautioned against reading too much into the monthly
wage numbers, noting that throughout the year there has been a
sharp upswing in the first month of each quarter followed by a flat
or moderate increase the following month.
   The unemployment rates among major demographic groups were:
   _Adult white men, 4.0 percent, up from 3.8 percent in October.
   _Adult white women, 4.0 percent, unchanged.
   _White teen-agers, 11.2 percent, up from 10.4 percent.
   _All blacks, 12.1 percent, up from 11.8 percent.
   _Adult black men, 10.7 percent, up from 10.3 percent.
   _Adult black women, 10.4 percent, up from 10 percent.
   _Black teen-agers, 32.8 percent, down from 34.2 percent.
   _Hispanics, 7.8 percent, down from 7.9 percent.
   In a separate calculation of unemployment that counts members of
the armed forces stationed in the United States, the November
unemployment rate was 5.3 percent, up from 5.2 percent in October.

<HEAD>Charges Filed Against Honecker, Other Ousted Leaders</HEAD>

under way. Pickup 5th, `The meeting...</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors said today they have filed
criminal charges against former Communist Party chief Erich
Honecker and five other ousted officials accused of using their
power to rob the state and live in luxury.
   The Communist Party's official newspaper said the party must
make a new start if it is to survive the growing challenge to its
authority. It said many members favor dissolving it in favor of a
socialist movement.
   In a bid to hold onto power, the party Thursday bowed to the
opposition and agreed to rewrite the constitution and hold free
elections in May.
   The concessions preceded a crucial party congress that opened
tonight in East Berlin. Party leaders were expected to choose their
third party leader in three months and radically alter the party
structure.
   The meeting comes amid mounting civil unrest in East Germany and
political upheaval in other East bloc countries.
   In Czechoslovakia, the new premier, Marian Calfa, met with
opposition leaders today about forming a coalition government in a
bid to head off a general strike threatened Monday if
non-Communists are not given more power.
   The Soviet Union's Central Committee scheduled an extraordinary
session Saturday, and a journalist said it may discuss the growing
challenge to the Soviet party's authority _ in particular,
Lithuania's decision Thursday to revoke the Communist Party's
guaranteed monopoly on power.
   Prosecution spokesman Peter Przybylski told reporters formal
charges were filed against Honecker, former Premier Willi Stoph,
and four other ex-leaders ousted in the nationwide pro-democracy
movement.
   ``They are accused of damaging the economy of the German
Democratic Republic and of personally enriching themselves by abuse
of office and corruption,'' the spokesman told reporters.
   He said the officials' homes were searched but did not say when
the charges were filed or when a trial would occur.
   Four of the six are in prison. The 77-year-old Honecker, ousted
from power Oct. 18, is too sick to be jailed, and former Politburo
member Hermann Axen is having an eye operation in Moscow,
Przybylski said.
   In addition to Stoph, those under arrest are former Politburo
members Guenther Kleiber, Werner Krolikowski and Erich Mielke, he
said.
   Two months of political upheaval in East Germany set into motion
investigations into abuses of power by the ousted Communist elite,
whose members allegedly used their high positions to live in luxury
off the state.
   Honecker has been under house arrest in the lavish residential
compound where he and other Politburo members lived.
   In a detailed program published Thursday, the Communist Party
that ruled with orthodox communism for four decades called for ``an
alternative democratic socialism'' and admitted its role in the
current political crisis.
   It also recognized the role of the church, but it maintained the
past party line of opposing reunification with West Germany.
   Party and opposition delegations also agreed to recommend that
Parliament schedule elections May 6.
   There was speculation the party would even change its name, as
Hungarian Communists did this year.
   Neues Deutschland, the official Communist Party newspaper, said
today a ``new start'' for the party is ``indispensable, even
vital.''
   ``Not a few comrades see the solution practically in the
dissolution of the SED (Communist Party) and the new founding of a
modern socialist party movement,'' the paper said.
   The chairman of the National Democratic Party, one of several
long allied with the Communists, was quoted as proposing the top
administrator of the Berlin church district, Manfred Stolpe, for
state president.
   Parliament should elect a president after national elections,
party leader Guenther Hartmann told West Germany's Bild newspaper.
   Non-Communist Manfred Gerlach took over as interim head of state
after Egon Krenz resigned from the post this week.
   Krenz had taken over from Honecker, and although he introduced
such reforms as opening East German borders, he was forced to quit
because of his long-time association with the disgraced Honecker
government.
   On Sunday, after Krenz and his Politboro and Central Committee
stepped down, a 25-member panel of party reformers was appointed to
run party affairs until a party congress next week.
   The rapid pace of changes and public anger at former leaders
reportedly led citizens to storm secret police headquarters in four
cities and stage politically motivated strikes at several state
enterprises.
   Bild quoted Dresden Mayor Wolfgang Berghofer as saying there was
a ``potential for violence on both sides ... I understand the
motivation (for the strikes), but such a process can get out of
control.''
   U.S. military officials say some Soviet forces in East Germany
have raised their level of readiness, but apparently only to
protect their bases and nuclear weapons, according to a published
report. ``They're worried about their own forces (in the midst of
this turmoil) and rightfully so,'' The Washington Post today quoted
an unidentified senior U.S. military official as saying.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfilyev said he had no
information on the report.
   East German news media reported riots in some prisons by inmates
demanding amnesty. Since last weekend, inmates have been on hunger
and work strikes at prisons in Cottbus, Bautzen, Halle, Magdeburg
and Potsdam.

   Surgery to remove part of a liver from a man who
is donating it to his 15-month-old daughter was ``going very
smoothly'' today in the nation's second such transplant, a doctor
said.
   The operation on 20-year-old Robert Jones began at about 7.30
a.m. at the University of Chicago Medical Center and the transplant
for his daughter, Sarina, was expected to begin late in the
afternoon, said Dr. Peter Whitington, the hospital's pediatric
liver specialist.
   A team led by Dr. Christoph Broelsch performed the first such
procedure in the United States on Nov. 27 for a 21-month-old girl
from Texas who continued ``doing well'' at the hospital today,
Whitington said.
   Before the operation 11 days ago, the transplant had been done
only three times _ in Brazil, Australia and Japan, according to the
university. One child died.
   Today's procedure involving Jones, a dry-wall installer and
contractor from Millington, Tenn., near Memphis, and his daughter
was expected to last as late as midnight, Whitington said.
   No problems had arisen in the morning surgery, he said. Broelsch
was proceeding cautiously and ``taking his time.''
   ``It's going very smoothly at the moment,'' Whitington said.
   Sarina was flown to Chicago a week ago, but the surgery was
postponed because she was recovering from an infection.
   She suffers from biliary atresia, a usually fatal congenital
disorder that blocks liver bile ducts and causes a backup of bile
in the bloodstream and liver. It is the leading cause for liver
transplants involving children.
   Sarina is at a more advanced state of the disease than Alyssa
Smith, the Texas girl who last month received a transplant from her
mother, Teresa, 29.
   Mrs. Smith, a schoolteacher from Schertz, Texas, near San
Antonio, left the hospital Thursday with ``a big smile on her
face,'' hospital spokeswoman Mary Fetsch said.
   She is staying at the Ronald McDonald House, used by families
who have children in the hospital. Sarina's mother, Michelle, also
is staying at the house.
   The Medical Center hopes to perform 20 living-donor liver
transplants in the next 12 months, partly in an effort to offset
the shortage of donor organs.
   One-quarter to one-half of the youngsters who need liver
transplants are expected to die without them, because too few
organs are available from cadavers.
   Broelsch pioneered the technique of transplanting part of adult
livers into youngsters, whose abdominal cavities are too small to
accommodate whole adult organs. Partial livers grow in size as the
child grows, and the living donors regenerate the liver tissue they
have lost, doctors say.

   A bear that suffered severe electrical
burns when it toppled off a utility pole in a spectacular explosion
of sparks has been allowed outdoors with her cub for the first time
since their capture in August.
   The two will winter in an outdoor enclosure at the Rio Grande
Zoo _ out of sight of the public to minimize human contact _ after
which state game officers intend to release them back to the wild.
   The cub was first to step outside Thursday. After about 15
minutes it hustled to a cottonwood in the enclosure and began
climbing the tree.
   The mother bear has gained 80 pounds since Aug. 14, when she
fell, trailing smoke, from the 25-foot pole in an Albuquerque
neighborhood. She had been hit by two tranquilizer darts fired by
state game officers and suffered severe burns from 7,200 volts she
received when she hit a transformer on her way down, generating a
shower of sparks.
   The incident was caught by television cameras and broadcast
nationally. The bear was not considered healthy enough to go
outdoors until Thursday.
   The cub, meanwhile, has grown from 15 pounds to 80, officials
said.
   Drought was blamed for an invasion of 19 bears in the city last
August.

   President Bush still hopes to attend a drug summit
in Colombia in February, but top aides are re-evaluating the trip
plans because of continuing violence there, federal drug policy
director William Bennett said today.
   ``You have to be concerned with everybody's safety in Colombia
these days. It's really very, very rough,'' Bennett told reporters
aboard Air Force One. He was traveling with the president, who is
wrapping up a two-day, three-state trip to participate in anti-drug
rallies and to help raise funds for Republican candidates.
   Bennett said ``I haven't seen any hesitation'' on Bush's part in
terms of going to Cartagena for the summit.
   ``But you don't want to be foolhardy. You don't want to be
reckless,'' Bennett said.
   He said he was sending his chief of staff, John Walters, to
Colombia early next week to evaluate the situation. Asked why the
president wants to go to the violence-torn country, Bennett said
it's because Colombian Virgilio Barco ``wants him to come.''
   ``Barco is brave and courageous. George Bush is brave and
courageous. George Bush just admires the hell out of Barco. ...I
know that if Barco says it's important for the president to be
there, the president's going to do it unless it doesn't make
sense,'' Bennett said.
   The drug policy official added, however, ``one of the things you
have to consider is not just the security of the president but the
security of a whole lot of people who go where the president goes.''
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the summit still is
tentatively planned for Colombia in February. ``At the moment, we
think security could be provided and there are still tentative
plans to go,'' he said.
   But, Fitzwater added, ``we keep analyzing the situation.''
   Colombia has been wracked with drug-related violence, including
a truck bomb explosion this week that killed 52 people.

<HEAD>Former Black Panthers Start New Oakland Group</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Black Panther Party leaders who
were reunited at the funeral of slain party co-founder Huey P.
Newton have formed a community group to help people affected by the
Oct. 17 earthquake.
   The program announced Thursday by Bobby Seale, David Hilliard
and one-time fugitive lawyer Stephen Bingham is similar to the
Black Panthers 1960s program that sought improvements in housing,
jobs, education and health care.
   The former revolutionaries and community organizers charged the
Federal Emergency Management Agency and the American Red Cross with
doing more to assist white, upper-income neighborhoods than to help
blacks living in West Oakland, where the Cypress section of
Interstate 880 collapsed in the quake.
   They said they will work to overcome ``environmental racism,''
which they defined as a system of subjecting blacks and poor people
to health dangers and shabby living conditions near freeways and
industries.
   Seale said he plans to return from Philadelphia to his native
Oakland.
   Hilliard, a longshoreman who lives in Oakland, said residents of
West Oakland ``see the Red Cross as a double cross. They have
turned a deaf ear to the cries of the people of West Oakland.''
   Both the Red Cross and FEMA have denied similar allegations
repeatedly.
   The new group, which held a news conference to announce its
formation, said it would join several other community organizations
in calling for free medical treatment for Cypress area residents.
   They will also call for rerouting the Cypress section of I-880
away from the neighborhood, and for immediate FEMA relief and
low-cost housing for city residents left homeless by the quake.

<HEAD>Inmates Testify in Alleged Cross Burning Incident</HEAD>

   Three inmates testified that they saw county
sheriff's deputies burn a cross in a jail that housed black street
gang members.
   Daryl Ransom, Raye Simmons and Mark Harris also told a Los
Angeles County Civil Service Commission hearing Thursday that
officials failed to respond to complaints of the cross burning for
a year.
   Former deputies Brian Kazmierski and Richard Bolks are appealing
their discharges for allegedly setting fire to a makeshift cross in
a prison control booth at the Men's Central Jail sometime between
Dec. 26, 1987, and Jan. 11, 1988.
   Ransom testified that he saw Kazmierski wrap toilet paper or
tape around a cross possibly composed of mop handles, sprayed
disinfectant on the object and set it afire.
   Ransom, a murder convict who described himself as a former
member of the Crips gang, said he helped circulate a petition
signed by more than 400 gang members that reported the cross
burning. Nothing was done about the complaint for a year, he said.
   Simmons, a Crips member, said that on another occasion deputies
played loud heavy metal music over the intercom for several hours
before he saw Bolks place a small cross against a window. He
testified that Kazmierski sprayed the cross, which he thought might
have been made of toilet paper, and set it afire.
   Harris, also a Crips member, also mentioned that heavy metal
music was played before the cross burning, adding that someone
yelled racial slurs over the intercom.
   Attorney Richard Shinee, representing the two deputies, said a
cross was never burned and that the incident had been exaggerated
by gang members ``to get the deputies in trouble.''
   Sheriff Sherman Block revealed in June following an internal
investigation that there had been two cross burning incidents at
the jail.

<HEAD>Judge: U.S. Isn't Responsible for Exploding Grenade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit
brought against the U.S. government by five campers injured when a
hand grenade exploded in their campfire in the southern Utah desert.
   In a ruling released Thursday, U.S. District Judge David Sam
said the campers cannot sue the government for injuries because
they intentionally threw the weapon in their campfire.
   The campers found an M-79 grenade while hiking near Hurricane
Mesa in January 1986. The campsite was on Bureau of Land Management
property once privately leased as a munitions testing ground.
   Dennis Simons brought the weapon back to camp, and at least one
person in the group recognized it as a projectile that hadn't been
fired, according to court documents.
   The group placed the grenade by a tree, and on the evening of
Jan. 3, 1986, David Inscore threw it into their campfire, the
documents said.
   The primer detonated while the campers hid behind their
vehicles, leading them to believe the grenade had exploded. When
they gathered around the fire the weapon exploded a second time,
this time more violently, injuring all seven of the campers.
   Five of the seven sued to force the government to pay medical
expenses for injuries resulting from the blast. They were Inscore,
Simons, Penny Snow, William R. Hardman and Henry Zoetmulder.
   Simons, 38, of Salt Lake City, suffered two broken arms, chest
wounds and abdominal injuries, and permanent disabilities. Hardman,
41, of Salt Lake City, also was injured critically.
   In his ruling, Sam argued that the plaintiffs knew the grenade
was dangerous when they hid behind their vehicles after Inscore
threw it into the campfire.
   ``Clearly the act of Mr. Inscore was an intentional detonation
of the grenade,'' said the judge. ``To hold such an act a
foreseeable consequence of the United States' failure to remove the
grenade from the desert simply defies logic.''

<HEAD>Montreal Massacre Renews Debate on Weapons Restrictions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SOLL SUSSMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The easy purchase of the semi-automatic rifle
used in the massacre of 14 women has renewed debate about whether
tougher gun control laws are needed in Canada, where low crime has
been a source of national pride.
   Much of the shock at Wednesday's rampage at the University of
Montreal was simply based on the view that such things do not
happen here.
   ``It's part of a cultural tradition in Canada,'' said Gary
Mauser, a firearms control specialist and professor at Simon Fraser
University in Vancouver, British Columbia. ``Canadians are much
more law-abiding and more willing to believe that the law protects
them. The Canadians trust their police more.''
   An extensive study of attitudes in Canada and the United States
published in July by Maclean's magazine found that 3 percent of
Canadians own handguns, compared with 24 percent of Americans.
   Marc Lepine, identified by police as the man who killed himself
after Wednesday's shooting, purchased the weapon, a .223-caliber
semi-automatic assault rifle, at a hunting store Nov. 21 for $510.
   All gun purchases in Canada require a Firearms Acquisition
Certificate, which costs $8.50 and is available to anyone 16 years
or older who does not have a criminal record or a history of
violent behavior.
   The certificate is renewable every five years, and there is no
limit to the number of guns that may be purchased.
   Restricted weapons _ mostly handguns _ require an additional
registration certificate. Automatic weapons are banned in Canada.
   In the United States, the purchase of an automatic weapon
requires a special federal license, but regulations covering
semi-automatics and other weapons are at the state and local level
and vary widely.
   All buyers of firearms, however, must sign a federal form
attesting they have not been convicted of a felony, judged mentally
incompetent by a court, or dishonorably discharged from the armed
forces.
   The Canadian government has been planning changes in its gun
control law that would eliminate the import of some semi-automatic
weapons that can be easily converted to full automatic firing.
   Justice Minister Doug Lewis said Thursday in Ottawa the proposed
change would not affect weapons like the semi-automatic used
Wednesday, because they are designed for hunting and are not easily
converted to be fully automatic.
   He said that, despite the tragedy, ``There are a great many
Canadians who appreciate the rules and laws we have. We've got a
pretty law-abiding country vis-a-vis firearms control.''
   Lewis also said laws cannot guard against incidents like the
rampage at the University of Montreal. ``You can't legislate
against insanity,'' he said.
   Canadians long have considered the lesser violence on their side
of the border a keystone of national identity.
   It was a major undertone to the fervent debate that preceded
approval of the Canada-U.S. free trade agreement last year, with
opponents arguing that closer ties could bring in more aggressive
ways.
   ``My U.S. colleagues are often incredulous when they learn how
little experience their Canadian counterparts have in treating
gunshot wounds,'' Andrew Pipe, a health columnist in Toronto's
Globe and Mail newspaper, wrote recently.
   The Royal Canadian Mounted Police reported 923,125 restricted
weapons in Canada as of the end of last year, most of them handguns.
   In 1988, 158,972 certificates were issued, 1,192 applications
refused and 10,621 ``resulted in neither issuance nor refusal.''
   Gun lobbyists have consistently argued against broadening gun
control legislation.
   But Svend Robinson, an opposition New Democrat legislator,
criticized Lewis for delaying the proposed new legislation, which
has been in the works since summer.
   ``How many more tragedies of this nature must we see in this
country, before this Conservative government will finally act to
keep the commitments they made?'' he asked.

<HEAD>Architect Unveils Plans for New American Center</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 3rd graf to CORRECT spelling of Pritzker, sted Pritzger.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARILYN AUGUST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A California architect on Friday unveiled a scale
model of Paris' new American Center, saying he hoped it would be
``a party in the park.''
   ``I wanted a building which would reflect the energy of the
American Center program,'' said Frank O. Gehry of Santa Monica,
Calif. ``It's joyous, and I wanted the building to have that
feeling.''
   Gehry, born in Toronto, is one of the United States'
most-admired architects, a recent winner of the prestigious
Pritzker Prize for architecture and almost always associated with
fish designs.
   The American Center looks nothing like a fish. It is a strong
rectangular design with a pan coupe, or as Gehry put it, `` a box
with one side missing.''
   The design, imposed by the shape of the park, was a first for
Gehry. ``It was torture, and it took me three months to figure out
what to do with it,'' he said.
   Although building materials have not yet been chosen, Gehry said
he envisioned a pinkish-beige limestone for the facades. His dream,
he said, is to have sliding glass entrance doors that could be left
open during the summer.
   ``That will be my California contribution,'' he said. ``I'd like
people to be able to wander in from the park and peek around
without being intimidated.''
   The main entrance is topped by a ballet-skirt shape zinc roof
that fills the diagonal space between the other three sides of the
building, all of which are ringed with balconies.
   Groundbreaking for the $25 million center is expected to begin
in June, with completion scheduled for June 1992.
   The American Center is a non-profit educational and cultural
institution founded in 1931 to promote exchange between France and
the United States.
   In 1987, it sold its prestigious Left Bank quarters, which had
become too small to accommodate an ever-growing demand for its many
cultural offerings including language and civilization lessons,
dance, art, photography, computer and music workshops. The new
center will feature performing studios, a permanent art museum and
a 350-seat auditorium.
   The center will be built in Bercy Park in the southeastern
corner of Paris that, until recently, was a desolate stretch of
train tracks and empty warehouses.
   The ultramodern, high-tech Finance Ministry and the newly
inaugurated Opera-Bastille _ just minutes from the new American
Center and the new Bibliotheque de France across from it _ changed
all that.
   The new center is expected to handle 350,000 visitors yearly.

<TEXT>
   A U.S. doctor and lawyer say they have
notarized statements from Tibetans tesifying that they were
tortured in Chinese prisons in 1987 and 1988.
   ``The most common pattern is repeated interrogation sessions
accompanied by severe beatings and electric shock. ...,'' the
Americans wrote.
   ``Torture techniques include hanging prisoners by their wrists,
thumbs or ankles for prolonged periods, submerging prisoners in
tubs of cold water or dousing them with water,'' they said.
   The Americans' story, ``The Suppression of a People: Accounts of
Torture and Imprisonment in Tibet,'' was published earlier this
month. The authors are Dr. Blake Kerr, a resident at New York's St.
Vincent Hospital, and John Ackerly, a lawyer in Washington for the
International Campaign for Tibet.
   The authors note that the ``China Daily'' of Feb. 24 this year
carried a statement from Chinese delegates to the U.N. Commission
on Human Rights, calling allegations of torture absurd and
fabricated.
   They were in Tibet for 10 weeks in the summer and fall of 1987
and say they saw three demonstrations against Chinese rule,
witnessing the death of three demonstrators on Oct. 1. As many as
19 Tibetans were reported shortly afterwards to have been killed in
that riot.
   They also went to northern India where thousands of Tibetan
refugees live under the authority of their spiritual leader, the
Dalai Lama.
   In India they interviewed 17 Tibetans. Eight of the 17,
including five Buddhist monks, said they had been arrested, beaten
and tortured. notarized.
   One interview quoted Yoden Choedak, a 29-year-old nurse, as
saying:
   ``I cried as my clothes were being ripped off, with the help of
Chinese women police. Then I was beaten all over my body with the
electric stick, many times on my breasts, mouth and head. ...
   ``Ever since, I have had difficulty remembering things and
learning new words. I think this is from the electric sticks.''

   The United States and the Soviet Union agreed
Friday to exchange agricultural experts in the next two years.
   The agreement calls for the exchange of teams in the field of
forestry, agricultural economics, agricultural science and food
processing, according to U.S. Undersecretary of Agriculture Richard
T. Crowder.
   The protocol renews and expands an agreement signed in 1973 on
cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union in the
field of agriculture.
   Crowder, who is also negotiating a renewal of the U.S.-Soviet
long-term grain agreement, said the Malta summit between President
Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev had helped in finalizing
the agriculture agreement.
   ``The good will and spirit of cooperation established in this
historic meeting has inspired our negotiations to even greater
cooperation in the field of agriculture,'' he said.
   He said the breakthroughs at Malta underscored U.S. support for
Gorbachev's attempts to revitalize the economy of the Soviet Union,
which is suffering from widespread shortages of food, fuel and
consumer goods.
   ``President Bush has targeted the June 1990 summit for
completion of a bilateral trade agreement between the United States
and the U.S.S.R., which is a prerequisite to granting Most Favored
Nation status to the Soviet Union,'' Crowder said.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four children slain by snipers were among
10 people killed in a second day of Shiite Moslem militia battles,
including a 7-year-old shot when he switched on the light in his
bedroom, police said Friday.
   They said all the children were under age 8, and most of the
other casualties, including 20 people wounded, were civilians hit
by snipers or stray bullets in their homes.
   Hassan Hamdan, 7, was shot in the head when the light in his
bedroom shone through the rain and revealed him to a sniper in
Mossaitbeh, a low-income residential district of Moslem west Beirut
controlled by the mainstream Shiite militia Amal.
   Militiamen of Amal, which Syria supports, and the pro-Iranian
fundamentalist Hezbollah began fighting at midday Thursday. They
have battled sporadically since May 1987, in west Beirut and south
Lebanon, for supremacy among the 1.2 Shiites, Lebanon's largest
sect.
   Syrian soldiers took up positions along a deserted boulevard on
the mile-long confrontation line Friday. A police spokesman, whose
name was withheld in keeping with regulations, said the fighting
abated, ``but the militiamen remain in their positions.''
   Soon after the Syrians moved into the Bourj Abu-Haidar district,
civilians emerged from bomb shelters to inspect their damaged
apartments and gutted cars. They scurried to safety again at the
sound of sniper fire.
   Cables dangled from power poles and smoke billowed from the
wreckage of cars hit by rocket propelled grenades.
   Militiamen battled in the rain all night and most of Friday,
ignoring repeated cease-fire appeals from a security committee that
includes representatives of Lebanon's main militias.
   Schools closed for the day in west Beirut and the predominantly
Shiite southern slums, reflecting fear the confrontation would
spread to all Moslem neighborhoods.
   Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem, urged both groups to
``put an immediate end to this destructive fighting and have mercy
on the innocent civilians.''
   Fighting began in west Beirut two days after Hezbollah crushed
Amal's forces in the western sector of the Syrian-occupied Bekaa
Valley, destroying its five major bases.
   By police count, 17 people were killed in that confrontation _
16 Amal fighters and one from Hezbollah _ and 42 were wounded.
   Police say 552 people were killed and 1,532 wounded in previous
Amal-Hezbollah battles dating to May 1987.

   Vietnam authorities have arrested more

crime, Hanoi Radio has reported.
   The crackdown, which began Sunday, was carried out in 44

the objects of police searches, 558 slated for reeducation centers,
and 1,028 condemned to forced labor,'' the radio said.
   ``Nearly 200 criminal gangs have been busted and more than 500
dangerous elements detained,'' it said.
   In Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, authorities ``launched
fierce attacks on hideouts of criminals, clearing out many meeting
places of criminal elements and arresting 1,830 susppects,'' the
radio said.
   ``They have also broken up 62 gangs of professional killers and
robbers, detaining 229 of their members,'' it said.

   The infestation of Mediterranean fruit
flies in Los Angeles and Orange counties is serious and could
threaten California's agricultural economy, according to a science
panel.
   ``In summary, the panel agrees unanimously that this Medfly
problem is large, very serious and will probably increase,'' said
Roy Cunningham, a U.S. Department of Agriculture research services
official from Hilo, Hawaii.
   The panel Thursday proposed expanding the aerial spraying of the
pesticide malathion and said the need for spraying would likely
continue through April and possibly longer.
   Isi Siddiqui, assistant director of the California Department of
Food and Agriculture, endorsed the panel's recommendation and said
he expected it to be approved by the department today.
   The Medfly, which can infest more than 250 kinds of fruit and
vegetables, has been under attack in Los Angeles County since
summer. Siddiqui said spread of the Medfly could cost the farm
economy $200 million a year indefinitely.
   Rather than shrink, the infestation has spread to part of Orange
County and now encompasses some 250 square miles. The infestation
is presently confined to urban areas but could threaten
California's agricultural economy if it spread to farm country.
   Arizona authorities began stopping cars at the state line on
Thursday to prevent any fruit not certified as Medfly-free from
entering, said state entomologist Ivan Shields.
   Trucks and commercial vehicles already were subject to
inspection on entering Arizona but car inspections had been halted
in July to save about $250,000 a year. The state also has set fly
traps.
   The panel announced its recommendation at a news conference that
also drew spraying opponents who contend malathion is poisoning
people.
   The accepted method of attacking an infestation has been to
deliver a dose of malathion to the targeted area and then follow up
with the release of millions of sterile Medflies each week through
two generations of the insect's life cycle.
   However, the entire infested area would require 300 million to
400 million flies, and a government laboratory in Hawaii can only
reliably produce 100 million flies, Siddiqui said.
   The panel recommended that malathion be sprayed in each area at
least once every three weeks during the winter's coldest periods
when it takes flies longer to reach sexual maturity.
   As weather warms into spring, malathion should be applied every
two weeks and then as frequently as every seven to 10 days. Weather
conditions such as rain immediately after an application would
require re-spraying.
   During the news conference, several protesters from a fledgling
anti-malathion movement challenged the panel.
   ``Who gave the Department of Agriculture the right to poison
people?'' said one woman.
   Siddiqui responded that the department has studied the health of
people in previous spray areas and has found no ill effects from
the tiny dose of malathion spread over each acre.

   Alfred Nobel made a fortune for
inventing dynamite and earned world renown by bequeathing his
wealth to establish the Nobel Prizes. His brother, Ludvig Nobel,
built an even larger fortune from oil in czarist Russia.
   But today, the Nobel family consists of mostly middle-class
people living obscure lives in Sweden, Finland, the United States
and Canada.
   It's not quite riches-to-rags, but almost, says Carl Nobel,
Ludvig's grandson. ``We are just an ordinary, middle-class family.''
   It wasn't like that 101 years ago, when Alfred Nobel came across
his own obituary that condemned him as a warlord and profiteer from
the means of death.
   The death notice was published mistakenly when newspapers
confused the Nobel brothers at Ludvig's death in 1888, but it
prompted Alfred to rewrite his will leaving all his assets to
support the sciences and the search for peace.
   Nowadays, a few Nobel family members are invited each year to
attend the Nobel Prize ceremonies Dec. 10, the anniversary of
Alfred's death in 1896. But none has any role in choosing the
winners.
   Though the Nobel name commands respect in Swedish society
because of the prestigious prizes, the family is far reduced from
the time when it was one of the wealthiest in Europe.
   Soviet historians virtually erased Ludvig Nobel from the record
after his oil empire was seized in the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917.
   Nobel Industries, a conglomerate that evolved from Alfred's
businesses, is still a powerful force in the Swedish economy. The
inventor, who held 355 patents, built more than 80 companies in 20
nations.
   But ``no Nobel today is connected with any company named
Nobel,'' said Lorrie Holmin, a U.S.-born writer who has studied the
family.
   The only Nobel in public service is Peter Nobel, who is Sweden's
immigration ombudsman.
   Of Ludvig's 18 children, 10 survived infancy. They spawned 19
grandchildren, 67 great-grandchildren and, at last count two years
ago, 123 great-great-grandchildren.
   Carl Nobel is distinguished among them as owner of Ludvig's
101-year-old portrait, which covers an entire wall of his small
apartment in Saltsjobaden, a seafront town south of Stockholm.
   Alfred Nobel, a lifelong bachelor, had two other brothers. Emil
died at age 21 in an explosion while experimenting in Alfred's
laboratory.
   The other brother, Robert, is remembered as a black sheep,
partly because of his business failures and partly because he
contested Alfred's will. He had three children.
   As innovative as his famed brother, Ludvig designed the world's
first oil tanker, installed Europe's first oil pipelines and
invented the ``Nobel wheel,'' a wheel-and-axle modification that
could survive the bogs, quagmires and potholes of 19th-century
Russian roads, according to Stanford University's Robert W. Tolf in
his 1976 book, ``The Russian Rockefellers.''
   Ludvig began by building diesel engines, then produced munitions
and rifles and later discovered oil near the Caspian Sea.
   Before World War I, Russia supplied half the world's oil, Tolf
wrote. The Nobel family produced one-third of all Russia's crude
oil and 40 percent of its refined oil.
   Carl Nobel, a retired engineer, estimates that 99 percent of the
family's immense wealth was confiscated by the Bolsheviks after the
1917 revolution.
   A few subsidiary companies in France and Finland and part of the
tanker fleet were salvaged and financed a new diesel engine factory
in Sweden.
   ``Nobel Brothers,'' which once rivaled the Rothschilds' oil
companies in Europe, finally was dissolved in 1959 after 80 years
in business.
   The Nobel clan still meets every three years, Carl Nobel said.
Its current chairman is Sven Nobel Oleinikoff, 81, a Swiss resident.
   But in the last decades the meeting has become just a family
reunion. ``There is no business left to discuss,'' said Carl.

   The government incorrectly cut off cash
benefits to some of the most vulnerable of America's poor _ the
elderly, blind and disabled _ in more than half the cases reviewed
in a study, the Social Security Administration said Friday.
   The findings suggest more than 10,000 recipients of Supplemental
Security Income may have their benefits suspended each year
``despite being unable to act or unlikely to understand'' what they
must do to continue receiving benefits, an agency report said. It
said about 25 percent of those affected are mentally impaired to
some degree.
   ``Clearly, the agency needs to guard against this lapse in
public service,'' it said.
   SSI provides a minimum income floor to 4.5 million low-income
aged, blind and disabled people. Maximum monthly benefits are $368
for an individual and $553 for a couple this year, rising to $386
and $579, respectively, in 1990.
   Social Security's study found that the number of SSI
beneficiaries whose benefits were suspended for failure to
cooperate with the agency's efforts to monitor eligibility rose
from 80,000 in 1987 to 105,000 in 1988.
   An internal review of 1,293 suspension cases found that benefits
were incorrectly cut off in 54 percent of the cases and that the
suspensions were justified but incorrecly recorded in an additional
30 percent of the cases.
   Most of the incorrect suspensions occurred because Social
Security employees were not giving recipients adequate time and
assistance to provide financial and other information required to
demonstrate eligiblity, the report said.
   Social Security spokesman Phil Gambino said the agency was
``extremely concerned about the findings ... because they do show
we're suspending SSI payments which go to some of the most
vulnerable people, the elderly and disabled.''
   ``This can cause very serious problems for these people who are
living on very limited incomes,'' Gambino said.
   In response to the report, the Social Security Administration in
late November issued a directive to field offices cautioning that
workers ``must be careful to make sure that SSI benefits are not
improperly suspended for failure to provide information.''
   ``Failure to follow these instructions can result in serious
problems for the individuals served by the SSI program,'' the memo
said.
   Employees were reminded that recipients must be given 30 days to
respond to requests for information about their financial status,
and that an extension may be granted to those who have difficultly
providing requested information.
   In addition, the memo said, recipients who have difficulty
complying with the requests because of advanced age, disability or
homelessness should receive a follow-up contact by telephone or in
person before benefits are suspended.
   Sen. David Pryor, an Arkansas Democrat who chairs the Senate
Special Committee on Aging, said the study indicated many of those
whose benefits were cut off ``were too frail to be able to comply
with SSA's requests without the help of a field worker _ help which
never arrived.''
   ``When an SSI recipient is cut off, it can lead to homelessness,
starvation or exploitation,'' Pryor said.
   The study cited heavy workloads at the Social Security
Administration and the desire to prevent overpayments as factors in
the incorrect suspensions.
   Social Security's workforce has been slashed by 20 percent to
65,000 over the past six years as part of a campaign to modernize
and streamline operations. Workers have complained they are
overworked and unable to provide high quality service.
   SSI benefits that have been suspended are reinstated if the
recipient presents the information needed to demonstrate
eligibility. In the study group, 67 percent of beneficiaries had
been reinstated within six months of being suspended.

<HEAD>Eds: Top 5 grafs new with official confirmation; picks up 3rd graf

   Some Soviet military forces in East Germany
have raised their alert status, but it apparently is just to
protect their bases and nuclear weapons, a Pentagon official said
today.
   ``It's a self-protection measure,'' said the official, who spoke
on condition he not be identified by name.
   The official said the Pentagon does not view the Soviet move as
a prelude to intervention in the political turmoil of East Germany.
   ``They have taken increased security measures, but it is similar
to something we might do at our bases if there are problems nearby.
... They haven't moved their troops forward, and they aren't
preparing for battle,'' the official said.
   The development was first reported in today's editions of The
Washington Post.
   ``We think this is probably a benign development,'' the Post
quoted a senior U.S. military official as saying. ``They're worried
about their own forces (in the midst of this turmoil) and
rightfully so.''
   The official said, ``The Soviets are basically going into a
bastion mode.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III told the Post in an
interview that the Soviet Union has pledged to the United States
since last summer that it will not intervene militarily to block
the fast-paced changes in Eastern Europe.
   ``They have been very, very firm with us,'' Baker said. He said
the Soviets told the United States ``they would not use force in
Eastern Europe; to do so would mean that perestroika has failed.''
   Baker said the first assurances were conveyed by Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduoard Shevardnadze in a meeting in Paris last July 29,
before the entry of Solidarity into the government of Poland and
the massive flight from East Germany.
   The Soviets have used troops to suppress change in the region
before, notably in East Berlin in 1953, Hungary in 1956 and, with
their Warsaw Pact allies, in Czechoslovakia in 1968.
   There were reports last August that Romanian authorities had
requested Warsaw Pact intervention in Poland, and leaders of the
new movements in Eastern Europe have sought assurances the Warsaw
Pact would not be used against them.
   Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo., a member of the House Armed Services
Committee, said today that the reported increase in the readiness
of Soviet forces is ``a prime example of instability creating
tensions ... and tension causing a higher state of military alert.''
   Skelton stressed that the United States should maintain its
troop levels overseas and cautioned against any rash steps until
the ``turmoil and instability settles.''
   ``We just don't know what type of scenario will come to past,''
he said in a telephone interview.
   In the interview, Baker read from a cable received Thursday from
the U.S. Ambassador to East Germany, Richard C. Barkley, reporting
the ``government still runs, the people work and the economy
produces.''
   Barkley's remarks were in line with the department's comments
Thursday that it does not fear disorder in East Germany.
   ``I think what is taking place, for example, in East Germany _
daily life goes on, shops are open, things like that,'' said a
department spokesman, Richard Boucher. ``We have always held that
change should be peaceful, should be orderly. We're not trying to
create instability.''
   Boucher announced that Baker would meet with West German and
British officials during a trip to Europe starting Sunday to
``discuss issues of mutual concern.''
   Boucher said he hoped that the next government of Czechoslovakia
would be more broadly based than that headed by Ladislav Adamec
before he resigned as premier on Thursday.
   ``Any new government that is formed in Czechoslovakia must
reflect the need for broad representation, not only among factions
of the Communist Party, but in society as a whole,'' he said.
   He was asked whether the State Department regarded developments
in Eastern Europe as unstable.
   ``I wouldn't describe it that way,'' Boucher said. ``There are
dramatic events and important events happening almost every day,
and sometimes we're surprised. We welcome them. But at this point,
I don't think we're talking about instability.''

   Coastal flooding should be less severe than
expected during the next century because sea level will rise only
about 14 inches instead of 39 inches if Earth's atmosphere gets
warmer, scientists say.
   ``We have destruction along our coasts now even with modestly
rising sea level. There are going to be more and more problems, but
they won't be as bad as we thought a few years ago,'' said
glaciologist Mark Meier, director of the Institute of Arctic and
Alpine Research at the University of Colorado, Boulder.
   The revised and still-uncertain estimate of sea-level changes
was issued Thursday during the American Geophysical Union's fall
meeting by scientists who conducted nine studies on how
pollution-caused global warming will affect the oceans, glaciers
and ice sheets.
   Glaciologist Charles Bentley of the University of Wisconsin at
Madison, said his study found the sea level won't rise as much as
expected largely because the the south polar ice sheet will get
bigger, instead of melting as commonly believed.
   That is because a warmer atmosphere carries more moisture and
will dump more snow on Antarctica. The polar ice cap contains about
70 percent of Earth's water.
   A 1985 National Academy of Sciences report concluded global
warming would cause about a 39-inch rise in sea level by about the
year 2050 _ enough to allow storm surges to devastate low-lying
areas along the U.S. Gulf Coast, Florida, Bangladesh and the
Maldives, Meier said.
   But the studies led to a new consensus that the sea-level rise
will total about 14 inches, although a great deal of uncertainty
remains. That means the sea level could do anything from dropping 2
inches to rising as much as 30 inches.
   Meier and others emphasized their new forecast, which assumes a
doubling of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by 2050, may not hold
true past that year and that rising sea levels could become more
severe after that.
   Every 12-inch rise in sea level means low-lying shorelines
retreat inland by 100 feet, Meier said.
   Modest sea level increases also may destroy wetlands and let
saltwater ruin fresh water aquifers and kill plants and animals in
coastal estuaries.

<HEAD>Shoppers To Paint Murals For Soviet, African And Other Foreign Hospitals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN S. CARLSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Christmas shoppers at a mall will
get a chance next week to paint murals sending a message of love to
hospital patients in the Soviet Union and elsewhere around the
world.
   Artist John Feight, who has designed thousands of murals for
hospitals over the last 15 years, said Friday that he expects 4,000
people _ 1 percent of the shoppers expected at the Lenox Square
mall next week _ to stop and color in a section of the 116 murals
he has designed for the project.
   Sixteen of the murals _ identical pictures of the word ``love''
in Russian and English joined by a heart _ will end up in hospitals
in the Soviet Union, the 49-year-old founder of The Foundation For
Hospital Art said.
   The rest _ various pictures of butterflies, flowers and jungle
scenes _ are destined for display in hospitals in Bangladesh,
Italy, Portugal, Austria, Zaire, Liberia and Kenya, as well as
Georgia Baptist Hospital in Atlanta, Lake Charles Memorial Hospital
in Louisiana and Feight's place of birth, Joel Pomerene Memorial
Hospital in Millersburg, Ohio.
   At the mall next week, Feight and volunteers will ask passersby
to take a few minutes to help fill in the colors on the 4-by-6 foot
loose canvas murals.
   Sometimes it's not easy to get non-artists to take brush to
hand, he said.
   ``They're so innocent,'' he said. ``I go up to someone and say,
`Will you hold this please.' It's a cup of paint. And then I say,
`Now that you have this in your hand, why don't you paint this
space?' And they protest, `I can't paint. I can't draw a straight
line. I haven't taken any lessons.'
   ``But once they get into the idea that we're helping people in
hospitals, they get into it. They don't care. It's more than art.
It's love.''
   The canvasses featuring ``love'' in English and Russian were
inspired by Feight's visit in April 1988 to the Moscow Research
Institute of Eye Microsurgery. The patients there and staffers from
the U.S. Embassy helped Feight paint 37 murals on the walls of the
hospital.
   ``I did one mural that had the word `love' in Russian,'' Feight
recalled. He said that prompted the hospital's director, Dr.
Svyatoslav N. Fyodorov, to remark: ``That's what we need more of
around here, love.''
   That comment led to his latest project, Feight said.
   He said he plans to take the 16 murals to Moscow personally in
early April. From there, Fyodorov will distribute the murals to
various hospitals in the Soviet Union.
   While in Moscow, Feight said, he will direct the painting of
similar murals by Moscow residents. Those murals will be displayed
at Lenox Square in April before going to various U.S. hospitals.

   ``Cory'' returned Friday and spoke to
the people in their own language, with the simple directness that
charmed the nation in 1986 and ultimately drove a dictator into
exile.
   At a rally of more than 100,000 people, Corazon Aquino wagged
her finger and said of Vice President Salvador Laurel, who has
become her political rival: ``He's just too much. He keeps on
saying, `Cory resign, Cory resign.' What does he think I am,
stupid? That I would resign just like that so he can be president?''
   The crowd chanted:``Cory! Cory! Cory!''
   It was much like February 1986, when Mrs. Aquino, the
presidential candidate who described herself as ``just a
housewife,'' was swept into office by an outpouring of ``people
power.''
   Mrs. Aquino appears to have emerged from the ruins of a
week-long coup attempt with a new boldness, determined to confront
her foes and circumvent the advisers who have shielded her from the
people.
   She lambasted Laurel and Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, whom she fired
as defense minister in November 1986 after his followers attempted
a coup. She spoke extemporaneously in the accent and Tagalog
language of uneducated Filipinos, not the polished English of most
public addresses.
   When she told Senate President Jovito Salonga she wanted Enrile
investigated by the Senate committee examining the latest coup,
Mrs. Aquino told the crowd, Salonga replied that he had put Enrile
on the committee.
   That, she declared, caused her to pound her fist on the table
and say: ``Are we fooling each other or what? He should be the one
investigated and not the investigator!''
   Enrile agreed to remove himself from the committee, she said. To
howls of approval, she added the postscript: ``It's good that he
still has a little shame left.''
   In praising loyal military officers, she mentioned Brig. Gen.
Arturo Enrile, who negotiated the surrender of rebels Thursday in
Manila, and observed, ``Thank God he is not related to Sen.
Enrile.''
   Of Laurel she said, using his nickname: ``Before coming here, I
said to myself, `Should I even bother to mention that Doy Laurel or
should I just flick him away like a fly?'''
   After the remarks about his desire to replace her, Mrs. Aquino
said Laurel receives 24 million pesos ($1.1 million) in office
allowances as vice president.
   ``I've been thinking, if Doy Laurel really loves our country as
he says he does, maybe it's about time he resigned so we can use
that 24 million pesos,'' she told the crowd. ``Since we know that
he cannot wait to be president, I will never give up this position
to him.''
   Mrs. Aquino's style was the same one she used in 1986 to defeat
Ferdinand E. Marcos, who had ruled the archipelago for 20 years.
The crowd approved.
   ``Her remarks may be unpresidential, but the fight has really
become personal,'' said a businessman, who asked that his name not
be used.
   Celia Yutuc, an optometrist, said: ``That's what we wanted to
hear. We're happy.''

<HEAD>Grand Jury Will Look Into Handling of Sexual Abuse Reports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A grand jury will investigate whether officials
mishandled a case involving alleged sexual relations between a high
school teacher and a student, the attorney general said.
   Attorney General Doug Baily said he hoped the grand jury would
sort through the evidence and accusations, then issue a public
report.
   The grand jury is seen as a way of defusing a lawsuit filed by
the school board against police and prosecutors for a series of
raids on school buildings. The district maintains investigators
exceeded the scope of their search warrants and invaded the privacy
of students, teachers and administrators.
   Baily said Thursday he wants the grand jury to clarify the duty
of school officials in reporting sexual abuse. In addition, he
said, he wants the grand jury to consider evidence of official
misconduct by law enforcement or school officials and ``weigh if
any charges are to be filed. I'm not expecting that at this point.''
   Baily named Pat Doogan, chief assistant district attorney in
Fairbanks, to lead the grand jury. Baily said he expects the
Superior Court to grant his request for a grand jury.
   School Board President William Frick said he was glad to hear of
the grand jury, but not convinced Doogan would be independent
enough.
   ``They are all members of the state prosecutor's office. He may
be asked to pass judgment on a fellow prosecutor,'' Frick said.
   The case involves the alleged relationship between Gordon
``Satch'' Carlson and a 17-year-old girl.
   Carlson taught English for 17 years until he resigned from
Bartlett High School in August. The 44-year-old Carlson pleaded
innocent to charges of sexually abusing a minor in his care.
   The age of sexual consent in Alaska is 16, but prosecutors
insist the age is 18 in situations where the adult is in a trust
relationship with the minor.

   President Bush today predicted a `new kind of
peace'' between the Soviet Union and United States, again striking
a positive tone in the wake of skeptical comments by aides and
advisers.
   In a spech at a political luncheon here, Bush did not repeat his
more negative comments of the night before in Houston, when he said
that Soviet activities with Cuba and Nicaraga ``weigh heavily'' on
U.S.-Soviet relations.
   ``Our mission to Malta was about peace,'' the president said of
his summit last weekend with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
``Not the kind of uneasy peace we've known for the last 40 years _
hard and cold _ but about the new kind of peace we aspire to. One
that is rich with the promise of permanence.''
   ``Yes there were differences at Malta,'' he said. ``We can
express them in an agreeable and forceful way without being
disagreeable.''
   At today's fund-raiser for Rep. Hank Brown, a Colorado
Republican running for the Senate, Bush said he envisions the
coming decade ``filled with optimism, hope and a sense of new
beginnings.''
   He heralded ``new beginnings as democracy blooms behind what
used to be called the Iron Curtain.''
   His statements came following remarks by aides voicing
skepticism about Gorbachev's ability to succeed with his reforms.
   One senior official had characterized Gorbachev's economic views
as ``simplistic.'' White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater,
while disavowing that term, said it would be difficult to integrate
free-market systems into the Soviet Union because the Soviets do
not have experience or knowledge about such sophisticated economic
matters.
   Earlier in the week, Vice President Dan Quayle threw a wet
blanket on the post-summit rosiness by saying the Soviet Union was
still a totalitarian state and that Gorbachev had yet to prove he
was scaling back on international adventurism.
   But Bush today seemed anxious to again stress his hopes for ``a
new American-Soviet relationship. We took our first step toward the
next decade and the new world that is taking shape _ a new world of
security and freedom.''
   He also issued a written statement noting the massive earthquake
that devastated Soviet Armenia a year ago Thursday.
   Recalling the assistance provided by U.S. government and private
groups, and the Soviet offer of help after this year's San
Francisco-area earthquake, the president said, ``As we look to a
new era in U.S.-Soviet relations, we can take hope from these
examples of humanitarian cooperation between our two countries.''
   After the fund-raiser speech, headed to Denver's John F. Kennedy
High School for a second day of appearances to encourage
community-based anti-drug efforts.

   Bush entreated students to volunteer their own ideas on ways to
fight the drug war.
   ``You live in tough times _ in some ways much more complicated
than the world I knew when I was your age,'' he said.
   ``That is why we want your help, your thoughts. If you have an
idea to fight drugs, let's hear it. If you have a plan, share it
with yoiur community leaders, with your local officials with your
governor and your team in Washington.''

   After Denver, Bush today was off to Des Moines to appear for
Rep. Tom Tauke, a GOP contender for the seat of Democratic Sen. Tom
Harkin.
   On Thursday, at a fund-raising gala in the Houston Astrodome for
Texas' Republican senator, Phil Gramm, Bush derided the Soviet
Union for its relations with Cuba and Nicaragua.
   ``Whatever the Sandinistas have told the Soviet Union, we know
for fact certain that arms are going from Nicaragua into El
Salvador,'' he said, referring to the Soviets' contention that
Moscow no longer arms Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government or
the Marxist rebels in El Salvador.
   Earlier Thursday, he visited Winzer Park in a once-drug infested
part of Houston.
   He said Americans should assume the task of ridding their
communities of drugs, because ``it is not a federal problem for
which there is a simple federal solution. We can't do it by looking
to the government alone.''
   ``Only the American people can make this change in attitude.
Only you can cultivate character and a sense of values in our kids.
   The park in the low-income community of Acres Homes used to be
the base of operations for some 30 drug dealers, according to
police.

   Separatist militants kidnapped the

   Police said armed members of the Kashmir Liberation Front seized

   The group demands secession of Jammu-Kashmir state from India

   Ms. Rubaiya, 22, was abducted by three men armed with AK-47
rifles as she headed home from work, according to police officials,
who spoke on condition of anonymity. They fled with Ms. Rubaiya in
a car and did not harm the other people in the van, they said.
   In a telephone call to Sayeed's Srinagar residence, members of
the group demanded freedom for five jailed militants in exchange
for Ms. Rubaiya's release.
   The five were arrested in the past year and are in custody in
various jails in Jammu-Kashmir state. None has been convicted or
charged, but they have been held under the anti-terrorism act,
which provides for detention for up to one year without charges.
   Three were identified as Hamid Sheikh, Ghulam Nabi Butt and
Sabir Shah, all believed to be top leaders of the militant
movement. The names of the other prisoners were not known.
   Sayeed, who is in New Delhi, was not available for comment. He
was named to head the home ministry on Tuesday as part of the new
government of Prime Minister V.P. Singh.
   The home minister is responsible for internal security, which
includes police, paramilitary units and domestic intelligence
agencies.
   Jammu-Kashmir is India's only Moslem majority state. Militants
have been agitating for secession from India, claiming Moslems are
discriminated against by the majority Hindus.
   Moslems form 11 percent of India's 880 million people and Hindus
make up 80 percent.
   Sayeed is a Moslem, and his appointment as home minister was
seen as an attempt to answer the allegations of discrimination.
   Jammu-Kashmir state is claimed by both Hindu-majority India and
Moslem-dominated Pakistan. The two countries have fought three wars
over the territory since they gained independence from Britain in
1947.

<HEAD>Drug Traffickers Laundering 2 Billion Dollars In Britain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain is regarded in the United States and
Canada as ``an offshore banking system'' because drug traffickers
have laundered at least $1.9 billion in the country, a
parliamentary committee says.
   The House of Commons Home Affairs Committee said in a report
published Thursday that this amount could pose ``a significant
threat to the well-being of Britain's financial institutions.''
   Home Office Minister David Mellor told the Commons on Friday
that international drug traffickers are trying harder than ever to
bring drugs into the country.
   The committee said the drug laundering could have a particularly
destabilizing effect on smaller financial institutions whose
deposits were cut by successful detection and confiscation of drug
profits.
   The report said urgent reforms were needed to increase the
effectiveness of the 1986 Drug Trafficking Offenses Act, which was
introduced to combat international drug trafficking through the
seizure and confiscation of the proceeds.
   Between January 1987 and May 1989, it said, police and customs
officials had obtained confiscation orders for only $17 million.
   Barry Price, head of the National Drugs Intelligence Unit at
Scotland Yard, said in the report that his department was handling
a case where $74 million from drug trafficking had passed to or
through Britain.
   Traffickers wanted to invest in politically and financially
stable countries, he said.
   ``It is a natural consequence of having that sort of environment
within our business world that people are going to deposit money
there,'' Price said.
   The committee urged the Bank of England to examine the scale of
the threat to the financial community posed by money laundering,
which disguises the proceeds of criminal activity.
   Mellor said that between Jan. 1 and Dec. 5, 680 pounds of heroin
was seized by customs, compared with 464 pounds for all of 1988.
   During the same period, the amount of cocaine impounded was 862
pounds, compared with 581 pounds last year, he said.
   ``This year the figures show more of an attempt being made by
international drug traffickers to bring drugs into this country
than ever before. It's an inescapable fact,'' he said.

   A man armed with a shotgun broke into a
home early today and killed his ex-wife, their two daughters and
the woman's new husband before killing himself, authorities said.
   The assailant left a suicide note to his parents saying ``he was
sorry for what he had to do,'' said Pierce County sheriff's
spokesman Curt Benson.
   The gunman smashed through a sliding glass door at the rear of
the house and shot the husband as he was calling the sheriff's
office from his bedroom to report the break-in, Benson said.
   When deputies arrived minutes later, shortly after 5 a.m., they
found the gunman's body, Benson said.
   ``We then went into the master bedroom. We found a husband and
wife on the floor. Both died of apparent gunshot wounds.''
   A 6-year-old daughter was found dead in her bedroom, and a
14-year-old daughter was gunned down in the doorway to her room, he
said. Benson identified the assailant as the woman's ex-husband and
as the girls' father.
   Authorities would not confirm the victims' identities.
   Spanaway Fire District Capt. Bruce Carpenter said all had more
than one gunshot wound, apparently from a shotgun and another gun.
   The home is in a quiet, tree-shaded neighborhood about five
miles south of Tacoma.
   Benson said the woman had divorced after a 19-year marriage and
remarried about a year ago.
   A neighbor, Michelle Silvernail, said there had been ill
feelings between the woman and her ex-husband and a custody battle
over the two girls.
   Another neighbor, Jesse James, said he was awakened around 5
a.m. when he heard five shots.
   ``It was so loud, it sounded like it was coming in my house,''
James said. ``They were having a custody fight. They had marriage
problems.''
   Deputies were interviewing the ex-husband's parents, who lived
next door.
   A neighbor, Louise Hollingsworth, said the woman feared her
ex-husband and had called police several times about him.
   Principals at the schools the girls attended said they had told
their pupils of the tragedy and brought in psychologists to counsel
the children.
   ``She was a very nice little first-grade student,'' Principal
Chuck Brock of Evergreen Elementary School said of the younger girl.
   Pat O'Brien, principal at Cedar Crest Junior High, said most of
the student body had heard of the shooting before school started at
7:30 a.m.
   ``I told them what I knew about it during morning announcements
over the intercom,'' O'Brien said. He described the older daughter
as ``a good student, very respected by her teachers and her
friends.''
   The mother was a frequent substitute teacher at the junior high,
O'Brien said.
   ``We knew there were some domestic problems a year or so ago
when there was a divorce,'' he said. ``As far as we could tell it
didn't have an effect on the daughter, and the mother could do her
work very well.''

   The air force and police are
investigating numerous UFO sightings near the border with the
Netherlands and West Germany, officials said Friday.
   Since Nov. 29, dozens of people and police officials in the
northeastern Liege province said they've seen luminous objects in
the sky, with some of them describing a flying platform scanning
the surface with three huge searchlights, while others talk of
dancing lights.
   During the same period, air traffic controllers ``found radar
blips on the screens that could not be immediately explained,''
said Defense Ministry spokesman Col. Michel Mandel.
   At the time of the sightings there were no authorized low-level
flights in the region.
   ``We are looking for a rational explanation,'' he said.
   Although Mandel cast doubts on several witness accounts, the
Belgian Society for the Study of Space Phenomena said Friday it
would send members to the German-speaking region in Liege and
across the border in the Netherlands and West Germany this weekend.
   The society said it had 150 witness accounts, in addition to
photo and videotaped material.

<HEAD>Argentine Businessman Sentenced to 7 Years in Prison</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An Argentine financier who produced the
Oscar-winning film ``The Official Story'' was sentenced Friday to
seven years in prison for his role in a $38 million bank fraud.
   Jacobo Finkielstain, 51, of Buenos Aires and New York, also was
ordered to pay back $34.7 million even though he claims he has no
assets remaining.
   Finkielstain pleaded guilty Aug. 17 to five counts of conspiracy
and bank fraud. He admitted to two schemes which defrauded the
Central National Bank of New York of $38 million.
   Finkielstain was the 99 percent owner of the federally insured
bank, which was closed and placed into receivership in September
1987.
   At sentencing, U.S. District Judge Michael M. Mukasey attached
the $34.7 million restitution as a condition to three years
probation, which will follow his seven-year prison sentence.
   Mukasey said Finkielstain must make restitution as funds become
available. The judge also imposed a $250,000 fine.
   Finkielstain admitted to fraudulently negotiating a series of
repurchase agreements valued at more than $31 million. Instead of
the normal agreements, whereby bonds are sold in return for an
understanding to buy them back at a specific time for a specific
price, Finkielstain diverted the funds into personal accounts.
   The second scheme involved more than $6 million in fraudulent
loans that Finkielstain obtained from the banks in the names of
shell corporations.
   Among Finkielstain's holdings is a movie production house that
made the 1986 film ``The Official Story,'' awarded an Oscar for
best foreign film.

   In some parts of the country, people pay
good money to get away from winter snow. Down here on the bayou,
they pay just to see it.
   The South Lafourche Chamber of Commerce is paying $4,600 to have
more than 36 tons of artificial snow brought into this southern
Louisiana town, where people have a hard time remembering the last
time it snowed.
   ``It snowed here last year,'' said Larry Weidel, the chamber's
president. ``No, three years ago.''
   Well, whatever. Anyway, Weidel said there should be enough of
the artificial stuff for three- or four-foot snowbanks. ``I would
imagine 95 percent of the people in Lafourche Parish have never
seen that type of snow,'' he said.
   He said the cChamber has hired an artificial snow company to
keep a foot and more of snow Friday night and all day Saturday on a
100-by-100-foot square in front of South Lafourche High School.
   It'll cost $1 just to get onto the school grounds, where the
snow is the centerpiece of a weekend Christmas festival. People who
want to play in the snow must pay another $1 for 15 minutes.

<HEAD>Diplomat Speaks Out on Unification, Crumbling Iron Curtain</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moscow's views on German reunification
cannot be ignored, but it would be hard to ``say no'' to a decision
made freely by the East German people, said Vernon Walters, U.S.
ambassador to Bonn.
   In an interview Thursday, the veteran of Cold War diplomacy also
showed delight about his front-row seat as the Iron Curtain's
battered remains come tumbling down.
   ``I think I'm so lucky I can't even believe it. Most of my
contemporaries are driving golf carts around Florida,'' joked
Walters, 72.
   Walters reached into a drawer of his enormous desk and pulled
out a large chunk of the Berlin Wall.
   ``I got myself a good hunk of it,'' he beamed, proudly holding
his personal remnant of the concrete barrier that once symbolized
Europe's impenetrable divisions.
   Being in the middle of the action as Europe's divisions crumble
has a special meaning for Walters, who has made a career out of
nudging it along.
   The retired Army general held crucial NATO posts in the
alliance's early years, was U.S. military attache in Paris and
Rome, served as interpreter and foreign-relations trouble-shooter
for several presidents, occupied the No. 2 post at the CIA, and has
served as U.S. ambassador-at-large and ambassador to the United
Nations.
   He has rubbed elbows with every imprtant figure from the Cold
War era _ from Dwight Eisenhower to Nikita S. Khrushchev, from
Charles de Gaulle to Marshal Tito, from John F. Kennedy to Fidel
Castro.
   And now, the barriers Walters saw going up after World War II
are being knocked down by the seemingly unstoppable democratic
euphoria sweeping Eastern Europe.
   ``The winds of freedom are blowing, and they're blowing from the
West. And anyone (Communist officials) who doesn't understand this
is going to be gone with the wind,'' Walters said.
   He was among the first U.S. officials to say German
reunification could very well occur because of the democratic
fervor toppling Communist governments across Eastern Europe.
   He said that however changes unfold in Eastern Europe, Moscow's
interests cannot be ignored.
   ``Stability is the key to the ability of the process to go on,''
Walters said. ``And I think things have to proceed in such a way
that they (the Soviets) don't feel humiliated.''
   Walters said if after free elections the East Germans decide to
``pursue a certain path, it will be very hard for people to say
no.''
   But he pointed out recent assertions by President Bush that if
unification occurs, it must come through free choice and peacefully.
   ``Peacefully means with the agreement of the Soviets,'' Walters
said. ``After all, they have 17 divisions in East Germany, and you
can't do it without their agreement.''
   The Kremlin recently softened its hard opposition to even
discussing the possibility of German reunification, and Walters
says one can't exclude the possibility of Moscow eventually
supporting the idea.
   ``I think they (the Soviets) may come to see it as being in
their own interest at some point,'' said Walters, ``especially if
we are successful in talks on reduction of conventional forces.''
   The Soviets have been worried that German reunification could
result in a major change in Europe's military balance.
   Walters also said if there were reunification, he believes the
German people would opt to stay with NATO rather than become
neutral.
   He also said he believes NATO will continue to be an
indispensible element for security in Europe.
   ``Whatever happens, there is still going to be a large, powerful
Russian state on the eastern boundaries of the European community.
And I think very few people want us to go away and leave them,''
said Walters.
   Walters has been ambassador in Bonn since earlier this year and
has been busy monitoring the historic events and keeping Washington
informed.
   ``I've met the Soviet ambassador here, and I met with the Soviet
ambassador in East Berlin. And I have the NATO ambassadors to
dinner from time to time,'' said Walters.
   Walters was in Berlin just after the wall opened and witnessed
the euphoria as East Germans streamed into the West for the first
time in their lives.
   ``I made sure I was there,'' Walters said.
   Walters said he had foreseen great changes occurring, knowing
that Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms would eventually take root in
Eastern Europe.
   ``But I'll be honest with you, the speed of the events is faster
than I had anticipated.''
   Walters said he hopes Eastern Europeans getting their first
taste of freedom don't become impatient and expect events to occur
faster than possible.
   ``We think it's moving at colossal speed, but a lot seem to
think it's moving too slowly and that some of the changes aren't
deep enough,'' he said.
   ``But I think most have enough good sense to see the long shadow
of freedom is falling across them, and the sun hasn't been out in
40 years.''

   Tests scheduled Saturday to gain entry
to U.S. universities were canceled following reports of widespread
cheating when the last exams were given in October, an education
administrator said.
   ``Someone somewhere is doing nasty and dirty things,'' Sushil K.
Liddle, director of the Institute for Psychological and Educational
Measurement, said Thursday.
   Liddle refused to give details, but a well-placed source said
copies of the October exam were sold in advance for $300 apiece to
hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Indian students who took the test.
   The institute, in Allahabad about 360 miles southeast of New
Delhi, administers the Graduate Record Examinations on behalf of
Educational Testing Service of Princeton, N.J. The test is taken
primarily by college students to enter graduate school.
   Another source, who works at the Allahabad institute, said he
was told some packets containing blank October test papers had been
opened before they arrived at testing centers in several Indian
cities. The staffer, like the first source, spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The test papers are mailed directly from Princeton to testing
centers in India, the staffer said. He said the packets were opened
after they arrived at airports and before they reached testing
centers.
   Liddle, contacted by telephone from New Delhi, said examinations
scheduled Saturday at 30 testing centers were postponed until
January.
   ``It is a very, very serious matter and we are very concerned,''
said Liddle, who has been director of the Allahabad institute since
it was founded in 1979.
   An estimated 3,500 to 4,000 students were to take the test this
month.
   The Princeton testing service invalidated the tests of
two-thirds of the Indian students who took the October exam. The
invalidations affected 2,744 people who took the tests at 17 of
India's 30 test centers.
   The Allahabad sources said the fraud was discovered when
students at some centers scored far higher than those at other
centers.
   ``That was just a doubt, but soon we heard reports that the
question papers were known beforehand at the centers where students
did extremely well,'' one of the sources said.
   Testing service spokesman Ray Nicosia said it was not known how
many students bought tests or from whom.
   Cheating is common during exams in India. Newspapers routinely
publish notices from universities to inform students their final
exams have been disqualified because of cheating.
   One of the Allahabad sources said the Institute for
Psychological and Educational Measurement learned of the October
fraud after receiving anonymous letters mailed in the south Indian
city of Hyderabad. The letters claimed some people had offered to
sell the test papers to students before they reported for the exam,
the source said.
   Some of the test takers also wrote to Princeton complaining
exams were being sold, said Nicosia.
   Liddle said two types of tests were administered in India for
students seeking admission to American graduate schools.
   Students must pay $50 for the general test. If a second test in
a specific subject is required, the fee for both tests is $85.
   Liddle said students whose tests were invalidated could get a
refund or take the test again free of charge.
   There have been reports of cheating in other tests.
   The administration of the Test of English as a Foreign Language
examination was canceled at five centers in the south Indian city
of Bangalore on Oct. 28 because of alleged fraud.

<HEAD>Investor Describes Land Swap With Lincoln; Keating Appearance Delayed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge delayed Charles H. Keating
Jr.'s scheduled court appearance today to hear testimony about a
land swap regulators claim was used to siphon funds from Keating's
savings and loan association.
   A Phoenix investor, Phillip Gordon, who also is vice chairman of
the Phoenix Planning Commission, testified that he sold a 135-acre
parcel to Lincoln Savings and Loan Association's holding company
last Jan. 28 for a price $1.5 million above its appraised value.
   The next day, Gordon said, he used the $1.5 million to make a 25
percent down payment on the purchase of 445 acres of desert land
west of Phoenix that was owned by a land development subsidiary of
Lincoln.
   Lincoln's chief government regulator had testified Wednesday
that the pair of transactions enabled Lincoln to record a phony
$4.4 million profit on its sale of the desert land.
   In turn, Lincoln's parent company siphoned off $1.8 million from
the thrift's coffers in the form of a future tax liablity on the
phony profits, the regulator told U.S. District Court Judge Stanley
Sporkin.
   Sporkin is holding hearings on government motions to dismiss a
suit Keating filed last May against federal regulators. In the
suit, Keating is asking the court to undo a decision by the
regulators last April to seize control of Lincoln as the worst of
more than 560 thrift failures since mid 1987.
   The government expects the thrift failures to cost taxpayers
more than $160 billion in covering the losses of federally-insured
deposits to a combination of poor investments, insider deals, fraud
and lax regulation. The cost to taxpayers of Lincoln's losses alone
is put at $2.5 billion.
   Keating had been scheduled to appear today but Sporkin on
Thursday told attorneys for Keating and the government that he
wanted to hear testimony today only from the regulator who
recommended the seizure of Lincoln last April and three Phoenix
businessmen.
   The regulator, Kevin O'Connell, deputy director of the Treasury
Department's Office of Thrift Supervision, testified Thursday that
Lincoln's owner used ``sham'' transactions with the three
businessmen to siphon off millions of dollars in deposits.
   O'Connell faced cross-examination today by Lincoln's attorney in
the suit, Charles Stern.
   Keating, who contributed $1.3 million to the political causes of
five senators in a campaign to thwart regulators, was the last of
eight witnesses the government has scheduled in seeking dismissal
of his suit.
   Keating and his attorneys allege Lincoln was being operated
soundly and that the government's takeover of the Irvine, Calif.,
thrift was ``capricious and arbitrary.''
   The target of a criminal investigation by a federal grand jury
in Los Angeles, Keating has refused once to testify in response to
a subpoena. Last month, he invoked Fifth Amendment protection
against self-incrimination before the House Banking Committee.
   Asked if Keating would again claim a constitutional right not to
testify in the court case in his suit, his personal attorney, John
Quinn, said Thursday, ``I'm not at liberty to discuss that.''
   O'Connell testified that Lincoln and its parent company,
American Continental Corp. of Phoenix, claimed $15.5 million in
phony profits from two bogus land transactions to justify $5.8
million in tax collections from Lincoln that were never paid the
government.
   Those two deals, involving some 1,500 acres of desert land
outside Phoenix plus a stock transaction and the tax arrangement,
are ``literally just the tip of the iceberg,'' James P. Murphy, an
attorney for the government, told Sporkin.
   O'Connell testified American Continental, of which Keating is
chairman, collected $94.8 million in deferred taxes from the thrift
from 1984 through 1988 _ much of it on phony profits from real
estate deals.
   Lincoln's attorneys say the tax-sharing arrangement under which
American Continental bundled the taxes owed by both it Lincoln were
approved by federal regulators in San Francisco.
   O'Connell, however, said Lincoln had ``misrepresented'' its
nature to the San Francisco officials. Federal regulations, he
said, allow a holding company only to act as a collector of current
taxes owed by a thrift subsidiary, not deferred taxes.
   He said Keating's tax-sharing arrangement amounted to an
interest-free loan from Lincoln to its holding company, which is
prohibited by federal law.
   Asked how much of the $94.8 million went to pay taxes, O'Connell
said, ``Our best estimate is zero.''
   The regulator said that four months before Lincoln was seized,
the government ordered American Continental to repay Lincoln $60
million of the tax payments it had collected from the thrift.
   But American Continental declared bankruptcy last April 13, one
day before the government seized Lincoln and before any of the
money was refunded, said O'Connell.
   Meanwhile, thrift regulators said Thursday that 16 S&amp;Ls were
permitted to sell $3 billion in uninsured debt to their retail
customers, the same practice that cost many depositors at Lincoln
their life savings.
   Some 22,000 investors, many of them elderly pensioners and
widows, lost an estimated $250 million by purchasing subordinated
debt in American Continental in 1987 and 1988. Despite that, the
same practice was permitted at other S&amp;Ls, including seven which
received permission for sales this year.

   Actress Beverly Todd, angered by the
misdemeanor negligent homicide conviction of the man who killed her
son, wants legislators to make the crime a felony.
   Todd held a news conference Friday to denounce the verdict
returned in the case of John Tavo Leota, who was charged with
second-degree murder in the death of her 18-year-old son, Malik
Smith, of Los Angeles.
   Smith's head hit the floor when Leota struck him at a dance club
March 18. He died two days later.
   A 3rd District Court jury Thursday found Leota, 19, guilty of
the lesser offense, a misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in
jail. He will be sentenced next month.
   ``The defendant admitted his guilt. The action of hitting Malik
_ a hit, by the way, that was powerful enough to lift our son six
inches into the air _ Malik died as a result of that hit and the
defendant got is what is tantamount to a slap on the hand, a
misdemeanor,'' said Todd, flanked by Smith's father, television
director Kris Keiser.
   Todd said she had asked state Rep. Joanne Milner to introduce a
bill that would make negligent homicide a third-degree felony,
punishable by up to five years imprisonment. Milner said she would
sponsor the bill next month.
   The incident happened at a teen disco in West Valley, where
Smith had gone while on a Utah ski vacation.
   Leota testified that Smith showed off on the dance floor and
embarrassed him. He said he did not mean to kill the man when he
hit him once and kicked him in the face.
   Todd has appeared in such movies as ``Clara's Heart,'' ``Lean On
Me,'' ``Baby Boom,'' and ``Roots.''

<TEXT>
   Every Christmas season for 15 years,
the Hernandez family adorned the pine tree on their front lawn with
garland, tinsel and more than 200 festive ornaments.
   That is until a Grinch chopped it down and made off with the
12-foot Monterey pine that had become a neighborhood landmark.
   On Wednesday, Ricardo Hernandez walked out the front door and
saw only a stump with pine needles scattered about. The 36-year-old
welder took to the trail of needles like a hunter takes to
footprints in the snow.
   The path eventually led to an apartment complex, where Hernandez
found his tree sitting on a porch.
   But the Grinch didn't live there.
   ``It was some old man with six kids,'' Hernandez said Thursday.
``He said he had bought the tree a little earlier for $7 from a
wino.''
   Hernandez didn't have the heart to take the tree back to his
distraught family.
   ``The kids were upset that somebody could steal a Christmas
tree,'' Hernandez said. ``I tried to convince them that they
couldn't steal the Christmas spirit. I tried to tell them that they
can steal a tree, but not the spirit.''
   Police say they are looking for the tree chopper.
   Neighbors who have looked forward every year to seeing the
brightly decorated tree joined in the family grief.
   ``It's awful. Especially at this time of year, and to steal that
kind of thing,'' Luis Frias said. ``Everybody around here is real
depressed.''

<HEAD>Public Approval Of Alan Cranston Slips</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Public approval of Sen. Alan Cranston has
plummeted since he and four other U.S. senators have come under
fire for intervening on behalf of collapsed Lincoln Savings,
according to a poll published Friday.
   The Los Angeles Times Poll showed that Cranston's approval
rating has undergone a turnabout since an October poll in which 56
percent of the respondents had a favorable view of him and 32
percent saw him unfavorably.
   The latest poll found 58 percent had an unfavorable impression
of Cranston, as opposed to 32 percent favorable. An overwhelming 79
percent said it was time to give someone else a chance to run for
California's senatorial seat.
   For the five-day telephone survey ending Dec. 6, calls were made
to 2,046 people, 1,594 of whom were registered voters. The poll's
margin of error is plus or minus 3 percentage points.
   Forty-one percent of those answering the poll said Cranston
should step down, as opposed to 37 percent who believe Cranston
should remain as majority whip of the U.S. Senate.
   Only 14 percent of those surveyed said Cranston has performed
his duties well enough to be re-elected.
   Cranston has come under fire for accepting $850,000 in donations
from Charles H. Keating Jr., owner of the defunct Irvine-based
thrift, and then apparently bargaining with federal regulators on
behalf of Lincoln Savings. The donations went to three voter
registration groups Cranston supported.
   A majority of those polled, 79 percent, said Cranston acted
improperly in the Lincoln controversy; only 8 percent said he acted
properly.
   Investigators believe Keating may have used contributions to
gain favor among powerful politicians to protect Lincoln Savings.
The taxpayer bailout of Lincoln Savings is expected to cost up to
$2 billion, the most expensive thrift failure in history.

<HEAD>Czechoslovakia Considered Selling Off Museum Collections</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Czechoslovakia, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Czechoslovakia has suggested selling off some of
its museum collections for hard currency, an auction house official
said Friday.
   At Czechoslovakia's invitation, three officials from Christie's
auction house visited museums and galleries in Prague and
Bratislava in September to discuss possibly selling mainly
unwanted, non-Czechoslovak items, said legal adviser David Allison.
   ``We were taken around _ nothing was offered,'' Allison said in
an interview. ``We only know that they tell us they have a lot of
stuff in their basements.''
   Allison said the proposed sale ``hasn't been dropped _ we've
left it to them to come back to us.''
   But because of the political turmoil in Czechoslovakia, ``it
won't be a very high priority. It will be some time before the
project is reviewed, if it ever is.''
   Allison said the State Jewish Museum of Prague was included in
their itinerary, prompting criticism from Jewish groups. He
insisted Christie's would not be interested in auctioning
``anything that has a doubtful title or that would raise a protest
from any section of the public.''
   The Los Angeles-based Simon Wiesenthal Center said Friday that
the Jewish museum's collection ``should remain intact and
transferred to Israel as part of the normalization of relations
hoped for as a result of current developments within Czechoslovakia
and Eastern Europe.''
   ``If the collection is sold, then monies raised clearly belong
to the Jewish community in Czechoslovakia,'' said Shimon Samuels,
the Wiesenthal center's European director.
   Allison said the Czechoslovak parliament had suggested in the
fall that state museums ``wishing to sell off unwanted items would
be allowed to do so.''
   ``Most museums have things in their basement, and all are
desperately in need of money with which to buy other items or, as
in the case of Czechoslovakia, to buy small things like
humidifiers,'' he said. ``They are very much starved of funds.
   ``The Czechoslovak government felt one way around this would be
to sell off some items'' through Christie's and ``be paid through
hard currency,'' Allison said.
   But the state agency Art Centrum, responsible for museums and
galleries, made it clear that ``items with Czechoslovak
dimensions'' would not be offered for sale to avert protests from
the country's heritage lobby.
   Prague has much European art that escaped destruction in both
world wars. Once a cosmopolitan center, it became ``very rich in
works of art from all over Europe,'' Allison said.
   He visited the National Gallery, the Museum of Technology and
the City of Prague Museum, as well as the main gallery in
Bratislava, where he said officials told him that ``only 0.5
percent of the works of art they've got is on display and the rest
is in store and in not very good condition.''
   ``Things they've got are literally rotting away'' in damp store
rooms, he said.

<HEAD>Parent Angry Over School Lunch Policy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mother of a high school student is
angry over a school policy in which cafeteria workers are told not
to feed students whose parents have outstandings bills for food.
   Joan Bowe of Campbells Creek said she learned of the policy when
her daughter came home hungry one day last month.
   ``That meant our children were in school all day long hungry and
none of us parents were made aware of it,'' Bowe said.
   Bowe's daughter and a friend had slipped out of the lunch line
after witnessing other students with outstanding bills being denied
lunch.
   ``She knew she'd be embarrassed because I hadn't sent the lunch
bill. It was just an oversight of mine,'' Bowe said.
   Unpaid bills for cafeteria meals totaled about $12,000 at DuPont
High School alone, said Principal Jimmie Compton. The debts led him
to crack down this year on students eating on credit. Parents owed
the school about $5,000 as of two weeks ago when Compton began
denying lunch to students whose lunch payments were delinquent.
   ``I can't operate a cafeteria with a deficit like that,'' he
said. ``I can't pay the bills.''
   A computerized payment system was enacted at DuPont and other
area schools last year so students who received free or reduced
lunches could not be distinguished from other students.
   Each student has a number, which a cashier punches into a
machine. Parents receive bills monthly.
   The system has worked well in most areas, although schools in
the eastern part of the county, such as DuPont, have a higher rate
of non-payment, said schools spokesman Mike Bell.
   Compton said the school informed parents who owed money that
their children would be unable to charge meals at the cafeteria if
outstndings debts were unpaid by the 15th of each month.
   Bowe said she received no notice until this week when she
received a two-month bill for about $25.

<TEXT>
   Even before they sat down for lunch, U.S. Sen.
Arlen Specter realized the possible political implications of his
Friday get-together with comedian Jackie Mason.
   ``Jackie's speaking for himself. I'll deny everything Jackie
says,'' joked Specter, R-Pa., shortly after shaking hands with
Mason before their luncheon date at Elaine's on the Upper East Side
of Manhattan.
   Mason, of course, created problems for GOP mayoral hopeful
Rudolph Giuliani earlier this year with his remarks about Jewish
voting habits and a perceived slur against blacks. While Jackie was
apologetic about the remarks at the time, he was back to his
boisterous self on Friday.
   ``Nobody claims I cost Giuliani votes. It was a fiction, a bum
rap by a couple of people at a couple of papers. ... When I joined,
Giuliani was down 20 percent. He lost by 2 percent,'' Mason said
with a shrug.
   ``It's the same jokes I told on Broadway for two years. I got a
Tony Award for those jokes,'' said Mason.
   Specter didn't appear fazed by his Mason's political past; the
pair wound up posing for dozens of pictures together with an
assortment of celebrities at the event, which was not a fund-raiser.
   Specter, who lives in the land of the cheese steak, even laughed
at Mason's Borscht Belt wisecracks.
   ``All my life I heard there was no such thing as a free lunch.
But whenever I see a senator eating, he's eating for free,'' said
Mason.
   Specter said he and Mason had met last year in Washington for
lunch _ ``I still have the receipt in my pocket,'' the senator
cracked _ and they have stayed in touch since then. Mason said the
Friday lunch was aimed at creating a higher profile for Specter,
who runs again in 1992.
   ``The truth of the matter is I love the guy,'' said Mason. ``I
want to give him all the support I can and get him re-elected.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush shared the head table at a
Republican fund-raiser Friday in Denver with Larry Mizel, a
Colorado developer whose company is one of several at the center of
federal investigations into the savings and loan industry.
   Larry Mizel, owner of MDC Holdings Inc., was chairman of a
luncheon for Rep. Hank Brown, a Republican a hoping to succeed Sen.
William Armstrong, R-Colo. Bush's speech was the main attraction at
the $250-to-$1,000-a-plate event, expected to raise between
$500,000 and $1 million.
   The president, before launching into his talk, referred to many
of the guests at the head table but did not mention Mizel, a
prominent Republican who raised $1 million for Ronald Reagan's 1984
campaign.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the president had no
say in Mizel's involvement, adding, ``He's involved here through
the Brown campaign. We just have no control over it.''
   Mizel's company, along with Lincoln Savings and Loan
Association, of Irvine, Calif., and Silverado Banking, Savings and
Loan Association, of Denver, are the focus of an investigation by
thrift regulators, according to M. Danny Wall, director of the
Office of Thrift Supervision.
   The office is looking at series transactions in which MDC,
Lincoln, Silverado and San Jacinto Savings Association, Bellaire,
Texas, swapped junk bonds and loans among themselves, Wall said.
Such ``daisy chains'' have been used by S&amp;Ls to hide questionable
credits from regulators.
   According to a September 1988 letter released by the House
Banking Committee, S&amp;L regulators in Dallas were concerned with the
``apparent unhealthy lending relationships'' among the institutions
and MDC.
   The failure of Lincoln has been the focus of lengthy hearings
this fall before the committee, which plans to examine other S&amp;L
collapses, including the December 1988 failure of Silverado.
   The Lincoln case is under scrutiny because five senators _ Alan
Cranston, D-Calif.; Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich.; Dennis
DeConcini, D-Ariz.; John Glenn, D-Ohio, and John McCain, R-Ariz. _
met with regulators on Lincoln's behalf in April 1987.
   Silverado has attracted attention because of its links to Mizel
and to Neil Bush, the president's 34-year-old son, who served on
Silverado's board from 1985 until August 1988.
   Regulators attributed the failure of Silverado to ``substantial
dissipation of assets due to alleged violations of laws, rules and
regulations.'' The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is examining the
case to determine whether to file a civil suit against Silverado's
officers and directors.
   James Moroney, a former examiner at the Federal Home Loan Bank
of Topeka, has alleged in interviews that Silverado was in trouble
as early as 1986, but regulators did not crack down because of the
institution's ties to Neil Bush and Mizel.
   Wall, on Thursday told reporters his agency looked at Moroney's
allegation and found it invalid. Neil Bush has declined to comment
on Silverado except to say he is cooperating fully with
investigations of the institution.
   Also attending the Brown luncheon was Bill Walters, another
Denver developer. Walters, who defaulted on $41 million in real
estate loans from Silverado, owned the Cherry Creek National Bank,
which extended a $1 million line of credit to Neil Bush's oil and
gas company, JNB Exploration.
   Walters was one more than 50 co-chairmen of the luncheon, who as
part of accepting the title promised to sell at least 10 $1,000
tickets to the event.

   The mother of a youthful scrooge says it
will take a miracle on any street to get her daughter to go to
school after she denounced the existence of Santa Claus.
   Kindergarten pupil Cherish Stutts doesn't believe in jolly old
St. Nicholas and she's going to stay home from school for the rest
of the year to protest her right to that belief, her mother said
Friday.
   Cherish's teacher violated the girl's rights when the teacher
took the student aside this week and asked her to keep her
skepticism about Santa Claus to herself, said Debra Stutts.
   ``I'm going to home-school her,'' the mother said. ``The
children were discovering that not everybody thinks alike. That is
a fact of life.''
   Mrs. Stutts said Cherish told other students that Santa Claus
wasn't real, the teacher overheard it and asked the girl not to say
such things.
   But Principal Graydon Axtell said the teacher talked to the girl
only after several crying classmates told her about Cherish's
opinions.
   Axtell said he stands by the teacher's actions. Parents should
decide whether their children believe in Santa Claus or not, he
said.
   ``I even believe in Santa, for crying out loud,'' Axtell said.
``Here (students) are all excited about St. Nicholas and here is a
little girl coming along and saying there is not a Santa Claus.''
   Mrs. Stutts said her daughter has never believed in Santa Claus
because she was told the ``true story of how Santa Claus came to
be. She just believes it is a story, just like Cinderella and all
the others.''
   Cherish came home hurt and confused when those beliefs were
questioned, the mother said. ``Her feelings were like, `What did I
do wrong?' What's she going to do _ go to school and sit there and
not say anything all day? I've told my children to stand up for
what they believe.''
   Mrs. Stutts said her daughter hasn't been in school since
Tuesday. ``She's a child, but her freedom of speech is just as
important.''

   The Communist Party Central Committee meets
Saturday amid rumors of Kremlin personnel changes, an impending
general strike, a growing split in the party and the first crack in
its total dominance of Soviet life.
   In Leningrad, an estimated 40,000 rank-and-file Communists
rallied this week to support President Mikhail S. Gorbachev against
what they said was a bid to oust him.
   The street meeting of Leningrad progressives was held Wednesday
night to counter a Nov. 22 rally by conservatives. Several banners
at that meeting were critical of Gorbachev and his policy of
perestroika, or reconstruction, of the nation's political and
economic system.
   One banner shown on Leningrad TV from the Nov. 22 rally read,
``We won't let you kill communism with perestroika.''
   The Communist Party is under unprecedented pressure, as
Lithuania on Thursday became the first republic in the Soviet Union
to drop a constitutional guarantee of Communist supremacy and
substitute a multiparty system within Lithuania.
   Prior to the Leningrad meeting, activists handed out leaflets
warning that Gorbachev and his closest Polituburo allies, Alexander
Yakovlev and Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, could lose their
party jobs at Saturday's Central Commmittee meeting, said activist
Gennady Bogomolov.
   He quoted the leaflet as saying, ``Everybody, come to the
meeting of protest against reactionary forces, against the attempts
to incite the convening of an extraordinary plenum of the Central
Committee to demote Gorbachev, Yakovlev and Shevardnadze.''
   Rumors of Politburo shake-ups abound before every Central
Committee meeting, since it is the only body empowered to change
its members, including Gorbachev, its general secretary. However,
Gorbachev now enjoys a measure of security, since he has
strengthened the power of the government and has been elected to a
five-year term as president.
   The official news agency Tass said the meeting will cover
measures for curing the sickly Soviet economy, the economic
five-year plan that starts in 1991 and a speech by Premier Nikolai
Ryzhkov, who handles economic matters.
   The Central Committee was expected to prepare for the next
session of the Congress of People's Deputies, the national
parliament, which convenes Tuesday.
   In Moscow, the city party committee criticized the government's
economic reforms and called on the Politburo ``not to take hasty
and insufficiently considered political decisions,'' according to
the national TV news show ``Vremya.''
   Human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov and several other
members of parliament have called for a brief general strike Monday
to call on the Congress to copy Lithuania's action on the national
level and drop Article 6 from the Soviet Constitution. The article
guarantees the Communists a ``leading and guiding role'' in Soviet
life.
   The strike call received a significant dose of publicity Friday
night when ``Vremya'' mentioned it several times, all negatively.
   On Friday, the official party newspaper Pravda responded to the
effort with defensive language.
   ``Under cover of such talk, attempts are being made to diminish
or even to devalue the party's prestige and to oust it out of
active political life,'' Pravda said in an editorial that filled
half of the front page. ``Perestroika needs the party, but a
renewed, active and strong party.''
   But Pravda also gave the clearest signal yet that the party
might be willing to see a change in Article 6.
   ``Any constitutional provision, such as Article 6, can be
subjected to re-evaluation, modernization, and even abolition,''
the editorial said. But it suggested that any constitutional
changes should be delayed to a planned complete rewrite of the
nation's basic law.
   The Baltic republic of Estonia is due to vote Dec. 15 on a
proposal to drop a similar provision from its Constitution. On
Thursday, speakers at a meeting of the Communist Party of Estonia
said they favor that change, said Harry Tiido, a commentator on
official Estonian radio.
   ``The Communist Party in the Baltic is crumbling,'' Tiido said.
``We have a de facto multiparty system.''
   The Leningrad street meeting Nov. 22 marked the emergence of
Leningrad Communist Party chief Boris Gidaspov as a leader of
conservative forces.
   At the counterdemonstration of progressives on Wednesday,
Gidaspov tried to speak but he was drowned out by shouts of
``Resign! Resign!'' according to Friday's edition of the newspaper
Komsomolskaya Pravda.
   Gidaspov was named Leningrad party chief last summer. Since the
holder of that position normally also gains a place on the national
party's ruling Politburo, the Central Committee may vote on that
issue Saturday.
   Gidaspov replaced Yuri Solovyov, who suffered an embarrassing
defeat in the parliamentary elections last spring, the first
multicandidate elections in Soviet history. As Leningrad party
chief, Gidaspov normally would be expected to be named by the
250-member Central Committee to the ruling Politburo.

<TEXT>
   A monument to Vladimir I. Lenin that has
been a rallying point for violent anti-Soviet protests should be
moved next week, local officials said Friday.
   Protesters have tried to destroy the statue during
demonstrations in the last two weeks. They have clashed with
police, who used water cannons and tear gas to disperse them.
   The Solidarity-led national government has said it won't
tolerate more violence, and mediators have called on local
officials to remove the monument so that order can be maintained.
   On Friday, the steering committee of the Krakow district council
unanimously called on the president of the panel _ in effect the
mayor _ to take steps to move the monument by Tuesday, the PAP news
agency reported. It was not clear where the statue would be moved.
   Government officials have said residents should decide the fate
of the statue to the founder of the Soviet state that dominates a
square in the Krakow suburb of Nowa Huta, built in the 1950s as a
model socialist industrial city.
   Youthful demonstrators have created a delicate problem for the
government of Prime Minister Taduesz Mazowiecki, formed of former
opposition forces who now must maintain relations with the Soviet
Union.
   The police action Nov. 29 apparently was the first large-scale
use of force against demonstrators since Solidarity took over the
government in August.
   The government said Thursday that ``hooliganism'' won't be
tolerated and the police will be forced to take ``firmer steps in
order to prevent such dangerous excesses.''
   The pro-Solidarity Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper reported Friday
that one of the participants in the disturbance, a 19-year-old
worker at the Lenin steel mill, said he and his cohorts will
continue to riot even if the statue is moved.
   Not freely elected, the people's councils that form local

central government, and they are still dominated by Communist Party
members.

   The Navy imprisoned two sailors from the USS
Fairfax County on charges they conspired to pass secret information
to a foreign agent, the Naval Investigative Service confirmed
Friday.
   The agency said that it did not believe the sailors had actually
passed along any classified information but that the case was still
under review.
   The sailors, Charles Edward Schoof, 20, and John Joseph Haeger,
19, both petty officers third class, were arrested Dec. 1 while the
ship was at Little Creek, Va., the Navy said.
   The two men, who were operations specialists with access to
classified information, were charged with conspiracy to commit
espionage, Navy officials said.
   The Navy declined to identify the foreign nation whose agent was
alleged to be involved, saying the case was still under
investigation.
   Navy officials also declined to describe the material the
sailors were accused of conspiring to disclose beyond saying it was
classified secret.
   A source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the two
sailors were assigned to duty in the ship's command information
center.
   Navy spokesman Lt. Cmdr. John Marchi said he did not know where
the two sailors were assigned aboard the Fairfax County, a landing
ship tank. But Marchi said that as operations specialists they had
access to classified information.
   One of the assigned duties of operations specialists is a ship's
command information center, Marchi said.
   Such centers contain information about ship movements and as
well as codes.
   The two sailors are in pre-trial detention awaiting court
martial by the Navy.
   Marchi said he did not have any further information about the
sailors, including their hometowns.
   The Fairfax County is a small landing ship tank used to move
troops during a sea-mounted invasion of land.

<HEAD>Man Charged With Threatening Johnny Carson</HEAD>

   A man was charged Friday with threatening
talk show host Johnny Carson, both through the mail and in person
at NBC-TV studios.
   Ken Orville Gause, 36, of Milwaukee, was charged with making
terrorist threats and sending threatening letters, both felonies
that could result in a maximum seven years in prison.
   Municipal Court arraignment was planned later in the day.
   Gause was armed with a weapon _ a weighted sock _ when he was
arrested in the NBC lobby Wednesday afternoon, about two hours
prior to the taping of ``The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.''
Authorities said he never got close to Carson.
   Carson was relieved to hear police captured Gause, police Sgt.
Don Goldberg said. Authorities said Gause had Carson's Malibu
address in his possession.
   ``This situation has been going on for two years and, coming on
the heels of Rebecca Schaeffer and Kelly Lange, we viewed this as a
serious threat to Mr. Carson,'' the sergeant said.
   Earlier this week, jurors convicted a man who threatened to kill
KNBC-TV news anchor Kelly Lange at the same NBC studio, and a
teen-ager charged with killing ``My Sister Sam'' actress Rebecca
Schaeffer was ordered to stand trial.
   Telephone calls placed to Carson's agent, Ed Hookstratten,
seeking additional comment weren't returned.
   Gause has been investigated for two years for letter and tape
recorded threats allegedly made against Carson and other
unidentified celebrities.
   ``He appears to have some emotional problems,'' Goldberg said.
   Gause apparently rode a Greyhound bus from Milwaukee to Los
Angeles, then took a taxi ride to Burbank, detectives said. He was
carrying a ``slug,'' a sock weighted with ``a heavy granular
substance,'' Goldberg said.

<HEAD>Opponents Say de Klerk in Cover-up on Death Squads</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURINDA KEYS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Church groups and political
opponents said Friday that President F.W. de Klerk was attempting a
cover-up by rejecting calls for an independent inquiry into
allegations of police death squads.
   Police also announced that de Klerk, three other Cabinet
members, Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and the Rev. Allan
Boesak, president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches, were
on a hit list found with a weapons cache after five members of a
far right-wing organization were arrested.
   ``It would seem that President de Klerk's political courage has
failed him at a crucial time on a crucial issue. ... The process
from here onwards can only be a farce,'' the South African Council
of Churches said in response to de Klerk's announcement the police
and provincial attorneys general would investigate allegations that
police hit squads had killed opponents of the white-run government.
   The Dutch Reformed Church, the largest white denomination in
South Africa, which frequently disagrees with the South African
Council of Churches on political issues, sent a letter to de Klerk
saying the need for an independent and public inquiry into police
assassination units is ``blatant.'' De Klerk is one of the few
Cabinet members who is not a member of the church.
   De Klerk, in his first substantive statement on the death squad
controversy, said Thursday night, ``A judicial inquiry can take
months, if not years, to reach its final conclusions. In the
meanwhile, a climate of suspicion and distrust could develop,
something the country can ill afford.''
   The national police force has been assailed for failing to solve
dozens of killings of government opponents since 1978.
Anti-apartheid leaders say many people believe security personnel
helped plan, take part in, or cover up such actions.
   The Council of Churches, headed by prominent anti-apartheid
clergymen such as Tutu and Boesak, said: ``It is clear the issue of
the death squads is going to be covered up.''
   It suggested that initial prosecutions could begin as the
judicial inquiry proceeded.
   ``How long did the victims of the death squads have to wait
before the South African government was forced by present
revelations to even make a pronouncement on this matter?'' the
church council said.
   Jannie Momberg, a parliamentary representative of the
anti-apartheid Democratic Party said de Klerk's decision was his
first major mistake and ``a tragic blunder,'' which would explode
in his face after the expectations raised by his enlightened
speeches about reform and change in South Africa.
   Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee said two former security
policemen whose allegations prompted the inquiry would be
prosecuted. One of them, Butana Nofemela, awaits execution for an
unrelated murder, and the other, Dirk Coetzee, is believed to have
fled abroad.
   The justice minister did not specify what charges would be
brought against Coetzee if he is extradited, but said Nofomela
would be prosecuted for the 1982 murder of Durban attorney
Griffiths Mxenge.
   Coetzee, Nofomela and a third former security policemen have
said in newspaper interviews or sworn affidavits that they took
part in death squad operations in the early and mid-1980s on orders
of superiors, many of whom still occupy high positions in the
police.
   Several police officers will be investigated, and five have been
suspended from duty until inquiries or legal proceedings are
completed, de Klerk said.
   Also Friday, Maj.-Gen. Jaap Joubert of the detective branch said
there was a plan by the right-wingers arrested Tueaday to attack de
Klerk, Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok, Defense Minister Magnus
Malan, and Foreign Minister Pik Botha to create ``chaos in the
country.''
   He said police had been monitoring the five, who had broken away
from the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance Movement. Joubert said
charges pending against the five include murder, armed robbery, and
violations of the arms and explosives acts.
   He did not specify who the group may have murdered, but a
pro-government newspaper, The Citizen, said Thursday police were
investigating the possibility that blacks had been killed as
practice for attacks on the political targets.

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of prisoners rioted in four
prisons Friday and killed at least four fellow inmates after
legislators refused to broaden a new amnesty to include repeat
offenders, state media reported.
   The worst riot, at Czarne Prison housing 1,500 hard-core
prisoners on the Baltic Coast, began Thursday evening after the
Sejm, or lower house of parliament, turned down a Senate proposal
to the amnesty approved Nov. 16.
   Disturbances also were reported in three other northern Poland
prisons, said Jerzy Rybarczyk, spokesman for the Central Board of
Penitentiaries in Warsaw.
   In all, 4,350 inmates were involved, state TV said. All the
affected facilities are maximum-security prisons.
   Justice Minister Aleksander Bentkowski, appearing on the evening
TV news, said he ordered ``extraordinary measures,'' and added, ``I
think there will be order in our prisons soon.''
   At the Czarne Prison, prisoners learned of the Sejm decision on
the TV news Thursday and immediately ``started destroying
equipment, set warehouse facilities on fire and attacked prison
guards who tried to get the situation under control,'' the state
PAP news agency said.
   Three battered and stabbed prisoners later were dumped at the
main gate of the prison by inmates, officials said. Two were dead
and the third died en route to the hospital. A fourth Czarne inmate
died later, state TV said.
   ``It is suspected that the situation was used to settle accounts
among the prisoners,'' PAP said.
   Inmates wrapped in blankets gathered on the fire-damaged prison
roof as flames shot through the windows of the brick buildings.
   ``Why are we doing it? Because we don't agree with the verdicts
that were handed out in the 1980s,'' said one prisoner, his eyes
bandaged.
   The situation inside Czarne was out of control Friday, with
about 1,000 prisoners attempting at one point to force open the
main gate, PAP said.
   Heavily armed guards and police surrounded the prison, PAP said,
quoting district prison commissioner Col. Tadeusz Judycki.
   Besides Czarne, according to TV, about 1,000 prisoners rebelled
at the Goleniow Prison near Szczecin in northwest Poland, where
inmates seized two cellblocks and set a fire. About 1,000 rioted at
Kaminsk, near Olsztyn in north-central Poland, and 850 inmates
rioted at Nowogard, also near Szczecin, TV said.
   Parliament Deputy Edward Mueller, a Solidarity representative
from Slupsk, went to Czarne Prison to try to calm the inmates, but
no formal negotiations were under way.
   The Sejm aproved a limited amnesty Nov. 16. The Polish Senate
urged broadening it to include multiple offenders, those convicted
of major thefts, and those convicted of vehicular manslaughter
under influence of alcohol.
   The proposal aroused widespread debate among Poles who feared it
would lead to a release of criminals.
   The amnesty passed Nov. 16 suspends sentences of under two years
for unpremeditated crimes and under three years for premeditated
crimes.
   Death sentences were reduced to 25 years in prison, 25-year
terms were reduced to 15 years, and other sentences were reduced by
one-third to one-half.
   The amnesty applied to crimes committed before Sept. 12, the day
the Solidarity-led government took control.

   An escalator in a subway station suddenly
stopped Friday, injuring 23 schoolchildren on an outing, a Transit
Authority spokesman said. It was the third escalator mishap this
week in the subways.
   One child had a possible broken ankle and another had a possible
broken leg, said Jim Walsh, spokesman at Bellevue Medical Center.
The other children brought to the hospital were being treated for
bumps and bruises. All were ages 9 to 11, he said.
   Sixty children were on the escalator when the accident occurred,
said Bob Previdi, a TA spokesman.
   ``We are all a little bit anxious and concerned,'' said James
Mazza, deputy superintendent of District 3 in Manhattan, which
oversees the school the students came from, P.S. 191 in Manhattan.
   Some students returned to school, where a crisis center was set
up.
   On Monday, 13 people were injured during mishaps on an escalator
about three minutes apart.
   Two people were injured during the evening rush hour when some
young people ran down a crowded up escalator in a station on
Manhattan's East Side.
   Three minutes later, the TA began to unload a train because of a
fire uptown from it. The line was more crowded than usual because
other lines were out because of a water main break.
   The platform became crowded, and transit police said people
couldn't get off the escalator and fell backward. In the ensuing
pandemonium, 11 people were injured.
   The TA is investigating its procedures to determine how the
congestion could have been avoided.

<HEAD>Beijing Mayor Says People Must Love The Army</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mayor of Beijing opened a national defense
education center Friday with an appeal for people to love the army
and a warning against the threat of anti-Communist foreigners.
   People must be educated to love and understand the People's
Liberation Army and create a better social environment for them,
hard-line Mayor Chen Xitong was quoted as saying by the official
Xinhua News Agency.
   The army is the guardian of China's socialist system, he said.
   ``The anti-government riots earlier this year showed that
foreign anti-Communist forces have never given up their plot to
subvert the proletarian dictatorship in China for even a single
day,'' he said.
   Chinese leaders and the official media have heaped praise on the
army for its role in the violent suppression of pro-democracy
demonstrators in Beijing on June 3-4.
   It has said the student-led movement was a
``counterrevolutionary rebellion'' aiming to overthrow the
government and backed by foreign agitators. The government has
never identified the alleged foreign backers, although about a
dozen people were arrested as spies for Taiwan.
   Chen said education in national defense, generally on the wane
in China since the late 1960s when Mao Tse-tung called for mass
preparations to fight what was thought to be an impending Soviet
invasion, will unite the country politically and be economically
productive.
   Such education, he said, is essential in the present domestic
and international situation.
   Despite an intense propaganda campaign, the reputation of the
army was tarnished by the June attack on Beijing in which hundreds,
and perhaps thousands, of Beijing residents were shot by soldiers.
   The Communist Party's People's Daily this week published
instructions on how local governments should praise the army so the
masses will love it.
   Military training also has been stepped up. The entire
first-year class at Beijing University, one of the centers of
student activism this spring, has been ordered to undergo a year of
schooling at a camp in a city outside Beijing.

<TEXT>
   The trial of Howard ``Pappy'' Mason neared its
conclusion Friday with prosecutors saying the accused drug kingpin
ordered the murder of a police officer to seal his position as a
drug world leader.
   ``He did something that only someone impressed with his own
power would do. He could have cared less which police officer was
killed,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Leslie Caldwell in bringing
her case to a close. ``You lose respect, you lose control.''
   Mason, 31, is on trial in U.S. District Court facing
racketeering and conspiracy charges that include ordering from his
jail cell the Feb. 26, 1988, murder of Officer Edward Byrne.
   Following instructions from U.S. District Judge Edward R.
Korman, the panel was expected to begin deliberating later Friday
afternoon.
   Four of Mason's associates were convicted earlier this year of
killing the 22-year-old rookie as he sat in his patrol car guarding
the home of a witness in a drug case in the neighborhood in the
borough of Queens where Mason's drug ring, the Bebos, operated.
   ``When Pappy Mason gave the order to kill a police officer it
was like pushing a button'' and four workers ``did it without
questioning why,'' Caldwell said.
   Mason, jailed on a state weapons charge, continued his courtroom
boycott. Court officials have hooked up a closed-circuit TV to
allow the defendant to watch the proceedings from a courthouse
holding cell.
   Mason's lawyer, Harry C. Batchelder Jr., said the government had
not come close to proving beyond a reasonable doubt that Mason had
ordered the slaying.
   Repeating his earlier arguments, Batchelder told the jury the
prosecution had produced only ``hearsay evidence'' that Mason
ordered the slaying. He said the government's witnesses _ a
collection of admitted murderers, drug addicts and thieves given
deals for their cooperation _ were absolutely incredible.
   ``When you make a pact with people like this they will sing the
French National Anthem backwards to you to save their skins,''
Batchelder said.
   In a bit of courtroom melodrama, the brawny lawyer waved before
the panel a plea agreement in which a witness had promised to tell
the truth, likening the lies he said it contained to Judas'
betrayal of Christ.
   ``This piece of paper is the equivalent of 13 pieces of silver.
This piece of paper is the guarantor of nothing,'' Batchelder said.
``It's an agreement: `If you'll dance to my tune I'll pay for it.'''
   Mason, who allegedly began dealing crack and cocaine about five
years ago in South Jamaica, Queens _ one of the city's most
notorious drug battle grounds _ went to trial 10 days ago on an
11-count federal drug conspiracy indictment. If convicted, he faces
mandatory life imprisonment.
   Most of the other members of his violent drug ring have either
been convicted or have pleaded guilty to drug charges.

   The heirs of Jack Ruby, embroiled in a
decades-long battle over ownership of the gun Ruby used to kill Lee
Harvey Oswald, now are fighting the IRS over claims to the weapon.
   A probate judge Friday gave the Internal Revenue Service until
Jan. 15 to prove its claim to proceeds from the sale of the
.38-caliber Colt Cobra that Ruby used to kill Oswald two days after
the assassination of President Kennedy.
   Ruby's brother, Earl, has until Dec. 22 to demonstrate to the
court his and other heirs' contention that they have a better claim
to profits from the estate, said Dallas County Probate Judge Robert
E. Price.
   Price plans to rule on the IRS claim by Jan. 25.
   Ruby died in 1967, four years after he shot Oswald in the
basement of the Dallas City Jail.
   At the time, Ruby owed the IRS $17,000. The back-tax bill, plus
penalties and interest, has grown to $86,010, the IRS said in court
documents. The state of Texas also is seeking $1,227 in back taxes
from the estate.
   Earl Ruby long has contested executor Jules Mayer's right to the
gun, which Mayer keeps in a safe deposit box. Earl Ruby claims his
brother, from his deathbed, told Earl that Mayer had been
instructed to tear up the will that made him executor.
   Mayer and Earl Ruby have accused each other of seeking to sell
the gun for personal gain. Mayer contends proceeds from the sale
are needed to pay off Ruby's debts.
   He has estimated the gun might bring at least $125,000 on the
historical artifacts market.
   A jury in 1964 convicted Ruby of murder and sentenced him to
death in the electric chair. But the Texas Court of Criminal
Appeals overturned the conviction, citing reasons that included
failure to move the trial from Dallas.

   While Mark Ramsey was being buried
Friday in North Carolina, investigators were trying to unravel the
bizarre sequence of events that led to his videotaped killing by a

   Ramsey, 19, a onetime bartender from Wilmington, N.C., was tied

found in early November after a young woman confessed to shooting
him to prove her credentials as an assassin, police say.
   Police said the suspect, 20-year-old Diedre Hunt, also told them
that Ramsey had been tied to a tree for the same reason _ he was
trying to prove his credentials as a hit-man to pool hall owner
Konstantinos Fotopoulos.
   Fotopoulos and Ms. Hunt were formally charged by a grand jury
Wednesday in Ramsey's death. Authorities said they were trying to
determine Friday wheter the pair were responsible for other
slayings.
   According to authorities, Ramsey and Ms. Hunt worked at one time
as bartenders in Fotopoulos' pool hall on the Daytona Beach
Boardwalk.
   Investigators say Fotopoulos hired two hit men in early November
to kill his wife, Lisa, and then allegedly shot one of them to
death in his home after his wife was wounded.
   The Ramsey slaying was unrelated to the plot to kill Mrs.
Fotopoulos, police say. But after Ms. Hunt was arrested in the
plot, authorities say, she confessed to the earlier slaying of
Ramsey.
   Police said Ms. Hunt told them that Fotopoulos had told Ramsey
that to join his ring of assassins, Ramsey had to keep from jumping
while Fotopoulos fired live bullets at his feet. Ramsey agreed to
be tied up to be sure he wouldn't jump, Ms. Hunt said. Then she
shot him.
   Ramsey's body was found, still tied to the tree, shortly after
Ms. Hunt confessed following her arrest on Nov. 8. Later, police
and prosecutors searched Fotopoulos's garage and back yard and
found an 8mm videotape of the slaying, along with the weapon
believed to have been used to shoot Ramsey.
   Assistant State Attorney David Damore, who spent four hours
explaining the case to a grand jury, said later, ``We're hoping the
seal of approval from the grand jury is the first step toward the
successful prosecution.''
   Mrs. Fotopoulos, who said she has fully recovered from a bullet
wound fired by one of her would-be assassins, said she knew Ramsey
had worked at her husband's business.
   ``He seemed like a nice boy,'' she said. ``It's a shame what
happened.''
   Fotopoulos also faces charges in his wife's shooting. Fotopoulos
told officers he had gunned down a burglar, Bryan Chase, 18, who
had broken into his home and shot his wife Nov. 4.
   When police decided that Fotopoulos had masterminded a
murder-for-hire plot, they arrested him, Ms. Hunt, Teja James, 17,
and Yvonne Henderson, 20. James told police he had tried to kill
Mrs. Fotopoulos twice but failed. Ms. Henderson told police she
knew of the plan.
   Besides the murder indictments against Fotopoulos and Ms. Hunt,
the grand jury charged all four with conspiracy to commit murder
and attempted murder and Fotopoulos, Ms. Hunt and Ms. Henderson
with soliciting to commit murder.
   All four remain in the Volusia County Jail without bail.

<HEAD>Hungarian Government Talks With Opposition To Avert Crisis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government began talks with
opposition parties and other groups Friday to negotiate a peaceful
transition to democracy and avert economic collapse, but initial
reaction from the opposition was negative.
   ``There was no agreement on anything, there are major
differences of opinion,'' said Peter Toelgyessy of the League of
Free Democrats. ``It was all right if we just view it as an
opportunity to exchange views.''
   Topics discussed were the economy; a date for general elections,
which will turn Hungary into a full-fledged parliamentary democracy
for the first time since the Communist coup in 1948, and how the
new parties can become involved in the decision-making process.
   Government spokesman Zsolt Bajnok made it clear there was no
discussion on transforming the present Cabinet into a coalition
government.
   ``The idea was not even raised,'' he said.
   Friday's talks opened a three-day series.
   Toelgyessy told reporters, ``Every time the government is in
trouble it talks about involving the opposition. In no way are we
going to assume even partial responsibility for this economic
fiasco.''
   While not thinking in coalition terms, the government was
hoping, Bajnok said, for ``political legitimation of government
decisions.''
   Bajnok told reporters the opposition parties assured Premier
Miklos Nemeth it would not exploit Hungary's difficulties for
short-term political gain and ``several promised to support the
government in its hard decisions.''
   Nemeth told them his government is not using the talks as a
device to save itself. ``The situation is much too serious for such
games,'' Bajnok quoted him as saying.
   Hard decisions that lie ahead include an austerity budget to be
submitted to Parliament this month and possible bankruptcy
proceedings against unprofitable enterprises, which will abruptly
boost unemployment.
   Major debate also centered on a general elections date.
   The governing Hungarian Socialist Party, which has disavowed the
Communist monopoly on power and even changed its name, favors Feb.
28. The big opposition parties favor March 11 or 18. Many smaller
parties want Parliament to go full term, until June. Some even
proposed early fall to give them more time to prepare.

   The Communist Party expelled more of the
old guard from its leadership Friday, leaving the ruling Politburo
with only three members who were there when Todor Zhivkov was fired
as party chief Nov. 10.
   Removed were four full and two non-voting candidate members of
the Politburo and 22 full and four candidate members of the
policy-making Central Committee. Zhivkov was among those losing
seats on the Central Committee.
   The changes were made at an unannounced meeting of the Central
Committee, which also struck from the record of the Nov. 10 meeting
a passage expressing thanks for Zhivkov's leadership.
   Zhivkov ran Bulgaria in a rigid, Stalinist fashion for 35 years
and is under investigation for corruption.
   Among those losing their jobs were Pencho Kubadinski, chairman
of the Fatherland Front; Ivan Panev, first secretary of the Sofia
party organization; Yordan Yotov, chief party ideologist, and Nacho
Papazov.
   They were purged one day after the Federation of Democratic
Forces was established to press for economic and political reform,
including free elections.
   It includes 10 independent groups that arose recently and have
called for sweeping reforms in several mass demonstrations that
would have been unthinkable under Zhivkov.
   Still on the Politburo from the Zhivkov days are Petar Mladenov,
who was foreign minister and replaced Zhivkov as party chief;
Premier Georgi Atanasov and Defense Minister Dobri Dzhurov, who is
said to have played a crucial role in Zhivkov's downfall.
   The Politburo now has eight members, compared with 10 under
Zhivkov. The Central Committee has 185 full and 145 candidate
members.
   At a meeting Nov. 16, after Mladenov had replaced Zhivkov as
party leader, the Central Committee removed three members of the
ruling Politburo in favor of more liberal Communists.
   On Friday, Alexander Lilov, 56, was made a Politburo member and
secretary of the Central Committee, as was 57-year-old Belcho
Belchev, a former finance minister.
   Lilov had been a Politburo member and party secretary in
1974-83. Official media said he was dismissed in 1983 because of
his ``criticism of the personality cult'' of Zhivkov.
   Belchev lost his job as finance minister when Zhivkov abolished
the ministry two years ago, and became Bulgarian ambassador to
Yugoslavia.
   The Federation of Democratic Forces includes the independent
Society for Human Rights, environmental group Eco-Glasnost, trade
union Podkrepa, Society for Religious Freedoms, Club of the
Prosecuted, Independent Society of Students, Civic Initiative,
Bulgarian Social Democratic Party and Nikola Petkov, a a farm group.
   A statement issued Thursday in Sofia said it wanted ``to
coordinate efforts of individual associations in order to speed up
the processes of democratization.''
   It called for a multiparty system, the rule of law and a market
economy, equality of all forms of ownership, a new labor and social
law, independent unions, a law on strikes and a democratic
constitution.
   Other demands included free elections; removing the Communist
Party from the army and militia; political rehabilitation of those
unjustly prosecuted; a free, independent press, and a new approach
to the ethnic religious minorities.
   The federation is led by a council made up of three
representatives of each member group.
   Zheliu Zhelev, chairman of the Club for Supporting Glasnost and
Perestroika, is chairman of the council, and Petar Beron, a senior
member of Eco-Glasnost, is its secretary.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of weary villagers returned
to houses shattered by a month-long mortar and artillery battle
that ended with guerrillas in control of this strategic town near
the Thai border.
   Guerrillas captured Svay Chek on Thursday morning and the people
came home in the afternoon, in a file of oxcarts loaded with
children and belongings that stretched for well over a mile down
the road.
   Villagers said more than 800 government soldiers were killed or
wounded during the long battle. The guerrillas said they lost at
least 20 fighters and had more than 50 wounded.
   The Khmer People's National Liberation Front drove the army from
the town, opening the way for an attack on nearby Sisophon, where
the Vietnam-sponsored Cambodian government has a military
operations center.
   Field commanders said the guerrillas also seized six other
nearby positions and pushed more than 10,000 soldiers back toward
Sisophon.
   ``If I had known before there were that many, I wouldn't have
attacked,'' guerrilla Gen. Khun Roeng said of the defenders.
   Retreating government troops pounded the area with artillery
fire all day Thursday. Guerrillas said 10 people were killed and 30
wounded in one village south of Svay Chek.
   It was the seventh insurgent attack on the town since late
September, when Vietnam pulled its forces out of Cambodia after
more than a decade of occupation.
   ``This is the most important victory in the 10 years we have
been fighting the Vietnamese and their puppet government,'' said
Gen. Sak Sutsakarn, the guerrilla commander for the area.
   Hours after their victory, more than 1,000 rebels moved into
trenches the government forces had dug around the town. They found
the bodies of soldiers in the trenches.
   Rebel commanders assaulted Svay Chek from three directions
Thursday. They celebrated victory with whiskey and their men fired
thousands of bursts of gunfire in the air.
   Some guerrillas searched government buildings for souvenirs.
Many wore hats, pins and scarves they said came from the bodies of
government soldiers.
   More than 1,000 weapons, mortars and artillary pieces were
captured, along with 4,000 cases of ammunition, two tanks, four
heavy trucks and an armored personnel carrier.
   Army defectors, still in uniform and armed, mingled with the
guerrillas. Wounded government soldiers were taken to medical
stations in the jungle.
   ``How many of you are left hiding in the forest?'' a guerrilla
asked one of the wounded, who replied: ``They are all gone. They
all fled.''
   Sak appealed to the world to provide food and medicine to the
more than 50,000 civilians he said are in guerrilla-controlled
areas of Cambodia.
   ``We want peace,'' he said, ``but to reach peace we have to
combine military and political action. The political action has
failed in Paris and until it succeeds, the war will continue.''
   An alliance of two non-Communist guerrilla groups and the Khmer
Rouge, a Communist fighting force that is by far the strongest, is
fighting the government of Premier Hun Sen.
   Talks on a negotiated settlement and a possible U.N. transition
role were held in Paris earlier this year, but ended without
agreement.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978 and overthrew the
brutal Khmer Rouge regime of Pol Pot, which took over the country
after the Indochina war ended in April 1975 and was blamed for more
than 1 million deaths.

<TEXT>
   Workers found seven more bodies in
rubble left from the bombing of the federal investigative police
headquarters, raising the death toll Friday to 59 from the
terrorist attack blamed on drug lords.
   Gen. Miguel Maza Marquez, commander of the investigative police,
said Pablo Escobar and Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, two chiefs of the
Medellin cocaine cartel, were responsible for the bombing that
shattered a block of buildings in downtown Bogota.
   Hospital authorities said Friday 800 people were seriously
injured in Wednesday's explosion and scores of others suffered
minor injuries.
   The death toll was expected to rise with work crews finding
other bodies under the debris and some of the critically injured
dying.
   Maza told a news conference Thursday it is believed that Escobar
and Rodriguez Gacha had contracts with Spanish terrorists to
organize Wednesday's attack and the Nov. 27 bombing of a Colombian
jetliner that killed all 107 people aboard.
   He said one Spanish terrorist, suspected of being a member of
the Basque separatist group ETA, entered Colombia recently through
the port city of Cartagena. He did not identify the suspect or say
if the man was still in Colombia.
   ETA has been waging a violent battle, including hundreds of
bombings, for about two decades to win autonomy for the Basque
provinces in northern Spain. ETA in an acronym in the Basque
language for Basque land and liberty.
   Maza said police also have identified others suspects who loaded
a bus with more than 1,100 pounds of dynamite and detonated it in
front of the police headquarters. He did not elaborate.
   Maza was in his ninth-floor office at the time of the explosion
and escaped injury, but more than 50 policemen were among the
people killed or wounded.
   The bombing was the most deadly since the government began a
campaign against the traffickers in August after the killing of a
presidential candidate was blamed on drug lords.

   President Bush on Friday announced his
intention to nominate David W. Mullins Jr., a chief architect of
the administration's bailout plan for the savings and loan
industry, to a vacancy on the Federal Reserve Board.
   Mullins, 43, a former Harvard Business School professor, was
nominated to fill a vacancy on the seven-member board created by
the resignation last summer of H. Robert Heller.
   A close associate of Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, Mullins
is currently serving as assistant treasury secretary for domestic
finance. In that post, he played a key role in representing the
administration in the lengthy congressional negotiations that
resulted in passage of the S&amp;L legislation.
   Commenting on Friday's nomination, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan said in a statement, ``I have had the pleasure of working
closely with David Mullins over the past year. He is
extraordinarily capable and will make a superb governor. I trust
the Senate will move expeditiously on his nomination.''
   Mullins was nominated for a term that will expire on Jan. 31,
1996.

<TEXT>
   Federal regulators seized New Jersey's largest
savings bank Friday after the institution recorded large losses
from real estate ventures in New Jersey, Florida and Texas.
   The government transferred control of City Federal Savings Bank
in Bedminster, N.J., to the Resolution Trust Corp., a new federal
agency created in August to dispose of failed institutions.
   ``City Federal was below all its capital requirements. It
doesn't look to us like they could recapitalize this institution
without federal assistance,'' said Bob Albanese, senior deputy
director of the federal Office of Thrift Supervision, in New York.
   ``And the institution is continuing to experience operations
losses and loan losses,'' Albanese said.
   Chief Executive Officer John Atherton, other top City Federal
officers and the thrift's board of directors were removed and
replaced by a managing agent and an oversight team, while some
managers were retained, he said.
   City Federal Savings Bank officials could not immediately be
reached for comment.
   The savings bank had $9.8 billion in assets and $7.3 billion in
858,348 deposit accounts, according to the federal Resolution Trust
Corp., which has taken control of about 280 thrifts and has
disposed of more than 30 nationwide.
   The agency will either help find a buyer for the institution or
decide to liquidate it. City Federal has 105 retail branches in New
Jersey and Florida.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision announced RTC would oversee
operations of a new federal mutual association, City Savings Bank,
which will maintain normal business hours and operations while a
permanent resolution is sought.
   ``For right now, it's business as usual,'' said Albanese.
   Word of the thrift's potential collapse had been discussed in
the industry since the institution posted third-quarter losses.
   ``It's not surprising,'' said William McCrystal, an analyst with
Ryan, Beck and Co. in West Orange, N.J. ``This is a large
institution. This is a sign of what's going to happen in the
Northeast. This says the government is going to follow through on
the legislation passed to do something about these large, troubled
thrifts.''
   McCrystal said City Federal was plagued by bad commercial real
estate and construction loans after becoming heavily involved in
real estate and mortgage banking.
   As of Sept. 30, City Federal had $747 million in non-performing
assets, which are past-due loans and loans that don't pay interest,
and only $89 million in equity compared with $326.2 million at the
end of 1988.
   ``Under normal conditions, non-performing assets are no more
than 25 percent of equity,'' McCrystal said. ``With $89 million in
equity, their losses probably would have wiped out equity had the
feds not stepped in.''
   The thrift had said last month it would be unable to meet new
capital requirements that became effective Thursday under the
thrift bailout law signed this past summer.
   Four other New Jersey thrifts already have been taken over by
federal regulators.

<TEXT>
   Czechoslovakia appeared headed
Friday toward a federal government that will put Communists in the
minority for the first time since 1948.
   For the first time, the Communists, representatives of the four
other small parties permitted in Czechoslovakia, and the opposition
held what a Communist spokesman called round table talks to discuss
the new government.
   The talks followed weeks of historic concessions by the
Communists to the nation's emboldened opposition movement, which
has filled the streets with pro-democracy protesters and threatened
a general strike Monday unless reforms are made.
   Marian Calfa, the Communist tapped to form a government after
Premier Ladislav Adamec resigned Thursday, said on national TV
Friday that ``roughly one half of the new government could be
composed of experts with no political affiliation.''
   The other half of the Cabinet seats would go to the Communists
and members of the four other political parties, government
spokesman Marcel Jansen said.
   The Communist Party ``is convinced that the most important thing
is that they are competent and professional,'' party spokesman
Josef Hora said. ``The political affiliation is only secondary.''
   Socialist Jan Skoda, who attended the meeting, said, ``It is
possible that the Communists could end up in a small minority'' in
the new government.
   In other developments:
   _The republic of Slovakia's Communist premier, Pavel Hrivnak,
and his entire 15-member Cabinet resigned or were fired, the state
news agency CTK said. Former Justice Minister Milan Cic was asked
to form a new Cabinet.
   _Hard-line Communist President Gustav Husak issued an amnesty
aimed at meeting opposition demands to release all political
prisoners. Federal prosecutor Jan Pjescak resigned.
   _Foreign Minister Jaromir Johanes asked the government to
replace 21 of the country's ambassadors.
   After the talks recessed for the day, CTK reported that Calfa
will meet on Saturday night with those who attended the opening
talks to try to have a new government sworn in by Sunday. He did
not take part in Friday's discussions.
   CTK quoted Bohuslav Kucera, chairman of the small Socialist
Party, as saying Friday's meetings helped all parties involved
``reach a great consensus'' that should enable Calfa to form a new
government.
   Jansen and opposition sources earlier Friday said the talks
would be complicated and cautioned against expecting agreement on a
new government too soon.
   The first session of talks began at 3 p.m. at Prague's Palace of
Culture, a modern structure used for concerts and large Communist
Party gatherings.
   A second round of talks lasted about 90 minutes. CTK said
opposition leader Vaclav Havel attended, as did three other former
dissidents the opposition has suggested join the government.
   Havel said ``the results will be published soon,'' but declined
to be more specific.
   Vasil Mohorita, a member of the ruling Politburo, said a
government ``representing all parts'' of the political spectrum
will be named Sunday. He did not elaborate.
   Slovak activist Jan Carnogursky said ``certain gains have been
won and it has been agreed that all the political interests will be
represented.''
   He said it was possible he would become a deputy prime minister.
   All three spoke after the meetings ended.
   A government named Dec. 3 by Adamec included only five
non-Communists in a 21-member Cabinet and left Communists in
control of all key ministries. The announcement prompted widespread
outrage and a new round of demonstrations.
   Demands mounted all week for more genuine power-sharing, with
the small People's Party, once a docile ally of the Communists but
now more outspoken, proposing the 50-50 divide between party and
non-party members.
   Besides the Communists, the People's Party and the Socialist
party are permitted in the Czech lands, and the Freedom and Renewal
parties in Slovakia.
   People's Party chief Josef Bartonicek said his party backs the
opposition candidate for first deputy premier, Carnogursky.
   Carnogursky was barred from practicing law after he signed the
Charter 77 human rights document. He was arrested in August and was
in jail awaiting trial on slander charges until his release was
granted by Husak in a first wave of concessions to the opposition
two weeks ago.
   Politburo members Mohorita and Ondrej Saling represented the
Communist Party at the talks, Hora said.
   Husak's future is expected to be discussed at the talks.
   Husak, 76, is the last of the hard-liners associated with the
1968 crackdown on reform left in power. The opposition has demanded
his resignation and appears to be pushing Havel as a possible
president.
   Husak issued an amnesty that covered prisoners jailed on a broad
range of 14 charges, including incitement, defamation of the
Socialist system and religious rulings frequently used to imprison
dissidents and religious activists.
   Husak already has released or cleared at least a dozen political
prisoners whose release was demanded by the opposition.
   The opposition had demanded Pjescak's resignation and that of
the prosecutor in the Czech region, accusing them of putting
Communist Party interests above the law and failing to investigate
police brutality against peaceful student demonstrators on Nov. 17.
   The police crackdown stirred up the mass pro-democracy movement.
   In the past three weeks, mass pro-democracy demonstrations led
by the Civic Forum opposition and its Slovak counterpart, Public
Against Violence, have forced the Communists to relinquish their
41-year monopoly on political power.
   In Washington, the State Department praised the Czechoslovak
people for showing ``courage and determination in demanding free
elections, civil liberties and rule of law.''

   A snowstorm covered the mid-Atlantic states and the nation's
capital on Thursday, entangling motorists on slush-slickened roads
and forcing officials to close schools and offices early.
   The band of snow mixed with sleet and freezing rain stretched
from Arkansas through North Carolina and Kentucky and into
Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Most accumulations were fewer than 5
inches.
   The storm was expected to linger into Saturday and could leave
up to a foot of snow across much of central Virginia, southern
Delaware and Maryland, and 8 inches in the Washington, D.C., area,
according to the National Weather Service.
   At 3 p.m. EST the snow cover near Washington included 5 inches
at Salisbury, Md., 3 inches at Baltimore and 2 inches at Andrews
Air Force Base and Washington National Airport.
   In Washington, the Office of Personnel Management told nearly
400,000 federal workers to go home early, sending waves of
employees home at 30-minute intervals throughout the afternoon.
   It was the first time the federal government has used the plan,
which is designed to help avoid traffic tie-ups.
   ``Traffic is moving more slowly because people are being
cautious, but we're not hearing of any real problems,'' Tara
Hamilton, a spokeswoman for Washington's public works department,
said during evening rush hour.
   The snow was the first of the season in Arkansas, where schools
closed Friday and utility crews worked to restore electricity to as
many as 24,000 people after ice and snow covered highways and
powerlines.
   Up to 3 inches of snow accumulated in parts of northern
Arkansas, and authorities said at least seven people died in
accidents on snow-covered highways.
   Snowfall over western Pennsylvania included 5 inches at Mount
Morris and Ohiopyle, 4 inches at Waynesburg and Marianna, and 3
inches at Somerset, Uniontown, Bedford and Johnstown.
   With up to 3 inches covering the Philadelphia area, secondary
and elementary public school students were sent home early, as were
students in Maryland and Delaware.
   In West Virginia, snowfall by midday included 4 inches at
Huntington, 3 at Charleston and 3 to 5 inches at Elkins. In
southern New Jersey, midday totals had reached 2 inches at the
Atlantic City Airport.
   Snow also extended over eastern and southern Ohio, eastern
Kentucky, western Tennessee and from northeast to south-central
Arkansas and northwest Louisiana. Snow was also scattered over
northwest Iowa.
   At noon, freezing rain extended from southeast Arkansas into
southwest Mississippi and over central Tennessee, western North
Carolina and southern Virginia.
   Heavier rainfall during the 6 hours ending at 1 p.m. EST
included 3.1 inches at Apalachicola, Fla., 2.1 inches at Savannah,
Ga., 2 inches at Ft. Stewart, Ga. and 1.6 inches at Beaufort, S.C.
   Cold temperatures moved into the northeast portion of the
nation. The low temperature for the nation Friday morning was 18
degrees below zero at Saranac Lake, N.Y.
   Reno, Nev., reached 66 degrees by midday, tying a 74-year high
temperature record for Dec. 9.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 5
degrees at Caribou, Houlton and Limestone in Maine to 83 at West
Palm Beach, Fla.

   U.S. Ambassador Michael Sotirhos asked
Friday for a six-month extension in the deadline for closing U.S.
bases in Greece.
   Constantine Mitsotakis, leader of the Conservative New Democracy
party, said Sotirhos made the request at a meeting.
   A Greek-U.S. defense agreement for four major U.S. military
bases in Greece expired in December 1988. The Americans must
dismantle the bases by May 1990 if no new pact is signed.
Negotations remain deadlocked after 17 rounds of talks.
   Talks were frozen after inconclusive general elections here on
June 18 and Nov. 5.
   Mitsotakis said Premier Xenophon Zolotas' government would look
into the U.S. request.

   An expected federal court appearance by
Arizona millionaire Charles H. Keating, whose lawsuit accuses the
government of illegally seizing his Lincoln Savings and Loan
Association, Friday was postponed until January.
   After spending the day listening to a Phoenix investor describe
details of what regulators called a land swap to siphon federally
insured deposits out of Irvine, Calif.-based Lincoln, U.S. District
Judge Stanley Sporkin recessed a hearing in the case until Jan. 2.
   Sporkin held open the possibility he might reconvene the hearing
on short notice to allow Keating's attorneys to cross-examine
federal thrift regulators if an opening occurs on his docket during
the next three weeks.
   However, attorneys for both the government and Keating said they
do not expect the beleagured Phoenix millionaire to be called as a
witness until Jan. 3 at the earliest.
   Keating filed the suit last May, a month after the Federal Home
Loan Bank Board seized control of his S&amp;L, alleging that it has
lost up to $2.5 billion in federlly insured desposits.
   Since then, the government has filed a $1.1 billion fraud and
racketeering suit of its own against Keating and a federal grand
jury in Los Angeles is weighing possible criminal charges against
him.
   A similar suit has been filed against Keating by several of an
estimated 23,000 investors who bought junk bonds in Lincoln's
parent company, American Continental Corp. The bonds were rendered
virtually worthless when the holding company filed for court
protection from creditors under the bankruptcy laws last April.
   Last month Keating invoked a Fifth Amendment privilege against
self-incrimination in refusing to testify before the House Banking
Committee about the operation of Lincoln. His attorneys declined
this week to comment on whether he would again decline to testify
before Sporkin.
   On Friday, the judge heard Phoenix businessman Phillip Gordon
describe a pair of transactions he conducted with Lincoln and
American Continental in January 1988 that enabled the thrift to
record a $4.4 million profit on the sale of 445 acres of desert
land west of Phoenix.
   Kevin O'Connell, deputy director of the Treasury Department's
Office of Thrift Supervison, had testified Thursday that the deal
was a ``sham'' because Gordon and his associates had no ability to
make the $6 million purchase.
   But as a result of the deal, O'Connell said, American
Continental, which is chaired by Keating, was able to siphon $1.8
million out of Lincoln in the form of future tax liabilities
collected on behalf of the government but never paid.
   Gordon testified that he bought the desert land from Lincoln
last Jan. 29, making a down payment of $1.5 million and financing
the other $4.5 million through a non-recourse loan from the S&amp;L.
   A day earlier, Gordon said, his Sun Olive limited partnership
had sold a 135-acre parcel it owned in west Phoenix to American
Continental for $4.2 million _ $1.5 million above the $2.7 million
that he and his partners had paid for it 13 months earlier.
   He said that he and American Continental officials had worked
out the deal in a conversation days earlier even though land values
in the Phoenix area were stagnant at the time.
   ``At some point we had discussed that the money for the down
payment would be coming from the Sun Olive sale,'' Gordon said.
   Regulators have cited the transaction as an example by which
Lincoln used land swaps and straw purchasers to record hundreds of
millions of dollars in phony real estate profits, enabling the
thrift to attract some $4 billion in new federally insured deposits
under Keating's ownership.
   Just through a tax-sharing agreement alone, American Continental
was able to siphon off $94 million of those deposits in the form of
deferred taxes never actually paid to the Internal Revenue Service,
the government alleges.
   The regulators have acknowledged they approved the tax-sharing
accord in 1986, but they claim that its nature was
``misrepresented'' to them by American Continental and Lincoln
officials.
   Under federal S&amp;L laws, they said, a thrift and its holding
company can comingle current taxes owed by each but not deferred
taxes.

<HEAD>39 Seamen Missing After Two Ships Sink</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HALIFA, Nova Scotia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Search vessels struggled through a
savage storm in the Gulf of St. Lawrence on Friday but found none
of the 39 seamen missing since two cargo ships sank in raging seas.
   Coast guard officials said the 400-foot Capitaine Torres and
270-foot Johanna B disappeared Thursday night in towering seas,
high winds and bitter cold about 120 miles apart and north of Cape
Breton.
   It said all of the 23 crewmen aboard the Capitaine Torres and 16
on the Johanna B were foreigners, including many Filipinos.
   Lt. Jeff Agnew at the search center in Halifax said the coast
guard ship Sir William Grenfell, battling waves as high as a
two-story building, had recovered two empty life rafts and the
wreckage of a third in the area where the Capitaine Torres
disappeared.
   Agnew reported, ``The captain of the Grenfell says he is
convinced he did see some people ... two or more'' on one of the
rafts ``but the wave action on the raft was severe. He saw it take
a few severe hits.
   ``When he managed to get alongside ... it was empty.''
   The Capitaine Torres ship had sent a distress call saying the
cargo had shifted, causing it to list badly, and its crew was
abandoning ship in enclosed rubber rafts about 36 miles north of
Cape Breton. The vessel carried two such rafts and two wooden life
boats.
   It was en route to Taiwan with container cargo and the crew
included French, Fijian, Dutch, Filipino and Vanuatu seaman,
according to maritime officials.
   The coast guard lost contact with the Panamianian-registered
Johanna B shortly after it sent out a mayday signal late Thursday
from a point 120 miles northwest of the Capitaine Torres.
   An agent in Sorel, Quebec, for the Johanna B said the ship had a
cargo of iron ingots and all of the crewmen were Filipinos.
   An Armed Forces' rescue aircraft dispatched to the zone where
the Capitaine Torres disappeared was diverted to the smaller
Johanna B with a pump. Military spokesman said the plane was
believed to be about 10 minutes away from the sinking ship when the
signals ended and it could find no traces of the vessel.
   The plane turned back when navigational aids began failing
because of an ice buildup.
   ``They didn't see anything,'' said Capt. Claude Tardif of
Canadian Forces Base Summerside. ``The visibility was about a
quarter of a mile in severe turbulence and icing conditions.''
   ``It was as bad a day as we've had this fall,'' said Wallace
Meade, owner of a 66-foot fishing trawler in Port aux Basques,
Newfoundland, the nearest port to the lost ships. ``I wouldn't have
gone out in that in a 500-footer.''
   Maritime officials said the Capitaine Torres, carrying cargo
from Portage, Ind., radioed a distress call after some containers
slid overboard in a violent shift of cargo. They said the Capitaine
Torres was built by Hyundai of South Korea in 1978 and flew the
flag of Vanuatu, but was owned by a company in New Caledonia, a
South Pacific island.
   The Johanna B was loaded with 4,600 tons of pig iron and en
route to Darrow, La.
   Crew members of the Grenfell and other coast guard ships
returned to work in spite of a month-old strike by civilian
employees of federal government ships.
   The strikers had said they would respond to emergencies.
Civilians in the Grenfell crew left the picket line beside the ship
and went aboard when the distress calls came in, said union
spokesman Larry Welsh.

   Federal police stormed a prison
Friday to stop fighting between rival inmates that killed five
prisoners and left 41 wounded, officials reported.
   About 40 prisoners broke through a cell partition and attacked
another group of inmates with knives and clubs, according to
Marilena Viania, director of the Evaristo de Moraes prison in
northern Rio.
   She said 200 federal police entered the prison early Friday and
ended the six-hour battle.
   The director said 20 of the injured prisoners were in serious
condition with stab wounds.
   ``It was a power struggle between inmates that got out of
hand,'' she told The Associated Press by telephone. ``For awhile,
it looked as if the whole prison might join the revolt.''
   She said the prison housed 1,300 inmates.

at an apartment building where a well-known television journalist
lives, police said Friday.
   They said the first explosion injured five people at a branch of

midnight Thursday. The second wounded a policeman and three firemen
called to the scene.
   The bank entrance was damaged and windows were shattered in

<TEXT>
   A court Friday ordered prison
authorities to allow an American tourist facing drug charges to
confer with his lawyer privately and be examined by a psychologist.
   Judge Shaik Daud Ismail of the High Court was responding to
applications by Kerry Lane Wiley, 37, of Sacramento, Calif.
   Wiley was charged Nov. 12 in Magistrate's Court with trafficking
in more than a pound of cannabis _ the plant family of hashish and
marijuana _ at a house in the Damansara Heights district.
   On Dec. 1, the Magistrate's Court rejected Wiley's applications
on grounds it had no jurisdiction to order prison authorities to
allow an examination by Kenneth A. Moselle, an American
psychologist practicing in Malaysia.
   Defense lawyer Karpal Singh submitted the applications on
Wiley's behalf. He said his client taught computer programming at a
college in Hawaii and was arrested while visiting a friend in Kuala
Lumpur.
   Singh said it was it was imperative the psychologist examine
Wiley so he could use the report at his trial if necessary.
   Wiley is the first American charged with drug trafficking in
Malaysia, which is punishable by death.
   The charge is described as ``tentative'' until the attorney
general decides on the actual section of the law to apply.
   Since Parliament passed the tough drug law in 1975, 244 people
have been sentenced to death. Eighty-one have have been hanged,
including two Australians and a Briton, and the others await
appeals or execution dates.
   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad describes the drug problem as
the country's ``No. 1 enemy.''
   Malaysia has 140,000 registered drug addicts in a population of
17 million, but officials say only 20 percent or fewer of all
addicts are registered.

<TEXT>
   The New York City bar association said in
a report released Friday that torture has been commonly used in
Turkish police stations and the Turkish legal system failed to
respond to it.
   The 111-page report said torture remained widespread despite
Turkey's ratification of the European Human Rights Convention and
the U.N. Convention against Torture, as well as prohibitions
against torture in Turkish law.
   The findings, ``Torture in Turkey: The Legal System's Response''
were prepared by a delegation of four lawyers from the
association's Committee on International Human Rights.
   Turkey had no immediate response. In the past, government
officials denied torture was practiced systematically, saying there
were only isolated incidents described as police brutality.
   The delegation said it visited Turkey from May 28 to June 8 and
met judges, government officials, prosecutors, lawyers, former
prisoners and detainees.
   The report said torture is often used during the 15-day period
in which prisoners can be held incommunicado after arrest.
   The bar association said forms of torture used include beating
detainees on the soles of their feet, hanging them by their wrists,
hosing them with cold water, applying electric shocks, punching and
kicking, yanking people by the hair, assaults with truncheons,
rolling the detainee inside a tire, and sexual and psychological
abuse.
   The delegation said it was told 84 people died in custody in a
military prison in southeastern Diyarbakir province during 1980-84,
reportedly as a result of torture, but only one police officer was
prosecuted.
   The report also accused the United States of failing to
recognize the seriousness of the human rights problem in Turkey.
The two countries, both NATO members, have a defense accord.

   Leaders of the 12-nation European
Community, closing ranks amid upheaval in Eastern Europe, agreed
Friday to press ahead with an economic and monetary union despite
British opposition.
   The decision, on the opening day of a two-day summit, means the
EC will convene a special conference in December 1990 to start
negotiations for the adoption of a single currency and to set up a
system of central banks.
   The agreement came after France and West Germany overrode
objections by British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher that radical
monetary integration will rob member countries of sovereign rights
to decide national economic policy.
   In another blow to Mrs. Thatcher, the leaders agreed _ with her
alone dissenting _ to adopt a non-binding ``social charter''
setting out community-wide rights for labor unions, wages and
welfare.
   Over dinner, the leaders considered a draft political
declaration that called for ``intensified'' political dialogue and
cooperation with the Soviet Union and other reform-minded nations
of Eastern Europe.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, West German sources said,
also hoped to insert a clause expressing support for German
reunification.
   But French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas reported several
delegations rejected the German phrasing.
   He said the French proposed different phrasing, calling for
reinforcement of peace in Europe that would lead to Germany
``recovering its unity.'' The political declaration states that
recovery must be carried out ``democratically and peacefully,''
Dumas said.
   The final declaration, due to be issued Saturday, was expected
to reaffirm the present borders of East and West Germany.
   Concern has been expressed about the Oder-Neisse border between
East Germany and Poland and a reunified Germany's possible claim to
parts of Poland populated by ethnic Germans.
   The leaders also gave their backing to a French proposal to
create a European Development Bank to help the economies of
emerging democracies in Eastern Europe, but left the details to be
worked out.
   The deal on the monetary union conference was sealed after Kohl
bowed to pressure by the summit host, French President Francois
Mitterrand, to fix December 1990 as the launch date.
   Kohl had hoped to delay the conference start until early 1991,
after West German elections scheduled on Dec. 9, 1990.
   Abolishing West Germany's strong mark currency is an electorally
sensitive subject.
   The inter-governmental conference on monetary union will mark
the start of what are likely to be several years of negotiations to
make necessary amendments to the EC's 1957 founding treaty.
   Britain will attend the conference in what Thatcher aides
described as a ``spirit of constructive argument.''
   Treaty changes require unanimity and Britain can veto any final
move to abolish national currencies or set up the single central
bank system.
   Dutch Premier Ruud Lubbers said the agreement to hold the
conference was ``politically very important.''
   ``It puts pressure on the member states _ this (monetary
integration) is a tall order,'' said Lubbers.
   Mitterrand had sought a dramatic move toward greater unity at
the summit in this city on the French-German border.
   He argues that Western nations must move closer to form a strong
and stable force that can reach out to encourage and help the
emerging democracies of Eastern Europe.
   ``It is important for France,'' a French source said of the
decision to fix a date for the monetary conference. ``Because we
know it is with precise dates that we advance.''
   No formal votes were taken Friday, and only Mrs. Thatcher
objected during the closed-door discussions on the monetary
conference and the social charter.
   She says the charter will increase unemployment, raise costs and
make EC goods less competitive.
   During a pause after the monetary union decision, the convention
center, including the room where the leaders were meeting, was
blacked out in a five-minute power cut.
   Mrs. Thatcher had hoped to focus discussion in Strasbourg on the
practical agenda of completing the single barrier-free market which
the Community is due to become at the end of 1992, and on the EC's
response to events in Eastern Europe.
   Lubbers said the summit would culminate in sending ``a message
of encouragement to those people (in Eastern Europe) who are the
driving forces of reform ... it is a revolution without violence.
You must encourage that.''

<HEAD>Man Arrested in Weapons Case Turns Home Into Military Bunker</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man who crammed his home with
automatic weapons, a cache of explosives, guard dogs and military
lockers was arrested on dangerous weapons charges, authorities said
Friday.
   Glen Lewis, 46, had turned his house into a military bunker,
police said.
   ``He had enough ammunition and firepower (that) he could have
held up in his home for months,'' said Lemon Township Police Sgt.
Vince Lovejoy. ``There were military lockers throughout the house.''
   Lewis had not threatened anyone with the arsenal, police said.
Lovejoy didn't know why the man was storing the weapons.
   ``None of the weapons were stolen,'' Lovejoy said. ``He just
said he collected them, that it was a hobby for him.''
   Police and agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms discovered the arsenal Thursday while searching for a gun
involved in another investigation, said bureau agent Jim Richardson.
   Lewis was charged with five counts of dangerous ordnance after
authorities found five weapons with magazines that held more than
the legal limit of 30 bullets. He was being held at the Middletown
Jail on $12,500 bond Friday.
   Lewis had been loading bullets with gunpowder before authorities
arrived, Lovejoy said.
   He said Lewis said he would fire at walls in his home with a
semi-automatic 9mm weapon and ``if the bullet went through the
wall, he knew he had a good load.''
   Police also found 10 or 11 guard dogs at Lewis' home, and seized
practice rifle-launched grenades, 12 cluster bombs and more than
1,000 rounds of 9mm ammunition, Lovejoy said.
   Also discovered were uniforms from six Ohio and Kentucky police
departments, martial arts weapons, a bullet-proof vest, a flak
vest, smoke grenades, tear gas grenades and seven cans of black
powder, authorities said.
   U.S. Department of Defense investigators have joined the
investigation because of the discovery of military equipment,
Lovejoy said.

   Experts expressed concern Friday that the
rampage by a man who shot to death 14 women might not be an
isolated case of such attitudes toward females, and especially
feminists.
   Television talk shows and newspaper editorials focused on the
massacre Wednesday, the worst in Canada's history. Thirteen people
remained hospitalized Friday. All were expected to recover.
   The gunman, identified by police as Marc Lepine, 25, emerged as
a loner who blamed women for his troubles in life. Lepine shot
himself to death after his assault at the University of Montreal's
engineering school.
   All the victims were between the ages of 21 and 31, and all but
one were students. A joint funeral for 10 victims was scheduled
Monday at Montreal's Notre Dame Cathedral.
   ``The tragedy should persuade us to look intensely at the ground
in which hatred takes root,'' Toronto's Globe and Mail, which
describes itself as Canada's national newspaper, said in an
editorial. ``It is time for men to talk with men about their
continuing oppression of women. Sadly, it is still a time when
women have reason to be afraid.''
   Michael Kaufman, a political scientist, blamed the incident in
part on society.
   ``It was both aberrant and not aberrant,'' Kaufman said on the
CBC's ``Midday'' program. ``These attitudes are bred so young. ...
Boys learn to solve conflicts through violence.''
   A conflict recently attracted national attention at Queen's
University in Kingston, Ontario, when female students staged a
```No' means no'' campaign against date rape. Male students
responded by posting sarcastic signs as ```No' means more beer.''
   Witnesses to the attack Wednesday quoted Lepine as screaming ``I
want the women!'' and ``You're all a bunch of feminists! I hate
feminists!''
   Six women died in one classroom after Lepine separated the men
from the women and opened fire on the women.
   A three-page handwritten letter found on Lepine's body blamed
women for much of his unhappiness.
   Jacques Duchesneau, a senior police investigator, said that when
things weren't going well with a woman, ``he would just stop the
relationship right there and never come back to the person he was
talking with.''
   Duchesneau said Lepine had taken chemistry courses apparently in
hopes of entering the engineering school, although no indication
exists that he applied. ``He said feminists have always ruined his
life, that he wasn't too happy in life particularly in the last
seven years,'' Duchesneau said.
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and his wife, Mila, were among the
visitors Thursday night to the engineering school, which closed in
mourning and postponed final examinations for four days.
   ``This man singled out women in a completely criminal and
insensitive fashion,'' he said. ``It is an isolated incident, but
it raises questions about violence in our society and about
violence against women.''
   Police said Lepine had been obsessed by war movies and
apparently browsed regularly at gunshops. He bought his weapon, a
.223-caliber semi-automatic rifle, at a hunting shop Nov. 21.
   Lepine lived in a second-floor apartment on a narrow,
working-class street in central Montreal.
   Neighbors described him as a man always in a hurry.
   ``He was always running up and down the stairs,'' said Gerard
Claveau, 67, who lives with his wife next door to the Lepine
apartment.
   ``He didn't strike me as a normal person. He had these strange
eyes, sort of cold.''
   Another neighbor, Chantal Dumais, said she often had the feeling
someone in the Lepine apartment was watching her through a window.
She said once when she was changing in her bedroom she realized
someone was peering into her room from Lepine's apartment. She said
she then heard someone ``laughing like crazy.''
   Neighbors said Lepine lived with another man who apparently
moved out of the three-story building about a month ago.
   Claveau said Lepine's mother, who lives nearby with his sister,
used to visit her son's apartment a couple times a month.

   Thousands of people jammed the
narrow streets of Prague's old quarter Friday on the anniversary of
John Lennon's death to ask Communist leaders to ``give peace a
chance.''
   While party officials drew up a list of future government
officials in talks with the opposition across town, 5,000 young
people gathered for the annual ceremony honoring the former Beatle,
who was shot to death Dec. 8, 1980, outside his New York City
apartment house.
   Candles and sparklers shone in the frosty, clear night while
Lennon's lyrics echoed under the archway of beautiful Charles
Bridge: ``All we are saying, is give peace a chance.''
   Speakers read letters from throughout the country supporting the
peaceful democratic revolution that has embraced Czechoslovakia
since mid-November.
   The anniversary observance, illegal until last year, is held at
the ``Lennon Wall,'' a stretch of concrete once covered with
slogans extolling peace and the pop star.
   ``We believe Lennon was a fighter for freedom and that is what
we are doing here, too, is fighting for freedom,'' said 17-year-old
Madla Vacklova, whose little sister accompanied her.
   She said she believed in expressing her political beliefs ``and
this is something we can do here now.''
   Reforms taking place in Czechoslovakia are due in large part to
the young. A peaceful student demonstration Nov. 17 that ended in
police violence shocked the nation and inspired mass protests that
forced the Communist Party to negotiate with the opposition.
   The Lennon celebration has special meaning for young Czechs. It
was one of the first expressions of a desire for change by those
born after a Soviet-led invasion crushed the Prague Spring of
reform in 1968.
   On Friday, the mood was by turns festive and subdued. Dozens of
young soldiers could be seen, in groups of two or three, among
students in pastel parkas and wool coats.
   ``Last year on Lennon day, we were forbidden to leave the
barracks,'' said a 20-year-old sergeant, who would not give his
name. ``Also, to tell you the truth, this was under surveillance
and they were guarding the streets.''
   His comrade said: ``This year, it's all different. We want to
come with all the others to show our support for change.''
   On the bridge, above the crowd, small groups of people sang
Beatles songs, often accompanied by guitars.
   On the old King's Road, other young people sang Christmas carols
a cappella, as they have for as long as anyone can remember.

   Political parties and groups from more than
a dozen Arab nations and the PLO met Friday to form a group to
support the uprising in the Israeli-occupied lands.
   The new Arab Popular Front will officially be announced Saturday
at a mass rally in Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, to mark the second
anniversary of the insurrection, known in Arabic as the intefadeh.
   Iraq's minister of information, Latif Nassayif Jassim, told the
meeting Friday that Arabs should render all material, moral and
political support for the intefadeh _ ``a legendary revolution
which should take its full course to implement its objectives.''
   Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, came to Baghdad late Thursday to address the rally.
   Egypt, Morocco, Jordan and Kuwait were among the countries
represented Friday.
   Iraqi and PLO officials said the Syrians were not invited
because Damascus rejects PLO peace moves, including the declaration
of a Palestinian state.
   The front plans to organize national committees in each Arab
country to organize donations for the Palestinians in the occupied
lands, taken by Israel from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle
East war.

   Earth is wracked by quakes, floods, slides,
storms and volcanoes _ not to mention an occasional 100,000-megaton
whack from an asteroid. But sitting ducks can fight back,
geophysicists said Friday.
   As the American Geophysical Union ended its five-day fall
meeting, suggestions for reducing death and destruction from
natural hazards included requiring tornado shelters in mobile home
parks, planning land use to avoid quake and slide damage, and
steering incoming asteroids away from Earth.
   An asteroid two-thirds of a mile wide hits Earth about every
300,000 years, and today it could kill more than half Earth's
population because of climate and direct effects of a blast equal
to 7.7 million Hiroshima-sized atomic bombs, said Clark Chapman of
the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Ariz., and David
Morrison, of NASA's Ames Research Center in Mountain View.
   Conservatively assuming a 50-year human lifespan, that means any
person has about a one-in-6,000 chance of being killed by an
asteroid during their lifetime, compared with an American's
one-in-20,000 chance of dying on a plane crash or one-in-50,000
chance of being killed by a tornado, said the pair, who wrote the
book ``Cosmic Catastrophes.''
   ``This is, in fact, a real hazard,'' Chapman said. ``We're in a
shooting gallery.''
   Even a small asteroid impact ``could be mistaken for a nuclear
attack,'' he said. ``It might trigger a nuclear attack.''
   One asteroid passed within 500,000 miles of Earth this year,
about twice the moon's distance, and a small one devastated an
uninhabited part of Siberia in 1908. So it makes sense for society
to better evaluate likely consequences of a collision and use
telescopes to provide years' notice of incoming asteroids, Chapman
said.
   ``It's within our technical capabilities to design a space
mission to nudge the asteroid out of the way'' by using special
rocket engines or perhaps H-bombs, although bombs might break an
asteroid into more deadly fragments, he said. ``It would be an
Apollo-project level of expense.''
   Most scientists discussed more common natural disasters during
Friday's session.
   ``It's absolutely imperative we insist mobile home parks have
secure underground shelters'' in tornado and hurricane-prone
regions, said Joseph Golden, senior meterologist for the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
   Golden said home designers need to pay more attention to
wind-resistant cladding for buildings, and build homes with
interior closets and bathrooms, which often are the only parts of a
house left standing after a bad hurricane.
   Better effort also is needed to predict hurricane tracks and
intensities, and to learn if building codes are adequate for
typical wind speeds, he added.
   U.S. Geological Survey volcanologist Robert Tilling said 25,000
people died during the Nevado del Ruiz volcano eruption in Colombia
in 1985 because local officials ignored hazard maps, signs of
impending eruption and formal warnings by scientists.
   He called for better communication between scientists and
officials, increased monitoring of volcanoes that now go unwatched
in developing nations, and improvements in predicting volcanic
activity.
   Earl Brabb, a USGS geologist, said it is ``a national disgrace''
that there is a lack of aerial photographs to identify areas prone
to deadly landslides, which cause tens of billions of dollars
damage globally each year.
   The agency has prepared detailed landslide susceptibility maps
for San Mateo County, south of San Francisco, and county officials
used the maps to rezone hazard areas to very low density housing,
Brabb said.
   The Geological Survey also operates a landslide warning system
in the Bay Area and is establishing one in Honolulu. Warnings are
relayed to the public through the Weather Service and news media.
   ``If your house is adjacent to a steep slope or at the top of a
steep slope, you might consider going to a motel for the weekend''
after a warning, Brabb said.
   Geological Survey seismologist William Ellsworth said
researchers are getting better at making long-term forecasts of
which segments of faults are prone to destructive quakes.
   He said emergency officials believe public safety during the
deadly Oct. 17 San Francisco Bay area quake was improved because
people made preparations after scientists warned in 1988 that the
San Andreas Fault was due for a jolt near the bay's south end.
   Scientists need to spend more time identifying specific sites
prone to quake damage, and be more aggressive using such knowledge
to influence land-use decisions, such as construction on filled
land vulnerable to intense shaking.
   Mark Meier of the University of Colorado urged more detailed
study of future sea level rises so society can ``save a lot of
money'' with land use planning designed to prevent damage from
storm surges and other effects.

   A couple claims in a lawsuit that
Nissan Motor Corp. had a Japanese employee rent a room in their
home to spy on them and collect information about Americans' buying
habits.
   Nissan called the allegations ``totally absurd.''
   Maritza and Stephen French claim fraud, invasion of privacy,
trespassing and unfair business practices against Nissan and
Takashi Morimoto, a Nissan employee who rented a room in their
Costa Mesa home last summer.
   ``They just feel outraged,'' said Nancy Kaufman, the Frenches'
attorney. ``They just wonder what he was writing down, what about
their private lives is in a Nissan file somewhere. They feel
violated, they really do.''
   Nissan denied the couple's claims in a statement issued Friday
from its U.S. headquarters in Carson, Calif.
   ``Mr. Morimoto was very upfront with the French family about the
fact that he worked for Nissan and that he was in the U.S. to
better understand U.S. lifestyles and attitudes about cars,'' the
company said.
   Nissan said that not only was Morimoto not secretive, ``he was
plainly seen in the neighborhood photographing various cars, homes
and garages.''
   The lawsuit, filed Thursday in Orange County Superior Court,
seeks a court order forbidding Nissan from placing alleged
corporate emissaries into the homes of other unsuspecting families.
It also seeks unspecified damages.
   The lawsuit claims the 29-year-old Morimoto misrepresented and
concealed the reason for his six-week stay with the couple and
their two daughters.
   Ms. Kaufman said the French family responded in June to a
newspaper advertisement to find homes for Japanese students.
Placement services said no students were available but suggested
Morimoto, who moved in on June 16.
   Ms. Kaufman said the family knew Morimoto worked for Nissan but
thought he had been temporarily assigned to the firm's U.S.
headquarters in Carson.
   Morimoto stayed until July 31. The family learned of Morimoto's
alleged mission in October, when the Los Angeles Times reported
that Morimoto had been dispatched to Costa Mesa as part of an
effort to design a future car model designed especially for the
U.S. market.
   The newspaper article on Southern California car culture said
Morimoto was to ``unearth'' the lifestyle of an American town and
was among several ``operatives'' lured there by its trend-setting
image.
   In its statement, however, Nissan said the article ``was
actually sent to the French family by Nissan because we thought
they would enjoy it.''
   The lawsuit also named Makoto Tachikawa, a product strategy
director for Nissan, and two organizations involved in placing
Morimoto in the home, the Academic Recruit Communication
International of Los Angeles and the Japanese American Cultural
Center.
   A spokeswoman for the center said they were merely the landlord
for the other group. Terry Terasaki, an assistant to Gachiey
Nomura, the head of Academic Recruit Communication, said Mrs.
Nomura was out of town Friday and the only person who could discuss
the case in detail.
   Terasaki acknowledged that his organization placed Morimoto in
the Frenches' home, but said he had learned of the couple's
allegations for the first time Friday.

<BYLINE>Former NBC Head Grant Tinker Says Gannett Split Amicable ^By JAY
SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   TV producer Grant Tinker, a former NBC chairman,
said Friday that the recent mutual decision of himself and Gannett
Co. to end their TV production partnership was amicable and ``just
as friendly as it could be.''
   The latter is a media company that publishes the USA Today
newspaper.
   GTG Entertainment, the Tinker-Gannett partnership, was formed in
1987. It produced the ill-fated ``USA Today on TV,'' which is
ending in January after 15 months, low ratings and a start-up cost
of $40 million.
   Gannett, Tinker said, ``just made a strategic decision that it's
(TV production) a business that they would just as soon not be in,
since it's not connected to what they do.
   ``And the fact we did not come out of the gate too quickly
probably helped them make (the decision).''
   GTG currently produces one network series, ``Baywatch,'' which
NBC recently approved for a full season.
   It also has gotten got CBS approval for a pilot for a comedy
series, ``Peace of Cake,'' and has three syndicated series in the
works, two of which probably would be shown at a national programs
convention next month in New Orleans, he said.
   Work on all those will continue, he said, while arrangements are
made for a new partner to replace Gannett. He said there have been
inquiries, but that nothing will be done ``until we can take
inventory.''
   He expects that process to be finished the middle of next week,
he said in a phone interview from GTG offices in Culver City, Ca.
   Tinker also said he doesn't want to return to network life, but
that two top producers considered to head CBS' programs department
would be ``great for CBS.''
   He referred to the team of Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner, whose
Carsey-Werner Co. produces network television's two top-rated
series, NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' and ABC's ``Roseanne.''
   Until late Friday, when their negotiations with third-place CBS
ended unsuccessfully, they were being wooed by it to run CBS
Entertainment, the network's top programs job. The post was left
open last week when Kim LeMasters resigned after only two years in
it.
   Tinker, who spoke before the negotiations were called off, had
said he hoped the two executives would join CBS ``because I think
that would be great for CBS, and for those of us who want to do
business with CBS.''
   Credited with helping lead NBC to first in prime time ratings
before he left the company in 1986, Tinker laughed when asked if
CBS at some point had asked him about taking over LeMaster's job.
   ``Oh, no,'' he replied, then in a joking reference to his old
chairman's job at NBC, said, ``Hey, you're demoting me.'' He said
he had no desire to return to network life, ``nor was I asked'' to
by CBS.

   The army confined more than 1 million Arabs to
their homes and deployed extra troops Friday as Palestinians marked
the second anniversary of their uprising against Israeli occupiers.
   Israel's top leaders, meanwhile, agreed to send Foreign Minister
Moshe Arens to meet his American and Egyptian counterparts for
peace talks.
   Because of the widespread curfews and damp, rainy weather,
streets in many towns and refugee camps in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip were deserted except for military patrols.
   No major violence was reported, but the army said rock throwing
and early morning disturbances prompted at least some of the
curfews, on eight West Bank refugee camps and at least five towns
and villages.
   In Gaza, two Palestinians were shot and wounded when they left
their homes in violation of curfew orders, Arab reporters said.
   Underground Palestinian leaders have called for a general strike
throughout the occupied lands Saturday to usher in the third year
of the ``intefadeh,'' the rebellion that began in Gaza's Jebaliya
refugee camp on Dec. 8, 1987.
   Since then, Palestinians have staged hundreds of strikes and
thousands of protests to demand an end to Israeli rule in the West
Bank and Gaza. Captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle
East War, the two territories are home to 1.7 million Palestinians.
   During the uprising, 626 Palestinians have been killed by
Israelis, and 155 others have been slain by fellow Arabs, most on
suspicion of collaboration with Israel. Forty-three Israelis have
died in the violence.
   Deputy Finance Minister Yossi Beilin said on Israel radio that
the revolt was costing Israel about $1 billion a year.
   ``It is already enough to fill the budgets of six or seven
government ministries,'' he complained.
   The most dramatic incident Friday was in Arab east Jerusalem,
annexed by Israel after its capture from Jordan 22 years ago.
   About 300 Palestinians gathered outside the Old City's Al Aqsa
Mosque, one of Islam's holiest shrines, after prayer services and
chanted ``PLO! Israel No!'' and other anti-Israeli slogans.
   Three youths, their faces masked with Arab scarves, waved an
outlawed Palestinian flag. One placard raised by the demonstrators
read: ``Congratulations to the intefadeh.''
   Police snipers and anti-terror squads were stationed on rooftops
overlooking the mosque, but they did not intervene and the
demonstration ended quietly.
   At least 1,800 extra policemen and paramilitary border police
were stationed in Jerusalem to prevent violence, and officials said
400 more would be brought in for Saturday's strike.
   Troops also were sent to the occupied territories and along the
borders with Lebanon, Jordan and Egypt to block guerrillas from
infiltrating in support of the uprising anniversary.
   Israeli officials claimed Friday that Yasser Arafat's Fatah PLO
faction was behind an infiltration attempt by five armed guerrillas
who were intercepted and killed near the border with Egypt.
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
Fatah squad planned a ``mass killing'' to mark Friday's second
anniversary of the Palestinian uprising.
   The guerrillas, armed with automatic rifles and 51 hand
grenades, were killed in a hilly area of the Negev Desert near
Mount Harif on Tuesday. It was the fifth infiltration attempt from
Egypt this year, according to army figures.
   The Gaza Strip's 750,000 residents were under curfew for a
second consecutive day Friday, and a curfew imposed on Nablus, the
West Bank's largest town with 120,000 people, remained in force for
an eighth day.
   The markets in Bethlehem and Ramallah, major Arab towns near
Jerusalem, were closed down by security forces and shoppers were
ordered home, residents said.
   Despite the curfew, fresh uprising graffiti appeared on walls in
some towns and refugee camps. In Hebron, one slogan in black said:
``Intefadeh until victory. We die standing and not kneeling.''
   On the other side, Jewish settlers drove through the West Bank
and hung blue-and-white Israeli flags from utility poles and
scrawled slogans on Arab-owned homes to assert their right to the
disputed land.
   ``We will fight to the end,'' said one slogan written in Hebrew
on a wall in Bethlehem.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said in an interview published
Friday in the daily Yediot Ahronot that he could not predict when
the uprising would end.
   ``I can only say that after two years that it has run wild,
those who are arranging and initiating it have not obtained
anything and ... they will also obtain nothing,'' he said.
   Asked what he would do if he were a Palestinian, Shamir replied:
``If I had to put on the other shoe of the Palestinians, I would
want a Palestinian state, a state where the Palestinian people were
ruling.''
   But Shamir, who opposes surrendering any occupied land, said
such a state already exists in neighboring Jordan.
   Israel's four senior leaders met in Jerusalem and agreed to U.S.
Secretary of State James A. Baker III's proposal for a meeting with
his Israeli and Egyptian counterparts as a first step in the Middle
East peace process.
   Baker urged such a meeting in Washington to lead to
Israeli-Palestinian talks on Israel's proposal for elections in the
occupied territories.
   Cabinet Secretary Eliakim Rubinstein said the leaders of the
coalition government agreed to send Arens to the meeting but wanted
preliminary talks first to decide the time and whether it would be
in Washington.
   Friday's meeting was attended by Shamir and Arens of the
right-wing Likud bloc and Finance Minister Shimon Peres and Defense
Minister Yitzhak Rabin of the center-left Labor Party.
   In Baghdad, Iraq, political parties and groups from more than a
dozen Arab nations and the PLO met Friday to form a group to
support the uprising in the Israeli-occupied lands.
   The new Arab Popular Front will officially be announced Saturday
at a mass rally in Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, to mark the second
anniversary of the insurrection.
   The front plans to organize national committees in each Arab
country to organize donations for the Palestinians in the occupied
lands.

   President Bush spoke glowingly Friday of improving
relations with the Soviet Union, saying his summit meeting with
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was aimed toward peace ``rich
with the promise of permanence.''
   ``Yes there were differences at Malta,'' he said. But he added,
``We can express them in an agreeable and forceful way without
being disagreeable.''
   Bush made his remarks at a fund-raiser for Rep. Hank Brown, a
Colorado Republican running for the Senate.
   The president's comments about U.S.-Soviet relations were upbeat
throughout, with no mention of his negative comments the night
before when he told a Houston audience that Soviet activities with
Cuba and Nicaragua ``weigh heavily'' on the relationship.
   Bush said he envisions the decade of the 1990s as ``filled with
optimism, hope and a sense of new beginnings.'' And he heralded
``new beginnings as democracy blooms behind what used to be called
the Iron Curtain.''
   Earlier this week, a senior administration official, commenting
anonymously, had characterized Gorbachev's economic views as
``simplistic.'' And Vice President Dan Quayle had made remarks less
rosy than Bush did on his return from the summit.
   However, presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater quickly
disavowed the ``simplistic'' quote on behalf of the White House.
   And Quayle said in an interview with the Soviet newspaper
Izvestia, released Friday, that he regarded the summit as a ``very
positive'' meeting that could lead to conclusion of an agreement on
strategic nuclear arms by next summer.
   ``So we're very hopeful for improved relationship, for new
opportunities for reduction of tensions,'' Quayle said. He added,
``But as we are hopeful, we must also maintain our preparedness,
and that we will do.''
   Bush has used his series of speeches at Republican fundraising
events over the past two days to reflect on his summit meeting with
Gobachev.
   In Des Moines, Iowa Friday night at a fundraising banquet for
Rep. Tom Tauke, a 1990 Senate contender, Bush said, ``From Malta
came initiatives to nurture Europe's tide toward democracy,
accelerate arms control, and expand trade.''
   He reiterated his goal of granting the Soviet Union
most-favored-nation trade status by the time he and Gorbachev meet
next spring in the United States.
   ``This will relax trade barriers between East and West _
expanding markets for American agricultural and other exports,''
Bush said.
   In Denver, Bush said, ``Our mission to Malta was about peace.
Not the kind of uneasy peace we've known for the last 40 years _
hard and cold _ but about the new kind of peace we aspire to. One
that is rich with the promise of permanence.''
   He spoke of his hopes for ``a new American-Soviet relationship.
We took our first step toward the next decade and the new world
that is taking shape _ a new world of security and freedom.''
   Bush also issued a written statement noting the earthquake that
devastated Soviet Armenia a year ago Thursday.
   Recalling the assistance provided by U.S. government and private
groups, and the Soviet offer of help after this year's San
Francisco-area quake, Bush said, ``As we look to a new era in
U.S.-Soviet relations, we can take hope from these examples of
humanitarian cooperation between our two countries.''

   Students who met with President Bush on Friday say
the president could be doing more in his war on drugs. Some of them
also disagreed with his stands on abortion and women.
   But they were all impressed that the president took time to sit
down with them and listen to what they had to say.
   Anna Valdez said she asked Bush about abortion, and accused the
administration of cutting back social programs. She said the Bush
administration should be doing more to provide child care.
   Valdez said Bush favored the right of parents to choose child
care, but did not favor a government program.
   ``I don't see the logic of his policy at all,'' said the John F.
Kennedy High School senior. ``If he's pro-life, then he should
support head start and other programs for children who already
exist.''
   Bush, on a three-state, two-day trip in which he was mixing
anti-drug speeches with Republican fund-raising, met privately with
a group of about two dozen students.
   Alex Kennaugh, a junior, said he asked the president what he
would do if he were leading the drug war in Colombia, and the
president responded that he would try to halt the export of drugs.
Kennaugh said he agreed, but thought the administration could do
more to educate young people about drug dangers.
   Hector Sanchez said he told Bush that the administration is
focusing on drugs such as cocaine, crack and a new cocaine
derivative called ``ice,'' but is getting away from fighting one of
the most abused drugs at the school, alcohol.
   ``Kids are being killed because of alcohol,'' Sanchez said.
   Sanchez said Bush denied overlooking alcohol, and told him the
administration is doing what it can.
   Bush later left Denver for Des Moines, where about 20
schoolchildren stood out in cold in the mid-20s Friday night to
watch the arrival of Air Force One.
   The pupils from Andrew Jackson Elementary School said they found
their glimpse of Bush ``neat,'' ``fun'' and ``interesting.''
   Bush was in Iowa for a radio discussion with farmers and a
political dinner for Rep. Tom Tauke, R-Iowa.

<HEAD>Bush: Subsidy-Free Agricultural Trade is `Utopian Vision' for Now</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN P. ROSENFELD</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The administration's goal of eliminating
worldwide agricultural subsidies is ``an utopian vision'' that
can't be achieved soon, President Bush said Friday night.
   The president's comments came in a radio interview in the heart
of the Corn Belt during a brief campaign stop on behalf of Rep. Tom
Tauke, the Iowa Republican who is attempting to unseat Democratic
Sen. Tom Harkin in 1990.
   A policy seeking to remove barriers to sales of U.S. farm
products abroad, set by the Reagan administration and continued by
Bush, seeks the elimination of all trade-distorting practices such
as quotas and export subsidies.
   ``It's a good thing to have. But I don't see that happening all
at once,'' Bush said in an interview at WHO, a station where Reagan
once was a sportscaster.
   Critics have said free trade in farm products would eliminate
safety nets that ensure farming will remain profitable enough to
assure a stable and safe food supply and would open the possibility
of a flood of foreign meats and grains into U.S. markets.
   Others have argued that practices such as import-limiting quotas
raise prices to consumers, and that export subsidies, such as those
the United States and European countries employ on a variety of
products, stifle farm development in the poor countries of the
Third World.
   Subsidy defenders have argued that the United States cannot do
without them as long as competitors use them.
   ``I still believe an Iowa farmer can compete with anybody in the
world, provided they don't tie one hand behind his back and then
tell him to fight,'' Bush said at one point.
   The president's trade representative, Carla Hills, has sought to
make similar points, saying this summer, for instance, U.S.
negotiators in the farm trade talks of the General Agreement on
Tarriffs and Trade would not ``unilaterally disarm'' American
producers by giving up the questioned practices without getting
something in return.
   Two Democratic members of Congress later said on the same
station they were pleased to hear that the president does not
expect all trade barriers to fall at once.
   Harkin said he underlined his notes when Bush called the
elimination of government subsidies ``utopian.''
   ``Boy am I glad to hear him say that,'' Harkin said.
   Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., said by telephone, ``The way the
world is set up, we'll probably never reach the utopian view that
all nations will lower their subsidies.''
   Questioned by Bob Quinn, the station's news and farm information
director, about prospects for expanding markets for U.S.
commodities in Eastern Europe, Bush said those countries first need
to reform their economies before they will be in any shape to
increase purchases from the West.
   While he said that, too, would take time, ``I don't see anything
other than continued increased exports for American agricultural
products for a long time.''
   Bush said while the questions focused on Eastern Europe, ``I
still want to see us make progress in terms of knocking down the
barriers with western Europe, and we're trying.''
   The Soviet Union already is a large purchaser of U.S. grains,
using export subsidies.

   A man on the city police's 10 Most Wanted
List was arrested Friday when he walked into the police station to
bail out a friend.
   A picture of Kevin L. Jones, 20, charged in an October shooting,
was posted on the wall of the Richmond Police Department when Jones
walked in, said a police officer who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   ``He looked up at the picture. His girlfriend looked up at the
picture. Everyone else looked up at the picture. He got arrested,''
the officer said.
   Jones had to know warrants were out for his arrest, the
spokesman said. He was charged with felonious assault and use of a
firearm in the commission of a felony.
   The friend had to make other arrangements for bail and Jones was
confined in the Richmond lockup.

   A gunman described in a pyschological
examination as unlikely to harm his ex-wife burst into her house
early Friday and killed her, their two daughters and her new
husband before killing himself.
   Neighbors identified the man, who left a note telling his
parents he was ``sorry for what he had to do,'' as Ronald Richard
Burris, 46.
   The others, all shot to death, included his ex-wife, Shirley Mae
Woody, 41, the couple's daughters, Vicki Marie Burris, 14, and Anne
Marie Burris, 6, and Shirley Woody's husband, Robert James Woody,
31.
   It was one of three murder-suicides reported around the nation
on Friday in which 12 people died.
   In Belleville, Ill., a man identified as 48-year-old Kurt
Steibel shot and killed his wife, daughter and 1-year-old grandson,
then shot at firefighters before committing suicide by re-entering
his burning home, authorities said.
   After firefighters recovered Steibel's body, they found the
bodies of his wife, Carolyn, and his daughter Cindy Townley, whose
ages were unavailable, and his grandson, Eric Townley. X-rays
showed that they had been shot to death. Police said they hadn't
determined a motive.
   In Buxton, N.D., authorities said farmer Wayne Nygaard, 42,
apparently shot his wife, Carol, 40, and their 11-year-old
daughter, Kate, before turning the gun on himself. The bodies were
found by the couple's 17-year-old son; authorities did not cite a
motive.
   In the Washington state case, authorities said Burris was armed
with a handgun and a shotgun.
   ``We have seasoned firefighters who were disturbed at what they
found,'' Fire District Capt. Bruce Carpenter said of the scene.
   ``We don't know for sure why he did it, except here you have an
ex-husband and a divorce that wasn't the nicest in the world,''
Curt Benson, spokesman for the Pierce County Sheriff's Department,
said as he stood on the rainswept, tree-lined street outside the
home.
   Divorce and child custody and support records, along with a 1988
court order barring Burris from contact with his ex-family, show a
19-year marriage that broke up in 1987 after Shirley Burris accused
her husband of sexually molesting their daughters.
   The accusation, investigated by state child protective workers,
did not result in criminal charges against Burris, according to
records on file at the Peirce County Clerk's office in nearby
Tacoma.
   Burris, who was a civilian logistics supply official at nearby
McChord Air Force Base, denied the allegations in the divorce and
custody papers, calling them ``a wilfull and malevolent'' charge.
   His ex-wife later called him ``so anti-mother that the girls
resent it.'' That comment was made in a sworn statement used to
uphold a February 1988 restraining order barring Burris from
contact with his daughters and living within two miles of his
ex-wife's home.
   A psychological examination in September 1988 found that if
Burris was ``seriously inclined to do her harm, he would already
have done so,'' according to custody dispute records. Burris
submitted to the exam as a condition for getting the restraint
order lifted.
   Benson said Burris awoke his victims when he smashed through a
sliding glass door at the rear of the house and shot Woody in the
couple's bedroom as he called sheriff's deputies to report the
break-in.
   When deputies arrived minutes later, at about 5:12 a.m. PST,
they found Burris' body in the living room where he had committed
suicide, Benson said.
   ``We then went into the master bedroom. We found a husband and
wife on the floor. Both died of apparent gunshot wounds.''
   Anne, 6, was found dead in her bedroom, and a 14-year-old Vicki
was shot in the doorway to her room, he said.
   Principals at the schools the girls attended said they had told
their pupils of the deaths and brought in psychologists to counsel
the children.

<HEAD>Castro Says East Europe's Winds of Change Not for Cuba</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cuban President Fidel Castro rallied
Communists around the world to defend socialism against the East
bloc reforms, which he said could only hurt Cuba's economy, an
official Cuban report said Friday.
   He said capitalism was gaining unusual strength in socialist
countries but rejected it as a means of solving Cuba's problems. He
said it would mean a loss of sovereignty and independence,
declaring, ``We would be an extension of Miami.''
   Some Eastern European countries have teams of Americans
programming their capitalist development, Castro said in his speech
late Thursday.
   Castro spoke for nearly an hour at funeral services for more
than 2,000 Cubans killed abroad over the past 14 years, most of
them in Africa, the Cuban government news agency Prensa Latina said
in a dispatch monitored in Mexico.
   If destiny assigns Cuba the role of being one of the last to
defend socialism, ``it will do it down to the last drop of its
blood,'' Prensa Latina quoted Castro as saying.
   He said his speech was directed ``to those who think we will not
be able to resist the changes that are occurring in Europe.''
   ``We can only expect negative consequences for the economy of
the country'' from the changes, he said. He did not elaborate.
   The Cuban president contrasted Cuba's socialism with that of
Eastern Europe, saying, ``Socialism did not arrive here through the
victorious divisions of the Red Army, but was forged with the
heroism of the Cubans.''
   Prensa Latina said he described as repugnant articles in the
Soviet press criticizing the Soviet system. Cuban authorities did
not hesitate in blocking circulation of the publications, he said.
   Castro spoke after Cubans lined up for hours for a silent
procession past the coffins of soldiers and civilian technicians
killed in Angola, Ethiopia and other African conflicts.
   Most workers were given the day off to attend the services in
five cemeteries and more than 160 mausoleums built for the war
victims.
   President Jose Eduardo dos Santos of Angola and government
representatives from Ethiopia attended the ceremonies.
   The government said this week that 2,289 Cubans were killed in
the conflicts, 2,016 of them in Angola. The remains of all but
about 100 were returned to this island nation and sent to their
hometowns.
   More than 400,000 Cubans have taken part in Cuban missions
abroad, mostly in Africa. At the peak of the Angolan war, Cuba had
50,000 troops and civilians there.
   Cuba agreed to withdraw all troops from Angola by 1991 under an
agreement negotiated by Chester Crocker, former U.S. assistant
secretary of state for African affairs. Cuba no longer has troops
in Ethiopia.

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hills Bros. Coffee, the nation's
third-largest coffee distributor, announced Friday it has suspended
for 30 days any new deals to buy coffee from El Salvador .
   The San Francisco-based marketer of Hills Bros., MJB and Chase &amp;
Sanborn said the decision came in the wake of ``deep concern''
expressed by consumers about fighting and rights violations in El
Salvador during recent weeks.
   In Cincinnati on Friday, peace activists urged Procter &amp; Gamble
Co. not to buy coffee from El Salvador as part of an effort to
pressure the Salvadoran government to negotiate a settlement to
that country's civil war.
   The food products giant, which said it purchases just 3 percent
to 5 percent of its coffee from El Salvador, refused.
   ``We don't make foreign policy decisions for the United
States,'' said P&amp;G spokesman Donald Tassone. ``Right now, the
United States has an open trade policy with El Salvador, and we're
following that policy by buying some coffee beans from El Salvador
for our blend.''
   In San Francisco about three weeks ago, a group called Neighbor
to Neighbor called for a boycott of Salvadoran coffee, a $200
million cash crop to the Central American country that accounts for
about 5 percent of the coffee consumed in the United States.
   Hills Bros. spokeswoman Laurie Chase said Hills Bros. and its
parent company, Nestle, met with Neighbor to Neighbor
representatives to discuss the Salvadoran situation and agreed to
suspend coffee purchases from that nation while more closely
examining the situation.
   Chase did not have figures to indicate the amount of coffee
purchased from El Salvador by Hills Bros., but said it wasn't ``a
significant amount at all.''
   More than 70,000 lives have been lost in violence in El Salvador
during the past decade. Six Jesuit priests were murdered there
about a month ago. About 80,000 Salvadoran refugees live in the San
Francisco Bay area.

   The Hispanic community launched a drive Friday to
raise money on behalf of a Colombian-born policeman convicted of
killing two black men, while religious leaders declared a weekend
of prayer to unify the races.
   Black leaders have hailed the manslaughter conviction of Miami
Officer William Lozano, 31, as a victory for justice. But many
Hispanics, particularly those in the 200,000-strong Colombian
community, say the officer was a scapegoat to racial politics. The
deaths of the two black men touched off three days of rioting in
January.
   Colombian-oriented radio stations WOCN-AM and WKAT-AM have
organized drives to help the officer and his family. Lozano's
tearful mother went on the air Friday morning to ask for help in
paying legal expenses for his appeal.
   ``My son, to everyone who has always known him, wouldn't hurt or
kill anyone without reason,'' she pleaded. ``We need money.''
   Lozano himself took to the airwaves on Spanish-language
television Friday evening, saying he was a symbol for police
officers around the country.
   ``It's now my duty as a police officer in the situation that I'm
in, to protect the civil rights of all policemen who are patrolling
the streets,'' he said, adding that he was publicly fighting his
conviction ``so that they can enforce the law the way they should
be able to.''
   WOCN scheduled a radiothon and rally at noon Saturday to raise
funds and seek signatures on a petition asking Circuit Judge Joseph
Farina to show leniency when he sentences Lozano on Jan. 24. Lozano
and his family are expected to participate in the broadcast, said
afternoon news coordinator Fernando Escobar.
   To help heal the wounds between blacks and Hispanics, a group of
Jewish, Protestant and lay religious leaders held a joint news
conference declaring a weekend of prayer for the families of Lozano
and the shooting victims, Clement Lloyd and Allan Blanchard.
   ``I think the worst thing we can do as a community is to sit
back smugly and say we came through this time without fires and
riots,'' said Rabbi Solomon Schiff, chairman of Dade County's
Community Relations Board.
   He also called for new economic programs, including asking
businesses to hire blacks in proportion to their numbers in the
community.
   The Rev. Vane Eubanks, a black minister and president of People
United to Lead the Struggle for Equality, said impromptu
celebrations after Thursday's verdict celebrated a victory for
justice, not the conviction of Lozano.
   ``We are not a bloodthirsty lynch mob out to get someone,''
Eubanks said, adding even an acquittal would not have caused a riot
because the black community could see the trial was conducted
fairly.
   Roman Catholic officials, who represent a largely Hispanic
following, did not attend the news conference. However, Mary Ross
Augusta, a spokeswoman for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Miami,
said church officials had been in contact with the Community
Relations Board and parish priests intended to speak out on the
issue of racial unity this weekend.
   Remarks by some Hispanic leaders, however, suggest they will not
be easily appeased.
   ``We are deeply hurt,'' said Hernando Torres, executive
secretary of the Colombian American Political Action Committee.
``We are convinced that Officer Lozano was doing his duty defending
the community.''
   Although Colombians have led the drive to support Lozano, many
in the larger Cuban-American community see the verdict as a blow to
all Hispanics.
   ``Mr. Lozano, being Latin, was sacrificed to appease a segment
of the community, to prevent riots and burning,'' said David Duenas
Sr., a retiree who said he closely followed the trial.
   Others supported the outcome, saying the trial was fair.
   ``The Hispanic community is mature,'' said Jorge
Hernandez-Torrano, president of the Cuban American Bar Association.
``Its immediate reaction _ sympathy for Lozano _ is natural, but
that will pass.''
   Many police officers _ especially Hispanics _ say they are
dismayed by the verdict, but will not give their names for fear of
retaliation by police officials.
   One said he would be reluctant to enter a threatening situation,
as Lozano did when he stepped into the street and fired a shot at
the motorcycle Lloyd and Blanchard were riding.
   ``I might have to do something _ and I might wind up where
Lozano was today,'' said the officer.
   But police spokesman David Rivero said many officers were
reacting in the heat of the moment.
   ``Any time you're faced with something like that, at first
you're going to be emotional, but after a while things get to
normal,'' Rivero said.
   Since the Jan. 16 shooting, which touched off three days of
racial violence, Lozano has been relieved of duty with pay.
Following his conviction, an administrative hearing was initiated
on possible dismissal, but no decision was expected this week, the
department said.

<HEAD>Hunter Indicted for Manslaughter in Woman's Death</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A hunter who was spared criminal
prosecution when a grand jury refused to indict him in the 1988
shooting death of a woman near her house was indicted for
manslaughter Friday by another grand jury.
   Donald Rogerson was charged in the death of Karen Wood, a
37-year-old mother of young twins who was shot in woods behind her
house in Hermon, a Bangor suburb, on Nov. 15, 1988. The case has
stirred strong emotions among hunters and non-hunters alike in a
state known as a hunting haven.
   Rogerson, a supermarket produce manager and an experienced
hunter, has said he believed he was firing at a deer. Mrs. Wood
died of a single gunshot wound to the chest.
   Rogerson, 46, faces up to 20 years' imprisonment if convicted on
the charge of manslaughter, said Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey
Hjelm, who is prosecuting the case. There is no minimum sentence,
Hjelm said.
   No arraignment date was immediately set.
   Chief Deputy Attorney General James T. Kilbreth, explaining why
the state took the case before a second grand jury, cited news
stories that raised questions about the fairness of the decision by
the first grand jury.
   Kilbreth acknowledged for the first time Friday that ``the most
important aspect'' of the decision to reopen the case was the
discovery that a nephew of Lewis V. Vafiades, Rogerson's attorney
in the case, had served on the first grand jury.
   However, he said there was only the appearance of a conflict and
an investigation by his office had turned up no evidence of any
wrongdoing. The nephew, Vasor Vafiades, has been quoted in news
reports as saying he did not take part in the case.
   Rogerson had initially been charged with manslaughter. But the
first grand jury refused to indict him, finding he had not been
criminally negligent or criminally reckless, and the charge was
dropped.
   Vafiades described Rogerson as ``disappointed, obviously'' at
Friday's grand jury action in Superior Court in Penobscot County,
site of the first grand jury hearing.
   Mrs. Wood's husband, Kevin, who has moved to Iowa with his two
daughters, said he was encouraged by the indictment and that grand
jurors who voted to indict had reached ``the only decision logic
and reason would allow.''
   Wood, who settled a wrongful death lawsuit against Rogerson in
May for $122,000, said the case should be viewed the same as any
other criminal proceeding, not as a case that pits hunters against
non-hunters.
   State law prohibits hunting within 300 feet of a residence. Game
wardens found that at the time of the shooting Rogerson was 306
feet from the Woods' house and 286 feet from a neighbors' house.

   Two brothers aboard a ship that rammed a fragile
coral reef pleaded innocent Thursday to federal charges of
operating recklessly and while intoxicated.
   The Oct. 25 grounding of the 155-foot Alec Owen Maitland off Key
Largo was the first of three groundings in the Florida Keys during
three weeks.
   State and federal investigators say the empty freighter cut a
200-foot swath through a reef.
   A grand jury Wednesday indicted Michael Anthony Bishop, 43, who
was at the helm, and crew member Jerry Alan Bishop, 40. Both face
misdemeanor counts of operating while intoxicated and operating in
a grossly neglient manner. Each count carries a maximum term of one
year and $100,000 fine.
   The brothers pleaded innocent Thursday and were released on a
$30,000 bond co-signed by their mother. As conditions for their
release, U.S. Magistrate Linnea Johnson ordered them to live with
their mother in Bayou La Batre, Ala.
   No diesel oil leaked from the Maitland's fuel tanks during its
27 hours on the reef four miles east of Key Largo, a popular diving
spot.
   The Coast Guard also filed charges against the captain, Duane
Goodwin, 37, and Michael Bishop. Coast Guard investigators said
Goodwin, the only person aboard licensed to navigate the vessel,
was asleep when the ship ran aground.

   President Bush said Friday he hopes to attend an
anti-drug summit in Colombia in February despite violence there and
he vowed to send ``a message to those merchants of death'' who
traffic in narcotics.
   Bush commented after his drug policy director, William Bennett,
said recent bombings in Colombia have raised new concerns about
safety at the meeting site.
   ``You have to be concerned with everybody's safety in Colombia
these days. It's really very very rough,'' Bennett told reporters
aboard Air Force One as he accompanied Bush on a three-state,
two-day trip in which the president was mixing anti-drug speeches
with Republican fund-raising.
   Violence in Colombia could delay the summit, or even bring about
a new location for it, but ``the burden of proof is still on those
who would argue that you shouldn't go,'' Bennett said.
   And, Bennett said later, ``I think he'll go there.''
   Some White House advisers, and several key members of Congress,
have urged that a new site be found for the summit. But Bush, when
asked by reporters if he was still determined to go to Colombia,
replied, ``I'd like to.''
   The president, addressing students at John F. Kennedy High
School, said his support for Colombian President Virgilio Barco was
unwavering.
   ``Barco has decided, I don't care how much it costs. I don't
care about the threat ... I'm going to do something,'' Bush said.
And he declared it was vital that the United States stand behind
Barco and ``do what we can to support him in his effort.''
   Bush lashed out at ``thugs who plant a bomb outside an office
building,'' referring to the explosion earlier this week in Bogota
that killed 52 people.
   And, he told an assembly at the school, it was important that
there be united action to drive drug traffickers out of business.
``Let us send a message to those merchants of death. ... We are
going to defeat you,'' he said.
   The president was in Denver for the high school anti-drug rally
with members of the Denver Broncos football team. He also attended
a fund-raiser for Republican Rep. Hank Brown, who is seeking the
Senate seat being vacated by Republican William Armstrong.
   Several dozen demonstrators, many carrying signs protesting U.S.
policy in El Salvador, were outside both Denver events.
   Bush told his GOP audience that his summit last weekend with
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was a ``first hopeful step
into a new American-Soviet relationship.''
   ``Our mission to Malta was about peace,'' the president said.
``Not the kind of uneasy peace we've known for the last 40 years _
hard and cold _ but about a new kind of peace. One that is rich
with the promise of permanence.''
   He spoke of ``new beginnings as democracy blooms behind what
used to be called the Iron Curtain.''
   Later, Bush stopped in Des Moines, Iowa, on his way back to
Washington to appear at a fund-raising dinner for Senate hopeful
Rep. Tom Tauke, his third such appearance in two days.
   Four men and two women were arrested for trying to disrup the
speech as about 300 people marched outside the hall to protest U.S.
policies in Central America. ``I'm trying to tell the government of
America to get out of El Salvador,'' one of the two women shouted
as she was dragged away by police.
   Bush also told a local radio station, WHO, that, while he would
work to end trade-distorting government farm subsidies worldwide,
``we can't unilaterally get rid of them while we're being kept out
of certain markets.''
   In a live interview, Bush called an elimination of all farm
subsidies, which former President Reagan had proposed by the year
2,000 _ a ``utopian vision.''
   A snowstorm in the East made Bush cancel plans to spend the
weekend at the presidential retreat in Camp David, Md. in favor of
returning to the White House.
   In Washington, meanwhile, a Pentagon official said Friday that
some Soviet military forces in East Germany have raised their alert
status, but the action apparently is only to protect their bases
and nuclear weapons.
   ``It's a self-protection measure,'' said the official, who spoke
on condition he not be named.
   In light of the political turmoil in East Germany, he said,
``they have taken increased security measures, but it is similar to
something we might do at our bases if there are problems nearby.
... They haven't moved their troops forward, and they aren't
preparing for battle.''
   As for the drug summit in Colombia, Bennett was asked why Bush
wanted to go to violence-torn Colombia.
   ``Barco is brave and courageous. George Bush is brave and
courageous. George Bush just admires the hell out of Barco. You
could see that in a meeting we had in the White House,'' Bennett
said.
   ``I know that if Barco says its important for the president to
be there, the president's going to do it unless it doesn't make
sense.''
   ``I haven't seen any hesitation on the president's part,''
Bennett said. But he added, ``One of the things you have to
consider is not just the security of the president, but the
security of a whole lot of people who go where the president goes.''
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that the White
House is not having second thoughts about Colombia ``but as Bill
says, we continue to evaluate the situation.''
   ``At the moment we think security could be provided and there
are still tentative plans to go. We keep evaluating the situation.
The Secret Service believes they can provide security for the
president.''
   The summit is an attempt to focus international attention on
drug trafficking problems in Colombia, Peru and Bolivia.
   Bennett said that Colombia's battle against drug lords has
``obviously gotten to (them) and they're fighting back very hard.''
   Bush was wrapping up a two-day visit to Texas, Colorado and
Iowa, combining stops for 1990 Republican Senate candidates with
anti-drug appearances.

<TEXT>
   East Germany's embattled Communists on
Saturday proposed for the post of party chairman a 41-year-old
reformist lawyer who has worked for the opposition, a party
spokeswoman said.
   Spokeswoman Brigitte Zimmermann said the lawyer, Gregor Gysi,
was the only candidate for the post.
   She said in briefing reporters on a closed-door session of the
emergency congress that delegates were also choosing a 100-member
party board that will constitute its next leadership, serving under
a chairman.
   That meant the party had abolished its traditional hierarchy of
a general secretary, a Politburo and the policy-making Central
Committee. The structure was a holdover from the Stalinist era.
   Ms. Zimmermann said the 2,753 delegates decided unanimously not
to dissolve the party but also decided by a more than a 3-1 margin
to change its name from the Socialist Unity Party of Germany to a
new name yet to be chosen.
   The Communists have lost much of their control over society in
recent weeks and have granted historic concessions to the
opposition, including opening the Berlin Wall and other borders, in
a desperate effort to shed their Stalinist legacy and remain in
power.
   Mass demonstrations throughout East German demanded reforms,
greater freedom and the prosecution of corrupt former officials.
Tens of thousands of East Germans fled earlier this year to West
Germany.
   Gysi has spoken out for broad political and economic reforms and
has acted as lawyer for the opposition group New Forum. He belonged
to the interim party leadership and heads a committee investigating
corruption allegations against the ousted leadership.
   In an earlier address to the congress, Gysi said the capitalist
system in Western societies was not ``something one cannot learn
from.'' He said it was limited by ``transnational concerns, the
international military-industrial complex.''
   Gysi said the crisis here could only be solved if East Germany
found a ``third way, beyond Stalinist socialism and the power of
transnational monopolies.''
   He called for a ``free competition'' in East German society. He
declared, ``We need a full break with the failed Stalinism,'' which
he blamed for the country's political and economic crisis.
   Earlier, the congress went behind closed doors after a five-hour
debate failed to produce agreement on the course of the emergency
session.
   Many delegates insisted on continuing a debate to explore abuses
of the past. But others insisted that the party first needs new
leadership.
   The deep differences reflected the rifts in the party. Ms.
Zimmermann said membership had dropped from 2.3 million to less
than 1.8 million in recent months.
   Party sources said Premier Hans Modrow also presented a report
on the work of the now-ousted Communist Party Central Committee,
which quit in disgrace on Sunday.
   The historic congress, held in an East Berlin sports hall, began
by debating the party's proposed program that calls for free
elections and broad cooperation with opposition groups.
   Elsewhere in Eastern Europe:
   _Czechoslovakia's Communist leaders offered to surrender their
control over the government for the first time in 41 years and
accept a minority role in a coalition Cabinet.
   _Bulgarian Communists ousted six members of the ruling party
Politburo and 20 members of the policy-making Central Committee,
including former hard-line party chief Todor Zhivkov.
   _The Soviet Communist Party's Central Committee planned an
extraordinary meeting Saturday to set the agenda for the Soviet
Union's parliament next week.
   The East German Communists moved the emergency congress ahead
one week, worried that their slipping control of national affairs
was contributing to an atmosphere of instability. The congress,
shown live on national TV, could continue through Sunday.
   Modrow gave the keynote speech and echoed calls for Communist
Party unity.
   ``Let us not allow the party to be broken, to go under, but
let's make it clean and strong,'' he said, to applause.
   ``We, too, are the people,'' Modrow said, referring to the
slogan widely used by pro-democracy demonstrators.
   Modrow, one of the few Communists with broad popularity, also
ruled out reunification of the two Germanys.
   ``Reunification is not on the agenda,'' he said as the delegates
broke into long applause.
   The German state was divided into Communist East Germany and
capitalist, pro-Western West Germany after the defeat of Adolf
Hitler's Nazi regime in World War II.
   Herbert Kroker, chairman of the party's 25-member interim
leadership committee, told delegates they were dealing not only
with the fate of the party but also with the fate of East Germany.
   If the party split, Kroker said, ``we would also destroy the
hope for a free and cohesive society that we and the others want.''
   The Socialist Unity Party, as the Communists are officially
known, was created in 1946 through the forced merger of the German
Communist Party and the Social Democrats.
   Party leader Walter Ulbrich ruled until 1971, when he was
replaced by Erich Honecker.
   As hundreds of thousands of East Germans began taking to the
streets in October to demand free elections and other democratic
reforms, the hard-line Honecker was forced to resign on Oct. 18.
   He was replaced by Egon Krenz, who opened the Berlin Wall and
gave the East Germans the freedom to travel they had not enjoyed
since the wall was built in 1961.
   Krenz also made promises of free elections and other reforms,
but his long-time association with the corruption-wracked Honecker
regime forced him to step down on Sunday, just six weeks after
taking office.
   The ruling Politburo and the entire 163-member policy-making
Central Committee also resigned in an unprecedented move. The
leadership was replaced by the 25-member panel of reformers, who
drew up the party's new program.
   Honecker and 11 other former high-ranking officials have been
expelled from the party. Honecker, 77, is under criminal
prosecution, and seven former Politburo members have been
imprisoned on corruption charges.

   Nine monkeys that have been made immune to the
simian AIDS virus may hold in their blood cells and tissues the
critical clues needed by scientists to develop an AIDS vaccine for
humans.
   ``These are now very valuable animals,'' said Michael
Murphey-Corb, head of a team of scientists at the Delta Regional
Primate Research Center in Covington, La. ``There's a lot we can
learn from them.''
   In a study published today in the journal Science, Murphey-Corb
and her Tulane University colleagues announced they have developed
a vaccine that protects rhesus monkeys from simian immunodeficiency
virus (SIV), which causes AIDS in monkeys.
   Other AIDS researchers praised the work, one calling it a
``giant leap'' in the race to find a human AIDS vaccine.

   The Soviet Union is packing up MiG-23 fighter
jets based at Vietnam's Cam Ranh Bay, the U.S.-built port the
Soviets turned into their largest naval facility outside their
borders, administration sources say.
   ``There have been a series of reports that they have been
disassembling and packing up their MiG-23s for shipment,'' said one
source, who spoke on condition he not be identified by name.
   ``The reports have triggered speculation the Soviets might be
scaling down, or could be preparing a pullout from Cam Ranh Bay.''
   The changes indicate ``it could be a complete pullout, or it
could lead to a significant reduction'' in Soviet military
involvement at the base, the source said Thursday.

marketing executive sends a clear signal that the government won't
tolerate illegal trafficking of classified Pentagon documents
within the defense industry, says the U.S. attorney whose office
tried the case.
   A U.S. District Court jury deliberated only two hours Thursday
before convicting Richard Lee Fowler on 39 counts arising from his
possession of secret Defense Department and National Security
Council budget documents.
   Fowler, a 64-year-old former Air Force officer who had worked in
the Pentagon, could be sentenced to 310 years in prison and fined
$225,000. Sentencing was set for Jan. 12.
   Fowler's lawyers said they would appeal.

   The Ku Klux Klan's offer to join
protesters at an abortion clinic Saturday has angered the group's
leader who contends ``they're only concerned about white babies
being killed.''
   ``Their robes and hoods, which represent a long history of hate
and violence, will only draw attention away from the real issue,''
said Rick Horton, president of the Tarrant County Pro-Life Action
Network.
   Horton rescheduled his group's demonstration to avoid picketing
alongside the Klan, drawing the wrath of Bill Walton, Grand Dragon

   ``It's just like them to always run,'' Walton said. ``The

   Super Mario must face fire-breathing dragons,
death-dealing birds and a gauntlet of other fantasy threats to
rescue a kidnapped princess. But can Nintendo's video-game star
handle a federal investigation?
   The chairman of a House panel demanded one Thursday, as he
suggested the maker of the immensely popular electronic games is
using unfair and abusive sales practices to monopolize the market
and keep prices high.
   Super Mario, as just about any school-age child knows, is one of
a legion of characters in the games sold by Nintendo. He has leaped
from the video screen to T-shirts, lunch pails and cereal boxes.
   With Mario bouncing across a screen next to him, Rep. Dennis
Eckart, D-Ohio, said at a news conference that he has asked the
Justice Department's antitrust division to investigate Nintendo of
America Inc. for possible violations of antitrust laws.

<HEAD>The Elderly: Penalized For Working</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds; Retransmitting to fix key word</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By John CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of older people is growing but
benefits for the elderly may be heading in the opposite direction.
It is a situation with explosive potential.
   In some respects the position of the elderly today is in sharp
contrast to that of just a few years ago, when some studies warned
against inordinate gray power, or the success of the elderly in
lobbying Congress for greater benefits.
   In recent years private pension plans have attempted to cut
health benefits to the elderly, and the government began taxing
Social Security payments. Sharp increases in home equity, source of
security for the elderly, have been muted.
  e against them. Restraints on inflation have been
a plus for those on fixed incomes. Should hig Not all has gonh-level inflation
reappear, Social Security beneficiaries have some protection
through escalation clauses.
   But the big issues aren't easily resolved. Rising health-care
costs are endangering corporate benefits plans. Attempts to make
life easier for the elderly run headlong into whether it is fair to
tax youth for the cost.
   Particular problems apply to the handling of Social Security,
which many critics say is working on outdated assumptions.
   James Ivers, fits.
   Beyond those dollar limits, beneficiaries lose 50 cents on the
dollar.
   For a married worker-beneficiary, not self-employed, says Ivers,
it means the loss of 50 cents because of the income cutoff, another
15 cents to income tax and another 7.5 cents to Social Security
taxes, leaving just 27.5 cents.
   Next year, the maximum that beneficiaries can earn will go up to
$9,360, with benefits reduced by $1 for every $3 earned beyond the
limit. But that still amounts to a 33 percent tax, often on
relatively low wages.
   Ivers, who teaches Chartered Financial Consultants at the
college, which is based in Bryn Mawr, Pa., says informed estimates
exist that as many as 1 million working recipients now lose some
benefits because they incur penalties.
   He estimates that another 100,000 between ages 65 and 70 do not
file for any Social Security benefits because they choose to
continue working full time. Preliminary work has begun in Congress
to relax the restrictions against income, but no bill is
anticipated soon. Still, there appears to be strong sentiment among
some House members to get rid of all income restrictions.
   While the elderly did benefit from a falling income tax rate in
the 1980s, they lost benefits too, among them the extra exemption
that those 65 years or older had been receiving, and the freedom
from taxes on benefits.
   Basically, if a married recipient has an adjusted gross income
of more than $32,000, that recipient pays tax on half the benefits,
says Ivers. He observes that $32,000 can include earnings on
otherwise tax-exempt bonds.
   Additionally, says Ivers, ``I've always wondered why Social
Security is taxed twice; first, when a person pays the system, and
again when they receive the benefits.''
   As the law stands, he continues, there are more inconsistencies.
   He asks, for example, why a person who chooses to work and make
payments into the system until 70 years of age shouldn't receive
benefits for the extra payments.
   He wonders why those who were disciplined enough to save money
for their retirement should be penalized _ perhaps because their
investment income pushed them beyond the limits.
   Whatever the laws are, he said, ``all older people should be
treated equally with each other.''

<HEAD>George Burns Back on the Best-seller List</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Not many best-selling authors will make this
claim: ``I've written eight books and read two.''
   But then, not many authors are 93-year-old comedians such as
George Burns.
   He's back on the best-seller list with ``All My Best Friends''
(Putnam's, $17.95), a reminiscence of his show business pals. Burns
readily admits that he ``talks'' the books to David Fisher, who
does the writing. His own acquaintance with literature ended in the
fourth grade.
   ``I went into show business when I was eight years old,'' he
explained. ``I never went to school. My teacher was Miss Oliver,
and she came to my house. My mother knocked on my door and said,
`Miss Oliver would like to see you.' My mother slammed the front
door and hollered up to me, `Miss Oliver is gone.' I came out and
Miss Oliver was still sitting there.
   ``My school was show business,'' said Burns. ``I wish I had a
better education, but I know all about show business. I love what I
do. Here I am, 93 years old, sitting in my office, they're taking
my picture, I'm being interviewed. It's nice to get up and have
something to do at 93 ... because I can't make any money in bed.''
   Burns was reflecting in the studio office that seems to have
changed little in three decades.
   Nor has George. The raspy wisecracks come with fine-tuned timing
between sips of tea and drags on the omnipresent cigar. He was
asked to reflect on the figures he talks about in ``All My Best
Friends,'' most of them onetime residents of the fabled Comedians'
Round Table at Hillcrest Country Club:
   _ Eddie Cantor: ``He was a very talented man, but he didn't
leave you with much. Cantor mostly had vitality. Once Cantor and
(George) Jessel were playing the Palace. Cantor said something, and
Jessel topped him. Cantor took off his shoe and hit Jessel over the
head and got a big laugh.
   ``Jessel resented that. He went down to the footlights and took
Cantor apart in front of the audience: `He said something and I
topped him. He couldn't think of an answer so he hit me on the head
with his shoe. I'm not working with a talent, I'm working with an
idiot.' When he got through, Cantor hit him again with his shoe and
got the biggest laugh.''
   _ Jimmy Durante: ``A kind, nice, religious man, and everybody
loved him. He was a great talent who took the English language
apart. I didn't know him, but I used to watch Durante when he had a
little band. He was funny then. ... I don't think there was any
`Mrs. Calabash.' I think he made that up. He said it once and the
audience ate it up.
   ``The audience is the answer to everything. If the audience
laughs, it stays in. If the audience doesn't laugh, not only does
the joke not stay in, you don't even stay in the theater.''
   _ Bob Hope: ``He's not a comedian, he's an institution. I just
worked with Bob Hope at Madison Square Garden. He's a wonderful
man, a nice man. Good comedian, very topical. Everything I say fits
my age. I don't say anything that doesn't fit a 93-year-old man. Or
a 93-year-old face.''
   _ Milton Berle: ``He's one of the kids. But he'll make it in
show business. He was very lucky, and so was I. All the fellas I'm
talking about had places to be bad.
   ``His mother took care of him in the early days. She was always
in the theater, and she knew when to laugh and when to applaud. One
day she was in the audience and a man started playing with her
knee. She laughed in the right spots, she applauded.
   ``When Milton got through, she turned around and slapped the man
in the face. She wouldn't interrupt the act.''
   _ Walter Matthau: ``I did `The Sunshine Boys' with Walter
Matthau. I was very lucky to get that movie; I won an Academy
Award. When Walter didn't like the way I read a line, he'd hit me.
He slapped my face five or six times during the picture.''
   _ Al Jolson: ``I'll tell you how great he was. There was a
Jewish guy, son of a cantor. He'd blacken up, get down on one knee
and sing, `I Got a Mammy in Alabammy,' and the audience believed
him. They believed Jolson had a mammy in Alabammy.''
   _ Sammy Davis, Jr.: ``He may be the biggest talent in show
business. Not the biggest entertainer. That was Jolson. But Sammy
has the whole thing: He dances, he's a mimic, he's an actor, he's
everything. He's Jewish, too.''
   Show business is supposed to be rife with jealousy and
backbiting, yet George Burns never says anything bad about his
fellow performers. How come?
   ``I've got no temperament,'' he shrugged. ``What did I do? I
walked out on the stage and said to Gracie, `How's your brother?'
and she talked for 40 years. I never got nervous. To get nervous
you gotta have talent. Gracie got nervous, not me.''

<HEAD>Museum Reveals Extent of Personality Cult Around Romanian Leader</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto Planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE JAHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While displays documenting most of
Romania's 2,000 years of history are crammed into the bottom floor
of the National History Museum, the top story deals with only the
past 24 years _ the era of Nicolae Ceausescu.
   Much of the three hours of state television programming
available nightly is dedicated to singing the praises of the
``Supreme Leader.'' His wife Elena also receives her share of
adulation.
   The state-run newspapers, the only ones sold, often dedicate
more than two-thirds of their contents to the couple: what they are
doing on a particular day, Ceausescu's thoughts, or his importance
to the country.
   Posters of Ceausescu depicting him decades younger than his 71
years decorate offices, cultural institutions and shop windows,
while book stores give prominent displays to works by and about the
leader and his 70-year-old wife.
   At a time when democratic upheaval is sweeping away the last
vestiges of Stalinism in most other parts of the East bloc, a look
at today's Romania and the personality cult surrounding the
Ceausescus is like stepping back to the early 1950s. The Communist
Party maintains total control, and controlling the party is one man.
   The cult around Ceausescu, who assumed control in 1965, is
unequalled, except in North Korea, where Kim Il Sung, the
77-year-old ``Great Leader,'' receives orchestrated public homage
of near religious character.
   Efforts to show Ceausescu in a prominent light even lead
authorities to retouch photographs.
   A photo in some newspapers of Ceausescu visiting a shipyard in
the Black Sea port of Constanta earlier this year showed Politburo
member Emil Bobu in conversation with someone behind Ceausescu as
the president pointed to a mockup architectural project.
   For his irreverence _ not paying attention to Ceausescu _ Bobu
was air-brushed out of later published versions of the same picture.
   The Communist Party's 14th congress in November also served as a
showcase of orchestrated displays of affection for Ceausescu.
   Day after day, delegates rose to applaud and shout slogans _
``Ceauescu, Heroism, Romania, Communism'' _ as the president spoke.
They were silenced by an imperious wave of his hand.
   The suppression of dissent or complaints over years of food and
energy shortages by a powerful secret police has created an
atmosphere of fear. While most ordinarly Romanians are unwilling to
risk trouble by talking bluntly to Westerners about the country and
its leader, some do take the risk.
   ``I hope that when you come back,'' one told a departing
Westerner, ``we'll be all dancing at the funeral.'' His wink left
little doubt whose funeral he was talking about.
   A joke going around Bucharest has the same theme.
   A man asks a friend why he is reading the front page of
Scinteia, the Communist Party newspaper, so intently, when everyone
knows that the paper publishes little real news.
   ``I am looking for the obituaries,'' the friend replies.
   ``But they're on a inside page.''
   ``Not the one I'm looking for.''
   There's no trace anything like that in the 10 rooms of Ceausescu
memorabilia on the top floor of the Natural History Museum, a
chilly and dark 19th-century building on Calea Victoria.
   Few people were inside one recent day. Several shabbily dressed
attendants stood by luke-warm radiators or turned lights on and off
as three Westerners moved from room to room.
   Displays alternated by theme or country, but all had the
Ceausescus as a focal point.
   A gigantic illuminated tableau showed Ceausescu and his wife
with foreign dignitaries, including Presidents Nixon, Ford and
Carter. No Soviet leaders were in it, a reflection of long-standing
strains with the Kremlin.
   Scores of paintings, carpets or tapestries depicted Ceausescu or
his wife in a variety of heroic poses _ Ceausescu holding a scepter
with the Romanian tricolor swathed across his chest, for example,
or his wife with an aura around her head, suggestive of a halo.
   Other rooms had massive granite or marble busts of the
Ceausescus, along with expensive vases, pottery, crystal, a bull
elephant's head with massive tusks and other objects described in a
museum brochure as gifts.
   In display cases were medals on velvet pillows, including
Britain's Order of the Garter bestowed by Queen Elizabeth II in the
1970s, when Western nations praised Ceausescu's relative
indepedendence of Moscow and ignored his country's poor human
rights record.
   The medals and orders were ``bestowed on him ... as a sign of
our people's love and gratitude for its most loved son and the
Romanian president's deep respect and highest regard he enjoys all
over the world,'' said the brochure.
   In a prominent place was a certificate attesting that Mrs.
Ceausescu was an honorary citizen of Texas, along with one
bestowing the same honors on her husband from civic officials of
Fresno, Calif.

   Before the Palo Verde nuclear plant was licensed
in 1985, the U.S. nuclear industry built 92 reactors, each one
different and needing to go through the detailed, time-consuming
and costly scrutiny of regulators.
   Palo Verde was the first of what was hoped would be a
standardized design that utilities could, in effect, order from a
catalog. That ``cookie cutter'' approach is used by the French and
Japanese nuclear industries.
   Palo Verde still is a ``state-of-the-art facility,'' said NRC
regional spokesman Gregory N. Cook. ``The plant was built by people
who did a superb job. But management did not convert the
organization to the kind of staff, the kind of organization you
need to operate a nuclear plant in today's environment.''
   As a result, the $9.3 billion plant has been plagued by problems
that earned it a ranking as the nation's 19th worst and worst in
terms of management from Public Citizen, a watchdog group. In
addition, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has fined the Arizona
Nuclear Power Project $810,000 since 1983 for deficiencies in the
plant ANPP operates, and sent a special diagnostic team last month.
And an industry accreditation board put nine out of 10 training
programs on probation in June.
   ``Palo Verde 1 has fallen to the bottom of the industry,'' Joan
Claybrook, president of the Critical Mass Energy Project of Public
Citizen, a Ralph Nader-founded group, said in May. ``It's time they
closed that nuclear lemon down.''
   Problems have shut down the three reactors almost as often as
they've been running and two units have been down since early
March, forcing the consortium of utilities that own it to buy power
elsewhere during a record-length heat wave to serve their 4 million
customers in four states.
   ``The mentality of building and the mentality of operating are
two totally distinctive things,'' William F. Conway, who was lured
away from Florida Power and Light Co. in May to oversee Palo Verde,
said in June. ``It is almost like reading two different prayer
books. Operations is another type of religion.''
   According to Arizona Corporation Commission records, Unit 1 was
in operation 62 percent of the time in 1986, 49 percent in 1987, 62
percent in 1988 and 22 percent in 1989 _ not at all since early in
March. Unit 2, which came on line in late 1986, was producing power
77 percent of the time in 1987, 63 percent in 1988, and less than
half of 1989. Unit 3, the newest reactor, was up for 95 percent of
1988, producing more power than any unit in the world. But it has
been on line only 16 percent of 1989 _ not at all since early March.
   The 1,270-megawatt, pressurized-water plant's units have missed
a total of 639 days of operation this year. Scheduled refueling and
various mechanical problems have kept units 1 and 3 down since
early March, and Unit 2 has been up and down since February.
   The NRC fines include $250,000 in September for 13 alleged
violations discovered after Unit 3 shut itself down in March. So
many things went wrong during the automatic shutdown the NRC
ordered a special inspection.
   The shutdown occurred because of a power-line failure. Ensuing
problems included loss of power to two primary coolant pumps,
failure of a fast-transfer system, relief valves that froze and
wouldn't release steam on the non-nuclear side of the plant, and
loss of some radiation monitors and emergency lights.
   The NRC said in April that equipment failures leading to the
shutdown could have been avoided if problems were fixed when they
were found, some as long as four years ago: ``This event is
symptomatic of management's failure to set a standard which demands
that plant problems be recognized and fixed.''
   The agency also has complained that top managers didn't visit
critical areas often enough, a problem that is being addressed,
Cook said. ``They have developed a formal program of getting
management on site and into the plant, but as of a couple of months
ago the plan hadn't been fully implemented. We were a little
disappointed that it hadn't gotten farther along.''
   Evaluations like the one begun last month, he said, are
conducted when ``NRC senior management has substantial questions
about the overall management of the operation. ... We are looking
toward performance _ what works and what doesn't.'' The team's
report report is due in about March.
   Other fines were $250,000 in December 1988 over operation and
radiation; $100,000 in April 1988 over engineering and operation;
$100,000 in May 1986 for security problems; $50,000 in October 1985
for deficiencies in monitoring; and $60,000 in 1983 for lapses in
quality assurance and record-keeping. That's ``a fairly poor
enforcement record'' and ``very high'' fines, Cook said.
   The criteria for Public Citizen's ratings included such things
as forced shutdowns, worker exposure to radiation, violation of NRC
regulations, cost of maintenance and scores on annual NRC
assessments.
   Conway has set in motion a plan for immediate improvements at
Palo Verde, said plant spokesman Don Andrews. He brought in new
people to raise the level of management experience; began improving
accident investigation; issued a set of ``standards and
expectations'' for all employees; and moved to ``increase the sense
of urgency'' in responding to problems uncovered by the NRC.
   The National Academy for Nuclear Training, which cited lack of
attendance among problems when it put plant programs on probation,
restored accreditation in October. Only radiation protection
training had been deemed adequate.
   The NRC has been encouraged by what has happened since Conway
took over, Cook said. ``You have to expect in dealing with an
organization of that size where there have been institutional
problems, which certainly there have been, it is going to take time
to turn it around.''
   In its annual assessment Nov. 24, the NRC found overall
performance to be ``satisfactory,'' and ``directed toward safe
facility operation.'' Performance slipped somewhat in the first six
months of the reporting period ending Oct. 31 but showed
improvement in the remaining six months, the assessment said.
   NRC Regional Administrator J.M. Martin, in a letter accompanying
the report, said he expected plant performance to continue
improving if management implements planned improvements and
corrections. But he cited several areas of ``continued weakness,''
such as engineering, quality assurance and other
``problem-finding'' functions.
   ``The sign of a healthy organization is that they find their own
problems,'' he said. ``They don't wait for them to be
self-revealed, or for them to be found by regulators. What I'm
particularly looking for is that they're finding the bulk of their
problems. They aren't doing that yet.''
   Conway said the NRC report was ``right on target,'' and that he
is generally pleased with the progress at Palo Verde. ``I'm
relatively impatient by nature. I would like for us to be moving
faster,'' he said. ``But I am generally satisfied with where we're
going at this point in time.''

<HEAD>TNT Airs Cable Version of `Dinner at Eight'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Long before producers routinely scoured
newspapers for tragedies suitable for bad TV movies, there was a
thing called imagination. That once led to a a fine 1932 Broadway
play, ``Dinner at Eight.''
   Tonight, Ted Turner's TNT cable network is showing an elegant TV
version of that comedy-drama _ last made into a movie in 1933 _ by
George S. Kaufman and Edna Ferber, good writers who wrote a total
of six plays together.
   This ``Dinner,'' like the original, remains a comedy and tragedy
of manners, a series of vignettes about various folks, most rich or
formerly rich, coping with life while gearing up for a black-tie
dinner at a Manhattan townhouse.
   With a fine cast that includes Marsha Mason as the hostess, John
Mahoney as her husband, and Lauren Bacall as his old flame, this
edition is very much updated, with references to Pee Wee Herman,
Madonna, PBS and arbitrage.
   There also is a subplot about a hostile takeover of the ailing
husband's failing shipping company that his family has owned since
1873.
   Even the art of fashionable dining gets a contemporary line that
is tossed at the society hostess, a persistent giver of fashionable
dinners: `You people are like McDonald's for rich folks.''
   Sad to say, Tom Griffin's teleplay is only half good. That half
is the show's first half. There, you hear echoes of Kaufman's
acerbic wit, and that's welcome, even though the sting of the humor
tends to be softened by Ron Lagomarsino's direction.
   Alas, the second half takes on a bleak, humorless tone and
dwells far too much on a coked-out, alcoholic and over-the-hill TV
star (Harry Hamlin) who is the secret lover of Mason's engaged
daughter (Stacy Edwards).
   It may give a chance for Hamlin, from NBC's ``L.A. Law,'' to
strut his thespic stuff. But it only tends to lower the show to the
level of a routine TV drama about an actor suffering the twin
horrors of cocaine addiction and no TV series.
   And a fight between an oafish, rapicious Texas tycoon (Charles
Durning) and his dense, social-climbing young wife (Ellen Greene)
doesn't improve matters, either. It's merely nasty, nothing more.
   All this makes the earlier fun take a powder, just like Hamlin's
faded star. Those who expect Kaufman-like wit in this part of
``Dinner'' will feel like the guy who bought a pumpkin farm, then
learned Halloween is canceled.
   But let us count our blessing, even though we may be no good at
fractions.
   The chief blessing is Bacall, who in her youth was directed on
stage by Kaufman. She just about steals the show's good first half
as a breezy, sophisticated, dried-up novelist who is financially
tapped out and reduced to talk shows to remain known, but refuses
to cry the blues.
   When she blows into town and is asked by her old flame what tore
her away from her old European haunts, she just laughs. ``Haunts,
indeed. Everywhere you turn, it's Robin Leach and some anorexic.''
   Bacall tosses off this and other lines beautifully, with Mahoney
nicely underplaying things as her still-affectionate former beau.
   Greene, in a low-I.Q. part similar to the one she played as a
blonde in off-Broadway's ``Little Shop of Horrors,'' also does a
nice turn early on as the low-born lady who leaps at the chance to
meet people with ``historic manners.''
   It's too bad that the makers of this updated ``Dinner'' didn't
fully keep the spirit of its yesteryear _ taking serious things
lightly and light things seriously.
   But at least their effort gives you a few moments of wit, and,
thanks to Bacall, a classy reminder of how they did it in the old
days.

<HEAD>More Taxpayer Bailouts Coming</HEAD>

   The multibillion-dollar savings and loan
disaster is far from the only federal credit fiasco that has
occurred in the past few years, and more are likely to come,
according to a Reagan administration official.
   ``More bad news is on the way,'' said Ronald Utt in an article
written for today's Roll Call, a privately owned newspaper
circulated among members of Congress and influential government
officials.
   Utt, now a fellow in political economy at the Heritage
Foundation, a conservative think tank, suggests it is only the
sheer size of the savings and loan bailout that draws attention
from other debacles.
   Current estimates are that the cost of refinancing the savings
and loan system will require $159 billion over 10 years, but
various critics have suggestd much higher figures.
   The first of the series of other collapses involved the Farm
Credit System, whose lending practices helped create an
unsustainable speculative boom in farm prices in the 1970s.
Restructuring the system cost several billion dollars.
   The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. went next, at what
Utt claims will be an ultimate cost of hundreds of billions of
dollars. Then the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. lost more than $4
billion last year.
   The latest was revealed in September, when the General
Accounting Office reported that the Federal Housing Administration
had lost $4.2 billion in 1988, wiping out its reserves to support
$303 billion of insurance in force.
   Utt, former deputy director of the White House Office of
Management and Budget, said additional losses should be expected
because of the vast array of government lending programs, insurance
schemes and loan guarantees.
   ``Many of these programs suffer from high default rates, minimal
reserves, lax management and persistent losses,'' he said. He cited
the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., which insures pensions of 39
million private-sector workers.
   To date, he said, the PBGC has suffered cumulative losses
amounting to $4 billion, a figure he said could go higher.
   He observes that while the PBGC collects premiums, holds
reserves and obligates itself to cover failed systems, it has no
measure of the extent of liability for the trillions of dollars of
systems it has agreed to insure.
   Moreover, he continues, a recent inspector general report
accused the corporation of a variety of aministrative and
supervisory failings ``that jepoardize the fund, the taxpaper and
the pensioners.''
   Utt claims government-sponsored enterprises _ privately owned
lending institutions created by government to pursue public
purposes _ collectively expose the government to about $700 billion
in risk.
   He said some of these enterprises already are in trouble. One,
the Federal National Mortgage Association, has a little more than
$1 billion to support a mortgage portfolio of $95 billion and $140
billion in mortgage-backed paper.
   ``If FNMA were subject to the standards of solvency required of
a savings and loan, it would have been taken over by federal
regulators years ago,'' he said.
   Utt expressed the view that other taxpayer bailouts of unknown
magnitude, perhaps involving the Federal Housing Administration and
the Veterans Administration, might occur if property values fall
and default rates rise.

   American-born Australian Johnny Diesel may
prefer Vegimite to peanut butter, but his brand of rock 'n' roll
sounds like it comes fresh from the U.S. heartland, not the Aussie
bushland.
   ``The roots of our music are the '50s and '60s ... what was
happening in rock 'n' roll, R&amp;B and Motown,'' Diesel said in a
recent telephone interview from Australia. ``It's a huge
influence.''
   Refreshingly low-tech, Johnny Diesel &amp; The Injectors mix good
ol' American rock and blues with forceful guitar attacks honed in
the geographic isolation of Perth in Western Australia.
   Musically mature beyond his 23 years, Diesel pleads guilty to
fanning embers of the American rock 'n' roll fireball blown
worldwide three decades ago. ``We're bound to sound American,
because that's where the blues began,'' he said.
   The band cut their well-received debut album, ``Johnny Diesel &amp;
The Injectors'' (Chrysalis), at an unknown studio in Memphis,
Tenn., not Melbourne, Australia. They relied on veteran hard rock
producer Terry Manning to give them just enough rope, Diesel said.
   Backed-up by a vocal saxophone, reliable bass and punchy drums,
Diesel attracted an international mix to match his own far-flung
origins: French-born Australian Bernie Bremond on saxophone;
Anglo-Australian drummer Yak Sherrit; and native Aussie Johnny
Dalzell on bass.
   Their name is derived from the mumbled, automotive double
entendres of a New Zealand Maori friend. And even it hearkens back
to the hard-driving innocence of American rock music in its infancy.
   ``It's still got some rough edges there _ more than rough edges
really,'' Diesel concedes. ``We like rockin' but we can also be
very tender.''
   Their message is aimed at listeners' emotions, not their
brainpower or political bent, he says. ``The basic ingredient is
the accessibility of the music. I want to give people goosebumps; I
don't want to get inside their brain and start kicking around, or
get on a pedestal and start waving a big stick.''
   Judiciously sharing the solo spotlight with Bremond, Diesel
maintains command with lightning-bolt guitar licks that could
jump-start a Frankenstein monster. And he dispenses original song
lyrics with a clear, rangy voice tinged at times with mainstream
rock influences and at others sounding a bit like Marlon Brando's
deranged colonel in ``Apocalypse Now.''
   But he isn't afraid to calm down, take a step back and turn
soulful.
   ``Listening to the album, on some tracks we sound like a bunch
of angry little brats, and in other songs we sound sort of like
40-year-old, mellowed-out Memphis musicians,'' he said.
   Born Mark Lisotte to American parents, Diesel traveled with his
family of nine in a Volkswagen van to and from his father's
itinerate sax gigs around the northeastern United States before
they packed up and headed down under when he was 9.
   A huge hit at home and popular in Europe, he made new waves in
the United States with American critics who likened him to John
Cougar Mellencamp and Bruce Springsteen.
   But to make it with American audiences, Diesel will have to keep
touring here. He recently concluded a North American-European jaunt
that featured stops in Canada, Washington, Chicago and familiar
haunts in Texas.
   ``We just kind of roll along, soaking up influences as we go
along like a sponge,'' he said. ``Europe is great and we loving
playing at home, but we really fell for Texas, which is kind of
like Western Australia _ hot, dry and flat.''
   Through nightclub smoke he might be mistaken for a youthful
James Dean _ with his ripped T-shirt and crew-cut look, and his
matinee-idol good looks may help draw an American audience to his
Midwestern style. Yet he doesn't want to lose touch with the basic
rock roots he reveres, styles that include B.B. King and Buddy
Holly.
   ``We've done gigs with bands whose wardrobe cases were bigger
than anything else they had with them. I couldn't see the point in
that,'' he said. ``Our image is who we are, not what we wear. And a
guitar is the ultimate accessory you could ever put on. You don't
need anything else.''
   A sophomore album is scheduled for the spring, but Diesel is
sure his hoped-for U.S. success won't be founded on studio work. A
pro by age 15, he has played countless gigs in nameless Australian
venues, and plans to continue traveling. ``I think touring is a
great thing, the only thing _ no matter who you're playing to.''
   Perth is by no means a small city, with a population topping
800,000. Still, Diesel calls it the most remote city in the world.
``The closest things to it are Africa and Asia, but it's nurtured a
lot of good bands,'' he said.
   But that isolation has its advantages, too, partly allowing the
band to build and retain some element of purity.
   ``We've been left to our own devices,'' Diesel said. ``No one
has ever told us what to do, what to where or what to look like.''

   The mood of Wall Street's stock market
forecasters is distinctly downbeat as they look ahead to 1990.
   That's pretty unusual in an industry known for diehard optimism.
Some observers suggest it may be influenced by the depressed state
of the securities business as much as by the behavior of stock
prices, which still stand near record highs.
   Whatever the source of the seers' misgivings, it strikes one
group of observers as a healthy rather than a troublesome sign.
   These followers of the doctrine of ``contrary opinion'' believe
that the more wary the mood, the better are the market's chances to
do well.
   Richard Hoey, chief economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,
says his November survey of 171 managers and analysts at investing
institutions turned up the lowest enthusiasm for the stock market
outlook since he began conducting his periodic ``decision-makers
poll'' in 1983.
   Just 11.1 percent of the respondents said they expected stocks
three months hence to be in a bull market, while 52.1 percent
forecast a bear market and 36.8 percent said they were looking for
a ``neutral atmosphere.''
   In addition, Hoey reported, ``there was a dramatic rise in the
consensus probability of a stock market crash in the U.S. in the
next two years, to 42.5 percent from 26.6 percent in August.''
   By contrast, Hoey's respondents were emphatically bullish about
the chances for higher bond prices (and thus lower long-term
interest rates), with bulls outnumbering bears by better than
4-to-1.
   Investors Intelligence of New Rochelle, N.Y., finds no such
extremes in its weekly survey of 130 independent advisory services
on the stock market.
   But its late-November tally of 46.2 bulls, 34.5 percent bears
and 19.3 percent in the camp looking for a ``correction,'' or
short-term pullback, hardly qualifies as a ringing note of optimism.
   Given the background of a seven-year bull market that has
brought bountiful rewards to people who owned just about any
category of financial investment, why so much doubt?
   For one thing, some analysts say, the economy is slowing, and so
has the expansion of money and credit that helped fuel the
investment boom in the 1980s.
   ``Slower money and credit growth would suggest that investors
will have to grapple with the question of how to invest in a lower
growth economy,'' Charles Clough, chief investment strategist at
Merrill Lynch, said in the firm's annual appraisal of the outlook.
   ``After a decade of dynamic investment returns in the financial
markets, investors are likely to find that, in a lower growth
economy, annual returns from bonds, stocks and especially money
market instruments are likely to be of far more modest
proportions,'' he added.
   In the 1990s, Clough suggests, money may tend to find a home in
business projects that increase productivity ``rather than in real
estate or financial assets.''
   ``This is a two-edged sword for the financial markets. It makes
for a more productive economy, but it also leads to a drain of
liquidity from financial assets,'' he said.
   Confirmed ``contrarians,'' however, may be undaunted by all
these seemingly negative numbers and words. They believe,
essentially, that gloom works to build a store of untapped future
demand for stocks, while euphoria exhausts investors' buying power.
   Hoey noted that his survey has no record of predicting major
bear markets, since no such prolonged decline has occurred since he
started the poll seven years ago.
   But he observes, ``the stock sentiment survey has been a very
useful contrary opinion indicator when it has hit extreme levels.''
   In August 1987, he noted, bullish sentiment reached 57.2 percent
_ just before the slide that culminated in the Oct. 19 Black Monday
crash.
   In January 1988, when the market was just beginning to launch a
powerful recovery from the crash, the ranks of the bulls had
thinned to 12.4 percent.

   The 1988 drought relief program paid millions of
dollars to farmers across the country whose only claims to disaster
were normal bouts with the perils of nature. One reason the program
was applied so broadly, The Associated Press found, was the very
structure of the payment system. The second story in a four-part
series, ``Cashing In on the Drought,'' explains how farmers
allocated taxpayer dollars to their neighbors.

   R.B. Reynolds decides how to spend
millions of federal agriculture dollars each year. He implements
federal policy and sometimes hires or fires a government worker.
   Reynolds, however, is neither federal bureaucrat nor politician,
but a wheat and corn farmer here in wind-swept Hartley County.
   He was elected by his Texas Panhandle neighbors to be chairman
of the three-member committee that runs Hartley County's office of
the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service.
   Every U.S. county with some agriculture has a three-farmer
committee elected by fellow farmers to direct the local office of
the ASCS, which runs all the multibillion-dollar federal
agriculture payment programs.
   It's a job considered unique among government aid programs, with
the very recipients of federal dollars deciding who gets how many.
   Potential problems and conflicts are obvious: Would welfare
mothers determine their friends' monthly checks or students decide
roommates' eligibility for loans? But agriculture officials believe
the elected committee members are in the best position to assess
fairly the losses suffered by their neighbors _ and to keep them
honest.
   ``We have to follow the rules that come down, but we try to
represent the farmer and his needs and what would be best for
him,'' Reynolds said. ``If you don't represent the farmer, who's
going to?''
   The question of who to protect, the farmer or the government, is
at times a difficult one for conscientious committee members. One
day after Reynolds sided with farmers in an interview, he told a
reporter he preferred to say committee members have to represent
both sides and ``mediate to try to work something out.''
   Most committee members interviewed for an Associated Press study
of the 1988 drought relief effort said they voted for the good of
their neighbors whenever possible.
   ``I would say you're representing the farmer _ maybe that's not
the way it's supposed to be,'' said Mike Bouris, chairman of the
Riverside, Calif., county committee.
   ``You don't want your neighbor to be mad at you because he
didn't qualify,'' said John Rigolizzo Jr., the Camden County, N.J.,
committee chairman. ``Yes, you could say he's sticking up for his
buddy and his neighbor, but when we're in this office, we're
government employees.''
   Committee members, who are paid small stipends for their
meetings, take an oath of office pledging to uphold the laws of
Congress. Agriculture Department officials say they expect the
committees to protect taxpayers as well as be fair to farmers.
   ``They represent both, but they have rules and regulations they
have to obey,'' Dan Shaw, the ASCS deputy administrator in charge
of state and county operations, said from Washington, D.C.
   ``They can't just say this is a deprived area so let's take all
the money in the Treasury and throw it out here,'' Shaw said. ``We
feel peers are the people who can make the really good, accurate
decisions that need to be made.''
   Committees have great latitude in administering agriculture
programs, from establishing normal harvests to deciding if a crop
was cultivated properly. They must sometimes analyze farmers'
financial standings and sort through corporations, partnerships and
trusts. They also have to interpret an array of laws and
regulations.
   ``Some guidelines leave a lot for us to interpret. The smart
people can read that and find ways to get around it,'' said Don
Gronewald, a hay farmer who is member of the Kaufman County, Texas,
committee.
   ``All of the programs are good programs, and when they put them
out they had good intentions. But you're going to find somebody
abusing and using the program to their benefit, and that makes it
harder for the honest Joe,'' Gronewald said.
   Agriculture experts say farming in America is so vast that the
local committee system is the only fair way to administer the aid
programs.
   ``There are these glitches. Two counties end up rendering two
different decisions,'' said Bob Bergland, agriculture secretary
under former President Carter. ``But you have to have room for
local judgment. I'd say it works better than almost any other
scheme you can think of.''
   In the case of the drought program, many committees had to set
crop yields and estimate how much would have been harvested in a
normal year, as well as decide if a farmer kept his crop properly
fertilized, weeded and, if possible, watered.
   And the committees of three had to decide whether each applicant
farmer was eligible.
   In some cases, a county committee was more gracious with its
constituents than either insurance companies evaluating the same
losses or committees in neighboring counties interpreting the same
regulations, the AP found.
   A crop insurance company balked at paying one Oklahoma farmer an
irrigated yield of 69 bushels per acre on his damaged milo because
he had watered just once. Insurance paid only the dryland yield of
28 bushels. But the county committee granted drought relief based
on the irrigated 69-bushel yield. The farmer received $4,467.
   ``The committee made a determination that it was watered,'' said
David F. Barnes Jr., director of the Texas County, Okla., ASCS
office.
   The Chaves County, N.M., committee decided to pay a farmer
$18,285 for cotton damage caused by ``cold, rainy weather'' and
``high winds,'' although the bill contained provision for neither
freeze-like damage nor wind damage.
   The drought relief program was particularly troublesome for some
committees because it was set up with such haste, officials said.
Some farmers harvested their crops before applying for aid, making
losses difficult to verify.
   In Gaines County, Texas, ASCS director John Wayne Hall said he
struggled with 1988 claims for lost winter wheat _ a crop planted
in 1987 and cut months before Congress even considered the drought
legislation.
   ``How can I know what kind of product that boy had out there? It
was long gone,'' Hall said. ``In '88, we made a lot of judgments.''
   A recent General Accounting Office report noted that the 1988
relief program was hard to administer because it required county
officials to determine, on short notice, payments on close to 500
crops, from almonds to zucchini. The officials had little
experience or data on most of those crops.
   ``The program happened awful fast,'' said Steve Verrill,
committee chairman in Middlesex County, Mass. ``It was the disaster
in the Midwest and everybody, including the politicians, were
talking it up and they were in an awful hurry to get the money
out.''
   Both the elected farmers and the county directors they hire say
the pressure from farmers _ even in more normal years _ can be
intense.
   ``If I give everybody what they want, I can get along,'' said
Hall. ``If I say `Hey, the regulations say you can't do that,' it
makes 'em mad.''
   Hall sometimes makes 'em mad anyway.
   ``As long as they (the government) pay me, I'll enforce it,'' he
said.

   Susy Thomas is closer than ever to realizing a
dream she has held through five children and 11 years of training
that involved 40-mile commutes to class.
   The 37-year-old member of the Navajo tribe near Tohatchi, N.M.,
wants to join the small number of Navajos trained to teach in U.S.
schools.
   ``I want to teach elementary education because among Native
Americans, early childhood education is important,'' Mrs. Thomas
said during an interview after being named by the National Council
of Teachers of English as the group's first presidential scholar.
   ``I want to let them know they are Native Americans and they
have a big world to conquer,'' she added.
   Mrs. Thomas, of the ``Red Running into the Water People'' clan,
was awarded $1,000 to help her complete her part-time studies in
1991 at the University of New Mexico, Gallup, N.M.
   She currently is taking courses in art history and education
foundation at a university branch near home. She plans to save the
$1,000 check until the fall, when she will make her final push to
complete about 22 hours.
   The soft-spoken woman accepted the award during the council's
annual convention in Baltimore wearing a native black-and-red satin
dress, silver-chain belt and boots. Standing on stage with her were
14 youngsters from the Chuska School, where she is a speech therapy
assistant.
   Chuska School is an elementary boarding school for Indian
children who live in the rugged country of the Navajo Reservation.
   The Bureau of Indian Affairs says just 41 percent of its 1,039
teachers were Indians in 1987. Chuska School Principal Helen
Zongolowicz said few Indians are trained to teach in U.S. schools
mainly because of the small size of the minority group and the high
dropout rate.
   Among Navajos, the dropout rate in elementary and secondary
school is about 30 percent, with a higher percentage for college
students.
   ``My husband is very supportive of the idea of my getting my
degree and going into teaching,'' said Mrs. Thomas. ``He's a
counselor himself, working with children in kindergarten through
the third grade. These are the years to really work with them, get
them to use their mind and set their goals. Their minds are very
delicate.''
   When she was an elementary student, Mrs. Thomas recalled, ``We
were punished if we were caught talking in Navajo.'' She said many
of her friends eventually dropped out because of the negative
attitudes about language and Indian culture.
   Mrs. Thomas said she refused to give up because ``I was the
oldest in the family. I gave some of what I learned to my younger
brothers, and they looked up to me. My parents praised me. And I
had no choice. I had to become the interpreter for the family.''
   The idea of teaching young children first came when Mrs. Thomas
was in the eighth grade and ``second- and third-grade teachers
would have us work with them.''
   To attend high school, she said, ``we traveled 50 miles one way
each day, about an hour on the bus.'' Mrs. Thomas is the first
woman in her family to complete high school. She married shortly
after graduating and focused on raising a family. Her husband
returned to school to earn a degree in counseling.
   Mrs. Thomas worked for a time as a substitute teachers' aide.
``The principal there was telling me `You should go back to school
and take classes in the evening,''' she said.
   Eventually, despite her growing family, she began working toward
an associate degree in speech pathology, shifting later to special
education, and holding jobs in that field before deciding she
wanted the broader focus of teaching language arts in the primary
grades.
   ``A lot of couples go to school together and get degrees,'' said
Mrs. Thomas, referring to younger Navajo adults. ``But it has been
a struggle, going to school, course by course, all of this time.''
   She has to travel 40 miles one way for classes on the Gallup
campus.
   A staff development course two summers ago at the Chuska School
sparked Mrs. Thomas' desire to become an elementary language arts
teacher. With its emphasis on writing and reading about topics
linked to students' own lives, a ``whole language approach'' works
well in involving Indian youngsters in school learning, she said.
   ``In the whole language approach, we use things from the
children's own environment and everyday activities at home, and we
see more achievement,'' she said.
   ``We were punished, but now it's praise and positive
reinforcement,'' she said. ``I think of all these people on the
reservation, out of school, on the street. Learning would have
meant more to them. They got lost.
   ``I know children in elementary school today will succeed. I
look at their work hanging in the hallways. It's amazing to compare
it with what our teachers had us do when I was a child.''

<HEAD>The Road Less Traveled: William Carlos Williams</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL MORAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poet Robert Frost won four Pulitzer
Prizes and the adoration of millions by traveling ``The Road Not
Taken,'' as one of his poems relates.
   But ask a poet or scholar who most influenced poetry in the 20th
century and the likely answer will be William Carlos Williams, a
physician whose clear, modernist cadence broke centuries of
convention.
   ``He was one of my strongest influences,'' said Allen Ginsberg,
the bard of the beat generation. ``He was part of a group that was
the most important thing to happen to American poetry in this
century.''
   In retrospect, Williams _ not Frost _ ``took the one less
traveled by.'' He chose medical school and private practice over
the bohemian life of his contemporaries. Indeed, scholars attribute
Williams' medical training _ his eye for picking details from the
mundane _ with distinguishing him from lesser poets.
   His books of poetry include ``Collected Poems'' and ``Pictures
From Brueghel,'' for which he won a Pulitzer in 1963. He also wrote
critical essays, plays, novels and short stories.
   His verse gained international recognition in 1913 for his
second collection, ``The Tempers.'' His contemporaries _ Gertrude
Stein, Ernest Hemingway and schoolmate Ezra Pound _ fled what they
saw as the oppressive, capitalist climate of early 20th century
America. But Williams chose to remain in the United States. In tiny
Rutherford, a rural town on a knoll rising above the empty New
Jersey meadowlands in view of the growing Manhattan skyline, he
turned his observations of common life into innovations.
   Langdon Hammer, an associate professor of English at Yale
University, said Williams' work elevated American poetry to the
forefront of the modernist movement of the early 20th century,
displacing the more formal British school.
   ``He has a status like that of Yeats or Elliot,'' said Hammer.
   Ginsberg first met Williams while working as a reporter for a
left-wing Paterson, N.J., labor paper.
   ``I cooked up some excuse to interview him because I had heard
him recite at the Museum of Modern Art,'' Ginsberg said. ``It
opened my eyes immediately. His poetry was simply an intensified
form of speech.''
   Ginsberg recalled sending Williams a letter with some poems
after the interview. The doctor sent them back, telling him to go
back to his notes to find the raw versions _ the less refined, more
natural drafts.
   Not long afterward, in 1957, Ginsberg published his classic
poem, ``Howl.''
   Williams lived in Rutherford from his birth in 1883 until his
death in 1963, treating the poor and middle-class families of
surrounding towns and the gritty mill city of Paterson about 10
miles to the north. The city would be the subject of the
five-volume epic poem ``Paterson,'' written between 1946 and 1958.
   Williams also left his mark on medicine, eventually becoming
chief of staff at Passaic General Hospital and a recognized pioneer
in pediatrics, one of the first doctors to make it his specialty.
   His son, Dr. William Eric Williams, lives and practices medicine
in the same home his grandparents purchased in the late 1880s.
Dealing with the legacy of his father, spending endless hours with
English professors and biographers, and answering the same
questions from journalists time and again, has taken a lot out of
him, he says.
   ``For 75 years I've been communicating with artists, scholars,
reporters and writers about my father,'' he said in a brief
interview. ``I can't get my own work done and I've just had to stop
giving my time away.''
   But surprisingly, in a state where the ultimate tribute may be
getting one's name on a New Jersey Turnpike reststop, Williams'
reputation has remained obscure beyond scholars and other poets.
   ``It's almost like we haven't figured out what place he holds in
our history,'' said John Dollar, a retired Fairleigh Dickinson
University professor who used to read to Williams after the poet's
vision was impaired by a stroke in the late 1950s.
   In the Rutherford Public Library, Williams' books, photographs
and paintings clutter a tiny room dedicated to the poet, but it is
locked and dark most of the time.
   Dollar and a handful of other former acquaintances and fans help
gather artifacts from the poet's life. ``We don't know quite what
to do with this room,'' Dollar said. ``I'm afraid its fallen into
disarray.''
   Williams' greatest talent was his ability to draw meaning from
common things, scholars say. Pound wrote him many times imploring
him to leave Rutherford for Europe.
   Composition on a typewriter _ considered an eccentricity and
even reviled by some critics at the time _ cultivated in Williams
an interest in the physical shape of the verse as well as its sound
and message.
   If Rutherford's image of the poet-doctor remains ill-defined,
his memory lives on in the William Carlos Williams Center for
Performing Arts, opened a decade ago in the abandoned Tivoli
Theatre building. But the man who worked so hard for the poor and
infirm has won little wide acclaim.
   ``They never understood him really,'' said Dollar. ``I believe
it was one of the things that truly bothered him. The (Fairleigh
Dickinson) University never gave him an honorary degree, although
he spoke there often. They never recognized what they had right
under their noses.''

<HEAD>Hollywood Recreating `Secret War' in Laos</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENIS D. GRAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MAE HONG SON, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A crippled C-123 lies on an
airstrip flanked by sandbagged bunkers, stacks of ammunition and
men in fatigues. Nearby, a field of colorful opium poppies can be
seen swaying in the breeze.
   Flying into this remote town ringed by jungled mountains seems
an eerie descent into the Indochina War _ and two decades back in
time.
   On closer inspection, however, the howitzer shells prove to be
of wood, the crashed military transport is a hollow fake and
110,000 silk and polyester flowers make up the field of deadly
``opium.''
   And the blue-eyed macho type running out of a fly-blown bar that
has just been skewered by a hunk of exploding airplane wing happens
to be actor Mel Gibson.
   Welcome to ``Air America,'' Hollywood's recreation of the
mayhem, political machinations and hell-raising known as ``the
secret war'' in Laos.
   In real life, Air America was an outfit owned by the Central
Intelligence Agency. In Laos, it supported the Vientiane government
and an army of CIA-paid Hmong tribals who battled the communist
Pathet Lao and their North Vietnamese allies.
   Grizzled veterans of past conflicts, and retired military pilots
from the war in neighboring Vietnam flew for this secret shuttle
service. They carried guerrillas, refugees, rice, ammunition and _
most controversially _ opium.
   The pilots were variously described as mercenaries, patriots and
``the finest bunch of airplane drivers that has ever been got
together anywhere.'' They flew _ and sometimes died _ by the motto,
``Anything, Anywhere, Anytime.''
   The film focuses on the relationship between two pilots, played
by Gibson and Robert Downey Jr., as they fight, drink and womanize
in a bizarre war that officially doesn't exist.
   ``We're not here so what you and I just saw didn't happen,'' an
obnoxious CIA man lectures Gibson who has vainly tried to rescue a
fellow pilot, Charlie, from a burning plane. Moments earlier the
film shows President Nixon announcing on television that the United
States was not militarily involved in Laos.
   ``It may not have happened to you, and it may not have happened
to Nixon, but it sure as hell happened to Charlie,'' Gibson snaps
back.
   Director Roger Spottiswoode said he hopes the finished product
will work both as an adventure film featuring aerial stunts and
darkish humor and one with some political undertones.
   Gibson plays an outwardly cynical veteran flier ``who has made
his uneasy peace with a world he knows is corrupt,'' the director
said. Downey portrays a younger man fresh out of Los Angeles (where
he had his helicopter license yanked) who balks at compromise and
rebels when he discovers he has been ferrying opium.
   Some Air America veterans have grumbled to the producers that
they would be depicted as a bunch of drug runners and that the
story of the secret war would be distorted. The CIA has had made no
comment.
   While an earlier, discarded script reportedly was studded with
black humor and sharp slants on the war, the political guts were
torn out of the final script and the pilots are portrayed as
heroes. The final version goes lightly on the official American
conduct of the war in Laos, which included extensive secret
bombing, a string of lies and the CIA's helping hand in the
marketing of opium for its hill-tribe allies.
   A great deal of effort, however, has gone into recapturing the
look and atmosphere of 1971 Laos.
   The filmmakers relied in part on the book ``Air America,'' by
Christopher Robbins, as well as archival material and interviews
with Indochina war veterans, some of whom have settled in Thailand
and took small parts in the film.
   Marhsaled for the movie was a force of 26 aircraft, some 1,700
crew and extras and a budget of $35 million.
   ``It gives one more respect for Dwight D. Eisenhower when he
launched D-Day,'' said producer Daniel Melnick, stalking the set
wearing a cap emblazoned with three stars and ``Maj. Gen. Melnick.''
   Northern Thailand was chosen for more than two months of
location shooting because of its close resemblence to neighboring
Laos. Some of the same tribal groups live on both sides of the
border and opium, from which heroin is refined, is still grown in
both countries.
   Award-winning production designer Allan Cameron dressed up
sections of Chiang Mai, the major city of northern Thailand, to
resemble the Laotian capital of Vientiane. Real bar girls were
brought up from Bangkok to the recreated White Rose, a pilot
hangout in Vientiane where the sexual acrobatics were as madcap as
the aerial ones.
   Mae Hong Son proved strikingly similar to Long Tieng, a
sprawling CIA-run base dubbed ``Spook Heaven'' by journalists that
mushroomed into the second largest city in Laos.
   Three hangars, a hospital, warehouse and operations center were
built at Mae Hong Son's once sleepy airport with the Thai military
providing the aircraft and extra pilots.
   As Downey arrives from the United States, a baseball bat slung
over his shoulder, Spottiswoode tries to capture the frenetic
activity of what was at the height of the war one of the busiest
airports in the world. A damaged light aircraft dangles by a cable
from a big Sikorsky helicopter while a C-123 taxies, a light
observation helicopter descends and medics rush a wounded Air
America pilot from a Huey chopper.
   A few hundred yards away Gibson slings a wounded refugee over
his shoulder and flees Pathet Lao troops who have burst into a
squalid refugee camp. A small charge set below dirt and coconut
husks bursts just ahead of him, and the take ends.
   The star of ``Lethal Weapon,'' ``Road Warrior'' and
``Gallipoli'' whips off his shirt, hands it to an assistant and
swings his naked torso into a waiting Mercedes Benz.
   Time for a lunch break from the secret war.

<HEAD>Pentagon Budget Cuts: Local Pain But National Gain Foreseen</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense employs one in every three scientists
and engineers and a fifth of the country's manufacturing workers,
so Washington's new worry is whether slashing the military budget
could lead to wrenching readjustments in the economy.
   This time most of the experts are optimistic. Except for
localized repercussions in one-industry towns, the plowshare
prospects raised by President Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev in the
stormy seas off Malta promise mostly benefits, they say.
   Still, some analysts are worried about local depressions and
whether managers can adopt to civilian production at a time of
extreme import competition.
   ``I'd like to see the government come up with a plan to help
people in a graceful and humane way, but you talk about an
industrial policy in this country and they call you a communist,''
says Lawrence J. Korb, who served in the Reagan administration as
an assistant defense secretary.
   Congress' Joint Economic Committee is concerned enough to have
called hearings this week and next on ``the economic consequences
of reduced defense spending and the winding down of the Cold War.''
   There is not much dispute that military spending is heading in
only one direction: down. Defense Secretary Richard Cheney has told
his service chiefs to list programs that can be slowed or
jettisoned.
   Former Rand Corp. executive William W. Kaufmann, now at Harvard
and the Brookings Institution, says that if the U.S.-Soviet
relationship continues to blossom the defense budget can shrink by
half in 10 years.
   ``Virtually no one thinks the defense budget will not fall,''
says Gordon Adams, director of the Defense Budget Project, a
Washington research outfit.
   ``Everyone is pretty well convinced that it is going to be, at
best, flat,'' agrees John Ruby, chief operating officer of Ford
Aerospace, the weaponry arm of Ford Motor Co. ``There'll probably
be fewer ships, planes and tanks built.''
   One scenario said to have been floated by Cheney himself calls
for trimming previous estimates of Pentagon spending _ which some
consider intentionally padded _ by $180 billion over five years,
with most coming in the last two years. This year's Pentagon
spending amounts to $300 billion.
   ``Depending on its size and speed, a substantial cut in defense
spending phased in over a number of years could be one of the best
things that could happen to the economy,'' says Charles Schultze,
who was President Carter's chief economic adviser. ``One thing this
country does not have is a surplus of skilled engineers and skilled
workmen.''
   Still, when the machines of war are complex electronic systems,
the task of converting plants and jobs to a civilian economy isn't
as easy as it was after World War II, when Detroit shifted smoothly
from making tanks to making Buicks.
   No civilian market exists for stealth aircraft or Sidewinder
missiles. And managers used to the hothouse environment of Pentagon
contracting _ with no competition from overseas, a single,
cooperative customer and cost-plus-profit accounting _ may have
trouble adjusting to marketplace realities.
   ``Defense contractors are used to being told what the market
is,'' says consultant Jacques Gansler, author of ``Affording
Defense'' and a Pentagon procurement official in 1972-77. ``The
commercial world isn't like that.''
   He says long-term planning is required: ``If you start to plan
when you get your notice to close the plant, you're in trouble.''
   Seymour Melman, retired professor of industrial engineering at
Columbia University and a pioneer advocate of planned conversion,
strongly disagrees with those who say the economy can absorb
military budget cuts without severe dislocations.
   He argues that to smooth the transition an elaborate government
retraining and readjustment program will be required.
   No planning can mean a crisis for defense industry workers,
Melman says.
   ``What are they going to work at?'' he asks. ``Making shoes?
Eighty-five percent of our shoes are imported. Consumer
electronics? All imported. Machine tools? Half are imported.''
   Moreover, Melman argues, defense managers are equally incapable
of making the leap to the civilian economy without retraining.
Putting them in the private economy with the habits acquired in a
lifetime of doing business only with the Pentagon would invite
disaster, he says.
   To make his point, he cites the ``technological chauvinism''
that led aerospace engineers to design elaborate trolley cars for
the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority which repeatedly broke down.
   ``No major military-serving enterprise has demonstrated an
autonomous ability to carry out the sort of occupational switch
that is needed to go civilian,'' Melman wrote in his book,
``Profits Without Production.''
   ``If you unleash these people, the U.S. will turn into a
third-rate economy,'' Melman says. ``They can't hack it. We will
lose the capability of repairing the damage.''
   But economist Sar Levitan of George Washington University says
the American economy will create demand for the goods and services
laid-off defense workers can provide.
   ``We have found in the last few years that human needs are
insatiable,'' he says. ``Even if everyone has a refrigerator, we
want VCRs and toys for the kids that cost hundreds of dollars. We
want more vacations and more health care. If it is an orderly
diminution in the defense establishment, then I don't think it
would be a verious serious problem.''
   But, he adds, ``If the economy is weak, Congress would be much
more resistant to any defense cuts, whether we need the weapons or
not.''
   Liberals in Congress have pushed for years for ``conversion''
legislation to ease the transition away from big defense layouts.
   Under a version sponsored by Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., defense
contractors would be required to put 1.25 percent of receipts into
a fund to pay the costs of economic adjustment. Laid-off workers
might get 90 percent of their lost salaries while being retrained
for civilian jobs.
   Opponents see such proposals as governmental interference in the
free market.
   Says Adams: ``Counseling, retraining, job search and relocation
programs are critical; income supplements, however, slow the
adjustment process.''
   Says Melman in rebuttal: ``In other words, let the working
stiffs take a job at any pay.''
   Some defense contractors don't want to think about converting to
the civilian economy, no matter what the future levels of defense
spending.
   ``We have no plans to go to commercial accounts,'' says Pete
Connolly, spokesman for General Dynamics in St. Louis. ``There may
be fewer swords to beat into plowshares, but that's what we're
going to continue to do.''
   Gansler, senior vice president of Analytic Sciences Corp., says
defense spending cuts have only a gradual impact. Generally,
Pentagon contracts provide for prohibitive penalty payments if they
are canceled.
   ``And when you stop spending in some areas of defense, you have
to increase it in others,'' Gansler adds. ``You want to increase
your intelligence gathering and your long-term research and
development so that there are no technological surprises in store.
... I don't look for a trashing of the industry.''

<HEAD>Part I: Jesus Descended From Checkered Ancestry</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE>
<TEXT>
   This first installment of a three-part Christmas
series about the relatives of Jesus deals with his ancestral roots.

<TEXT>
   Everyone is a special sum of ancestry _ to enhance or diminish
through a lifetime. That was so for the child of Christmas, the
product of a heritage.
   Some biblical passages cloak his origins in utter mystery,
before time itself. But others accord him a thoroughly natural
family tree.
   ``He was in the beginning with God,'' says one account, a
``Word'' or ``Logos,'' a vitalizing wisdom inherent in the Creator
before the world began. Yet other passages say he was ``made like
his brethren in every respect.''
   ``Son of man,'' he usually called himself, but also ``Son of
God.''
   He combined ``universality with particularity,'' the ``divine
and human model,'' writes church historian Jaroslav Pelican in his
book ``Jesus Through the Centuries.'' It says a key question put to
him was, ``Where do you come from?''
   Although seldom noted, he had a long string of forbears as well
as contemporary relatives who gave him both problems and help. His
lineage ran deep into Jewish history.
   As with most people if their descent is traced back far enough,
he had a checkered ancestry, good and bad, the lowly and great,
kings, betrayers, heroes, adulterers, warriors and prostitutes.
   It was an odd assortment, like humanity itself, alien Gentiles
and fellow Jews, the weak and strong, upright and corrupt. The fact
that he shared these common roots is considered theologically basic
to his purpose: becoming identified with all humankind.
   They ``were all members of Jesus' family, his great-great-great
grandaddies and grandmamas in the faith,'' wrote church scholar
William H. Willimon. ``For all their weaknesses and shortcomings,
this motley but richly human crew were indeed his people.''
   Two genealogies of Jesus are recorded, one in the first chapter
of the Book of Matthew, the other in the third chapter of the Book
of Luke. They vary in some detail and some interpreters debatably
assume Luke gives the line of his mother, Mary, and that Matthew
gives that of Joseph, legally the father.
   ``It is possible that the original genealogy did interpret
Joseph as the father of Jesus, that is, that it had been formulated
before the understanding of Jesus as the divinely generated son of
God,'' writes New Testament scholar Henrikus Boers in his book
``Who Was Jesus?''
   Some progenitors are on both lists, including olden patriarchs
of Judaism and Israel's great King David, along with other lesser
figures of sundry character.
   Matthew lists 41 ancestors, starting back at the time of
Abraham, ancient father of Israel, and other early patriarchs,
Isaac and Jacob.
   Luke lists 77 progenitors in reverse order, starting with Joseph
and enumerating others going back to the first man, Adam, and
finally to his creator, God.
   Other figures out of dim antiquity also are included, such as
Noah, and that legend of longevity, Methuselah, who lived 969
years, all designated ancestors of Jesus.
   In the mostly male lists, four women are named, and they're a
mixed group _ a soldier's beautiful wife, Bathsheba, seduced by
King David; the harlot of Jericho, Rahab; the sexually maneuvering
Cananite, Tamar; and the loyal Mohabite, Ruth.
   Tamar was the daugher-in-law of Judah, son of the patriarch
Jacob. Her husband died and after prolonged widowhood, she
disguised herself as a prostitute and enticed her father-in-law to
lie with her. She bore twins, one named Perez, also among Jesus'
forbears.
   Rahab was a harlot who sheltered two scouts sent by the
Israelite warrior-leader Joshua to spy out Jericho before taking
it. She hid them from searchers in flax stalks on her rooftop.
   She later helped the pair escape, lowering them on a rope from a
window in her house, which was built into the city wall. By
agreement with the two, her clan was spared when Jericho was
destroyed, her house marked by a scarlet cord hung from a window.
   The devoted woman of Moab, Ruth, widowed by her Hebrew husband,
insisted on returning with her mother-in-law, Naomi, to Israel,
with these memorable words: ``For where you go I will go ... your
people will be my people, and your God my God.''
   On Naomi's advice, Ruth worked in the harvest, sleeping at the
feet of the owner, Boaz, thus winning him as her husband. They were
parents of Obed, father of Jesse, who fathered King David.
   His philandering with Bathsheba, the gorgeous wife of an absent
military officer, Uriah, produced sons Nathan and future King
Solomon, alternatively listed in Jesus' line of descent.
   Other men on the lists also displayed foibles, such as Jacob's
deceiving his father to gain an inheritance, and even Abraham
fearfully palming off his lovely wife, Sarah, as his ``sister'' to
placate the ruling pharaoh while temporarily in Egypt.
   Nevertheless, those honored patriarchs also displayed courage,
initiative and devotion in their covenant with God to lead a people
that would be a promised ``light to the nations.''
   The great Israelite military commander, Joshua, successor to
Moses, also is listed, along with a long succession of kings,
decent and debauched, in addition to charming, psalm-singing David
and wise Solomon, credited with the Book of Proverbs and builder of
Jerusalem's first Temple.
   Other kings include Rehoboam, whose oppressions, idolatrous
rites and immoralities stirred a revolt that divided the kingdom;
Uzziah, stricken with leprosy in a prosperous reign, and Hezekiah
who led reforms under guidance of the prophet Micah.
   Also listed is Manasseh, described as ``the most wicked king of
Judah,'' whose religious deviations included Baalism, exaltation of
the idol Astarte, wizardry and Molech worship that involved forcing
children through fire.
   Tradition has it that Manasseh had the great prophet Isaiah
sawed asunder.
   One king listed, Josiah, took the throne at age 8 when his
father, Amon, was murdered. But Josiah had a long, just reign,
ousting corrupt priests and recovering the lost ``Book of law'' in
repairing the Temple.
   Of many others named, some are clouded, uncertain figures, while
others are notable in Jewish annals, such as Judah, founder of a
main Israelite tribe, and the prophet Nathan who rebuked David for
his illicit affair.
   The mixed lot of people, with their sundry faults and strengths,
were all ``part of the promise fulfilled'' by the Christ child,
Willimon writes. They, ``for all their weaknesses, ... were
instruments of the promise.''
   On the other hand, Jesus' descent also is traced directly to the
Godhead, adding an unfathomable engima to his humanity.
   ``In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and
the Word was God,'' says the distinctively interpretative gospel of
John. ``And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, full of grace
and truth.''
   He is ``fully God and fully man,'' classic Christian doctrine
says. His conception by the virgin Mary is ascribed by the gospels
to divine intervention. St. Paul calls him the ``image of the
invisible God.''
   Jesus himself, though he was generally elusive about it and
though he identified closely with common folk, sometimes laid it
out plainly, as related by John's gospel:
   ``Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I am,'' he
said. ``I and the Father are one ... the Father is in me and I am
in the Father.''

<HEAD>Part II: The Baptizer Sees Startling Role for Kinsman Jesus</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE>
<TEXT>
   This second article in a three-part Christmas
series about relatives of Jesus deals with Elizabeth and John the
Baptist.

<TEXT>
   The shaggy, desert hermit pointed a bony finger at the
approaching newcomer and exclaimed, ``Behold, the Lamb of God, who
takes away the sin of the world!''
   That startling conclusion about Jesus came from a recluse of the
wilderness, John the Baptist. He also was a relative of Jesus,
perhaps a cousin, who apparently didn't recognize him at first.
   The ``baptizer,'' among numerous recorded kinfolk of that
special progeny of Christmas, had quit his notable family in
Jerusalem to dwell alone in the barren hills north of the Dead Sea.
   His impulsive, lofty assessment of Jesus as the redeemer of
humanity ``is the way Christians have reacted to Jesus through the
ages,'' writes New Testament scholar Henrikus Boers.
   Yet links between their differing ministries ``may promise the
fullest answer'' to the question, ``Who was Jesus?'', Boers adds in
a new book by that name, analyzing the historical basis of Jesus'
life.
   While Jesus and John effused high mutual esteem, they also
showed some touchiness about each other.
   ``Among those born of women, there has risen no one greater than
John the Baptist,'' Jesus said, calling him ``more than a prophet''
and crediting him with starting ``the good news of the kingdom of
God.''
   In according John that decisive role, Jesus ``revealed that he
understood himself to be living in a time when the kingdom of God
had already arrived,'' says Boers, of Emory University.
   John was the son of an aged Jerusalem couple in the Jewish
priestly class, Zechariah and his wife, Elizabeth. Luke's gospel
terms her a ``kinswoman'' of Mary, mother of Jesus.
   When Mary mysteriously became pregnant before her marriage to
Joseph, she hastily left her parents' home in upland Nazareth to
visit her city relatives. They, too, were in a bewildered state,
Luke relates.
   The old priest, Zechariah, had been struck dumb temporarily when
his wife, aged and presumed barren, had incredibly conceived. She
was in her sixth month and ``the babe leaped in her womb'' on
Mary's arrival.
   Elizabeth bubbled with affection, an older, city woman to her
young, country cousin, both expectant mothers. ``Blessed are you
among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb!''
   Mary exulted, ``My soul magnifies the Lord ... for he who is
mighty has done great things for me ....''
   Mary stayed three months before returning to Nazareth and
marriage to the temporarily perturbed but finally understanding
Joseph.
   About that time, Elizabeth gave birth, and Zechariah suddenly
could speak again, predicting a pivotal place for his new son,
named John.
   ``You, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High,''
going ``before the Lord to prepare his way'' and giving ``knowledge
of salvation to his people ... through the tender mercy of our
God.''
   As a young man, John withdrew into the desert, evidently not
consorting with his slightly younger kinsman, Jesus. On finally
encountering him as an adult, John says he ``did not know him.''
   But their paths crossed dramatically.
   They differed strikingly in temperament and behavior. In
contrast to Jesus' sociable disposition, mixing warmly with all
comers, John was a rigidly disciplined loner. Both were criticized.
   ``For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, `He
has a demon!''' Jesus said. ``The Son of man came eating and
drinking, and they say, `Behold, a glutton and drunkard, a friend
of tax collectors and sinners'.''
   John had dwelt alone in the desolate, mountainous wastelands
west of the Jordan, living on locusts and wild honey, absorbing the
secrets of vast silences and the stars.
   Out of that long solitude, he came down to the Jordan banks, a
bristly figure, clad in a camel pelt tied with leather thongs,
exhorting:
   ``Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.'' He raised his
arms like spiny branches toward the sky. ``Prepare the way of the
Lord.''
   He drew growing crowds, soldiers, tradespeople, rabbis, Temple
officials and others, becoming known as the ``baptizer'' from
baptizing many in the river.
   Some asked who he was. A returned prophet Elijah? The Christ?
   ``No,'' the craggy baptizer said. ``I am the voice of one crying
in the wilderness, `Make straight the way of the Lord'.''
   He added, ``I baptize you with water; but he who is mightier
than I is coming ...; he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.''
   Jesus later appeared there and John neither recognized him nor
realized their blood ties, yet spontaneously saw something else in
him, calling him ``Lamb of God'' who atones for human wrongs.
   Although protesting his unworthiness for it, John baptized
Jesus, who insisted on it.
   As he emerged dripping from the water, a heavenly glow ``like a
dove'' descended on him, the account says, and a voice sounded,
``This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.''
   Eventually, as Jesus' ministry began, agents of Galilee's King
Herod Antipas seized John the Baptist, imprisoned him in a dungeon,
and finally beheaded him at the coaxing of the king's dancing
step-daughter.
   Gospel accounts say the imprisonment resulted from John's
attacks on Herod switching wives in a bigamous marriage, but
ancient Jewish historian Josephus says John also was suspected of
inciting insurrection.
   While in prison, John had begun to wonder about Jesus' ministry
and sent followers to ask, ``Are you he who is to come or shall we
look for another?''
   Jesus responded, ``Go and tell John what you hear and see; the
blind receive their sight and the lame walk, lepers are cleansed
and the deaf hear ... and the poor have good news preached to them.
And blessed is he who takes no offense at me.''
   This hinted at possible rivalry between them, but Jesus went on
to extol the baptizer.
   While Christianity generally has minimized John as simply a
forerunner of Jesus, the record shows lingering ties between them.
John's influence lasted long afterward in many places as related by
the missionary-apostle Paul.
   Jesus, in his preaching, often referred to John, asking
challenging questions about him to stump critics. Some
contemporaries saw Jesus as John's successor, thinking Jesus was
the baptizer raised from the dead.
   Indicating the bracketing of their work, Jesus' apostles once
asked, ``Lord, teach us to pray as John taught his disciples.''
   Jesus then recited _ under pressure of John's example _ that
famous prayer known to all Christianity as the ``Lord's prayer.''
   Yet there was a poignant note as John watched his own star
fading and that of Jesus brightening. ``He must increase, but I
must decrease,'' John told his followers. Yet ``this joy of mine in
now full.''
   Grasping the ``historical solidarity between John and Jesus,''
writes New Testament scholar W.R. Farmer, ``has become an essential
first step toward an understanding of the mission and message of
Jesus.''
   The baptizer, says the fourth gospel, ``was not the light, but
came to bear witness to the light.''

<HEAD>Part III: Family in Galilee Put Pressures On Jesus</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE>
<TEXT>
   This final part of a three-part Christmas series
is about the big Galilean family of which Jesus was a part.

   Baffled and sometimes upset by Jesus' independent streak, his
family tried to curb him. ``Even his brothers did not believe
him,'' the record says. But they stuck by him, eventually becoming
pillars of his cause.
   A putative aunt sought to curry preferential status for her
sons, supposed cousins, but he wouldn't play favorites. When still
a boy of l2, he distressed his elders by quitting them to converse
with Temple scholars.
   ``Son, why have you treated us so?'' his mother remonstrated,
noting that she and her husband, Joseph, had hunted him for three
days. They did not understand his explanation about being drawn to
God's house.
   The push-and-pull of those closest and dearest is a common
experience in the best of families. That sort of pressure rimmed
Jesus' life _ the chafing, caring concern of relatives. He had many
in that small close-knit enclave of Israel, bound together by its
belief in one God in a pagan world.
   Relationships, near and distant, pervaded that tiny, insulated
society. It was a hemmed-off, connected household, especially in
Jesus' rural hometown of Nazareth in upland Galilee.
   ``A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and
among his own kin, and in his own house,'' he said, indicating the
negative reactions of ``kin'' to his newly launched ministry.
   He ``marveled because of their disbelief,'' Mark's gospel notes.
   His family must have been aghast when Nazareth townspeople
dragged him angrily from the synagogue after his first sermon about
liberty for captives and the oppressed and ``good news to the
poor.''
   Neighors intended to hurl him from a cliff, but stopped at the
last moment, hesitating. His gaze burned into them, and they shrank
back, opening a path for him. He walked away, never going home
again.
   He ``who loves father or mother'' or ``son or daughter more than
me is not worthy of me,'' he said, adding that his truth requires
greater devotion than to parents, wife, children, brothers, sisters
or even to one's ``own life.''
   His immediate family included a flock of ``brothers and
sisters,'' the record says, naming James, Joses, Judas and Simon,
plus an unspecified number of sisters.
   Differences exist about their exact relationship because of
Catholic belief in Mary's perpetual virginity. Some hold that the
brothers and sisters were offspring of Joseph by a previous
marriage, though this is without biblical support.
   It also has been claimed they were cousins in the loose
terminology of ancient times. In any case, a batch of them were
linked in Scripture with Joseph and Mary and obviously shared an
upbringing with Jesus.
   Scripture, in saying Jesus was Mary's ``first-born son,''
implies she later had others, and in saying Joseph ``knew her not
until she had borne a son,'' implies subsequent marital relations.
Whichever, it was a big family.
   It tried to deter Jesus' ministry at the outset. Distressed by
talk that he was ``beside himself,'' his family descended on a
synagogue where he was preaching, intending to seize him.
   When word reached him that ``your mother and your brothers are
outside, asking for you,'' the personal pain of it must have torn
him. He lowered his head momentatily, then spread his arms wide and
said:
   ``Who are my mother and my brothers?'' His gesture embraced
everyone. ``Here are my mother and my brothers! Whoever does the
will of God is my brother, and sister and mother.''
   A poignant interlude, it projected Jesus' work beyond intimate
bonds to humanity at large. But it must have hurt. Such steps are
never without pain, said the late theologian Paul Tillich.
   Noting that the ``depth of the gap'' between him and his family
became acute only with the start of his public ministry, Tillich
added:
   ``Something unconditional breaks into the conditional relations
of the natural family and creates a community which is as intimate
and strong as the family relations, and at the same time infinitely
superior to it.''
   Jesus' apparently rich aunt is identified in three of the
gospels _ John referring to ``his mother's sister,'' Mark to
``Salome'' and Matthew to the ``mother of the sons of Zebedee.''
   Zebedee ran a properous fishing fleet on the Sea of Galilee and
two of his sons, James and John, quit the business to become
disciples of Jesus, presumably also cousins. Salome evidently was
among wealthy women who supported Jesus ``out of their means.''
   That James and John were cousins is further indicated when
Jesus, on the cross, assigned care of his mother to John, a family
responsibility not likely to be placed outside blood ties.
   Salome was a strong-minded, practical woman, something of a
firebrand like her sons, whom Jesus nicknamed ``sons of thunder.''
She also was ambitious, and she saw majestic prospects for Jesus.
   While some relatives doubted his course, she felt sure of it,
even though misconstruing his goal as a restored Jewish kingdom.
She wanted some key places reserved for family.
   She put it bluntly, a senior to a younger clan member. ``Command
that these two sons of mine may sit, one at your right hand and one
at your left, in your kingdom.''
   Jesus looked fondly at his aunt and slowly shook his head. ``You
do not know what you are asking.'' It aroused jealousy among his
apostles. He told them his domain would not be run like the Roman
occupation _ by force and domination.
   Impatience also was registered by Jesus' ``brothers.'' His
growing impact in rural Galilee impressed them, John 7 notes, and
they proposed he go to Jerusalem for a coming festival to establish
himself at the heart of Judaism if he could.
   ``Leave here and go to Judea,'' they urged, suggesting somewhat
skeptically that if his works were genuine he could gain greater
fame. ``For no man works in secret if he seeks to be known openly.
If you do these things, show yourself to the world.''
   He looked at them affectionately, reading their doubts. ``My
time has not yet come, but your time is always here ... Go to the
feast yourselves.''
   Later, however, he went. Curious crowds besieged him, leading to
his crucifixion by Roman authorities, and his resurrection.
   That event transformed his brothers, binding them to him in
unwavering loyalty. The oldest brother, called James the Just,
became head of the church in Jerusalem, his leadership ranked above
the 12 apostles.
   He presided over the church's first council, which widened doors
of the new faith beyond Jews to Gentiles, to all the world. Many
scholars ascribe to him the biblical epistle of James with its call
to apply Jesus' teachings in deeds.
   ``Be doers of the word,'' he wrote. ``Faith, if it has no works,
is dead.''
   After James was slain in rising revolutionary tides of the early
A.D. 60s, church historian Eusebius says, another brother of Jesus,
Simon, took over church leadership in Jerusalem.
   Initially unresponsive, relatives became mainstays of the
world-girdling faith Jesus started. However, he says the principle
relationship extends beyond blood to all believers.
   ``I am the vine,'' he said, ``you are the branches.''

<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the 1960s, space exploration opened
new realms for dictionaries. In the '70s, fresh words sprouted from
political scandal. The watchwords of the '80s?
   One dictionary editor nominates an acronym, a single syllable
that stirred growing fear through the decade.
   ``You can't get away from it. AIDS was the word of the '80s,''
said James Lowe, senior editor of Merriam-Webster dictionaries,
headquartered here.
   The abbreviation for acquired immune deficiency syndrome was
seen and heard everywhere by the late 1980s.
   ``The press wrote about it; the schools taught about it; it was
something everybody talked about and knew about, or should have,''
Lowe said.
   The words of the '80s also emerged from new lifestyles, from
business, from the kitchen, from computers.
   Victoria Neufeldt, editor-in-chief of Webster's New World
Dictionary in Cleveland, offered a compound noun, ``couch potato,''
as typifying the decade.
   ``It reflects our great concern with lifestyles during the
1980s,'' she said.
   ``Usually politics is a fertile source of new words, but that
hasn't been the case in the 1980s,'' Lowe said.
   Instead it was a decade when the battle cries of big business,
talk of ``poison pills'' and ``white knights,'' became part of the
general vocabulary, and computer language moved from the office to
the living room.
   The decade opened with ``yuppie'' and ``gridlock.'' We worried
about ``toxic shock syndrome'' and ``Lyme disease.'' Soon we were
carrying ``laptops,'' and doing ``spreadsheets'' on our ``PCs.''
And ``fax'' became a verb.
   The '80s took ``high five'' off the playgrounds and ``handler''
out of the boxing ring and into the political arena.
   We drank ``blush wine'' and listened to ``new wave'' music on
``CDs'' and ``laser discs.'' We read romantic novels and called
them ``bodice-rippers.'' And when the teen-age children of the
teen-agers of the 1950s took to ``doo-wop,'' it rocked into major
dictionaries.
   In the '70s, Americans made verbs out of nouns. In the '80s we
turned to adjectives. ``Microwaveable,'' spelled both with and
without the first ``e,'' was listed by Merriam's. ``I've even seen
`ovenable,''' Lowe said.
   In 1988, ``computer virus'' was Lowe's new word of the year.
   Although the finished product may have the staid voice of
authority, new words get into the dictionary simply by repeated use
in the popular press.
   Lowe's lexicographers spend much of their day reading newspapers
and magazines _ The Wall Street Journal to Playboy _ in hopes of
spotting new words or new uses of words.
   Acceptance takes time, and sometimes lexicographers are as
behind the times as parents everywhere.
   Robert Pease, senior science editor for Merriam's, recalled the
day he first saw ``crack cocaine'' in a Boston newspaper headline
and told his children about the new word, only to have them tell
him it was already the talk of the schoolyards.
   As the 1990s approached and historic events swept East Europe,
the decade ended with a linguistic split decision on ``glasnost.''
   The New World editors included it in their 1988 update of their
Collegiate dictionary, but the jury is still out at Merriam's.
   ``Most writers still treat it as a foreign term and include a
definition,'' Lowe said. ``When they stop including the
explanation, then it will be ready for inclusion.''
   Looking to the next decade, he predicted that most new words
would continue to come from medicine. The recently developed
abortion pill, RU486, ``may be the new word for the 1990s,'' Lowe
said.

   Despite all the ink Hollywood gets, defense
has become a far higher-flying industry in Southern California
since the days of World War II's ``Rosie the Riveter'' and the
legendary Lockheed ``Skunk Works.''
   Now, with the Iron Curtain rusting away by the day, aerospace
workers are wondering what is to become of their industry, third
largest in the Los Angeles region after business-financial services
and tourism.
   There were 420,800 aerospace workers in the area last year,
2,700 fewer than in 1987, according to a study released this month
by the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce. They made up about 7
percent of the region's workers and earned nearly 8 percent of the
wages paid.
   National aerospace employment peaked at 1,313,000 in 1987 and
has stayed about even since, said David Napier, economic data
service manager at the Aerospace Industries Association in
Washington.
   Research suggests every 1 percent cut in real defense spending
costs California 20,000 to 30,000 jobs directly or indirectly, said
David Hensley, head of UCLA's California economic forecasting group.
   Will efforts by some contractors to diversify into civilian
aerospace and high-tech be enough to offset a thawing of the Cold
War?
   ``I was at an international aerospace conference, and a guy
there said he could see Southern California being the `rust belt'
of the 1990s,'' said Wolfgang Demisch, an aerospace analyst who now
heads the research department at UBS Securities in New York.
   ``It was just said in passing, of course. As usual at these
things, there is somebody who throws you a grenade just to wake up
the audience.''
   At places like Los Angeles-based Hughes Aircraft Co., they woke
up long ago to the reality that defense spending, after inflation
adjustments, has been declining for years.
   ``We're not abandoning the defense sector. We regard that as our
duty to the nation,'' said D. Kenneth Richardson, who was appointed
president of Hughes earlier this month. ``But we feel that in the
future most of the growth and opportunity are outside defense.''
   Hughes, a unit of General Motors Corp., is completing a
six-month streamlining that includes 6,000 layoffs among its 75,000
workers because of tighter defense budgets. An additional 4,100
employees were laid off in 1986.
   The satellites and defense electronics company is also moving
into such areas as telecommunications and simulation and training
systems for commercial airlines. It recently won a $325 million
contract to modernize Canada's air-traffic control system and is
bidding on a $210 million contract to upgrade data processing at
the federal Bureau of Land Management.
   ``I'm an upbeat, positive sort of fellow and I think the
company's future is very good,'' said Richardson.
   If less money for the military is accompanied by more for space,
Southern California would benefit. Millions of dollars a year from
the space program already have flooded in.
   For example, El Segundo-based Rockwell International, builder of
the space shuttle, said recently it had received a contract worth
``several hundred million dollars'' to build spare parts for the
shuttle.
   Also boding well for the industry is civilian aircraft work,
where employment is growing fast.
   The Chamber of Commerce study estimated that Seattle-based
Boeing Co., overloaded with orders for civilian aircraft,
subcontracts about $2 billion worth of work each year to Southern
California firms.
   The main bodies on Boeing 747s are assembled by Los
Angeles-based Northrop Corp., which is vulnerable to military
budget cutters because of its own $500 million-per-plane stealth
bomber program.
   McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s Douglas Aircraft subsidiary in Long
Beach has added many workers because of a backlog of orders for
MD-80 commercial jets and the launching of its MD-11 and MD-90
aircraft.
   Longer term, if defense cuts helped lower the national deficit,
California and other areas could benefit from lower interest rates
that would generate more jobs, some economists contend.
   Fred Cannon, senior economist for Bank of America, said less
defense spending also might be a blessing ``because there's not
much of what economists call `value added' in that segment.''
   ``When you make items for the military, you're basically
producing something and then just storing it,'' Cannon said. ``In
other parts of the economy ... you're producing something, selling
it, servicing it, maybe reselling it and on and on _ there's much
more value added.''
   Severe cuts in defense contracting would close a post-World War
II era in Southern California littered with lore, from John
Northrop retiring in 1952, broken-hearted that his Flying Wing
bomber was canceled, to the maiden flight of Northrop's B-2 stealth
bomber _ a flying wing _ last July.
   Perhaps even more famous is Lockheed's so-called Skunk Works in
Burbank, site of the development of the P-80 jet fighter in 1945,
then the U-2 and the SR-71 Blackbird spy planes, and in this decade
the stealth fighter.
   Subcultures grew up around the industry, like the throngs that
parked near the Burbank airport on Friday nights, hoping that a
huge C-5 cargo plane would descend onto darkened Runway 7 and pull
up to Lockheed's Skunk Works to pick up classified loads.
   Dave Rockwell, a C-5 watcher since 1983, was part of a network
of fanatics who would videotape the C-5s as they zoomed in to pick
up what was assumed to be Lockheed stealth fighters, so secret they
officially did not exist.
   ``Not so many people show up now,'' Rockwell said. ``It only
comes in about every 10 weeks, instead of every four or five weeks
before.''

   The numbers tell the tale of a changing
America in the 1980s: more golfers and softball players, less
liquor and red meat, more opera, more imported cars, more mail,
more TV-watching, more prisoners. Higher blood pressure.
   Getting right to the most basic number: The Census Bureau
estimated the population at 246,900,000 as of Jan. 1, 1989. That's
up from the 226,545,805 tallied in the 1980 national headcount.
   These Americans can expect to live longer than their
predecessors. Life expectancy rose from 73.7 years in 1980 to 74.9
as of 1988, according to the National Center for Health Statistics.
   And the shape of those lives is changing, judging from a
snapshot of statistics spanning the decade. (Because of the time it
takes to compile them, some of the latest available statistics are
for 1986 or 1987.)
   On the vital statistics front, the number of marriages and
divorces both slipped slightly. Marriages were down from 2,390,300
in 1980 to 2,389,000 in 1988, while divorces declined from
1,189,000 to 1,183,000.
   The numbers of births and deaths rose. In 1980, there were
1,989,800 deaths reported and 3,612,000 births. In 1988, the deaths
figure stood at 2,171,000, and births at 3,913,000.
   Recreation boomed in the decade. Participation in softball grew
from 30 million people in 1980 to 41 million in 1987. In the same
period the number of golfers increased from 15 million to 21.7
million.
   America also offers more beauty parlors today _ up from 65,700
in 1980 to 73,300 in 1986.
   And for those needing a touch-up, there are also more bathrooms.
In 1980, one single-family home in four had 2{ bathrooms or more.
By 1987 that was up to 38 percent of such homes.
   Speaking of comfort at home, the share of single-family
residences with air conditioning was up from 63 percent to 71
percent.
   In less comfortable circumstances: During the 1980s the number
of people in American prisons skyrocketed from 329,821 in 1980 to
581,609 in 1987.
   At the same time, college enrollment grew only slightly, from
12,097,000 to 12,173,000. The average Scholastic Aptitude Test
scores for college-bound students over those same years rose from
424 to 430 in verbal skills and from 466 to 476 in math.
   In 1980, 17.6 million households _ less than one in four that
had a television _ were served by cable. Now more than half of TV
households have cable, the National Cable Television Association
reports.
   Not everyone is watching MTV, however.
   The number of opera performances increased from 9,391 in 1980 to
11,794 in 1987, with attendance rising from 10.7 million to 16.4
million.
   Symphony concerts declined slightly during the period, from
22,229 to 20,059, but attendance increased from 22.6 million to
25.1 million.
   The cost of mailing a letter, 15 cents in 1980, is 25 cents
today. But the rising price doesn't seem to have discouraged
letter-writing. The Postal Service carried 60.2 billion first-class
letters in 1980 and 82.3 billion in 1988.
   The value of new car imports rose from $16.7 billion in 1980 to
$47.8 billion in 1987, while exports of new cars edged up from $3.9
billion to $6.7 billion in the same period.
   Americans are drinking less liquor. Per-capita consumption fell
from 1.98 gallons in 1980 to 1.54 gallons last year. Even so,
significant increases were reported in sales of cordials and
flavored vodkas, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the
United States.
   Consumption of red meat has declined from almost 157 pounds per
person in 1980 to just 144 pounds in 1987. Pork also plummeted,
from 68 to 59 pounds per person.
   But the Agriculture Department says Americans ate more fish, up
from 13 pounds in 1980 to almost 15 pounds in 1987. At the same
time, poultry consumption jumped from 50 to 62 pounds.
   Fresh fruit consumption also rose, from 86 to almost 99 pounds
each, and Americans are eating more vegetables, too, up from 73 to
79 pounds each.
   Despite healthier habits overall, American health indexes are
not all upbeat. The National Center for Health Statistics reports
that almost 123 of every 1,000 Americans had high blood pressure in
1986, up from 114 per thousand in 1980.

<HEAD>Water Shortages Threaten World Food Supplies</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Stands for BC-Weekly Farm.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Declining fresh water supplies, rising
irrigation costs and growing populations are jeopardizing global
food supplies, a new Worldwatch Institute report says.
   Sandra Postel, author of the report and vice president of the
non-profit, Washington-based research institute, says greater
attention to small-scale irrigation and to ``rainfed'' or dryland
farming could help.
   More research into salt-tolerant and drought-resistant crops
also ``would help prepare for a likely future of increased
shortages and hotter, drier climates'' in some major food areas,
Postel says in the report issued Saturday.
   ``Crucial as they are, though, these measures are but
stopgaps,'' she says. ``Any hope for balancing the water budgets of
many countries with rapidly growing populations hinges as much on
slowing birthrates as it does on improving water productivity.''
   In countries such as Egypt, for example, the population is
growing by 1 million every eight months. Modernizing irrigation
systems will not be enough.
   ``The struggle for a secure water future will not end until
societies recognize water's natural limits and begin to bring human
numbers and demands into line with them,'' Postel says.
   The institute, which is headed by Lester R. Brown, is financed
by private foundations and United Nations organizations. Brown and
the institute's staff are frequent commentators on global problems,
particularly population growth and environmental threats to the
world food system.
   In September, for example, Brown said there is no sure-fire way
to boost global food production enough in the 1990s to keep pace
with indicated population growth.
   Brown has chided President Bush for continuing the Reagan
administration's policy of refusing U.S. support of the United
Nations Population Fund and International Planned Parenthood
Federation.
   Congress recently approved $15 million for the U.N. population
fund included in a foreign aid bill. Bush vetoed the bill on
grounds the fund aids coercive population planning in China,
including the chance of compulsory abortion or involuntary
sterilization.
   The foreign aid measure was passed again by Congress _ without
the $15 million for the population fund _ and was signed by Bush.
   In her report, Postel says agricultural irrigation in 1800
comprised an estimated 20 million acres, or an area about the size
of Austria. A number of large projects, especially in India and
what is now Pakistan, boosted the world's irrigated area by 1900 to
nearly 120 million acres.
   ``As world population grew from 1.6 billion to more than 5
billion over the last 90 years, irrigation became a cornerstone of
global food security,'' she says. ``The higher yields farmers could
get with controllable water supplies proved vital to feeding the
millions added to our numbers each year, especially as
opportunities to cultivate new land dwindled.''
   By 1950, worldwide irrigation nearly doubled to 230 million
acres. It has spread even faster since then, rising to around 620
million acres.
   ``Today, one-third of the global harvest comes from the 17
percent of the world's cropland that is irrigated,'' Postel says.
``Many countries _ such as China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Israel,
Japan, North and South Korea, Pakistan and Peru _ rely on such land
for more than half their domestic food production.''
   But the irrigation growth rate, which averaged 2 percent to 4
percent a year in the 1960s and in the early 1970s, has averaged
only about 1 percent annually since 1979 _ far less than the growth
in world population. The per capita irrigated area peaked at 118.3
acres per 1,000 people in 1978, then decreased to 111.6 acres in
1987, a drop of 5.6 percent.
   Postel cites a number of reasons for the irrigation slowdown:
low prices for food commodities, comparatively high energy costs
and general economic conditions that generally discouraged
agricultural investments.
   ``Should grain prices rise because of diminished global stocks _
a possibility during the '90s _ investments will almost certainly
pick up again,'' she says. ``But the poor who suffer most from food
shortages are unlikely to be able to afford crops at the prices
needed to inspire suich investments.''
   Thus, Postel says, for the foreseeable future irrigation's
contribution to an expanded food supply will have to come from the
improvement of existing systems.
   Meanwhile, irrigation is taking an ecological toll of the
Earth's resources as each year some 786 cubic miles of water _ six
times the annual flow of the Mississippi River _ are taken from
rivers, streams and underground aquifers.
   ``Practiced on such a scale, irrigation has had a profound
impact on global water bodies and on the cropland receiving it,''
Postel says. ``Waterlogged and salted lands, declining and
contaminated aquifers, shrinking lakes and inland seas, and the
destruction of aquatic habitats combine to hang on irrigation a
high environmental price.''

<HEAD>Recession Fears Again Bedevil Wall Street</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the waning weeks of a prosperous but
worry-filled decade for the stock market, recession anxieties once
again are clouding investors' outlooks.
   All through the long bull market and economic expansion that
date back to 1982, Wall Street has been beset by periodic fears of
an economic downturn.
   Each one proved to be a false alarm _ even the market crash of
1987, which was widely heralded at the time as a portent of gloom,
if not outright doom.
   Even so, the prospect of a recession surfaces in just about any
discussion of the economy and the markets in the early 1990s. The
Federal Reserve implicitly has acknowledged the threat with moves
over the past several months to relax its credit policy by
encouraging interest rates to decline.
   ``Normally, when the Fed loosens because of a recession, it's
bullish for stocks,'' said Martin Zweig, editor of the advisory
letter Zweig Forecast in Bellmore, N.Y.
   ``The problem _ or the difference _ this time is that a
recession has not likely been discounted yet by the stock market.''
   Many who side with the bullish camp say the current scare has no
more valid basis than the others that have gripped the financial
world in recent years.
   True, they acknowledge, corporate profits have been slumping for
several months, and the fourth-quarter reports that will be issued
in early 1990 aren't likely to look very pretty either.
   But they say earnings have gone through sluggish periods before
_ for example, in the mid-1980s _ without signaling any
economy-wide slump.
   Furthermore, they contend, the harbingers of a textbook
recession simply aren't present in the current economic climate.
   If they were, over-enthusiastic businesses would be producing
more than they could sell, causing a big buildup of inventories in
the pipelines of the economy. Such excesses would be exerting
upward pressure on inflation and interest rates.
   And the Fed would be working to keep the economy from
overheating by tightening its grip on money and credit.
   ``If the conventional wisdom turns out to be correct _ no
recession in the classic sense, but simply a slowdown in 1990 _ the
stock market at worst should mark time and at best could well be
surprisingly robust,'' said David Eisenberg at Sanford C. Bernstein
&amp; Co.
   Stock traders seemed to be reserving judgment on that question
in the past week. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which
had climbed 72.10 points in the previous week, slipped back 16.21
to 2,731.44.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index dropped .74 to
192.92; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
lost .88 to 456.22, and the American Stock Exchange market value
index was down .13 at 375.45.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 151.55 million shares a day,
against 160.57 million the week before.
   One primary force that could contribute to an unconventional
recession, many observers agree, is the debt that has built up
through the '80s, particularly in the corporate world and in real
estate.
   ``Many highly leveraged companies will not be able to survive if
their markets soften,'' said George Putnam III in the advisory
publication The Turnaround Letter.
   ``If there is a broad-based recession, we will see a significant
increase in defaults and bankruptcies.''
   Added Zweig: ``If the economy were to really hit the skids, I
would expect real estate to be in the vanguard.
   ``Recent data show that real estate prices have been easing all
over the country with the exception of Portland and Seattle. The
glut which Uncle Sam has inherited from the savings and loans isn't
going to help.''

<HEAD>When IBM, Chrysler and McGraw-Hill Retreat in One Week, It Means
Something</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   IBM is cutting 10,000 jobs, Chrysler is
scrapping a highly touted diversification and McGraw-Hill is
undergoing a drastic reorganization, all in the name of raising
profits.
   But when three of America's leading companies take steps like
these in the space of one week, it's almost like dumping icewater
on any illusions that the broader economy is healthy and growing
stronger.
   ``I think these companies are all gearing up for what is going
to be a pretty cool climate next year,'' said Robert J. Eggert,
editor of Blue Chip Economic Indicators, an investment newsletter
and advisory service in Sidona, Ariz. ``The year ahead of us is
going to be the slowest growth year we've had since the recession
of 1982.''
   The severity of the cost-cutting and strategy realignments
announced by International Business Machines Corp., Chrysler Motors
Corp. and McGraw-Hill Inc. this past week were rooted partly in
each company's particular problems.
   But they also reflected troubling common elements: saturation of
the U.S. market for computers, cars and communications products,
high domestic interest rates that raise the cost of doing business,
and an increasingly tough competition abroad, where much of the
potential for growth exists.
   ``I think the major thrust for the companies taking these
actions is that the world has become extremely competitive over the
last five years,'' said Lester Morris, chief executive officer of
Mesirow Financial, a Chicago-based investment firm.
   ``In order to remain competitive, they have to slim down and get
rid of a lot of fat,'' he said. ``I know it's a cliche but this is
a global economy. All these companies are competing worldwide.''
   These strategic corporate retreats come against a background of
evidence that the U.S. economy, which by standard government
measurements has been growing for more than seven years, has
seriously weakened, particularly in the past few months.
   The latest signal came Friday when the Labor Department reported
higher unemployment in November and a sharply lower number of new
jobs created in October than previously believed.
   ``I think it seems very clear based on the numbers we've seen
that the economy is slowing considerably,'' said Michael Moran,
economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc. in New York. ``The
numbers that have been coming in recently suggest something in
neighborhood of 1 percent to 1.5 percent growth is likely in the
fourth quarter. Even below 1 percent is a possibility.''
   For IBM, once considered a showcase American company with such
awesome dominance that even Japanese computer makers gave it
grudging respect, the $2.3 billion restructuring was considered a
sign that Big Blue finally has faced reality: its domestic profits
haven't grown for five years. The restructuring will eliminate
10,000 jobs and presumably save IBM $1 billion in annual costs.
   In Chrysler's case, the No. 3 automaker trashed a strategy begun
only a few years ago, to hedge its future by diversifying into
other industries. It is a strategy that rivals General Motors Corp.
and Ford Motor Co. also embraced, increasing speculation that they
might be rethinking their plans as well.
   Chrysler said it was seeking a buyer for its technology unit,
which includes the Gulfstream Aerospace business jet maker and
Electrospace Systems defense contractor.
   Chrysler spent more than $1 billion for those businesses.
Proceeds of the sale presumably would help prepare Chrysler for the
staggering costs of revamping its vehicle product line for the
1990s.
   Abandoning diversification seemed to mark an admission by
Chrysler that it must concentrate on doing what it knows best,
making automobiles, one of the world's most brutally competitive
industries.
   For McGraw-Hill, a leading information publishing concern, the
$220 million restructuring that will cut 1,000 jobs from a
13,700-member workforce also reflects the intense competition faced
by the company. McGraw-Hill has been considered a possible takeover
target because of its depressed stock price.
   Still, none of the restructurings announced this past week did
much for the stock prices of the companies or the broader market.
That was considered a sign of deep investor pessimism about the
impact of an economic slowdown.
   ``All these things are beginning to mount up,'' said Eggert.
``It's going to seem like a recession in many areas.''
   In other business an economic news this past week:
   _The thrift crisis claimed another casualty only this time it
was a human. M. Danny Wall, director of the Office of Thrift
Supervision, resigned under pressure, the first government official
to quit in a widening scandal over the mismanagement and lax
regulation of the nation's savings &amp; loans.
   _A possible takeover struggle in the oil industry surfaced after
Pennzoil Corp. announced it had bought 8.8 percent of Chevron Corp.
for $2.1 billion. Chevron took steps to block a takeover from the
much smaller Pennzoil, cash rich from its historic lawsuit
settlement with Texaco Inc. last year.
   _Airlines slapped passengers with fare increases during the busy
holiday season. Major carriers said that starting Dec. 16 they
would raise prices of their cheapest tickets between $10 and $20,
although they also will waive advance purchase requirements for a
time.

   Farewell to the 1980s, and to so much of the old
order.
   Farewell, Cold War. So long, Iron Curtain. Goodbye, Berlin Wall,
a worn-out symbol disintegrating like worn-out mortar.
   Adieu, freewheeling sex, made high-risk by the dread of AIDS.
   Farewell, games of innocence, your boys hooked on steroids,
laying bets.
   So long, visions of American invincibility, held hostage by
terrorists.
   Godspeed, Voyager 2, mission accomplished, rocketing to where no
spacecraft has gone before.
   Goodbye, American Century, eclipsed by a rising Japanese sun.
   Even if history worked on the decimal system, a decade like the
1980s defied glib labels. But it was a dizzying, dynamic time of
new highs and lows, worsts and firsts, advances and reversals,
breakdowns and breakthroughs.
   Ronald Reagan reigned. Mikhail S. Gorbachev restructured. Ivan
Boesky prescribed.
   ``Greed is healthy,'' the doctor of arbitrage proclaimed.
Money-mad Wall Streeters traded inside information illegally. Ben
Johnson was the fastest Olympian on steroids, turning his world
record medal to fool's gold. Nothing succeeded like excess in the
race to have it all.
   U.S. baby boomers turned fortysomething but remained in love
with themselves and gizmos of instant gratification such as VCRs,
PCs, CDs, BMWs, MTV, microwaves, fax mail, cellular phones, lite
beer and Lean Cuisine.
   And the Earth spun on despite an ozone hole, the greenhouse
effect, natural disasters and man-made scourges of Bhopal,
Chernobyl, the Exxon Valdez, wayward garbage scows and
syringe-spattered shorelines.
   Four decades of East-West tension went out of fashion, and the
man who set the fashion four decades ago said it was so.
Diplomat-historian George Kennan, theorist of 1940s anti-Soviet
``containment,'' sat before Congress and pronounced: ``The Cold War
has been left in the past.''
   A new epoch was proclaimed by Gorbachev, ``a new world of
freedom'' by President Bush.
   Gorbachev took power in 1985, the fourth Soviet leader in 28
months, and inherited a torpid bureaucracy and failing economy.
Departing from the three aged autocrats who preceded him, Gorbachev
jolted totalitarianism with ``glasnost'' and ``perestroika'':
openness and restructuring.
   Reagan, the former actor who was the first two-term U.S.
president in a generation, called the Soviet Union an ``evil
empire.'' But he later agreed to a breakthrough in arms control _
destruction of a class of nuclear weapons aimed at that empire.
   In Eastern Europe, history's tectonic plates shifted, and the
communist monopoly crumbled.
   The spasms of self-determination began in Poland, where food
cost so much in 1980 that Solidarity, formed under upstart Gdansk
electrician Lech Walesa, quickly gained wide popular support.
   The union was outlawed and Walesa was jailed for 11 months under
martial law. But Solidarity re-emerged to force free elections, and
the union now controls the first non-communist government in the
East bloc.
   Hungary dissolved its communist party and lifted the physical
and psychological barrier of the barbed-wire Iron Curtain.
   An East German exodus of 225,000 people was the biggest since
1961, when the Berlin Wall clamped a human hemorrhage.
   The jagged scar of the wall was condemned by every U.S.
president since Kennedy as the quintessential fault line of a
system that controlled people by locking them in.
   On Nov. 9, 1989, the wall that 191 people died trying to cross
opened, without a drop of blood shed.
   Aftershocks led to new leadership in Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia.
   But in China's Tiananmen Square, earlier in the year,
pro-democracy student rallies were crushed by the rumble of
People's Army tanks. Hundreds were killed, and China later executed
ringleaders.
   On the home front, Reagan survived a would-be assassin's bullet
in 1981 to launch supply-side economics with its trickle-down
theory.
   Tax breaks were welcomed by the rich. But the gap between
America's rich and poor grew, the budget deficit multiplied to $150
billion, the United States became the world's largest debtor
nation, and the national debt neared $3 trillion. Reagan
accumulated more red ink than all of his predecessors combined.
   Military spending reached record levels. The built-up Pentagon's
biggest real-life operation: the invasion of Grenada, an island
speck in the Caribbean.
   The economy broke new ground with a seven-year expansion, but
unequaled riches were balanced against an estimated 3 million
homeless, stubborn poverty and Rust Belt woes.
   America's post-World War II economic domination of the world
gave way as new economic powers arose. New York's Rockefeller
Center passed from control of one of America's mightiest industrial
families to a Japanese bank, a transaction that symbolized the new
era.
   Reagan's legacy included Sandra Day O'Connor, the first woman
appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which reopened the abortion
issue over how much right a woman has to her own body.
   The legacy also included a raft of scandals _ Iran-Contra, HUD,
Pentagon procurement, savings-and-loans _ all inherited by Bush as
he brought the yelp of puppies, the clang of horseshoes and the
quotable Dan Quayle to the White House.
   Bush's well-read lips promised a kinder, gentler nation after
prospering with Willie Horton ads.
   It was a decade to forget for Democrats from Jimmy Carter to
Michael Dukakis. Walter Mondale partnered with Geraldine Ferraro
and carried his home state of Minnesota, but lost 49 others. Gary
Hart teamed with Donna Rice and got ``Monkey Business.''
   Jesse Jackson became the first black to win a presidential
primary.
   Those who broke the rules kept headline writers busy as America
agonized over ethics and morals.
   On Wall Street, where $25 billion takeovers became reality,
crime wore fancy French cufflinks. Boesky pleaded guilty in an
insider trading scandal; junk bondsman Michael Milken was indicted
for alleged securities fraud.
   In 1987, the market dropped 508 points in its worst day ever, a
stark comeuppance for fresh-faced MBAs who expected to have it all
but learned life and their six-figure incomes had limits.
   But charity had its moments, too. Live Aid helped starving
Ethiopians; Farm Aid brought relief to American farmers.

   TV evangelists had a devil of a time. Jim Bakker had sex with
Jessica Hahn, lost his PTL ministry and went to jail for fleecing
his flock. Jimmy Swaggart confessed to moral failure with a New
Orleans prostitute.
   On the other hand, Playboy potentate Hugh Hefner made an honest
woman out of one of his Bunnies by wedding her, which some
sociologists said heralded the end to the one-night stand. Go
figure.
   The sheer terror of AIDS, which can be spread through sex, did
its part to modify behavior. Almost 70,000 Americans died of AIDS
during the decade, including Rock Hudson, Liberace, and artists,
athletes and journalists.
   Gambling turned Pete Rose's field of dreams into a baseball
nightmare. The belly-flopping Charlie Hustle broke Ty Cobb's
cherished record for all-time hits. But he was banned for life for
betting on games in the sport's worst scandal in seven decades.
   Michael Jackson moonwalked with a single, sequined glove, and
his ``Thriller'' album sold a record 40 million copies. Material
girl Madonna flashed Marilyn Monroe-style sex appeal.
   American life in the '80s had a deadly side, too.
   Drug wars sizzled as the Cold War thawed. Crack cocaine,
virtually unheard of in 1985, riddled American cities with the
randomness of an assault gun by decade's end.
   Mass murderers stalked a McDonald's in San Ysidro, Calif., a
schoolyard in Stockton, Calif., and a printing plant in Louisville,
Ky. Serial killer Ted Bundy was executed; Seattle's Green River
killer, blamed for over 40 deaths, remained at large.
   Around the world, war broke old yardsticks for barbarity with
modern weapons that killed and maimed with cold efficiency.
   Iran and Iraq fought a $400 billion, eight-year conflict that
cost up to 1 million lives. The ayatollah's boy soldiers carried
their own coffins into battle; Iraq countered human waves with
poison gas.
   Americans, too, killed and were killed in the Persian Gulf. An
Iraqi missile killed 37 sailors aboard the USS Stark, which was
mistaken for an Iranian warship. The USS Vincennes confused an Iran
Air A300 Airbus for a warplane, killing 290 civilians with a
missile, an eerie near-replay of another ``shootdown,'' when a
Soviet fighter blew Korean Air Lines Flight 007 out the sky,
killing 269 people, after the jetliner wandered into forbidden
airspace.
   Beirut got bloodier during a 14-year-old civil war between
age-old religious foes. Two Lebanese presidents were assassinated
seven years apart, the second only 17 days into his tenure.
   All told, Lebanon's casualties mounted to 150,000, mostly
civilians. And again America paid a price. Sixty-three people were
killed in 1983 when a suicide truck bomber leveled the U.S.
Embassy, and 241 U.S. servicemen, serving as peacekeepers, died in
the terror bombing of their barracks.
   In Afghanistan, a civil war between the Soviet-backed government
and U.S.-supported insurgents claimed 1.5 million lives. Gorbachev
called the conflict ``a bleeding wound,' and ended nine years of
intervention by Soviet military forces in 1989. The Soviet toll:
13,310 dead.
   In Ethiopia, a non-stop civil war worsened the suffering of a
killer drought. Casualties from fighting and famine were estimated
at 1 million.
   Assassins felled Egypt's Anwar Sadat, India's Indira Gandhi and
the Philippine opposition leader Benigno Aquino, whose widow,
Corazon, later was elected president and ousted Ferdinand Marcos
and his well-shod wife, Imelda.
   John Lennon was silenced by a bullet. Pope John Paul II, like
Reagan, survived a gunman's attempt.
   Terrorism, some of it government-subsidized, spread insidiously.
   U.S. hostages were freed by Iran on Jan. 20, 1981, the day
Reagan was sworn in and Jimmy Carter exited the White House.
   But more hostages were grabbed by Iran-backed extremists in
Beirut. Eight Americans are still held, including journalist Terry
Anderson, now in his fifth year of captivity.
   Reagan retaliated for a terrorist bombing in West Germany with
an air strike against Libya's Col. Moammar Gadhafi, whom he called
``the mad dog of the Middle East.''
   Terrorists hijacked airplanes and a cruise ship. A bomb downed
Pan Am Flight 103 in 1988, resulting in 270 deaths.
   Terror of a natural sort stalked the globe. Technology gave man
new weapons for tracking storms and predicting disasters. But
Gilbert and Hugo redefined the power and cost of hurricanes.
   An angry Earth blew its top in 1980 at Mount St. Helens, and a
Colombian volcano hatched a 1985 mudslide that killed 25,000. The
ground quaked in Southern Italy, Mexico City, Soviet Armenia and
Northern California.
   These were the '80s, when the Stars and Stripes were burnable,
and the Hammer and Sickle drooped listless in the ill winds, but
both were waved by U.S. sailors at a seaborne summit.
   If the fast-forward blur of change seemed too much, solace could
be found in the durability of democracy's icons: The U.S.
Constitution began its third century; the Statue of Liberty had a
makeover and celebrated its 100th birthday.
   And in the new revolutions, the words of an old revolution,
Jefferson's revolution, rang out.
   ``We hold these truths to be self-evident,'' a brewery worker in
Czechoslovakia declaimed to fellow strikers as the decade closed,
``that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their
creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness.''

<TEXT>
   While Ronald Reagan was president, the
reigning cliche was that his impact would last far beyond his years
and that his legacies would be felt in government well into the
next century.
   His time in office was ``the Reagan Revolution.'' His fiscal
ideas were ``Reaganomics.'' His was ``the Reagan Era.''
   But less than a year later, the talk about any lingering
influence is fading and people instead are discussing the $2
million Reagan got for a couple of speeches in Japan, the sudden
graying of his hair, and the control his wife's astrologer
exercised over his life in the White House.
   Many pillars of the Reagan program are crumbling. Even before
the recent astonishing upheavals in communist East Europe, Reagan
had retreated from his ``Evil Empire'' characterization of the
Soviet Union.
   Reagan's first official act, minutes after he took the oath as
president, was to announce an immediate hiring freeze, filling a
campaign promise. ``This begins the process of restoring our
economic strength and returning the nation to prosperity,'' he said.
   He did restore economic strength, using enormous amounts of
borrowed money to fuel the nation' longest peacetime economic
recovery after a deep recession in 1981-82 that finally subdued
inflation.
   The hiring freeze itself was a failure. The executive branch had
3,971,802 civilian and military jobs in 1980. At the end of
Reagan's eight years, that figure had risen to 5,079,630.
   Reagan's promise to balance the federal budget was hollow. Jimmy
Carter's deficit in 1980 was $73.8 billion. Under Reagan, that
fattened to $221.1 billion in 1986, even as he preached the need
for restraint. In eight years, Reagan piled up more red ink than
all 39 previous presidents combined as the debt went from under $1
trillion to nearly $3 trillion. That is one legacy that will
survive.
   His catastrophic illness insurance plan for the elderly _ which
the president proclaimed would protect seniors against ``a choice
between bankruptcy and death'' _ was law for only a year before
Congress repealed it. The pressure was applied by prosperous
seniors who didn't like the feature of which Reagan was proudest:
that it was financed by beneficiaries themselves.
   Reagan proposed the Strategic Defense Initiative _ ``Star Wars''
_ as ``the most hopeful possibility of the nuclear age.'' Not only
did that run into opposition from experts who said it would not
work, but in this first post-Reagan year Congress cut $1 billion
from the administration request.
   And where Reagan pushed a military buildup, there now is a
proposal _ by the secretary of defense _ to cut military spending
by $180 billion over three years.
   Other than the deficit, the most lasting impact of the Reagan
years may be in the Supreme Court. By appointing Justices Sandra
Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy, and elevating
William H. Rehnquist to chief justice, Reagan gave the court a
narrow conservative majority.
   But when Reagan's supporters speak now of his legacy, they are
most likely to speak of the intangibles that served him so well in
office.
   ``George Bush leads an America that has been changed profoundly
by the Reagan Revolution,'' wrote Burton Yale Pines of the
conservative Heritage Foundation. Bush, he said, ``finds himself
leading a nation that is much healthier, stronger, more confident,
more optimistic, and even much happier than the nation that Reagan
found himself leading in 1981.''
   In one category Reagan outshone every other president in the
last half of the 20th Century. He was unquestionably the best-liked
of the lot.
   More than any other, Reagan seemed to enjoy being president. The
old actor had the best role of his life and he played it to the
hilt. He looked like a president and that rubbed off on the nation.
With Nancy at his side, her adoring eyes glued on her husband,
America indulged in its secret fondness for royalty.
   Never mind that his grasp of the issues was often less than
sure. When he tossed that salute to the Marine at the door of his
helicopter, when he addressed the Congress, when he sat erect in
the wingback chair in the Oval Office bantering with other heads of
state, he was the president and there was no mistaking it.
   Alonzo L. Hamby, a history professor at Ohio University, has
written that Reagan ``likely will be remembered as an outstanding
national cheerleader.''
   But he also will be remembered as the ``Teflon president,'' in
the dazzling description coined by Rep. Pat Schroeder, D-Colo.
Nothing bad ever stuck to him.
   Reagan spoke of ``the renewal of the American spirit'' and it
became his banner. His legendary and incredible luck began with the
swearing-in-ceremony. The Americans who had been held hostage in
Iran were released after 444 days _ but not until Jimmy Carter had
passed from the stage.
   He presided smiling and unruffled over an administration noted
for its ethical problems. They ranged all over the lot: officials
abusing civil service rules or misspending government money for
private travel; influence-peddling and buying; a department head
misusing chauffeured government limousines; conflicts of interest;
using government personnel for private business. The list includes
the Iran-Contra affair, which embarrassed Reagan but never dented
his halo, and the HUD and savings and loan scandals which didn't
flower until he returned to California.
   Reagan seemed to be immune, blessed always with an unshakable
popularity. He surmounted national tragedy _ the 1983 bombing of
Marine headquarters in Beirut that killed 241 U.S. servicemen _ and
serious problems with his health.
   The country was put at ease by Reagan's aw-shucks demeanor in
personal crises. After being shot, three months in office, he
quipped to Nancy that ``Honey, I forgot to duck.'' He underwent
surgery for colon cancer and for skin cancer and to correct a
problem with his hand and fingers. Where Lyndon Johnson after an
operation gave the nation an undignified look at his scar, Reagan
is remembered for his bright grin and an OK sign from his hospital
window.
   George H. Nash, a biographer of Herbert Hoover, predicts Reagan
will be judged ``a singular statesman, and for a reason few of his
critics understand.''
   Reagan, says Nash, ``reaffirmed with eloquence the continuing
validity and vitality of the American Dream. In this more than in
any policies or decisions lie his legacy and enduring claim to
greatness.''

   Strict new financial standards took effect
that will force more than a third of the nation's savings
institutions to shrink or shut down if they can't raise new capital.
   Only 1,800 of the 2,900 S&amp;Ls have enough capital to satisfy the
requirement, prompting industry analysts to nickname Thursdays'
deadline ``Pearl Harbor Day'' because it coincided with the 48th
anniversary of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.
   The new rules were required under S&amp;L bailout legislation
enacted Aug. 9 and are considered the cornerstone reform of the

<HEAD>Italian Auto Giant Acquires Major Stake In Maserati</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TURIN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fiat, Italy's auto giant, has acquired a
nearly one-half stake in Maserati in a decisive step toward
effective control of Italian auto production.
   The Turin-based industrial group, which is controlled by the
Agnelli family, announced Thursday it would pay an undisclosed
amount in cash for 49 percent of the stock of Societa Maserati, a
new corporation formed by Fiat Auto and Officine Maserati of
Modena, the Italian luxury-car maker owned by Argentine-born
industrialist Alejandro De Tomaso.
   In addition, Fiat would acquire from Maserati 51 percent of the
stock of Innocenti Milano, a Maserati subsidiary which makes
sub-compact cars.
   De Tomaso Industries, the U.S.-based company that controls
Maserati, will hold 51 percent of Societa Maserati.
   Under the agreement, the new company would manufacture and
distribute Maserati cars through an existing Maserati network of
independent distributors and dealers. It will also produce 30,000
Panda models for Fiat Auto annually, beginning in 1990.
   The agreement was seen by analysts as a move to help resolve
Fiat's production capacity problems while granting some relief to
Maserati's debt troubles.
   The new acquisition will give Fiat, which took over Alfa Romeo
of Milan in 1987, an annual production capacity of over 2 million
cars.
   The joint output of Officine Maserati and Innocenti amounted to
16,000 cars last year.
   Chrysler Corp., the U.S. auto company which is a Maserati
shareholder and bondholder, has been informed of the transaction,
Fiat said.

   Assets of the nation's 469 money market mutual
funds fell $431.4 million in the latest week, the Investment
Company Institute said.
   The decline, to $367.14 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a $660 million drop in the funds' assets the
previous week, the Washington-based mutual fund trade group said
Thursday.
   The funds' assets hit a record high $368.23 billion in the week
ended Nov. 21, 1989.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 228 general purpose funds rose $319.6 million to $119.53
billion, assets of 97 broker-dealer funds dropped $36.1 million to
$159.03 billion, and assets of 144 institutional funds declined
$714.9 million to $88.58 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 7.94 percent from 7.93 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell to 7.97 percent from 8.01 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
44 days, unchanged from the previous week, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan associations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts rose to
6.37 percent as of Wednesday from 6.36 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, was unchanged at 5.08 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 8.01
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 8.05 the
previous week. Yields were 8.04 percent on 1-year CDs, down from
8.07 percent; 7.98 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 8.01 percent;
and 7.99 percent on 5-year CDs, down from 8.01 percent.

<TEXT>
   The New York Stock Exchange has named General
Motors Corp. Chairman Roger Smith to head a panel examining stock
market volatility.
   The exchange commissioned the panel shortly after a 190-point
drop in the Dow Jones 30-stock industrial average on Oct. 13, which
triggered concerns that computerized program trading had damaged
market stability and driven away individual investors.
   ``I believe addressing investor concerns in today's increasingly

our nation at this time,'' Smith said Thursday in a statement.
   ``The equity and related capital markets are a cornerstone of
the overall health and growth of our country's market-driven
economy, and all Americans have a vital interest in their
continuing ability to play that role,'' he said.
   The panel is charged with addressing concerns about volatility,
analyzing the impact of rapid price swings in the market and
recommend changes.
   The NYSE said the panel also will include representatives of
individual and institutional investors, higher education, equities
and futures exchanges, NYSE member firms and NYSE-listed companies.
   The exchange said the panel's work is expected to take about six
months.
   Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. said Smith has a
``long-term perspective on the interests of corporations and their
shareholders ... and the importance to the American economy of
maintaining strong capital markets for all participants.''
   The stock exchange last month also imposed curbs during periods
of volatility that limit program trading and give individual
investors trading priority, and asked member firms to refrain from
program trading during unsteady times.
   The reforms followed the Oct. 13 drop and a sharp 80-point rise
in the Dow average on Oct. 24.

<HEAD>Indebtedness Posts Biggest Increase in 5 Months</HEAD>

   Americans took out $3.34 billion more in
consumer credit than they retired in October, posting the biggest
increase in net consumer debt in five months, the Federal Reserve
Board said.
   The Fed said Thursday that consumer credit advanced in October
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.7 percent, the sharpest
increase since a 7.3 percent gain in May, when credit rose $4.21
billion.
   Consumer credit outstanding had risen 2.3 percent in September,
which was revised upward from the 1 percent increase originally
reported. Net loan totals were adjusted from $606 million to $1.37
billion.
   Auto loans, which fell 3.2 percent in September after remaining
flat in August, grew by $1.1 billion, or 4.5 percent on an annual
rate, in October.
   But economists said that because of a lag in approving
applications and then reporting credit, the auto loan figures
reflected sales made in September, not October.
   ``The timing of credit and the sales often don't match up,''
said Cynthia Latta, an economist with DRI-McGraw-Hill, a Lexington,
Mass., forecasting organization.
   ``There's really a rush to get cars into the sales column, but
if you sign an agreement to buy a car, you might not actually get
the credit for another week,'' she said.
   Automakers had reported that October sales of new cars and light
trucks were down 14.1 percent from October 1988 as incentives were
dropped and new-model sticker prices rose.
   But sales were robust in August and September as consumers were
lured by end-of-model-year incentives and fears of higher prices
for 1990 models.
   The category of debt that includes credit cards jumped to a 6.4
percent annual rate of growth from a 5.6 percent advance in
September. Total revolving debt rose $1.04 billion, compared to a
$904 million gain the previous month.
   Bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate rose
$1.23 billion, a 7.5 percent annual rate of growth, compared with a
gain of $1.2 million, or 7.3 percent, in September.
   Mobile home debts fell again, down $26 million or a 1.4 percent
rate of decline. These debts had fallen for seven consecutive
months until rising $53 million in September, 2.8 percent on an
annual rate.
   The various changes left total consumer debt in October at a
seasonally adjusted $707.7 billion.

<TEXT>
   A Connecticut company has announced it will
build Poland's first cable television system in a $900 million
partnership with several Polish groups.
   Chase Enterprises of Hartford said Thursday it will have a 70
percent stake in Polska Telewizja Kablowa, or PTK, a cable
television system it will build and operate along with Poltelkab SA.
   Poltelkab SA, which will own the remaining 30 percent, is a
partnership comprising the Polish post, telephone and telegraph
company; Polish Radio and Television Productions Co.; and the city
governments of Warsaw and Cracow.
   Company Chairman David Chase, a Pole who fled the Auschwitz Nazi
concentration camp at age 14 during World War II, said it is the
first communications-related joint venture established under
Poland's December 1988 joint venture law.
   ``We view this as only the first of many projects we will
undertake with Poland and in other economically emerging Eastern
European countries,'' Chase said in a statement.
   The programming for the Polish system still is under
negotiation, but is expected to include a number of
satellite-delivered U.S. services, including CNN, ESPN and MTV, as
well as movie, drama and sports channels, Chase said.
   The announcement was another indication of the new business
opportunities that are opening up in Eastern Europe for Western
telecommunications businesses. Just this week:
   _Denver-based US West International announced it will build and
operate Eastern Europe's first cellular telephone system in Hungary
in a joint venture with Magyar Posta, the Hungarian postal,
telegraph and telecommunications organization.
   _US West also said Thursday it plans a joint venture to build a
fiber-optic cable telecommunications line across the Soviet Union
to link the Soviets with Japan and Europe. Other principals in the
project are the Soviet Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications;
Kokusai Denshin Denwa of Japan; Societa Finanziaria Telefonica of
Italy; British Telecom; OTC of Australia; Denmark's Great Nordic
Telegraph Co. and Telecom Denmark; and the Deutsche Bundespost
Telekom of West Germany.
   _San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis will have a 26 percent
interest in the Mannesmann Mobilfunk GmbH consortium that will
build and operate a second national cellular telephone system in
West Germany. The West German government operates the other.
Pacific will be partners with Mannesmann AG; Deutsche
Genossenschaftsbank; Cable and Wireless PLC; Lyonnaise des Eaux;
and the National Associations of Electrical and Automobile Trades.
   Chase Enterprises' 20-year joint venture will provide cable TV
service to Poland's 8 million homes, with construction to begin
within months in Warsaw and Cracow on an 18-channel system that
will reach 1.8 million homes, Chase said.
   He said Poland currently has two television channels, each
broadcasting a portion of the day. He said about 90 percent of
Polish households have TV sets.
   Polish Ambassador Jan Kinast called the agreement ``yet another
proof that Poland, which has embarked on a new road of profound
political and economic change, is fully open to cooperation abroad.
The development of this specific investment is an important
reflection of the increasingly dynamic and expanding
Polish-American relationship.''
   Chase is a retail shopping center developer whose interests also
include radio and TV stations, cellular telephone and cable TV
systems, insurance and financial services.

<HEAD>Study of Frequency Allocation System Launched</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Commerce Department has begun a study that
could lead to an overhaul of an aging radio frequency allocation
system under siege from cellular telephones, pagers and muscular
new technologies such as high-definition television.
   The National Telecommunications and Information Administration,
part of the Commerce Department, invited public comment Thursday on
the use and management of the radio frequency spectrum as a first
step towards a study it said ``will establish the spectrum policy
foundations that will lead the United States into the 21st
century.''
   The study will be the first major examination of the radio
spectrum since the late 1960s.
   The study will address the regulatory process, allocations,
alternatives for apportioning spectrum, spectrum conservation and
new technologies and forecasting future spectrum requirements.
   New technologies promise more efficient use of the airwaves by
sharing frequencies without causing interference. But federal
regulators are hampered by the current system, which awards blocks
of space to categories of users regardless of how much or how
little those blocks ultimately are used.
   The head of the Commerce Department agency, Janice Obuchowski,
said changing technology, ``coupled with explosive growth in
demand, makes spectrum reform more necessary today, and potentially
more feasible, than it has been in past years.''
   There is an increasing demand for airspace to accommodate more
cellular telephones and new communications devices that are being
developed, such as wrist-sized pagers and automobile tracking
equipment.
   High-definition television, if it is to become a reality in the
next decade, will need more of the frequency spectrum. UHF
television stations may end up sharing some of their airwaves with
these new technologies.
   The government has been criticized for not using its own
frequency allocations efficiently, and the House is considering a
bill by Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., that would require the
government to relinquish frequencies for private use.
   The Commerce Department agency said its study will examine
possible changes in the current spectrum allocation system,
increased sharing of airwaves between government and private users
and whether some users may be able to switch to new delivery
systems such as fiber optic cable.
   Radio systems with fixed transmitters and receivers could be
linked by fiber, which has vastly greater capacity and needs less
long-distance amplification in comparision with copper wire or
coaxial cables.
   Obuchowski acknowleged that it would be difficult to persuade
existing users to give way to others and said the agency's
recommendations, if adopted by the Federal Communications
Commission, would not mean ``radical'' changes in spectrum
allocation that could make obsolete billions of dollars worth of
radio and television equipment.
   She said she favored auctions of spectrum for new commercial
licenses or leases, in much the same way the government leases
public land for grazing or oil exploration.
   Obuchowski said she hopes to have the study completed next year.

<HEAD>New Rule Aims To Encourage Auto Defects Reporting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new rule requires that automobile
manufacturers include a government hotline number in vehicle
owner's manuals to encourage reports of defects by car buyers,
federal highway official announced.
   A spokeswoman for a consumer group that has been pushing for the
rule said the action Thursday is a move away from the agency's
``tombstone technology,'' which she said results in action being
taken only after deaths and injuries occur.
   The Auto Safety Hotline, in operation since 1975, receives about
a quarter million calls a year either requesting auto safety
information or reporting problems.
   ``This requirement will make it easier for consumers to contact
us to report a safety problem,'' said National Highway Traffic
Safety Administrator Jerry R. Curry.
   The rule proscribes three paragraphs that will have to be
included in manuals for any vehicle manufactured after next Sept.
1, including information about the safety agency's powers to order
defects investigations and recalls. But it will note that NHTSA
``cannot get involved in individiaul problems between you, your
dealer or manufacturer.''
   The toll-free hotline is 1-800-424-9393.
   Curry said the telephone service has recently been upgraded with
an automated operator system to process requests for recall
information and handle a larger volume of calls.
   Formal defects report forms will be sent to drivers who report
problems.
   Rosemary Dunlap, president of Motor Voters, said the new NHTSA
requirement is a long-delayed response to a petition the consumer
group filed in May 1987.
   She said some manufacturers had opposed the idea of including
the NHTSA number in their manuals, saying it would confuse
consumers. Manufacturers also expect problems to be reported
directly to them.
   ``We're very hopeful that this will improve defect reporting,
especially in new vehicles so the agency can catch defects before
we start seeing tombstone technology,'' Ms. Dunlap said.
   ``It's well known that auto defects are radically
underreported,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   US West Inc., six foreign companies and the
Soviets plan to build and operate the world's longest fiber-optic
phone line, a $500 million project that will span the Soviet Union,
officials announced.
   US West, a regional phone company based near Denver, said
Thursday it will form a corporation with the six other firms to
manage constructon of the line, which will have undersea
connections to Denmark, Italy and Japan. The same corporation will
operate the line, said US West spokesman Ed Mattix.
   The 9,500-mile system would include 6,000 miles across the
Soviet Union, basically following the route of the Trans-Siberian
Railroad. The line will connect Denmark and Italy with Moscow, and
Japan to Vladivostok in the eastern Soviet Union.
   Construction would take three to five years and may begin by
mid-1990, Mattix said.
   The seven companies will work with the Soviet Ministy of Posts
and Telecommunications to form the Trans-Soviet Line Development
Corp.
   Construction will begin after the companies and the Soviet
government have reached agreements on a business structure and
received government approvals, he said.
   Western governments now restrict the export of the technology
involved in the fiber-optic line because of its possible strategic
value, Mattix said.
   Governments of the countries involved will review the plans and
will have to approve them before the project could proceed, he said.
   Other companies involved in the venture are Kousai Denshin Denwa
of Japan, Societa Finanziaria Telefonica of Italy, British Telecom
PLC, OTC of Australia, the Deutsche Bundespost Telekom of West
Germany and Great Nordic Telegraph Co. and Telecom of Denmark.
   Fiber-optic cables use strands of glass as thin as hair to
transmit phone calls and data communications in the form of bursts
of laser light. They are far more efficient and handle a far
greater number of calls than traditional copper cables.
   The line would carry international phone calls as well as
long-distance phone calls within the Soviet Union, officials said.
   The project was announced Thursday by Dick Callahan, president
of US West Diversified Group, and G.G. Kudriavtzev, first deputy of
the Soviet ministry.
   Forming the corporation is ``the next step in our efforts to
constuct this major telecommunications link,'' the two said.

   The slowing of the economy has some analysts
at odds over whether a recession is on the horizon and Federal
Reserve policy-makers looking to give the economy a boost without
exacerbating inflation.
   Whether the Fed will seek to nudge interest rates lower again
before the end of the year is the subject of much debate among
financial analysts, and most agree that today's unemployment report
from the Labor Department will heavily influence the Fed's course.
   Financial markets drifted Thursday as most traders awaited
today's data, the first comprehensive look at the economy's
performance in November.
   If job growth was sluggish, the central bank is expected to ease
its hold on credit for the sixth time since March in an effort to
spur the economy. A strong report likely will persuade the Fed to
hold tight and await further data on economic growth and inflation
as the year draws to a close.
   Analysts contacted in advance of the report's release were split
on whether it would bring an easing from the Fed.
   ``It will show that the general slowdown in the economy
continues, and in fact the Fed might want to ease further on these
numbers,'' said Kathleen Stephansen, senior economist at Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp. ``The prime concern has shifted
away from inflation and onto the overall state of the economy.''
   She predicted the Labor Department would report an addition of
120,000-130,000 new non-farm payroll jobs last month, with the
civilian unemployment rate either holding steady at 5.3 percent or
perhaps climbing slightly to 5.4 percent.
   But Roger Brinner of DRI-McGraw Hill predicted the Fed would
``just hold tight'' if the report was in line with his company's
prediction of 125,000 new jobs last month.
   Brinner said the jobs number will be artificially deflated by
about 60,000 because the Labor Department's survey was taken in a
week in which Boeing Corp. workers were on strike.
   ``Our view is that the Federal Reserve is not pleased with
inflation,'' said Brinner, adding that the economy, while growing
at a slower pace, does not appear at risk of toppling into
recession.
   ``We're running in the middle gears right now and any further
downshifts to low, or as some people fear, reverse, are yet to
come,'' he said.
   Concurring with that view was Washington economist Michael
Evans, who predicted the report would show 150,000 new jobs last
month.
   ``I think the Fed is just going to sit tight,'' Evans said.
``The economy has pulled out of whatever was ailing it at the
beginning of the year and inflation is still rearing its head. If
growth and inflation are both up, that's not when you ease.''
   The October report was comparatively strong, with the government
reporting the creation of 233,000 jobs in the non-farm sector. For
the past six months the month-to-month gains have averaged 203,000,
well below last year's average of more than 300,000.
   For the past six months, the jobless rate has changed only
slightly; three of those months it was 5.2 percent, the other three
5.3 percent.

<HEAD>Dollar Rallies Against Guilder in Quiet Market; Gold Firms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The dollar was mixed this morning as a quiet
European market waited for direction from U.S. economic data. Gold
prices firmed.
   Traders said the market was quiet, with most traders waiting on
the sidelines for the release of U.S. unemployment data for
November due later in the day.
   One trader at a large West German commercial bank in Frankfurt
said a rumor today that non-farm payrolls will be up far less than
the expected 155,000, which would be an indication the U.S. economy
is slowing and could prompt the U.S. Federal Reserve to ease credit
policies, pushed the dollar slightly higher rather than lower, as
one would expect on such a rumor.
   ``It's a perverse market,'' said the trader. ``At the moment
every dollar movement is unexplainable.''
   Another trader said the dollar could rise but added, ``We have
to wait and see how the market interprets the numbers.'' Because
volume was dropping with the approach of the holiday, the trader
added, movements could be sharp.
   In Tokyo, the dollar ended the day at 144.27 yen, up 0.14 yen
from its close on Thursday. Later in the day in London, the dollar
was quoted at 144.23 yen.
   The dollar, which dipped below 2.0000 Dutch guilders for the
first time since Jan. 3 on Thursday, trading at a late rate of
1.9963, rallied to 2.0025 Dutch guilders today.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Thursday's
prices, included: 1.7745 West German marks, up from 1.7720; 1.5952
Swiss francs, up from 1.5920; 6.0610 French francs, up from 6.0560;
1,307.95 Italian lire, down from 1,308.00; and 1.1620 Canadian
dollars, from 1.1625.
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.5772, compared to
$1.5750 late Thursday.
   Gold bullion dealers in London fixed a recommended price of
$408.85 a troy ounce this morning, up from $404.25 bid late
Thursday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $408.40, up from $404 bid late
Thursday.
   Gold in Hong Kong rose $2.74 to close at a bid $407.75.
   Silver rose in London to a bid price of $5.62 a troy ounce, up 2
cents from Thursday.

   The key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost
ground today for the first time this week, while the dollar edged
up against the yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average ended the week at 37,724.06,
down 134.05 points or 0.35 percent from its record-high closing of
37,858.11 Thursday. Volume on the market's first section was
estimated at 1 billion shares, up from 944 million shares Thursday.
   Analysts saw the drop as a healthy sign after the market's rapid
gains in recent weeks. ``There are no negatives that should push
the market down. But (the drop in prices today) is keeping the
market developing in a smooth and gradual ascent,'' said Chuck
Lambert, an international equity salesman at Jardine Fleming.
   A salesman at Kleinwort Benson securities said he didn't expect
that the market's recent rally, in which the Nikkei average has
advanced in all but two of the past 22 trading days, had ended
despite today's drop.
   ``It's not time yet to say this rally has come to an end. There
are a lot of people still waiting to put money into the market,''
said the trader, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar ended the day at
144.27 yen, up 0.14 yen from its close of 144.13 yen on Thursday.
After opening at 144.32 yen, the U.S. currency ranged between
144.20 and 144.40 yen.
   There were no strong trends in the market as many Japanese
traders stayed on the sidelines, said Minori Takeuchi, a trader at
Chemical Bank.
   The dollar's higher opening in Tokyo followed an overnight
upswing in New York, where it ended at 144.30 yen.
   Some speculators in Tokyo seemed to be waiting until the dollar
rose more before selling to buy yen, Takeuchi said. Finance
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto indicated a relative lack of concern
with the dollar's strength above the 144 yen level at a regular
news conference this morning.
   ``Inside a delicate situation we are taking a delicate look,''
he said. The remark was seen as indicating the ministry was not
alarmed by the dollar's recent rise.
   Many market players also were awaiting the release of U.S.
jobless figures for November, due out in Washington later today,
traders said.

   The Justice Department's probe of savings and
loan fraud will get 400 more investigators to look into what
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh says may be the nation's ``biggest
white-collar swindle.''
   Thornburgh announced Thursday that the additional prosecutors,
FBI agents and accountants will be assigned to 27 cities where most
of the savings and loan fraud cases are being investigated.
   The additional manpower is being financed by a $48.5 million
appropriation by Congress as part of legislation to tighten
regulations on the scandal-plagued thrift industry.
   ``Wrongdoing in the savings and loan industry may turn out to be
the biggest white-collar swindle in the history of our nation,''
the attorney general told reporters.
   The department's Dallas savings and loan task force, which has
already obtained 46 convictions, will double in size with 37 more
FBI agents and 12 assistant U.S. attorneys, Thornburgh said.
   Asked today on ABC's ``Good Morning America'' to what extent
blame for S&amp;L fraud could be placed on deregulation of the
industry, Thornburgh said, ``I think the type of operator that was
involved in these ripoffs would have not been deterred by the
regulatory apparatus.''
   He said ``the best estimates are that about 25 percent, one
dollar out of four, of the losses that eventually are going to have
to be picked up by the taxpayers was due to criminal activity.''
Overall losses in the S&amp;L industry have been estimated at up to
$160 billion.
   ``I think it would be misleading to think that there will be any
substantial recovery,'' Thornburgh said. ``Most of these funds have
been frittered away.''
   Marvin Collins, U.S. attorney in Dallas, said much of the fraud
in the Texas S&amp;L industry would have happened anyway. ``The cowboys
we prosecuted were going to act without regard to whether there was
regulation,'' Collins said.
   The Justice Department is pursuing about 8,000 cases of bank and
savings-and-loan fraud, ranging from embezzlements by tellers to
fraud committed by top executives, said Justice Department
spokesman David Runkel.
   ``If laws are firmly enforced, they will provide a deterrent to
future criminal activity,'' the attorney general said.
   ``Up to this point, because of the number of cases and the
shortage of resources, we have not been able to mount the type of
effort I have outlined,'' he said.
   In addition to Dallas, Thornburgh announced the assignment of 27
FBI agents and 15 more prosecutors to Los Angeles, 10 FBI agents
and five prosecutors to Kansas City, 12 agents and five prosecutors
to New Orleans, 10 FBI agents and four prosecutors to Oklahoma
City, and 10 agents and four prosecutors to New York.
   Another 27 agents and 14 prosecutors will be assigned to Houston.
   Additional investigators and prosecutors will be assigned to:
Anchorage, Alaska; Atlanta; Boston; Chicago; Cleveland; Denver; El
Paso, Texas; Little Rock, Ark.; Memphis, Tenn.; Miami; Minneapolis;
Newark, N.J.; Omaha, Neb.; Philadelphia; Phoenix; Sacramento,
Calif.; San Antonio; San Francisco; Seattle and Tampa, Fla.

   Stock prices moved higher Friday, regaining ground
as bargain-hunting set in following early losses.
   Dealers said the market focused on U.S. employment figures being
released Friday, but found support at lower levels.
   ``It is as good as gold underneath,'' one dealer remarked.
   Another dealer said market players were waiting for the start of
trading Tuesday of shares in the 10 English and Welsh water
authorities being sold by the government for 5.24 billion pounds,
or $8 billion.
   At midday, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index
was up 7.4 points, or 0.3 percent, at 2,354.1. It initially fell as
much as 9.1 points.
   Dealers reported the market turned up again on bargain-hunting.
   One trader said the market also was helped by a recovery in
sterling over the last few days, heavily reducing the chances that
interest rates would rise again.
   Volume came to 243.1 million shares at midday compared with
324.2 million shares at the same time Thursday.

<HEAD>Intel Ending Silicon Valley Chip Production</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Intel Corp., which has been shifting
production to newer facilities in other states, said it will phase
out its last chip plant in Silicon Valley.
   Intel, Silicon Valley's largest chipmaker, said Thursday it will
stop building microcircuits at its outmoded, 9-year-old plant here
over the next 18 months and switch the building to other uses.
   The change will affect about 400 workers, but the company was
optimistic it could put most of them in other jobs.
   The company says the San Francisco Bay area's high housing costs
are one reason it has been moving production to Arizona, New Mexico
and Oregon.
   In July, Intel took a $17 million charge for closing its plant
in Livermore by the first half of next year, and in October, the
company said it would spend $400 million to build a plant near
Dublin, Ireland.

<HEAD>Midcontinent Airlines Ceases Operations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Midcontinent Airlines Inc., a regional
carrier that had been scaled down since Braniff Inc.'s bankruptcy
filing, has ceased operations indefinitely.
   About 35 Midcontinent employees in Kansas City have been laid
off, Chairman Steve Gillette said Thursday. The carrier had nearly
50 workers in its system, he said.
   Midcontinent had been a commuter carrier feeding passengers to
Braniff flights out of Kansas City International Airport, using the
name Braniff Express.
   Braniff, based in Orlando, Fla., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection in late September _ its second such filing in seven
years. The airline has ceased operations.
   Midcontinent, using a dozen planes at its peak with 46
departures from the Kansas City airport, could not recover from
Braniff's shutdown, Gillette said.
   He said few travelers would be affected by Midcontinent's
shutdown. The carrier has had small passenger loads in its 19-seat
planes since attempting to operate independently. Midcontinent
halted all flights after Braniff's reorganization filing but
started up again using three planes in mid-October.
   With about 15 flights a day to six cities, Midcontinent had
filled only about 30 percent of its seats since restarting,
Gillette said.
   Midcontinent will try to start back up early next year after a
restructuring that will require more capital, Gillette said. The
airline does not intend to file for bankruptcy protection at this
point, he said.
   Midcontinent plans to come back as a regional carrier and serve
Midwestern cities that need more flights to and from Kansas City,
Gillette said.
   He declined to release information about the company's assets or
liabilities.
   Air Midwest Inc., another feeder carrier to Braniff hurt by its
shutdown, has continued to operate and now has about 50 departures
daily to many Midwestern cities.

   The stock market advanced broadly today with a
push from falling interest rates and new signs of sluggish economic
growth.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 13.86 to
2,734.64 in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 656 up, 326
down and 488 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 23.72 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The Labor Department reported this morning that the civilian
unemployment rate increased 0.1 percentage point to 5.4 percent in
November.
   The figures showed an increase of 210,000 in nonfarm payroll
employment, after an October increase in jobs that was revised
sharply downward to 93,000.
   Analysts said that painted a picture of continued softness in
some major sectors of the economy, apparently improving the chances
for further moves by the Federal Reserve to relax its credit policy.
   In the credit markets, prices of long-term government bonds rose
about $5 for each $1,000 in face value, lowering their yields to
the 7.87 percent-7.91 percent range.
   Gainers among the blue chips included American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph, up \ at 44; General Electric, up [ at 63{; Philip
Morris, up [ at 42{, and Chrysler, up { at 19].
   Pfizer dropped 1 to 72{. The company projected slightly lower
earnings for the fourth quarter.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.78 to 193.16. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .71 at 375.80.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 15.99
points to 2,720.78.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4 to 3 on the

<HEAD>FmHA Says Bad-Faith Borrowers Taking Advantage of Debt Restructuring</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs grafs 2-3, The FmHA, with updated number of borrowers.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHILIP BRASHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some financially troubled borrowers who
cheated the Farmers Home Administration avoided foreclosure by
taking advantage of debt settlement measures intended for borrowers
who acted in good faith, officials say.
   The FmHA estimates 330 bad-faith borrowers paid off their debt
or bought back foreclosed farms through provisions in the 1987
Agricultural Credit Act.
   Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., has sponsored a Senate-approved bill
to limit the debt-restructuring program to farmers who acted
properly.
   A General Accounting Office fact sheet given to Conrad last week
lists examples of eight borrowers in one unspecified county office
who benefited from the program despite cheating FmHA by selling
collateral, hiding income or paying other creditors more than
necessary.
   One farmer who is eligible for the program had $91,284 in his
checking account while he was $76,269 past due on FmHA loans.
   ``We're not talking about a big thing, (but) obviously we don't
want those who acted in bad faith to get the benefits of the
legislation, and that was clearly Congress' intent when they passed
the Agricultural Credit Act,'' said Conrad, chairman of the
Senate's agricultural credit subcommittee.
   FmHA would actually lose some money by foreclosing on those
borrowers, but the agency estimates a net savings of $10 million
because other farmers would be discouraged from cheating, Conrad
said.
   ``I think it is really an issue of assuring taxpayers that the
system is going to operate in a way that assures that those who
haven't operated in good faith don't get the benefits of the
Agricultural Credit Act,'' Conrad said.
   The Senate passed Conrad's bill shortly before Congress
adjourned last month. The House has taken no action on the measure,
which is backed by FmHA.
   ``We are in favor of anything that will enable us to collect
reasonable debts on a reasonable basis. That (Conrad's bill) is a
step in the right direction,'' Agriculture Department spokesman
John Kislak said Thursday.
   FmHA is often called the government's farm lender of last resort
because loans are made only to those who cannot qualify at banks or
other commercial sources.
   With loan delinquencies rising in 1987, Congress forced FmHA to
write down loans or spread out payments whenever that would cost
the government less than foreclosure.
   Bad-faith borrowers have taken advantage of a provision under
which farmers who don't qualify for restructuring can buy out of
their debt at the adjusted value of their collateral, according to
the GAO report.
   In one location, borrowers who ``engaged in multiple instances
of bad faith'' bought out their loans that way, the GAO said.
   Another provision bad-faith borrowers have used gives them the
option to purchase or lease land the FmHA took from them in
foreclosure.
   Among the examples of borrowers who cheated FmHA were:
   _A farmer who sold farm equipment that was FmHA security
equipment and had another family member sell additional equipment.
None of the money was applied to the farmer's $626,000 in FmHA debt.
   _A farmer who borrowed money from other lenders for farm
equipment FmHA had told him he didn't need. The farmer repaid those
loans and even made advanced principal payments on them while
becoming delinquent on $187,000 in FmHA debt.
   _A farmer who claimed a son had not made rental payments on his
farm, even though the borrower was current or ahead on payments to
other creditors.

<HEAD>Machinists Say Latest UAL Buyout Proposal Still No Good</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Airlines' machinists, who have opposed
recent plans to take over the airline's parent company, say they
haven't seen anything to change their minds in the latest
management-worker buyout proposal.
   ``The machinists will oppose any transaction that would unduly
put the company at risk as the last proposal did,'' said Brian
Freeman, an adviser to the Machinists union, representing about
25,000 UAL employees.
   Freeman said Thursday that the union would not participate in
any buyout that includes current senior management of UAL
   UAL management has not met with Machinists union leaders on the
new buyout proposal nor set a date for a meeting, Freeman said.
   Although some managers have met with other employee unions,
neither officials at the parent of United Airlines nor leaders of
the airline's labor unions have offered many details.
   Analysts say UAL management is seeking ironclad commitments from
lenders and the company's three major unions before publicly
announcing the particulars of its revised buyout effort.
   But one union official said Thursday the failure of a previous
bid was prompting UAL's discretion.
   The earlier buyout proposal accepted by UAL's board _ a
$300-a-share, $6.75 billion deal involving UAL management, the
7,000-member United chapter of the Air Line Pilots Association and
British Airways PLC _ collapsed in October when lenders refused to
finance it.
   One factor in banks' wariness of financing the deal was the
continued opposition of the Machinists.
   ``A number of people were embarrassed with (the failure) of the
first ESOP proposals. Most of the parties want to avoid that,''
said Carol Holmes, the outgoing vice president of the 14,000-member
United Airlines unit of the Association of Flight Attendants.
   UAL officials presented a revised employee buyout proposal to
officials of the flight attendants' union on Wednesday. Holmes
refused to provide details of the proposal but said she would
outline it for union members.
   Meetings between UAL management and its 70,000 employees will
continue for some time, said UAL spokesman Rob Doughty. He
described the meetings as roundtable discussions, during which
employees are asked for ideas on the buyout proposal.
   ``It's our policy not to discuss matters that would affect the
value or trading of our stock,'' he said, refusing to divulge
details of the plan.
   ``It also has long been our policy not to discuss labor
negotiations,'' he said, noting the proposal addresses some issues
that usually are covered in union contracts.
   Industry analysts say they believe the revised management buyout
plan will value UAL at $210 to $240 a share, or a total of $4.75
billion to $5.42 billion.
   UAL stock traded at $176.50 a share at mid-day today, down 50
cents from Thursday's close on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEAD>`Guaranteed' Investment Contracts Not a Sure Bet, But Record Is Unblemished</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   During recent Congressional testimony that
disclosed private pension fund fraud, many Americans may have felt
reassured because their nest egg is protected in a so-called
guaranteed investment contract.
   Maybe they shouldn't breathe so easily.
   Those ``guaranteed'' contracts, often used as part of 401 (k)
retirement savings plans, are not ironclad. The only guarantee
behind them is the belief that the issuer is of sufficient
financial strength to keep paying the contracts' fixed rate of
interest.
   Despite their name, chances are no government agency would step
in to make good should a sponsor of the contracts, typically an
insurance company, hit the skids.
   Many insurance companies put their money in junk bonds, risky
mortgages and other investments that may give an investor pause.
The degree to which they are involved in risky investments is
reflected in the credit rating they receive from credit-rating
agencies.
   ``Most of the companies in this market we have rated AA or
higher, which would suggest that the guarantee is pretty good _
very good, actually,'' said Weston Hicks, a vice president at
Moody's Investors Service Inc., a credit-rating agency that ranks
companies on a scale of AAA to C.
   But, he said, ``there's really no protection per se'' if a
company issuing a guaranteed investment contract, or GIC, goes
under.
   There has never been a GIC default. But Hicks said there are
differences in creditworthiness that an investor should consider
between an insurance company rated AAA and one rated AA or lower.
   GICs exploded in popularity with the growth of 401 (k) plans,
which are company-sponsored programs that allow employees to put
away a portion of their income in a savings fund and defer income
taxes on it until the money is withdrawn at retirement, when it is
taxed at a lower rate.
   The 401 (k) plans have mushroomed as many smaller companies have
dropped company-sponsored pension plans. These companies say the
federal rules that govern pension plans make them too complex and
costly for small businesses.
   Employees often have a choice of several investment options for
their 401 (k) savings, including GICs and various stock or bond
mutual funds. Many 401 (k) plans spread the funds among several
GICs, thereby reducing the risk to the savings should there be a
GIC default.
   The advantages of GICs are that they pay a steady rate of
interest and the principal is fixed. With some mutual funds
principal can deteriorate depending on market conditions, while the
rate of interest is never guaranteed.
   GICs typically pay interest rates that exceed the yields on
Treasury bills and money market funds by 0.5 to 1.5 percentage
points.
   The total amount of money invested in GICs exceeds $150 billion,
industry officials estimate.
   Hank Madden, an IDS Securities Corp. financial planner in
Jacksonville, Fla., said that ``as tightly regulated as the
insurance industry is,'' investors should have little to worry
about with GICs.
   ``Thus far, the insurance industry since the Great Depression
has had a pretty good track record of making those guarantees come
about,'' he said.
   Even when insurance companies have had financial trouble the
investors holding annuities and other investments in them have not
been burnt, he said, mentioning the bankruptcy reorganization of
Baldwin-United Corp. several years ago as an example.
   However, Hicks said, all is not well in the insurance industry
today.
   ``There's clearly been a deterioration in the insurance
industry's credit quality over the past few years,'' he said.
   In addition, he said: ``The GIC market is highly competitive and
insurance companies are writing this business at quite thin
spreads. In order to make it profitable they have to put a lot of
liabilities on their books.''

<HEAD>Grain and Soybean Futures Drift Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened mostly lower
today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Wheat prices came under pressure from selling that continued
from Thursday's weak close. The market was expected to get some
support from reports that Egypt and the Soviet Union would be
targeted for additional wheat under the export bonus program.
   Good export sales figures, released Thursday by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture, were expected to give support to corn
futures. And reports Spain may be in the market for one million
metric tons of corn also might boost prices, said analyst William
Biedermann of Allendale Inc. in Chicago.
   Soybean futures were under pressure from reports planting is
progressing smoothly in South America, and the existance of
shipping problems along the Mississippi River.
   In early trading, wheat was unchanged to \ cent higher with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.08\ a bushel; corn was \
cent to } cent lower with December at $2.36 a bushel; oats were \
cent to { cent higher with December at $1.44{ a bushel; soybeans
were } cent to 1{ cents lower with January $5.74\ a bushel.
   Livestock futures were mixed and pork futures lower in early
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Pork belly futures were down the limit due to followthrough
selling from Thursday. Analysts also attributed the decline to
disappointment over a lack of government buying in recent tenders
for bellies to Poland.
   The large number of bellies going into storage also is hurting
prices.
   Live cattle were .12 cent lower to .02 cent higher with December
at 75.50 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to .33
cent higher with January at 82.85 cents a pound; hogs were .02 cent
to .52 cents lower with December at 51.20 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were 1.30 cents to 2 cents lower with February at
52.45 cents a pound.
   Livestock futures settled mixed and pork futures were lower in
Thursday's trading.

   Temple Holdings Ltd. said Friday it sweetened
for a second time its hostile offer for Sea Containers Ltd., by
around $20 million to $1.04 billion, and heated up a proxy battle
for control of the shipping company.
   Temple, which began its takeover bid last spring, increased a
previously raised cash offer in August for Sea Containers' common
stock to $70 a share from $63 a share, and for each of its
convertible preferred stock to $112.70 from $101.43.
   A Temple spokesman said the new bid, which was extended to Dec.
22 from Dec. 11, valued Sea Containers at $1.04 billion, up from
$1.02 billion.
   The initial offer in May totaled $824 million, or $50 a share
per common share and $80.50 for preferred.
   Wall Street reacted positively to the latest offer Friday. In
midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Sea Containers
jumped $2.50 a share to $68.75.
   In announcing its latest bid, Temple also said that if Sea
Containers refused to hold a prompt annual meeting, it would call a
special meeting for the purpose of voting on a slate of Temple
nominees to replace the current board of directors.
   Temple Holdings Ltd. is owned by Sweden's Stena Holdings AG and
Britain's Tiphook PLC. Stena already owns about 8 percent of Sea
Containers stock.
   Sea Containers, which is based in Hamilton, Bermuda, and
operates ferries in the English Channel, had no immediate comment
on the latest offer, said Alison Hogan, a spokeswoman for the
company.
   The company has rejected the previous bids, and in August
announced it would forge ahead with a recapitalization plan that
would involve an undisclosed cash distribution and the issuance of
new common stock and other securities.

   Government benefits to elderly and disabled
poor people were incorrectly cut off in more than half the
suspension cases reviewed by the Social Security Administration,
the agency reported today.
   A study found that agency workers were cutting off Supplemental
Security Income welfare benefits without giving recipients adequate
time and assistance to prove their ongoing eligibility for the
program.
   SSI provides a minimum income floor to 4.5 million low-income
aged, blind and disabled people. Maximum monthly benefits are $368
for an individual and $553 for a couple. They will rise to $386 for
an individual and $579 for a couple on Jan. 1.
   The study found that the number of SSI beneficiaries whose
benefits were suspended for failure to cooperate with the agency's
efforts to monitor eligibility rose from 80,000 in 1987 to 105,000
in 1988.
   ``I am appalled to learn that thousands of frail elderly, blind
or disabled Americans were thrown off the rolls for no good
reason,'' said Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., chairman of the Senate
Special Committee on Aging. ``When an SSI recipient is cut off, it
can lead to homelessness, starvation or exploitation.''
   An internal review of 1,293 suspension cases found that benefits
were incorrectly cut off in 54 percent of the cases and that the
suspensions were justified but incorrectly recorded in an
additional 30 percent of the cases.
   Social Security spokesman Phil Gambino said the agency was
``extremely concerned about the findings ... because they do show
we're suspending SSI payments which go to some of the most
vulnerable people, the elderly and disabled.''
   ``This can cause very serious problems for these people who are
living on very limited incomes,'' Gambino said.
   In response to the report, the Social Security Administration in
late November issued a directive to field offices cautioning that
workers ``must be careful to make sure that SSI benefits are not
improperly suspended for failure to provide information.''
   ``Failure to follow these instructions can result in serious
problems for the individuals served by the SSI program,'' the memo
said.
   Employees were reminded that recipients must be given 30 days to
respond to requests for information about their financial status,
and that an extension may be granted to those who have difficultly
providing requested information.
   In addition, the memo said, recipients who have difficulty
complying with the requests because of advanced age, disability or
homelessness should receive a follow-up contact by telephone or in
person before benefits are suspended.

   Overriding British objections, leaders
of the European Community today agreed to open a special conference
late next year to press their plans for a tight economic and
monetary union.
   The decision, on the opening day of a two-day summit in this
historic city on the German border, paves the way for the community
to revise its founding treaty and adopt radical plans that would
lead to a joint currency and European-wide central bank system.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has been an outspoken
opponent of the sweeping proposals to make major changes in the way
in which the nations conduct economic and monetary policies.
   ``But we expected this,'' said a British official, demanding
anonymity. ``It was a low-key discussion and a decision they were
perfectly entitled to take.''
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who had earlier appeared
hesitant under French pressure for an early conference, sealed the
deal when he told his colleagues he would back the 1990 date.
   ``Our essential position (is) that the community must advance,''
he was quoted as saying by French presidential spokesman Hubert
Vedrine.
   ``We must now complete the work in a way that the Italian
presidency convokes and opens the inter-governmental conference in
December 1990. We must take a decision in this sense today,'' Kohl
was quoted as saying.
   Under the community's rotating presidency, Italy will hold the
top spot for the last six months of 1990.
   Italy's prime minister, Guilio Andreotti, said, ``The conference
will be convoked and opened in the second half (of 1990). ... We
don't need to fix the exact date.'' His remarks were quoted by
Vedrine.
   Treaty changes are needed to bring about monetary union under a
central bank and a single currency for the Community of 320 million
people.
   But the issue is controversial with Britain opposing monetary
union and arguing it is premature to discuss changing the treaty
when the EC has not decided on what monetary union means or
involves.
   West Germany urged today that the Community nations yield some
national sovereignty over economic policy to the 518-member
European Parliament, now largely an advisory body.
   British opposition to monetary union is based largely on Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher's reluctance to yield national political
sovereignty to a community-wide body.
   On the summit's eve, West Germany said it did not want to start
the treaty amendment talks in 1990 as French President Francois
Mitterrand is seeking.
   However, France and West Germany appeared to have reached a
compromise: to launch the conference formally in December 1990, but
stipulating it would not start work until early 1991. Kohl had
wanted to defer the conference until after West German elections
scheduled for Dec. 9, 1990.
   At the start of the summit, Enrique Baron, president of the
European Parliament urged the EC to expand his assembly's powers.
   ``The European Parliament must be able to initiate
legislation,'' Baron, a Spanish socialist, told the EC leaders.
   He also appealed for a quickening of West European integration.
``We consider it necessary to accelerate the process of European
unification.''
   Mrs. Thatcher, seeking to focus the summit on the EC's response
to the upheaval in Eastern Europe, was putting forward a new policy
paper.
   It envisages the Community devising relations of varying
closeness with East European nations depending on how far each
advances toward democracy, Thatcher aides said.
   The EC is to become a barrier-free, single market at the end of
1992.
   The summit opened just days after U.S. President George Bush
urged the West Europeans to accelerate integration and to act as a
``magnet that draws the forces of reform forward in Eastern
Europe.''
   The leaders were also debating a proposed Social Charter,
setting out EC-wide labor union rights, wages and welfare after
1992. Britain also opposes the charter, arguing that it will
increase production costs and unemployment and make the Community
less competitive.
   The Social Charter would not be binding. But its adoption goes
to the heart of the political controversy within the EC.

<TEXT>
   Chevron Corp., the nation's fourth-largest
oil company, said today it had sued Pennzoil Co. and taken other
defensive steps following Pennzoil's disclosure it had bought 8.8
percent of Chevron's stock.
   In two other moves designed to deter a possible hostile
takeover, Chevron stepped up its shareholder rights takeover
defense _ which enables stockholders to buy more shares at bargain
prices _ and lined up a new $5 billion credit agreement with banks.
   ``Our board believes that Pennzoil's acquisition of Chevron
shares is disruptive and represents a threat to the realization of
our long-term business objectives,'' Kenneth T. Derr, Chevron
chairman and chief executive, said in a news release.
   Houston-based Pennzoil disclosed Thursday in a filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission that it paid $2.1 billion to buy
31.5 million Chevron shares _ 8.8 percent of the total outstanding
_ over the past three months.
   Pennzoil also said it may spend $500 million more on Chevron
shares, the entire $2.6 billion net proceeds it received last year
in settling a lawsuit against Texaco Inc. It said the purchases
were for investment purposes and had no interest in acquiring
Chevron.
   But Chevron said today it had sued Pennzoil in U.S. District
Court here, accusing it of violating federal securities laws in
failing to disclose important information about its purposes in
buying Chevron stock.
   The suit seeks to force Pennzoil to sell the Chevron shares,
which the San Francisco-based company claims were purchased
illegally.
   Chevron also said it had amended the ``trigger point'' for the
company's stockholder rights plan so it would be activated if
anyone acquired 10 percent of outstanding shares, down from 20
percent. The change is intended to deter anyone from acquiring 10
percent or more of the company without the approval of Chevron's
board of directors.
   Chevron also said it had set up a new $5 billion credit
arrangement with banks in the United States and throughout the
world and that all banks involved have agreed not to knowingly
finance purchases of Chevron stock by third parties.
   ``The Chevron board of directors is committed to fulfilling
Chevron's long-term goals and will take all actions necessary to
accomplish that end,'' Derr said. He said it was in the interests
of shareholders, employees, customers and the nation that Chevron
remain an independent public company.
   Responding to the latest development, Pennzoil Chairman J. Hugh
Liedtke reiterated that Pennzoil's stake in Chevron was acquired
``as a long-term investment and that Pennzoil has no interest in
attempting to take over Chevron. We will of course make an
appropriate response in to course to the litigation filed by
Chevron.''
   Pennzoil's disclosure Thursday deflated the price of Chevron
stock, which had been rising on takeover speculation. Chevron lost
$5.25 to close at $66.75 in composite trading on the New York Stock
Exchange. Pennzoil, meanwhile, rose 62.5 cents to $83.25.
   In trading at mid-day, Chevron was up 37{ cents a share at
$67.12{ while Pennzoil climbed $2.50 a share to $85.75.
   The disclosure ended months of speculation about who was buying
so many of Chevron's shares.
   Industry observers also had been watching closely to see what
Pennzoil would do with its windfall from the Texaco settlement,
which was cut to about $400 million in legal bills.
   Texaco paid Pennzoil $3 billion over Pennzoil's claims that
Texaco illegally interfered in Pennzoil's planned purchase of Getty
Oil Co. in 1984. In 1985 a Houston jury awarded Pennzoil $10.3
billion. Texaco appealed but eventually settled with Pennzoil for
the smaller amount.
   ``This position has been acquired as a long-term investment,''
Pennzoil said. ``Pennzoil has no interest in attempting to take
over Chevron.''
   Only Wednesday, Chevron announced a $1 billion sale of 14.1
million shares of its common stock to an employee stock ownership
plan that could make any takeover more difficult. The stock, about
5 percent of the company's outstanding shares, was added to 11
percent already held by an employee profit-sharing plan.
   Chevron, rich in oil and gas reserves and a high-performing
chemicals unit, had 1988 earnings of $1.8 billion, or $5.17 a
share, up about 40 percent from $1.3 billion, or $3.65 a share, the
previous year. Sales totaled $28.9 billion, down from $29.1 billion
in 1987.
   Pennzoil's main businesses are motor oil and sulphur. It earned
$206 million, or $5.36, on $2.1 billion in revenue in the first
nine months of this year. In the same period last year, the company
posted a $223 million loss before the Texaco settlement, or $5.93
per share, on $1.65 billion in sales.

   The Malta summit not only may have symbolized
another high point in superpower relations, but also was the
pinnacle so far for a tie retailing newcomer to the United States.
   Tie Rack got a pleasant surprise when President Bush sported its
``GlasnostTie'' at a joint news conference with Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev after the talks concluded last Sunday.
   The chain _ owned by a company that bills itself as the world's
biggest necktie retailer _ opened its first U.S. store two years
ago. And it couldn't have hoped for a better attention getter and
the timing was perfect.
   The holidays are the most important time for retailers of any
stripe and ties are a Christmas present standby. Pundits have
predicted this year will be a penny-pinching Christmas as shoppers
hunt for inexpensive gifts, with accessories high on their lists.
   Being able to boast about Bush wearing one of his company's ties
was a welcome change for Roy Bishko, chairman of the British parent
company Tie Rack PLC, who last month had to explain some
disappointing financial results.
   In an interview this week, the breathlessly fast-talking Bishko
brimmed with enthusiasm about his concept of bringing affordable
high-quality neckwear to the masses. His eyes gleamed as he
lovingly displayed the latest designs at a Tie Rack store in
midtown Manhattan, one of 41 the company operates in the United
States.
   ``Ties are important to me,'' Bishko proclaimed.
   Bishko said the idea of founding Tie Rack was borne out of his
frustration at not being able to afford a nice silk tie. Plus, he
thought it was a merchandising mistake for ties to be relegated to
tiny sections in mens' departments of big stores.
   Thus, Tie Rack's compact little stores are located in
high-traffic areas, typically along a route that commuters take
going to and from work, such as New York's Grand Central Station.
   They overflow with a bright, broad assortment, ranging from
funky, bold patterns to staid stripes, starting at around $15 and
going up past $60 a piece. The stores also stock scarves, shawls,
floppy bow ties and other neckwear for women. Silky-textured
polyester scarves can be bought for under $10 while real silk
scarves range from $26 to $150.
   Through an arrangement with the Paisley Museum in Scotland, Tie
Rack has access to old designs and adapts them for neckwear. Its
designers also cull ultra-modern patterns from popular culture,
including Hollywood films, and work with contemporary artists.
   On the Glasnost Tie, presented to Bush earlier this year and to
various world leaders last year, there are miniature reproductions
of American and Soviet flags and a Dove of Peace. The background is
dark blue. Tie Rack commissioned it from London's St. Martin
College of Art and royalties on its sales go to a British cancer
charity.
   Bishko, a South African native who emigrated to England in the
early 1970s, had limited experience in retailing before he founded
Tie Rack in 1981. He was working in property and finance at the
time.
   ``I must say I am self-taught'' in retailing, said 44-year-old
Bishko.
   His specialty retailing idea captivated investors when the
company went public in Britain in the summer of 1987. The initial
public offer of Tie Rack stock drew 85 times the number of
potential takers it could accomodate.
   But more recently investors might consider Tie Rack to be a pain
in the neck. The stock has been trading at around 50 pence a share
lately, down from 1.45 pounds when the stock was floated.
   The stock, which isn't traded in the United States, was battered
last month when Tie Rack reported an unexpectedly poor performance
for the first half of the year. In the 28 weeks ended Aug. 13, Tie
Rack lost 272,000 pounds compared with a profit of 374,000 pounds a
year earlier.
   The cost of U.S. expansion and Tie Rack's slow progress in the
United States were cited as causes of its troubles. In addition to
the United States, the company's 220 stores are in the United
Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, Australia, France, the Netherlands and
Norway.
   Outside this country, Tie Racks typically are operated as
franchises and Bishko said the company eventually will sell
franchises here. Now, all U.S. stores are company-owned and run.
   Bishko said he is undaunted and will continue to try and foster
awareness here of his company, which is billed as the world's
biggest neckwear retailer with more than $100 million in sales last
year. Financial analysts, he said, are too preoccupied with the
short-term.
   Other British retailers catering to small market niches have had
success in exporting their concept here and Tie Rack probably won't
be an exception. Sock Shop stores and Body Shops, selling
all-natural health and beauty aids, both have set up U.S.
operations and found plenty of eager American customers.
   ``We regard America as a long-term investment,'' Bishko said.
``I'm sure the share price will look after itself in due course.''

<HEAD>When In Doubt, Christmas Shoppers Turn to Ties</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Tie Rack Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Giving a tie as a Christmas gift may seem like a
cliche but the Neckwear Association of America thinks knot.
   The holiday season is the busiest time of year for all retailers
and ties move fastest then, too. The Neckwear Association, a trade
group for the nearly $1 billion industry, estimates that 100
million ties will be sold this year in the United States and about
20 million of them will be bought as holiday gifts. ``The fact that
there are that many ties sold year in and year out indicates that
ties are a very popular gift,'' said Gerald Andersen, the group's
executive director.
   Retailers say ties are a good choice because shoppers don't have
to worry about sizes. Ties, retailers say, have one of the lowest
return rates for any apparel category.
   This year, Andersen said, the tie business is expected to be
very strong because ``ties are bolder and more exciting than they
have been in years and consumers are really responding.''
   To help gift givers make the right selection, the association
offers the following tips:
   _Buy one that fits the receiver's tastes, not yours. ``This is
probably the most common mistake in buying a tie gift,'' Andersen
says.
   _Get to know someone's wardrobe before buying the person a tie.
Take note of color preferences and choose a complementing tie.
   _If someone favors a particular designer or clothing
manufacturer, look for a tie of the same make.
   _Consider a person's interests. Ties that reflect hobbys are a
safe bet, such as a tie dotted with tiny golf balls for an avid
golfer.
   _Choose a tie that is in fashion.
   Ties are wider this year, with the most popular widths being 3{
inches to 3} inches. Some designers are moving to a 4-inch shape.
   Popular patterns are bold. Looks inspired by the 1940s and early
1950s as well as European themes are hot. Paisleys in rich colors
are selling well. Silk printed neckwear is still a favorite but
woven neckwear is gaining a following.
   The present ``power'' tie is one with a jacquard overprint,
meaning a design printed on a solid color patterned background.

   The stock market staged a mild rally today with
a lift from falling interest rates and new signs of sluggish
economic growth.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 14.29 to
2,735.07 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 784 up, 621 down and
519 unchanged.
   The Labor Department reported this morning that the civilian
unemployment rate increased 0.1 percentage point to 5.4 percent in
November.
   The figures showed an increase of 210,000 in nonfarm payroll
employment, after an October increase in jobs that was revised
sharply downward to 93,000.
   Analysts said that painted a picture of continued softness in
some major sectors of the economy, apparently improving the chances
for further moves by the Federal Reserve to relax its credit policy.
   In the credit markets, prices of long-term government bonds rose
about $5 for each $1,000 in face value, lowering their yields to
the 7.87 percent-7.91 percent range.
   Gainers among the blue chips included American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph, up [ at 43~; Coca-Cola, up 1 at 77~; DuPont, up | at
121], and Chrysler, up ] at 19\.
   Pfizer, which projected slightly lower earnings for the fourth
quarter, dropped 3{ to 70.
   Tonka Corp. lost 1| to 12[. The company lowered its revenue
estimate for the year, citing slower-than-expected sales during the
holiday season.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.56 to 192.94. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .39 at 375.48.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 108.14 million shares with two

   Fireman's Fund Corp. changed its name to
Fund American Cos. Inc. Friday to erase confusion between the
holding company and its insurance subsidiary and to return to a
name it used 21 years ago.
   The corporation's board of directors decided to retain the name
Fireman's Fund Insurance Co. for the subsidiary, while creating a
separate identity for the holding company.
   ``The Fireman's Fund name originated 126 years ago in insurance.
That's where the name belongs,'' said Jack Byrne, corporation
chairman.
   ``By reintroducing the name Fund American, the holding company
is enhancing corporate identity, allowing the name Fireman's Fund
to be reserved exclusively for our insurance company.''
   The name Fund American was used from 1965 until 1968, when the
corporation was bought by American Express. When the business was
sold in a public offering in 1985, the company established the name
Fireman's Fund Corp. for the holding company.
   Fireman's Fund, which sells property and casualty insurance and
is based in Novato, Calif., is the only subsidiary of Fund
American, a Greenwich-based corporation. It had $3.7 billion in
sales last year.

<HEAD>Rumors Of Increased Sales to USSR Sends Wheat Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures closed mostly higher in
quiet trading Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Wheat prices were higher amid reports that the Soviet Union may
be offered up to 2 million metric tons of wheat under the U.S.
Agriculture Department's export bonus program.
   Under the program private exporters can sell U.S. commodities at
reduced prices to meet foreign competition and collect free
government surpluses as bonuses or subsidies.
   Corn prices were lower despite reports Spain may be in the
market for one million metric tons of corn, said analyst Joel
Karlin of Research Department Inc. in Chicago.
   Reports that the Soviet Union also may enter the market for corn
did little to help corn prices.
   A strong soybean oil market helped lift soybean futures higher.
Prices were helped by reports the United States may assist several
North African nations in buying soyoil, Karlin said.
   At the close, wheat was 1\ cents to 2\ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.10\ a bushel; corn was \
cent to } cent lower with December at $2.36 a bushel; oats were {
cent lower to unchanged with December at $1.44 a bushel; soybeans
were 2 cents to 4 cents higher with January at $5.79{ a bushel.

<HEAD>Boeing Forming Division for New Widebody Plane</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boeing Co. officials announced Friday they are
forming a division to develop a new widebody plane that could
become the 777.
   The new jet will be larger than an existing 767 but smaller than
the familiar 747 model.
   Boeing Commercial Airplanes President Dean Thornton said the
company is going ahead and developing the plane and making first
offers to airlines. But Thornton said no airlines have yet offered
to buy the plane and Boeing is far from committed to actually
building it.
   Neither Thornton nor Phil Condit, Boeing Commercial Airplanes
executive vice president, would say how much it would cost Boeing
to develop the new plane, although Thornton said it would be in the
billions of dollars.
   Condit estimated the new plane would sell for slightly less than
$100 million.
   Speculation about a new Boeing jet model has focused on the role
Japanese companies might have in its development. Thornton said
Boeing has been talking to three Japanese companies, but that no
contract has been signed.
   If enough airlines agree to buy it, the new jet would go into
production as the 777. Until now, talk about such a new jet has
referred to it as a 767X.
   Thornton said the new plane would be smaller and have a shorter
range than the 747 jumbo jet but would be larger than Boeing's
other widebody, the 767.
   Condit said Boeing envisions the plane as having capacity for
about 350 passengers. It initially would be marketed as a
replacement for the Lockheed L-1011 and the McDonnell Douglas
DC-10, which are mainly used on long-distance domestic routes.
   Many of those competing planes have been in service since the
mid-1970s and will be 20 years old by 1995, when Boeing hopes to
introduce the new models, Condit said.
   Boeing later would like to offer an international version of the
777, capable of trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific flight, said
Condit, who has been named general manager of the new division
which will develop the jet.
   Condit said Boeing will use many of its existing facilities to
build the plane but expects it would require a new assembly line,
probably at Boeing's existing widebody plant at Everett, Wash.
   The plane would be a twin-engine jet that Boeing hopes will be
able to accommodate essentially the same two-man cockpit as the 767.
   The seating would range from six to 10 across in two fare
classes.

<HEAD>Consumers Meet with FTC Chairman on Range of Issues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARTON REPPERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Representatives of consumer groups met Friday
with Chairman Janet Steiger of the Federal Trade Commission to
discuss a variety of issues on which they want the FTC to adopt a
higher profile.
   Ms. Steiger, who assumed leadership of the regulatory agency
last spring, said the informal session was intended to sound out
issues of key interest to consumer organizations in the 1990s. Also
taking part in the meeting was Commissioner Andrew J. Strenio Jr.
   Bruce Silverglade of the Center for Science in the Public
Interest said his group wanted the FTC to work together more
closely with state attorneys general and treat the state officials
as ``full partners'' in developing consumer protection measures.
   ``There's enough work for everybody'' at both the federal and
state levels, Silverglade said.
   He added that despite various deregulation moves undertaken
since the late 1970s, ``the American public has never really
supported a broad deregulation of consumer protection.''
   Another official of the Washington-based center, Michael
Jacobson, said the FTC should take a more active role in regulating
advertising by the alcoholic beverages industry.
   He noted that problem drinkers cost American industry about $135
billion a year in lost productivity.
   Jacobson said the FTC should support legislation to require
health warning notices on print liquor ads, equal air time for
public-service messages about the risks of drinking and elimination
of advertising targeted at young people.
   Matthew L. Myers, a representative of the Coalition for Smoking
or Health, urged that the FTC take a hard look at advertising by
the tobacco industry for new products such as no-nicotine
cigarettes and cigarettes designed to produce less secondary smoke
bothersome to non-smokers in the same room.
   Unless such advertising is very closely regulated, Meyers said,
``the American consumer is likely to be misled ... falsely
believing that he or she is avoiding the very real health risks of
smoking.''
   Eileen Kugler, speaking on behalf of another Washington-based
group, Public Voice for Food &amp; Health Policy, said the FTC should
push for measures to to ensure that food advertising _ particularly
health claims made for various products _ is not deceptive or
misleading.
   ``The FTC of the last decade has virtually ignored this crucial
area of consumer protection,'' she said.
   Ms. Kugler noted that ``even as consumers are being told to be
more careful about what we eat, they have less ability to do so. As
consumption of highly processed foods has increased, consumers have
less knowledge and understanding about what is actually in the
food.''

<HEAD>Hilton International to Link Up with Domestic Hilton</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hilton International, a chain of 140 hotels
worldwide, plans to link up with a separate company, Hilton Hotels
Corp., in marketing resorts and airport hotels, it was announced
Friday.
   The program will include joint marketing of resort hotels and
hotels at major airports worldwide, Hilton International Chairman
John Jarvis told a news conference.
   In addition, he said, Hilton International is launching a $17
million advertising campaign and a corporate identity program. The
company also is setting up a new resorts division.
   Hilton International's strategy increasingly will involve the
sale of part of its equity in wholly-owned hotels to outside
investors, Jarvis said, adding that the proceeds will be used for
the company's expansion program.
   Hilton International is a subsidiary of Ladbroke Group PLC, a
British conglomerate, which acquired the hotel division from
Allegis Corp. for $1 billion in October 1987.
   Allegis, now called UAL Corp., sold its Westin Hotels and
Resorts and its Hertz rental car business to other buyers after it
abandoned the idea of operating as a travel conglomerate. UAL is
the parent of United Airlines, the nation's second-largest carrier.
   Nearly all Hilton International hotels are outside the United
States.
   Hilton Hotels, on the other hand, operates within the United
States. The company, based in Beverly Hills, Calif., is making what
it calls a ``slow and deliberate'' effort to sell itself.
   Until now, the only connection between the two companies was the
jointly owned Hilton Reservations Service.
   Hilton International was spun off from the Hilton parent in
December 1964 as an independent, publicly traded company. Hilton
International was acquired by Trans World Airlines Inc. in 1967 and
by Allegis in April 1987.
   Jarvis said Hilton International is not interested in acquiring
Hilton Hotels.

   The dollar ended marginally weaker Friday
against most key currencies after the government reported the
jobless rate rose to a 10-month high of 5.4 percent last month.
   Gold rose in domestic trading following a big advance overseas.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery closed at $411.80 a troy ounce, up $1.80 from late
Thursday. Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for
gold at $411.50 an ounce, up $1.90.
   Currency dealers said the November unemployment data did little
to move the dollar because it was within market expectations,
although some traders were confused by a sharp revision in the
previous month's figures.
   The Labor Department said the civilian unemployment rate
increased to 5.4 percent in November from 5.3 percent in October _
the highest level since January _ despite the addition of 210,000
non-farm jobs last month.
   While the 210,000 new jobs was a moderately strong number, the
government also sharply revised its job growth figures for October
to 93,000 from 233,000.
   ``It's hard to know how much to react to data that's subject to
revisions of that magnitude,'' said Trevor Woodland, a vice
president and chief corporate dealer for Harris Trust &amp; Co. in
Chicago. ``What we got was a mixed bag.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar ended at 144.27 Japanese yen, up 0.14 yen from
Thursday's close. It traded at 144.20 yen in London, and 144.300
yen in New York, down from 144.305.
   The dollar declined against the British pound. Sterling traded
at $1.5793 in London, up from $1.5750 Thursday, and at $1.5825 in
New York, up from $1.5780.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Thursday's
quotes, included: 1.7705 West German marks, down from 1.7725;
1.5970 Swiss francs, up from 1.5900; 6.04885 French francs, down
from 6.0515; 1,304.00 Italian lire, down from 1,307.25; and 1.16225
Canadian dollars, up from 1.16175.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with Thursday: 1.7720 West
German marks, unchanged; 1.5985 Swiss francs, up from 1.5920;
6.0565 French francs, up from 6.0560; 1,306.50 Italian lire, down
from 1,308.00; and 1.1615 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1625.
   The dollar, which on Thursday dipped below two Dutch guilders in
Europe for the first time since Jan. 3, recovered at 2.000 guilders
late Friday.
   Gold soared in London to a late bid of $411.55 an ounce from
$404.25 late Thursday. In Zurich, it rose to $409.25 an ounce from
$404.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold gained $2.74 to close at $407.75 an
ounce.
   Silver prices also strengthened.
   On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery rose
2.1 cents to $5.644 a troy ounce. Silver closed in London to $5.64
an ounce, up from $5.60 Thursday.

<TEXT>
   The former head of a Wall Street brokerage that
collapsed in the wake of the October 1987 market crash was
convicted Friday of manipulating the prices of over-the-counter
securities.
   A federal jury found Eugene Laff, 52, former chairman of Haas
Securities Corp., guilty of five charges _ conspiracy, two counts
of stock manipulation, mail fraud and obstruction of a Securities
and Exchange Commission investigation.
   The case in U.S. District Court in Manhattan was the first
investigation emanating from trading activity surrounding the Oct.
19, 1987, crash.
   Prosecutors had charged that the firm's scheme to artificially
inflate the prices of penny stocks _ inexpensive securites traded
over the counter _ could not be maintained after the market drop
and share prices tumbled.
   Laff, of Greenwich, Conn., faces up to five years in prison and
a $250,000 fine on each of the five counts when sentenced Feb. 15
by Judge Thomas P. Griesa.
   His attorney, John Lang, said he would likely appeal the
conviction.
   Prosecutors said Laff manipulated the stock prices by making it
appear that the stocks were in demand, orchestrating purchases
through accounts controlled by Henry Lorin, the head of a small
investment company, and Stanley Aslanian, a former Haas trader and
president.
   Both Lorin and Aslanian pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate
with prosecutors in the Laff case.
   The defense had argued that Laff was unaware of any scheme to
inflate prices. His attorney blamed the scheme on Lorin and
Aslanian.
   Many of the witnesses during the two-month trial were Haas
customers who testified that they lost their life savings when the
company collapsed.
   Haas Securities was a 75-year-old firm that had 12,000 customers
before going out of business nine days after the crash when it no
longer had enough capital to stay afloat.

   Loral Corp. pleaded guilty Friday to
charges it tried to improperly influence the award of two defense
contracts by obtaining confidential data from key Pentagon
officials.
   Loral, which agreed to pay $5.77 million in fines, penalties and
reimbursement for the cost of the investigation, pleaded guilty to
conspiracy, conversion of government property and filing a false
statement.
   The New York-based defense contractor admitted charging the
Pentagon $578,000 it paid under bogus consulting arrangements to
William M. Galvin, a defense consultant who was actually hired to
influence the award of contracts for a radar detection device and a
Navy blimp.
   Victor D. Cohen, then deputy assistant Air Force secretary, gave
Galvin inside information that was relayed to Loral, according a
statement of facts that the company admitted.
   Melvyn Paisley, an assistant Navy secretary for research,
engineering and systems who went into business with Galvin in 1987,
also assisted Loral's unsuccessful efforts to get the blimp
contract, the court papers said.
   Cohen was to ``personally benefit'' from the information he gave
Loral, according to a description of the conspiracy to which the
company pleaded. Court papers also indicated that Cohen split some
of the money that Loral paid Galvin in return for his cooperation.
   Neither Cohen, Galvin nor Paisley has been charged in the
investigation of Pentagon procurement fraud known as ``Operation
Ill Wind.''
   Loral's guilty plea before U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton
is the fourth by a corporation in the defense-fraud probe.
   Cohen's attorney, Julian Greenspun, called the allegations about
his client ``absolute baloney.'' Greenspun said ``Mr. Cohen never
took a dime in connection with any official action.''
   E. Lawrence Barcella, who represents Paisley, said his client's
actions ``while assistant secretary of the Navy were always
appropriate, legitimate and legal.''
   Through Galvin, Cohen gave Loral details of a competing bid by
Litton Systems Inc., to provide advanced radar warning devices
designed to warn pilots of F-16 fighters that an enemy missile has
been fired against the aircraft.
   Cohen also gave Galvin results of tests the Air Force conducted
on the competing radar proposals submitted by Loral and Litton, the
court papers said.
   Paisley used his official position to help a division of
Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co., which was purchased by Loral in 1987,
obtain the blimp contract, the papers said.
   Paisley changed the bid requirements in accordance with the
Goodyear division's desire to build a smaller airship than the Navy
originally sought. He also made other bid modifications favorable
to the Goodyear division, according to the statement of facts.
   After leaving the Navy, Paisley relayed information he had
obtained from a high-level Navy official that Loral's $140 million
bid to build the airship was 25 percent higher than the proposal by
Westinghouse Corp.
   The Pentagon said in a statement the overall settlement ``will
assure the integrity of the competitive process, avoid substantial
cost to the government and meet the Air Force operational need on
the original schedule.''
   The Air Force, the statement said, considered ``many
alternatives,'' including terminating its contract with Loral, but
that terminating it and starting over `'would have cost $300 to
$400 million and would have delayed the probram by three to four
years.''
   In a statement, Loral said it had suspended two individuals and
disciplined two others.
   The company declined to identify those individuals, but a source
who spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed that Loral had
suspended Louis H. Oberndorf, a senior vice president of its
electronic systems subsidiary in Yonkers, N.Y., and Fred R.
Nebiker, a senior vice president of the defense subsidiary.
   ``This regrettable incident should not have occurred at Loral,''
said Bernard L. Schwartz, the company's chairman and chief
executive officer. ``We are satisfied that Loral has procedures and
controls in place to provide the best protection from anything like
this occurring again.''
   Loral has agreed to give up profits on the basic contract,
originally priced at $43.3 million and will assume a greater share
of cost overruns. The Air Force estimated the changes will save the
government $4.5 million to $6.5 million, the Justice Department
said.
   A $70.5 million option for the 1992 fiscal year is also being
removed from the contract. Loral must compete with second sources
for that procurement, the Justice Department said.
   The company's plea was entered after a former Sperry Corp.
official admitted approving bribes to former Navy procurement
official Garland L. Tomlin Jr.
   James J. Thompson, former general manager of Sperry's
Clearwater, Fla., facility pleaded guilty to conspiracy and bribery
and could receive up to 20 years imprisonment and fines totaling
$30,000.
   Hilton scheduled sentencing for Feb. 16.
   Tomlin, who has returned most of the money he received in
bribes, received an 18-month sentence for his guilty plea.

<HEAD>Burger King Plans Improvements to Counter Slow Sales</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Burger King Corp.'s new owners plan to introduce a
chicken sandwich on an oat bran bun and install new computers in an
effort to boost sluggish sales at the nation's second-largest fast
food restaurant chain.
   The proposed changes were outlined following release of a
financial report Thursday that indicated sales at Burger King's
5,900 restaurants haveincreased 3 percent since Grand Metropolitan
PLC acquired it in January.
   ``The things that need to be done to fix Burger King are not
instant coffee. It's a two-year task,'' said Burger King Chairman
Ian Martin.
   Burger King, which reported sales of $5.4 billion last year, has
average store sales of about $1 million, compared with $1.6 million
per store at No. 1 McDonald's.
   In addition to a chicken sandwich with an oat bran bun, Burger
King plans to introduce about a half dozen new menu items by next
summer.
   Martin said breakfast is an area of particular scrutiny.
   ``There is absolutely no secret that when you look at what
Burger King has done, it has been substandard,'' said Martin
referring to the breakfast offerings.
   Burger King also plans to install upgraded computers at
company-owned stores which automatically track sales, said Martin.
   Grand Met hopes to open 250 to 300 Burger King restaurants next
year and convert its Wimpy's restaurants in Great Britain, Turkey,
Japan and Egypt to Burger Kings.
   Also, the company hopes to install a toll-free customer
complaint and information line next year.
   ``Before one could say they've turned around, you've got to wait
until next year and probably the year after that,'' said Jonathan
Goble, an analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London.

<HEAD>Gloomy Christmas for Eastern Picketers</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A paper route and occasional freelance
photography jobs have hardly helped Adolfo Collazo cover the loss
of his Eastern Airlines paycheck during the 9-month-old Machinists
strike, a fact that has hit like a winter storm with the holiday
season approaching.
   ``This Christmas _ very sad,'' the father of three sons said.
``They know it. I told them, one toy each.''
   Collazo, a ramp service worker with 14 years at Eastern, spoke
about his financial ordeal as he walked the picket line at
Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport. ``I'm still trying to
catch up with my bills,'' he said.
   Money is tight, and tempers sometimes are too, for many of the
Machinists union members who struck Eastern March 4.
   ``If you hadn't worked in nine months, how would you be getting
along?,'' J.D. Filey snapped from within the small rectangle,
bordered by yellow tape, that Hartsfield allows for picketing on
the Eastern concourse.
   Some, such as Filey and Collazo, occasionally have found
part-time work to supplement the $100 a week the union pays for
walking the picket line. Others have working spouses or a decent
savings account balance to help them get by. Some have left to take
jobs elsewhere. Some say they are just broke.
   But the pickets, who have become fixtures this year at airports
served by Eastern, say they are determined to continue their
strike, even though the airline's pilots and flight attendants have
abandoned their sympathy strikes and little hope for a settlement
exists.
   ``We didn't think we'd be out this long,'' said Katie Cantrell,
who was a hangar maintenance worker with Eastern 16 years until the
strike. ``Now, I think I'll be in this box this time next year.''
   Ms. Cantrell and Filey, a 21-year ramp service worker, said
they've had trouble finding work to help them make ends meet.
Employment agencies aren't much help.
   ``Once you put down you work for Eastern, no one will hire you
on a permanent basis,'' said Ms. Cantrell, who has relied on her
husband's salary since the strike began.
   ``They say, `You're going back to work soon.' Here it is, nine
months. That's soon?'' said Filey.
   The strikers' anger toward Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's
parent Texas Air Corp., seems to have turned to frustration at the
federal government and court system, which they say favor airline
management. Eastern sought bankruptcy court protection from
creditors five days after the strike.
   ``The supposed government has done nothing, and after I voted
for Bush,'' said Collazo.
   ``The unity is still here because of the way the politicians
have treated us,'' said Ms. Cantrell. ``Everyone's been bought.
That judge (U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton) Lifland, everything's
gone their way. That's amazing to me. They won't even give us a
spark of hope.''
   Their base of operations is now a dilapidated white wood-frame
house about two miles from Hartsfield. It's been the Machinists'
strike headquarters since a Nov. 26 rock-throwing fracas that
resulted in the expulsion of a union ``tent city'' from airport
grounds. There's no sign of progress in the strike.
   ``We're still out. We're gonna stay out,'' said mechanic Wayne
Macie, who was hanging out at the small house decorated with
anti-Lorenzo signs, a large U.S. flag and a 5-foot-tall Santa Claus
poster. ``The good part is, the guys are hanging together.''
   Macie said it was difficult to explain what has sustained the
strikers through the lengthy walkout.
   ``People who don't know what's going on have never worked for
Frank Lorenzo and his supervisors,'' Macie said.
   Eastern claims it's survived the Machinists strike, partly by
hiring 2,800 mechanics, including 300 union members who have
crossed the picket lines. About 8,500 Machinists, including 4,500
mechanics, went on strike.
   James Ashlock, an Eastern spokesman in Atlanta, the airline's
main hub, said the company is continuing to hire mechanics and ramp
service workers, but that the Machinists would get no preferential
treatment if they came back.
   ``They'd essentially be treated as new hires,'' Ashlock said.
``Quite frankly, a lot of them are not even around. The majority
have gone on to other jobs, including other airlines.''
   But R.J. Lavender, a striking ramp service worker at Hartsfield,
said, ``I figure maybe 80 to 85 percent are still walking the
picket line.''
   At the airport, Filey was asked if his enthusiasm for the strike
might dip with the plunging temperatures of December.
   ``The weather don't have nothing to do with this,'' he said.
``We'll be out here until the bitter end.''

   Cold weather helped buoy heating oil futures
prices Friday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, while crude oil
and gasoline futures finished lower.
   Domestic heating oil for January delivery rose 0.90 cent to
finish at 66.37 cents a gallon after a gain of 1.01 cents on
Thursday. Contracts for delivery through June closed on the plus
side, while those scheduled for later delivery posted slight
declines.
   Analysts attributed the gains in heating oil to strong demand
stemming from unusually cold weather in parts of the United States
and Europe.
   Among other refined products traded on the New York Merc,
wholesale unleaded gasoline for January delivery, which declined
0.36 cent on Thursday, sank another 0.16 cent to 52.65 cents a
gallon. Other contracts closed mixed.
   The January contract for West Texas Intermediate, the main grade
of U.S. crude oil, lost 3 cents to settle at $20.48 per 42-gallon
barrel in fairly slow trading. The contract, which had gained 4
cents in the previous session, traded as low as $20.25 a barrel.
   ``We had good demand to start with and the cold weather just
adds to that,'' said Michael Hiley, energy broker for Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc., of the activity in heating oil.
   Bob Baker, analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., said
barge problems on the Rhine River continued to boost gasoil prices
on European futures markets, which had a bullish effect on energy
markets here. Gasoil is Europe's equivalent of U.S. heating oil.
   Low water levels on the Rhine have created logistical problems
for vessels transporting gasoil to customers and in some cases have
resulted in delays, Baker said. The delays have come during a time
of the year when demand for heating oil is high, he said.

<HEAD>Grain Traders Disappointed By Lack of Increased Business</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Traders have been hoping the Soviets would line up with vastly
larger orders for American grain because of the East-West thaw, but
so far the only people standing in line are the bread buyers in
Moscow.
   Grain prices rallied on the Chicago Board of Trade late last
month on speculation that the Malta shipboard meeting between
President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev would yield
trade agreements, boosting commodity exports to the Soviet Union.
   However, no new trade agreement came out of the summit, and no
announcements resulted from the first round of talks in Moscow on a
new long-term grain agreement between the United States and the
Soviet Union.
   ``There is some disappointment the talks in Moscow didn't result
in some kind of announcement,'' said analyst Susan Leighty of
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York. ``It was expected
that the U.S. would raise the limit on the amount of grain that can
be purchased by the Soviet Union from 16 million metric tons to 20
million.''
   After the close of trading Friday, the U.S. Agriculture
Department announced the USSR will be permitted to buy 20 million
metric tons of grain without seeking prior approval. In October,
the USDA increased the purchase level from 12 million metric tons
to 16 million.
   So far this year, the Soviets have purchased 10.978 million
metric tons of corn, said William Biedermann, research director of
Allendale Inc., a Chicago brokerage firm. He said it's possible the
Soviets will purchase 1.4 million metric tons of corn a month from
March through August.
   Biedermann said what has been disappointing is the small wheat
purchases by the Soviets this year.
   Biedermann noted that during the grain talks, there was
increased buying by speculators of grain futures.
   ``We sold in that,'' he said. ``We felt the retail purchasing
was based on emotion.''
   Ms. Leighty said it is hard to resist the good feeling resulting
from the changes in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, and what
it means to the grain trade.
   ``It is assuming too much to link the grain talks to the
political changes going on in Eastern Europe and the Soviet
Union,'' she said. ``The U.S. and the USSR have long-standing links
in the grain trade. The events don't alter that.''
   What the Soviets want is more liberal credit terms, Ms. Leighty
said. But to get that, they most liberalize their immigration laws
to the satisfaction of the United States. But they failed to do
that this year.
   However, she predicted some kind of accommodation between the
United States and the Soviet Union on credit and grain trade.
   ``But it may not happen until next summer,'' Ms. Leighty said.

   Pork futures were hit hard during the past week, pulled lower by
pork bellies. Analysts attributed the decline to disappointment
over a lack of government buying in recent tenders for bellies to

   The large number of bellies going into storage also hurt prices.
   Live cattle futures drifted during a historically slack time of
retail demand.

<HEAD>Forecast: Japanese Computer Firms Advancing On U.S. Competitors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The top Japanese computer makers are overtaking
their U.S. competitors and that forward march is likely to continue
into the next decade, according to a report by the Arthur D. Little
consulting firm.
   The shift will become apparent in the rankings of the top
computer companies, the report's author, consultant Martyn Roetter,
said Friday.
   Furthermore, Roetter warned that if overseas suppliers become
the major provider of computers and information services to
American businesses at large, it could harm U.S. competitiveness.
   U.S. businesses using foreign computer systems ``will be at a
less privileged customer relationship,'' he said.
   Roetter's report uses his estimated revenue to rank the world's
20 leading companies in the $270 billion information systems and
services industry. He looked backward to 1988 and projected ahead
to 1993.
   Continuing a survey he makes annually, Roetter added two
Japanese firms, Toshiba and Matsushita, to the top 20, joining
Fujitsu, NEC and Hitachi. Fujitsu also displaced U.S.-based Unisys
from the third place on the list.
   The top ranked firms for 1988 were, in this order (unless
otherwise indicated, the firms are U.S.-based): International
Business Machines, Digital Equipment, Fujitsu (Japan), Unisys, NEC
(Japan), Hitachi (Japan), Hewlett-Packard, Siemens (W. Germany),
NCR, Groupe Bull (France), Olivetti (Italy), Apple, Toshiba
(Japan), Control Data, Wang, Nixdorf (W. Germany), Matsushita,
STC-ICL (England), Philips (Netherlands), Compaq.
   Looking ahead to 1993, Roetter forecast this ranking: IBM,
Digital, Fujitsu, Groupe Bull-NEC (strengthening a current
relationship), Unisys, Hitachi, Hewlett-Packard, Siemens, NCR,
Olivetti, Toshiba, Apple, Wang, Nixdorf, Matsushita, STC-ICL,
Compaq, Philips, EDS, Amdahl.
   The study also forecast an overall growth rate among the top 20
of 8 percent to 10 percent through 1993. While respectable, this is
far down from the early 1980s, when growth rates ranged up to 25
percent.
   Roetter attributed his projections to several factors:
   _Impending saturation of the markets for mainframes and
minicomputers.
   _Hesitation by consumers facing too many choices.
   _Lack of technology as yet that will integrate computer systems
so well that users can communicate with each other as easily as it
is to make an international telephone call.
   _Smaller competitors capturing the fledgling business of
software-intensive services.
   Roetter also warned that while many U.S. companies have
succeeded in making their presence felt overseas, some are badly
positioned in the international marketplace, pushing product lines
that are fast becoming obsolete.
   He predicted that stepped up competition will foster more
mergers, acquisitions and close partnerships, with U.S., Japanese
and European firms seeking out partners that will provide strategic
geographic access to markets.
   It was last year that the maturation of the
information-processing industry became more apparent, Roetter said
in his report.
   Most of the firms in the top 20 were troubled by diminished
profits and some lost money.
   ``Many found it necessary to reduce personnel and trim product
lines, and the specter of increased merger activity hung over the
entire industry,'' Roetter said in his report.
   ``Against this gloomy backdrop, however, Japanese companies,
fueled by long-term strategic planning and strength in
communications and semiconductor markets, gained ground on their
European and American counterparts,'' his report said.

<HEAD>Lagging Exports Sends Pork Futures Lower</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Pork belly futures prices plunged Friday on the Chicago Board of
Trade as concern over lagging export sales prompted traders to bail
out of the weak market. Livestock futures also were lower.
   On other commodity markets, cotton continued to lose ground;
grain and soybeans were mixed; precious metals gained and energy
futures were mostly higher.
   Live cattle settled .07 cent to .47 cent lower with the contract
for delivery in December at 75.55 cents a pound; feeder cattle were
.03 cent to .18 cent lower with January at 82.77 cents a pound;
hogs were .30 cent to 1.18 cents lower with December at 50.82 cents
a pound; and frozen pork bellies were 1.85 cents to 2 cents lower
with February at 52.45 cents a pound.
   The belly contracts for February, March and May were down the
2-cent limit Friday as traders liquidated their long positions,
said analyst Paul Hare of Linnco Futures Inc. in Chicago.
   Less than expected government purchases of bellies for shipment
to Poland and sentiment the gains in the pork market during the
past two months was overdone also contributed to the selloff, Hare
said, adding that the brisk pace of bellies into storage pressured
prices.
   Hare said the selloff in pork bellies began two weeks ago after
rumors the Soviet Union may be interested in buying U.S. pork
products failed to materialize.
   Cotton futures declined sharply on New York's Cotton Exchange as
traders reacted to rumors a major cotton merchant was liquidating
long positions.
   Adding to the pressure to sell were expectations the U.S.
Department of Agriculture's estimate of U.S. crop production, due
out Tuesday, will be higher than its November estimate, said
analyst Ed Whitten of Balfour Maclaine Corp. in New York.
   Cotton was .70 cent to 2 cents lower with March at 66.18 cents a
pound.
   Grain and soybean futures closed mostly higher on the Chicago
Board of Trade.
   Wheat prices were higher amid reports that the Soviet Union may
be offered up to 2 million metric tons of wheat under the U.S.
Agriculture Department's export bonus program.
   Corn prices were lower despite reports Spain may be in the
market for one million metric tons of corn, said analyst Joel
Karlin of Research Department Inc. in Chicago.
   Reports that the Soviet Union also may enter the market for corn
did little to help corn prices.
   A strong soyoil market helped lift soybean futures higher.
Prices were helped by reports the United States may assist several
North African nations in buying soyoil, Karlin said.
   Wheat was 1\ cents to 2\ cents higher with December at $4.10\ a
bushel; corn was \ cent lower to unchanged with December at $2.36\
a bushel; oats were { cent lower to unchanged with December at
$1.44 a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents to 3{ cents higher with
January at $5.79 a bushel.
   Energy futures were higher on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Heating oil futures provided the strength in the oil market on
expectations of a resurgence of cold weather along the East Coast.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 3 cents lower to 6 cents
higher with January at $20.48 a barrel; heating oil was .01 cent
lower to .90 cent higher with January at 66.37 cents a gallon; and
unleaded gasoline was .28 cent lower to .10 cent higher with
January at 52.65 cents a gallon.
   Precious metals prices were higher on the New York Commodity
Exchange.
   Concerns about the economy and the possibilty of falling
interest rates sent gold and silver futures higher, said analyst
Fred Demler of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York.
   Gold was $1.80 to $2.80 higher with the December at $411.80 a
troy ounce; silver was 2 cents to 2.1 cents higher with December at
$5.644 a troy ounce.

<HEAD>Expect More of the Same in 1990 Newspaper Earnings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newspaper publishers likely will match this
year's modest earnings gains in 1990 as slow advertising revenue
growth mutes the benefit of cheaper newsprint.
   Analyst projections of earnings growth ranging from 8 percent to
10 percent would mean next year's profits will be slightly below
average for the newspaper business. Earnings gains of 10 percent to
12 percent are the average.
   ``A soft advertising performance and the inability to raise ad
rates much greater than the inflation rate has put some pressure on
profits,'' said John Morton, media analyst for Lynch, Jones &amp; Ryan
in Washington.
   ``What will help is that newsprint price hikes are not likely,''
he said.
   Morton and other analysts say that while their estimates of
overall earnings performance call for little change from the gains
posted in 1989, the pattern will be different.
   They expect weak results in the first half of the year and
stronger gains in the second half, barring an unexpectedly sharp
decline in the level of overall economic activity.
   In 1989, the newspaper business got worse as the year went along.
   ``1990 will almost be the mirror image of this year,'' said
Dennis McAlpine, who follows the newspaper business for Oppenheimer
&amp; Co.
   Revenue growth from advertising continues to be sluggish with
analysts looking for 4 percent to 6 percent growth next year.
   The analysts see signs that ad spending by retailers may be
about to pick up, but they say the outlook has worsened for
classified ad spending.
   Retail advertising accounts for more than half of newspaper ad
revenue, but gains have been limited in the past two years as
stores have restrained their spending because of consolidation in
the retail industry and the problems some new owners have faced in
meeting hefty debt payments.
   ``We are looking for some of those problems to be resolved next
year,'' said Michael Kupinski, analyst for A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc.
in St. Louis.
   On the other hand, classified advertising revenues, which
account for about 30 percent of newspaper ad revenues, have begun
to deteriorate, falling in the past two months from the previous
year's levels.
   Kupinski expects classified ad revenue will decline 3 percent
next year, mostly because of a falloff in help-wanted advertising.
``That reflects a weakening economy,'' he said.
   National ad revenue, which makes up the balance of newspaper ad
revenue, is expected to be up about 7 percent again this year,
Kupinski said.
   McAlpine said the newspaper industry's increased marketing
efforts may lead to a 1 percent increase in circulation revenue for
newspapers next year compared with no growth or slight declines
last year.
   On the cost side, the price of newsprint has been falling,
helping the bottom line.
   Newsprint costs typically comprise 25 percent to 30 percent of
newspaper costs and newsprint prices fell 7 percent to 8 percent on
average this year with similar declines expected next year,
McAlpine said.
   Morton said newsprint prices are falling because of overcapacity
in the newsprint business. He said newsprint suppliers decided
several years ago when prices were rising steadily to build or
expand production facilities, and those plants are now producing
more newsprint than the market can absorb.
   Increases in labor costs are not expected to change much in the
coming year, although some newspaper companies face potentially
difficult negotiations with their unions on new contracts.
   At the moment, the analysts said companies with operations in
the Northeast and Southwest seem to be headed for the toughest
times because of regional economic weakness.
   They said the West and parts of the Midwest should continue to
benefit from relative economic strength.

   Eastman Kodak Co. President Kay R.
Whitmore will succeed Colby H. Chandler as chief executive officer,
the company said Friday.
   Whitmore, 57, will assume his new position when Chandler retires
June 1 after 40 years with the company. Chandler has been chief
executive since 1983.
   Whitmore, who has been with Kodak since 1957, has been president
of the company for six years and an executive officer since 1986.
   Kodak Vice Chairman J. Phillip Samper, 55, who had been
considered a rival of Whitmore for the top job, said he would take
early retirement effective Jan. 1. He had become vice chairman and
an executive officer in 1986.
   Chandler, Whitmore and Samper have ruled Kodak through a
three-man executive council that officials said will now be
disbanded, giving Whitmore sole control of the company. Kodak
spokesman Henry Kaska said the company had no plans to name a
president or vice chairman for at least a year.
   Financial analysts said Whitmore's succession did not represent
a change in policy for the company, which is in the midst of a
restructuring and job-cutting plan aimed at turning around sagging
profits.
   ``Whitmore has been part of the recent direction anyway,'' said
Eugene Glazer of Dean, Witter, Reynolds. ``I don't see that the
course of the company is likely to change.''
   ``A change in the top by itself does not change the fundamental
challenges that Kodak confronts,'' said Mark Obenzinger of Trinity
Trading Co.
   Whitmore said he planned to continue the restructuring plan
begun this year.
   ``We're following a path and I don't think we'll fundamentally
change,'' he said. ``I don't expect the challenges will go away. We
will do what is necessary to be competitive into the future.''
   Chandler said Whitmore has ``solid management experience'' and
is ``fully capable of leading this company forward towards the next
century.''
   Obenzinger said consolidating Kodak's executive control in one
person is likely to speed up communication and decision-making.
   ``A one-stop decision-maker is clearly an advantage for Kodak,''
he said.
   Analysts expressed surprise at the departure from the company of
Samper, who said he was leaving Kodak for a mixture of personal and
business reasons. He did not elaborate on those reasons.
   ``This is a moment for me of considerable emotion _ mixed
emotions _ and gratitude,'' Samper said. ``Kodak is a marvelous
company.
   ``Kay Whitmore has my total confidence,'' he said. ``I leave
without any difference of opinion as to where Kodak plans to take
the company.''
   Samper said he plans to retire to California with his wife.
   ``While we regret Phil Samper's decision to retire early, we
respect his wishes,'' Chandler said. ``He leaves Kodak with the
thanks of us all for his 28 years of dedicated service,'' Chandler
said.
   Kodak also announced a number of other changes made at Friday's
board meeting, including the naming of Wilbur J. Prezzano as
general manager of a new International Group.

   Oil giant Chevron Corp. said Friday it had
moved to thwart buyout threats raised by Pennzoil Co.'s purchase of
an 8.8 percent stake, suing to force the sale of the stock and
beefing up its takeover defenses.
   Chevron, in a U.S. District Court suit filed late Thursday,
scoffed at Pennzoil's claim that it was not interested in a
takeover and accused the much smaller company of plotting to force
a restructuring that would benefit Pennzoil.
   ``Pennzoil is seeking to put itself in the position to purchase
additional Chevron shares cheaply in the future, and to gain an
advantage in any contest for Chevron assets and-or in negotiations
with Chevron's management to force an extraordinary
restructuring,'' the lawsuit read.
   Chevron stock rose 12{ cents to $66.12{ a share Friday on the
New York Stock Exchange. Pennzoil jumped $3.25 a share to $86.50.
   Pennzoil, based in Houston, disclosed in a Securities and
Exchange Commission filing Thursday that it paid $2.1 billion to
buy 31.5 million Chevron shares over the past three months and
might buy up to another $500 million worth.
   The Houston-based company financed the buying spree with a cash
hoard won in last year's settlement of a historic court battle with
Texaco Inc. Pennzoil said in its SEC filing and in a statement
issued Friday that its purchases were a long-term investment and
that it had no interest in taking over Chevron.
   But Chevron, the nation's fourth-largest oil company, in its
lawsuit accused Pennzoil of concealing its true motives and of
violating federal securities and antitrust laws.
   ``Pennzoil has failed to reveal its true intent, which is to
influence Chevron management decisions and-or force an
extraordinary restructuring of Chevron which would provide
Chevron's assets to Pennzoil,'' the suit said.
   The suit accused Pennzoil of violating both disclosure laws
applying to potential takeover bidders and a 30-day waiting period
required before making a stock purchase of more than $15 million.
   Chevron seeks court orders requiring Pennzoil to sell the stock
and prohibiting further purchases without notice.
   Chevron also wants a declaration that its board acted legally in
expanding the company's shareholder rights takeover defense. The
company lowered the threshold at which the plan takes effect, so it
would be triggered once an outsider acquired 10 percent or more of
Chevron's outstanding stock, instead of 20 percent as before.
   Chevron also established a new $5 billion bank credit
arrangement and said all banks involved had agreed not to knowingly
finance purchases of Chevron stock by third parties.
   Chief U.S. District Judge William Ingram issued a temporary
restraining order Thursday evening prohibiting Pennzoil from suing
in any other court over the same issues without notifying the San
Francisco court.
   Pennzoil issued a statement Friday saying its chairman, J. Hugh
Liedtke, ``reiterated that Pennzoil has acquired its stock position
in Chevron as a long-term investment and that Pennzoil has no
interest in attempting to take over Chevron.''
   Chevron said in the suit that Pennzoil has stated repeatedly it
needs to acquire an oil company in order to get favorable tax
treatment of $3 billion it received from Texaco last year. The
money was an out-of-court settlement of a suit Pennzoil won over
Texaco's 1984 acquisition of Getty Oil Co.
   Chevron also said the current Pennzoil purchases followed the
same pattern as Pennzoil's 1988 acquisition of shares in Burlington
Resources Inc. for $380 million. Pennzoil said those purchases were
only an investment, but sold the stock after Burlington filed a
suit similar to Chevron's present suit, Chevron alleged.
   ``Our board believes that Pennzoil's acquisition of Chevron
shares is disruptive and represents a threat to the realization of
our long-term business objectives,'' Kenneth T. Derr, Chevron
chairman and chief executive, said in a news release.
   Pennzoil's disclosure capped months of takeover speculation
surrounding Chevron, which attained its present massive size by
buying Gulf Corp. for $13.3 billion in 1984.
   On Wednesday, Chevron announced a $1 billion sale of 14.1
million shares of its common stock to an employee stock ownership
plan that could make any takeover more difficult. The stock, about
5 percent of the company's outstanding shares, was added to 11
percent already held by an employee profit-sharing plan.

   Domino's Pizza Inc. owner Tom Monaghan
said Friday he may sell the biggest slice of his pizza delivery
business to employees.
   Domino's has retained Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. and J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.
to study the feasibility of an employee stock ownership plan,
Monaghan said in a news release.
   He said he will decide whether to implement an ESOP on
completion of the study, and will remain as chairman of Domino's if
one is adopted.
   Monaghan, 52, said in September he was considering selling
Domino's to spend more time on charitable activities. He founded
the company in 1960 and owns 97 percent of it.
   He has considered alternatives that include creation of an ESOP,
sale to a corporate buyer or taking the privately held firm public
by selling stock, spokeswoman Judy Boulter said.
   Under an ESOP, Domino's would borrow money, lend it to employees
as a group to buy a majority share in the company, and distribute
stock to employees as a benefit redeemable as the loan is paid off.
   Doug Dawson, treasurer and vice president of finance and
administration, has had discussions with employees about the
possibility of an ESOP. ``I think they're very excited about it,''
he said.
   He said it hadn't been determined how many of Domino's
approximately 5,000 full-time employees would be eligible to
participate. The investment bankers would look into that, he said.
   Monaghan has said he wants to spend more time on work with the
Roman Catholic Church and other philanthropic activities, including
Legatus, a group he founded for Catholic chief executive officers.
   Some industry observers speculate Monaghan is considering an
ESOP because of trouble finding outside buyers who are interested
in the company.
   ``The problem is, it's not a very profitable company,'' Milford
Prewett of Nation's Restaurant News, a trade publication in New
York, said this week.
   Domino's, the nation's second largest pizza chain behind Pizza
Hut, reported it earned $6.1 million last year on sales of $2.3
billion.

   They came, they saw, they constructed roller
coasters and water slides.
   Nearly seven years after Disney Co. opened its Magic Kingdom in
Japan, a host of U.S. companies are traveling the globe helping to
bring theme parks and amusement facilities to a burgeoning middle
class looking for a good time.
   ``What's happening abroad is what happened in the United States
in the '70s with tremendous theme park construction,'' said Chris
Miles, design director at HHCP Leisure in Maitland, Fla., just
north of Disney World and other Orlando-area parks.
   ``With Asian countries becoming more affluent and Eastern Europe
opening up, there are significant opportunities.''
   Dozens of projects are under way in Europe and Asia, including
Euro Disneyland in France and Japan's $200 million Space World
complex. Meanwhile, U.S. design firms continue to explore other
proposed ventures, ranging from a water park in Madrid to
futuristic thrill rides in South Korea.
   In Japan alone, spending on amusement parks rose 9.4 percent to
$2.2 billion last year, according to the Tokyo-based Leisure Time
Development Center.
   Theme park industry executives trace the beginnings of the
overseas boom to the early 1980s, when economies in the Far East
and Europe began to improve.
   ``It's a reflection of the economic changes in the world.
Without a middle class, we don't have a business,'' said Hugh
Darley, president of Orlando-based ITEC Productions Inc. and a
former Disney art director. ``It's not the country club crowd that
goes to theme parks and the lower classes don't have the money to
spend. Like in America, the middle class is our bread and butter.''
   Darley said overseas projects comprise 60 percent of clients at
ITEC, which is working on an amusement-retail site in Switzerland
and a marine-mammal attraction in Japan.
   Miles, who helped develop Disney's Epcot Center in Florida, said
his company is involved in developing a sea park in Jedda, Saudi
Arabia; a carnival-type setting outside Istanbul, Turkey; and a
fantasy park in France based on the Smurf cartoon characters. All
are to open in the early 1990s.
   ``In my opinion, the leading edge of leisure technology is going
on overseas,'' said Guy Sutton, executive vice president of
International Theme Park Services Inc., a Cincinnati-based design
and consulting firm that has worked on parks in Singapore, Britain
and France.
   Most industry experts predict a trend toward robotics and
attractions using sophisticated computers and high-definition
television technology.
   At the moment, Miles said the Europeans seem to enjoy more
fantasy- and history-oriented themes, while Asians are dazzled by
scientific wonders.
   ``No matter what is to come, we'll still have to cater to the
individual tastes of the countries,'' said Sutton, who estimated
even a modest theme park costs $75 million. ``You have to make it
comfortable for the local people.''
   Generally, cuisine has the most hometown flavor. In Asia,
vendors offer simple fare such as sausage and bread. The French
prefer croissants to cotton candy, and Spaniards search out their
regular afternoon snacks called tapas.
   In lines, Asians tend to be more patient and comfortable in
confined places, while some Europeans grumble and fidget. Japanese
ride operators are vigilant to tuck in loose-fitting kimonos.
   ``There are a lot of cultural differences,'' said Darley. ``But
when you go deeper you find the 12-year-old in everyone, no matter
if they're Swiss or Japanese. Fun is fun. It's a lot like U.S. film
overseas. If they are good, people enjoy them.''
   The International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions
estimates there are more than 320 parks outside North America,
ranging from dusty midways to the gleaming Tokyo Disney Land, which
drew 13 million visitors last year.
   In the United States, an estimated 254 million people visited
the nearly 600 theme and amusement parks, said Peter Irish, a
spokesman at the Alexandria, Va.-based trade group.
   In Japan, where at least eight major amusement parks are under
construction, the flagship is the giant Space World on the southern
island of Kyushu built by Shin-Nippon Steel, the nation's largest
steel company. The park _ equidistant from Tokyo and Seoul, South
Korea _ will feature a simulated NASA astronaut training camp for
children and a 60-by-90 foot theater.
   Euro Disneyland is scheduled to open in 1992 and other proposals
include a theme park near Lisbon, Portugal, based on the pioneering
expeditions of early seafaring explorers.
   Irish noted that Latin American countries such as Mexico and
Brazil have also increased construction of small amusement parks,
but foreign investors remain skittish.
   ``That's probably the next growth area,'' said Michael Hayes,
marketing director of Cincinnati-based KZF Inc., which is designing
a theme park on the French Riviera and a children's playland at the
Madrid Zoo. ``If there's a time when the economic climate is right
down there, we'll all be looking south.''

   Unemployment climbed to a 10-month high of 5.4
percent in November and manufacturing payrolls shrunk for the
eighth consecutive month, the government said.
   The increase in the civilian jobless rate from 5.3 percent came
despite the addition of 210,000 non-farm jobs last month because of
a big jump in the number of Americans looking for work.
   The 210,000 new non-farm jobs reported Friday by the Labor
Department was in itself a moderately strong number, but the
government also sharply cut its job growth figures for October from
233,000 to 93,000.

significant relaxation of a U.S. ban on high technology exports to
Eastern Europe, Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher says.
   Mosbacher indicated that Hungary and Poland could be two of the
main beneficiaries of such a change. He said in a television
interview that those two countries were discussing with U.S.
officials how to prevent the transfer of militarily strategic items
to neighboring Communist-bloc countries.
   A change in U.S. restrictions would be designed to encourage the
political liberalization in Eastern Europe and to deal with heavy
pressure from U.S. allies seeking an easing of export controls to
the Soviet bloc.

<TEXT>
   Linda Hightower has carried 13 years of
guilt and another five years of anger as a victim of the Dalkon
Shield birth control device.
   Now that $2.5 billion is about to go into a trust fund to pay
thousands of women who were injured by the intrauterine device, she
is relieved.
   ``I felt comfortable once we got the Supreme Court's approval of
the plan,'' said Ms. Hightower, director of the Atlanta-based
Dalkon Shield Victims' Association.
   ``What we're gearing for now is trying to make sure women are
prepared for the process of reviewing their medical records,'' she
said. ``This is the real nitty gritty.''
   The compensation is part of the reorganization of the A.H.
Robins Co., a pharmaceutical manufacturer that distributed and sold
thousands of the IUDs in the early 1970s.
   As of this Friday, Robins will become a part of the American
Home Products Corp. of New York, closing the Richmond-based
company's Chapter 11 bankruptcy case that began in August 1985 when
Robins sought protection from creditors in the aftermath of
thousands of lawsuits claiming injury from the IUD.
   The acquisition of Robins also involves a $700 million exchange
of stock.
   For Ms. Hightower, the Dalkon Shield story began in the summer
of 1971 when she began using the device. Nevertheless, she
subsequently became pregnant, carried the baby to full term but
began to bleed severely during labor. Her daughter was born
brain-damaged.
   At the time, Ms. Hightower did not know the name of the IUD she
was using. She said her doctor told her that problems during
pregnancy resulted from her body's reaction to the IUD and that the
product itself was not at fault.
   Not until 1984, when she read about another woman's Dalkon
Shield lawsuit, did she learn the name of the IUD and that others
had similar problems.
   ``Until then, every time I looked at my daughter, I felt guilty
for what I had done to her,'' she said.
   Soon, however, her guilt turned to anger at Robins. She is
convinced that the company knew of potential defects in the IUD
when the product was put on the market.
   ``To deliberately do something like that ...,'' she said, her
voice trailing off.
   Last month, the Supreme Court refused to take up an appeal of
the Robins' case, rejecting a challenge brought by a group of
Dalkon Shield claimants who wanted to seek additional compensation
from the company's officers and others.
   The decision left intact the reorganization package approved
June 15 by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   John R. Stafford, chairman, president and chief executive
officer of American Home Products, announced last week that the
company would complete the acquisition of Robins, the cornerstone
of the reorganization, on Dec. 15.
   On that day, the Dalkon Shield trust will get the $2.5 billion,
said Michael Sheppard, director of the trust's claims resolution
facility.
   The trust, which is independent of both Robins and American Home
Products, has been working on a packet of information that will be
sent to approximately 112,000 remaining claimants about March 1,
Sheppard said.
   The claimants will have four options, he said _ a $725 payment
for women who do not have major injuries and for which no medical
records are required; a scheduled payment based on the type of
injury and requiring some medical documentation; a full review of
medical records for severe injuries; and a delay in the evaluation
of claims for up to three years for women who used the device but
have experienced no injury or only a slight injury and think the
problem may get worse.
   The trust, which received $100 million in startup money last
year pending the case's appeal, already has settled the claims of
about 80,000 women.
   Ms. Hightower, whose organization's mailing list includes about
1,000 claimants, said every day that the trust has waited for the
full settlement has cost thousands of dollars in interest and
raised the possibility that vital medical records needed by
claimants could get misplaced or destroyed.
   ``Lots of women believe that the trust is going to take care of
them,'' she said. ``The trust is trying to make things simple, and
they're very nice people who are trying to help us. ... But (women)
need to get their medical records, and they should take the records
to an attorney to see what problems they foresee. It's worth $50 to
have somebody look at your forms.''
   Roscoe E. Puckett Jr., a Robins spokesman, said the company will
continue to operate under that name as a subsidiary of American
Home Products after Friday. No decision has been announced on the
role of Robins' executives, he said.

   New signs of economic weakness sparked a rally
in government bond prices Friday, sending interest rates lower.
   The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond jumped 7-16 point,
or $4.37 for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which falls
when its price rises, tumbled to 7.88 percent from 7.92 percent
late Thursday.
   The Labor Department reported that November's unemployment rate
crept up to 5.4 percent from 5.3 percent in October.
   While the report showed nonfarm payrolls expanded by an
unexpectedly large 210,000, it also contained a sharp downward
revision in payroll growth in October, which cheered bond traders.
The number of new nonfarm jobs created in October was adjusted to
93,000 from 233,000.
   Traders have been hoping for evidence of sluggish economic
activity.
   ``The data were viewed as constructive for the bond market,''
said William Sullivan, director of money-market research at Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Each new indication of economic weakness improves the chances
that the Federal Reserve will try to stimulate growth by pushing
interest rates lower, analysts say. Lower rates tend to boost bond
prices.
   Analysts doubt the central bank will make any dramatic moves
soon, however, because some sectors of the economy still are strong.
   By late morning, Sullivan said, it appeared the initial euphoria
over the jobless report was beginning to fade as traders realized
that a shift in Fed policy probably was not imminent.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
government issues rose 3-16 point to \ point, intermediate
maturities gained 5-16 point to 13-32 point and long-term issues
advanced 13-32 point to 7-16 point, according to figures provided
by Telerate Inc., a financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, rose 2.99 to 1,195.08.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds rose [ point to 937-16. The average yield to
maturity slipped to 7.26 percent from 7.27 percent late Thursday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills dropped to 7.82 percent as
the discount tumbled 10 basis points to 7.58 percent. Yields on
six-month bills fell to 7.69 percent as the discount lost 8 basis
points at 7.32 percent. Yields on one-year bills retreated to 7.68
percent as the discount fell 10 basis points to 7.19 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted at 87-16 percent, unchanged from late Thursday.

<HEAD>Fed Approves Fuji Bank Acquisition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Reserve Bank of New York Friday
approved Fuji Bank Ltd.'s request to buy the 75.1 percent of
Kleinwort Government Securities Inc. of Chicago that it did not
already own.
   Fuji Bank bought a 24.9 percent stake in the securities company
in January.
   Kleinwort Benson is one of 44 primary dealers in U.S. government
securities designated by the New York Fed.
   Terms of the transaction were not announced but a Fuji bank
official earlier put the price at about $44 million.
   Fuji earlier paid Kleinwort Benson's parent, London-based
Kleinwort Benson Lonsdale PLC, $14.5 million for the 24.9 percent
stake in addition to $25 million for all of the Chicago unit's
subordinated debt.
   The U.S. central bank voted in August to allow Japanese firms to
continue to act as primary dealers in U.S. Treasury securities.
Primary dealers, which may conduct business in government
securities directly with the Fed, have access to advance
information about note and bond auctions.
   Fuji Bank, the No.3 Japanese bank, with assets totaling the
equivalent of about $351 billion at the end of last year, has six
U.S. branches and bought the U.S. finance company Walter E. Heller
in 1984.
   Fuji bank officials said purchase of the securities firm was
part of a business expansion program in the United States.

<HEAD>Campeau Says Several Parties Interested in Bloomie's _ But Mum on
Who</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The bidding process officially began Friday for the famed
Bloomingdale's department store chain and owner Campeau Corp. said
a number of parties have expressed an interest in buying it.
   Campeau declined to identify the parties, specify how many there
were or how much they would be willing to pay for the 17-store
chain. In a brief news release, Campeau said it ``has received a
number of expressions of interest.'' Friday was the deadline by
which initial bids were to be submitted. Campeau and its advisors,
including First Boston Corp., are composing a list of contenders.
   ``A short list of no more than five or six finalists will
proceed to the second stage of the bidding process,'' Campeau's
release stated.
   The finalists will be given more detailed financial and other
information about the chain that was acquired by Toronto-based
Campeau last year in its $6.7 billion takeover of Federated
Department Stores Inc.
   The second stage of the sale process is expected to take eight
weeks, Campeau said. A definitive announcement on the sale is
expected to be made sometime in February.
   Campeau put Bloomingdale's on the block in September as part of
a plan to cope with a cash crunch. The high price Campeau paid for
Federated, financed mainly with high-interest junk bonds, has been
blamed for the financial woes facing the Canadian retail and real
estate company.
   The plan to sell Bloomingdale's, considered the crown jewel of
Campeau's retail empire, was formed when Canada's Olympia &amp; York
Developments Ltd. agreed to lend Campeau $800 million.
Bloomingdale's had nearly $1.2 billion in sales last year and is
expected to have $1.3 billion this year.
   The head of Bloomingdale's, Marvin S. Traub, has said he would
like to lead a buyout of the chain. Bloomingdale's spokeswoman
Carol Gies said Friday she didn't have any information on whether
Traub had submitted a buyout proposal.
   Traub, the company's chairman, was in meetings late Friday and
was said to be unavailable for comment. He had been in Tokyo
earlier this month during which he said he talked with various
parties that might join him in a possible buyout.
   Japanese news reports have said Tokyu Department Store, one of
that country's best-known chains, was interested in pursuing a
takeover of Bloomingdale's. Tokyu reportedly was willing to offer
$1.3 billion.
   Another party that has publicly disclosed an interest in
Bloomingdale's is Crown American Corp., a privately held company
that is one of the biggest U.S. developers of shopping malls. It
also owns Hess's Inc., a chain of stores.
   The switchboard at Crown American's Johnstown, Pa., headquarters
was closed late Friday and an answering service employee said no
one was available from the company.
   Retail analysts estimate Bloomingdale's could fetch anywhere
from $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. The total could be on the low
side if it included a significant portion of cash, which Campeau
needs.
   The flagship Bloomingdale's store is in Manhattan with branches
elsewhere in New York and in Connecticut, Florida, Massachusetts,
Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia.

<HEAD>Canada Offers $100 Million in Export Credits to Mexico</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Canada has offered a U.S. $100 million credit
line to Mexico through its Export Development Corporation, Mexico's
Treasury Department said Friday.
   The credit will be offered through Mexican banks and is aimed at
small and medium-sized importers, the Treasury statement said.
   The agreement was signed Friday by Treasury Secretary Pedro Aspe
and Canadian Ambassador David J.S. Winfield.
   Aspe praised the move, saying that the credit would improve
relations between the two countries and would contribute to
Mexico's development.
   Canadian-Mexican trade last year heavily favored Mexico,
according to the Canadian Embassy. Mexico's exports to Canada
totaled $1.1 billion in 1988, while Mexico bought U.S. $418 million
from Canada.
   Mexico exports motors, spare parts, gold, copper and petroleum
to Canada, while Canada sends wheat, wood pulp, steel, newsprint
and powdered milk to Canada.

<HEAD>Seidman: RTC Gearing Up To Sale Assets From Thrift Seizures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal regulators are gearing up to sell the more
than 35,000 properties they have received through the seizure of
hundreds of failed thrifts, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
Chairman William Seidman said Friday.
   Seidman, who also heads the Resolution Trust Corp., said about
half of the properties are in Texas and Oklahoma, where much of the
industry's troubles have been located. The RTC is the agency
created to rescue the industry.
   Seidman said an inventory of the properties will be completed by
Dec. 31 _ the first time regulators will know exactly what they
own. The process of selling the property, however, could take time
as some of the assets are tied up in litigation.
   No figures currently are available on the value or breakdown of
those properties, he said. However Carmen Sullivan, who heads the
RTC's Dallas region, said an Aug. 31 estimate valued the land held
at about $3 billion in 8,000 parcels, 1,400 parcels of commercial
property at $3 billion and $748 million worth of residential
property.
   Seidman said the RTC already has sold $2.25 billion worth of
assets from institutions taken over by the government. Those assets
had been carried on the institutions' book at $2.9 billion, he said.
   ``I think we're off to a reasonable start. ... I think (sales)
are going very well,'' Seidman told reporters.
   The RTC currently has about 280 thrifts under conservatorship,
with at least another 300 already insolvent and expected to be
taken over.

<HEAD>Administration May Ease Ban on Hi-Tech Exports to East Europe</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Tops with 10 new grafs providing further Mosbacher quotes, picks
up 8th graf: ``The administration,'' Also moved on general news wires.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is actively reviewing
proposals to relax the ban on sale of high technology exports to
Warsaw Pact countries, some of whom may help keep them out of the
hands of their Communist neighbors, Commerce Secretary Robert
Mosbacher said Friday.
   Mosbacher said the review of current controls on high-technology
products, which should result in proposals for change by April, is
a reflection of the sweeping changes occuring in the Communist bloc.
   ``Everybody is discussing what we should be doing about Eastern
Europe, whether it is politically, economically or
technologically,'' he said.
   Mosbacher indicated that Hungary and Poland could be two of the
main beneficiaries of such a change. He said those two countries
were discussing with U.S. officials how to prevent the transfer of
militarily strategic items to neighboring Communist bloc countries.
   ``Hungary and Poland have talked about giving us additional
assurances about what they are doing with higher technology,''
Mosbacher said.
   A change in U.S. restrictions, still under discussion in several
government agencies, would be designed to encourage the political
liberalization in Eastern Europe and to deal with heavy pressure
from U.S. allies seeking an easing of export controls to the Soviet
bloc.
   U.S. insistence until now on preserving the controls _ imposed
for nearly 40 years by the 17-nation Coordinating Committee on
Multilateral Exports, COCOM _ has been a sticking point in
relations between the Bush administration and its allies.
   ``We will re-look at the (COCOM) levels and probably change the
level of some things approved for trans-shipment to the Eastern
bloc,'' Mosbacher said earlier in an interview taped for public
television's American Interests program.
   The United States is considering ``a shortening of the list (of
restricted items) to those things which are truly important and
essential,'' he said. ``The shortening will be substantial ... that
would be our recommendation,'' said Mosbacher.
   Mosbacher said a final administration decision would be made in
time to present proposals at the next meeting of COCOM, scheduled
for April in Paris. COCOM consists of the 15 NATO nations, Japan
and Australia.
   The administration has been split during the debate over the
liberalization between hardliners, such as Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney who opposes the easing for national security reasons, and
others, such as Mosbacher who deals not only with U.S. allies but
also American businesses.
   Mosbacher said countries such as Poland and Hungary have
promised to allow monitoring to make sure Western technology
exports are not being diverted to other countries.
   ``Those countries who have talked to us about on-site
inspections, they're not doing trans-shipment from their country to
another country ... I think we're going to get a lot better
treatment,'' he said.
   ``Hungary has spoken to us about it; (with) Poland we're in the
early stages of discussions about it and there may be others down
the line,'' Mosbacher said.
   Mosbacher said the liberalization would not apply to the Soviet
Union.
   ``We have a lot of steps with the Soviets before we get to that
point,'' he said.
   The United States also will eliminate the case-by-case approval
required until now to export ``dual-use'' high technology items to
other COCOM members, said Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence
Eagleburger.
   ``Dual use'' refers to technology that can be used for a stated
civilian purpose or refashioned to produce weapons. The United
States has repeatedly clashed with its allies, especially West
Germany, Italy and Japan, over what it argues are violations of
COCOM rules regarding dual-use technology.
   In the latest such case, the administration has accused the
Italian computer manufacturer Olivetti of selling the Soviet Union
computerized machine tools that the Soviets used to make jet
fighter engines.
   Eagleburger said the requirement for individual licenses will be
lifted within six months. He spoke last week in a Washington speech.
   Referring to the question of easing restrictions on exports to
Eastern Europe, Eagleburger said the ``nature of the military
threat faced by the West is changing.
   ``We and our COCOM partners will want to signal our clear
willingness to respond constructively to the democratization under
way in Eastern Europe,'' he added.
