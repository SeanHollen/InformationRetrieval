   Ships and an airplane searched the Pacific 1,150
miles northwest of Midway Island on Thursday for 22 crewmen of a
Taiwanese fishing vessel that sank after colliding with a sister
ship, officials said.
   Four Taiwanese fishing vessels, two commercial vessels and a
Navy patrol plane were taking part in the search for the crew of
the Hun-Kuoa No. 2, which sank after the collision Wednesday, said
David Goff, a Coast Guard spokesman.
   So far the searchers have found no sign of the missing men.
   The Hun-Kuoa No. 1, which was involved in the collision, lost
power and was unable to pick up the crewmen who jumped into the
water in lifejackets when their vessel began sinking, Goff said.
   The Hun-Kuoa No. 1 later got its power back and joined the
search for the missing seamen, he said.
   A Navy P-3 Orion patrol plane from Adak, Alaska, reached the
area at midday Thursday and was ready to drop rescue gear to any
survivors spotted in the water, he said.

<HEAD>Judge Says LA Too Diverse to Consider Porn Films as Obscene</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has ruled that certain
X-rated, sexually explicit videotapes might violate community
standards in some small town elsewhere _ but not in Los Angeles.
   ``There is stuff out there which is apparently accepted by the
community which is far more morbid and shocking,'' U.S. District
Judge David Kenyon said Wednesday in acquitting a video salesman of
racketeering charges.
   Federal prosecutors tried to prove that tapes such as ``Prisoner
of Pleasure'' and ``Kneel Before Me'' could by judged by Los
Angeles standards as patently offensive.
   The judge said that in a small community, perhaps, the videos
could be deemed obscene. But he added that ``the court can't say it
in Los Angeles in this day and age.''
   Attorneys on both sides said the ruling may change the
government's courtroom tactics, allowing films to stand on their
own as evidence rather than calling in expert witnesses to testify
about community standards.
   ``It's an important case and in any future case tried in federal
court, it will be cited,'' said defense attorney Stanley Fleishman.
   The case centered on interpretations of the U.S. Supreme Court's
1973 decision that found that to be obscene, material must appeal
to the prurient interest, depict sexual conduct in a manner that
would be patently offensive judged by the community's standards,
and lack serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.
   Rubin Gottesman, 56, owner of X-Citement Video Inc. and R.G.
Sales Co., still faces two charges of interstate transportation of
child pornography and one charge of conspiracy for selling films
starring porn star Traci Lords.
   Gottesman testified that he did not know Miss Lords was under 18
years old when she made most of her films.

<TEXT>
   Former dictator Hugo Banzer has
demonstrated a lasting, broadly based popularity in his campaign to
win election Sunday to the presidency he once took by force.
   The 62-year-old retired army general is playing to enthusiastic
audiences from all social levels of this poor, largely Indian
nation of 6 million.
   His popularity is a curious phenomenon at a time when
dictatorsip is on the decline in Latin America and democracy on the
rise. He explained it this way in a speech: ``The people have an
instinct that the political hacks have yet to discover. The people
remember the good things as well as the bad.''
   When Banzer was in power from 1971 to 1978, prices for tin, oil
and other exports were high, Bolivia enjoyed economic growth and
its people were working. After his departure came slumping prices,
rising debt, unemployment and rampant inflation.
   During a tour of slums at Santa Cruz, a tropical city that is
Bolivia's second largest, packs of ragged youngsters shouting
``Viva Banzer!'' chased his open car through the unpaved streets.
   He was dressed casually in a sport shirt and waved to cheering
crowds. Mothers held up babies to be kissed.
   The evening before, he attended a crowded fund-raising dinner in
a La Paz luxury hotel, where an organization of doctors, lawyers
and other professionals gave the former general a gold medal
designating him ``Leader of Bolivian Democracy.''
   Nearly every poll shows him leading the field of 10 candidates.
   Banzer finished first four years ago with 28.6 percent of the
vote, but lack of a majority left the decision to Congress. It
chose Victor Paz Estenssoro, who was second with 26.4 percent.
   No candidate is expected to get a majority this time either, but
Banzer hopes to build a large enough plurality to make him the only
possible choice for Congress.
   ``A great economic and social development'' occurred under his
military government, Banzer says.
   After he was forced out of office by popular pressure for a
return to democracy, an economic crisis descended on Latin America
and the good times ended.
   Inflation eventually soared to 20,000 percent a year. Paz
Estenssoro had to adopt drastic austerity measures, including the
dismissal of 22,000 employees of state-owned tin mines.
   Authorities say the austerity program is working, restoring
stability and allowing some real economic growth, but it also has
meant painfully hard times for many working-class Bolivians.
   Nationalist Democratic Action, Banzer's party, promises in its
slogan a return to ``Order, Peace and Work.''
   Opponents and some human rights groups dwell on the former
dictator's tactics while in power. The Bolivian Permanent Assembly
for Human Rights says at least 33 people disappeared and hundreds
were arrested, tortured or forced into exile in a crackdown on
leftists, labor and dissident journalists.
   ``Banzer kept the people subjected, violating the most basic
human and civil rights,'' Rolando Villena, a Roman Catholic bishop
and president of the assembly's executive committee, said in an
interview.
   ``The people are losing their historical memory,'' Villena said
of the public support. The Banzer slogan, he said, ``means order
imposed from above on those below.''
   In campaign speeches, Banzer points out that he did not seize
power from an elected government.
   His coup in 1971 ousted a leftist military government that had
installed a People's Assembly and planned other communist-style
changes. Many civilians, including Paz Estenssoro, supported the
coup.
   Villena said Banzer relinquished power only when forced to do so
by popular resistance, hunger strikes and labor actions.
   ``Democracy isn't a gift of this dictator,'' he said. ``It was
won by the people against his wishes.''
   To such arguments, Banzer responds: ``We aren't trying to
convince our adversaries of today, who only want to listen to
themselves, that we are democrats. ... We know that would be like
plowing the sea.''
   Banzer claims democratic credentials on the basis of peaceful
participation in the process since forming his party a decade ago
and his acceptance of the decision by Congress to deny him the
presidency in 1985.
   His main opponents this time are Gonzalo Sanchez de Losada of
the governing Revolutionary Nationalist Movement and Jaime Paz
Zamora of the Movement of the Revolutionary Left.
   He challenged both to pledge their support to the top
vote-getter, whoever that is. They refused, saying Congress must
retain its constitutional authority.
   A new Congress also is to be elected Sunday.

   Younger served eight years as state attorney general and won the
Republican nomination for governor in 1978 after careers as an FBI
agent, deputy city attorney, city prosecutor, municipal and
superior court judge, and district attorney.
   During his six-year tenure as Los Angeles County district
attorney, Sirhan was tried and convicted for the 1968 assassination
of U.S. Sen. Robert Kennedy. Younger's office also brought the
first indictments against Manson and his followers for the 1969
Tate-LaBianca slayings.
   In 1968, he headed President-elect Richard Nixon's Crime and Law
Enforcement Task Force. Younger was also chief of President Ronald
Reagan's Task Force on Administration of Justice.
   After losting the governor's race to Democratic incumbent Gov.
Jerry Brown in 1979, Younger became a senior partner in the law

   Larry Fleisher, who founded the NBA Players
Association and as an agent represented some of the biggest names
in the sport, collapsed and died Thursday following a squash game.
He was 58.
   A Roosevelt Hospital spokesman said it was policy not to release
the cause of death.
   Under Fleisher's leadership of 26 years, NBA players became some
of the highest paid in sports and gained one of the best free-agent
systems. Fleisher also worked with the league in developing a model
drug-abuse program in which the union participated.
   When Fleisher started the association in 1961, the average
player's salary was $10,000. Under the six-year collective
bargaining agreement he negotiated in 1988, the average salary will
increase to $900,000 by 1993. It is now about $600,000.
   Fleisher operated the union under the title of general counsel.
He resigned last September, and a month later joined International
Management Group as head of its sports division.
   In addition to his union activities, Fleisher represented such
leading players as Bill Bradley, Jerry West, John Havlicek, Willis
Reed, Bob Lanier and Alex English.

<TEXT>
   The nation's flu vaccine will have a new formula,
designed to better attack the flu strains expected to hit the
United States next winter.
   Two of the three virus strains in the 1989-90 flu vaccine will
be different from last year's flu shot, guarding against new
strains of flu, the national Center for Disease Control said
Thursday. The third ingredient remains the same.
   The reason: the three major types of flu virus show what
researchers call ``drift'' from time to time, changing into
different forms that prompt the development of slightly different
vaccines to maintain the effectiveness of the flu shot.
   Last year's vaccine targeted the Type A-H3N2 strain known as the
Sichuan flu and the Type B strain called the Victoria flu; next
winter's shot will go after two new variations: the Shanghai flu an
the Yamagata flu.
   The third ingredient, designed to stop the Type B strain called
the Taiwan flu, remains unchanged.
   ``The prediction is that these (strains) look like the likely
ones to circulate next year,'' said Dr. Margaret Tipple, a CDC flu
specialist.
   Flu vaccine is especially recommended for people who are at high
risk of serious problems if they get the flu, including heart and
lung patients and elderly people.
   The CDC's Immunization Practices Advisory Committee also
recommends flu shots for nursing home residents, people with
chronic diabetes or kidney disease, people with suppressed immune
systems and young people on aspirin therapy, who might develop
Reye's syndrome after a flu infection.
   The CDC further recommends flu shots for anyone who simply wants
to lessen the chance of getting influenza.
   Flu season traditionally strikes during the cold weather months.
The strains being recommended for the 1989-90 vaccine started to
appear in the United States late last winter, and some are now
being seen in the Southern Hemisphere, where the seasons are
reversed.
   ``Those are actually strains that just started to pop up at the
end of the (U.S.) flu season and are circulating now in other parts
of the world,'' Tipple said.

   House Speaker Jim Wright borrowed $100,000 to
invest in a Texas nursing home company in 1983, and lost the money
when the company was liquidated in bankruptcy proceedings two years
later, according to pubished reports.
   Before the company failed, Wright received dividends on his
investment in Jewell Enterprises Inc., although other investors
received none, according to reports in The Boston Globe and The New
York Times.
   Wright's financial disclosure statements list ``investment
income'' from Jewell Enterprises of between $5,001 and $15,000 in
1983. But William Oldaker, Wright's attorney, said Wright also
received $17,000 around the beginning of 1985, The Times said in
its Friday editions.
   Only one other investor, a friend of Wright's who recommended
the investment to him, received payments from the company, The
Times said, citing interviews with 20 of the 27 other investors.
   The Globe reported on Tuesday that Wright borrowed all the money
for his purchase of $100,000 worth of stock in Jewell Enterprises
and used the stock as collateral for the loan. T.R. Jewell,
president of Jewell Enterprises, was also a director at the bank
that lent Wright the money, The Globe said.
   Jewell's bankruptcy made the stock worthless, but the loan still
had to be repaid. Wright also had to repay $13,500 of the dividends
he had received, the reports said.
   Wright finished paying off the loan last June, using some of his
$340,000 profit from a later gas well deal, The Globe reported. The
House ethics committee is looking into the circumstances of the
well venture.
   The speaker is currently defending himself against charges he
broke House rules 69 times over the past decade. The ethics panel
is expected to hold a hearing on the charges later this month.

<TEXT>
   In the town of Kimry, soap rationing began in
April, limiting each man and woman to one bar of household soap and
1} pounds of bath soap in local shops. Not each week or month, but
each year.
   The residents of Ufa, a city of 1 million people in the Urals,
are loading up on salt and matches due to rumors of pending
shortages.
   Sugar rationing went into effect in Moscow on May 1 for the
first time since World War II, and even the Soviet minister of
trade, Kondrat Terekh, has been issued a card entitling him to 4.4
pounds of sugar per month and no more.
   Those tales of consumer woe, and more, were cited in state-run
newspapers Thursday, along with an anguished complaint in the
weekly Moscow News that the Soviet retail trade system, caught
between President Mikhail S. Gorbache's reforms and old iron-fisted
bureaucratic habits, ``is literally breaking apart before our very
eyes.''
   Far from causing store shelves to brim with goods, Gorbachev's
campaign for ``perestroika,'' or economic and social renewal,
coincides with shortages in the consumer sector nationwide, and
some Soviets say the reforms, now in their fifth year, are the
direct cause. Others blame bureaucrats hostile to Gorbachev and his
reform drive.
   ``The feeling is such that under cover of the words `the
inescapable difficulties of perestroika,' shortages are being
created deliberately to indoctrinate this: perestroika on the one
hand brings glasnost, which you can't put into tea, and on the
other hand, a real worsening in the conditions of life,'' wrote
Georgy Afanasyev in this week's Moscow News.
   ``In a word, they're telling us: choose either the old order,
with tea and sugar, or perestroika and just boiled water with
glasnost,'' Afanasyev said. He opted for water and glasnost, saying
the Kremlin's openness policy was a precondition for manufacturing
enough ``tea, sugar and everything else'' to meet demand.
   In a speech last week to the Communist Party's policy-making
Central Committee, Gorbachev acknowledged his reforms had failed to
improve the average citizen's economic lot, and admitted what most
shopgoers already know from bitter experience: Shortages of
consumer goods are not shrinking under perestroika, but growing.
   ``The food problem is far from solved,'' Gorbachev said on April
25. ``The housing problem is acute. There is a dearth of consumer
goods in the shops. The list of shortages is growing. The state's
financial position is grave.''
   The Soviet leader blamed runaway government spending, people who
``forgot how to work'' and top government and party organs _
including the ruling Politburo, which he heads _ for failing to
keep up with the tasks confronting them.
   Gorbachev and other top officials have rejected calls to spend
more dollars earned abroad through the sale of Soviet oil and other
exports to buy consumer goods, saying the money should be spent to
modernize Soviet industry so more better-quality goods can be made
locally.
   But last month, Deputy Trade Minister Suran Sarukhanov told a
Soviet weekly that the equivalent of $8 billion had been added to a
$32.1 billion fund for imports of consumer goods, and that the
Kremlin would buy 15 million pairs of shoes, 300 million razor
blades, detergent, soap and other goods abroad to parry chronc
shortages.
   Pravda, the Communist Party daily newspaper, said the persistent
deficits of consumer goods were why people in Ufa believed rumors
that salt would be in short supply. In the resulting stampede to
the stores, salt purchases recently skyrocketed from the city's
average of 10 tons per day to 250 tons in 36 hours, the paper said.
   A boom in the sale of matches drove daily demand from the
customary 157,000 boxes to as many as 2 million, Pravda said.
   Twenty-six residents of the Krasnoyarsk region of Siberia who
wrote Pravda might well envy the people of Ufa. The Siberians are
forced to bring meat to their village store in exchange for goods,
they wrote, and in such quantities ``that for a family of 3-4
people to get shoes and clothe itself, it needs to give 4-5 cows.''
A sweatshirt costs 220 pounds of meat, they said.
   Pravda said money originally earmarked for heavy industry,
traditionally the priority sector in the Soviet economy, should be
diverted to help meet consumer demand ``and turn the wheel of
economics towards the social sphere.'' But a group of economists
and journalists writing in Moscow News said less government
interference, and not more, was the right recipe.
   The group, called ``Against Inflation,'' said the country was in
the grip of an ``inflationary crisis.'' Economists have projected
the Soviet budget deficit, acknowledged for the first time last
fall after years of secrecy, will reach $162 billion in 1989.
   ``Against Inflation'' said government control over prices should
be gradually lifted, and the mechanism halted that provides
automatic increases in pensions and subsidies as consumer goods
become more expensive. It also called the Gosplan state planning
agency and Ministry of Finance the greatest danger to Gorbachev's
reforms.
   ``What awaits us if the present fiscal and economic policy will
continue?'' the group asked. ``First of all, a total rationing
system for food. Already today, trade is literally breaking apart
under our very eyes.''

   Exhausted by cancer, calamity
and revolution, President Jose Napoleon Duarte struggles to survive
and complete what may be his greatest victory _ peacefully handing
power to an elected successor.
   On June 1, Duarte will hand the presidential sash to
President-elect Alfredo Cristiani of the right-wing Republican
Nationalist Alliance. An adviser said the president ``feels
ambivalent, because he began by taking power away from the
oligarchy and now it may seem he's handing it back.''
   Although the transfer may be peaceful, it will occur in an
atmosphere of civil war, killings by death squads and political
assassinations.
   Duarte spent the past week in bed under an oxygen tent, wasted
by dehydration from vomiting and diarrhea caused by chemotherapy
for terminal liver cancer. He was strong enough Thursday, however,
to rise and receive the credentials of the new Argentine ambassador.
   The president appeared gaunt and stroked his aching throat
repeatedly. He spoke hoarsely but lucidly for 15 minutes,
occasionally sipping water because of mouth ulcers caused by the
chemotherapy.
   ``My government has laid the foundation for democracy in this
country. I have created here a new concept of politics,'' Duarte
said, and cited as his greatest disappointment ``not being able to
leave the country in a process of peace.''
   He is given little chance of reaching his 64th birthday in
November. The former engineer probably will be remembered for a
critical role in gradual and difficult transition from
authoritarianism to democracy, but he approaches the end of his
term and life burdened by failures and compromises.
   Duarte feels he is largely responsible for conditions that make
the peaceful succession possible and sees it as a crowning
achievement. He also considers Cristiani's party, known as Arena,
an authoritarian, anti-democratic movement that may erode gains in
human rights and civil liberties.
   Cristiani said in an interview with foreign correspondents:
``One must acknowledge President Duarte's democratic vocation. He
has ... promoted democracy, but I wouldn't go so far as to call him
the father of Salvadoran democracy.''
   Since terminal cancer was diagnosed last June, Duarte has made
periodic trips to Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington for
treatment. With rest and intravenous nourishment, he has been able
to overcome previous chemotherapy and return to government.
   His doctor, Jose Luis Saca, told The Associated Press the most
recent treatments have been particularly devastating but he is
optimistic Duarte will recover sufficiently to take part in the
June 1 ceremony.
   During Duarte's five-year term freedom of expression and labor
union pluralism have expanded, politically motivated murder has
declined and El Salvador has held three nationwide elections judged
free and fair by international observers.
   His main goals of ending the war and reviving a moribund
economy, however, remain as distant as when he took office.
   Leftist guerrillas have fought U.S.-backed governments for nine
years. They continue to dominate much of the north and east despite
more than $3.5 billion in economic and military aid from Washington.
   Security forces outnumber the 7,000 insurgents 8-1, but rebels
have demonstrated the capacity to attack major garrisons and keep
the army on the defensive in much of the country.
   Recently, in addition to murders in death-squad style, the
attorney general was assassinated and wholesale roundups of
leftists have been conducted. The home of the vice president-elect
was bombed.
   Attacks on prominent individuals appear designed to provoke or
undermine Cristiani.
   Arena and U.S. officials blame the Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front, the guerrilla alliance, but the rebels have not
made targets of high officials in the past. They normally claim
responsibility for attacks and have not done so in these cases.
   El Salvador's economy is a shambles and the country would be
virtually bankrupt without aid. Private investment, living
standards and production of coffee, sugar and cotton, the main
export crops, have declined drastically.
   Health care, potable water and primary education are little more
than dreams to most rural people. Corruption and nepotism in
Duarte's administration are described as widespread or rampant,
depending on who makes the assessment.
   The judiciary is ineffective. While death-squad activity has
declined, political murder continues.
   In his state-of-the-nation address last year, Duarte said: ``The
will of my people has caused me to navigate seas each day more
stormy and more dangerous because of crosscurrents. The absence of
fair winds and persistent adversity all along the route have joined
to prevent us from bringing about our high aims.''
   A ranking U.S. diplomat said Duarte ``didn't work miracles, so
he has taken a lot of knocks, some fair and some not. ... He merged
the party and the government and surrounded himself with some
unscrupulous people, but he must be credited with instituting the
democratic system itself. His great legacy is this transition.''
   The Rev. Ignacio Ellacuria, rector of Central American
University, criticized Duarte for presiding over a military junta
in 1981-82, when death squads and the military were blamed killing
up to 700 alleged leftists a month.
   ``Duarte accepted thousands of murders with the facile argument
that, if he were not (on the junta), there would be more,''
Ellacuria said.
   He agreed that Duarte had fostered ``formal democratic
liberties,'' but added:
   ``He never realized what little real power he had. He's not a
false man, but ... self-deceived. His hands were completely tied by
the United States and the armed forces.''

   Thumbnail sketches of key figures in the
Iran-Contra arms affair:
   RONALD REAGAN _ The 78-year-old former president contends he was
kept in the dark about the diversion of profits from the arms sales
to Iran to help the Contra rebels in Nicaragua. Defense efforts to
compel Reagan to testify in the trial of Oliver North failed.
Robert McFarlane, a former national security adviser to Reagan, has
testified that Reagan personally approved a secret deal to slip
$110 million in extra aid to Honduras as one of several
arrangements with other countries to gain support for the Contras.
Reagan, who called North and told him he was a hero on the same day
North was fired from his White House job, is now living in
retirement in Los Angeles.
   GEORGE BUSH _ The president has repeatedly refused to discuss
his participation in the Reagan administration's secret arms deals.
Documents released at the North trial said then-Vice President Bush
met with the president of Honduras in 1985 to inform him of
stepped-up U.S. aid. Bush has denied ever knowing that money from
the sale of arms to Iran was diverted to help the Nicaraguan
rebels. After the details of the affair broke in late 1986, Bush
said, ``I was not aware of _ and oppose _ any diversion of funds,
any ransom payments or any circumvention of the will of the
Congress.''
   OLIVER L. NORTH _ The retired Marine lieutenant colonel and
former National Security Council aide stood trial on 12 felony
charges in the Iran-Contra affair. Indicted in March 1988 with
three co-defendants, North was tried first. North, 45, supervised
the arms shipments to Iran and coordinated aid to the Contras in
1985-86 when Congress had barred U.S. government help for the
rebels. He went to Tehran in May 1986 on an unsuccessful
arms-for-hostages mission. He was a boxing champion at the Naval
Academy and was decorated for valor during the Vietnam war. North
was convicted of falsifying and destroying documents, accepting an
illegal gratuity and aiding and abetting in obstruction of
Congress. He was acquitted of five other charges of lying to or
obstructing Congress, of lying to then-Attorney General Edwin Meese
III, of converting traveler's checks to his own use and of
conspiring to defraud the Internal Revenue Service.
   ROBERT C. MCFARLANE _ The former Reagan national security
adviser pleaded guilty to four misdemeanor charges of withholding
information from Congress, and on March 3 McFarlane was fined
$20,000, put on two years probation and ordered to perfo00 hours of
community service. The son of a Texas congressman, McFarlane, 51,
val Academy graduate and former Marine officer who was national
security advise3 to 1985. McFarlane brought a Bible signed by
President Reagan and a cake shaa key to Tehran with the arms
shipment in 1986 that he and North hoped to exchange for U.S.
hostages. He attempted suicide in JOHN M. POINDEXTER _ A retired
rear admiral, Poindexter was McFarlane's assistant and successor at
the National Security Council. Poindexter served as Reagan's
national security adviser from December o November 1986, when he
quit as the affair was made public. Heill stand trial later this
year.ter, 52, was a career Navy man d at the top of his Naval
Academy class in 1958 and went on to earn a Ph.D. in nuclear
physics from the California Institute of Technology. His wife,
Linda, is an Episcopal priest.
   RICHARD V. SECORD _ Secord, 56, is a retired Air Force major
general turned arms merchant. He is a West Point graduate who flew
combat missions in Vietnam and ran bombing missions for the CIA
from Laos. The taint of association with ex-CIA agent Edwin Wilson,
later convicted of selling weapons to Libya, led Secord to end a
long, adventurous military career in 1983and open a business with
Albert Hakim called Stanford Technology Trading. When North said he
felt his life in jeopardy from terrorists, Secord paid for a
$13,800 security fence around the North home in McLean, Va.
   ALBERT HAKIM _ Hakim is an Iranian-American businessman who fled
his native country and became a naturalized American citizen after
the shah was forced from his throne in 1978. He had met Secord in
the mid-1970s in Tehran. Hakim, 52, traveled the world from his
base in Los Gatos, Calif., and was considered the money man who
handled the accounts and financial arrangements with the Contras.
   FAWN HALL _ Oliver North's former secretary is co-host with
former baseball star Steve Garvey of a syndicated television show,
``Tickets to a Dream,'' and is writing her memoirs, according to
her agent. She testified under immumity that she helped North
destroy documents and sneaked other papers out of the White House.
Hall, 29, went to work as a secretary for the Navy after high
school graduation in 1977, and became North's personal secretary at
the National Security Council in 1983. She also was a part-time
model.

<HEAD>Goodbye to the Stern Family Doctor with the Amish Farmer's Beard</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   His critics pictured Surgeon General C.
Everett Koop as a national kook when he arrived in Washington. Now,
as he prepares to leave, he has a reputation as a national scold.
   For seven years, Koop, the stern family doctor with an Amish
farmer's beard, wagged a finger and preached good health practices
in direct language that made people squirm.
   He came to office under suspicion from liberals for his
impassioned anti-abortion views, for calling women ``girls'' and
for telling graduating high school seniors that motherhood
completed the ``whole vocation'' of being a woman.
   By the time he announced on Thursday that he will retire this
summer, he had pacified liberals and gained a fresh set of critics
among conservatives.
   Urvashi Vaid, a spokesman for the National Gay and Lesbian Task
Force, said Koop helped educated the country by having ``carved out
a moderate, consensus position on AIDS.''
   But Koop's views antagonized such conservative activists as
Phyllis Schlafly and March for Life leader Nellie Gray.
   Mrs. Schlafly recoiled from Koop's if-you-must-have-sex,
use-condoms views on AIDS and concluded that Koop had become
indifferent to promiscuity.
   Liberal Rep. Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., chairman of the House
subcommittee on health and the environment, said he had been dead
wrong in 1981 when he said, ``Dr. Koop scares me. He is a man of
tremendous intolerance.''
   ``One of the great surprises of the last eight years is how
wrong I was,'' Waxman said Thursday. ``If they could find a clone
of Koop, they ought to appoint him (as successor).''
   And Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., a leader in the liberals'
unsuccessful nine-month fight to block Koop's confirmation, said
Koop had turned out to be ``perhaps the best surgeon general ever.''
   The office gives its occupant the right to wear a uniform as
head of the 7,200-member commissioned corps of the Public Health
Services, but not much statutory authority. An ability to persuade
is the chief source of his power.
   At that, the 72-year-old Koop _ with a square-shouldered
presence and the voice of a prophet _ excelled. He was frequently
on television talk shows, attaining celebrity status.
   In office, he:
   _Issued a surgeon general's report that told smokers they were
addicts, as hooked on nicotine as dopeheads are on cocaine. While
drugs kill 12,000 people a year and alcohol may lead to 125,000
deaths a year, he said, ``My enemy kills 350,000.''
   _Wrote and mailed to every household in America a pamphlet on
AIDS which described in frank terms how the disease is acquired but
drew no moral conclusions. Mrs. Schlafly said Koop's report did not
make enough of a distinction between the use of condoms and
abstinence from out-of-wedlock sexual behavior. William Bennett,
then secretary of education, took issue with Koop's recommendation
that sex education and AIDS education start with young children.
   _Jarred conservatives by refusing to issue a report requested by
then-President Reagan on abortion's psychological effects on women.
He said the evidence was too sparse ``to reach scientifically sound
conclusions.'' Abortion foes hoped such a report would help
persuade the Supreme Court to overturn Roe vs. Wade. An irked
Nellie Gray said it was time for Koop to retire.
   Koop's decisions surprised all sides in the abortion argument
because he had come to Washington as a passionate evangelical
Christian known for praying at the bedside of his young patients
and for traveling the country denouncing abortion as the first step
on a path ``to infanticide, to passive euthanasia, to active
euthanasia, indeed to the very beginnings of the political climate
that led to Auschwitz, Dachau and Belsen.''
   Koop had been a distinguised pioneer in pediatric surgery,
reversing the 95 percent mortality rate on many surgical
proceredures performed on newborns.
   In one celebrated case, he supervised a 23-member surgical team
in an 11{-hour operation that successfully separated 13-month-old
Siamese twin girls.
   He also got rid of X-ray machines in shoe stores that used to
measure children's feet and expose them to harmful radiation.

   Thumbnail sketches of the jurors in the Oliver
North Iran-Contra trial, along with some of their comments when
they were questioned by judge and lawyers before the trial began:
   DENISE ANDERSON _ 34, foreman of the jury and a clerical worker
at a hospital. She lives with her mother whom she refers to as
``news media'' because she likes to watch the news. Ms. Anderson,
on the other hand, said ``I don't like the news'' and when her
mother comes to her room to discuss current events, ``I always tell
her to get out.''
   JEAN I. JOHNSON _ 53, a cashier with a 12th grade education and
a husband who is disabled. She suffers from high blood pressure and
several times during jury deliberations complained of not feeling
well. During the trial, her aunt died, prompting the judge to
declare a one-day recess. She has a son who is a deliveryman for
The Washington Post. North lawyer Barry Simon, who lodged
objections to selection of almost all of the prospective jurors,
objected to her being included because she had read headlines and
was therefore exposed to North's 1987 congressional testimony.
   JUSTINE NEWELL PARRISH _ 39, worked for the Navy 21 years and
said the only thing she heard before the trial about North was that
he was ``selling weapons to the overseas people.''
   DEBORAH GRAY BELL _ 37, a statistician for the Labor Department
who said that when she reads the paper, she focuses on the comics
or the horoscope and that ``I really wasn't interested'' in North's
nationally televised congressional testimony in 1987.
   ERNEST W. NELSON _ 29, an electronics technician who works for
MCI and installs and maintains long-distance communications lines.
Regarding the Iran-Contra affair and North's congressional
testimony, he said that between headlines and TV ``I can't help but
see it,'' but didn't follow it. Enjoys playing basketball when he
isn't working.
   LISA KRISHAWN BROOKS _ 21, a clerk typist at the Department of
Labor, said ``the front page is the last thing I look at,'' and
that she changes channels when the news is on television. At the
time North was testifying on Capitol Hill in 1987, she said, she
was going to clerk-typist school by day and working in the evening.
All she remembered of North's congressional appearance was
``something about a woman.''
   PATRICIA BENNETT _ 39, an unemployed former office manager of an
advertising firm. She said she thinks she heard that North was
``selling something to Iran,'' recalled something about shredding,
and that she saw him on television ``going in and out of
buildings'' but didn't watch any of his congressional testimony in
1987. ``It didn't interest me that much.'' North's attorneys
objected to her selection, saying she read the paper and ``could
not miss headlines.''
   CASWELL GILBERT HARTRIDGE _ 61, a tow-truck driver who said that
in connection with North and the Iran-Contra affair, ``whatever I
heard I didn't understand.''
   BEVERLY TURNER _ 37, a typist in the Army chaplains' office at
the Pentagon who worked for the government 17{ years. She said she
knows only that North is ``the head of soldiers that went to Iran
or something like that.''
   HELEN GINA LYNCH _ 37, a pathology lab technician at George
Washington University. She said she heard that North ``shredded
some papers ... that's all I know.'' Her husband is a mental health
counselor at St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington.
   EARL F. WILLIAMS _ 64, unemployed, served in Patton's 3rd Army
in World War II. His last job was as a security guard and he
formerly was a messenger for the State Department. He said ``I sure
would try'' to be fair to North and that his knowledge was limited
to seeing North's picture on the front page of the newspaper.
   TARA LEIGH KING _ 34, a Xerox operator who said ``I don't
remember'' anything about North's nationally televised appearance
in which he gave immunized testimony to Congress.

<HEAD>Baker: Soviet Promises Must Be Tested</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III,
offering the broadest view yet of how the Bush administration will
deal with the Soviet Union, says the United States plans to test
Moscow ``again and again'' to see whether it will live up to its
promises of reform.
   ``By testing Moscow across the board ... we can see whether the
`new thinking' is real once we get beyond the slogans,'' Baker said
in a speech on Thursday to the Center for Strategic and
International Studies.
   Baker departs Monday for his first round of talks with Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev and Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
in Moscow.
   At the May 10-11 session, they are expected to set a date for
the resumption of negotiations to reduce long-range nuclear
missiles and make preliminary arrangements for a summit between
Gorbachev and President Bush.
   The trip comes amid a dispute in the NATO alliance as the United
States struggles with its allies about forging a strategy to deal
with Gorbachev's arms control initiatives.
   A senior administration official, speaking with reporters about
the speech on condition he not be identified, said Baker's speech
Thursday was intended as a ``conceptual framework'' for the
superpower relationship.
   Baker said it isn't clear yet whether Gorbachev will be
successful with his ``perestroika,'' or ``new thinking'' on matters
of democratization and reform.
   And, he complained, much of the Soviet rhetoric doesn't match
Soviet deeds.
   As an example, he cited Soviet actions in Central America,
``where the Soviets sent over $500 million in aid to the
Sandinistas last year.''
   Baker applauded moves such as the withdrawal of troops from
Afghanistan and the agreement banning all U.S. and Soviet
intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Europe. But he complained
about Soviet shipments of long-range bombers to Libya's Moammar
Khadafy, Soviet military support of militant North Korea and the
Soviet occupation of Japan's Northern Territories.
   Taking note of Gorbachev's offers to make unilateral troop
reductions and make cuts in his defense budget, Baker also said
some 3,500 new Soviet tanks continue to roll off the production
lines.
   The secretary faulted the Soviets for failing to publish ``a
real defense budget,'' one that would allow an independent
evaluation of Gorbachev's pledge to slash his military spending by
14 percent.
   He complained that while there has been talk of a ``common
European home,'' the Berlin Wall still stands and the Brezhnev
Doctrine, which affirms the right to send Soviet troops into other
East European countries, has not been repealed.
   The speech marked the most detailed exposition yet of the Bush
administration's emerging policy toward the Soviets, after a
lengthy review that some critics say has stalled progress on arms
negotiations. Bush, who has defended the review as part of a
``prudent'' transition from the Reagan administration, plans to
outline his views in a series of upcoming university commencement
speeches, the White House said this week.
   Baker said he intends to use the Moscow visit to broaden the
U.S.-Soviet agenda to include issues such as terrorism, the
environment and drug abuse.
   ``Our policy must be to press forward with our agenda, to test
the application of Soviet `new thinking' again and again,'' he said.

   ``Welcome aboard Metro. Sorry we don't serve
coffee and doughnuts.''
   That cheery greeting from a Metro subway operator, booming from
his train's public address speakers one recent Monday morning, drew
rueful smiles from suburban commuters lurching shoulder-to-shoulder
toward the start of another week in their downtown offices.
   Shove a microphone in front of some people and they can't resist
hamming it up. There's something about an open mike in the front
cab of a commuter train, pulling a captive audience of several
hundred passengers, that tempts subway operators to become amateur
comedians and tour guides.
   Officials of Washington's 70-mile Metro subway system frown on
this light-hearted ad-libbing, but most passengers seem to enjoy it.
   ``Welcome, all first-time riders and visitors to Washington,''
said one operator as his train swooped down from the Virginia river
bank toward the District of Columbia. ``You are now 35 feet below
the Potomac River, so hold your breath!''
   Another: ``The next station is Smithsonian, home of the world's
largest flying dinosaur.'' Passengers laughed and applauded when
another announced the train's approach to George Washington
University and _ his voice dropping to an ominous Boris Karloff
bass _ ``FOG-GY BOT-TOM.''
   One operator on the Yellow Line route heading south across the
wide Potomac notes that ``this is NOT the place where George
Washington threw the dollar across the river.'' He points out the
Jefferson Memorial's cherry blossoms and the Pentagon (``the
world's biggest office building''), and tells bad jokes all the way
into suburban Alexandria, Va.
   When his train suddenly filled up with boisterous teen-age
tourists, one operator made his customary announcement that ``the
doors will openon the right'' at the next station's platform. Then
he added: ``For tourists, the doors will open on the left.''
   Metro spokeswoman Mary Bucklew says that among the transit
system's 345 subway operators who haul passengers on more than
500,000 trips each day, only a handful of those at the controls
indulge in good-humored patter.
   They get a mixed reaction from passengers, she said.
   Most complaints come from people who, ``if they've had a rough
day _ or plan to have one _ a little humor might hit them the wrong
way,'' Ms. Bucklew said.
   ``It's like art,'' she said. ``Some people find it entertaining,
others find it irritating. We ask the operators to stick to the
script, so to speak.''
   The 10-week training course for new subway operators includes
three days of special coaching, with rehearsals using tape
recorders, on making a few standard announcements over their
microphones.
   These include identifying which line the train is traveling _
Orange, Blue, Red or Yellow _ and its final destination, giving the
correct name of each approaching station and noting whether the
doors will open on the right or left, plus occasional safety
reminders.
   ``We neither encourage nor condone going off on their own as
comics or tour guides,'' said Jim Winn, Metro's acting general
superintendent for rail operator training.
   But operators aren't reprimanded unless their off-the-cuff
remarks are rude, vulgar or inappropriate. Metro officials say many
tourists appreciate being told which station is close to the sights
they want to see.
   Only one operator, accused of ``just being too exuberant,'' has
ever been admonished to tone down his act, Ms. Bucklew said.
   Hezekiah A. Briscoe, an 11-year Metro veteran as subway operator
and training supervisor, says he plays the straight man while he's
behind his train's controls. But he doesn't mind when his
colleagues try to lighten their passengers' load.
   ``Sometimes a little humor goes a long way,'' he said,
``especially when it's Friday afternoon.''

   Here is a summary of evidence in the trial of
Oliver L. North and the disposition of each charge:
   Counts 1-4: Obstruction and making false statements in September
and October 1985 in connection with letters to Congress denying
that the National Security Council staff was assisting the Contras.
   Count 1, obstruction. Not guilty: Former National Security
Adviser Robert McFarlane testified that North was the source of
false information in the letters. But McFarlane blamed himself, not
North, saying the aide ``was probably trying to protect me.''
McFarlane signed the letters and later pleaded guilty to
withholding information from Congress.
   North testified that he unsuccessfully sought to have the Reagan
administration invoke executive privilege and refuse to answer the
congressional inquiries.
   The letter to then-House Intelligence Committee chairman Lee
Hamilton said that ``we did not solicit funds or other support. ...
We did not offer tactical advice'' to the Contras.
   A fund-raiser for the Contras, Carl ``Spitz'' Channell,
testified that on Sept. 11, 1985, North, after describing the
rebels' military needs, told billionaire Nelson Bunker Hunt, ``I
don't care if I have to go to jail for this. I don't care if I have
to lie to Congress about this.'' Hunt later contributed more than
half a million dollars to the Contra cause. The conversation was
six days after the letter to Hamilton and a day before another
false letter was sent to then-Rep. Michael Barnes denying the NSC
was assisting the Contras.
   North testified he never solicited money for the Contras, that
instead he gave numerous talks to prospective donors and then would
leave before Channell asked for money.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Count 2, false statements to Congress in connection with the
Sept. 5, 1985, letter to Hamilton. Not guilty:
   North testified he prepared only two innocuous paragraphs of the
letter to Hamilton. North acknowledged under cross-examination that
he edited the letter but said he had no authority to make
substantive changes.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Count 3, false statements to Congress in connection with the
Sept. 12, 1985, letter to Barnes. Not guilty:
   North testified he had nothing to do with the Barnes letter. An
FBI agent testified that a draft of the response to Barnes was
found in North's office.

</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Count 4, false statements to Congress in connection with a
letter responding to congressional followup questions from Hamilton
on Oct. 7, 1985. Not guilty:
   North testified that his answers were based on information
McFarlane provided. A note by the NSC's legal counsel said that
McFarlane was taking complete charge of the job of responding to
the inquiries.
   Daniel Conrad, the liaison between North and a private
fund-raising operation for the Contras, testified that North voiced
irritation in a meeting in the fall of 1985 about having to answer
``asinine questions'' from Congress.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Count 5, obstructing a proposed congressional inquiry on Aug. 6,
1986, by denying giving military advice to the Contras. Not guilty:
   North admitted he told lies in his meeting with the House
Intelligence Committee. After the meeting, then-National Security
Adviser John Poindexter sent him a note saying, ``Well done.''
North said he told Poindexter beforehand it would be unwise to meet
with the committee but that Poindexter insisted he do so.
   The key question was whether North lied to prevent a pending
resolution of inquiry into the Contra matter from passing in the
House. Only sketchy notes were taken at the meeting in the White
House, and no transcript was kept. The judge told the jury to note
that ``there is conflicting evidence as to whether or not the
resolution was or was not pending'' and that jurors had to decide
whether the meeting with North was designed to gather material for
the resolution.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Count 6, aiding and abetting obstruction of Congress in November
1986 in the preparation of a false and misleading chronology saying
that no one in the U.S. government knew until January 1986 that a
CIA-assisted shipment from Israel to Iran in November 1985
contained Hawk missiles. Guilty:
   The jury found North not guilty on the charge of obstruction of
Congress in this count, but then found him guilty of the subsidiary
charge of aiding and abetting that obstruction.
   Testifying in his own defense, North blamed McFarlane, who by
November 1986 had been out of the government for a year, for
formulating the false chronology.
   North also testified that Poindexter and then-CIA Director
William Casey knew that missiles were aboard the plane and that
other top U.S. officials knew because intelligence agencies tracked
the shipment hour-by-hour. Despite that, he said, Poindexter and
Casey helped prepare false testimony for Congress saying that no
one in the government knew the true cargo until January 1986.
   North testified that it was necessary to maintain a false cover
story about the shipment in order to protect the lives of U.S.
hostages held in Lebanon. The Iranians were not satisfied with the
shipment, and North said the U.S. government needed to distance
itself from the transaction.

   Counts 7-8, obstructing a presidential inquiry; making false
statements. Not guilty on both counts:
   When then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III, at Reagan's request,
questioned North about the diversion of arms profits to the Contras
on Nov. 23, 1986, North is accused of telling Meese the NSC was not
involved, that the Israelis determined the amount that went to the
Contras and that rebel leader Adolfo Calero had been ordered to
open Swiss bank accounts to receive arms profit money from Israel.
   Meese testified North told him those untruths, but under
questioning by the defense he agreed he was conducting only an
``administrative inquiry'' and North was under no legal compulsion
to answer. The judge's instructions to the jurors said that to
convict North, they would have to find that he had been ``correctly
informed of the true nature of the proceeding'' and that his
specific intent was to obstruct the inquiry.
   North denied making untrue statements, saying he readily
admitted to the attorney general and his aides the diversion of
Iran arms proceeds to the Contras.
   The only written records of the attorney general's meeting with
North are 29 pages of what North described as ``very cryptic
notes'' taken by one of Meese's aides.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Count 9, destroying, altering or removing documents from the
NSC. Guilty:
   North said McFarlane told him to alter five ``problem memos''
North wrote in 1985, to wipe out references of North's secret
assistance to the Contras and McFarlane's knowledge of it. North
said he believed Reagan wanted the documents changed ``because
everything I had done that was described in the documents ... I had
been told was at the direction of the president of the United
States.''
   McFarlane contradicted North's testimony, saying it was North
who suggested altering the memos in 1985 when Congress first
inquired about North's Contra activities. North directed his
secretary, Fawn Hall, to make the alterations in November 1986 as
the Iran-Contra affair was about to be disclosed.
   Miss Hall said she shredded the originals without instruction
from North, testifying that ``it seemed the logical thing to do.''
   To convict on that count, the jury was told, ``the defendant
must have known his conduct was unlawful.'' Asked at the trial
whether he knew that, North replied ``No, they were his
(McFarlane's) documents. It never occurred to me that that would be
unlawful.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Count 10, illegally accepting a $13,800 home security system
from Iran-Contra co-defendant Richard Secord, who North had hired
to run arms to the Contras. Guilty:
   North admitted he never paid for the system, but said he never
got a bill for it. He said he didn't know Secord had footed the
bill, although it was a meeting with Secord and former CIA employee
Glenn Robinette that led to the installation. After he was fired
from the NSC, North admitted he tried to conceal the fact he hadn't
paid for the system by sending two backdated letters to Robinette.
   North said he had gotten the system installed after being
targeted for assassination by terrorist Abu Nidal and just before
North was scheduled to go to Iran in an attempt to win release of
U.S. hostages held in Lebanon. North said he tried to get the
government to protect his home but was turned down because he
wasn't high-ranking enough.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Count 11, converting traveler's checks to his own use. Not
guilty:
   Contra leader Calero testified he gave $90,000 in traveler's
checks to North, partly to help in securing release of American
hostages in Lebanon and partly for the Contra aid effort. North
kept the money in his office safe. The government charged North
spent $4,300 of it on personal expenses. Calero testified he didn't
demand an accounting because ``I would trust him with my life.''
North denied spending the money on himself, saying he used it to
reimburse himself for out-of-pocket expenses connected with his job.
   The jury was told that to convict North, it would have to find
he used the checks ``in a manner not authorized in advance by the
owner'' and ``for purposes other than the purpose under which the
traveler's checks came into his possession as a government
employee.''
   In an attempt to bolster its charge, the prosecution brought out
that North had paid $8,000 in cash in October 1985 for a family car
and that until mid-1985 he had complained repeatedly to an NSC
employee about not having enough money to buy lunch and gasoline to
get home. North denied dipping into the office-safe fund for
personal expenses, saying he bought the car out of a $15,000 cash
fund he kept in a metal box bolted to his closet floor at home.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Count 12, the only conspiracy count against North, charged he
took part in a scheme with fund-raisers Richard Miller, Dan Conrad
and Carl Channell to defraud the Treasury of the United States by
drumming up funds for the Contras' military effort under the cover
of a tax-exempt organization, the National Endowment for the
Preservation of Liberty. Not guilty:
   North insisted McFarlane authorized him to brief potential
contributors with the stricture ``that I would not say to a single
person, `Would you give me money?' I never did that.'' While he
sometimes would explain how much weapons would cost, he could not
recall ``a single donor ever giving money in my presence or ...
ever asked to give me money in my presence, not one.''

<HEAD>Another Scar On the Fractured Image of Oliver North</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A clear-minded warrior, a wearied desk jockey.
A born-again moralist, a teller of lies. A patriot convicted of
crimes against the United States.
   A federal jury delivered that last, cruelest cut of all Thursday
to the already fractured image of Oliver L. North, pronouncing him
both innocent and guilty at the same trial.
   Guilty, of falsifying and destroying documents, of abetting the
obstruction of Congress, of accepting an illegal gratuity.
   Innocent of nine other felony charges linked to his role as
action officer in the Iran-Contra affair.
   In reaching its verdict, the jury had to consider whether this
former lieutenant colonel and staff member of the National Security
Council was true to his government and his mission, or whether his
deceits, principally to Congress, were the designs of a rogue
operating outside the law.
   North left the courtroom just as he arrived _ eyes straight
ahead, shoulders squared, no display of emotion save for a brief
embrace with his wife.
   Later, he would issue this statement: ``As a Marine I was taught
to fight _ and fight hard _ for as long as it takes to prevail. We
will continue this battle, and with the support and prayers of the
American people I will be fully vindicated.''
   The central figure in the worst foreign policy debacle of Ronald
Reagan's presidency, North came to run some of the administration's
riskiest ventures from a cluttered room, No. 392, in the Old
Executive Office Building next door to the White House.
   Congress tried for months to unravel the mysteries surrounding
North. But, like the 1987 commission headed by former Sen. John
Tower, congressional panels left many questions unanswered.
Meanwhile, in nationally televised hearings, a defiant Oliver North
emerged from his shadowy world, one of pseudonyms and codes and
furtive border crossings, to confront his tormentors.
   ``Ollie stood up there, took the heat, and the American people
in every bar in Chicago and every bowling alley in Texas and every
little home said, `Hey, this guy believes in something, and I can
identify with it,''' said George Bush last December.
   North's bravado, and his subsequent whirlwind of $25,000
speeches to cheering conservatives around the country, revealed
just one of his many sides.
   He has always been ``Ollie'' to his White House co-workers and
the American right. But to his brothers and sisters, his
high-school chums back in Philmont, N.Y., he remains Larry North.
To surviving members of his Vietnam combat platoon, he is ``Blue,''
leader of ``Blue's Bastards.'' In other travels, he has been
``Paul,'' or ``Mr. Goode,'' or ``Mr. Johns,'' or ``Steelhammer.''
   Another code name may be most telling: ``Blank Check.'' That was
the term assigned to the private, interoffice computer
communications network between North and his superior, former
National Security Adviser John M. Poindexter. The Tower commission
found that the creation of ``Blank Check'' coincided with the
initial shipment of anti-tank missiles to Iran, 14 months before
the scheme blew up in the Reagan administration's face in late 1986.
   According to Richard Allen, Reagan's first national security
adviser, North was brought to the NSC in 1981 ``to handle easels
and carry the charts.'' Yet he became, in a matter of months, the
NSC's chief troubleshooter.
   He was there for the invasion of Grenada in 1983; initial arms
shipments by the CIA to the Nicaraguan rebels, also in 1983; the
mining of three harbors in Nicaragua in early 1984; a crackdown on
the death squads in El Salvador; the interception of an Egyptian
airliner carrying the hijackers of the cruise ship Achille Lauro;
and the bombing raid on Libya in 1986.
   Part of North's ascendancy, no doubt, can be attributed to his
own fervor. ``If there was a loose ball,'' said retired Maj. Gen.
John Singlaub, a key player in North's efforts to aid the Contras,
``Oliver North would grab it and run with it.''
   As a youth, he was kept on a tight leash. His father, Oliver
Clay North, an Army colonel who won a Silver Star in World War II,
worked long hours at a family wool mill before it fell victim to
polyester and he switched to teaching history.
   His mother, Ann, would whistle for the kids to come in every
evening at 5 p.m. for dinner. Family ritual included a discussion
of world events before the table was cleared. In school, he ran
track and was in the chorus, chess, drama and science clubs as well
as the student council. The girls voted him best-looking.
   He was a southpaw boxer at the Naval Academy, making it into the
intramural finals against a highly favored James Webb, later to
become Navy secretary. North won again, on points.
   After his graduation, a review board threatened to dismiss him
because of injuries suffered earlier in a car wreck. North made the
board look at the film of his fight against Webb. He got his
commission.
   Soon after North and Betsy Stuart were married, North was
shipped out to Vietnam, where he led the second platoon, K Company,
3rd Battalion, Third Marines. Once, despite broken ribs and a
punctured lung, North rose up to kill an enemy gunner with a
grenade. That got him a Bronze Star.
   But North, in recounting his Vietnam record, has sometimes
seemed to exaggerate. He has testified that his decorations
included ``several'' purple hearts; military records show two. He
headed a platoon of 40 men, but said in court that he was a company
commander ``in the Special Operations Force.'' Again, no record of
it. He has said in court that he was in Vietnam from 1968 through
early 1970'' and then again ``in 1971,'' but the corps says it has
no record of an extended first tour or second tour.
   After tours at Quantico, Va., and in Okinawa, North wound up
with a desk at Marine Corps headquarters. He worked 18 hours a day.
   Something finally snapped. North wound up in Bethesda Naval
Hospital for 22 days, diagnosed as suffering ``delayed battle
stress.'' Once again, he overcame his difficulties and was cleared
for duty.
   By 1980, he was off for a year of study at the Naval War
College, a necessary ticket for a would-be star. Classmates
remember he always sat in the front row, always flattered his
lecturers. They didn't much like it, but the brass, including Navy
Secretary John Lehman, was impressed.
   When it came time to fill a deputy's slot at the National
Security Council, North was the man.
   One of his responsibilities was coordinating anti-terrorism
policies, a license for him to roam the world. It was not unusual
for him to jet off at night to another country and be back for the
NSC's regular staff meeting at 7:45 a.m.
   He flew on White House jets, chartered jets, and commercial
airlines, often using false names and oddball disguises. Richard
Allen called it a ``rinky-dink'' habit.
   But North did get things done. His finest hour was the
apprehension of the hijackers of the Achille Lauro, the Italian
cruise liner seized by Palestinians who killed an American
passenger, Leon Klinghofer. With the help of Israeli intelligence,
North determined that the perpetrators, who had surrendered to
Egyptian authorities, were to be flown to asylum in Tunisia. He
mapped out a plan whereby Navy fighter jets intercepted the plane
and forced it to land at a NATO base in southern Italy.
   North's response in that case, triggered by the sickening,
wanton murder of the wheelchair-ridden Klinghofer, reflected an
obsessive concern for innocent suffering. He kept pictures of the
American hostages in Lebanon at his desk. When he went to Central
America, he would return with photos of women and children living
in terrible conditions.
   Even his severest critics credit North with compassion, noting
he played a major role in convincing the administration to pressure
El Salvador to bridle right-wing death squads there.
   His emotional commitment to his causes, the long absences from
his family and his marathon workdays continued to take their toll.
Co-workers said he often looked like a ghost in the hallways.
Former National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane said North broke
down into tears on several occasions when his projects took a bad
turn.
   McFarlane advised North to return to Bethesda for a rest, but
the young colonel wouldn't relent.
   North acknowledges some lapses of judgment, including his hand
in the phony documentation designed to cover up his acceptance of a
free security system at his home. But that, he said, was driven by
his concern for family.
   And, ``I did not commit any crime'' by misleading Congress about
the secret attempts to bolster the Contras, he said on the day he
was indicted in March of last year. ``I can assure you, I will
never give up.''
   On that score, nobody doubts that Oliver North was telling the
truth. But his fate may rest ultimately on the shoulders of a man
who takes a kind and gentle view of him.
   Asked if North will be remembered as a hero, George Bush said
last year ``You know, I think Ollie will. And you know why he will?
It's not (what) went wrong. He said he made mistakes. I'll say he
made some mistakes. But he believed passionately in something.''

<HEAD>Consumer Advocate: Subsidized Wheat Exports Threaten America's Own
Supplies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer advocate Rod Leonard is still nipping
at the Agriculture Department for operating a popular export
subsidy program while the U.S. wheat supply drains away.
   Leonard is executive director of the private, non-profit
Community Nutrition Institute, which joined several other consumer
groups last fall in seeking a suspension of the export program
until 1989 harvest prospects became clearer.
   But USDA shrugged off the request and continued to operate the
Export Enhancement Program through the winter. Leonard repeated the
request on April 3 in a letter to Agriculture Secretary Clayton
Yeutter.
   Leonard said Thursday that he never did receive a direct reply
from Yeutter or anyone at USDA. But he did get a response of sorts
when President Bush announced this week that 1.5 million metric
tons of wheat would be sold to the Soviet Union under the subsidy
program.
   It was ``one of those Solomon-like decisions'' by Bush to sell
the Soviets only half of the 3 million tons reportedly sought by
Moscow and endorsed by USDA and lawmakers from wheat country, he
said in a telephone interview.
   Under EEP, as the program is called, private exporters can sell
wheat to a designated foreign country at prices lower than
otherwise would be charged, in order to make the sale. Exporters
then collect a ``bonus'' or subsidy to make up the difference. The
subsidies are in the form of surplus commodities owned by the
department's Commodity Credit Corp.
   What concerns Leonard is the relatively scant supply of wheat
held in U.S. granaries that once bulged with surpluses.
   Some grain experts say there will be enough wheat, that the new
crop is almost ready for harvest in southern areas and that some
reserves held by farmers soon will be available to the market.
   Leonard isn't so certain. As it looks at the moment, he says,
the 1989 wheat crop may be ``somewhat under'' 2.1 billion bushels.
   And if current long-range weather forecasts are correct about
below-normal rainfall in some areas in the next few months, parts
of the important spring-wheat region could be in trouble, Leonard
said.
   ``We're not going to have enough wheat to meet the total
consumption that we've been supporting the last two years,''
Leonard said. ``We're not going to have enough wheat to meet the
export demands we'd like to be able to supply.''
   Last year's wheat harvest, lowered by drought and substantial
acreage reductions imposed by USDA programs, was only 1.81 billion
bushels. According to USDA figures, including leftover grain from
previous harvests, the total U.S. wheat supply in the 1988-89
marketing year that began last June 1 was a bit less than 3.1
billion bushels.
   Out of that supply for 1988-89, domestic use is expected to be
around 1.05 billion bushels and exports 1.5 billion bushels, making
a total of about 2.55 billion bushels required to meet demands.
   As a result of the demand exceeding last year's harvest, the
wheat left over this June 1 is expected to be only about 549
million bushels.
   In Leonard's view, this will not provide enough leeway for the
United States to meet export requirements and still maintain
adequate reserves during the 1989-90 marketing year. By June 1,
1990, he said, the wheat stockpile could be down to 300 million
bushels or less _ the smallest carryover since 1952 when it was 256
million bushels.
   For years, farm commodity groups and lawmakers have insisted
that the United States be a reliable supplier of agricultural
commodities, recalling with scorn the partial embargo imposed on
sales to the Soviet Union in 1980 by the Carter administration to
punish Moscow for invading Afghanistan.
   The export subsidy program, or EEP, has operated since 1985 to
make U.S. commodities competitive in targeted markets where foreign
competitors _ notably the European Economic Community _ intrude
with subsidized sales of their own. About 65 countries have been
designated for subsidized sales, including the Soviet Union and
China.
   Leonard says the wheat export level of the last two years _
about 1.5 billion bushels annually _ is seen by many as a benchmark
for shipments in 1989-90.
   ``The argument that we have to be a reliable supplier is a
powerful force, but we're not going to be able to export 1.5
billion bushels, and if that's the mark of a reliable supplier ...
we're just not going to have it.''
   A wrangle involving USDA and the Office of Management and Budget
was settled by Bush's announcement that Moscow could buy 1.5
million tons of subsidized wheat. That's about 55 million bushels,
allowing 36.7 bushels per ton.
   The Soviets have been getting U.S. wheat since EEP subsidies
were made available four years ago, with purchases totaling slight
more than 4 million tons _ 147 million bushels _ since last Oct. 1.
The new EEP authorization would push those sales to about 202
million bushels.
   China, the biggest foreign buyer of U.S. wheat this season, has
bought half again as much subsidized wheat as the Soviet Union,
with purchases totaling 8.27 million tons, or 304 million bushels.
   Carl Schwensen, executive vice president of the National
Association of Wheat Growers, said his group plans to ``continue
pushing for use of the EEP to the Soviet Union and other
countries.''
   Schwensen said he understood that as part of the arrangement the
Soviet Union would buy an additional 1.5 million tons of wheat at
non-subsidized prices this summer, making up the 3 million tons
initially advocated.
   Asked about matching current export levels in the coming year,
Schwensen said the United States should ``endeavor to reach that
target'' and added that he thought there will be ``adequate

   The jury in Oliver L. North's Iran-Contra
trial drew a fine distinction between lies told to keep a covert
operation secret and falsehoods offered when the mission was being
publicly exposed.
   The jury dealt a setback to Iran-Contra prosecutors by clearing
the former Marine lieutenant colonel of all charges that he lied to
Congress when asked if he was secretly helping arm the Nicaraguan
rebels.
   But the jury convicted North of helping prepare a false
chronology of the Iran-Contra affair and destroying key documents
once the covert operation's cover was blown by public disclosures.
   Lying was a major theme of the prosecution's case. Prosecutors
argued from the start that deceiving Congress damages democracy
because government only functions properly when the truth is told.
   The jury apparently accepted this argument with a caveat _ that
deception to protect a covert operation might be justified. Jurors,
however, did not fully accept North's argument that his actions
were always justified because he had authority from superiors.
   ``I think perhaps they drew a distinction between the potential
for jeopardizing lives and assets while the mission was still
secret and what occurred after public revelations,'' said Richard
Ben-Veniste, a Washington criminal lawyer and former Watergate
prosecutor.
   ``They quite clearly acquitted Oliver North on those areas of
criminal activity in which he was acting at the behest of the
administration prior to the blowing of the cover on the entire
operation in the fall of 1986,'' said Harvard University law
professor Laurence Tribe.
   ``Once the cover was blown, his actions in aiding and abetting
the obstruction of Congress and in shredding documents were, I
think, quite properly deemed criminal.''
   North's claim that the verdict is a ``partial vindication'' has
some credibility.
   The jury rejected independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh's
contention that North was a liar and a thief but found him guilty
of other misdeeds _ accepting installation of a security system
outside his home by an arms dealer and destroying official
documents once the Iran-Contra affair was publicly known in
November 1986.
   ``You can't say at this juncture that either side walked away
with their theory intact,'' said Lawrence Barcella, a Washington
criminal lawyer and a former federal prosecutor.
   Lead prosecutor John Keker noted that North was convicted of
three ``serious felony charges,'' insisting that ``the principle
that no man is above the law has been vindicated.''
   ``There is something there for everyone,'' Ben-Veniste said.
   The jury appeared to have both accepted and rejected North's
defense that he was only acting on orders from above _ depending
upon the circumstances.
   It cleared him of a charge of lying to House Intelligence
Committee members in August 1986 _ apparently accepting North's
explanation that he only met with lawmakers at the insistence of
then-national security adviser John Poindexter.
   The jury, however, convicted North of aiding and abetting the
obstruction of Congress by helping Poindexter and the late CIA
Director William Casey prepare a false chronology of the
Iran-Contra affair in November 1986.
   ``It appears to be a very fact-bound decision,'' Barcella said.
   The jury cleared North of a charge he pocketed $4,300 of the
$90,000 worth of travelers checks given to him by a Contra leader
to cover expenses.
   Yet it convicted the former presidential aide of illegally
accepting installation of a security system outside his home by
arms dealer Richard V. Secord.
   On this count, jurors appeared to hold North accountable because
he admitted trying to cover up the gift by fabricating evidence he
paid for the $13,800 security gate.
   Again, the jury objected to a coverup not justified by national
security considerations.
   ``It really reflects much more the jury's probable dismay at the
falsification of bills, preparation of false letters _ again a
coverup,'' said Tribe.
   ``We have here an example of a very careful jury, certainly not
a hanging jury, drawing a very careful distinctions,'' he said.
   The verdict, he added, undercuts ``the elitist assumption that
some have made that a group of not very well educated people who
were ignorant of the Iran-Contra hearings somehow couldn't draw the
lines required.''

   The two reusable booster rockets
that helped Atlantis soar into space were on their way back to port
today from the spot where they splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean
50 miles offshore.
   Two ships were to start towing them this morning and they were
expected to reach port by evening, said Rocky Raab, a spokesman for
Morton Thiokol Inc., which makes the rockets.
   The rockets were redesigned after the failure of a booster
rocket part caused the explosion of Challenger in January 1986 and
the deaths of seven astronauts.
   As planned, the rockets separated from the winged orbiter just a
little more than two minutes after Thursday's launch. Five minutes
after that they fell into the ocean.

<HEAD>Shuttle Launch Cheers Scientists At Planetary Science Lab</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As Venus-bound Magellan began the first
leg of a 15-month journey, scientists at the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory cheered and swapped hugs and kisses, celebrating the
lab's first planetary spacecraft in 11 years.
   ``It's been a long dry spell since we've had a planetary
launch,'' said geologist Neil Nickle, spokesman for Magellan, which
was deployed from the cargo bay of Atlantis several hours after
Thursday's shuttle launch.
   Jet Propulsion Laboratory is a California Institute of
Technology facility that runs America's unmanned space exploration
program under contract to the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
   Work at the lab came to a standstill as employees watched the
countdown and launch of Atlantis on closed-circuit television
monitors. Nickle said about 300 people watched from the lab's
cafeteria.
   NASA's last mission to another planet was in 1978, when a
Pioneer probe was launched to Venus. That project was run by NASA's
Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif.
   All previous U.S. unmanned planetary spacecraft were launched by
expendable rockets.

<HEAD>American Planetary Probe Named For 16th-Century Portuguese Explorer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An expedition headed by Portuguese
explorer Ferdinand Magellan needed three years to sail around the
world in the 16th century.
   That's more than twice the time it should take the robot
spacecraft Magellan to travel 806 million miles to Venus.
   Magellan, who chose to sail under the Spanish flag, commanded a
five-ship flotilla that left Seville, Spain, on Sept. 20, 1519, to
search for a route to the so-called Spice Islands in the south
Pacific.
   The fleet reached South America in December and then sailed
around the southern tip of that continent through what came to be
called the Straits of Magellan. The ships continued across the
Pacific Ocean and reached Guam on March 6, 1521, then went on to
what became the Philippine Islands.
   The Spanish sailors got into a fight with natives on Mactan
Island on April 27, 1521, and Magellan was killed.
   Magellan's fleet continued its voyage, with Juan Sebastian
Elcano in command, but one ship after another was lost until only
the Victoria was left. The vessel returned to Spain on Sept. 8,
1522. Only 17 men, of an original crew of 270, survived the voyage.

   Princess Anne's personal maid says she knows
nothing about love letters that disappeared from the princess'
briefcase and ended up at a newspaper office.
   The disclosure that the queen's daughter had received personal
letters from royal aide Timothy Laurence, a Royal Navy commander,
renewed rumors of trouble in her 15-year marriage to former army
captain Mark Phillips.
   Linda Joyce, 30, told the weekly New Statesmen magazine on
Thursday that she wanted to clear her name after some newspapers
pointed to her as the principal suspect, reporting that she had a
falling out with the princess.
   Miss Joyce said that anyone could have stolen the letters,
especially since the briefcase has been around the world.
   She also admitted having arguments with the princess.
   ``You do get angry with people because they do something that
affects you,'' she said. ``And I can't say that I am so placid that
I never get angry with her.''
   Miss Joyce said she had handed in her notice at the start of the
year, long before the letters scandal.

<HEAD>Regulators Divided Over Legality Of `Silence-for-Money' Deals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Disclosure of ``silence-for-money'' deals
between builders and workers at nuclear power plants has touched
off a debate among federal regulators over whether to ban such
agreements.
   Members of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission acknowledged
Thursday that they could not agree on the legality of one such
agreement, which included restrictions on a nuclear plant workers'
right to testify at NRC licensing hearings.
   The commission chairman, Lando W. Zech Jr., said he has
instructed the agency's legal counsel to study the issue and
recommend ways of clarifying NRC policy.
   Joseph J. Macktal, a former electrician at the Comanche Peak
nuclear plant in Texas, told a Senate panel Thursday he signed a
labor settlement with the plant's builder that rewarded him for not
telling the NRC about alleged safety flaws.
   Macktal, who is challenging the legality of the 1987 agreement,
said his former lawyers ``browbeat'' him into signing, and that he
was misled about its terms.
   In sworn testimony to a Senate Environment and Public Works
subcommittee, Macktal said he believed ``the agreement prevented me
from talking to anybody'' about safety problems he said he observed
during nearly 12 months' work at the plant.
   The subcommittee is investigating how many such secret deals
have been made at the nation's 110 licensed commercial nuclear
power plants. Officials said earlier this week the panel knows of
one other and is seeking details of a third.
   Louis Austin Jr., president of Brown &amp; Root, the company that
built the Comanche Peak plant near Glen Rose, Texas, told the
subcommittee he believed the Macktal deal was legal. But he added
that the company wished the law were more clear.
   Macktal signed the agreement to settle his complaint with the
Labor Department that Brown &amp; Root had unfairly dismissed him as a
result of his allegations about unsafe conditions. He said the deal
gave him $15,000, and his lawyers got $20,000.
   Zech said he personally believed that such deals are illegal but
that some of the four other commissions disagreed.
   ``Something has to be done about it,'' Zech said, adding that
late last month he asked all nuclear utilities and vendors to
report any such deals to the NRC by July 31.
   James R. Curtiss, a member of the commission, told the
subcommittee he was not convinced the Macktal agreement was
illegal. He stressed that although it contained some restrictions
on Macktal's right to testify before the commission, it did not
explicitly stop him from contacting the NRC staff about safety
matters.
   But Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming, the ranking Republican on the
subcommittee, said the Macktal deal contained so much restrictive
and ambiguous language that it ``strains every bit of common sense
in the world'' to believe Macktal would feel free to pursue his
safety allegations with members of the NRC staff.
   ``This stinks,'' Simpson said.

   George F. Kennan, the venerable retired
American diplomat, and Sen. Sam Nunn, the influential chairman of
the Senate Armed Services Committee, are challenging President Bush
to do some new thinking about West Germany.
   Kennan, who played a leading role in the post-World War II
``containment'' of the Soviet Union, says in his gentle, diplomatic
way that U.S. policy seems to be humming along without much
recognition of recent changes in Moscow.
   Nunn, who is not a diplomat, flatly accused the Bush
administration Wednesday of having no vision and ``shooting itself
in the foot'' by not seeking a compromise with a West German
electorate concerned about short-range nuclear weapons.
   The rift, with Chancellor Helmut Kohl demanding U.S.
negotiations with the Soviets and Bush saying that would be a
mistake, is straining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   If it is not healed soon, the orchestration for a smooth Bush
summit meeting in Brussels May 29-30 with the leaders of the 15
other NATO countries could dissolve into dissonance.
   Most of the Lance missiles, which Bush and British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher want to make more powerful, are in West
Germany as part of the 30-year-old NATO strategy of deterring
Soviet aggression with the threat of a nuclear response.
   In 1987, all U.S. and Soviet intermediate-range nuclear rockets
were banned. That changed the strategic picture in Europe somewhat.
   But the Lances, which now have a range of about 70 miles, are
visible reminders to the West Germans that the next war might very
well be fought on their territory _ and it could be a nuclear war.
   Kennan, writing for a Johns Hopkins University think tank before
the dispute boiled over, all but anticipated the problem.
   He noted: Medium-range nuclear missiles are coming out of
Europe. The Soviet Union is taking more forthcoming positions in
arms control negotiations. President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has
announced unilateral tank and troop withdrawals from Eastern Europe.
   ``All these could not fail to raise in West German minds the
question of whether the Soviet `threat' was still so serious as to
warrant the indefinite continuation of the military burdens West
Germany has been asked to bear,'' he wrote.
   While West Germans are divided on such questions, Kennan says,
many of them are looking for a fresh review of the dimensions of
NATO deployments in West Germany and the stance NATO is taking in
negotiating over non-nuclear forces with the Warsaw Pact in Vienna.
   But the former U.S. ambassador to Moscow and policy planning
chief at the State Department says he has looked in vain for
evidence that this view is accepted by U.S., British and French
officials.
   ``No appreciable changes have been made or planned in the actual
disposition of NATO forces, nor do there seem to have been any
significant changes in the Western stand on arms control problems
recently under negotiation,'' he said.
   The West German government, a coalition of conservatives headed
by Kohl and liberals led by Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher, actually is united on the short-range missiles _ and on
demanding a change in Washington and London.
   The Germans are saying they will not modernize the short-range
missiles and want to reduce, and perhaps eliminate, such weapons on
both sides of the East-West line.
   The Bush administration is saying no to all of the above, and is
prepared to air the dispute at the Brussels summit meeting. Marlin
Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said Wednesday the Western
alliance is healthy enough to stand the disagreement, that
controversies are a sign of NATO's vitality.
   Nunn, however, is uncomfortable with the U.S.-German rift _ and
with the administration's approach.
   ``I don't see any strategy at all coming out of this,'' Nunn
said. ``I see both sides of this argument as having no vision.''

<HEAD>Commerce, Pentagon Security Agreement is Criticized</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An agreement between the Pentagon and the
Commerce Department to review government computer security plans
gives military intelligence too much influence over civilian
technology and data, critics of the plan say.
   The agreement ``invites'' the National Security Agency ``to
enter the offices of private information companies and government
contractors'' to help deal with computer security problems, said
Marc Rotenberg of Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility,
a public-interest group based in Palo Alto, Calif.
   Rotenberg was one of several witnesses to appear Thursday before
the House Government Operations subcommittee on legislation and
national security, which is reviewing the 1987 Computer Security
Act.
   The hearing focused largely on a memorandum signed March 24 by
officials of the NSA, the Pentagon's intelligency agency and the
nation's largest, and the National Institute of Standards and
Technology, a research arm of the Commerce Department.
   Under prodding from Congress, the two agencies have started
working closely together to review computer security plans
submitted by offices throughout the government for protecting
systems containing sensitive but unclassified data.
   Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Mich., chairman of the subcomittee,
said that under the 1987 legislation, ``the relationship between
NSA and Commerce was clearly intended to be advisory only, with NSA
serving as a technical facilitator to the Department of Commerce.''
   He said, however, that he agreed with many people who have
complained that the memorandum allows the security agency to
encroach upon the central role given Commerce under the statute.
   Conyers, also chairman of the full Government Operations
Committee, said any agreement that weakens civilian control in the
computer security area ``will result in unwarranted personal
intrusions and inhibitors to both domestic and international
commerce.''
   Also expressing concern over the interagency memorandum was
Albert R. Belisle, a Bank of Boston executive who testified on
behalf of the Washington-based American Bankers Association.
   ``Banks need independently developed security technology that is
not pre-empted by NSA control,'' said Belisle, a Bank of Boston
executive who was representing the American Bankers Association.
   James J. Hearn, NSA's deputy director for information security,
called the memorandum of understanding a ``substantial achievement
for both agencies.''
   He said that in negotiating the memorandum ``we have been able
to develop a better understanding of each other's mission and this
in turn has led to renewed confidence and trust.''
   ``Key senior officials in both agencies have worked hard to
build on the ongoing technical cooperation,'' he said.
   Also testifying in support of the MOU was Ray Kammer, acting
director of NIST, which is located in suburban Gaithersburg, Md.
   ``The (memorandum) provides a number of benefits to NIST and the
Department of Commerce,'' he said.

   A top federal drug official says international
law enforcement teamwork to fight the war on drugs must be
``transparent to borders'' even when the partner is a country like
Panama.
   The possibility that drug traffickers might gain access to
detailed U.S. information on investigations ``makes things
complicated,'' said David Westrate, the Drug Enforcement
Administration's chief of enforcement.
   ``On the other hand, we do accomplish things, significant
things,'' he said Thursday, adding that, like the investigation of
the 1985 slaying of DEA agent Enrique Camarena in Mexico, the
United States can pursue dual probes, one involving the foreign
government and one on its own.
   The DEA, he said, maintains an extremely complicated
relationship with Panama, where the government is virtually
controlled by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   While Noriega has been indicted on drug-trafficking charges by
federal grand juries in Florida, the DEA finds it ``in the best
interests of the United States'' to work with the Panamanian
government, he said.
   ``Less than two weeks ago, they assisted us in a convoy of
cocaine from Colombia on its way to New York,'' he said. ``There
are a lot of examples like that.''
   Westrate praised the increased cooperation by foreign
governments in the war on drugs, and attributed their interest to
fears that they could become wracked by drug-related violence, as
Colombia has been.
   He singled out the Mexican government for praise, saying that
country is ``making good, solid progress'' in the drug war.
   The Mexican government's increased interest in cracking down on
the drug traffickers stems from successful efforts to curtail the
flow of cocaine through the Bahamas, which has pushed traffickers
to find other routes. The routes they found run through Mexico, he
said.
   All of the cocaine entering the United States used to come
through the Caribbean to southern Florida, but now one-third of it
comes through Mexico, he said.
   ``That has driven a marriage between the traditional Mexican
trafficking groups and the Colombian trafficking groups,'' Westrate
said.
   One reflection of Mexico's increased concern is its arrest April
8 of Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo, 43, that country's reputed drug
kingpin, and seizure of his assets.
   ``Some say that there is a potential behind this one trafficker
to have that government seize up to $1 billion in trafficker
assets,'' Westrate said. ``That's one crook. Think about the
enormous potential that that money brings in terms of power to
corrupt establishments, to buy businesses, to buy real property, to
do just anything a person wants. And that person's not unique.''
   Westrate said international cooperation is one of the few
hopeful signs in the drug war.
   European countries are becoming more concerned about cocaine
because there's a glut on the market here, with kilos selling for
as little as $9,000. The same cocaine can bring $50,000 to $60,000
in Europe, he said.
   ``The seizure rate there is going off the scope,'' Westrate
said, adding that when Europe establishes free and open borders
between countries in 1992, the situation will get worse. ``I think
the picture for Europe is grim.''
   As an example of international cooperation and the far-flung
activities of the DEA, Westrate cited several major operations,
without giving specifics on their targets. One involves five
countries, 28 DEA offices, 197 individual investigations and 20
wiretaps, 150 informants. Another involves 15 countries, 51 DEA
offices, 126 investigations, 60 informants.

   A noted pediatrician says his patients will
suffer and die because of attacks by a powerful congressman on the
work of a Nobel Prize-winning researcher.
   ``I can promise you that organizations of patients, when made
fully aware of what you are doing, are going to fight this tooth
and nail,'' Dr. David Nathan wrote to Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich.
   Nathan is physician-in-chief at Children's Hospital in Boston
and professor of pediatrics at the Harvard Medical School.
   Dingell, chairman of the investigations subcommittee of the
House Energy and Commerce Committee, spent most of Thursday in a
hearing room attacking the handling of a dispute over a research
project led by David Baltimore, a molecular biologist at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology who won the Nobel Prize in
1975 for his work on cancer-causing viruses.
   ``An attack on him is an attack on our patients. ... The David
Baltimores of this world have made it possible for them to live. It
is as simple as that,'' Nathan wrote in his April 26 letter, which
was distributed at the hearing.
   Nathan's letter appeared to be part of a growing effort by
scientists to defend Baltimore. The journal Science reported last
week, for example, that major figures in science were in touch with
minority Republican members of the subcommittee.
   A review committee is being reconstituted to look into new
allegations of missing data raised by Dr. Margot O'Toole, said
James Wyngaarden, director of the National Institutes of Health.
   Dr. O'Toole's dispatch of 17 pages of data to two NIH staffers
in 1986 started the long controversy over a paper in the scientific
journal Cell that year by Baltimore, Dr. Thereza Imanishi-Kari of
Tufts University and four others.
   Dr. O'Toole, at the time working on other projects in Dr.
Imanishi-Kari's lab, said the 17 pages showed that conclusions of
the paper were not supported by the original laboratory data.
   Reviews by MIT and Tufts determined that the conclusions,
dealing with the immune responses of mice bred with an extra immune
system gene from another species, were fully supported by some
1,000 data pages and no action was needed.
   A review panel convened by NIH, the one now being resurrected,
said that although there was no fraud or misrepresentation, errors
had occurred that should be corrected. Baltimore has sent one
correction letter to Cell and is preparing a supplemental letter to
deal with the latest accusation.
   A report from Secret Service experts said at least five and
possibly 25 pages in one of Dr. Imanishi-Kari's notebooks were
filled in as much as two years after the dates on the page. At
least two dates were changed.
   The two notebooks studied by the Secret Service had nothing to
do with the Cell article and showed only ``I am not a neat person
... very bad with dates,'' she said.
   She said she would often use the date on which data were taken,
perhaps logged by laboratory equipment, when writing them on paper
months later.
   Wyngaarden said he was establishing an Office of Scientific
Integrity to monitor and conduct investigations of possible
scientific impropriety. The Health and Human Services Department is
establishing an Office of Scientific Integrity Review to establish
policies to deal with scientific misconduct.

<HEAD>Woman Fights to Keep Shack on Cape Cod Dunes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SONNI EFRON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman seeking to preserve a way of life that
nourished some of the nation's best-known writers has asked a
federal appeals court to prohibit the government from demolishing
her rustic Cape Cod cottage.
   Grace E. Bessay said Thursday that she is the last defendant
remaining after nearly a quarter-century of litigation over a
cluster of historic dune shacks in Provincetown.
   For more a century, the primitive beach cabins have been used as
creative retreats by artists, poets, writers and celebrated
bohemians, including Jack Kerouac and Eugene O'Neill.
   Miss Bessay said her cottage, built around 1930, represents a
piece of Cape Cod history and a way of life that should not yield
to federal bulldozers.
   The Massachusetts Historical Commission has recommended that
Miss Bessay's shack on Cape Cod National Seashore and 17 others
belong on the National Register of Historic Places.
   The National Park Service, which overseas the national seashore,
says it has identified shacks visited by notable artists, and Miss
Bessay's cottage isn't among them.
   It says cottages frequented by Eugene O'Neill, Mabel Dodge and
Edmund Wilson are no longer standing, and there is no proof that
the likes of e.e. cummings, Kerouac and Norman Mailer spent time in
the rickety buildings that still cling to the isolated dunes.
   In a 1963 letter to one of Miss Bessay's neighbors, a copy of
which was supplied to The Associated Press, Kerouac wrote, ``Yes
residence on the dunes ... is uniquely sheltering and certainly
stimulating to creative work. It's true that I was working on `On
The Road' there, summer of 1950.''
   Still, the case before the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Boston appears to hinge not on its literary merits, but on arcane
matters of squatters' rights, the definition of a dwelling and
tangled questions of title.
   The government condemned the shack in 1967, but lawsuits
prevented its demolition. Most neighbors, meanwhile, have settled
their suits, many under agreements that will allow their cottages
to be demolished after their deaths.
   The government's attorney, David Shilton, told the three appeals
court justices that Miss Bessay does not have clear title to her
property, which she inherited from a friend in 1981.
   Furthermore, he said, the shack does not have the modern
electricity, sewage lines or running water that would qualify it as
the type of home that Congress intended to preserve when it created
the national seashore in 1961.
   Miss Bessay said that is exactly why artists and nature-lovers
like it.
   ``I don't want a generator banging away and making smells of
gasoline,'' she said. Living in a dune shack means ``getting your
water by hand pumps, which is a pleasure. It isn't a burden, it's a
pleasure. And kerosene lamps for light, that is also a pleasure.''
   Miss Bessay, who winters in Cambridge, says she is in her
mid-60s, but all the litigation has aged her.
   ``Some days I feel like I'm 110,'' she said.

<HEAD>US To Replace Seven Diplomats in Managua Expelled Last July</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department will replace seven of the
U.S. diplomats expelled from Nicaragua last year and allow the
Managua government to send seven new envoys to replace those
expelled from the United States.
   The upgrading of the respective embassy staffs does not reflect
an improvement in relations between the two countries but rather a
desire of both to be better represented in each other's capital,
U.S. officials said Thursday.
   Last July, the Sandinista government ordered U.S. Ambassador
Richard Melton and seven other envoys out of Nicaragua on charges
they were fomenting unrest.
   Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said all seven slots
below the ambassador level will be filled. In addition, four others

   A congressional plan to toughen the military's
standards of accounting for missing American soldiers and give
families more input has won the backing of retired Army Gen.
William C. Westmoreland.
   Westmoreland, who was U.S. military commander in Vietnam from
1964 to 1968, said Thursday that many families of the 2,364
unaccounted for Americans from the Vietnam War are ``plagued by the
uncertainty of (the fate of) loved ones.''
   Westmoreland and retired Navy Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt, commander of
the U.S. naval forces in Vietnam from 1968 to 1970, endorsed
legislation by Rep. John G. Rowland, R-Conn., to revamp the
government's accounting system for missing soldiers.
   The Missing Service Personnel Act of 1989 would set up special
three-member panels to investigate cases and bar killed-in-action
classifications based exclusively on the passage of time.

<NOTE>Senators Say Medicare Payment System Hurts Rural Hospitals</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W.
Sullivan is proposing steps to reverse inequities in Medicare
reimbursements that have been blamed for the frail health of the
nation's rural hospitals.
   Senate leaders say they believe those disparities are largely
responsible for a rural health care crisis that undermines the
future of entire communities.
   Sullivan on Thursday acknowledged the need to make ``Medicare's
payment system fairer,'' and proposed rural and large urban
hospitals receive greater inflation-based Medicare payment
increases next fiscal year than urban hospitals in communities of
less than 1 million population.
   More rural hospitals would also be allowed to qualify as ``sole
community hospitals,'' entitling them to higher Medicare payments.
   While federal officials acknowledge Sullivan's recommendations
will not keep all rural hospitals alive, they say the move should
help equalize profit margins between urban and rural hospitals.

   Two West Germans doing medical relief
work in Lebanon were freed early Friday, 10 hours after they were
kidnapped in the southern port of Sidon, a Moslem militia reported.
   The Sunni Moslem Nasserite militia, in a statement, said
Heinrich Struebig, 48, and Petra Schnitzler, 26, were released
without incident at 5 a.m. (11 p.m. Thursday EDT) and drove to
their office at the Palestinian refugee camp of Ein El-Hilweh
outside Sidon.
   The statement said joint efforts carried by its security
apparatus and the mainstream Shiite Moslem Amal militia resulted in
``locating the place where the two Germans were held.''
   ``They were released at 5 a.m. and crossed the Sinique Bridge to
the Sidon area. They are currently at their office in Ein
El-Hilweh,'' the statement said. It did not disclose further
details.
   Sinique Bridge separates the Sunni Moslem port of Sidon, 25
miles south of this war-ravaged capital, from the predominantly
Shiite Moslem sector of south Lebanon under Amal's control.
   The Nasserite Militia of Mustafa Saad, a Sunni group, has been
in control of Sidon since the outbreak of Lebanon's civil war in
1975.
   German Radio said the man and woman arrived by taxi before dawn
Friday in the refugee camp south of this war-ravaged capital.
Christian-run Voice of Lebanon also reported their release.
   The kidnapping had raised to 17 the number of foreigners being
held hostage in Lebanon, and was the first to involve in female
foreigner.
   The abduction came less than a week after the prosecution in
West Germany demanded a life sentence for Mohammed Ali Hamadi, a
Lebanese Shiite, for his role in the 1985 hijacking of a TWA plane
and the murder of a U.S. Navy diver who was aboard.
   The West German Embassy in Beirut was closed Friday, the
traditional Moslem day off.
   The West German Embassy in nearby Nicosia, Cyprus, said they
were waiting for news but could not confirm the report.
   ``We are hoping for good news, but for the time being there is
no news,'' said Karl Schrage, the embassy spokesman.
   A spokeswoman for the West German group Asme-Humanitas early
Friday identified the kidnap victims as Struebig, an administrator,
and Schnitzler, a nurse. The group does humanitarian work among
Palestinian refugees.
   The Moslem milita official said Mustafa Saad, head of the
Nasserite militia, immediately called Shiite Moslem militia leader
Nabih Berri in Beirut and asked him to act urgently to try to
secure the Germans' release.
   Berri's Syrian-backed Amal militia controls most of south
Lebanon.
   Hamadi's elder brother, Abdul-Hadi, heads the security apparatus
in Beirut of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, the
Shiite extremist group that is an umbrella for underground factions
holding most of the foreigners missing in Lebanon.
   Nine Americans, three Britons, an Italian, an Irishman and a
Belgian are believed held hostage. Longest held is American Terry
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press.
He was kidnapped on March 16, 1985.
   Abdul-Hadi Hamadi is believed to have engineered the abduction
of two West German citizens, Rudolf Cordes and Alfred Schmidt, in
west Beirut in January 1987 in an attempt to win the release of his
brother.
   Cordes, 53, Beirut manager for the West German firm Hoechst AG,
was kidnapped Jan. 17, 1987 as he was driving to west Beirut from
the airport after arriving from Frankfurt. He was released Sept.
12, 1987.
   Schmidt, 47, an engineer with Siemens AG, was kidnapped Jan. 20,
1987, and released September 7, 1987.
   The pro-Iranian Holy Warriors for Freedom claimed responsibility
for both abductions and said the releases were meant as a
``goodwill gesture'' to win a lenient sentence for Mohammed Hamadi.

<HEAD>Pentagon Considers Way to Keep Osprey Aircraft Alive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon is weighing a temporary reprieve
for the V-22 Osprey, the Marine Corps aircraft that Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney proposed terminating to meet a compromise
fiscal 1990 budget agreement.
   On Thursday, Deputy Defense Secretary Donald Atwood Jr. told the
Senate Appropriations defense subcommittee that the department is
considering either continuing the Osprey through a ``flight test
program'' or a ``minimal effort of technology demonstration.''
   The decision is expected shortly with the department facing a
threat by the contractors, Bell Helicopter Textron Inc., and Boeing
Helicopter Co., to stop work on the project today.
   ``What we have here is a game of high-stakes chicken,'' said
Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard, who noted that Cheney ``will not
issue a stop-work order, that we will continue to require the
contractor to complete the testing program under the terms of the
contract.''
   Howard said the companies received $245.8 million in March on
their fiscal 1989 contract and the Navy expects completion of the
contract. The companies have been using their own money because of
$27 million in cost overruns that could total as much as $150
million by the end of fiscal 1989.
   Cheney, forced to slash $10 billion from the fiscal 1990 defense
budget to meet an agreement between the White House and
congressional leaders, eliminated the battlefield aircraft designed
to take off like a helicopter but fly like an airplane.
   The Pentagon had planned to spend $25.9 billion on 663 Ospreys,
including $1.3 billion in 1990. The department had already invested
$2 billion in the program over a nine-year period.
   Both the flight test program and the demonstration program would
require reprogramming of money, according to Atwood, who said a pot
of $330 million exists for certain materials for production of 12
aircraft. The funds could be used if Congress approved.
   ``We hope to have a decision within a matter of a day or so,''
Atwood told the panel.
   Cheney's decision, which he has described as his most difficult,
has met with considerable opposition on Capitol Hill, where both
Republicans and Democrats attacked the planned cancellation.
   The Defense Department ``appears ... to be playing games with
us,'' Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, told Atwood. ``The Defense
Department knows how strongly Congress feels about it and intends
to put it back in.''
   Stevens threated not to vote for any defense authorization bill
that leaves out funding for the Osprey program.
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who discussed the issue with Atwood
prior to the hearing, said the department should ``explore the
possibility of maintaining at least enough efforts to keep Bell in
operation to maintain the status quo while this matter is evaluated
by the Congress.''
   Meanwhile, the commandant of the Marine Corps cast doubt on the
information Cheney used in deciding to eliminate the Osprey.
   ``I do not agree with the cost advice that he got nor do I agree
with the military operation use and conceptual framework of that,
but then I'm but one voice,'' Commandant Alfred Gray told the
Senate Armed Services Committee.
   ``Do you believe Secretary Cheney made the best decision he
could make based on faulty information?'' said Sen. Sam Nunn,
D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services panel.
   ``No,'' responded Gray, ``but based on the information he was
given by learned people who have their right to believe that
they're correct.''
   ``But you don't believe they're correct,'' Nunn said.
   ``No I don't, but I had my day in court,'' said Gray, who plans
to submit to the committee his interpretation of the program's cost
benefits.

<HEAD>Communist Party Chief Calls For Dialogue With Students</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BIERS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang called for a
dialogue with students in authorities' first public comment
following historic pro-democracy rallies in Tiananmen Square,
official media reported today.
   Students marched by the tens of thousands to occupy the square
Thursday and rally for more freedom. Some returned to class today
to end a two-week boycott but student leaders at Beijing University
refused to immediately call off the strike.
   Zhao, in a speech made Thursday but reported today in the party
organ People's Daily, said, ``Now we need broad consultations and
dialogue _ dialogue with students, dialogue with workers, dialogue
with intellectuals.''
   Student activists want the government to open talks with them on
demands for democracy, freedom of the press and an end to official
corruption. Zhao, while saying talks were needed, did not
specifically promise any meeting.
   The party leader acknowledged that great numbers of Chinese are
expressing anger toward official corruption, and attributed the
problem to a lack of openness and a faulty legal system.
   Zhao also seemed to tone down earlier official claims that
students were being manipulated by people who wanted to see the
country in turmoil. Such people ``are extremely few and we should
maintain vigilance. I think the vast majority of students
understand this.''
   Despite conciliatory official statements, some students feel
they must continue to pressure the government if concessions are
ever to be made in Communist China.
   ``Who announced the return to class? Can you face your
conscience and compatriots at home and abroad who have cared for us
and supported us?'' one student scrawled furiously on a sheet of
newspaper that he posted at Beijing University.
   Said an economics student who was reading the poster, ``If we go
back to class now then there's no pressure on the government and it
won't recognize our independent union.''
   Student leaders at Beijing University said they had not been
notified by the United Association of Beijing Universities, the
umbrella group that has led the protests, of the decision to return
to class. A few classes were held at the university, but most
students stayed away.
   Some classes also were held at Beijing Normal College. Dozens of
other students sat in classrooms studying on their own and said
they expected to resume their normal schedules on Monday.
   The student march Thursday was their sixth in defiance of police
orders since April 17, and one of the largest.
   About 100,000 people, half of them students, converged on
Tiananmen Square, the symbolic seat of power, to mark the 70th
anniversary of China's first student movement. There, they held a
festive rally for greater freedom, cleaner government, a free press
and official recognition of their United Association.
   ``We have to transform China,'' said a 20-year-old student from
the Political Science and Law College.
   Thousands of Beijing residents lined the streets as the students
passed and gave them applause, free drinks and cash donations. ``We
strongly support the students,'' said a man in grimy blue work
clothes.
   At a few intersections marchers had to shove their way through
hundreds of unarmed police lined six deep, but the government
clearly wanted to avoid serious confrontation. The security
presence was smaller than a week earlier, when about 150,000
students and supporters marched on Tiananmen.
   Although authorities had ordered the square closed Thursday, the
police who surrounded it offered no resistance and quickly left
when the students arrived.
   Wu'er Kaixi, one of the leaders of the United Association, said
after the rally that the students' struggle for democracy and
reform has entered a new phase that will focus on spreading their
message through pamphlets and setting up independent newspapers as
an alternative voice to the official media.
   Several official newspapers today carried their fullest accounts
yet of any student protest since the campaign for democracy began.
   ``Beijing's temperature yesterday hit 30 degrees centigrade (86
Fahrenheit), but students streaming with sweat held a march just as
orderly as the last time,'' China Youth News reported.
   It also reported smaller marches in more than 11 cities,
including Shanghai, Xian, Nanjing, Chengdu and Changsha, where
students had marched before in the past few weeks.
   No violence was reported in any of the marches. The Legal Daily
said the Xian students applied for and received police permission
for their demonstration.
   The demonstrations marked the May Fourth Movement of 1919,
China's first student movement. It began in opposition to
concessions granted to the Japanese government during World War I,
and developed into a movement calling for ``Mr. Democracy and Mr.
Science'' to save China.

   Mark Lee first thought about being
an astronaut when he was a third-grader, growing up in small-town
Wisconsin. The Air Force major is the only space rookie aboard
Atlantis.
   Lee is a mission specialist, whose responsibility was ejecting
the Magellan probe from the shuttle's cargo bay.
   After training at NASA for five years, the 36-year-old astronaut
said he didn't really expect any surprises on launch day.
   Lee was born in Viroqua, Wis., where his parents still live.
He's became the hometown hero, and his name dominated posters,
billboards and T-shirts as residents awaited the shuttle launch.
   He invited about 150 Wisconsin friends and relatives to Cape
Canaveral for his first liftoff. Among those watching were his
wife, Diedre, who is in charge of shuttle procurement at the
Johnson Space Center.
   Lee hopes to stay at NASA long enough to help build the planned
space station, walk in space and fly a high-inclination orbit so he
can ``look down on Wisconsin,'' he said in a pre-flight interview.

   Astronaut Mary Cleave, an environmental engineer making her
second shuttle flight, will serve as a kind of ``test case'' as the
smallest person so far to use the new, heavy escape suits
astronauts must wear during launch and landing.
   The bright orange suit added about 90 pounds to the 5-foot-2,
103-pound astronaut.
   She bristled at suggestions she was blazing any new trail as the
first female astronaut to fly since Challenger.
   ``The reason I get irritated ... is that it tends to negate all
the work that women have been doing up to this point,'' she said in
a pre-flight interview.
   Ms. Cleave, 42, graduated from high school in Great Neck, N.Y.,
and received her bachelor's degree from Colorado State University
in 1969. She earned a master's in 1975 and a doctorate in 1979 from
Utah State University.
   She worked as a researcher at the Ecology Center and the Utah
Water Research Laboratory at Utah State from September 1971 to June
1980. She is single, lives with several dogs and cats and is an
outdoor enthusiast.
   Ms. Cleave took a banner for the 4-H of America to replace the
one that astronaut Ellison Onizuka took with him on the Challenger
flight.

   Norman Thagard, who has flown on two previous shuttle flights,
is the Atlantis flight engineer and an enthusiastic supporter of
NASA's unmanned space missions such as the Magellan probe to Venus.
   ``We do these things (planetary missions) to learn more about
ourselves and our own planet,'' Thagard said in a pre-flight
interview. ``Are there some lessons that we can learn from Venus
that will help us? Those are the questions we'll learn from the
planetaries.''
   Thagard, 45, received a doctor of medicine degree from the
University of Texas Southwestern Medical School. He and his wife,
Rex, have three sons.
   In 1966, he entered the Marines Corps Reserve and became a
captain. He flew 163 combat missions in Vietnam. On his first
shuttle mission in June 1983 he conducted various medical tests and
collected data on physiological changes in astronauts.

   Navy Capt. David Walker, 44-year-old commander of the Atlantis
mission, said deployment of the Magellan probe is an essential step
in the quest to explore other planets.
   ``There are probes that can do things that we cannot,'' Walker
said in a pre-flight interview. ``We'll go where these probes have
gone one of these days if we do it right.
   ``And I think it's inevitable that we must. We can't continue to
deplete the resources of this planet and not find some other place
to get resources.''
   The Vietnam-era fighter pilot looked forward to getting back
into space.
   ``It's been a long time coming. It's such a marvelous feeling to
be up there,'' said Walker, who first flew on a shuttle as pilot of
a flight that launched in November 1984.
   He and his wife, Stacy, have two sons.
   Walker took with him several items for friends he met while on a
trip to the Soviet Union, including a picture of Yuri Gagarin, the
Soviet cosmonaut who was the first person to fly in space.

   Air Force Col. Ronald Grabe, an astronaut for nearly eight
years, was making his second shuttle flight as the pilot of
Atlantis.
   Grabe, 43, was born in New York and graduated from high school
there. He received a bachelor's degree from the U.S. Air Force
Academy in 1966 and studied aeronautics as a Fulbright scholar in
Darmstadt, West Germany.
   He flew 200 combat missions in Vietnam and was a test pilot for
the A-7 and F-111 aircraft. His first shuttle flight was as pilot
of Atlantis on its inaugural mission in 1985.
   He and his wife, Marijo, have two daughters.
   The Atlantis mission's primary goal, to deploy the Magellan
probe that later will map the surface of Venus, should yield a
``bonanza'' of information to scientists, he said in a pre-flight
interview.
   ``I think it's important that we get this sort of an effort back
off the ground,'' Grabe said. ``It's an area in which the United
States has been at the forefront and we need to maintain our
leadership role in planetary science.''

<TEXT>
   A new newspaper focusing on the homeless has
hit the streets with the aim of inspiring the nation's homeless and
opening the public's eyes to their problems.
   ``This is their newspaper. ... All homeless are not inhabitants
of skid row. They have feelings, self-worth and the desire to have
a place to call home,'' said Victor Halsey, editor and founder of
the monthly ``Freedom from the Streets,'' which made its debut
Thursday.
   Halsey said his long-term goals are to get the homeless involved
in the newspaper with contributions of art, poetry and prose. With
a staff of four, the paper also will showcase success stories of
some who have triumphed over homelessness to become self-sufficient.
   ``The best psychologists in the world are the ones who have been
through it,'' he said. ``A homeless person writing about
homelessness picks up the true feelings of despair.''
   Some 8,000 copies of the paper's first edition have been
printed, Halsey said. He planned to distribute the papers free to
local shelters, as well as offering $10 annual subscriptions to
social agencies across the country. Halsey said he hopes the paper
will be self-supporting with advertising.
   Halsey, who was homeless himself for two years, said he was
lucky enough to enter a treatment program four years ago to
overcome alcoholism and get himself back on his feet. Before that,
``I was riding the rails. ... I stopped running and starting
dealing with my realities.''
   Now he's taking classes at Metropolitan State University in
Minneapolis and working on a bachelor's degree in chemistry.
   About 3,000 people in the Minneapolis area are homeless and
those figures climb to about 5 million on a national level, he
estimated.
   Lawmakers on federal and local levels need to start tackling the
problem by building more affordable houses, said Halsey.
   ``The (Reagan) administration said people were homeless by
choice,'' he said. ``We have to overcome that rhetoric, that
philosophy. ... People are sleeping on heat grates within visible
distance of the White House.''

<HEAD>Winner of $7.1 Million Lotto Says He'll Pay $25,000 Back Child Support</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lottery millionaire from Colorado has decided to
ante up $25,000 in back child support to avoid prosecution by
Massachusetts authorities, according to his attorney.
   Albert Tecci, who won a $7.1 million Lotto jackpot in Colorado
on April 22, failed to pay both court-ordered and voluntary support
for his children, who live in the blue-collar town of Revere, just
outside of Boston, state child support officials said. The boys,
who turn 8 and 9 this month, live with their mother on public
assistance.
   Several hours after a felony fugitive arrest warrant was issued
in Chelsea District Court on Thursday, state officials said they
reached an agreement with Tecci's attorney in Denver for him to
send the $25,000 in back child support and the warrant would be
withdrawn.
   State Department of Revenue spokeswoman Karen Schwartzman said
the state will likely lift the criminal charges facing Tecci once
the money is received and a new child support order is instituted
that will allow the children to get off public assistance and
``reflect Tecci's current standard of living.''
   State officials were tipped off to Tecci's lottery win last
Thursday by a local resident who read an account of the Colorado
drawing in a newspaper, according to Schwartzman.
   The back support dated from 1981, Schwartzman said. Tecci had
agreed to voluntarily pay support until 1986, when he and his wife
were divorced. Under the terms of the divorce, Tecci was ordered to
pay regular support.
   Tecci faced penalties of up to a $10,000 fine and five years in
prison.
   Tecci and his fiancee, Cheryl Penney, who used some of their
laundry money to buy the winning ticket, stayed incommunicado for
several days after the winning number was announced, consulting
with a lawyer and celebrating in grand style, before stepping
forward April 25 to claim the first installment of $134,725. They
will receive 25 annual installments.
   Tecci said while claiming the prize at a news conference that
winning the lottery hadn't changed anything, ``other than instead
of buying $12 dinners, we buy $1,200 dinners.''
   The pair said they would use the money to open a restaurant.
   Tecci, a free-lance public relations and political consultant,
has been working for the Street Smart program designed to help
inner-city youth. Tecci has said some of the jackpot would go to
benefit the program.
   In a similar situation, Maryland authorities have seized all or
part of the jackpots of 203 state lottery winners to pay overdue
child support.
   At least one winner lost a $10,000 jackpot, Maryland Department
of Human Resouces spokesman J.C. Shay said Thursday. In all,
$226,000 in delinquent child support has been collected by the
department since the lottery interception program began six months
ago.
   A 1987 bill authorized the state to seize lottery prizes of
winners who are $150 or more behind in child support payments.

<HEAD>Study: Women on Pill More Than Four Years Risk Breast Cancer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Young women who take birth control pills for more
than four years run a significantly higher risk of breast cancer,
according to a study published today in a prestigious British
medical journal.
   Researchers were quoted in The Lancet as saying that among women
35 or younger, they found a 43 percent increase in the risk of
breast cancer after four years of pill use and a 74 percent
increase after eight years.
   They called on doctors to tell women about the possible risks of
breast cancer before they prescribe contraceptive pills, but they
did not advocate avoiding oral contraceptives.
   However, Clair Chilvers of the Institute of Cancer Research in
London, one of the authors of the study, advised women to aim for
the lowest-dose pill available and stay on it for the shortest
possible time.
   ``Women who are not having intercourse should stop taking it,''
she said Thursday at a London news conference.
   The study is the most comprehensive look at the pill and breast
cancer ever undertaken in Britain and one of the largest in the
world.
   The researchers were quoted in the medical weekly as saying the
risks of taking the pill had to be kept in perspective.
   ``Breast cancer is uncommon below age 36, the age group that was
studied. Only one woman in 500 develops the disease before age 36,
so even a 70 percent increase in risk would only put the chances of
developing breast cancer by this age up to about one in 300,'' the
researchers said.
   Earlier studies on the relationship between the pill and breast
cancer have conflicted. Last January, a U.S. Food and Drug
Administration committee of experts declared that recent research
on possible links between the pill and breast cancer was
inconclusive.
   The British study involved 755 British women under age 36 who
were diagnosed as having breast cancer between the beginning of
1982 and the end of 1985, and an equal number of similar but
cancer-free women.
   The researchers, from Oxford University and two leading British
cancer charities, said they still could not answer the ``crucial
question'' of whether the increased risk persisted after age 36.
They said they are undertaking a study on women ages 36 to 45 ``to
help resolve this vital issue.''
   ``The most consistent interpretation of our results and those
from previous studies is perhaps that the excess risk is transient
and diminishes or disappears at older ages,'' they said.
   The researchers said their study included only those women with
breast cancer who had the opportunity to use oral contraceptives
from the start of their reproductive lives. Since the pill has been
available in Britain since the early 1960s, they decided to include
only women age 36 and under at the time their breast cancer was
diagnosed.
   The researchers said 91 percent of the women with breast cancer
and 89 percent of the comparison group had used the pill at some
time.
   The relative risks were similar for women who used the pill
before and after their first full-term pregnancy, the researchers
said.
   Britain's Family Planning Association and National Association
of Planning Doctors said the new study ``does not clarify the
continuing debate about the pill and breast cancer risks.''
   The two organizations said women now on the pill who are
concerned about the findings should discuss their cases with their
doctors. They said the risks had to be balanced against the pill's
benefits in protecting women against ovarian and other types of
cancer.

   It should be enough to make Popeye's
friend, Wimpy, glad.
   Never mind paying on Tuesday, Saturday is the day to be in El
Reno when they cook and eat the ``Big One.'' That's what
townspeople are calling what they say is going to be the world's
largest onion-fried hamburger.
   ``El Reno is famous for onion-fried burgers,'' explained Carolyn
Howard, director of the Main Street Project, which has organized
various other events the same day aimed at revitalizing downtown.
   The ``Big One'' will consist of 150 pounds of meat formed into
an 8{-foot patty and 150 pounds of onions.
   A full-scale test run was held last month and everything went
well ``except the bun ended up with the bready side outside,'' Ms.
Howard said Wednesday. But, she promised, there won't be any such
hitches on Saturday.
   ``We have asked all the guys who ever worked for burger
establishments here since 1926 to come back and work as alums,''
she said. ``About 20 of them are coming in and will help get it
ready.''
   It will take about 45 minutes to pat out the hamburger and get
it ready, and then about 30 minutes to cook it, she said.
   The bun is being baked by an Oklahoma City bakery and will be
delivered on a wrecker with a roll-out carrier, she said.

   The last winners of North America's
largest lottery jackpot have come forward to claim their prize.
   A retired tugboat captain and his family on Thursday presented
Pennsylvania lottery officials with what is believed to be the 14th
and final winning ticket that qualified for a share of the $115.5
million Super 7 jackpot.
   Lottery officials expect to have some of the tickets from the
April 26 drawing validated and to start issuing checks by next
week. Each winning ticket is worth $8.3 million, payable in 26
annual installments of $317,524.
   ``It took a while for it to dawn on me that we had the winning
ticket,'' Henry G. Ronneberg told reporters after he and his family
turned in the ticket Thursday.
   His wife, Barbara, added: ``We were numb.''
   Ronnenberg said their annual share will be split with their son
and daughter and one of their grandchildren.
   ``They're just struggling,'' Barbara Ronneberg, 67, said of her
children.
   Ronneberg, 66, originally from Norway, has been in the United
States since he married in 1945. He worked on tugboats in New York
City Harbor from 1947 until 1984 for the Moran Towing and
Transportation Co. and served in Norway's merchant marines during
World War II.
   After his retirement, Ronneberg and his wife moved to the rural
Pennsylvania farmhouse in Wilcox where she was born.
   Ronneberg said he thought he might use part of the winnings to
visit his mother, Gunda, 89, in Norway.

   Lord Martonmere, who served 33 years in
Britain's Parliament and went on to be governor of Bermuda, has
died. He was 82.
   Martonmere died in his sleep Wednesday at his home here, said
his daughter, Loretta Rogers of Toronto.
   Martonmere, the former Sir Roland Robinson, had divided his time

   He was born John Roland Robinson on Feb. 22, 1907, in Blackpool,
England.
   Martonmere attended Trinity Hall at Cambridge University and
served in Britain's Parliament from 1931 until 1964, when he was
appointed governor of Bermuda. He held that post until 1972.
   Martonmere is survived by his wife, the former Maysie Gasque,
Mrs. Rogers and seven grandchildren.
   Funeral services were scheduled for Saturday in Lyford Cay.

   It was Mother's Day at Arlington Stadium
when first lady Barbara Bush threw out the first pitch for her
son's Texas Rangers before a baseball game against the New York
Yankees.
   Mrs. Bush, surrounded by Secret Service agents and about 35

ovation from the crowd of 26,898 Thursday night. She was
accompanied to the mound by three children enrolled in local

   George W. Bush, who led a group of investors who purchased the
team March 18, presented his mother with a Rangers jacket that had
``Barbara'' stitched across the back. He also asked her to deliver
one embossed ``Mr. President'' to his father, who is a staunch

   Once on the pitcher's mound, Mrs. Bush dug in her high heels,
looked for the sign and laughed.
   Rangers catcher Geno Petralli was standing behind the plate, a
bit too far for the first lady's arm.
   She motioned for him to come out about halfway, then fired a
high fastball that Petralli reached up and grabbed.
   Bush said the toss was his mother's ``first major league

<HEAD>Despite `Zero' Observed Risk, Rubella Vaccine Inadvisable During
Pregnancy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seventeen years of study of rubella vaccinations
on pregnant women show chances of fetal infection are small, but
health experts warn that women still should be vaccinated long
before they get pregnant.
   Although rubella, once known as German measles, is mild in most
cases, congenital rubella syndrome _ rubella at birth _ can cause
blindness, retardation and heart defects.
   Since the rubella vaccine was licensed in 1969, the national
Centers for Disease Control have recommended against pregnant women
getting the vaccine because of the possible risk of passing rubella
on to their babies.
   No cases of congenital rubella were detected in the children of
305 women who participated in a study from 1971 to 1988, the CDC
said. The women were susceptible to rubella and received rubella
vaccine within three months of conception.
   ``The observed risk for CRS following rubella vaccination
continues to be zero,'' the Atlanta-based CDC said, adding that
researchers in West Germany and Great Britain also have found no
vaccine-related congenital rubella syndrome.
   However, the virus in rubella vaccine has been shown to cross
the placenta and infect the fetus; one study shows an infection
rate of 3 percent.
   ``Thus ... because the theoretical risk to the fetus, however
small, cannot be absolutely ruled out ... pregnancy remains a
contraindication to rubella vaccination,'' the CDC said.
   The CDC's Immunization Practices Advisory Committee continues to
recommend that while ``reasonable precautions'' should be taken not
to vaccinate pregnant women, ``inadvertent vaccination of a
pregnant woman should not be a reason in itself to consider
interruption of pregnancy.''
   ``Nothing (in the way of vaccine-related CRS) has been observed,
but it's still a theoretical concern, and it's been shown the virus
can be transmitted through the placenta,'' said Dr. Paul
Stehr-Green, a CDC immunization specialist. ``So the conservative
argument is that the contraindication is a reasonable precaution.''
   The CDC recommends rubella vaccinations for women who are
potentially susceptible to the disease.
   Rubella, a once common childhood disease, was reported in only
221 cases in the United States last year. There was one case of
congenital rubella syndrome in 1988.

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two months of fighting for the
strategic city of Jalalabad has demonstrated the unexpected
tenacity of the Afghan armed forces and exposed weaknesses in the
divided guerrilla opposition.
   Each day the Soviet-backed government holds the provincial
capital, the more confident it becomes it can withstand a guerrilla
siege and force the insurgents and their Western supporters to
negotiate peace.
   For nearly 10 years, the guerrillas _ known as mujahedeen _
waged their holy war against the Soviet army, which entered
Afghanistan in 1979 to prop up the Marxist government. The enemy
was an invading superpower to them and the battle lines were clear.
   But now the Soviets are gone, and the guerrillas have come down
from the mountains to the rocky plains of Jalalabad. They are
trying to move from hit-and-run attacks to full-scale conventional
warfare in the largest and bloodiest offensive of the 11-year civil
war.
   So far, neither side is winning.
   Diplomats in Kabul have said 7,500 to 12,500 insurgents and
government soldiers have died or been wounded during the eight-week
siege. There are no estimates on casualties among Jalalabad's
civilian population, which once numbered about 64,000.
   The guerrillas have pounded the eastern city with as many as
16,000 rockets a day. The forces of President Najib have responded
with long-range Scud missiles and have dispatched MiG-21 and MiG-27
jets to pound guerrilla camps.
   Jalalabad and its magnificent gardens and palaces has been
virtually destroyed. Refugees are fleeing the carnage by foot and
on flatbed trucks.
   The mujahedeen are fighting as fiercely as ever, but with little
coordination or military discipline.
   Seven guerrilla factions set up a government-in-exile in
Pakistan in February but still do not have a cohesive ideology or
consistent popular support.
   Meanwhile, government forces have proved they can fight
effectively without Soviet troops to back them up. The soldiers are
driven in part by fear of death or torture if captured by the
insurgents.
   When the Soviet army rolled into Afghanistan in December 1979,
the United States took advantage of Pakistan's relationship with
guerrillas who had taken refuge there.
   Washington sent weapons to Pakistan's military intelligence
service. The Pakistanis delivered them to the guerrilla leaders,
who handed them out to their field commanders.
   But the arrangements created rivalries among the insurgents and
undermined efforts to unite the resistance.
   ``Until Jalalabad, few in the West listened to complaints about
the resistance. While the Soviets were in Afghanistan, it didn't
matter. Now it does,'' said one diplomat with ties to both sides.
   When the U.N.-sponsored accord calling for the Soviet withdrawal
was signed last year, the lack of a coherent guerrilla
government-in-exile became a prime concern, and it was left to
Pakistani generals to shape one.
   The Soviets completed their withdrawal on Feb. 15, and the
Pakistani military began pushing the mujahedeen to attack Jalalabad
so they would have a place to set up their government.
   Diplomats in Kabul say the siege was orchestrated primarily by
Pakistan's military and based on the theory that the city would
fall quickly and pave the way for the final push on Kabul, the
capital.
   Several insurgent leaders boasted that Jalalabad would be theirs
within a day. But their predictions proved wrong and their
self-imposed deadline was pushed back to weeks, then finally months.
   Some observers say it is time the United States changed
strategies if it wants to lead in negotiating peace.
   ``If the mujahedeen and the Kabul government reach a compromise
with Washington's help, it will be a credit for the United
States,'' said another diplomat who also spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   ``But if the Americans work through Pakistan, their policy will
fail. The Afghans and the Pakistanis have been enemies for a long
time. The Pakistanis will just push on to fight, and the Afghan
nation will be finished. If that happens, the United States will
lose all the credit it has earned.''

<TEXT>
   Criticizing the health care provisions in
President Bush's budget, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis renewed
his call for universal health insurance while commemorating the
125th anniversary of his alma mater.
   Dukakis, who last spoke at Swarthmore College while seeking the
Democratic presidential nomination, told about 400 people, mostly
Swarthmore students, that plans to cut into Medicare are
``unconscionable and unacceptable.''
   He said the budget would cut Medicare by $2.7 billion.
   ``These cuts, if approved by the Congress, will continue to
shift costs to private insurance plans, a trend that is already
raising the cost to employers, who have to cut benefits, increase
co-payments and deductibles and require larger employee
contributions,'' he said.
   Dukakis graduated in 1955 from Swarthmore, whose charter was
approved by the Pennsylvania Legislature 125 years ago Thursday.
The liberal arts college, about 10 miles southwest of Philadelphia,
has an enrollment of about 1,320.
   Before his speech, Dukakis ate dinner with old classmates,
professors and students who campaigned for him.
   ``My only regret is we're not doing this on the East Lawn of the
White House,'' he said.

<HEAD>Canada Opens 9-Mile Rail Tunnel Under Glacier National Park</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROGERS PASS, B.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   North America's longest rail tunnel, a
nine-mile stretch under Glacier National Park, has opened to link
Canada's coal and mineral-producing hinterland with the West Coast
and the Pacific Rim countries.
   The tunnel was inaugurated Thursday in a ceremony accented by
the sound of bagpipes and attended by rail executives,
industrialists, politicians and some of the 1,100 railway workers
who worked on the $422 million project.
   The new route, completed ahead of schedule and $84 million under
budget, ends the cumbersome practice of adding extra locomotives to
trains that had to negotiate 4,000-foot Rogers Pass and should
increase westbound capacity by as much as 60 per cent, authorities
say.
   Major improvements, including the Mount Macdonald Tunnel,
reduced the steepness so that pushers are no longer needed on the
southeastern British Columbia route.
   ``This is the biggest thing the railway has done since the
building of the transcontinental,'' said Barry Scott, chairman and
chief executive officer of CP Rail.
   CP Rail, a subsidiary of Canadian Pacific Ltd., can now run
four-locomotive freight trains from Calgary to Vancouver and,
without the aid of the pusher trains, increase the number of
freights through Rogers Pass daily from 15 to 24.
   ``After nearly 104 years of railroading in these Selkirk
Mountains, we have finally tamed the geography _ or at least as
much as man is ever likely to do,'' said Scott.
   The project involved double-tracking the CP Rail main line
through Rogers Pass. It was the last of four double-tracking and
grade-reduction projects undertaken by the railway in British
Columbia and Alberta.
   Lighter eastbound trains through Rogers Pass will use the old
track and the Connaught Tunnel, which opened in 1916. The new route
also will be used by passenger trains.
   CP Rail officials say the project will have a significant impact
on the ability to move export commodities such as grain, coal,
sulphur and potash to the West Coast and the Pacific Rim.
   ``This was built for the future,'' said Barry Scott, a senior
railway spokesman. ``It's solid advance planning.''
   CP Rail hopes to pay for it over 20 to 30 years depending on
revenues, but will realize savings immediately from the elimination
of about 20 pusher locomotives from service.

   Vice president Dan Quayle, heading
home from his 12-day trip abroad, walked along an oil-soaked Alaska
beach and told workers ``it's going to be an enormous effort'' to
clean up the Prince William Sound.
   ``I've been very impressed with the number of people, the number
of ships and the magnitude of the cleanup,'' Quayle said of efforts
to remove oil the Exxon tanker Valdez spilled into waters off the
scenic Alaska coast March 24.
   Quayle stopped here before flying today to Washington, where he
was to brief President Bush at lunch on his 12-day trip to five
Pacific and Asian nations, his second trip abroad for the
administration.
   He was to meet Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper, a Democrat, and more
than a dozen mayors and representatives of native groups after
midnight at Elmendorf Air Force Base before beginning the final leg
of his trip.
   Wearing orange coveralls, Quayle joined Transportation Secretary
Samuel Skinner and Adm. Paul Yost, the Coast guard Commandant, late
Thursday in a tour late Thursday of one of the areas most
critically damaged by the 10 million gallons of crude dumped into
the sound.
   The vice president watched about 100 workers wearing
oil-drenched slickers as they washed the sticky black fluid off
rocks on this island reeking with the smell of petroleum.
   He noted the slick has affected 300 miles of shoreline. ``It's
going to be an enormous effort,'' he said of the cleanup.
   Quayle did not discuss specifics of the cleanup or criticism of
efforts by Exxon, which has come under heavy fire for failing to
move quickly and effectively.
   Before the tour, Quayle met with residents of Cordova, a
commercial fishing community. Fisherman R.J. Kopshak said the
townspeople ``appreciate the fact that he's here,'' even though
Quayle arrived six weeks after the spill occurred.

<TEXT>
   Pro-government candidate Carlos Duque
urged 100,000 followers to use their vote in the presidential
election as a weapon ``to cut off the hands of those who sold
Panama for $10 million.''
   Speaking Thursday in May 5th Plaza at his final major rally
before Sunday's election, Duque said though that he was willing to
resolve Panamanian differences with the United States ``on a basis
of respect and non-intervention.''
   Duque has leaned heavily on allegations Washington authorized
$10 million for the opposition and pointed to it as a U.S. attempt
to make Panama ``just another star on the American flag.''
   Duque faces opposition candidate Guillermo Endara in a race to
succeed acting President Manuel Solis Palma. The balloting,
however, is viewed as a referendum on strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega, the Defense Forces commander indicted in Florida last year
on drug trafficking charges.
   International observers include two former U.S. presidents who
planned to monitor the balloting. Despite government insistence
that voting will be free and fair, the opposition and Washington
claim that the pro-government alliance will steal the election.
   Alleged American attempts to thwart Panamanian dignity and
independence have been rallying points of the pro-government
coalition throughout the campaign.
   ``Panama cannot be bought for $10 million nor for all the gold
in the world,'' Duque told a cheering crowd that waved colorful
party flags and stood under banners reading, among other
things,``USA: The World Is Watching You; Hands Off Panama!''
   Duque said the eight-party National Liberation Alliance he
represents is the only group that can guarantee stability, bring
together the Panamanian people and deal effectively with other
countries.
   Government employees, who make up about 20 percent of the work
force, were given the afternoon off to attend the rally and
thousands were trucked or bused to the capital from around Panama.
   Panamanian law mandates all campaigning end tonight at midnight.
   The Democratic Opposition Alliance held its final rally
Wednesday, saying Sunday's vote is ``the last peaceful opportunity
for change'' and hinting they would take to the streets if the
results appear rigged.
   There is no official U.S. observer delegation, although former
President Gerald Ford arrived Thursday at Howard Air Base near the
capital. Former President Jimmy Carter and the rest of the
delegation he heads, under the auspices of the Council of Freely
Elected Heads of Governments, were to due arrive today.
   There were reports from Washington that President Bush would
send a delegation despite Panamanian statements that an official
observer delegation would not be welcome.
   Panama has been under military rule since 1968 and has had only
one presidential election since then, in 1984. The opposition
contends a return to democracy in Panama is not possible with
Noriega as the head of the military.
   Noriega has denied the drug trafficking charges, calling them an
excuse to get rid of him in favor of someone more willing to
respect American wishes, especially regarding the Panama Canal.
   Under 1977 treaties signed by Carter and the late Panamanian
dictator Omar Torrijos, the canal is to be taken over by Panama at
the end of the century.
   Panama's government contends the opposition alliance will stop
or delay the Panamanian takeover of the waterway.
   In February last year Noriega allies in the National Assembly
ousted President Eric Delvalle, who tried to fire Noriega after the
drug indictments. Washington still recognizes Delvalle, now in the
United States, as Panama's legitimate ruler.
   The United States imposed economic sanctions against Panama last
year to try to force Noriega out.
   The opposition press has been closed for more than a year in
Panama. Thursday's pro-government rally was widely broadcast while
Wednesday's opposition rally, which drew a similar crowd, was not.

<TEXT>
   Newspaper editorials across the nation today generally applauded
Oliver North's conviction as showing no one is above the law, but
some papers said the former national security aide was persecuted
for political ends.
   ``The verdict should remind future officials in the executive
branch that they are not above the law, however just they consider
their cause and however much backing they enjoy from their
superiors,'' said the Rocky Mountain News in Denver.
   The Star Tribune in Minneapolis, Minn., said the jury ``rendered
a service to common sense and common decency,'' and The News &amp;
Observer of Raleigh, N.C., said North's conviction on three felony
charges ``reaffirms the American principle that even high
government officials are accountable to the law.''
   But some papers said North was a victim of political motivations.
   ``The offenses North was found guilty of were woven of political
gossamer and fashioned by a frustrated opposition,'' said The
Indianapolis Star. ``North is guilty of one thing, of
over-zealousness in the service of his country, his president, and
liberty. He should be pardoned.''
   North was found guilty of aiding and abetting an obstruction of
Congress as well as shredding and altering documents in November
1986 and of accepting a $13,800 home security system in mid-1986
from Iran-Contra co-defendant Richard Secord, whom North had
enlisted to run arms to the Contras.
   He was acquitted of nine other criminal charges.
   Many newspapers said North did not emerge from the trial as a
villain, but his conviction was a victory for the judicial system.
   ``The verdict is satisfying not as a triumph for opponents of
Mr. North's policies but as a vindication of law and orderly
process; that, and a solemn judgment that the law, however
politically disagreeable, must be respected by its servants,'' said
The New York Times.
   The Dallas Morning News said although North was found guilty on
just three counts, ``that was enough to make the all-important
constitutional point that even heroes must obey the law.''
   In one of the strongest editorials, The Atlanta Constitution
said North had a gift for appearing sincere ``and was a clever
embroiderer of fictions. In the surer light of the courtroom,
however, he was less than convincing. Ollie North, American hero,
is now a convicted felon.''
   Other newspapers expressed a different viewpoint, questioning in
particular the expense to prosecute North.
   ``Given the multimillion-dollar investigation and prosecution,
we would say that it is the taxpayers who are going to be paying
for the zealotry of Mr. Walsh and congressional liberals,'' said
the Richmond (Va.) Times-Dispatch.
   The Boston Herald said the trial proved ``that if you spend $13
million to prosecute one man, you're bound to get a conviction on
something.''
   The Daily News in New York said the verdict may have long-term
consequences for the executive branch of government.
   ``Oliver North's shadow long will hang over the sort of
free-wheeling, defiantly extra-legal dealing that North engaged in,
proudly. And that, ultimately, may be of far more consequence to
the health of American democracy than any of the damage done by
North's shallow indifference to the law.''
   Whether the nation will ever learn the full story of the
Iran-Contra scandal is still in doubt, according to The Arizona
Republic in Phoenix.
   ``The North trial, unfortunately, cast little new light on the
Iran-contra fiasco. The misguided scheme to aid secretly and
illegally the Nicaraguan Contras _ which turned into a scam to swap
arms to Iran for American hostages in Beirut, with the profits
plowed back into the anti-Sandinista cause _ remain a frustrating
whodunit, a pulp mystery with a convoluted plot and the last page
torn out of the book.''

   A soldier went berserk in the
southern Philippines, killing six people and wounding 14 before
committing suicide, a military report said today.
   According to the Philippine Constabulary headquarters in Manila,
the victims were killed in two attacks on the outskirts of Cagayan
de Oro in Misamis Oriental province, about 500 miles southeast of
Manila.
   Constable 2nd Class Ramon Cabisada, armed with an M-16 rifle and
grenade launcher, opened fire Wednesday afternoon on a house in the
village of Upper Gusa, killing six and wounding 11, the military
said.
   Early Thursday, Cabisada traveled to the neighboring village of
Lower Gusa where he fired on another house with his grenade
launcher and wounded three people, according to the report.
   Cabisada then went to his boarding house nearby and shot himself
to death, the report said.
   It did not give a reason for the attacks.

<HEAD>Tornadoes In Texas, Heavy Rains In Louisiana</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Tornadoes touched down near a number of Texas towns early today,
causing damage to property but no serious injuries, authorities
said, while heavy rains drenched Louisiana.
   A tornado at Possum Kingdom Lake in Texas damaged roofs on about
50 homes.
   Ten empty coal cars of a train were derailed near the Texas
Panhandle community of Dawn, possibly because of a tornado,
authorities said. No one was injured.
   ``We've had some softball-size hail,'' said a dispatcher in the
Johnson County Sheriff's office in Cleburne, which is 45 miles
southwest of Dallas. The National Weather Service described the
Cleburne hail as baseball sized.
   Similar sized hail fell near Bossier City, Louisiana. Smaller
hail was reported elsewhere in Louisiana and in Oklahoma and Texas.
   In the northern Louisiana city of Monroe, hail forced Lexington
Elementary School officials on Thursday to quickly move students
inside. The school suffered extensive damage.
   ``It hit our windows on the north side and we went into our
drills and got the kids inside,'' said principal Charles Roaner.
   Winds gusted to 80 mph in Granbury, Texas, a town of 5,000
residents 20 miles southwest of Fort Worth, damaging many mobile
homes, authorities said.
   Gusts also were reported to near 80 mph at Wichita Falls, Texas,
and 80 to 90 mph at Eldorado, Oklahoma. There were a large number
of reports of winds to near 100 mph from Dallas County, Texas, to
near Waco.
   Heavy rains _ 3 to 4 inches in spans of 45 minutes _ fell in
parts of Louisiana.
   Shreveport, La., had some street flooding after an inch of rain
fell in 30 minutes. Monroe, La., had more than 4 inches of rain in
the six hours ending at 2 a.m. EDT, while Shreveport, La., and Fort
Worth, Texas, had more than 2 inches. New Orleans had more than an
inch of rain in the same period.
   The high temperature in the nation Thursday was 110 degrees in
Laughlin, Nev.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms extending
from southeast Texas across much of the Mississippi Valley, the
Great Lakes, the Ohio Valley, the eastern Gulf Coast region to much
of the Atlantic Coast. Thunderstorms were to be most numerous from
southeast Texas across the lower Mississippi Valley and the
Tennessee Valley, the central and southern Appalachians to the
middle Atlantic Coast. Strong and gusty winds were forecast across
the middle and upper Mississippi Valley and western portions of the
upper Great Lakes.
   High temperatures were expected in the 30s over northern
Minnesota; in the 40s and 50s from the upper Missouri Valley and
the central Rockies across the northern Plains, northern Nebraska
and the upper Mississippi Valley to the upper Great Lakes states;
in the 80s from Florida and southern Georgia to the eastern and
central Gulf Coast region; in the 80s and 90s over Texas except the
Panhandle, across the southern Rockies and the southern Plateau to
inland California; and to 100 to 105 degrees over the desert
Southwest. The remainder of the nation was to have high
temperatures generally in the 60s and 70s.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 27
degrees at Warroad, Minn., to 83 degrees at Blythe, Calif.

   The mental condition of the Central Park jogger
who was raped and beaten into a coma last month continues to
improve, but doctors say her recovery is threatened by a 106-degree
fever.
   Meanwhile, Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward suggested Thursday
that cameras be placed in desolate areas of Central Park to alert
police to the presence of roving gangs like the one that allegedly
attacked the woman jogger.
   At Metropolitan Hospital Thursday, doctors said the rape victim
called her father ``Dad'' for the first time since the attack.
   ``We do feel, mental status-wise, that she is improving,'' said
Dr. Robert S. Kurtz, assistant chief of surgery. ``On the other
hand, we are obviously concerned about the source of the fever.''
   The 28-year-old woman, who remained in a coma for two weeks
after the April 19 attack, regained consciousness Tuesday, speaking
in a hoarse whisper to relatives and staff members. Her condition
remained critical despite her progress, Kurtz said.
   The woman's parents have maintained a vigil at the hospital
since the attack.
   Six teens have been indicted on charges of attempted murder,
rape, sodomy and assault in the case that has brought an outpouring
of concern from around the city.
   The woman, an investment banker, was on her regular jog through
Central Park when the mob pounced on her.
   The alleged attackers were members of a teen-age gang of more
than 30 youths who went to the park for a night of ``wilding'' _
random attacks on anyone they encountered while roaming the area,
police said.

<HEAD>Man Convicted In Rape Of Disabled Girl To Go Free On Technicality</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 13-year-old with muscular dystrophy
who was able to scream and push her attacker while she was raped
wasn't ``physically helpless'' under law, according to a court
ruling that sets the man free.
   The Florida Supreme Court decided Thursday that Lee Curtis
Davis, who's serving a life sentence for the crime, should not have
been charged with rape against a physically helpless victim.
   The 4-1 ruling upholds an appeals court decision that Davis
should go free because he was prosecuted under the wrong law.
   Although the girl, who uses a wheelchair, cannot move her legs,
testimony showed she screamed for help and tried to push the man
away as he raped her twice in the 1985 attack. By law, the high
court said she doesn't fit the definition of physically helpless.
   Davis, 46, was sentenced in 1987 as a habitual offender and
remains at the Marion Correctional Institution. Court officials
said he could be freed within 30 days.
   He cannot be tried again for the crime because of the U.S.
Constitution's provision against double jeopardy.
   ``This was our court of last resort in this case. The decision
leaves us with the conviction overturned,'' said Assistant Attorney
General Charles Corces in Tampa. ``There can be no more appeals.''
   In February, the 2nd District Court of Appeal in Lakeland ruled
that Davis was tried under the wrong sexual battery law.
   The victim was not ``physically helpless'' as defined in the
rarely used law that Davis was prosecuted under because she was not
``asleep, unconscious or physically unable to communicate her
unwillingness to the act,'' the appeal court ruled.
   The alleged rape occurred in Davis' Lake Alfred home, where he
was taking care of the girl.
   Ron Toward, the attorney who won Davis' appeal, said Thursday
that he was happy for his client.

<HEAD>Izvestia Says Soviet Troops Involved in 1979 Afghan Coup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet troops were involved in a coup in
Afghanistan before the new leader invited Soviet soldiers to enter
that country in 1979, a Soviet historian said in the government
newspaper Izvestia.
   ``I think the time has come to tell the whole truth, however
bitter it is,'' historian Y.V. Gankovsky said Thursday. ``Abroad,
books have been published on the subject. Silence from us only
causes rumors and speculation.''
   Western sources previously have reported that Soviet forces
moved into Afghanistan before leader Babrak Karmal, considered a
Soviet puppet, issued his invitation.
   But this is the first indication in a Soviet publication that
the Soviet Union may have engineered that invitation.
   Speaking of the attack on the president's palace on Dec. 27,
1979, which killed Hafizullah Amin and led to Karmal's takeover,
Gankovsky said, ``From conversations with our officers, I learned
that our unit, which was included in the limited Soviet military
contingent, also took part in the operation.''
   ``The clash did not take long,'' Gankovsky added. ``And, with
the exception of Amin's personal guards, nobody even made an
attempt to defend the regime he headed.''
   According to a book by Western journalist Jan Goodwin, ``Caught
in the Crossfire,'' Amin had just rejected a Soviet demand that he
either resign or make a formal request for Soviet troops to
intervene in Afghanistan.
   The next day, Babrak Karmal claimed power in a broadcast on
Kabul Radio, and asked for Soviet ``political, moral, military and
economic assistance,'' a request repeatedly cited by the Soviets as
the reason for their intervention.
   Goodwin says Karmal was actually in Tashkent in the Soviet Union
at the time and the broadcast was made using a prerecorded tape.
   Gankovsky also argued with reported statements by Gen. V.I.
Vanenikov that the intervention was necessary to protect the Soviet
Union.
   ``Of course, having a hostile government in power in a
neighboring country could not be satisfying to us. But it did not
follow that we had to react to the situation the way we did in
1979,'' he said.
   ``Political, diplomatic steps could have been taken,'' he said.
   Gankovsky also repeated earlier reports that the decision to
send troops to Afghanistan was taken by former President Leonid
Brezhnev and a handful of others. Former Soviet Foreign Minister
Andrei Gromyko has said Brezhnev's opposition to Amin was partially
motived by fury over the murder of Amin's precedessor, Marxist
President Nur Mohammed Taraki.
   ``Taraki's murder has to be taken into account when considering
the steps taken by the Soviet Union in Afghanistan,'' Gromyko told
the London Observer in a recent interview.

   A man already serving a life sentence
has been convicted of 13 counts of aggravated murder in the
abduction, torture and stabbing deaths of six women.
   Dayton Leroy Rogers put his head in his right hand, shook it,
and said ``No'' repeatedly as the first guilty verdict was read
Thursday night in Clackamas County Circuit Court.
   He covered his head with his hands, leaned forward onto the
defense table and looked away from the jurors as they individually
were asked their verdict.
   Rogers was charged with killing six women after kidnapping and
torturing them _ a total of 12 counts of aggravated murder under
state law. A 13th count of aggravated murder held that Rogers
killed one of the victims during sexual abuse.
   The conviction carries a sentence of life in prison or death by
lethal injection. Jurors will determine the sentence in the trial's
penalty phase, beginning May 22.
   Prosecutor Andrejs I. Eglitis refused to comment on the case
after the verdict was returned, saying the penalty phase still
needed to be heard.
   Lotus Flynn, the mother of victim Christine Lotus Adams, said
her family wasn't sure if it supported the death penalty, but was
glad Rogers was convicted.
   Rogers already is serving a life sentence for stabbing to death
a Portland prostitute in a suburban parking lot in 1987.
   The jurors heard 127 prosecution witnesses over five weeks,
while the defense called no witnesses.
   Rogers was convicted in connection with the deaths of the women,
all known or suspected prostitutes who were stabbed repeatedly in
the back. Investigators testified that feet were sawed from three
of the bodies.
   Their bodies, and a seventh that has not been identified, were
found in late August and early September 1987 on a hillside near
Molalla, about 30 miles southeast of Portland.

   Coffee is $2 a cup, but it is not the
prices that have residents of this northeastern Pennsylvania
borough up in arms over Dad's Coffee Shop.
   It's the topless waitresses serving the coffee.
   About 1,100 of the borough's 6,700 residents signed a petition
last month saying Dad's Coffee Shop ``or any other enterprise of
this obscene nature'' should go.
   Frank Siderowicz, who headed the petition drive, said
``trashy-type people'' frequented the coffee shop off Main Street
in the borough just north of Scranton.
   ``This is a small-town atmosphere. We don't need this kind of
clientele coming up to Dickson City,'' he said.
   Thomas Wasley Jr. said he opened Dad's Coffee Shop on Feb. 15 to
provide a bar-like atmosphere without alcohol to people
18-and-older.
   ``I see myself as a trendsetter,'' Wasley said. ``You're not
going to get smashed drinking coffee. It's an idea whose time has
come.''
   But the borough has started legal action against Wasley, saying
he violates the local zoning laws by providing entertainment
without a special permit.
   ``He advertises the waitresses, not the coffee,'' said John
Maholick, borough council president. ``Where else do you pay $2 for
a cup of coffee in a styrofoam cup, no refills?''
   Wasley was given a cease and desist order April 19 citing the
alleged zoning violation and a hearing has been set for May 25. He
could be fined up to $500 a day.
   Anthony P. Daniel, Lasley's attorney, said topless waitresses
weren't providing entertainment at the coffee shop, which is open
from 6 a.m. to midnight and serves food from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m.
   ``There's no dancing. There's no singing. ... They're simply
waitresses,'' he said.
   Daniel added that Dad's Coffee Shop is located in an area zoned
``highway commercial,'' which he said allows entertainment.
   At lunchtime on a recent weekday a dozen customers _ 11 of them
men _ sat in chairs on both sides of the narrow wood counter in
Dad's Coffee Shop, a dark room set between a pizza parlor and a
Chinese restaurant.
   A waitress who gave her name only as Kim served customers
coffee, or simply sat on the counter and talked with them.
   Wasley said the outfits _ or lack of them _ drew the customers,
but the service kept them coming back.
   ``What I'm providing is excellent, excellent service: very
friendly girls who will go over to a stranger and talk to them and
make them feel like they belong,'' he said.
   Dwayne Allison, 28, from nearby Clifford, said Dad's Coffee Shop
was an alternative to bars.
   ``For people who choose not to drink, it's kind of like the bar
without the booze,'' said Allison, ordering a black coffee and a
$1.25 hamburger.
   Wasley, 45, thought of the topless coffee shop after selling a
go-go lounge he owned in nearby Mayfield last December.

<TEXT>
   Tree Top, the nation's largest apple
processer, says it will break contracts with apple growers who use
the chemical Alar on this season's crops.
   The growers' cooperative in Idaho, Oregon and Washington said
Thursday the move was to allay consumer fears over reports that
Alar can cause cancer.
   In the past, Tree Top rejected apples that were treated with the
chemical, which makes apples redder and crisper.
   Under the expanded ban, no apples will be accepted from any
growers who uses Alar on any of their apple trees, even if the
specific apples submitted to Tree Top aren't treated with the
chemical.
   ``Tree Top is trying to step up the pressure to eliminate Alar
from the apple industry altogether,'' said Mark Murray, a spokesman
for the Selah-based growers' cooperative.
   Tree Top previously urged the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency to ban Alar use altogether, and it has requested the
chemical's manufacturer, Uniroyal, to stop its production.
   The chemical is legal to use but it has become highly
controversial since the Natural Resources Defense Council reported
earlier this year that the chemical leads to cancer in children.
   The report was challenged by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration and other federal health officials, who said the
Alar present in some apples was not enough to endanger humans.

   Growers are worried that there's too much
sunshine visible through the Sunshine State's famed orange juice
these days.
   Although Florida's juice tastes as sweet as ever, it's gradually
becoming paler, according to many of Florida's 12,000 growers and
more than 30 citrus processors.
   ``This industry is running into real trouble,'' said David O.
Hamrick, a veteran citrus grower and processor from Bradenton.
``The color issue is something we need to consider.''
   Consumers apparently prefer darker orange juice and industry
insiders fear today's Florida orange juice _ which often is more
yellow than orange _ could affect the state's $4 billion a year
industry.
   ``Color perception is very important to consumers, but it's only
a perception,'' said Hamrick, who retired last year as senior vice
president of Tropicana Products Inc., and has served 16 years on
the Florida Citrus Commission.
   The truth is, dark juice can be less tasty, depending on the
variety, Hamrick said.
   ``The problem is already acute,'' warned John Attaway, director
of scientific research for the state Department of Citrus in
Lakeland.
   Part of the problem has been the weather. Devastating freezes in
1983 and 1985 destroyed about 200,000 of Florida's more than
847,000 acres of fruit trees.
   Today the state has about 700,000 acres and in recent years
growers have been planting at the rate of more than 50,000 acres a
year.
   But growers seeking to harvest their fruit before the January
and February freezes are planting oranges that mature early.
   The main early-season juice-fruit, the Hamlin orange, ripens as
early as October and produces a sweet juice.
   Unfortunately, juice from Hamlin oranges is far lighter in color
than the late-season Valencia orange, which matures from March
through June.
   Processors seeking a product of uniform color often blend
early-and late-season fruit, and the color of a lot of Florida
orange juice is fading as an ever-higher percentage of Hamlins
moves into the mixing vats.
   The juice could become still paler in coming decades as newly
planted Hamlin trees reach their production peak.

<TEXT>
   Police today filed charges ranging
from murder to obstruction of official duty against 76 radical
students arrested in connection with the burning deaths of six
police officers.
   Police in the southern port of Pusan charged four student
leaders with arson and murder. The charges carry a maximum sentence
of death.
   Lesser charges of violent acts or obstruction of official duty
were filed against the other students.
   Police also said they were looking for 16 more students in the
case.
   Six riot troopers were killed and 11 others injured on Wednesday
when they tried to free five police officers held hostage by
radical students at Dongui University in Pusan.
   Authorities said the troopers became entrapped in flames when
students poured paint thinner in a corridor and set it ablaze to
stop the raid.
   Student leaders in Pusan and other parts of the country
expressed condolences for the dead officers. They described the
troopers as victims of President Roh Tae-woo's ``undemocratic
system'' and said they will not end their campaign to topple the
government.
   Students said they will wear mourning ribbons until the officers
are buried Sunday in a funeral ceremony.
   Following the deaths the governing and opposition parties agreed
to enact a law that would ban firebombs, a weapon commonly used by
dissidents and radical students in anti-government protests.
   A draft law calls for up to seven years' imprisonment for people
who use firebombs. Those who manufacture or carry firebombs could
be sentenced to up to three years in prison or fined up to $4,600.

   The verdict in Oliver North's trial is not
likely to end revelations still trickling out from the Iran-Contra
affair, says one of the chief congressional investigators.
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, who was chairman of the House committee that
delved into the affair in 1987, noted that more trials are yet to
come, and that the House and Senate Intelligence committees are
looking into why some key documents that came out at North's trial
were never turned over to congressional investigators.
   ``We certainly didn't find out all the truth in the Iran-Contra
hearings,'' said Hamilton, D-Ind. ``We'll be learning bits and
pieces about Iran-Contra for years to come, and after the statute
of limitations runs out we'll probably find more.''
   ``The North trial raised a number of questions that I think are
still unanswered,'' Hamilton said this morning on NBC-TV's
``Today'' show.
   ``We still have many, many unanswered questions about
Iran-Contra and those should be pursued. And certainly important
documents that came out in the North trial, we should understand
why we did not get those documents,'' he added.
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said on ABC's ``Good Morning America,''
meantime, ``I think what you'll find when the investigation is
complete ... no documents were withheld. if there were, it was
inadvertant. there was certainly no conspiracy ....''
   The House Intelligence Committee moved Thursday to begin a staff
investigation into what key documents failed to reach Congress and
why those papers were not turned over by the White House. The
panel's Senate counterpart already had begun such a probe.
   ``The documents are important and clearly were within the scope
of the investigation,'' Hamilton said. ``It is up to us to pursue
the implications of those documents to their conclusion.''
   Documents introduced in North's trial indicated that
then-President Reagan approved a deal in 1985 in which the United
States would expedite economic and military aid to Honduras in
return for that country's continued help for the Contras, who were
encamped just inside Honduras along the border with Nicaragua.
Official U.S. aid to the Contras was banned at the time.
   The documents, together with trial testimony, suggested that
senior officials up to and including former President Reagan and
then-Vice President George Bush were more involved in the affair
than the congressional committees knew.
   Bush himself spoke out for the first time on the subject
Thursday, giving reporters ``the word of the president of the
United States'' that ``there was no quid pro quo.'' He said he
would turn over to Congress records of his 1985 meeting with the
Honduran president.
   One main document introduced at the trial, a 42-page admission
of facts stipulated by the government, said that Reagan did approve
a deal and that expedited aid did begin flowing to Honduras.
   Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., chairman of the Appropriations
subcommittee that handles foreign aid, said he would hold up all
aid to Central America until the contradictions are cleared up.
   ``I simply feel we have an obligation to find out what the facts
were,'' Obey said. ``The sad truth is that Congress apparently has
been lied to for years.''
   The White House has offered to make available to Congress former
White House counsel Arthur B. Culvahouse Jr., who oversaw the
document search for the congressional Iran-Contra committees and
gave assurances that all relevant documents had been provided.
   Senate investigators already have identified at least six
documents made public during North's trial which failed to come to
light during the 1987 congressional probe. Most of them point to a
deal with Honduras to expedite U.S. aid in return for help for the
Contras.
   Among them are a Feb. 19, 1985, memo outlining such a plan and
approved by Reagan, and a memo dated the following day making it
clear that the administration knew it was forbidden to provide aid
under those circumstances.

<HEAD>Border Patrol Cuts Back Extra Agents As Number of Central Americans
Plummets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOEL WILLIAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>McALLEN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sharp drop in the number of Central
Americans trying to enter the United States has prompted the Border
Patrol to scale back extra forces detailed to the south Texas
border, an official said.
   Immigration officials say the drop in apprehensions means
get-tough policies are discouraging Central Americans from coming
here to file frivolous applications for political asylum.
   Central American apprehensions in south Texas have fallen from
200-250 a day in early March to a current level of 50-60 a day,
E.J. Vickery, assistant chief of the Border Patrol's McAllen
Sector, said Thursday.
   From January to March, the Border Patrol's McAllen Sector added
192 extra agents to stem a flood of other-than-Mexican aliens
entering the country illegally. The bulk of the extra agents
brought in from other parts of the country patrolled in the
Brownsville area, the closest border crossing point to Nicaragua,
El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala.
   The agency began detaining nearly all of those apprehended,
rather than releasing most on their own recognizance, as it had
been doing.
   The crackdown accompanied an Immigration and Naturalization
Service policy that began Feb. 21, in which asylum applicants are
processed in one day and immediately detained if their initial
claims to refugee status are denied.
   The number of extra Border Patrol agents in South Texas has been
cut to 102, and may be reduced further if apprehensions continue to
drop, said Vickery. There are 395 agents permanently stationed in
the McAllen Sector.
   He said the word of a crackdown has reached Central America.
   ``If you're caught here you are detained, then your case is
heard immediately,'' he said. ``It's not like it was before when
they were released and traveled north never to be heard from
again.''
   INS officials also say the number of people turning themselves
in voluntarily to apply for political asylum has plummeted from 500
a day in January to a current level of fewer than 10 daily in South
Texas.
   ``In fact, on Tuesday of this week, we didn't have any
applicants,'' said Virginia Kice, spokeswoman for the INS'
Harlingen District.

<TEXT>
   A plumber's proposal to turn a
southwest Oregon county into an AIDS Free Zone has gotten a cold
reception from authorities.
   ``This is an invasion of the rights of citizens,'' Josephine
County Commissioner Rebecca Brown said. ``It also reminds me of
Nazi Germany. This is much more frightening than any threat of the
AIDS virus.''
   She was reacting to a ballot measure proposed Wednesday by
George Heimos that would amend the county charter to require mass
testing for the AIDS virus and possible expulsion for those who
test positive.
   ``I decided that this county has a high Christian value to it
and that AIDS would certainly wipe out a huge portion of the
population should it start to spread very rapidly,'' the Grants
Pass resident said.
   He must gather 1,824 signatures to put the measure on the
ballot. The earliest election date available would be in May 1990.
   Heimos wants to administer widespread tests and publish the
results.
   Those to be tested under the proposal include children in public
schools, public employees, many jail inmates, applicants for county
permits or licences, people known to have had extra-marital affairs
and those who engage in high-risk behavior.
   The proposal calls for the county Health Department to
quarantine those carrying the virus or expel them from the county.

   Vice President Dan Quayle toured
sludge-fouled beaches on his return from a 12-day Pacific tour, and
said today Exxon must do more to clean up the devastation wrought
by the nation's largest oil spill.
   ``It's going to be an enormous effort,'' Quayle said Thursday as
he looked at a beach on hard-hit Smith Island, an important haulout
area for seals. Workers have been laboring for days to wash the
beach clean.
   Then at a news conference early today, Quayle said it appears
Exxon believes its cleanup plan is adequate, ``But I believe
Exxon's going to have to do more than they think they're going to
have to do,'' he said.
   Quayle, accompanied by his wife, Marilyn, and joined by Coast
Guard Commandant Paul A. Yost Jr. and federal Transportation
Secretary Samuel Skinner, ended his Pacific trip Thursday with a
six-hour, wind- and rain-swept tour of the spill zone.
   The vice president's jet arrived from Japan at the fishing town
of Cordova, about 50 miles from the site of the March 24 spill,
which was caused when the tanker Exxon Valdez slammed into a
charted reef outside shipping lanes and poured 10.1 million gallons
of crude through its shattered hull.
   Oil from the slick has been spotted more than 520 miles
southwest of Valdez past the tiny village of Chignik on the Alaskan
Peninsula. State environmental officials said Thursday the oil is
moving in some areas at the rate of 17{ miles a day.
   The ship's skipper, Joseph Hazelwood, has pleaded innocent to
operating the vessel while drunk and is being investigated by a
grand jury for potential felony charges. His trial is set to begin
June 20 in Valdez.
   Before the news conference, Quayle, dressed in jeans and a
flight jacket, met with Democratic Gov. Steve Cowper and more than
a dozen mayors and leaders representing areas affected by the spill.
   Quayle told reporters that although President Bush has not
personally visited the spill site, he has expressed his concern by
sending top federal officials to Alaska.
   Quayle earlier met with two dozen local officials at Cordova,
who urged him to support the expansion of a local salmon research
facility to study the effects of the spill. ``You can count on
it,'' Quayle told one resident.
   He also agreed to serve Alaskan salmon at the White House.
   Traveling in helicopters, Quayle and his entourage then went to
the USS Juneau, the Coast Guard's command center for the cleanup,
and to Smith Island.
   Oil from the spill has spread to the spectacular Katmai National
Park, a wildlife refuge. Exxon officials Thursday proposed arming
the guards of their workcrews with shotguns to protect them against
the bears. Currently, guards are carrying chemical sprays to fend
off animals.
   But state and federal environmental officials were concerned
that inexperienced guards might shoot the bears needlessly.
   Exxon, which is financing the cleanup, has offered a plan to
clean 364 miles of Alaska coastline by mid-September. But nearly
200 of those miles would be left untouched by cleanup crews and
allowed to be cleansed by natural wave, wind and rain action.
   The company also says it may require exemptions from Alaska's
strict environmental laws to dispose of the waste it collects,
either through burning, burying or waste-water treatment.
   The state, responding to a request from Yost to evaluate Exxon's
revised cleanup plan, was sharply critical of the proposal, saying
it was inadequate and didn't provide for enough personnel to do the
job.
   Exxon President Lee R. Raymond, at a news conference in his New
York City offices, denied the company was trying to cut corners in
the cleanup. But he complained that as many as 14 government
agencies may be involved in approving and carrying out the final
plan.
   ``I want one person in charge _ I don't care who it is _ because
there has to be one person that finally says, `Hey, it's midnight
and we've got to do something,'' Raymond said. ``Anything
reasonable, anything that makes sense that they would say you ought
to do in addition to what you have in the plan, we'll do it.''

<HEAD>Search Continues for 22 Taiwanese Fishermen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Searchers looking for 22 crewmen of a Taiwanese
fishing vessel that sank 1,150 miles northwest of Midway Island
have had to contend with 10-foot seas and 40- to 50-knot winds, the
Coast Guard said.
   A piece of a life raft believed to be from the Hun-Kuoa No. 2
was all that was found before darkness set in Thursday night, Coast
Guard spokesman David Goff said.
   The vessel sank Wednesday after colliding with a sister ship,
the Hun-Kuoa No. 1, which helped in the search along with three
other Taiwanese fishing vessels and two commercial vessels, Goff
said.
   The ships continued to search through the night, and were to be
joined today by a Coast Guard C130 search and rescue plane from
Honolulu and a Navy P-3 Orion patrol plane from Adak, Alaska, he
said.
   Rescue operations were being coordinated by the Coast Guard
cutter Jarvis, which was diverted from fishing patrol in the North
Pacific, Goff said.
   The crew of the sinking ship were seen jumping into the water in
lifejackets, but the Hun-Kuoa No. 1 was unable to pick them up
because it had temporarily lost power, Goff said.

   A 3-year-old child has died of injuries he
suffered when he was mauled by a pit bull terrier owned by his
grandparents, authorities said.
   Dustin Webb, son of Steve and Debbie Webb, died Thursday at John
Sealy Hospital in nearby Galveston, a day after he was attacked by
the dog as he played in the backyard of his grandparents' home,
officials said.
   Clute Police Chief Mark Wicker said the boy was playing in the
yard while his grandmother, Geraldine Webb, was in the house.
   The child was pulled from the dog's jaws only after his
grandmother and a neighbor fought off the dog, Wicker said.
   Authorities were holding the dog, but have not decided what to
do with the animal, Wicker said.
   The fatal attack was at least the third by pit bulls in the
Houston area in the past five years, authorities said.

   Calls for a presidential pardon in the wake of
three guilty verdicts against former Marine Lt. Col. Oliver L.
North are producing disagreement in Congress, but most of those
commenting concur that North should spend little or no time in jail.
   Many conservatives called for a prompt pardon by President Bush.
Other members of Congress _ including some conservatives _ said
that would be premature at best and that the judicial process
should be allowed to run its course.
   Former President Gerald R. Ford, whose pardon of ex-President
Richard Nixon caused a furor and may have cost Ford re-election,
declined to give Bush advice on the subject.
   ``I have very strictly taken the position that it would be
inappropriate for me to comment on that publicly. ... It's a very
very personal (decision) to the presidnet, as I found out from my
own experience,'' said Ford on ABC's Good Morning America.
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., chairman of the House investigating
committee, said on ``Today'' this morning that ``this is not an
instance where a presidential pardon is appropriate, nor is it an
instance where he should have extended sentence....''
   Hamilton said earlier that the ``fact that Col. North was in a
difficult position does not absolve him of his responsibility, but
it may go toward mitigation of his punishment.''
   Opinions varied widely on the federal jury's split decision _
convicting North on three charges, acquitting him on nine others _
and on the ultimate meaning of his role at the heart of the mystery
known as the Iran-Contra affair.
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., said on CBS ``This Morning'' that
while he opposes a pardon, the commutation of a prison sentence
would be ``totally appropriate.''
   ``I don't think there should be a prison sentence. I don't think
there ought to be any kind of a harsh sentence at all. I do think
it is important to establish for the future that there's no
ambiguity, that no matter what you think other people may have
ordered, you simply can't rip up documents and you can't mislead
the Congress as long as national security wasn't involved,'' said
Frank.
   ``I think he's a very tragic figure,'' said Sen. Warren Rudman,
R-N.H., vice chairman of the Senate Iran-Contra Committee. ``But I
find no evidence of remorse on his part because he really believes
he was doing what he was supposed to do.
   ``I do not think Oliver North understands to this day what the
constitutional issues were all about,'' Rudman said.
   Daniel L. Casey, president of the American Conservative Union,
called on Bush to pardon North and Richard A. Viguerie, chairman of
the United Conservative Union, declared that ``Oliver North
deserves a medal, not a prison sentence.''
   ``I predict there will be an avalanche of conservative outcry
for President Bush to pardon Ollie,'' Viguerie said.
   ``I think George Bush should pardon him,'' said Sen. Orrin
Hatch, R-Utah, who was one of North's stoutest defenders in the
Iran-Contra probe.
   But Hatch and other senators said that step would almost
certainly cause political problems for Bush, similar to those faced
by Ford when he pardoned Nixon in the Watergate scandal.
   ``The president's problem is that if he does pardon him there
will be shouting and screaming from the same partisans who have
been out to hang North from the beginning,'' Hatch said.
   Some of Hatch's conservative colleagues disagreed on the pardon
issue.
   ``I do not want to see a pardon because I think the court system
is working very well,'' said Sen. Larry Pressler, R-S.D.
   Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., also opposed a pardon saying,
``The man was indicted and the jury decided that the facts upheld
three of the indictments. It's obviously a tragedy for him and his
family. But no one is above the law.''
   ``As a former prosecutor I wasn't surprised at the verdict,''
said Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt. ``What the jury is saying very
clearly is that North shouldn't be taking the blame for the whole
thing, he shouldn't be a fall guy.''
   But Leahy said a presidential pardon would ``make a mockery of
the whole system.''
   Sen. Joseph R. Biden, D-Del., chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, said a pardon would be ``outrageous.''
   ``I take the president at his word that there will be no
pardon,'' Biden said and added: ``It seems to me the jury came to
the conclusion that you cannot lie and that you are not allowed to
go ahead and shred documents, that you are responsible for your
actions, that you still have to obey the law even though someone
else told you to do it.''
   Former President Reagan, on whose watch North took the actions
that resulted in the Iran-Contra scandal and his trial by jury,
declined to comment because North still faces a long process of
court hearings and appeals.
   But Sen. Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii, the chairman of the Senate
Iran-Contra Committee, said the decision reaffirms the panel's
findings that North and the others involved in the Iran-Contra
affair ``showed disdain for our laws and constitutional system of
government.''
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who also served on the Iran-Contra
committee, said he felt ``Colonel North was left twisting in the
wind by an administration he served with all his heart and soul.''

   Spurred by a surge in Asian tourism, San
Francisco International Airport planners are considering a
six-year, $1 billion plan to expand the facility.
   The proposal would include the construction of an international
terminal costing $250 million to $300 million, according to the
airport's preliminary master plan, released Thursday.
   But before the ambitious project can get off the ground, airport
officials will have to contend with critics worried about jet
noise, traffic and air safety.
   A surge in Asian tourism has caused airlines to add flights to
handle an increase in travelers from the Far East, where economic
good times are expected to continue.
   San Francisco International served 30 million passengers last
year. By 1996, that number is expected to rise to 42 million
passengers, according to airport planners.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of destitute women struggled
to get 500 free saris being distributed in Chandpur today,
triggering a stampede that killed at least 19 women and injured 70,
United News of Bangladesh reported.
   A wealthy merchant in Chandpur, 40 miles east of Dhaka, wanted
to hand out the saris to celebrate the Eid al-Fitr feast marking
the end of the holy Islamic month of Ramadan, the news agency said.
   But the sari distribution was halted after the stampede. Most of
the brightly colored lengths of cloth intended for the poor lay
scattered and bloodstained on the ground, the news agency said.
   More than 2,000 women, many of them dressed only in rags,
gathered outside merchant Fazlur Rahman's house before dawn, the
agency said. By the time a guard opened the gate at 8 a.m., the
crowd had swollen to more than 3,000.
   Some of the women surged through a small portico and swarmed up
the narrow stairs. In an effort to halt the onrush, the guard
closed the iron gate but the stampede grew worse, the news agency
said.
   Distribution of gifts is an Islamic tradition at the end of
Ramadan, the month of dawn-to-dusk fasting. The custom, called
``zakat,'' requires the rich to give the poor a portion of their
earnings in the past year.

<HEAD>Oral Roberts Will Ask Creditors for Extension to Save Ministry</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Evangelist Oral Roberts, who said in March
he needed $11 million by Saturday to save his ministry, will ask
creditors for more time if the $4 million still needed isn't raised
this weekend, ministry officials said.
   Mark Swadener, chief financial officer for the ministry, said
officials will meet Monday to determine whether the fund-raising
goal was met and if they need to request more time from vendors.
   Roberts said in late March that he must raise $11 million by May
6 or creditors will begin ``dismantling'' Oral Roberts University
and City of Faith hospital. The university also would be unable to
meet the payroll for its 2,130 employees, he said.
   ``Based upon where we have been, it looks like we will have to
talk to the vendors about an extension,'' Swadener said Thursday.
   Roberts, 71, said monthly contributions to his ministry have
been cut nearly in half, dropping from $5 million to $2.7 million,
and blamed ``a spirit of skepticism'' after scandals in the
ministries of evangelists Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart.
   He said his ministry was in ``a life-or-death struggle'' to pay
the six months of past-due bills.
   Roberts announced Tuesday that the university's athletic
programs were dropping out of NCAA competition immediately to save
an estimated $500,000 to $1 million a year.
   The ministry also said Wednesday it was canceling a contract to
broadcast Richard Roberts' daily show on KOTV in Tulsa in hopes of
saving $100,000 through the end of the year. Richard Roberts is
Oral Roberts' son.
   The university will hold commencement excercises Saturday for
nearly 1,000 of its 4,300 students.

<TEXT>
   Warsaw Pact nations today pressured
quarreling NATO allies to open talks on reducing tactical nuclear
weapons in Europe and said such negotiations are tied to efforts to
trim conventional forces.
   Soviet and East German diplomats used today's resumption of
East-West talks on conventional weapons to jump into the dispute
within the NATO alliance over reducing short-range nuclear weapons.
   West Germany and some European NATO members want superpower
talks on reducing short-range nuclear weapons, but the United
States and Britain oppose them because of the Soviet advantage in
conventional weapons. Washington and London also want to modernize
the short-range missiles.
   East German Ambassador Klaus-Dieter Ernst insisted at today's
resumption of conventional arms talks that parallel talks on
reducing short-range nuclear weapons are vital to Germans.
   ``The shorter the range of the rockets, the more dead Germans,''
he told a news conference, referring to the fact that East and West
Germans are most threatened by the short-range weapons.
   The absence of parallel negotations on nuclear weapons ``would
of course have negative effects'' on the Vienna talks on
conventional arms, he added.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, worried about the sliding
popularity of his center-right government, supports talks with the
Soviets on reducing short-range nuclear weapons and wants to
postpone a decision on modernizing the weapons until after next
year's elections.
   The Vienna talks opened March 9 with a mandate that specifically
excluded nuclear rockets.
   But Ernst and Soviet Ambassador Oleg A. Grinevsky said that the
seven Warsaw Pact nations see talks on short-range nuclear weapons
and naval forces as part of overall efforts to reduce arms and
increase security in Europe.
   U.S. Ambassador Steven J. Ledogar said he was disappointed when
every East bloc speaker at today's closed-door talks mentioned the
nuclear weapons, ``even as they admitted they have no place in this
negotiation.''
   ``I suspect that they know that there's a certain amount of
discussion in the NATO camp,'' he told reporters, referring to the
internal NATO rift.
   Ledogar stressed that NATO squabbles over nuclear weapons will
have no effect on NATO unity at the Vienna talks. ``We are in
complete unison,'' he said.
   Grinevsky used today's session to outline a plan dividing the
zone covered by the talks _ from the Atlantic to the Ural mountains
deep inside the Soviet Union _ into smaller regions.
   He said the two sides should work to agree on overall totals for
the number of men and weapons each military bloc can possess, but
also agree on totals for each region.
   The regions included a central European zone comprising West
Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and Denmark on the
NATO side, and Poland, East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Hungary for
the Warsaw Pact. It is in this area that most of the deadly
weaponry of both military blocs is massed.
   But Grinevsky failed to provide any overall weapons ceilings or
for the zones. Ledogar said such totals were vital for progress at
the talks.
   At the previous round of talks that ended March 22, the Warsaw
Pact outlined plans for reducing troops and weapons 10 percent to
15 percent below present levels by 1994, a further 25 percent by
1997 and moving to completely defensive forces by the year 2000.
   NATO, by contrast, presented a more specific proposal for
ceilings on tanks, artillery and armored personnel carriers.
   Both sides declared their willingness to get down to specifics
today, but remained divided over which weapons categories they want
to cut first.
   NATO estimates that the Warsaw Pact will have more than a 2-to-1
edge in tanks and artillery in Europe even after recently announced
unilateral troop cuts are carried out in the Soviet bloc.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev announced in December that
50,000 Soviet troops and 5,000 tanks would pull out of East
Germany, Hungary and Czechoslovakia by 1991. The withdrawals began
last week in Hungary with the departure of 31 T-64 tanks.
   Ernst said today that further unilateral cuts by the various
Warsaw Pact allies mean that, by 1991, the Soviet bloc will cut its
troops by 581,300 men, 12,751 tanks, 10,030 artillery systems,
1,010 combat aircraft, 895 armored vehicles and 30 ``nuclear
systems.''

   Government should allow certain levels of
toxic pollution in the air and drop the current goal of a total
ban, says a draft developed by officials working on President
Bush's clean air package.
   ``The zero tolerance level mandated under current law is
suboptimal and if continued would be extremely costly, politically
difficult and would threaten the shutdown of many plants in several
industries from court mandates,'' says the document, a copy of
which was obtained Thursday.
   The draft document provides options for pollution control
ranging from assessing health risks against industry costs, to
setting standards for 125 pollution categories to leaving the whole
matter up to the states.
   The draft's options on airborne toxins are to be reviewed by
Bush's Domestic Policy Council before going to the president with a
recommendation as part of his Clean Air Act revision plan. The plan
also will include sections on acid rain and attainment of urban
ozone standards.
   Some environmental activists who obtained the document denounced
its proposals as too weak to protect the public against airborne
poisons.
   The draft deals with the attempt to arrest the 2.7 billion
pounds of poisonous chemicals that the EPA estimates are released
into the atmosphere each year.
   The EPA is now required to assess the risk of each chemical, and
then develop a chemical-by-chemical emissions standard designed to
``protect the public health within an ample margin of safety.''
   Analysts from the environmentalist Natural Resources Defense
Council on Thursday attacked the draft proposals as a weak effort.
   ``None of the options are going to protect the public from toxic
air emissions,'' said NRDC resource specialist Debbie Shieman. The
NRDC is a private, non-profit organization.
   She criticized the principles listed in the document, which
stated only that reductions should be achieved ``as soon as
possible,'' and that reduction of health risk be ``balanced against
economic and technical feasibility considerations.''
   Clean air bills are already pending in Congress and more are
expected to be introduced. Bush's plan is expected to be ready
within a month.
   The draft lists three initial regulatory options for industrial
polluters.
   The first would set an ``unreasonable risk standard'' to balance
the benefits of regulation against its cost. This standard, the
document said, ``could be coupled with a commitment to address a
specific list of the industrial sources posing the greatest risk,''
with a period of perhaps three to five years.
   The document acknowledged that such an approach likely ``would
be criticized as not protective of public health.''
   The second option would turn the standards question over to the
states, and have each state issue permits for individual industrial
polluters, specifying acceptable emission levels.
   The third option would list ``about 125 industrial categories
for control on schedules requiring controls by dates 5 to 12 years
after promulgation.''
   This alternative would rely on polluters using ``maximum
available control technology,'' to control emissions.
   Newly constructed pollution sources would have to use the best
achievable technology to cut pollution, but the option said that
must be done ``considering costs and technical feasibility.''
   Existing polluters would use technology defined as the ``maximum
achievable `in common practice' by the `better performing
sources.'''
   It would also allow exemptions for several categories of
polluters.
   That ``common practice'' language, said NRDC clean air
specialist Dick Ayres, is worrisome because ``common practice''
could be read as current procedures that do not necessarily employ
the best technology.
   One administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said it was unclear when the draft would be considered by Bush's
Domestic Policy Council of advisers, which includes Cabinet members
and key officials who advise Bush on domestic matters.
   Airborne toxins are one part of the package, which will also
include smog and acid rain, that the Bush administration is
preparing to propose as a new Clean Air Act.

<HEAD>Shamir: Arab Terrorists Should Not Escape Unscathed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, visiting Jewish
victims of an Arab stabbing attack, said today that Israeli
citizens should make sure terrorists don't escape unscathed.
   Shamir visited a hospital where two survivors were recovering
from Wednesday's attack, in which two elderly Israelis were killed
and three others wounded as they sat at a bus stop in Jerusalem.
Such incidents ``anger us,'' and ``we have to act against this,''
Shamir said.
   He noted that a large contingent of police reinforcements,
believed to number 3,000, have been deployed in Jerusalem to
prevent further attacks during the Eid Al Fitr holiday which marks
the end of the Moslem's monthlong Ramadan fast. But he added that
citizens also had to play a role.
   ``I think the general public and the Jewish public must do their
utmost in order to defend themselves and in order to prevent
murderers from doing their deeds, and in order to prevent them from
coming out unscathed if they succeed in doing something,'' Shamir
said in remarks broadcast on Israel radio.
   Parliament member Haim Oron of the Socialist Mapam Party was
quoted by Israel radio as criticizing Shamir for calling on the
public to take the law into their own hands.
   Shamir's spokesman, Avi Pazner, said the premier meant to say
citizens should help police in guarding against attacks and in
apprehending perpetrators. He said there was no intention to
encourage vigilante actions.
   After Wednesday's attack, Israeli passersby chased, caught and
beat the Arab attacker. Police intervened to rescue the man. Later,
reinforcements were called up to stop reprisal attacks on other
Arabs by angry Israelis.
   Police arrested Rabbi Meir Kahane, leader of the anti-Arab Kach
party, and seven of his followers for disturbing public order.
Kahane's followers had tried to march to the Old Walled City where
they said they would attack Arabs.
   Kahane supporters today staged a protest, demanding his release.
   The Palestinian who carried out Wednesday's attack in Jerusalem
appeared before a judge, who ordered him held for an additional two
weeks.
   The man, 25-year-old Nidal Abdel Razik Zaloum, is from the West
Bank town of El Bireh and told police he acted alone. He had a
bandage on his ear and bloodstains on his shirt. Israel radio said
he asked for a lawyer so that his views would be clearly
represented.
   Police said he had been a member of a fundamentalist
organization, and the Islamic Jihad in Palestine (or Holy War)
group claimed responsibility in a statement issued in Beirut.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip today, Arab reports said five
Palestinians were wounded in clashes with soldiers, four of them in
the Shajayeah neighborhood of Gaza City. Arab reporters said masked
youths left mosques after noon prayers shouting ``God is great,''
and started setting fires and blocking streets.
   At least 460 Palestinians and 20 Israelis have died in the
17-month Palestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   In Jerusalem, about 7,000 Moslems attended prayer services at
the Al Aqsa mosque marking the end of the Ramadan fast.
   Mohammed Al Kafrawi, who delivered a sermon, protested that
Israeli authorities prevented hundreds of thousands from coming to
the mosque.

<HEAD>Woods Hole Scientists Locate Thermal Vents On Floor Of Mediterrean
Sea</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists using a camera-equipped robot that
scours the ocean floor have found the first known thermal vents in
the Mediterranean Sea, and they expect discoveries of exotic
creatures to follow.
   A leader of the undersea project by the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution said Thursday's finding will have broad implications
for marine biology and geology.
   Marine biologists previously have discovered foot-long clams,
12-foot tube worms and other exotic animals living on the floor of
the Atlantic and Pacific oceans near thermal vents, which are deep
cracks where hot minerals well up from the Earth's core.
   The Woods Hole team said it expects that never-before-seen
creatures also will be found near the Mediterranean vents,
discovered about 120 miles from where a remote-controlled
submersible robot will explore a sunken Roman ship in 2,100 feet of
water off the coast of Italy.
   ``Each place where thermal vents have been found before, we've
come across new animals. And each place, they've been different,''
said Shelley Lauzon, a spokeswoman for the oceanographic
institution on Cape Cod.
   The robot, named Jason, will transmit live pictures of the Roman
trading ship and ocean floor to an estimated 250,000 schoolchildren
at 13 museums from British Columbia to Florida.
   Robert Ballard, the oceanographer in charge of the $7 million
Jason project, found the first known undersea vents near the
Galapagos Islands in the eastern Pacific in 1976. Since then,
researchers have found similar vents in the western Pacific and
mid-Atlantic.
   Lauzon said all the vents have been surrounded by chemosynthetic
bacteria, unusual organisms living in darkness and feeding on
chemicals that are toxic to virtually all other forms of life.
   The bacteria, in turn, are believed to start the food chain that
supports exotic animals found nowhere else, including foot-long
clams and mussels in the eastern Pacific, and eyeless shrimp and
hairy snails in the western Pacific.
   The fact that vents have now been found in the Atlantic, the
Pacific and the Mediterranean indicates that they may well be in
all of the world's oceans _ which in turn implies that the
diversity of deep sea life may be far greater than previously
thought, Lauzon said.
   Some scientists also have said that the discovery of
chemosynthetic bacteria and organisms that feed on them makes it
more likely that life could exist on distant planets under extreme
conditions.
   David Gallo, Jason project coordinator and assistant director of
the Center for Marine Exploration at Woods Hole, said how the
discovery of the vents was made was itself a significant
technological advance.
   In the past, such explorations required scientists to spend a
month or more at sea, viewing videotapes of the ocean bottom that
were taken by submersible vessels.
   On Thursday, a satellite hookup enabled scientists at Woods Hole
to see the ocean floor as Jason's camera saw it and to summon
colleagues who could look and offer their opinions, Gallo said.
   ``This is remarkable, that I could get an authority here in two
or three minutes, who didn't have to dedicate a whole month at sea
to participate in this event,'' he said.

<HEAD>Top Soviet Hockey Player Defects, Wants To Play In NHL</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS grafs 7-9 ``It was ...'' with 3 grafs to ADD background

<TEXT>
   Alexander Mogilny, regarded as one of
the best young hockey players in the world, defected to the West to
play in the National Hockey League, according to Soviet and Swedish
news reports.
   Mogilny, 20, failed to show up Thursday at Stockholm's airport
to join the Soviet National Team on its return to Moscow.
   The national news agency, TT, reported that Mogilny left this
morning on a Scandinavian Airlines System plane to New York.
   Spokesmen for the NHL and the Buffalo Sabres, who hold Mogilny's
rights, said they knew nothing of the defection. Sabres spokesman
Budd Bailey said Thursday night that general manager Gerry Meehan
left town Wednesday and did not leave word where he could be
reached.
   But a Gerry Meehan was registered Thursday at the Sergel Plaza
Hotel in Stockholm, where the Soviets won the World Hockey
Championships earlier this week. Meehan could not be immediately
reached for comment.
   Soviet sources indicated in an interview with FLT, a Swedish
news agency, that he was heading to the United States to join an
NHL team.
   Soviet athletes are playing in the West in increasing numbers,
with one of Moligny's former teammates, Sergei Priakin, joining the
Calgary Flames of the NHL in March, and deals in the works to bring
other top hockey players, basketball players and boxers to the
United States.
   It was unclear what effect the defection might have on relations
between the NHL and the Soviets. Four Soviet teams are scheduled to
tour the NHL next season, and the Calgary Flames and Washington
Capitals are to visit the Soviet Union in September.
   ``I can't answer for the Soviets. They have been known in the
past to do things the way they choose,'' Flames general manager
Cliff Fletcher said in Calgary. ``I hope our relationship is
stronger than one hockey player.''
   Fletcher said he did not anticipate any demand for the return of
Priakin.
   ``We have a contract with them for the next two years. I believe
the Soviets have a reputation of being solid businessmen and will
stick to their agreement,'' he said.
   Fletcher described Mogilny as ``the best young player in the
Soviet Union.'' He was voted the world's best junior player by NHL
scouts in a poll organized by The Hockey News.
   Viktor Tikhonov, the coach of the National Team, criticized
Mogilny.
   ``This incident soured our joyful homecoming after winning the
championships,'' Tikhonov told the Soviet news agency Tass. He said
he believed Mogilny was lured by the promise of a big NHL contract.
   However, he described relations between the Soviet Sports
Committee and the NHL as stable.
   Tass said Soviet sports authorities had planned to discuss
allowing other Soviet players to sign with NHL clubs after the team
returned from the world championships.
   In reporting the defection, Soviet television said National Team
officials and the Soviet federation asked the Soviet Embassy to
tell U.S. and Canadian embassies the ``consequences of this
situation for the NHL would be most serious.''
   The owner of the Stockholm hotel where the Soviet team stayed
during the world championships contacted team officials by phone at
the airport and said he had received an anonymous phone call
informing him of the defection.
   Mogilny, a member of the Soviet Central Red Army team, served a
10-game suspension earlier this season after a fight in a Soviet
league game against Spartak Moscow. A Swedish newspaper reported
last week that he also was penalized a month's salary.
   Mogilny, a junior army lieutenant, told the Aftonbladet
newspaper that he was not interested in a military career. ``I want
to do something else with my life,'' the newspaper quoted him as
saying.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II appealed today for
improved relations between Roman Catholics and Moslems in this
southern African nation, which is experiencing a surge in Islamic
fundamentalism.
   ``What is required is mutual respect, as well as mutual
recognition of those things that we share in common,'' the pope
said in a speech to Catholic bishops on the last full day of his
nine-day African tour.
   John Paul repeated the statement he made to Moslems during his
trip to Morocco in 1985, saying that Christians and Moslems ``have
badly understood each other'' and that ``God invites us to change
our old practices.
   ``Both among Christians working for unity ... and among
believers of different religions, there is no place for aggressive
proselytism which disturbs and hurts, still less toward the use of
unworthy methods,'' John Paul said.
   There are about 2.5 million Catholics and 1 million Moslems in
this nation of 8 million people. Anglicans, Protestants and
animists make up most of the rest of the population.
   Since the early 1970s, Moslems have expanded their presence in
Malawi, building hundreds of mosques across the country, widely
believed to have been financed by Saudi dollars.
   Antagonism between Moslems and Catholics arose in 1983 and 1984
when several churches in Blantyre and Mangochi and the cathedral in
Zomba were set on fire by Moslem extremists.
   In August, several Catholic youths and an elderly religious
teacher were forcibly circumcised in a suburb of Blantyre by Moslem
fundamentalists, church officials said.
   Some Moslem leaders said they were upset that the pope was
visiting Malawi during the period of Ramadan.
   Vatican officials say the spread of Islam is one of the church's
main challenges in Africa.
   ``A big question is whether Africa will be a Christian or Moslem
continent 25 years from now,'' Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro
said today. ``The church cannot compete with the billions of
dollars that is financing Islam in Africa.''
   Earlier today, the pope celebrated Mass for more than 100,000
people gathered on the sloping meadow of Blantyre's Kwacha Park.
   In his homily, the pope referred to AIDS for the second day in a
row, urging his flock to treat the victims of the disease as ``we
would treat Christ himself.''
   According to health officials here, as many as 18 percent of
newborn children are infected with the AIDS virus. Navarro said
about 20 percent of prisoners and urban workers have the disease.
   The pope also referred to the 640,000 refugees who have fled to
Malawi to escape a civil war in neighboring Mozambique, urging his
audience to ``show love and kindness'' toward them.
   The ceremony was attended by Malawi's president-for-life,
Hastings Kamuzu Banda, who arrived in a Mercedes limousine
surrounded by his troupe of women dancers and singers and sat on a
stage decorated with two carved wooden lions.
   The pope came to Malawi after visits to Madagascar, Reunion and
Zambia and returns to Rome on Saturday night.

<HEAD>Scientists Develop Treatment For Longer-Lived Tomatoes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SYRACUSE,, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The study of an obscure wild Brazilian
tomato has led scientists to the discovery of a treatment that
doubles the keeping time of some commercially-grown tomatoes.
   The nation's $1 billion fresh-tomato industry could realize
dramatic benefits from the new process, said Peter J. Davies, a
plant physiology professor at Cornell University.
   ``It gives shippers more time to get the fruit to market, it
gives supermarkets a longer period of time to sell the fruit and it
will provide consumers with a better-tasting tomato, particularly
during the off-season,'' said Davies, the project director.
   The Cornell treatment process increases the shelf-life of
vine-ripened tomatoes to 10 to 12 days, said David M. Law, a
research associate on the project. Currently, store-bought tomatoes
begin spoiling after 4 to 5 days.
   The method involves increasing the level of a chemical compound,
called 1,4 butanediamine, already found naturally in the tomato.
The process is now being tested by a food company to determine
whether it is viable on a large scale.
   ``We were studying a mutant tomato, looking for a compound to
induce ripening, when we kind of came upon this,'' said Law.
   Researchers got the idea while studying the Alcobaca tomato, a
non-edible variety that holds its ripeness for several weeks before
spoiling. Cornell plant scientist Martha Mutschler found that once
the tomato is picked, the ripening process slows drastically, said
Davies.
   Scientists eventually learned that the delay in the Alcobaca's
ripening process was caused by an abundance of 1,4 butanediamine,
one of a group of chemicals known as polyamines found in all living
things. They also found several other natural polyamines that
worked to retard ripening.
   The Cornell method calls for picking the fruit just after it
begins to ripen on the vine and then infusing it with the
polyamines.
   ``We simply double the level of polyamines already in the fruit,
thus preventing the ripe fruit from becoming soft too quickly,''
said Davies.
   Most tomatoes available in stores during the off-season are
picked while still green and are ripened with treatments of
ethylene, a naturally occurring hormone, Davies said.
   ``Green tomatoes never ripen properly and they never seem to
taste like vine-ripened ones,'' said Davies.

<HEAD>Increase in U.S. Cases Pushes AIDS Worldwide Total Above 150,000</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   New figures from the United States pushed the
total of reported cases of AIDS around the world to more than
150,000 last month, the World Health Organisation said today.
   Updated reports received during April listed 5,191 new cases,
nearly half of which were registered by the United States,
according to the U.N. agency's latest monthly survey.
   A total of 151,790 cases have now been registered since WHO
started keeping records in 1980. Twenty-eight of the 148 reporting
countries say they have no victims. American Samoa, in the Western
Pacific, reported its first case.
   The United States, which accounts for nearly 60 percent of the
world's total, reported 2,845 new victims between the end of
February and mid-April. This brought the U.S. total up to 89,501
cases.
   France, which ranks second only to the United States in the
number of reported cases, found 754 new sufferers in the first
three months of the year, raising its total to 6,409 cases.
   Brazil registered 766 new cases for the first two months of
1989. With a reported total of 5,712 cases, the country has the
highest number of cases in Latin America.
   Bermuda had the highest incidence rate in the American region,
with 49.1 per 100,000 people, compared with 10.5 in the United
States.
   In Africa, Malawi had the highest rate, 22.2. In Europe,
Switzerland, topped the rate list with 5.9 per 100,000.
   Except for Australia, 2.8, and French Polynesia, 3.3, the number
of reported cases in the remainining regions of the world was too
low for computing an incidence rate.

<HEAD>Former President Carter Says Bush Is Off To Good Start</HEAD>
<HEAD>By DARREN DOPP</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush is off to a surprisingly good
start as president, according to an unlikely supporter _ Jimmy
Carter.
   ``Bush has done a fine job so far,'' the former president said
Thursday. ``My only concern is that his administration respond more
vigorously to the chance to negotiate with the Soviets on further
arms control.''
   Carter, participating in the state University of Buffalo's
``Power and the Presidency'' lecture series, told the audience of
about 4,000 that every president must be ``competent, compassionate
and always tell the truth'' and that Bush seems to exhibit more of
these qualities than his predecessor, President Reagan.
   Carter expressed similar sentiments at a meeting earlier
Thursday in Atlanta with contributors to Cable News Network's
``World Report.''
   Carter said Bush has done an extraordinarily good job in several
areas, including Central America, the administration's plan for
reducing the debt of foreign nations and its relations with the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   In a meeting with reporters in Buffalo before his talk, Carter
said it was clear that Oliver North was not acting alone when he
misled Congress on the Reagan administration's involvement in the
Iran-Contra scandal.
   ``I don't think there's any doubt about the fact President
Reagan knew what was going on and gave either direct or indirect
approval,'' he said.
   North was convicted Thursday on three of the 12 charges stemming
from the scandal, including one that he destroyed documents as part
of a cover-up.
   Carter said he didn't think the verdict would have a significant
effect on the Bush administration.
   On another topic, Carter said he was glad that Bush was moving
away from the Reagan administration policy of avoiding discussion
of American hostages in Lebanon.
   ``Ignoring them doesn't work,'' he said.
   Carter revealed that he once called Robert MacFarlane, Reagan's
national security advisor, and threatened to publicly denounce the
administration if it did not resume private briefings for the

   Iranian Parliament Speaker Hashemi
Rafsanjani said today that Palestinians should kill Americans and
other Westerners in retaliation for attacks by the Israeli military
in the occupied territories.
   ``If in retaliation for every Palestinian martyred in Palestine
they will kill and execute, not inside Palestine, five Americans or
Britons or Frenchmen, they (Israelis) could not continue these
wrongs,'' Rafsanjani was quoted as saying by the official Islamic
Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia.
   ``It is not hard to kill Americans or Frenchman. It is a bit
difficult to kill (Israelis). But there are so many (Americans and
Frenchman) everywhere in the world,'' he said.
   At least 460 Palestinians and 20 Israelis have died in the
17-month-old Palestinian uprising against Israeli in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip, which Israel seized from Jordan and Egypt in the
1967 Middle East war.
   IRNA said Rafsanjani spoke at a prayer sermon today in Tehran
before huge rallies to mark the Iranian holiday in support of the
Palestinian cause.
   Television showed pictures of thousands of demonstrators.
Excerpts of the speech also were carried by Tehran Radio.
   ``God knows there is a solution if you announce today that from
now on you will threaten American interests throughout the world,''
Rafsanjani said.
   IRNA said Rafsanjani also encouraged Palestinians to hijack
planes to force Israel to release prisoners and to blow up
factories in Western countries.
   Rafsanjani criticized PLO leader Yasser Arafat for renouncing
terrorism and recognizing Israel's right to exist.
   He also brushed aside Western reaction to his support for
violence.
   ``Now they will start saying that so and so, as a man in charge,
and as the speaker of Parliament has officially called for acts of
terror ... But let them say it ... aren't they saying it now?''
   Soon after coming to power in the 1979 Islamic revolution,
Iran's leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, set aside May 5 as Quds
Day, referring to the Arabic name for Jerusalem. He has called on
Islamic nations to free Jerusalem, Islam's third holiest city after
Mecca and Medina, from Israeli rule.
   ``Those who give $10 billion a year to preserve Israel and know
what they are doing, is their blood worth anything?'' Rafsanjani
said.
   His remarks appeared to be a further deepening of the Iranian
campaign against the West, launched Feb. 14 by Khomeini with a
death sentence against British author Salman Rushdie for his book
``The Satanic Verses.''
   Khomeini said Rushdie blasphemed Islam in the book and used his
condemnation as a platform to attack slackening revolutionary zeal
in Iran.
   Western reaction to the death sentence, including 14 countries
that called home their top envoys from Tehran, led Khomeini and
other Iranian leaders to say ties with the West are unnecessary.
Diplomatic relations with Britain were severed.
   Rafsanjani was the leader of pragmatists seeking Western help to
rebuild after the ruinous war with Iraq that ended in a cease-fire
last year.
   But his recent pronouncements have been harsh toward the West,
including his statement last month that a spy ring that included
Iranian naval officers giving military and other secrets to the
United States had been broken.

   The robot probe Magellan streaked
across the solar system today at 25,000 mph on its way to Venus,
and the astronauts who launched the spacecraft turned to more
routine tasks aboard Atlantis.
   Deployment of the probe from the shuttle's cargo bay Thursday
night signaled a revival of an American planetary-science program
that has been dormant since 1978.
   ``The spacecraft is performing just beautifully. All systems are
operational and nominal. It couldn't be better,'' John Gerpheide,
Magellan project manager, said a few hours after the probe was
launched.
   Atlantis' fiery blastoff Thursday afternoon followed a
cliff-hanging, 59-minute wait that ground controllers and the five
astronauts endured because of the fickle Florida weather. With just
five minutes left in the shuttle's launch window, controllers found
a hole in the clouds and Atlantis thundered into the sky at 2:47
p.m. EDT.
   About six hours after the liftoff, Magellan was gently ejected
from the shuttle's cargo bay and the $550-million interplanetary
mission began.
   ``At last check, all systems were working exceptionally well on
Magellan,'' Mission Control commentator Jeffrey Carr said early
today.
   The space shuttle also was performing well, Carr said.
   Mission Control awoke the crew today at about 9:20 a.m. EDT with
a rousing rendition of the theme music from the movie ``Superman.''
   ``Good-morning and congratulations on a super day yesterday,''
Mission Control told the crew.
   ``Good morning Houston,'' commander David Walker replied.
``We're up and around. Everybody's feeling good, trying to find our
toothbrushes.
   ``We thank you for that fine wake-up music,'' Walker said.
   During the rest of the mission, the astronauts will try to
photograph lightning systems at night and attempt to grow crystals
of indium by melting and then re-solidying the material.
   The crew members also will take other photographs of the Earth
as well as test various systems on the orbiter. Another planned
project includes taking saliva samples during the flight to
determine how an anti-motion sickness drug is absorbed by the body
in zero gravity.
   Atlantis, in orbit 184 miles above the Earth, is scheduled to
land Monday afternoon at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
   ``It was really a wonderful day for us, the beginning of the
rebirth of the planetary program,'' Gerpheide said. ``It's the
beginning of a really grand set of missions which will last for
quite a few years.''
   ``While it's too early to tell about the major portion of
Magellan's mission, we're pleased it's gone so well so far,''
Walker said when told Magellan had been launched on its journey.
   Magellan was the first planetary craft deployed from a space
shuttle.
   The Magellan is moving at a rate of 25,000 mph, relative to
Earth, meaning it travels about 416 miles in just sixty seconds. At
its current rate, Magellan could get from Washington D.C. to New
York in a minute and could fly coast-to-coast in about seven
minutes.
   But it will take the spacecraft 15 months to travel to Venus,
the cloud-shrouded planet that is 158 million miles away. The probe
will loop 1{ times around the sun and travel 806 million miles
before reaching its destination in August 1990.
   Once in orbit above Venus, Magellan is to use its radar system
to map up to 90 percent of the planet's surface. The
high-resolution radar is expected to produce images of objects as
small as a football field _ 10 times the clarity of any previous
pictures of Venus.
   Venus, where the surface temperature is 900 degrees, has long
intrigued scientists because it is close in size to the Earth but
so different in many other ways. The sun rises in the west because
Venus rotates the opposite direction of Earth, and its rotation is
so slow that a day there lasts 243 Earth days.
   Magellan, named for the 16th-century Portuguese explorer, needed
to be launched by May 28 or it would have had to wait two years for
Earth and Venus to again be in a favorable alignment.
   NASA had tried to launch Atlantis last Friday, but a flaw
detected in a fuel pump halted the liftoff. Engineers later found
what appeared to be a leak in a hydrogen fuel line, and both parts
were replaced before Thursday's launch.
   Crew members on the mission, the 29th shuttle flight and the
fourth since the Challenger disaster, are Walker, pilot Ronald
Grabe, and mission specialists Norman Thagard, Mary Cleave and Mark
Lee.
   Magellan's mission marks the beginning of a new era in solar
system exploration that has been dormant since 1978 when the
Pioneer-Venus spacecraft was launched.
   In October, another Atlantis crew is to start the Galileo probe
on its way to Jupiter, the Hubble Space Telescope is scheduled for
launch from a shuttle early next year, Ulysses is to orbit the sun
in October 1990 and the Mars Observer spacecraft will be dispatched
in 1992 on an unmanned rocket.

   Four fraternity members have been
charged in connection with the mock kidnapping of a student from a
university classroom that a professor said looked terrifyingly real.
   One of the four, James E. Pennoyer III, the president of the
Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity, said today the charges were ``totally
ridiculous.''
   The student taken from the University of Rhode Island classroom
in December was a sorority member who was to be held until she
could raise her weight in food to be distributed to the poor.
   The four students surrendered to police and were arraigned
Thursday in District Court on charges of assault with a device
designed to be substantially similar in appearance to a firearm.
All were released on personal recognizance.
   The felony charge carries a potential prison term of three to 10
years upon conviction.
   Professor Margaret Haggerty said she brought the charges because
the university's discipline against the four was too light. Court
documents indicate they were placed on a year's probation by
university officials in March.
   According to the court records, the four burst into a classroom
Dec. 7 wearing bandanas and carrying replicas of Uzi submachine
guns and a fake handgun.
   Haggerty said the four were dressed like terrorists and she had
no idea the incident was part of a fund-raiser. ``I said, `Get out
of this room. Get out of this classroom.' I was more or less in
shock.''
   She said one masked invader pointed the handgun at her and
pulled the trigger as they left.
   The prank was inappropriate for the class, which explores the
impact of death on behavior, Haggerty said. About 40 students were
watching a film on medical ethics at the time of the mock
kidnapping, she said.
   ``A lot of students take that course because they recently
experienced death,'' she said.
   ``It was a philanthropic event, and this is a miscarriage of
justice,'' said Pennoyer, 21, of East Providence. ``We didn't do a
thing to her (Haggerty). We came in and took a student who knew we
were coming. It's totally ridiculous.''
   Also charged were David M. Jones, 20, of East Providence;
Antonio DaSilva, 23, of Pawtucket; and Michael I. Miga, 19, of
Warwick.

bipartisan agreement with President Bush.
   _Totals: $1.2 trillion in spending, $1.1 trillion in revenues, a
$99.4 billion deficit.
   _New tax revenue: $5.8 billion. Of the total, $5.3 billion will
be from taxes Congress and Bush will have to agree to, and $500
million will be from increased enforcement by the Internal Revenue
Service. Bush proposed $5.3 billion in this category.

selling as yet unspecified federal assets.
   _Military: $299.2 billion, $4.2 less than needed to keep pace
with inflation.
   _Entitlement programs: $556.4 billion in spending for programs
in which benefits are paid automatically to people who qualify,
$6.8 billion less than expected growth. Reductions include $2.7
billion from Medicare, $1.9 billion in farm payments and $1.1
billion from Postal Service and federal pension changes. Bush asked

   Venus may be ``a terrible place to
live,'' but scientists believe the planet's torrid temperatures,
incredible pressures and sulfuric acid rain may be a great place to
learn about the solar system's evolution.
   A robot craft called Magellan, the first American space probe in
11 years, is on its way to survey Venus for clues to the forces
that molded all the inner planets orbiting the sun.
   The $550 million craft will use a powerful radar imaging system
to map Venus' surface, where scientists believe the geologic
history of the planet is imprinted. By studying that history,
scientists hope to learn what's contained in the ``the missing
chapters'' of solar system evolution.
   Lennard Fisk, NASA's chief scientist, said Venus is known as the
Earth's sister planet because it is about the same size as Earth
and close to the same distance from the sun, in astronomical terms.
Venus, the second planet from the sun, is 67 million miles away,
while Earth, the third planet, is 93 million miles out.
   Despite the similarities, Venus ``has evolved into ... a
substantially different object,'' Fisk said.
   ``It has an atmosphere that is 90 times that of the Earth. It
has a runaway greenhouse effect. It has a surface temperature of
900 degrees. And it rains sulfuric acid,'' Fisk said. ``It would be
a terrible place to live.''
   The Earth and Venus, along with Mercury and Mars, are known as
the ``inner planets'' because of their grouping nearer to the sun
than the ``outer'' planets, such as Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus.
   The family of inner planets are all thought to have accreted, or
formed, 4.5 billion years ago. In the beginning, it's believed,
Venus and Earth were near-twins in size and character.
   But while the Earth went on to become a lovely, gentle world
thriving with life, Venus became a hellhole _ so hot that lead
melts on its surface.
   ``You've got to ask yourself why?'' Fisk said. ``You've got to
ask yourself if our own environment is that fragile? With only
small changes, could Earth evolve into a different place?''
   Magellan may help answer some of those questions.
   The spacecraft is scheduled to slip into Venus' orbit in August
1990, and spend the following 243 days mapping the planet's surface
with the most sophisticated radar ever sent to deep space.
   Radar signals are able to penetrate the dense cloud cover that
conceals Venus from telescopes on Earth. Radar views from Magellan
will be enhanced by NASA computers to give clear pictures of
powerful geologic forces at work on Venus.
   All the data could help experts ponder a fundamental question:
Is the Earth, like Venus, fated to one day become a barren,
lifeless world backing in superheat and bathed by acids?
   Scientists expect to find thousands of volcanoes rising from the
baked Venusian plains. Venus also has vast mountain ranges with
peaks towering higher than the Earth's Mount Everest.
   Most scientists believe the runaway greenhouse effect on Venus,
caused by its thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide, long ago caused
all water on the planet to boil away.
   The experts also will look for indications of continental drift,
the force that causes rock plates to inch about the globe over
millions of years.
   If there is evidence of volcanism and crustal drift on Venus, it
will prove that the planet retains enough internal heat to melt
rock. The internal heat machine is what creates the lava for
volcanoes and drives the movement of continents.
   Meteors crashing into the shallow surface crust of the planet
are expected to have left craters in every sector of Venus. Fisk
said these scars will be of particular interest to experts. The age
of a solid planet or moon, he said, can be calculated by the number
and distribution of craters.
   ``Knowing whether Earth is a fluke or just one of the natural
consequences of the evolution of a generic solar system'' will help
answer such questions, said Laurence Soderblom of the U.S.
Geological Survey in Flagstaff, Ariz.
   He said Magellan also may help scientists deduce ``the
probability you're going to find Earth-like planets _ and life _
somewhere else'' in the universe.

<TEXT>
   Two West Germans reportedly abducted in
south Lebanon reappeared early today, but a Palestinian guerrilla
said kidnappers were holding a third in connection with the case of
a Lebanese hijacker on trial in West Germany.
   There was no immmediate confirmation a third West German was
being held, and West German television said the Bonn government was
skeptical anyone was seized.
   ``We are still trying to find the facts,'' said West German
Ambassador Wolfgang Gottelman. In West Germany, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Hanns Schumacher said the two West German relief workers
who reappeared ``disappeared for a certain period of time and then
suddenly reappeared'' last year as well.
   The Sunni Moslem Nasserite militia said in a statement that
Heinrich Struebig and Petra Schnitzler were released at 5 a.m., 10
hours after being abducted, and drove to their office between the
Palestinian refugee camps of Ein El-Hilweh and Mieh Mieh, near the
southern port of Sidon.
   A Palestinian guerrilla officer in charge of security at the
base where the two work said the West Germans ``told me that the
kidnappers are keeping their colleague Marcus Michael ... in
connection with the case of Mohammed Ali Hamadi.
   ``There were three when they left yesterday evening. Only two of
them returned today,'' said the Palestinian, 1st Lt. Maarouf, who
uses only one name.
   Hamadi is a Lebanese Shiite Moslem on trial in Frankfurt, West
Germany, on murder and air piracy charges in the 1985 hijacking of
a TWA jetliner in which a U.S. Navy diver was killed.
   Neither Struebig, a 48-year-old administrator, nor Ms.
Schnitzler, a 26-year-old nurse, would speak to reporters after
their arrival in Sidon. They hid their faces from photographers.
   The commander of the PLO's military police in Sidon, Lt. Col.
Wajih Abu Ali, said this was because they feared for their
colleague.
   ``The released two told me they are scared because the
kidnappers have threatened to kill their third colleague if they
revealed any information about their abduction,'' said Abu Ali.
   Maarouf did not say if any demands had been made.
   Maarouf said he saw Struebig, Ms. Schnitzler and Michael leave
in a car together Thursday.
   Abu Ali said that based on his investigation, five gunmen in a
car intercepted the relief workers' van on the southern edge of
Sidon late Thursday, forced them into the car and ``sped away
toward the south.''
   Abu Ali said Struebig and Ms. Schnitzler were released in the
Zahrani area, six miles south of Sidon. He said they jumped into a
taxi that drove them to their base.
   In Sidon, the two met for 10 minutes with Mustafa Saad, who
heads the Sunni Moslem Nasserite militia, which is dominant in
Sidon. After that they were whisked out to waiting cars. Reporters
and photographers were not allowed into Saad's residence to cover
the meeting.
   Earlier, the militia's press officer, who identified himself
only as Ghassan, said his militia and the mainstream Shiite Moslem
Amal militia carried out ``nightlong efforts to locate the kidnap
victims. This cooperation led to their quick release.''
   The Syrian-backed Amal militia, led by Nabih Berri, controls
most of south Lebanon. Ghassan refused to identify the alleged
kidnappers.
   In West Germany, the ARD television network said the government
believes it ``peculiar'' that on April 6, 1988, the same two people
disappeared under similar circumstances and reappeared a short time
later.
   At that time, Steubig and Ms. Schnitzler were thought to have
been kidnapped and held two days, but the humanitarian group for
which they work, Asma-Humanitas, denied they were taken hostage.
   It said a pro-Iranian Shiite group involved with their
disappearance apologized to the two after discovering their
identities and sheltered them to protect them from fighting in the
area.
   ``The federal government obviously has doubts whether the two
actually were victims of a kidnapping,'' ARD said after Schumacher,
the Foreign Ministry spokesman, noted the 1988 incident. Schumacher
also said the government had no information about Michael.
   Abu Ali said Michael, 25, arrived in Lebanon eight days ago. He
also works for Asma-Humanitas, which has six employees in south
Lebanon.
   There are 15 foreigners held hostage in Lebanon, including nine
Americans. The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle
East correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped
March 16, 1985.
   In January 1987, two West Germans _ Rudolf Cordes and Alfred
Schmidt _ were kidnapped in Moslem west Beirut in an effort to win
freedom for Hamadi, who had been arrested in Frankfurt a short time
earlier.
   Both were eventually released. A pro-Iranian group, Holy
Warriors for Freedom, claimed responsibility for the abductions and
said the releases were a ``good will gesture'' to win a lenient
sentence for Hamadi, who faces life in prison.
   Hamadi's elder brother, Abbas Hamadi, was convicted in West
Germany of those kidnappings.

   Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Party today lost
a parliamentary seat it has held for 38 years, suffering a sharp
rebuff as she marked her 10th anniversary as prime minister.
   In a huge 12.5 percent swing against the government, the
socialist Labor Party captured the Vale of Glamorgan, a largely
rural Welsh district, with a 6,028-vote majority. That overturned
the Conservatives' 6,251-vote majority in 1987 general elections.
   ``This is what the new modern Labor Party can do ... Mrs.
Thatcher's days are numbered,'' declared victor John Smith, who won
a House of Commons seat left vacant by the death of a lawmaker.
   Defeated Conservative Rod Richards acknowledged votes were lost
over Mrs. Thatcher's plans to overhaul property taxes and the
National Health Service, and to sell off the national water and
electricity utilities.
   ``We have to win that debate in the country and it will take
time because we're changing something quite radically and people
are naturally concerned as to how it will affect them,'' he said.
   Smith retorted: ``My Conservative opponent had to defend the
indefensible. This was a test of Mrs. Thatcher's 10 years in office
and the people of the Vale of Glamorgan made it absolutely clear
that she's not wanted.''
   Health Secretary Kenneth Clarke dismissed the result as a minor
midterm setback.
   Labor also scored heavily off the two divided center parties,
whose support collapsed.
   Smith polled 23,342 votes to the Tories' 17,314. The centrist
Social and Liberal Democratic Party took only 2,017 and the Social
Democractic Party, its previous electoral ally, got 1,098. The
Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru also did badly with 1,672 votes.
   The election of the 38-year-old business studies lecturer shaved
Mrs. Thatcher's majority in the 650-member House of Commons to 101
_ still ample to assure passage of her ambitious reforms.
   The Conservatives have 375 seats, Labor 228, the Social and
Liberal Democrats 19 and the Social Democratic Party 3. Minority
regional parties hold the rest.
   It is only the fourth time in 25 years that Labor has snatched a
seat from the Conservatives in a by-election.
   The centrist parties acknowledged they paid heavily for their
split after the last general election in 1987, and the rivalries
that have become known as ``the muddle in the middle.''
   Mrs. Thatcher, who celebrated her 10th anniversary by declaring
she had transformed Britain, faced more problems on the industrial
front.
   She swept to power on a wave of anti-union sentiment May 4,
1979, after a winter of strikes in which garbage piled up across
the country, hospitals turned away the sick and the dead were left
unburied.
   But now, strikes over pay or conditions loom on the state
railroad, in the docks, the engineering industry, the electricity
supply service, the fire-fighting service, the London subway and
among news staff at the British Broadcasting Corp.
   London's liberal newspaper The Guardian predicted today Britain
is heading for its worst industrial strife since a yearlong coal
miners' strike collapsed in 1985.
   Some Conservative legislators claim the unrest may be an
organized campaign. ``This is beginning to look like a
conspiracy,'' said Tory legislator Harry Greenway.
   The Institute of Directors, an employers' organization,
meanwhile reported that confidence in the British economy among
company directors has fallen the last two months. It said those
listed as ``more optimistic'' dropped from 29 percent to 19
percent, while more than half said they were ``less optimistic.''

   The government is investigating trading
practices of more than 50 dealers at four New York commodities
markets in criminal and civil probes that follow a similar
crackdown in Chicago.
   The criminal investigation at the sprawling New York trading
pits at the World Trade Center reportedly focuses on a firm whose
president was cited for regulatory violations in 1985.
   About 16 agents from the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Thursday subpoenaed the
Commodity Exchange; the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange; the New
York Cotton Exchange; and the New York Mercantile Exchange. No
arrests were made or arrest warrants issued.
   The CFTC, a federal regulatory agency, is seeking information
about trading practices by firms and individuals in a civil
investigation, the exchanges said in statements.
   The Manhattan U.S. attorney's office is leading another criminal
probe that involved seizing documents from two offices of a single
firm, which sources identified as MBF Clearing Corp.
   The firm is run by Mark Bradley Fisher, a Comex member who paid
$60,000 to settle trading practice violations with the CFTC in 1985.
   U.S. Postal Service inspector Jack Ellis said document searches
authorized in two warrants were conducted ``at two different
offices of the same individual'' _ rooms 992 and 9926 at 4 World
Trade Center.
   The National Futures Association in Chicago lists the address of
MBF Clearing as room 992 of 4 World Trade Center. A building
directory also lists the firms MBF Trading and Dollar Index
Services as operating from the office.
   Traders said at least three silver futures traders from one
company were called off the the floor of the Commodity Exchange,
while an independent trader was called from the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   All the subpoenaed exchanges said they would cooperate with the
CFTC, which can bring civil charges. The New York Futures Exchange
was not a target of the probe, officials said.
   Mercantile Exchange President Rosemary T. McFadden said the CFTC
subpoenaed the exchange for information from the last two years on
20 present or former Nymex members.
   ``We do not know what the scope of their investigation is at the
present time nor specifically what they are targeting in on,''
McFadden said.
   The Commodity Exchange said it was ordered to produce documents
on about 27 past and present exchange members by May 17, while six
individual traders were subpoenaed directly. The Coffee, Sugar and
Cocoa Exchange and the New York Cotton Exchange said they were
subpoenaed about an unspecified number of members.
   The exchanges trade commodities from oil to frozen orange juice.
   The commodities are bought and sold on a sprawling floor by
traders shouting orders in chaotic pits, which are monitored by
officials from the CFTC and the individual exchanges.
   Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said
CFTC and exchange officials will testify before the committee on
May 17 at a hearing on floor trading practices at the nation's
exchanges. The agriculture committee oversees the CFTC, which is up
for congressional reauthorization this year.
   Leahy said the committee has been reviewing trading practices at
the New York and Chicago exchanges since mid-January and the New
York investigation would be addressed at the hearing.
   Chicago U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas refused to comment on the
New York probe, but a source in his office who spoke on condition
of anonymity said it was unrelated to the Justice Department
investigations at the Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
   No indictments have been announced, but as many as 200 subpoenas
reportedly have been issued to traders and firms at the Chicago
exchanges.
   The New York Times today quoted unnamed government officials as
saying the New York probe focused on a number of issues, including
so-called tax trades. In such deals, which can be illegal,
pre-arranged trades are executed to include false losses and defer
income.

   Crimestoppers Tip No. 236: always
question the curator.
   Authorities in Rye Brook did just that, and solved The Case of
the Missing Comic Strips by arresting 27-year-old Sherman Krisher
of Greenwich, Conn., who allegedly swiped 30 original ``Dick
Tracy'' cartoons.
   The former curator at the Museum of Cartoon Art was charged
Thursday with stealing more than $50,000 worth of original comic
strips, including Tracy and ``Prince Valiant'' panels, said
Westchester County District Attorney Carl Vergari.
   Krisher, who worked his way up from janitor to curator in seven
years at the museum, was charged with grand larceny in the second
degree.
   Rye Town Justice Bruno Gioffre released Krisher in his own
recognizance after his arraignment on the charges Thursday morning,
said Assistant District Attorney Tony Berk. Krisher is due back in
court on May 18.
   More than 50 strips were taken and allegedly sold to comic strip
dealers. The theft was discovered in January, Museum Director
Barbara Hammond said, and Krisher confessed to theft and was fired
in March.
   ``The temptation was too great,'' she said.
   The Dick Tracy strips were valued at up to $2,000 each,
according to collectors. The strips of the syndicated cartoon had
been donated to the museum by its creator, Chester Gould.

   President Bush is expected to name Gwendolyn
King, a former aide to President Reagan, as the new head of the
Social Security Administration, an administration source said today.
   She would succeed Dorcas Hardy as commissioner of the
80,000-employee agency.
   Ms. King is the ``odds on favorite'' for the post, and her
nomination by Bush is anticipated, said the source who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   In a telephone interview today, Ms. King acknowledged she is
under consideration for the post but has yet to receive a call from
Bush.
   ``I stand ready to serve at the president's pleasure,'' she said.
   Ms. King worked in the Reagan White House as a presidential
deputy assistant and director of the Office of Intergovernmental
Affairs.
   She is currently vice president of Gogol and Associates, a
Washington-based government relations firm.
   She was previously an assistant to Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., and
former Pennsylvania Gov. Richard Thornburgh, who is now attorney
general in Bush's Cabinet. She headed Thornburgh's Washington
office.

<HEAD>Estonia Ousts 22 Party Leaders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party in the republic of Estonia
removed 22 party leaders in a sweep that gives greater strength to
reformers, officials and Estonian reporters said today.
   The 22 dropped from the Central Committee included former party
chief Karl G. Vaino, said Estonian Foreign Ministry spokesman Valle
Feldman.
   The party leaders were removed during a meeting Thursday of the
120-member Central Committee. The sweep strengthens newer party
leaders who generally are more progressive and tend to support
sovereignty for the tiny Baltic republic.
   Estonian People's Front leader Marju Lauristen, who spoke at
Thursday's meeting, accused some of the retiring members of
involvement in the exile of tens of thousands of Estonians in the
1940s and 1950s, an Estonian reporter said.
   Lauristen said several of the former Central Committee members
were ``big bosses who participated in the deportations,'' Estonian
radio reporter Sulev Hallik said in a telephone interview.
   Feldman said the Communist Party's declining popularity was a
factor in Thursday's action. A recent public opinion poll in
Estonia found that more than 50 percent of residents support the
People's Front, a grass-roots nationalist group, while only 7
percent back the Communist Party, he said.
   The Estonian Communist Party ``must now take radical steps and
quickly work out a program'' if it wants to hold its own among
other political groups that are flourishing in Estonia, Feldman
said.
   The 22 were removed ``according to their own request'' in a move
similar to the housecleaning last week in Moscow that dropped 110
former officials from the national Communist Party's leadership, he
said.
   ``They were, to a great degree, responsible for the sad position
we're in now, so of course they should take the consequences for
it,'' Feldman said.
   Vaino, who served as Estonian Communist Party chief for almost a
decade, was replaced in June 1988 after months of criticism for
inaction on pollution and corruption.
   His replacement, Vaino I. Vyalyas, is a reformer supported by
the Popular Front. Yet he mildly criticized the group during
Thursday's meeting for seeking to return Estonia to the past,
before the Soviets occupied it in 1940, Feldman said.
   Vyalyas attacked several of Estonia's newspapers for supporting
the radical Estonian National Independence Party, which seeks
Estonian secession from the Soviet Union, said Eve Parnaste, a
leader of that group.
   Feldman said Vyalyas also criticized Interdvizhenie, a largely
Russian group that objects to rising nationalism and political
reform.

<TEXT>
   Officials at Sea-Arama Marineworld are
mourning the sudden death of a Pacific black whale that arrived at
the Galveston marine park only a month ago.
   Although the precise cause of death has not been determined, an
autopsy on the 13-foot whale revealed tumors throughout the
carcass, Cheryl Snyder, a caretaker at Sea-Arama, said Thursday.
   The whale, called Nami, was one of two such whales to arrive
April 2. Caretakers were making regular checks on Wednesday when
they noticed the whale was having difficulty swimming and
breathing. Although trainers swam with the whale and tried to keep
it breathing, it died within about 10 minutes.
   ``We were right there with her the whole time and we still don't
know what happened,'' Ms. Snyder said.
   ``It was just very emotional for all of us because it was so
unexpected. She had shown no sign at all of being ill earlier in
the day.''
   The second whale, called Tanoshi, appears to be healthy, she
says.
   The two whales were among four captured in December by
commercial fishermen in Japan. The two others went to a zoo in
Indianapolis.

   A federal judge today ordered a former
Unisys Corp. representative to perform 200 hours of community
service for conspiring to conceal illegal political contributions
from defense contractors.
   U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton also gave Robert D. Barrett,
55, a suspended three-year prison sentence and two years' probation.
   Barrett pleaded guilty Jan. 27 to conspiring to defraud the
Federal Election Commission and to causing the filing of false FEC
reports that concealed two $1,000 donations to former Rep. William
Chappell Jr., D-Fla.
   Barrett admitted to a complicated scheme to funnel the
contributions to Chappell's re-election campaign from companies
that, along with Unisys, provided technical services to the
Pentagon.
   Chappell, who died last month, denied knowing that his campaign
had received the illegal corporate donations. He was not charged in
the case.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Aronica told the judge that
Barrett's cooperation with the ``Operation Ill-Wind'' probe of
Pentagon procurement fraud had ``resulted in the rapid movement of
the investigation and has opened up other areas of investigation.''
   Aronica noted that Barrett's cooperation led to several other
guilty pleas by Unisys officials. The company sells computer
equipment and fire control devices to the Defense Department.
   Defense attorney James Bensfield noted that Barrett's two
convictions were for charges that are ``usually prosecuted
administratively by the FEC.''
   ``We're not talking about bribes here. We're not talking about
the misuse of sensitive procurment information,'' Bensfield said.
   The fraud investigation has resulted in several convictions of
defense consultants and contractors charged with paying bribes to
obtain inside information on Pentagon procurement plans.
   Bensfield said Barrett was ``carrying out the orders of his only
boss in the corporation'' when he arranged to funnel the illegal
campaign conributions to Chappell's re-election fund.
   Barrett told the judge, ``I made the mistake of trying to be a
good soldier ... I've learned a lot this last year. I'll never make
the same mistake again.''

   An Air Force fighter pilot accidentally
dropped a live 500-pound bomb over a sparsely populated rural area,
narrowly missing homes in this west Georgia town. No one was hurt.
   The incident occurred Thursday afternoon as the F-16 ``Fighting
Falcon'' was returning to Moody Air Force Base at Valdosta after a
training exercise at Fort Benning, said Fort Benning spokesman Bill
Walton.
   The pilot, who was not identified, had tried to release the bomb
over Fort Benning's Kilo Impact Area during the exercise, but the
bomb did not release. About 3:15 p.m., when the plane was returning
to its home base at Moody, the bomb fell, Walton said.
   A Air Force spokeswoman at Moody, Capt. Cynthia Nelson, at first
said the bomb was only a dummy and could not have exploded, but
said she later learned it was live and did detonate.
   Marion County Sheriff Horace Snider said it landed in a wooded
area near Brantley, destroying some pine trees. ``If it was a
thousand yards up the road, it would have hit 10 to 15 houses in
the community of Brantley,'' he said.
   Snider said the impact also rattled windows and knocked pictures
from the walls of the nearest house.
   Fort Benning's Range Control reported the accident to post
authorities, and a search party was sent to look for the bomb. It
was found about 6:30 p.m., Walton said.

<TEXT>
   A controversial hymnal giving United
Methodists a mix of gospel standards and more contemporary hymns
drew rave reviews as the songbook made its formal debut at an
international gathering of church leaders.
   ``I think they have a good blend of the old and the new,'' said
Jackie Chrismon of Hope Mills. Her husband, Pete Chrismon, pastor
of Hope Mills United Methodist Church, said the inclusion of
worship guides would aid churchgoers.
   ``It looks like the hymns are very singable,'' said Curt Kollar,
a member of Benson Memorial United Methodist Church in Raleigh. ``I
like the fact that they dropped all those `amens' at the end.''
   At a ``service of thanksgiving and consecration'' Thursday
night, an overflow crowd at Edenton Street United Methodist Church
broke the paper seals around the updated hymnals, then sang a
rousing rendition of ``O For a Thousand Tongues to Sing'' by
Charles Wesley, brother of Methodist founder John Wesley.
   ``This is more than a collection of hymns; it is the book of
worship for our denomination,'' Bishop Rueben Job, chairman of the
Hymnal Revision Committee, told the congregation.
   The denomination's General Conference decided in 1984 to update
the hymnal and agreed on a final version last year, according to
Thomas McAnally, spokesman for the United Methodist Church.
   But what church leaders thought would be a quiet process erupted
into spirited protests with the suggestion that ``Onward Christian
Soldiers'' be eliminated because of its militaristic lyrics. The
hymn, without modification, is in the new hymnal.
   ``Little did we realize when we started to do a hymnal that it
would have any interest beyond the denomination,'' said McAnally,
noting the national attention the debate has received.
   Among the new inclusions are Andre Crouch's ``To God Be The
Glory'' and Bill Gaither's ``He Touched Me,'' McAnally said.
   ``Carlton Young, the book's editor, has observed that people
take their hymns very seriously and take their hymn books very
personally,'' said McAnally. ``It's in their memory banks and they
connect events in their lives, happy and unhappy, with hymns they
have sung.''
   Efforts to update hymns with more contemporary language and to
make male metaphors more gender-inclusive also drew long debate,
McAnnally said.
   For example, ``Good Christian Men Rejoice'' became ``Good
Christian Friends Rejoice.'' In the Wesley hymn ``Christ the Lord
is Risen Today,'' the line ``sons of men and angels say'' now reads
``earth and heaven and chorus say.''
   Raleigh was chosen for the hymnal's debut because it is the site
of this week's Council of Bishops, a meeting of 100 United
Methodist bishops from the United States, Europe, Africa and the
Philippines.

   Oliver North was a credible witness and warm
person, says one of the jurors who voted to convict the former
White House aide after days of deliberations often filled with
``bickering and arguing.''
   But the juror, Earl F. Williams, 65, also seems torn over
whether North, facing up to 10 years' imprisonment, should spend
time behind bars.
   ``I believed him,'' Williams said Thursday after the jury found
North guilty of three of 12 counts against him. ``No, I don't think
he should go to jail. Colonel North, I don't know if he's all that
bad or all that good. He made some mistakes.''
   But interviewed today on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America,''
Williams first equivocated and then appeared to change his mind.
   ``Do you think he should go to jail?'' Williams was asked.
   ``Well, whether he should go to jail or not is not my, is not
for me to say,'' he replied.
   Pressed for his opinion, however, Williams said: ``Well,
personally, I feel that if he's guilty he should go to jail. Which
he is, so, you know ....''
   Williams, a former security guard who had served with Gen.
George Patton's 3rd Army in World War II, said the jury did not
agree on the guilty counts until Thursday, the 12th day of
deliberations, although some of the acquittals had been decided
earlier.
   The last charge to be decided was whether North altered and
shredded government documents, the District of Columbia resident
said. He said the question was over whether North had criminal
intent.
   North was also convicted of obstructing Congress and accepting
an illegal gratuity.
   ``The jury was split a while on some of the counts, and in a
case such as this there is a lot of bickering and arguing,'' he
said. ``But with God's help we prayed a lot and made a decision.''
   Williams said the nine female jurors, ``were really set in their
ways, but after prayer, a little consideration and friendly talking
they came right in with us.'' But he did not say in what direction
anyone had to be persuaded.
   Still, there were no dominant characters on the jury, Williams
said. ``We were all pretty strong ... it was touch and go ... at
one time this person might be a little strong and another time that
person might be a little strong.''
   Other jurors were too exhausted and ready to return to their
families to say much about the deliberations.
   Calling the verdict the hardest decision she ever had to make,
Justine Newell Parrish, a 39-year-old Washington resident, said
that ``I just want to be with my family.''
   ``I'm going to take my shower and catch the next flight out of
here to Jamaica,'' said juror Jean Johnson, a 53-year-old cashier
in the district.
   The husband of juror Gina Lynch, 37, a lab technician from
Washington, is hoping that life for the couple and their three
children will be back to normal in a few days.
   Frank Lynch, a mental health counselor, said his wife went into
seclusion, but not before taking their three children out for
seafood.
   ``I'm glad things will be back to normal,'' Lynch said because,
``the kids missed her.''

   A U.N.-sponsored conference today
called for financial aid, possibly including a new international
fund, to help developing countries phase out chemicals that damage
the earth's protective ozone shield.
   The compromise proposal for a world climate fund was adopted
after private consultations among delegates of nine industrial and
Third World countries.
   Mostafa K. Tolba, head of the U.N. Environment Program,
adjourned the meeting Thursday to break a deadlock whether to have
such a fund.
   ``This is the decision in principle that I wanted,'' Tolba told
reporters.``What remains is more difficult, to make it concrete.''
   Industrial countries objected to demands to a fund that they
said could be expensive to set up and administer. Third World
countries wanted to ensure that assistance would not be drawn from
existing aid programs.
   Earlier, the conference called for a worldwide ban by the year
2000 on chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, which are used in
refrigeration, some plastics and insulation.
   CFCs break down the ozone layer high above the earth that
filters out ultraviolet radiation from the sun, increasing the risk
of skin cancer and eye disease.
   The delegates agreed that developing countries needed assistance
to replace the technologies and equipment they inherited from the
industrial countries.
   Scientists said the threat of ozone depletion can be averted
only if CFC emissions are stopped altogether.
   The adopted resolution said the conference ``recognizes the
urgent need to establish international financial and other
mechanisms'' to help developing countries.
   It set up an ``open-ended working group to develop modalities
for such mechanisms ... that do not exclude the possibility of an
international fund.''
   The working group is to report next year to a second follow-up
conference of the 1987 Montreal Protocol, which was the first
treaty to establish controls on the production and use of CFCs.
   U.S. delegation leader Eileen Claussen said she is satisfied
with the funding resolution, which she said filled the ``obvious
need for some financing on an international level.
   ``The paper is fine,'' said Ms. Claussen, deputy director of the
Environmental Protection Agency. ``It was a good mood in the
working group. After all, we're all in this together trying to do
the same thing.''
   Finland's Environment Minister Kaj Barlund, who championed the
idea of a world climate fund, said the resolution was ``close to
what we wanted.''
   But he acknowledged that the vague wording may make it difficult
to get the fund working.
   The compromise was worked out among delegation heads from the
United States, Soviet Union, Japan, Mexico, China, Senegal, Tobago,
Malaysia, and New Zealand.

<HEAD>South African Minister Proposes Black Role In Parliament</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior Cabinet minister said
today the government wants to bring the black majority into
Parliament and the executive branch, but only if the white minority
cannot be overruled.
   Security for the country's 5 million whites can be ensured
``only in an environment of progress, safety and justice for all
the people of South Africa,'' Constitutional Development Minister
Chris Heunis said in a speech to Parliament.
   South Africa's 28 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs and no representation in Parliament or the Cabinet.
   Heunis' speech was a relatively comprehensive summary of various
proposals he and other government officials have mentioned in
recent months. Heunis said details of a new constitutional system
would have to be negotiated, and thus he offered few specifics
about the new role envisioned for blacks.
   Thus far, no prominent black leaders have accepted the
government's invitation to participate in constitutional
negotiations. Militant blacks have rejected Heunis' plans, while
some moderate blacks have indicated they would negotiate if the
government freed imprisoned black leaders such as Nelson Mandela
and lifted bans on black opposition groups.
   Speculation the government may free Mandela after general
elections on Sept. 6 increased today when Mandela was visited at a
prison farm near Cape Town by Harry Gwala, a terminally ill
colleague freed from jail in November.
   Gwala, who is suffering from a neurological disease, refused to
say who initiated the meeting. Both men are 70 and have been
members of the African National Congress since the 1940s. Until
Gwala's release, both were serving life sentences for involvement
with the outlawed guerrilla movement.
   Previous attempts to free Mandela have been blocked by the
nationalist leader's refusal to renounce violence in the fight for
majority rule.
   In Parliament, Heunis rejected charges the government's
proposals are vague and insincere.
   ``Everyone has to become participants in legislative, executive
and judicial institutions because fairness demands it, and also
because this will ensure progress, safety and justice for the white
man,'' he said.
   He said the governing National Party wants a South Africa ``in
which the grievances of the past were dead and buried and in which
all people could walk tall.''
   Referring to policies which divide South Africans by race,
Heunis said the government remains committed ``to the protection of
those groups wanting to be recognized as groups.'' But he indicated
the government is willing to negotiate possible changes in laws
mandating racial classification.
   Government policies ``implied that all the political entities''
in South Africa could have a role in electing a head of state,
serving on the Cabinet and serving in Parliament. But he said the
National Party seeks a system ``in which numbers would not play a
decisive role.''

   The chief judge in the trial of
TWA hijacker Mohammed Ali Hamadi said today the proceedings will
not be influenced by the reported kidnapping of West Germans in
Lebanon.
   A Palestinian guerrilla officer in south Lebanon said three West
German relief workers were seized in connection with the Hamadi
case. He said two were freed today but that the third was still
held.
   There was no confirmation of the report.
   ``It has already been said several times that the work of the
court cannot be influenced by such events,'' Chief Judge Heiner
Mueckenberger said in a brief telephone interview.
   Hamadi is on trial in Frankfurt in connection with the hijacking
of TWA Flight 847 on June 14, 1985. U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem
was killed and 39 Americans were held hostage for 17 days. Hamadi
admitted taking part in the kidnapping but denies killing Stethem.
   Prosecutors have urged a murder conviction and life sentence,
and the judge has said a verdict could come this month.
   Shortly after Hamadi's arrest in January 1987, two West Germans
were seized in Lebanon. A pro-Iranian group, Holy Warriors for
Freedom, claimed responsibility for the abductions and said their
eventual releases were a ``goodwill gesture'' to win a lenient
sentence for Hamadi.
   Hamadi's elder brother, Abbas, was convicted in West Germany of
those kidnappings.
   Mueckenberger said he was not familiar with all the details of
the latest incident in Lebanon, which apparently began Thursday
evening.
   The Sunni Moslem Nasserite militia in Lebanon said Heinrich
Struebig and Petra Schnitzler were released at 5 a.m. today. 1st
Lt. Maarouf, a Palestinian guerrilla officer in charge of security
at the base where the two work, said the West Germans ``told me
that the kidnappers are keeping their colleague Marcus Michael ...
in connection with the case of Mohammed Ali Hamadi.
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman, Hanns Schumacher, said only that
the trial ``could lead to a threat against Germans, that is clear.
But everything else is pure speculation.''
   He noted that Struebig and Ms. Schnitzler ``disappeared for a
certain period of time and then suddenly reappeared'' in April
1988. He said the government had no information about Michael.
   His comments prompted the ARD television network to comment in
its 1 p.m. newscast: ``The federal government obviously has doubts
whether the two actually were victims of a kidnapping.''
   ARD claimed the government believes it is ``peculiar'' that in
1988 the pair disappeared under similar circumstances and
reappeared a short time later.
   In 1988, Steubig and Ms. Schnitzler were thought to have been
kidnapped and held two days, but the humanitarian group for which
they work, Asma-Humanitas, denied they were taken hostage.
   It said a pro-Iranian Shiite group involved with their
disappearance apologized after discovering their identities and
sheltered them to protect them from fighting in the area.
   Another Foreign Ministry spokesman, Rainer Mueller, said
officials had warned Asma-Humanitas workers many times about the
dangers of working in Lebanon.
   There are 15 foreigners held hostage there, including nine
Americans. The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle
East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March
16, 1985.

<HEAD>Outcome Of Genetic Tests To Determine If Man Is Missing Son</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A couple are anxiously awaiting
the results of genetic tests to determine if a New York man who
claims he was abducted when he was a child is their son.
   Joe and Marjean Hagans' 3-year-old son Jonathan wandered away
from them at Jacksonville Beach on June 11, 1968. Police speculated
the boy had stumbled onto a nearby boat ramp or slipped into the
ocean and drowned.
   No trace of the boy was found.
   Mrs. Hagans, however, said she never believed her son was dead
and launched her own search.
   Four months ago, the couple contacted the Florida Department of
Law Enforcement and asked that the investigation be reopened.
   The state referred the case to Jacksonville Beach Police Chief
Paul Brown, who agreed ``as a courtesy basically to get the
information on the national computer again.'' Brown, as a young
police sergeant, had investigated the boy's disappearnce in 1968.
   Meanwhile, David Bonnabel of Buffalo, N.Y., was pursuing his
belief that he was abducted as a toddler and raised in isolation by
a widow who lived in a camper somewhere near Lafayette, La. He said
he was abused and kept from attending school.
   Bonnabel said he ran away when he was 15 and supported himself
by working odd jobs. He now runs an interior decorating business
and has invested thousands of dollars trying to locate his family.
   At the same time the Hagans got the case of their son reopened
in Florida, an associate of Bonnabel was checking with Florida
authorities for records of disappearances similar to Bonnabel's
account.
   An investigator who worked with Bonnabel saw similarities in his
case and Jonathan Hagans' disappearance and passed the information
on to him.
   Mrs. Hagans said she was overwhelmed when she met Bonnabel.
   ``I want to smother him with love. I'm a mother and I guess I
want to pile up all those years and just put them together,'' she
said.
   But Bonnabel added about the genetics tests, being run by the
FBI: ``We won't be sure for two to six weeks. We want to keep a low
profile.''

<TEXT>
   The parents of a University of Texas
student killed and mutilated by cultist drug smugglers in Mexico
are starting a committee to lead a campaign to fight drug dealing
and drug usage.
   ``There will be change only when the people demand it,'' James
Kilroy told a group of about 600 people at a town meeting called by
him and his wife, Helen.
   ``Drugs cross state lines,'' Kilroy said. ``Drugs are a problem
defeating our nation.''
   Their committee is called Make A Reponsible Kommitment _ or MARK
_ named after their son, Mark, who was abducted from a street in
Matamoros, Mexico, during a spring break trip. His mutilated body
was found in a shallow grave on a ranch near Matamoros, the victim
of a drug smuggler cult that believed human sacrifice would protect
their drug operation.
   ``We want to let everybody know there is a lot of outrage in
this country against drugs,'' Kilroy said. ``The only way to to
that is to try to unite all the organizations _ churches, clubs,
anybody.''
   Mrs. Kilroy said she hoped her son's death would serve as a
rallying point.
   ``I think every parent, brother and sister see their brother,
sister or son in Mark,'' she said.
   The group is calling for mandatory drug tests after auto
accidents and arrests, mandatory three-year terms in drug
rehabilitation and education for drug users and similar four-year
terms for sellers, and 10-year work programs for second offenders.

   A mild earthquake below the ocean floor
shook a wide stretch of San Diego County today, but there were no
immediate reports of damage or injuries.
   The temblor registered 3.4 on the Richter scale, struck at 7:11
a.m. and was centered beneath the seabed 27 miles southwest of
Oceanside, said Amy Branch, a seismologist at the California
Institute of Technology in Pasadena.
   The county Sheriff's Department received no immediate reports of
damage or injury.
   Two residents of El Cajon, which is east of San Diego and
perhaps 50 miles from the epicenter, called Metro Weather, a radio
service, to report shaking, said forecaster Tim Root.
   Scientists believed the temblor was an aftershock of a
5.3-magnitude quake that struck July 13, 1986, Ms. Branch said.

<HEAD>Three Men Held For Questioning In Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NOUMEA, New Caledonia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three men were being held for
questioning in the slaying of the two senior leaders of the
independence movement in this French Pacific territory, prosecutors
said today.
   French Premier Michel Rocard said he would fly to New Caledonia
to attend the funeral on Sunday of Jean-Marie Tjibaou, president of
the Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front, and his top
assistant, Yeiwene Yeiwene.
   Rocard also said New Caledonian elections planned June 11 would
be postponed because the traditional period of mourning would still
be in progress. No new date was announced.
   Police say the two men were shot to death Thursday by Djubelly
Wea, a hard-line separatist who opposed Tjibaou's moderate
policies. Wea was killed by Tjibaou's bodyguards after the attack,
which occurred on the island of Ouvea.
   The prosecutor's office identified the three in custody as
Paoula Wea, a nephew of Wea; Andre Tangopi; and Fessen Tuet.
Authorities provided no details of their alleged involvement in the
attack.
   Tangopi was wounded in the exchange of gunfire and was under
police guard in the hospital at Noumea, the provincial capital.
   The senior surviving leader of the front, Leopold Joredie, said
today the group would stick to its commitment to participate in a
``peace process'' that began last year and is to culminate in a
1998 referendum on independence.
   ``The word of Jean-Marie Tjibaou will be respected, and we
pledge to make sure that the process is followed to its
conclusion,'' Joredie said.
   Joredie, a witness to the killings, said he thought at least
five or six gunmen were involved.
   The group announced it was calling off ceremonies planned to
mark the first anniversary of the May 5 assault by French military
gendarmes on a cave where separatists were holding more than 20
other gendarmes hostage. The fighting left 19 of the hostage-takers
and two gendarmes dead.
   Tjibaou, Yeiwene and Joredie were in Ouvea to take part in the
ceremonies when Thursday's attack occurred.
   Native Melanesians, known as Kanaks, make up 43 percent of the
inhabitants of New Caledonia, a group of islands 1,000 miles east
of Australia. Most favor independence. European settlers and their
descendants make up 37 percent, nearly all of whom want to remain
part of France.
   The rest of the people are Polynesians and Asians, also
favorable to retaining the link to France, but the Melanesian
population is growing much faster than the others and is expected
to be in the majority again early in the next century.

<HEAD>Hoffman Gave Away Fortune, Left $2,000</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Abbie Hoffman gave away hundreds of
thousands of dollars during his lifetime, but left an estate worth
only about $2,000, according to his attorney.
   ``It's not that he didn't take in a lot of money. It's just that
he didn't keep it,'' Gerald Lefcourt said Thursday.
   Hoffman, 52, who committed suicide April 12 in his apartment
near New Hope, named Johanna Lawrenson as sole beneficiary in his
will, which was filed Wednesday in Bucks County.
   Ms. Lawrenson and Hoffman had lived together for several years.
   The 1983 will was accompanied by a death certificate listing his
full name as Abbott Howard Hoffman and his self-described
occupation as ``Jewish Road Warrior.''
   He left instructions in the will for Ms. Lawrenson to choose a
final resting place for his ashes and said disposal ``shall be as
inexpensive as possible.''
   Hoffman had several hundred dollars in the bank, a small
retirement account and personal effects of an undetermined value,
Lefcourt said. A $10,000 bank loan was covered by an insurance
policy.
   The $2,000 figure ``is just an approximate value of his
estate,'' Lefcourt said. ``I'm not sure if it's realistic.''
   Hoffman gave away ``hundreds of thousands of dollars, maybe
millions'' he had earned through his books, magazine articles and
speaking engagements, Lefcourt said.
   In 1970, Hoffman received a check for about $40,000 after
negotiating a movie contract for his book, ``Revolution for the
Hell of it,'' and immediately signed the check over to the Black
Panther bail fund, Lefcourt said. ``It didn't even go through his
account.''

   A 60-year-old socialist woman could become Japan's
prime minister, an event that would turn this conservative,
male-dominated country on its ear.
   Takako Doi, a veteran of 20 years in parliament, is chairwoman
of the Japan Socialist Party, the largest opposition party. She is
pressing opposition's case now that the governing Liberal
Democratic Party is mired in scandal.
   The former law professor has not directly expressed an ambition
to be prime minister, but she would probably have the first shot if
the Liberal Democrats fail badly in a general election and the
Socialists win more seats than the other smaller parties.
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita said April 25 that he will step
down soon to take responsibility for a loss of public trust because
of an influence-peddling scandal. His conservative party, in power
since it was formed in 1955, has yet to decide on a successor, and
many party leaders are ruled out because of their links to the
scandal.
   The Liberal Democrats are expected to put forward a
second-ranking figure as a sort of interim prime minister and try
to regain the public's trust before a general election that would
give the Socialists a chance to oust the long-governing party.
   ``This is a golden opportunity for opposition parties to take
over the governing power from the hands of the Liberal Democratic
Party,'' Ms. Doi told reporters this week.
   ``If we fail to take advantage of this situation, we may as well
remain minority oppositionists eternally.''
   The Liberal Democrats have ignored her calls to let the
opposition form a minority government in the Diet, or parliament.
So the only alternative for the Socialists is to prevent the ruling
party from winning the next election for the lower house, where the
Liberal Democrats hold 297 of the 512 seats.
   A lower house election must be held by next summer, but before
then the electorate will vote this summer for half the seats in the
upper house, where the Liberal Democrats hold 143 of the 252 seats.
   Analysts question whether the opposition has much of a chance
given its lack of unity. The opposition includes the Socialist
Party (85 lower house seats), Buddhist-based Komeito (56 seats),
Democratic Socialists (29 seats), Marxist-Leninist Commmunists (27
seats) and a scattering of independents.
   But analysts agree that it is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
for Ms. Doi and the Socialists, who haven't tasted power since a
few months in the late 1940s.
   In 1986, Ms. Doi became the first woman to head a political
party in Japan. Her predecessor resigned over the Socialists'
election defeat to the popular former Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone.
   Ms. Doi is one of only 27 women against 737 men in both houses,
and her voice often is heard at public events. She also appears on
television shows, not only to debate politics but to take part in
game programs. She is from Kobe, where her father was a doctor.
   She is a regular in the parliamentarians' annual singing
contest, performing the Japanese version of ``My Way,'' and she
claims expertise in pachinko, the equivalent of Western pinball
generally associated with students and working class people.
   Analysts say Ms. Doi, a former professor of law at Doshisha
University in Kyoto, helped the Socialists dramatically improve
their dry image of a blue-collar party heavily dependent on labor
unions.
   Now the party has a wider range of support from women's
organizations, most of which had primarily supported the
Communists, as well as from environmental, civil rights and peace
groups.
   Among disagreements between opposition parties is defense. The
Socialists call for Japan to become a neutral and unarmed nation by
shifting the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty into more of a friendship
treaty with no military provisions. The two middle-of-the-road
parties, Komeito and Democratic Socialists, insist the security
treaty is indispensable.

   A predawn fire in the legislative palace
blazed out of control for more than an hour today, killing a
security guard and heavily damaging the massive structure,
officials said.
   A Red Cross spokeswoman, Leticia Calderon, identified the victim
as Miguel Soriano, 33, who suffocated from noxious fumes.
   Another guard, Juan Arias, was treated for smoke inhalation at
nearby Balbuena Hospital. Doctors said his condition is not serious.
   Tall plumes of dark smoke rose from the marble-faced structure
hours after the fire broke out, and television showed that
firefighters were still on the scene. Fire officials said they
suspect a short circuit caused the blaze.
   The state news agency, Notimex, quoted Fire Chief Ignacio Ponce
de Leon as saying the fire damaged at least 40 percent of the
palace, called San Lazaro.
   The blaze began about 3:00 a.m., and it took more than 160
firefighters over an hour to bring the blaze under control, he told
Notimex.
   The fire destroyed the huge central chamber where Congress meets
in joint session for major official events such as the president's
annual state of the union address, news reports said. The palace
was opened in 1981.

   Britain expelled three South African diplomats
today because of their country's reputed role in a plot to sell
arms to Northern Ireland extremists in exchange for British-made
missile parts.
   The Foreign Office said Undersecretary Patrick Wright summoned
South African Ambassador Rae Killen and told him the three must
leave the country within a week.
   ``We noted their expression of regret,'' a statement quoted
Wright as telling Killen. ``However, the South African government
should be under no illusions about the grave concern with which Her
Majesty's government viewed the involvement by South African
officials in this affair.
   ``Because of the gravity of this affair, Her Majesty's
government has decided that the South African government should be
requested to withdraw three members of the South African Embassy,''
the statement said.
   The move came two weeks after authorities in Paris arrested a
South African diplomat, an American arms dealer and three members
of an extreme Protestant organization in Northern Ireland.
   The Northern Irelanders allegedly were handing over parts of a
Blowpipe, a sophisticated shoulder-fired, anti-aircraft missile
manufactured in Belfast.
   The British government expressed grave concern over allegations
the South Africans were supplying weapons to the Protestants in
exchange for the missile parts.
   The South African, identified by French sources as Daniel Storm,
was released after he claimed diplomatic immunity. A week later,
the French government expelled three South African officials
implicated in the affair.
   The Foreign Office spokesman said the three who were ``requested
to withdraw'' are First Secretary for Information Jan H.P.
Castelyn, Counselor Jonathan Fourie, and Staff Sgt. Mark Brunner,
who works for the defense attache's office. The statement contained
no hint that they were involved in the alleged plot.
   During the 15-minute meeting, Wright said, ``we had considered
carefully the South African response,'' particularly a statement by
Gen. Magnus Malan, South Africa's defense minister, to his
country's Parliment on May 3.
   At that time, Malan said an official inquiry into the affair had
shown that Storm had acted without government approval. He said he
regretted the embarrassment caused to the British, French and Irish
governments and would act to ensure it would not happen again.
   But he also acknowledged on April 24 that South Africa sometimes
uses ``unconventional methods'' to get around an international arms
embargo against his country.
   The Irish government, which has no diplomatic relations with
Pretoria, delivered a formal protest to South Africa.
   According to the Foreign Office statement, Wright noted that
South Africa is under a United Nations arms embargo and pointed to
``the security situation in Northern Ireland where the lives of
innocent people are at risk.''
   He also warned the South Africans that ``any retaliation would
be entirely unjustified.''
   The Roman Catholic Irish Republican Army is fighting to push the
British out of Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland, join it with
the Republic of Ireland and set up an all-Ireland socialist state.
Protestant radicals are fighting the IRA effort.
   The three Irishmen and one American, Douglas Bernhart, arrested
with Storm were being held on gun-running and conspiracy charges.
   On April 25, federal prosecutors in Bern, Switzerland, opened an
inquiry into possible Swiss connections into the affair, saying
Bernhart had an office in Geneva.
   In Belfast, security sources said one of the three arrested was
a warrants officer in the Territorial Army, a volunteer reserve
force. As a non-commissioned officer, Samuel Quinn, 42, was thought
to have instructed Territorial Army officers in the use of the
Blowpipe.
   The other Protestants were not named.

   Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski
today told 1,500 Communist Party delegates vying for election that
prospects for improving the economy are limited but ``we cannot and
we do not give up.''
   Opening the last day of a two-day conference to choose
candidates and adopt a platform for new, partially democratic
elections June 4, Rakowski urged a realistic, rather than a
pessimistic, outlook on the economy.
   ``I don't want to prove to anybody that it is good in Poland. I
only want to disagree with the spreading opinion that there is not
only stagnation but also a constant decline,'' he said.
   In its first competition with independent candidates, the party
wants to present itself as champion of economic and political
reforms.
   Rakowski blamed part of Poland's problems _ which include acute
shortages of housing, consumer goods and commodities _ on the rapid
population growth from 35.7 million in 1980 to 37.8 million last
year.
   President Bush, who last month announced a package of economic
aid to Poland, will visit Warsaw in the first half of July at the
invitation of Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, the official
news service announced today.
   Bush gave the aid in recognition of the restoration of legal
status to the independent Solidarity trade union and the scheduling
of the June elections.
   The exact date for the Bush visit was not announced in the
one-sentence dispatch by the state's PAP news service.
   At a news conference later today, party spokesman Jan Bysztyga
said the party will not announce its candidates until May 10.
Opposition candidates nominated by the Solidarity Citizens'
Committee already have been chosen.
   Also today, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and Poland's Roman
Catholic Primate, Cardinal Jozef Glemp, met privately for the first
time in nearly two years to discuss ``what's going on in the
country,'' Walesa said.
   He and Glemp refused to discuss details.
   Walesa said he thanked the church for helping Solidarity survive
during seven years as a banned organization.
   The church helped set up the talks between the government and
the opposition that concluded April 5 with a historic package of
political, union and economic freedoms, including legalizing
Solidarity.
   Under the agreement, the opposition will vie for 161 seats, or
35 percent of the existing unicameral parliament called the Sejm.
   Elections will be totally democratic for a new 100-member Senate
that will be the East bloc's first freely elected parliament
chamber.
   The two houses will elect the president, a new office.
   Jaruzelski is expected to win owing to the party's guaranteed
majority.

   Blasting prosecutors and vowing to ``fight
hard, for as long as it takes,'' Oliver North says his conviction
on three felonies in the Iran-Contra affair will eventually be
overturned.
   The first person to go on trial in the scandal that rocked the
last two years of the Reagan administration, North lost his
$23,100-a-year Marine pension as soon as the jury delivered its
verdict Thursday.
   Ex-President Reagan, who successfully resisted a defense
subpoena to testify at the trial, declined to comment after the man
he once called a national hero was found guilty.
   North was acquitted of nine of the 12 criminal charges against
him and prosecutor John Keker appeared less than satisfied with the
decision.
   Still, Keker said, ``Colonel North has been convicted of three
very serious charges. The jury has spoken.'' North called it ``a
partial vindication.''
   North, to be sentenced June 23 by U.S. District Judge Gerhard A.
Gesell, faces a maximum of 10 years in prison and $750,000 in
fines. As a first-time offender with an exemplary 20-year military
career, North almost certainly will get penalties far less severe
than that. Court appeals could take years.
   The National Security Council's former ``action officer'' on
Central America counterattacked less than two hours after walking
out of the federal courthouse. He defiantly criticized the cost of
pursuing him through the legal system and suggested the prosecution
had overstepped the bounds of fairness.
   ``After more than two and a half years and over $40 million of
our taxpayers' money spent on investigations, congressional
inquisitions and now a special prosecutor who has likened me to
Adolf Hitler, we now face many months and perhaps years of fighting
the remaining charges,'' North said, reading from a statement.
   ``As a Marine, I was taught to fight and fight hard, for as long
as it takes to prevail,'' he added. ``We will continue this battle
and with the support and prayers of the American people, we will be
fully vindicated.''
   In closing arguments last month, Keker said North and his former
boss, national security adviser Robert McFarlane, ``are following
Adolf Hitler's old strategy: The victor will never be asked if he
told the truth.''
   North got an endorsement of sorts from one of the jurors,
65-year-old Earl Williams, who served in Patton's 3rd Army in World
War II.
   ``He made some mistakes, you know, but I don't think he should
go to jail for it ... a hero like he was,'' Williams told CBS News
following deliberations that totaled 64 hours over 12 days.
   Williams had an apparent change of heart overnight, however. In
an interview today on ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' he said of
North: ``Well, personally, I feel that if he's guilty he should go
to jail. Which he is, so, you know ....''
   North won't get his military pension back unless his conviction
for altering and shredding sensitive NSC documents is overturned on
appeal.
   ``Once the conviction goes into effect, whatever time that is,
he loses his retired pay,'' said Pentagon spokeswoman Linda
Dumoulin. The conviction is legally effective as soon as the
secretary of the Navy is formally notified and the paperwork
completed.
   For North, intensely proud of his Marine career, the pain of
that punishment is likely to be more in its symbolism than its
financial cost. Conservative groups have been willing to pay him as
much as $20,000 in speaking fees for a single appearance, and just
a few hours after his conviction, two more speaking engagements
were announced in Cleveland for May 11.
   In seeking to overturn the convictions, North's lawyers will
first file post-trial motions with Gesell on the question of
whether North's case was tainted by his and other witnesses'
nationally televised immunized congressional testimony in 1987.
That could mean delving further into the knowledge of jurors, the
grand jurors who indicted North and prosecutors in the office of
independent counsel Lawrence Walsh. Gesell set a deadline of 10
days for the defense to announce its intentions.
   North was found innocent of charges that focused on lying and
obstructing Congress in 1985 and 1986 by denying he was assisting
the Contras. At the time his superiors had passed along an order
from Reagan to see to the needs of the rebels, and to do so
secretly during a congressional ban on military aid, according to
trial testimony.
   But North was found guilty of aiding and abetting an obstruction
of Congress as well as shredding and altering documents in November
1986, crimes that occurred after the Iran arms sales had been
publicly disclosed. North also was found guilty of accepting a
$13,800 home security system in mid-1986 from Iran-Contra
co-defendant Richard Secord, whom North had enlisted to run arms to
the Contras.
   President Bush used the occasion of the verdict to speak out on
a major question raised by evidence in the trial _ whether as vice
president he helped circumvent the ban on U.S. aid to the Contras.
   Bush, who previously had declined to comment because of the
ongoing trial proceedings, declared Thursday that he never told
Honduras' president that U.S. aid would be linked to that country's
support for the Nicaraguan rebels.
   Bush declared firmly that there was no deal, ``no quid pro quo.''
   Some conservatives, meanwhile, clamored for a presidential
pardon of North. Richard A. Viguerie, chairman of the United
Conservative Union, declared that ``Oliver North deserves a medal,
not a prison sentence.''
   But on Capitol Hill, conservative Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H.,
opposed a pardon, saying, ``The man was indicted and the jury
decided that the facts upheld three of the indictments. It's
obviously a tragedy for him and his family. But no one is above the
law.''

   Moroccan authorities have seized the March issue
of Kalima, a monthly magazine that has reported on sensitive issues
in the North African country, an anti-censorship organization said
Friday.
   The issue contained stories on the Moroccan press, according to
the organization, Article 19 International Center on Censorship. It
did not say what the government found offensive.
   The London-based organization, which takes its name from an
article in the United Nations charter, said it was the fourth time
the government has interfered with Kalima.
   It said editions with articles on abortion and male prostitution
have been seized, and that in November the government suspended
circulation of the magazine for one week.
   Kalima has a circulation of 10,000 and is the only Moroccan
magazine that must submit each issue to the Interior Ministry
before publication, the organization said.

   Another 234 Vietnamese boat people sailed into
Hong Kong on Friday aboard six boats, bringing to more than 5,600
the number who arrived in this British colony this year, officials
said.
   More than 1,400 Vietnamese arrived this month, forcing the
government to set up tents at a detention center because of a lack
of accommodations, the officials said.
   Hong Kong Secretary for Security Geoffrey Barnes said he
believed Hanoi was allowing the exodus to achieve ``benefits'' at
the international conference on Indochinese refugees in Geneva next
month.
   Barnes said he expects 11,000 Vietnamese boat people to arrive
in the colony in the coming months.
   There are more than 30,000 Vietnamese boat people in Hong Kong.
More than half arrived after the Hong Kong government introduced a
tough policy in June under which the Vietnamese are regarded as
illegal immigrants unless they can prove they fled Vietnam because
of persecution.
   In March, 75 Vietnamese from the colony returned voluntarily to
Vietnam in the first large-scale repatriation. Vietnam has so far
refused to consider forcible repatriation of Vietnamese from this
territory.

<HEAD>Gunners Shell Christian Enclave; New Dispute Over Cease-Fire Reported</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA ABU-NASR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Syrian and Druse gunners shelled the
coast of Lebanon's Christian enclave today, and sources said there
was a new dispute on how to enforce a cease-fire called by the Arab
League.
   Beirut newspapers said Kuwaiti army Brig. Gen. Ali Al-Momen had
been appointed commander of a 321-man observer force drawn from six
Arab nations to monitor the fraying truce.
   Intermittent shellfire struck the shoreline between the ports of
Jounieh and Byblos north of Beirut, keeping the only escape routes
closed for 1 million Christians in the beleaguered enclave, police
said.
   Mortar salvos also were lobbed from positions around
Syrian-policed Moslem west Beirut into the residential districts of
Hazmieh and Ein Rummaneh in the city's Christian sector, police
said.
   They said the mostly Christian units of the army commander, Gen.
Michel Aoun, who has pledged to respect the cease-fire proclaimed
one week ago, did not return fire.
   There were no casualties reported from the new hostilities in
the latest round of Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war. The violence
has killed 278 people and wounded 1,010 since March 8.
   Two Arab League envoys _ Lakhdar Ibrahimi, an Algerian, and
Abdel-Aziz Al-Jassem, Kuwait's ambasssador to Syria _ left Lebanon
on Thursday after two days of talks with Moslem and Christian
leaders to consolidate the cease-fire.
   They said they would return late next week to work out
arrangements for deploying an Arab observer force in Lebanon.
   But chances of an early deployment of the force appeared dim.
   Moslem sources, requesting anonymity, said the Syrian-Druse
alliance served notice it would not stop shelling Christian ports
before the force arrived.
   The sources said the alliance also has demanded the force block
ships carrying Iraqi arms supplies to Aoun from reaching the
Christian enclave.
   Iraq is Syria's main Arab rival. It expressed support for Aoun
when he declared his ``war of liberation'' against Syria, which has
40,000 troops stationed in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League
peacekeeping mandate.
   Aoun has denied receiving weapons from Iraq.
   ``We're going to have a half truce,'' said the independent
Beirut daily An-Nahar.
   The current confrontation broke out two days after Auon imposed
a blockade on illegal militia-run ports. Militiamen of Druse
warlord Walid Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party retaliated by
shelling the Christian enclave's shoreline.
   The Syrians later joined the bombardment and sealed off land
exits of the 310-square-mile enclave.

   Teachers at state-run Makerere University
agreed to return to work Monday after the government promised to
look into their complaints.
   The teachers called off a three-day strike after meeting with
top officials from the ministries of education and finance.
   A member of the Makerere University Academic Staff Association
who attended the meeting said the officials had agreed to create a
committee to look into the teachers' complaints and submit its
findings by May 17.
   The committee will examine ways to improve wages,
accommodations, medical facilities, education for teachers'
children and meals, he said.
   A full professor at Makerere earns the equivalent of $35 a
month. Lecturers are paid about $300 a year.
   There are about 7,000 students at the Kampala school. Uganda's
only other institution of higher learning is the Islamic University
in Mbale that has about 500 Moslem students.

   A small plane carrying sugar plantation

people aboard, it was reported Friday.
   State aviation experts were flown to the town of Triangle to
investigate the cause of Thursday night's crash.
   The seven passengers were senior personnel of Triangle Ltd., a
multimillion- dollar company that grows and refines sugar cane, a
company spokesman said.
   They were traveling from the annual Zimbabwe International Trade
Fair in Bulawayo to Buffalo Range airport near Triangle, 200 miles
to the southeast, when the plane crashed, acting managing director
Colin Saunders told the Zimbabwe Inter-African News Agency.
   A search party found the bodies, the managing director said.
Company sources said all aboard were Zimbabweans.

   Student demonstrators in New York ended 11 days of protests
today and calm was restored at the University of Massachusetts,
where 102 protesters have been arrested in the past two weeks.
   Police on Thursday used wheelchairs to arrest 32 Massachusetts
students after a 20-hour occupation of a dean's office in a science
building to protest Defense Department-funded research at the
25,000-student campus.
   Three more students were taken into custody outside, including
two who allegedly tried to block buses carrying protesters to the
football stadium. The arrests brought the two-week total at the
Amherst campus to 102.
   At the City University of New York, students who had occupied
buildings on several campuses accepted an amnesty offer and ended
their protests this morning, although demonstrations at two
colleges lingered.
   ``I think it's over,'' said CUNY spokeswoman Rita Rodin.
   The protests over proposed tuition increases and budget cuts
began 11 days ago and spread to several campuses of the state-run
university system.
   Elsewhere, teaching and research assistants at the University of
California-Berkeley ended a two-day strike on Thursday, claiming
they had won overwhelming support from students.
   In Atlanta, a group hoping to pressure Mercer University
trustees to keep open the school's College of Arts and Sciences
ended a 24-hour ``read-in'' Thursday and launched a daylong prayer
vigil. Trustees voted to close the college June 30, 1990.
   In Middlebury, Vt., several hundred students protested tuition
increases at Middlebury College, but the school's president said
the demonstration was unlikely to stop plans to increase tuition to
$19,000 a year, from $17,000 this year.
   Students carried placards and chanted slogans on Thursday to
protest the increase, which includes tuition, room and board.
   ``This is not just a Middlebury College problem,'' said David
Milner, a junior and one of the protest organizers. He said
students at other private schools are facing average 7 percent
increases.
   Students at the Amherst campus of the University of
Massachusetts chanted ``Money for tuition, not ammunition,'' and
demanded the university halt its nearly $12 million worth of
unclassified research for the Defense Department.
   Shortly before noon, campus police used wheelchairs to wheel the
protesters out of a suite of offices belonging to Samuel F. Conti,
vice chancellor of research and dean of the graduate school.
   The students, including some from nearby Hampshire College and
the University of Massachusetts in Boston, were carried to a bus
surrounded by more than 100 state, local and campus police in riot
gear and about 200 cheering students.
   The 35 people arrested were taken to locker rooms at the
football stadium for booking and arraignment on trespassing and
other charges.
   The 20-hour takeover was the third occupation in two weeks on
the 25,000-student campus.
   In New York, CUNY Chancellor Joseph S. Murphy said college
presidents agreed not to punish demonstrators provided ``they had
not been involved in the destruction of property or in causing
injury to others.''
   Hunter College students said they were happy with the amnesty
offer and with the formation of a committee of students, faculty,
administration and staff that would advise the president on budget
matters.
   More than 100 students at Hunter vacated three floors of a
building this morning, expressing satisfaction with an agreement
reached during the early-morning hours with President Paul LeClerc.
   ``This struggle is not over,'' said student spokeswoman Vivian
Brady. ``We won a major battle in stopping the tuition raise, but
there are still many cuts in the budget to be regained.''
   Students left the president's offices at Medgar Evers College in
Brooklyn, according to Rodin. Protesters were planning to leave
buildings this afternoon at John Jay College of Criminal Justice at
the Borough of Manhattan Community College, she said.
   The demonstrations began April 24 when a group of students
occupied a building at City College in Harlem to protest threatened
$200-a-year tuition increases and staff and faculty reductions
because of state budget cuts.
   The protests and sit-ins quickly spread to seven of the 20
campuses in the system. Gov. Mario Cuomo vetoed tuition hikes
earlier this week but did not boost funding, and school officials
warn as many as 350 positions could be cut.
   In California, the Association of Graduate Student Employees at
Berkeley said 70 percent of 410 classes were canceled because of
the strike by nearly all of the 3,200 teaching and research
assistants; 18 percent were less than half full and only 12 percent
had normal attendance, according to the survey.
   The results were similar to those reported by the association
Wednesday, when the strike began with the aim of gaining national
attention for a burgeoning movement on the country's campuses _
recognition of assistants as employees.
   University officials, however, said the effort was mostly
symbolic.

   Top U.S. officials had highly reliable
intelligence throughout 1986 about the exorbitant prices Oliver
North and Richard Secord were charging for arms sold to Iran,
according to a document released today as the result of a lawsuit
filed by 10 news organizations.
   The newly declassified three-page stipulation summarizing the
intelligence was released in censored form under an agreement
reached between the Justice Department and The Associated Press
along with nine other news organizations.
   ``The intelligence ... provides information regarding the
pricing and delivery of missiles and military material sold to Iran
and the release of American hostages held in Lebanon,'' says the
stipulation.
   Still-classified reports on the intelligence were gathered by
``various methods of surveillance'' and ``show individuals
involved, including General Secord,'' the stipulation adds. ``The
reports contained information about pricing of this material and
those recipients of the reports at the Central Intelligence Agency,
National Security Council, and Department of Defense who knew the
actual cost of this material to the DOD could have known the
Iranians were being significantly overcharged.''
   North enlisted Secord to run arms to the Contras and also had
the former Air Force major general turned businessman assist arms
shipments to Iran for the Reagan administration.
   North and Secord diverted profits from the Iran arms sales into
bank accounts controlled by Secord and some of the diverted money
was funneled to the Contras for their fight to oust the Sandinista
government in Nicaragua.
   The intelligence reports on which the stipulation is based
``generally range from two to several pages and are in
chronological order commencing on September 1985 and ending in
December 1986,'' the newly released document says.
   The intelligence reports were sent to 17 people, the stipulation
says, including Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, CIA
director William Casey and national security advisers Robert
McFarlane and John Poindexter.
   The news organizations went to court April 21 seeking disclosure
of the stipulation, which was given to the North jury during
deliberations, but not released to the public.
   The stipulation underscores testimony at North's trial that top
administration officials were given information about the prices of
weapons being sold to Iran. Marine Lt. Col. Robert Earl testified
that in computing a mark-up on one proposed shipment in the spring
of 1986, he multiplied the cost of military spare parts by a factor
of 3.7. Earl was an aide to North on the National Security Council.
   The National Security Agency had insisted that the uncensored
version of the stipulation submitted to the North jury be kept out
of the public record. The highly secretive agency gathers
intelligence through a worldwide communications network.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell rejected the news media's
motion to release the stipulation, saying the document was
classified. Today, Gesell signed an order authorizing the Justice
Department to release the censored version.
   The sanitized version of the stipulation ``deletes solely
information that would disclose methods of intelligence
collection,'' according to a joint court filing by lawyers for the
news organizations and the Justice Department. The deleted
information also includes data ``as to the precise time at which
information was received.''
   ``It does not delete the names or titles of any government
officials who received the information and whose names already have
been released in the public record,'' said the court filing.
   North's lawyers referred to the stipulation in closing arguments
at his trial to show that Casey and Poindexter knew that Hawk
missiles were aboard a November 1985 shipment from Israel to Iran
assisted by the CIA. North was found guilty Thursday of aiding and
abetting the preparation of a false chronology for Congress stating
that no one in the government knew until January 1986 that Hawk
missiles were aboard the November 1985 shipment. The conviction
also covers shredding of documents in connection with the
chronology. North's defense on the charge was that Casey and
Poindexter knew at the time what was in the shipment, but arranged
to cover up that fact from Congress.
   The other media organizations involved were Cable News Network
Inc.; Capital Cities-ABC Inc.; CBS Inc.; Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc.;
National Broadcasting Co. Inc.; National Public Radio; The New York
Times Co.; the Times Mirror Co.; and The Washington Post.

<TEXT>
   China's leaders responded to massive
pro-democracy student demonstrations with conciliatory speeches
acknowledging protesters' grievances and promising further
dialogue, state media reported Friday.
   Exhausted university students began returning to classrooms
Friday after staging several marches during a two-week school
boycott, and campus activists plotted their next steps for the
fledgling democracy movement.
   Official newspapers prominently displayed a speech by Communist
Party chief Zhao Ziyang that he delivered Thursday, when tens of
thousands of students occupied Tiananmen Square to demand freedom
and honest government.
   Zhao called for talks with the students, although he did not
promise any meetings with representatives of the pro-democracy
movement. Premier Li Peng, in a speech Friday, also said ``the
dialogue between the government and the students will continue.''
He did not elaborate.
   While Li expressed disapproval of ``some actions of some
students,'' he said many of their demands were in line with
government aims, such as bringing an end to corruption, the
official Xinhua News Agency reported.
   Zhao said the protesters ``absolutely don't want to oppose our
basic system, but demand that we fix maladies in our work.''
   He also seemed to tone down earlier official claims that
students were being manipulated by people and wanted to see the
country in turmoil. He said such people were unavoidable but few in
number and said vigilance against them must be maintained. ``I
think the vast majority of students understand this.''
   One student leader at Beijing Normal College acknowledged the
softening of the authorities' attitude, but claimed Zhao was taking
a page from traditional Chinese shadow boxing by ``turning
flexibility into strength.''
   The state media Friday also gave their fullest accounts yet of
any student protest since the pro-democracy movement began April
15. Several newspapers quoted onlookers as saying they supported
the marchers. They used stories filed by their reporters instead of
Xinhua, which has provided only skimpy and understated coverage of
the student movement.
   Press freedom has been a major demand pushed by the students,
and among the demonstrators Thursday were scores of journalists who
voiced support for a media free from official control.
   After a nearly two-week boycott by students at Beijing
universities, students returned to class Friday. Others, weary from
successive marches, said they would wait until next week.
   A poster put up by the new student union at People's University
said, ``Our efforts of half a month or not wasted. Our class
boycott had definite results. Returning to class does not mean we
have ceased our diligence for democracy and for a dialogue'' with
the government.
   The union said it chose to end the boycott ``to seek a form of
dialogue that is reasonable and practicle and acceptable to both
sides.''
   Xinhua reported more than half the capital's university students
returned to class Friday.
   Opposition to ending the boycott surfaced at Beijing University,
where activists hesitated to order students back to class and a few
wall posters appeared urging the strike to continue.
   ``I think we should boycott a while longer,'' said an economics
student. ``If we go back to class now then there's no pressure on
the government and it won't recognize our independent union.''
   But there were indications democracy movement leaders were
turning to new activities in their young campaign. At People's
University, the new student group put up a poster requesting the
return of bullhorns issued for the demonstrations.
   Hard at work in a fourth-floor Beijing Normal dormitory room was
a student activist reviewing possible new directions for the
movement to take such as setting up an independent newspaper,
forming ``culture circles'' to hear prominent speakers, conducting
surveys and studying the Chinese constitution.
   ``We still have plenty of work to do,'' he said.
   The student movement began after the death April 15 of Hu
Yaobang, a reformer who lost his job as party chairman in 1987 when
he failed to suppress pro-democracy student demonstrations.
   About 100,000 people, mostly students, occupied Tiananmen Square
on Thursday after a march through the capital's streets to mark the
70th anniversary of China's first student movement and give
momentum to the current wave of pro-democracy activity.
   Students participating in that protest and a similar
demonstration a week earlier were eagerly supported by tens of
thousands of workers who cheered the marchers and donated money to
the cause.

   President Bush has not discussed the question
of whether to pardon Oliver North, Bush's spokesman said today, a
day after the former White House aide was convicted on felony
counts in connection with the Iran-Contra case.
   ``He said `I haven't discussed it with anybody,''' White House
press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater told reporters, recounting the
president's reply when Fitzwater asked him about a pardon on
Thursday.
   Fitzwater refused any further comment on the North verdict or
trial documents that appeared to indicate Bush was involved in a
Reagan administration plan to make a quid pro quo arrangement with
Honduras in return for its assistance to the Contra rebels in
Nicaragua.
   Fitzwater said the appropriate congressional committees would be
briefed on confidential cables that described Bush's activities in
that regard.
   Bush said Thursday he never told Honduras' president that U.S.
aid would be linked to that country's support for the Nicaraguan
rebels. And he dared skeptics to prove him wrong.
   Confronting a pivotal Iran-Contra question head-on Thursday,
Bush declared firmly there was no deal, ``no quid pro quo.''
   Bush, who had refused to address the issue for weeks, did so
moments before a federal jury announced it had convicted former
White House aide Oliver North on three of 12 charges relating to
the arms-and-money affair.
   The president cited the ongoing North trial recently in refusing
to talk about suggestions he played an intermediary's role as vice
president in a purported Reagan administration plan to tie American
assistance to the willingness of Latin American countries to help
the Contras.
   But on Thursday he was eager to take the question.
   Speaking of a meeting he had with then-Honduran President
Roberto Suazo in early 1985, Bush said: ``The records of the
meeting demonstrate there was no quid pro quo.
   ``The word of the president of the United States _ George Bush _
is, there was no quid pro quo. No implication, no quid pro quo,
direct or indirect, from me to the president of Honduras on that
visit.
   ``And for those who suggest there was, the onus is on them. ...
Thank you for asking that question.''
   Neither Bush nor White House aides would say whether he might
grant North a pardon. Nor would the White House comment on the
verdict.
   Bush said on April 24 that he had not talked with anyone about
whether he would pardon North and said any suggestions about what
he would do were ``stupid'' and ''idiotic.'' In the past, he had
called North a hero and said he hoped the former Marine officer
would be acquitted.
   The question of Bush's role in a possible Reagan administration
deal with Honduras was raised in documents presented at the North
trial. The documents placed him at a meeting with Suazo in Honduras
at a time when internal Reagan administration memos suggested a
plan in which continuing U.S. aid to Latin American countries would
be linked to assistance for the rebels.
   The government ``admitted for purposes of this trial'' the facts
in a main document, the 42-page stipulation introduced at the
trial, although a State Department official subsquently said it
presented a distorted picture of U.S. policy and actions in 1985
and 1986. The U.S. government was barred from directly or
indirectly aiding the rebels during that time.
   The document never asserted that Bush discussed a quid pro quo
arrangement with Suazo. But it said he explained to the Hondurans
that they were to receive a great deal more U.S. economic and other
aid _ aid that the document said was part of a deal approved by
then-President Reagan.
   Bush complained that ``there has been much needless, mindless
speculation about my word of honor. And I've answered it now,
definitively.''
   Bush had said last week that he had had no discussions with
anyone about a possible pardon for North. On Thursday, deputy press
secretary Stephen Hart said only, ``We won't have any comment'' on
North's conviction.
   Last year, Bush called North a ``national hero'' but later
refined that to say he was alluding to North's record of heroism in
military combat.
   Bush said in the aftermath of the North trial, he would ``insist
that the congressional committees ... be briefed thoroughly on the
confidential cables'' describing the meeting with Suazo.
   White House press secretary Fitzwater said that Bush is willing
to have members of congressional committees briefed by State
Department officials regarding any questions they might have about
the Suazo meeting.
   He said Bush would not submit to questions from lawmakers,
although he reiterated that the White House position is to ``help
in any way we can.''

<TEXT>
   The state has approved a privately funded
historical marker to be erected near the site of the 1964 murders
of three civil rights workers whose deaths were depicted in the
movie ``Mississippi Burning.''
   Herb Anderson, program director at WKXI-AM, a black-oriented
station in Jackson, launched efforts in February to raise money for
the marker. The station so far has raised about $1,000.
   Elbert R. Hilliard, executive director of the state Department
of Archives and History, confirmed in a letter received by the
station Friday that the marker had been approved, but he said no
decision had been made on the location. The ideal spot would be
along a state highway, Hilliard said.
   Anderson said the marker may be located along Mississippi 21
near the earthen dam where the bodies of the three men were found.
   Archives officials have said that no state historical marker was
erected because public money has not been appropriated for such
markers since 1980. Hilliard had said that private groups may
purchase state historical markers for $925, but the department must
approve the marker and the text on them.
   ``It is certainly fitting that historic sites in Mississippi can
be designated with appropriate markers so that Mississippi's
citizens and out-of-state visitors can study and enjoy the
interesting heritage of our state,'' Hilliard said in his letter to
Anderson.
   Anderson began his fund-raising drive about the time
``Mississippi Burning'' was first shown in the state.
   The movie is a fictionalized account of the federal
investigation of the murders of Andrew Goodman, James Earl Chaney
and Michael Schwerner in Neshoba County in 1964. Their bodies were
found near the town of Philadelphia six weeks after their deaths on
June 21, 1964.

   President Bush and West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl today discussed by telephone the rift in NATO over
East-West negotiations on short-range missiles, but the United
States remains firmly opposed to such talks, Bush's spokesman said.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the phone
conversation, initiated by Kohl, lasted for about 20 minutes.
   He declined to characterize the substance of the conversation,
but said Bush has not changed his opposition to early talks with
the Soviets on eliminating battlefield nuclear weapons from Western
Europe.
   ``We still believe early talks would be a mistake,'' Fitzwater
said. ``Discussions that would lead to a ... de-nuclearization of
Europe would not be welcome.''
   Kohl, responding to public opinion in West Germany where the
presence of the American nuclear weapons is being strongly
challenged, has called for such talks with the Soviets.
   The issue threatens to disrupt a North Atlantic Treaty
Organization summit late this month.
   ``I want the NATO meeting to be a success,'' Bush said Thursday
after meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. ``And
one way you guarantee success is not to go out and fine-tune nuance
differences that may exist between various staunch allies.''
   Today, Fitzwater accused the Soviets of ``assiduously'' seeking
to drive a wedge among NATO allies over elimination of the
short-range missiles.
   He said Kohl called because ``he wanted to be sure he understood
President Bush's position.''
   Asked whether the United States and West Germany were any closer
to smoothing over their differences on the issue as a result of the
phone call between the two leaders, the spokesman said: ``I would
not characterize it as moving the situation one way or the other.''
   On Thursday, Bush had voiced the administration's willingness to
negotiate with other NATO allies on the dispute.
   But, he added, ``we're not going to go for any third zero (the
elimination of the short-range weapons) or getting SNF (another
term for the weapons) out of whack in terms of negotiations. So
let's get clear on that.''
   Asked today at what point the president might be willing to
enter into such negotiations, Fitzwater replied: ``It's impossible
to define that point.''
   Instead of curbing nuclear weapons, Bush said Thursday, NATO
should put its emphasis on trying to get the Soviet Union to reduce
its overwhelming superiority in conventional weapons.
   Resolving the NATO dispute should be done privately among
members of the 16-member alliance, Bush said.
   The disagreement has clouded an upcoming May 29-30 NATO summit
called to celebrate the alliance's 40th anniversary.
   Referring to his guest, Bush praised Mulroney for giving him
``constructive suggestions'' on the matter.
   The Canadian leader did not detail those suggestions, other to
say he told Bush: ``NATO was founded on two concepts: first,
solidarity; and secondly, the American leadership of the Western
alliance. And we have to stick together on all of these fundamental
issues. And we will.''
   Canada has suggested a compromise in which NATO would agree in
principle to talks with the Soviets on abolishing the short-range
nuclear weapons while talks to erase the Warsaw Pact's edge in
conventional weapons proceed.
   Bush said the United States had made some proposals to West
Germany and ``I expect we'll be hearing from them soon.''
   White House officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Bush was not referring to any new proposal to deal with the problem
posed by West Germany's demands.
   Instead, he was referring to a months-old U.S. proposal for an
overall approach for NATO's defense, the officials said.
   On other matters, Bush said his administration is in the final
stages of work on new clean-air legislation that will propose
tougher standards on industrial emissions that cause acid rain _ a
crucial issue in U.S.-Canadian relations.
   Mulroney said, ``I applaud the leadership the president is
giving to the environment, particularly to the question of acid
rain.''
   Bush also said he will meet ``in the next few days'' with his
science adviser, physicist D. Allan Bromley, about claims by
scientists that they have produced nuclear fusion at room
temperature. And he voiced ``enthusiastic backing'' to demands by
Chinese students who have staged huge pro-democracy demonstrations.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Changes in Way FBI Promotes Minority Agents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WENDY E. LANE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EL PASO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge today ordered changes in
the way the FBI promotes its minority agents, calling the present
promotional method ``unsystematic and excessively subjective.''
   The order by U.S. District Judge Lucius Bunton stops the FBI
from arbitrarily deciding whom to promote. Bunton called the
bureau's system, under which supervisors may disregard the
recommendation of a career review board, an ``anathema to nearly
every reform advanced by the bureau.''
   He ordered the agency ``to improve the fairness and
reviewability'' of its promotional process.
   Last September, following a two-week, non-jury trial, Bunton had
ruled that the FBI had discriminated against Hispanic agents in
promotions, discipline and assignments. It was a major
embarrassment for the FBI, which investigates civil rights
violations.
   In February and March, Bunton heard arguments from both sides on
how the FBI should change and whether Hispanic agents should be
compensated.
   Hispanic agents had asked for back pay, but Bunton declined to
order any monetary damages in today's ruling. However, he ordered
the appointment of a three-member panel to examine on an individual
basis the plaintiff agents' request for promotions they claim they
have been denied as a result of discrimination.
   Bunton ordered that original plaintiff Bernardo M. ``Mat'' Perez
be promoted to the next job level in the bureau within 45 days and
that the bureau must ``make available to Perez responsibilities
commensurate with his experience and training.''
   Also, FBI Director Williams S. Sessions must report to the court
every 90 days regarding promotional decisions about Perez until he
becomes a special agent in charge or attains a similar position of
responsibility.
   Bunton praised the efforts made by the FBI since his initial
ruling in September.
   ``The bureau has taken significant steps since the date of the
trial to correct the disparate conditions of employment,'' Bunton
said in the opinion. But he stressed that reforms made thus far do
not go far enough.
   Officials have said Bunton's decision could have a ripple effect
on how other U.S. law enforcement agencies award promotions and
hand out assignments. Hispanic agents of the U.S. Border Patrol and
Customs Service have discussed filing suits similar to the FBI case.
   The class-action lawsuit was filed in January 1987 by Perez,
then the No. 2 agent in El Paso and the FBI's highest-ranking
Hispanic agent. Eventually, 310 of the FBI's approximately 400
Hispanic agents joined Perez in the suit. The FBI has about 9,000
agents.

<TEXT>
   Cracks appeared Friday in China's tightly
controlled media as newspapers gave unprecedented and even
sympathetic coverage to a huge student demonstration for democracy
and freedom.
   The development was significant because one of the main student
demands has been for a free press. Marches in the last three weeks
had received scant attention by the state-run media.
   About 300 journalists also joined Thursday's march of thousands,
adding their voice to the growing call for a freer and more
democratic China. ``Our mouths cannot say what we want to,'' read
one of their banners.
   Still, it was uncertain whether Friday's reporting on the march
would filter into other areas, such as corruption, mismanagement
and the incompetence of bureaucrats.
   Major newspapers used stories from their own journalists, a
change from the protest of April 27 when 150,000 students and their
supporters also marched to Tiananmen. The next day all of the
papers used a report from the official Xinhua News Agency, China's
most conservative media outlet.
   Unlike previous reports, several newspapers quoted bystanders as
saying they supported the march.
   The Science and Technology Daily quoted an old woman with tears
coming down her face as saying the students were speaking on behalf
of the people.
   The quote was an important one because in China the ruling
Communist Party is supposed to speak for the people.
   The article also used quotes to challenge the Xinhua report
which said only 20,000 students from 30 schools took part in the
march.
   ``More than 100,000 must be here,'' one person told the
newspaper.
   ``There must be more than 70 schools,'' said another.
   Science and Technology, a paper for intellectuals, has been at
the forefront of reporting about the movement. But it hasn't been
easy.
   Its April 23 edition, devoted to a demonstration during which
tens of thousands of students spent the night at Tiananmen Square,
came out only after its reporters threatened to quit. Ultimately,
they had to deliver the paper themselves.
   Friday's Xinhua story didn't include veiled criticism of the
movement.
   The report also mentioned the protest put on by 300 journalists,
saying simply that ``more than 200 young reporters also
demonstrated.''
   The People's Daily implicitly acknowledged the widespread public
support for the marchers, saying ``Tens of thousands of onlookers
stood by and many of them actively donated drinks and food.''
   The paper also reported that after the protesters left Tiananmen
Square some passed by its offices where they ``yelled slogans.''
   The paper, the organ of the Communist Party, has been subject to
heavy criticism by the students because it published an editorial
April 26, accusing them of trying to overthrow the state.
   The China Youth News, a relatively liberal paper, praised the
students for conducting an orderly march.
   It reported a large group of students ``are not satisfied'' with
talks held between the government and the students. However, the
article did not explain that students want the government to
conduct talks with their independent student association and not
with officially-appointed student representatives.
   It also said protests occurred in at least 11 other cities.
   The Legal Daily reported that one protest, in Xian, was actually
legal. It said the Northwest Polytechnical Institute had applied
for permission to demonstrate on May 4, the 70th anniversary of
China's first student movement, and the Public Security Bureau had
agreed.
   The Chinese constitution guarantees the right to demonstrate but
most cities have laws saying demonstrators must apply for a permit.
Technically, all of the protests in Beijing have been illegal
because students did not apply for permits.
   A senior editor at one major newspaper said the reports Friday
came out because of the pressure many journalists put on their
newspapers to publish.
   ``But behind this there is no move to change the structure of
the media in China. We are still owned and run by the state,'' she
said. ``Until that changes, I see no possibility for real
progress.''

<TEXT>
   The government said Friday it had
advance warning that Moslem guerrillas would attack Jalalabad,
which the insurgents predicted would fall in days but instead has
been under bloody siege for two months.
   Estimates of total casualties range from 7,000 to more than
12,500.
   Najmuddin Kawyani, a member of the Communist Party Politburo and
secretary of the Central Committee, said the government received a
tip about the offensive on March 5, two days before it began. He
did not say who gave the warning.
   ``No one could believe they were to launch an attack,'' Kawyani
said in an interview.
   The guerrillas, armed and supported by neighboring Pakistan and
the United States, predicted they would capture the eastern city
within three days. Kawyani said Friday they ``were enslaved by
their own slogans.''
   Guerrilla leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar has said he would pray in
Jalalabad at the close of Ramadan, the Moslem holy month just
ending.
   ``I have never seen such a big liar,'' Kawyani said. ``Perhaps
he didn't mean this year.''
   Commanders chose Jalalabad as the first major guerrilla target
after Soviet military forces completed their withdrawal Feb. 15,
ending more than nine years of participation in a civil war that
has cost more than 1 million lives.
   In the early days, the guerrillas captured army outposts around
the city, which is near the Khyber Pass, 75 miles east of Kabul and
45 miles from Pakistan. Then the conscript Afghan army rallied and
the campaign settled into stalemate.
   Insurgents launch rockets into the city and government forces
respond with artillery fire and bombing raids. Guerrilla units
advance on government positions and are driven back.
   ``The presence of the Soviets had ill effects,'' Kawyani said.
Afghan soldiers ``were relying on the Soviets to do it all. Now
their morale has changed considerably. You can't compare it with
three months ago.''
   Shortly after the Soviet withdrawal, the alliance of insurgent
groups formed an interim government in Pakistan. Kawyani said the
government was ``imaginary ... born in a dead body.''
   He said the civil war will continue for years unless a political
settlement is reached.
   President Najib has offered a coalition government and other
compromises, but all have been rejected by the guerrillas, who
began fighting after a communist coup in April 1978.
   Najib also has called for direct talks with the United States.
Washington has refused.
   Kawyani said Friday: ``We have one hope: that the Americans will
reverse the position. The past three months have shown ... that no
military solution is possible. Compromises are needed and we are
ready.''
   ``The Americans should accept this in principle. Later on, we
can talk about details.''

<HEAD>AP's Burma Correspondent Collects Award _ 26 Years Later</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sein Win, correspondent in Burma for The Associated
Press, collected a freedom of the press award Friday that he had
won 26 years ago.
   In a ceremony at the headquarters of the Paris-based
International Federation of Newspaper Publishers, Executive
Director Timothy Balding presented the AP's Rangoon correspondent
since 1969 with the Golden Pen of Freedom award.
   The annual award was established in 1961 to recognize
outstanding actions by an individual, group or institution to
advance freedom of the press.
   Sein Win, 68, won the award in 1962, when he was editor and
publisher of the Guardian, an independent English-language
newspaper in Rangoon. A military regime took over in Burma that
year and curbed the press.
   He has been jailed three times since the late 1950s for his
journalistic work, spending more than three years in jail,
including a one-month stint last year.
   Sein Win had been banned by his government from traveling abroad
until late last year when he received permission to attend the
annual meeting of the International Press Institute, which begins
next week in Berlin.
   Sein Win was elected to the institute's board in 1963. He
decided to stop in Paris on his way to Berlin to collect the award.
   ``I am very happy to receive this award after so many years,''
he said. ``I never thought I would receive permission to leave to
come get it.''
   Balding said it was fitting Win received the award after his
third stint in prison since he was named the recipient just after
his first term in jail.
   ``History has proved a wise choice was made,'' Balding said. ``I
hope the other winners stand up to the test of time as well as you
have.''
   Other winners include Hubert Beuve-Mery, the founder of the
French newspaper Le Monde; Jacobo Timerman, formerly of La Opinion
of Buenos Aires; and Anthony Heard of The Cape Times of South
Africa. This year's recipient is Sergei Grigoryants, publisher of
the Soviet magazine Glasnost.
   The federation's members include newspaper publishers'
associations from more than 30 countries, individual newspapers and
10 news agencies.

<HEAD>Pope Urges Catholics, Moslems to Ease Rivalry</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II, reflecting the
church's concern about the spread of Islamic fundamentalism in
Africa, urged Roman Catholics and Moslems on Friday to avoid
aggressive tactics in the battle for converts.
   In a speech to Malawi's Catholic bishops on the last full day of
his nine-day African tour, the pope raised the issue of the
church's tense relations with Moslems in this southern African
nation.
   ``What is required is mutual respect, as well as mutual
recognition of those things that we share in common,'' the pope
said.
   ``Both among Christians working for unity in obedience to Christ
and among believers of different religions, there is no place for
aggressive proselytism which disturbs and hurts, still less for the
use of unworthy methods,'' he added.
   The pope quoted from his speech to Moslems in Morocco in 1985:
   ``Christians and Moslems ... have badly understood each other,
and sometimes, in the past, have opposed and even exhausted each in
polemics and in wars. I believe that today God invites us to change
our old practices.''
   There are 2.5 million Catholics and 1 million Moslems in this
country of 8 million people. The rest of the population is made up
mostly of Anglicans, Protestants and animists.
   Islam has been growing rapidly in Malawi since the early 1970s.
Financed in part by Arab petrodollars, Moslems have built hundreds
of mosques across the country.
   Tensions grew after Moslem extremists set fire to several
Catholic churches in Malawi in 1983-84. Last August, several
Catholic youths and an elderly religion teacher were forcibly
circumcised in a suburb of Blantyre by Moslem fundamentalists,
church officials said.
   Some Moslem leaders here have said they are upset that the
pope's visit to Malawi came during the Moslem holy period of
Ramadan.
   The issue has significance for all of Africa. Church officials
have expressed concern about the spread of Moslem fundamentalism in
Nigeria, Sudan and other African countries. The Vatican in February
criticized the imposition of Islamic law on non-Moslems.
   Vatican officials say the competition for converts in Africa is
crucial.
   ``A big question is whether Africa will be a Christian or a
Moslem continent 25 years from now,'' said Vatican spokesman
Joaquin Navarro. ``The church cannot compete with the billions of
dollars that is financing Islam in Africa.''
   The pope also celebrated a morning Mass for more than 100,000
people at Blantyre's Kwacha (Freedom) Park, addressed at least
60,000 youths at the Kamuzu sports stadium and met with the
Catholic laity and representatives of other Christian faiths and
other religions.
   In his homily, he urged his flock to treat victims of AIDS as
``we would treat Christ himself.''
   Malawi has one of the highest rates of AIDS in Africa. According
to local health officials, as many as 20 percent of newborn
children are infected with the AIDS virus.
   At the stadium ceremony, school children wearing colorful
uniforms danced and sang to gospel-rock music as the pope arrived
in a glass-enclosed vehicle. Young boys dressed in grass skirts,
faces striped with red paint, danced a vigorous traditional dance
in a circle, screaming and stamping their feet.
   In his address to the lay people, he briefly expressed concern
for the first time on his trip about polygamy, which is common in
Africa.
   The pope travels Saturday to Lilongwe, Malawi's administrative
capital, to celebrate the final Mass of his voyage before returning
to Rome. He has visited Madagascar, Reunion and Zambia.

   Senate and House leaders say they expect
speedy completion of a compromise federal budget, now that both
chambers have passed mirror-image $1.2 trillion spending plans that
cause little political pain.
   Lawmakers on both sides of the Capitol approved fiscal 1990
budgets on Thursday, obediently consenting to proposals whose
foundations were laid in talks last month between congressional
leaders and Bush administration officials. With bipartisan amity
that has been glaringly absent in most budget debates, the Senate
adopted its plan 68-31, while the House signed off 263-157.
   ``We are pleased that the process is moving forward, and in a
quicker manner than in past years,'' White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said today. ``We will continue to work with the Congress
on the budget and we find these resolutions provide a very
optimistic prospect for reaching agreement.''
   Supporters said the budgets were the best available solutions to
the gridlock created by President Bush's ``no new taxes'' pledge
and Democratic reluctance to slash domestic programs. Yet they
conceded that their talks with the White House, which lasted about
as long as the biblical flood, had not yielded a perfect instrument.
   ``We didn't produce what Noah did,'' said Sen. Pete Domenici of
New Mexico, ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee.
``Some even think we barely produced a rowboat.''
   There are few significant differences between the two plans,
mainly because overall totals for revenues, deficit reduction and
defense, domestic and foreign aid spending were cemented in the
White House-congressional budget pact.
   House-Senate negotiators will have to settle relatively minor
differences in how the two chambers would distribute money among
education, science, criminal justice and other domestic programs.
   Congressional leaders have said their goal is to complete work
on a compromise budget by mid-May, which if accomplished would be
the earliest date of completion in 11 years. That bargaining should
begin next week.
   ``We should be able to resolve our differences quickly,'' said
House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif.
   Both houses' budgets claim to chop the $163 billion deficit
expected in fiscal 1989, which ends Sept. 30, to just over $99
billion next year. The plans have been criticized, however, for
relying largely on overly optimistic economic projections,
accounting gimmicks, and one-time savings, therefore doing little
to truly ease the government's long-range deficit ills.
   ``So the heck with the next generation, and whoopee for the next
election,'' said Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C. A Hollings amendment
that would have forced $32 billion in savings by holding most
spending at this year's levels was rejected, 82-18.
   Democratic and Republican leaders in both chambers flexed their
legislative muscles all day Thursday, quashing a slew of amendments
aimed at scuttling the budgets' taxing and spending formulas.
   Among the defeated proposals were a House amendment by the
Congressional Black Caucus that would have cut defense spending,
raised taxes on the wealthy and beefed up domestic programs, and a
motion by Sen. Herbert Kohl, D-Wis., that would have given the
Senate Budget Committee three days to produce deeper cuts.
   Under both the House and Senate proposals, federal receipts
would rise by $14.2 billion next year: $5.3 billion in unspecified
taxes, $5.7 billion in unnamed sales of federal assets, $2.7
billion in higher fees for government services, and $500 million by
boosting the Internal Revenue Service's ability to collect levies.
   Defense spending would reach $299.2 billion, about $4.7 billion
below the amount President Bush sought when he presented his
original budget proposal to Congress in February. Foreign aid would
receive $16.7 billion, enough to compensate for inflation over the
last year.
   On the domestic side, $2.3 billion in savings would come from
restraining Medicare payments to doctors and hospitals.
   Another $6 billion would come from reductions in other programs
the law says must be financed, including $1.1 billion in
yet-undecided reforms in the postal service and federal pension
programs. Critics have said some of these savings are of
questionable validity, such as $1.7 billion by moving the postal
service ``off-budget,'' and $477 million by claiming savings from
unused food stamps.
   Recipients of benefit programs, such as Social Security, would
receive their regularly scheduled annual cost-of-living increases.
   Programs for low-income people such as handicapped education and
employment for the elderly would receive high enough increases over
this year to cover the bite of inflation. Programs for children,
such as Head Start and child care, would be boosted by even more.
   Federal assistance would also be signficantly beefed up for
anti-drug programs, AIDS research and treatment, space, science,
aviation and the homeless.
   The budget resolution, once the two chambers complete a
compromise, is used as a guide by Congress when it writes its
spending and tax legislation.

<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thakin Soe, one of Burma's most prominent
communist leaders, has died at the age of 83, reports said Friday.
   Soe, who died Thursday following a long, undisclosed illness,
was the only surviving founding member of the Communist Party in
Burma, formed in 1937.
   He spent most of his life underground and for a time led the Red
Flag, or Trotskyite, branch of the party.
   He was captured by government forces in 1970 but released in a
1974 amnesty by the military government of former strongman Ne Win.
   Following student demonstrations, the military government of
Gen. Saw Maung allowed the formation of political parties and Soe
became the patron of the Unity and Peace Party, which hopes to
contest elections promised for next year.
   While a number of former communist guerrillas have come to the
government side or given up their struggle, the Burmese Communist
Party continues to battle the central government from bases along
the Chinese border. It has, however, been handicapped by the halt
of Chinese military aid and internal rifts.

   Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega said Friday that
Oliver North was the ``scapegoat'' for crimes committed by the U.S.
government and the person who really should be tried is former
President Reagan.
   North was convicted Thursday of three felony counts in
connection with the Iran-Contra case, which shadowed the last two
years of the Reagan administration.
   Ortega, on a swing through Western Europe, also told a news
conference that he hoped to improve relations with Washington.
   ``Oliver North has become the scapegoat for the crimes committed
by the government of the United States against Nicaragua,'' Ortega
said.
   ``But who was behind the actions of Oliver North? Who was the
boss of Oliver North? Who promoted the policy followed by Oliver
North? He's called Ronald Reagan. The person who ought to be
standing in the dock is Ronald Reagan, not Oliver North.
   Ortega also said President Bush ``seems clearly to have been
mixed up in these crimes.''
   He said his government had ``hopes and optimism'' that the
United States would change its policies toward Nicaragua.
Washington has maintained an economic embargo against the country
in addition to backing the Contras.
   Ortega is on a 10-nation tour to win economic aid for his
country's battered economy and to enlist Western European help in
persuading the United States to normalize relations with Nicaragua.
   He avoided questions about whether he had received promises of
aid from the countries he has visited thus far: Italy, Greece,
Norway, Sweden, Belgium, Spain and France.

<TEXT>
   A former Morton Thiokol Inc. purchasing
agent was sentenced today to a year and a day in federal prison for
taking kickbacks from defense subcontractors in return for business
with the aerospace company.
   U.S. District Judge David Sam sentenced John E. Ward on his
January 1988 guilty pleas to three counts as part of a plea bargain
with government attorneys. In exchange, prosecutors dropped 24
other counts.
   In imposing sentence, Sam said he had ``considered the extensive
cooperation'' Ward had given investigators, ``which I understand he
will continue to do in the future.''
   Following Ward's indictment by a federal grand jury in October
1987, 12 other individuals and nine companies were charged in the
scheme. All subsequently pleaded guilty and have been sentenced.
   Ward, 44, showed no emotion during sentencing and declined to
comment after the brief hearing.
   Sam sentenced Ward to concurrent 366-day terms on one count each
of mail fraud and accepting kickbacks. On the third count, filing a
false federal income tax return, Sam suspended sentence and gave
Ward five years' probation commencing with his release from prison.
   Ward also was fined $30,000 and ordered to pay $150 in victim
assessment fees. He was ordered to surrender to federal authorities
June 2.
   In indicting Ward in 1987, government attorneys alleged that for
more than three years, he had taken kickbacks from suppliers and
earned illegal profits by routing materials through three companies
he created and operated from his basement.
   Prosecutors said they could not determine how much money Ward
had received altogether, but that from one subcontractor alone he
had taken between $30,000 and $50,000.
   Neither Morton Thiokol nor any other current or former employees
of the company were charged in the kickback scheme.

<TEXT>
   Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Party on Friday
lost a parliamentary seat it has held for 38 years, in a sharp
rebuff the victorious Labor Party said showed that voters are weary
of her capitalist revolution.
   The blow came as Mrs. Thatcher marked her 10th anniversary in
power and declared she has transformed Britain.
   The socialist Labor Party claimed its stunning victory in the
Welsh Vale of Glamorgan shows voters are particularly wary of Mrs.
Thatcher's latest free-market crusade _ to overhaul the free
National Health Service that is a cornerstone of Britain's welfare
state.
   ``Mrs. Thatcher's days are numbered,'' declared John Smith, who
overturned the Conservatives' 6,251-vote majority to win by 6,028
votes.
   Smith swept through the largely rural district's main town, the
port of Barry, in an open-top bus thronged by cheering supportesr
celebrating the huge 12{ percent swing against the government.
   Mrs. Thatcher's Energy Secretary Cecil Parkinson said Labor's
win is a ``warning to the government it is not as popular as it
would like to be.''
   ``But it is not in any way depressing or intimidating,''
Parkinson added.
   Defeated Conservative candidate Rod Richards acknowledged voter
hostility to the health service program and other reforms Mrs.
Thatcher is pursuing in her third term. They include a new property
tax and selling off the national water and electricity utilities.
   ``We have to win that debate in the country and it will take
time because we are changing things quite radically,'' Richards
said.
   Labor also was boosted by the collapse of support for Britain's
squabbling center parties, which split after the 1987 general
election and adopted rivalries now ridiculed as ``the muddle in the
middle.''
   Labor polled 23,342 votes to the Tories' 17,314. The centrist
Social and Liberal Democratic Party took only 2,017 and the Social
Democractic Party, its previous electoral ally, got 1,098. The
Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru also did badly with 1,672 votes.
   The Vale of Glamorgan, where the previous legislator died this
year, was only the fourth district in 25 years that Labor has
snatched from the Conservatives in a by-election.
   Polling was Thursday, the 10th anniversary of Mrs. Thatcher's
accession to the premiership. Now in her third five-year term, she
must call the next election by mid-1992.
   Until then, she still commands a huge majority of 101 seats in
the 650-member House of Commons. Conservatives have 375 seats,
Labor 228, the Social and Liberal Democrats 19 and the Social
Democratic Party 3. Minority regional parties hold the rest.
   Earlier, the Conservatives and Laborites did well in county
council elections in England and Wales, making substantial gains at
the expense of the center parties.
   Tory and Labor leaders said that British politics is back in the
traditional two-party mold, which was upset by the formation of a
burgeoning centrist alliance in 1981.
   In 1983 and 1987 general elections, the centrists took nearly
one-fourth of the vote, although they won few seats and often
helped a Conservative to victory by splitting the anti-Thatcher
vote.
   In Thursday's elections for 47 county councils, the
Conservatives finished with overall control of 19, up from 12, and
Labor with 13, up from nine.
   The Social and Liberal Democrats kept control of their sole
county council, the Isle of Wight, but lost seats across the
country. Independents had control of two county councils and no
party had overall control in the other 12.
   Adding to Mrs. Thatcher's problems is a resurgence in inflation,
now at 7.9 percent and among the highest in industrialized
countries, and a hefty balance of payments deficit that topped $2.8
billion in March.
   In addition, labor unions are flexing their muscles after years
of defeats.
   Railmen, dockers, engineers, firefighters, electricians, London
subway drivers and BBC journalists and production staff all are
threatening strikes.
   Some Conservative claim the unrest may be organized. ``This is
beginning to look like a conspiracy,'' said Tory legislator Harry
Greenway.
   Nevertheless, the Conservative Party remains ahead in national
opinion polls _ three points ahead of Labor with 42-percent support
matching that of 1987.

   Police say a 15-year-old who put a
straight pin in a jar of his family's baby food apparently did it
to get some attention, solving the last of three food tampering
cases reported in the state this week.
   There were no injuries in any of the cases.
   A Jacksonville family reported Monday that they found a pin in a
jar of apricot-yogurt baby food they bought last week at an Eagle
store.
   Jacksonville Police Chief Thomas Weeks said Thursday that after
investigators interviewed the family extensively and the family
agreed to take polygraph tests, the 15-year-old son admitted to
placing the straight pin in the baby food jar.
   ``I think it has something to do with his getting attention,''
Weeks said of the teen-ager. ``Apparently he had heard about the
situation in Springfield and apparently decided it wasn't a bad
idea.''
   The youth has not been charged, police Lt. Don Cook said today.
   The Jacksonville incident followed one in Springfield Friday in
which a baby sitter said she found pins in two jars of Heinz baby
food. Authorities said Barbara Rexroad reported finding the pins to
make herself look good to the parents.
   Ms. Rexroad, 42, was charged Wednesday with communication of
false information of tainting of a consumer product, a felony
carrying a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a $250,000
fine, said U.S. Attorney J. William Roberts. She was released on
her own recognizance.
   The third case was a candy-tampering hoax in the Decatur area,
police said.
   Kevin Gentry, a 26, of Lovington, was charged Wednesday with
making a false report to police. Gentry reported Tuesday that candy
he bought from a vending machine contained sharp metal pieces. He
was released on $1,000 bond.
   Gentry also is being charged with a federal felony count of
communicating false information of tainting of a food product, U.S.
Attorney Bill Roberts announced today.

<HEAD>Taiwan-U.S. Trade Talks End Without Agreement</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 7-9 to CORRECT spelling of tariff.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Taiwan and U.S. officials ended five days
of trade talks Friday without reaching any agreement, and the
United States urged Taiwan to further liberalize its trade
practices.
   During Friday's session, Taiwan officials provided full details
of the government's plan to cut its trade surplus to the U.S.
delegation, headed by Deputy Assistant U.S. Trade Representative
Mark Orr.
   ``In many areas, the plan has made a positive contribution,''
Orr said, ``but in other areas, the plan is not as ambitious as it
could be.''
   Taiwan presented outlines of the four-year plan to Washington in
March to try to avoid possible trade retaliation by the United
States.
   Under the plan, Taiwan is to liberalize its financial and trade
markets to reduce this island's trade imbalance by at least 10
percent each year and gradually cut import tariffs until they
average 7 percent in 1992.
   Last year, Taiwan registered a trade surplus of $10.4 billion
with the United States.
   However, the U.S. delegation said the plan still allows Taiwan
to maintain high tariffs on agricultural products. The United
States also called for the lifting the ban on Taiwan's imports of
several agricultural products.
   Taiwan's import tariffs for agricutural items currently average
25.99 percent and will be lowered to 19.82 percent in 1992 under
the action plan.
   Officials here argued that the government can only agree to
smaller tariff cuts in agricultural items to protect the interests
of local farmers.
   Donald Bishop, spokesman for the American delegation, said the
U.S. side recognized Taiwan's efforts in the direction of
liberalization, but ``Taiwan is still encouraged to do more.''
   He said Taiwan was also urged to open more access to the United
States to set up bank branches, insurance companies, and security
firms here.
   Last week, Taiwan was cited in a report by the Office of the
U.S. Trade Representative as one of 34 countries which allegedly
impose unfair barriers in trade with the Unied States.
   The U.S. trade representative is expected to select nations by
May 30 for possible sanctions for unfair trade practices under the
``Super 301'' provision of the U.S. Omnibus Trade Act. Many believe
Taiwan, which ranked fourth among the 34 countries may be placed on
the priority list.
   The United States accuses Taiwan of maintaining barriers through
import licensing, limits on access to the insurance market,
agricultural export susidies, ineffective intellectual-property
protection and monopoly practices.

   Talk show host Morton Downey Jr. is being sued by
two songwriters who claim they wrote the theme song for his
syndicated show and have never received any money for it.
   The songwriters, John Beland and Floyd Guilbeau, both of
Hendersonville, Tenn., said Downey claimed co-authorship and
diverted the royalties.
   The lawsuit, filed Thursday in U.S. District Court, said Beland
and Guilbeau wrote the words and music ``to an original musical
work entitled the `Morton Downey, Jr. Theme,' sometimes referred to
as `Morton's Theme' and the `Loudmouth Theme Song.''
   The musicians, members of the Burrito Brothers, a '50s and '60s
revival band, are seeking an unspecified amount in damages and
royalties.
   Downey will not comment on the lawsuit, said his assistant,

   Peace activist and former priest Philip Berrigan
was detained when he arrived in Toronto recently because
immigration authorities said he didn't have a special minister's
permit to enter Canada.
   Dan Heap, a member of Parliament, accused the government of
trying to prevent Berrigan from speaking at a Toronto church rally
Thursday to promote a blockade of an international military weapons
show in Ottawa May 23-25. The speech took place as planned.
   Berrigan, who has been convicted 60 times for offenses such as
burning draft papers, pouring blood on draft files and damaging
military property, arrived Wednesday on a flight from Baltimore and
was detained for six hours.
   A priest posted a $3,000 bond to free Berrigan, but the activist
vowed not to return for a May 11 immigration hearing unless federal
officials permit him to cross the border freely.
   ``What's going on here is the harassment of the peace movement
in the person of one of its most famous and admired
representatives,'' said Heap, who spent almost an hour on the phone
with immigration officials trying to free Berrigan.

   Searchers looking for a light plane missing

today and said the pilot and his 5-year-old son were dead.
   ``The Caddo County sheriff has gone in and found two

   Joe Bickford, 31, of Mountain View, and his son, Jeff, had left

Hobart is about 90 miles southwest of Oklahoma City and 20 miles
west of Mountain View.
   Gould said radar contact with the two-seat plane was lost at
10:15 p.m. near Chickasha, about 60 miles from Hobart.
   The CAP had looked for the plane Thursday but had to call off
the search late in the day because of storms.
   The wreckage was spotted this morning about a mile from the
intersection of Oklahoma Highways 19 and 58.

   Here is a sampling of editorial opinions on the verdicts reached
in the Oliver North trial:
   From New York Newsday:
   The lasting, historical significance of the conviction of Oliver
North is that in this country not even a man labeled a national
hero is above the law. In the end, 12 citizens after 12 days of
deliberation found that North _ no matter what his position, no
matter what his mission, no matter what the president called him _
was guilty. They found that he obstructed a congressional inquiry
into the Iran-contra affair, shredded official U.S. documents and
illegally accepted a $14,000 gratuity. This national hero is now a
convicted felon.

   We hear a lot about this contemporary time's lack of heroes. One
reason we lack them is that we tear down the ones we otherwise
might have _ for instance, Oliver North. Who would want to be a
hero and endure what he has endured?
   Here is a man who has laid down his life for others _ in
Vietnam, in Central America. There are many who owe, in both
places, their lives to his. He has been called a ``hero'' by two
Presidents. A leader of the Contras testified, ``We are going to
erect a monument to Colonel North once we free Nicaragua.''
   Yet he has been run down by the very government for which he
toiled. The President who could have saved him did not. The jury
tried, but came up short. And now, the legalistic hounding will
continue _ of Colonel North and others _ with all the consequent
anguish and cost.

<TEXT>
   From the Austin (Texas) American-Statesman:
   North is no national hero. But he is certainly not totally to
blame for what happened in the Iran-Contra scandal. The jury seems
to have understood that. So should the public.

<TEXT>
   From The Evening Sun in Baltimore:
   From the time Oliver North first came to public attention in the
midst of the Iran-contra affair, he has been a riveting and
controversial figure. Many Americans followed the lead of President
Reagan, who pronounced North a ``national hero'' despite the fact
that he had just fired him. Others saw him more clearly _ as a
complicated man whose energy epitomized the can-do spirit Americans
thrive on, but one whose zeal overcame his judgment.
   Now, in a trial remarkable for its fairness under the glare of
publicity and controversy, a jury has concluded that in three
specific cases North did indeed step over the line that should have
separated vigorous pursuit of his duty from criminal acts. ...
   Americans can admire commitment and zeal. They can admire many
of the qualities Oliver North has long sought to exemplify. But
zeal and commitment must be tempered by judgment. That's one
function of law _ to establish boundaries that impose good judgment
on excessive zeal. North and his supporters are claiming a victory
in the fact that his was acquitted on nine other counts. But those
acquittals do not erase the seriousness of the charges for which he
was found guilty. ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   From The Orange County (Calif.) Register:
   ... It is simply unfair for one low-echelon aide to bear the
brunt of the charges in the Iran-Contra scandal. Perhaps the
appeals courts will realize that and throw the case out. Or perhaps
President Bush will get there first, and pardon Ollie.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   From the Los Angeles Daily News:
   North's trial shares similaries with that of Daniel Ellsberg and
Anthony Russo, who leaked the Pentagon Papers. In the 1973
Ellsberg-Russo case, which ended in a mistrial, the defense argued
not that Ellsberg and Russo were not involved in the leak of the
Pentagon Papers, but that those papers never should have been
classified. North's defense also was based on a disagreement with
the law; most of his actions were predicated on a belief that the
president, not Congress, should run foreign policy...
   In light of Thursday's verdict, the spending of over $12 million
by special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh to build a case against North
has to be considered overkill. ...The good news is that while the
prosecution against North was politically motivated, the jury's
verdict was fair and balanced.
   If ... punishment goes so far, say, as to end the much-decorated
veteran's military pension, President Bush should pardon North, who
has paid greatly for his mistakes as it is.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   From The Morning News Tribune in Tacoma, Wash.:
   The anti-climactic finale to the North affair was a letdown
politically. But that's beside the point.
   It so happened that the passions aroused by the Iran-Contra
scandal came to focus on Oliver North's trial, and that partisans
of both sides sought vindication in the verdict. But in this
country, trials aren't staged for political vindication: They're
held to decide the guilt or innocence of the accused.
   North received all the due process that any defendant could have
asked for.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   From The Boston Globe:
   No man, the jurors found, stands above the law, once again
reaffirming the most basic tenet in the American legal system.
   The rules of law hold even if the wrongdoing conceded by North
was performed under the direction of President Reagan, as North
contended.
   Openly enthusiastic about his covert assignment to arm and
otherwise assist the Nicaraguan Contras at a time when such aid had
been banned by Congress, North undoubtedly believed he was acting
with the understanding and support of his superiors in the National
Security Council and the White House.
   Nor is there reason to doubt that those superiors shared his
conviction. Under almost any other circumstances, they would have
been charged in some way, along with North. Instead, they left him
to face trial alone, whch may have persuaded the jury to dismiss
other counts against him.
   His defense, that he was led to believe that everything he did
was done at the direction of the president, does not excuse him.
   The trial was thorough; the law has been upheld.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   From The Washington Post:
   If the jurors had bought Mr. North's whole defense, they would
have sent a message that any subterfuge, any ignoring of a
congressional mandate, any covert and illegal act in the
furtherance of what a small group inside the government believes to
be in the best interests of the country, is justifiable. They
didn't do that. The verdict is a statement that such acts are wrong
and punishable even if the defendant believed he was acting on the
orders of his superiors. ...
   These jurors were not charged with deciding what other officials
were involved in this deception and cover-up. But in their long
deliberations and mixed verdict, they have indicated that they
don't believe Mr. North was the sole, or even the principal,
offender.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   From the Albany, N.Y., Times Union:
   For many who viewed former Lt. Col Oliver North as a hero,
Thursday's verdict will be hard to accept. Facing 12 counts in
connection with the Iran-contra scandal, he was acquitted of nine
but convicted of three. Was that justice for a loyal Marine who
thought he was serving his country, and assumed tacit approval by
his commander in chief?
   It was if the verdict is seen in the proper light. Iran-Contra
was not about one Marine's loyalty or naivete. It was about a
government within a government, a secret operation that generated
funds by selling arms at a profit, and used the profits to carry
out foreign policy _ all of it outside the parameters of
constitutional government. ...
   ... If Col. North inspires sympathy even now, it's no doubt
because he was used by those higher-ups _ the late CIA director,
William Casey, and two former nation security advisors, Robert
MacFarlane and Admiral John Poindexter. ...
   ... Used or not, Col. North was responsible for obeying the law.
...
   ... The jury understood. Now the American public must understand
as well _ even those who still admire the man more than the verdict.

   The Tehran office of the West German
airline Lufthansa was attacked by an unidentified group of people
while it was closed Friday for the Moslem weekend, Iran's news
agency reported.
   The office ``sustained some damage,'' said the official Islamic
Republic News Agency. It gave no details.
   The incident followed calls in Iranian newspapers for expulsion
of West German diplomats from Tehran reflecting an anti-Western
trend that is being fueled by a fundamentalist revival.
   The Farsi-language Kayhan daily said last month that West German
diplomats in Iran were ``spies disguised as diplomats.''
   Iranian Prime Minister Hussein Musavi said a few days earlier
that West Germany was implicated in a CIA spy network allegedly
uncovered by Iranian intelligence.
   He said that a network of Iranian agents working for the U.S.
Central Intelligence Agency had been exposed, many of whom were
communicating with the agency through West German embassies in
Europe.
   Intelligence Minister Mohammad Mohammadi-Reyshahri later said
the spies were linked with the American military base in Wiesbaden,
West Germany, where many had received training.
   Iran also has accused West Germany of supplying its enemy Iraq
with technology to build long-range missiles and chemical weapons.
   Before relations deteriorated, West Germany was favored by
Tehran to assist in ambitious reconstruction efforts planned after
the Aug. 20 cease-fire in the eight-year Iran-Iraq war.
   West Germany joined the other European Economic Community
nations in temporarily recalling its ambassador from Tehran to
protest Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's Feb. 14 death
sentence against British writer Salman Rushdie, for allegedly
blaspheming against Islam in his novel, ``The Satanic Verses.''
   Iran later severed ties with Britain over the affair.

   Union Station, the landmark rail depot where
Betty Grable vamped for photographers and thousands of servicemen
departed for wars, is 50 years old.
   The celebration was scheduled to get under way today with the
arrival of Southern Pacific's ``Daylight'' locomotive 4449 that
pulled the ``Freedom Train'' across the United States during the
nation's 1976 bicentennial.
   Festivities focusing on Union Station's role as the city's
transportation hub continue through the weekend with exhibits,
speeches and entertainment.
   While airplanes derailed interest in train travel for decades,
depot spokesman Tom Buckley said there has been a resurgence in
Union Station travelers. Amtrak's San Diegan, for instance, carries
5,000 people daily.
   ``More people are coming here everyday, particularly this past
year,'' Buckley said.
   Crowds still stream into downtown Union Station, enraptured by
its ornate 52-foot ceilings, its Spanish-Moorish architecture,
gardens and old Harvey House restaurant.
   Sixty trains a day used the station before World War II, when
100 trains came and went daily, many with soldiers and sailors
going to war.
   After the war, European refugees poured through the station,
which was dedicated May 3, 1939.
   Union Station's grandeur is frequently seen in movies and on TV.
   The grand mission-style building was prominent in the movie
``The Way We Were'' with Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford, the
location for the William Holden movie ``Union Station'' and dozens
of television shows.
   Vivid memories linger among natives who picked up friends and
relatives at Union Station, a trip made complete with a visit to
the nearby Mexican-theme Olvera Street or Philippe's cafe across
the street for a French dip sandwich and coffee, still a nickel a
cup through the 1980s.
   Before the age of air travel, politicians such as Dwight D.
Eisenhower used Union Station to embark on whistle-stops.
   Football fans remember the noisy ceremonies surrounding
departures of the University of Southern California team,
particularly festivities accompanying the trainloads of players and
fans headed for the Notre Dame game in South Bend, Ind.
   In the heydey of train travel, Hollywood publicity men used the
occasion of Union Station celebrity departures and arrivals to
generate press. Betty Grable, Dorothy Lamour and Jackie Gleason
rode the rails in and out of Los Angeles with great fanfare.

<HEAD>Election Day Didn't Settle Questions on Bush's Iran-Contra Role</HEAD>

   While President Bush had reason to feel last
Election Day that the American people had delivered their verdict
on his role in the Iran-Contra affair, much to his annoyance,
questions persist.
   But there is a widespread feeling that the demand for answers
diminishes rapidly the farther one is from Capitol Hill.
   ``The thing has been around so long, it's kind of old news,''
said Mike Hamby, executive director of the Florida Democratic Party.
   With a slight nod toward partisanship, Hamby quickly added that
``if there's any curiosity out there,'' it concerns Bush's role in
the Reagan administration deliberations on arms sales to Iran and
the diversion of funds to the Contras. Bush has said he knew about
the Iran arms sales but has denied any knowledge of the diversion.
   ``I don't think there's any outcry of any kind across this
country for any questions about this issue,'' said Eddie Mahe, a
Republican consultant. ``This issue ceased to exist for the
American people a long time ago.''
   The fact is that neither the foreign policy scandal nor the
persona of Oliver L. North quite lived up to the expectations of
partisans on both sides.
   Democrats saw the Iran-Contra affair as an issue that would
cripple Republican chances to hold the White House in the 1988
election.
   Conservatives saw North, the Marine lieutenant colonel with a
chest full of medals, as a symbol who would rally voters to reject
his Democratic tormentors.
   For a while, both had reason for high hopes.
   ``Where was George?'' shouted exuberant Democrats at their 1988
nominating convention and at later rallies for nominee Michael
Dukakis. It sounded and looked like a great way to focus attention
on the unanswered questions about Bush's role in the affair.
   But voters seemed to care more about Willie Horton than Ollie
North and were more disturbed about the Massachusetts prison
furlough program than the Iran-Contra scandal.
   At the same time, North never emerged as the national hero
conservatives sought.
   Americans responded with a flood of pro-North letters and
telegrams after his televised appearance before congressional
investigators in July 1987, an outpouring that generated a quick
flurry of what was dubbed Olliemania, complete with T-shirts and
appeals that he run for public office.
   North still commands speaking fees of up to $25,000 an
appearance, but his presence no longer makes politicians _
particularly Democrats _ uneasy.
   If anyone is uneasy these days it might be White House aides as
they watch conservatives try to generate pressure on the president
to pardon the former National Security Council aide.
   ``He was never as hot as he was that week in July 1987,'' said
Democratic pollster Peter Hart. ``It was that one period of time,
it was a very short T-shirt sale period.''
   As the jury in the Oliver L. North trial was preparing to
announce its verdict Thursday, Bush welcomed the question about his
role in the Iran-Contra affair as if he thought one more answer
would put an end to the inquiries.
   It didn't and now he might want to take his press secretary's
advice and leave the questions ``to the historians.''
   Bush invoked the prestige of his office in trying, once and for
all, to deal with questions about his meeting with the president of
Honduras in 1985. At issue is whether the then-vice president knew
the Reagan administration was expecting Honduras to aid the Contras
in return for American aid.
   ``The word of the president of the United States _ George Bush _
is, there was no quid pro quo,'' responded Bush.
   ``There has been much needless, mindless speculation about my
word of honor and I've answered it now, definitively,'' said an
obviously annoyed president.
   But as Bush must know, such questions never can be answered
``definitively.''
   Details about the Bush trip to Honduras were disclosed in a memo
placed in evidence at the North trial. The documents suggested Bush
had a greater role than acknowledged in U.S. efforts to keep the
Contras in business. Congressional investigators never got that
information and they now want to know why.
   ``The North trial raised a number of questions that I think are
still unanswered,'' said Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., who chaired the
House investigation of the Iran-Contra affair.
   ``We still have many, many unanswered questions about
Iran-Contra and those should be pursued,'' he said.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said he would
advise the president to refuse to answer further questions.
   ``If there are unanswered questions, my vote would be to leave
them to the historians and others who want to delve into this,'' he
said.

   Mohammad Ahsanullah sold a cow to
get money to rebuild a house lost in last week's tornado, but many
of the storm's other survivors don't have such resources.
   ``I shall never get a house again,'' said Noorjahan Begum, who
had moved into a new two-room home only two days before the tornado
hit the Manikganj area, killing at least 1,100 people.
   The mud-and-straw house was given to her by a volunteer
organization that works for the poor.
   ``Where shall I get the money?'' asked Noorjahan, a 35-year-old
widow who lived with her three children in Nirala, a small village
near Manikganj.
   Like many of the 130,000 people left homeless by the April 26
tornado, Noorjahan and her children are living outdoors and
surviving on government-supplied food.
   The twister slashed through 40 villages, destroying at least
30,000 houses and injuring about 12,000 people.
   Some are suffering from gangrene, and doctors estimate at least
500 people will have to have arms or legs amputated because of
gangrene.
   Ahsanullah, 45, who is well-off by local standards, said he sold
one of his two cows for about $144 to rebuild his tin-roofed,
wooden house in Tilli village.
   The government plan to build 2,400 houses and the non-government
voluntary organizations have promished to construct 4,000 houses.
   Officials at the Relief Ministry said Friday that more than
1,100 people died in the tornado.
   ``We are certain that more that 1,100 people perished in the
tornado,'' said one official, speaking on condition of anonymnity.
   He said the 400 people listed as missing are now reported to be
dead. Among those are 200 fishermen who were in their boats when
the tornado hit about 25 miles northwest of Dhaka.
   The storm also left lingering health problems, because water
facilities were destroyed by the storm and people have been
drinking polluted water.
   Manikganj doctors said they had treated at least 500 people for
diarrhea in the last five days and two had already died.
   Bangladesh is plagued by a cycle of natural disasters that
includes floods, drought, cyclones and tornadoes. The low-lying
nation of 110 million people, most of it barely above sea level,
has an average annual income of $160.
   Last summer, floods killed 1,400 people and left 2.5 million
homeless. A cyclone in November claimed 1,100 lives.
   In Ashkali village near Manikganj, Ashraf Ali sat in the ruins
of his house.
   ``Look, there was a house here. There was a happy home. Now I
have nothing, nothing but an uncertain future,'' said Ali, 65.
   His wife, two daughters and grandson died in the tornado.
   ``There they are, sleeping in peace,'' he said, pointing to a
mass grave. ``I need to join them.''

   Iran on Friday called for a worldwide
campaign of terror against Americans and urged Palestinians to kill
five Westerners for every Arab slain in the Israeli-occupied lands.
   Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani, shown on Iranian TV
leaning on an AK-47 assault rifle, urged Palestinians to ``declare
open war on American interests throughout the world.
   ``Why don't you hijack planes in order to swap prisoners in
Israeli hands, or blow up factories in Western countries?'' he said
in a sermon during the weekly Shiite Moslem prayer session at
Tehran University.
   Rafsanjani, whose emotional speech was broadcast on Tehran Radio
and monitored in Nicosia, was interrupted by thousands of Shiite
worshipers who chanted ``Death to Israel!''
   In Washington, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said
Rafsanjani's comments were ``appalling'' and ``another step
backwards for Iran from the community of civilized nations.
   ``It is an exhortation for Palestinians to commit terrorism and
only serves to confirm that terrorism remains an integral feature
of Ayatollah Khomeini's regime,'' he said.
   Fitzwater said the United States would hold Iran responsible for
any attacks on American interests or citizens.
   He compared the comments to Iran's threats against British
author Salman Rushdie, author of the book ``The Satanic Verses.''
Many Moslems say the book blasphemes Islam and Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini has called for the author to be killed.
   After Rafsanjani's remarks, the official Islamic Republic News
Agency reported that the Tehran office of the West German airline
Lufthansa was attacked Friday while it was closed for the Moslem
weekend.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, gave no details but said the
office ``sustained some damage.''
   In his remarks, Rafsanjani stressed that the United States
should be singled out as Israel's main backer but that Britons and
Frenchmen also should be targets.
   ``If for every Palestinian martyred in Palestine (the
Palestinians) kill five Americans, Britons or Frenchmen outside,
the Zionists would not dare continue these wrongs,'' Rafsanjani
said.
   ``It isn't so hard to kill Americans or Frenchmen, because
they're all over the globe. It's a bit difficult to kill Israelis,
because there aren't as many of them around in other parts of the
world,'' he said.
   At least 460 Palestinians and 20 Israelis have died in the
17-month-old Palestinian uprising against Israeli in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip, which Israel seized from Jordan and Egypt in the
1967 Middle East war.
   Rafsanjani denounced Palestine Liberation Organization leader
Yasser Arafat's peace initiative, in which he has renounced
terrorism and recognized Israel's right to exist.
   The speaker said Israel and its allies ``will never allow the
formation of ... a Palestinian state. It is impossible.''
   The extremist remarks by Rafsanjani, which came on the last
Friday of the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan, underlined a new and
growing anti-Western trend in Iran that is part of a radical
resurgence.
   Khomeini, soon after coming to power in the 1979 Islamic
revolution, set aside May 5 as Qods Day, the Arabic name for
Jerusalem. He has called on Islamic nations to free Jerusalem,
Islam's third holiest city after Mecca and Medina, from Israeli
rule.
   As Rafsanjani spoke, Iran's official Islamic Republic News
Agency reported that millions of Iranians took to the streets in
Tehran and other cities to pledge support for the Palestinians,
chanting ``Death To Israel! Death To America!''
   Rafsanjani, who also is Iran's acting commander-in-chief, said
the West would now say he was ``officially called for acts of
terror.
   He declared: ``Let them say it. Aren't they already saying it?''
   ``They commit atrocities under the guise of human rights? We
will do the same,'' Rafsanjani said. ``We too will strive in the
name of our rights to defend our people.''

   Catherine Watkins told her husband she
loved him, but it took 45 years for Arthur Watkins to get the
message.
   The couple were bowling in Mansfield a couple weeks ago when
Lester Crumb of Mansfield appeared with five ``V-Mail'' letters
Mrs. Watkins had written to her husband while he fought in Europe
during the waning days of World War II.
   That was the first time Watkins had seen the letters.
   Crumb said he found the mail in some boxes he bought for $40
during an auction of the Edward Russell Jr. estate in Mansfield on
April 22. He said Russell probably inherited the letters from his
father.
   But how did letters mailed to an Army unit in Europe end up in
Russell's hands?
   The letters spanned the period from December 1944, the month
Watkins was taken prisoner by German forces during the Battle of
the Bulge in Belgium, to March 4, 1945.
   Mrs. Watkins continued to write after she learned on Jan. 3,
1945, that her husband was missing in action and before she found
out four months later that he was still alive.
   And therein may lie an explanation for what happened to the
letters.
   ``The postmaster knew my wife's father,'' said Watkins. ``Maybe
he thought the letters coming back might upset her and gave them to
Russell.''
   In any event, ``Something told me he was coming back,'' Mrs.
Watkins said.
   The long-lost letters will be kept in a secure place.
   ``I ought to have them laminated,'' Mrs. Watkins said.

   College geology departments across the
nation have been threatened with extinction because of declining
enrollment, but they're on the rebound because of a totally extinct
subject, says a researcher.
   Brisk sales of dinosaur cereal, noodles, toys and books have
inspired educators to use dinosaurs in the classroom, said Bruce
MacFadden, a natural science curator at the Florida Museum of
Natural History who surveyed 50 colleges and universities
nationwide.
   High unemployment in the oil and mining industries and changing
academic requirements had discouraged enrollment until dinosaurs
were emphasized, he said.
   ``People have always been fascinated by dinosaurs, but they're
enjoying renewed interest because of revolutionary new theories
about these giant prehistoric creatures,'' he said.
   ``Enrollment in most dinosaur courses far exceeds other new
courses, sometimes by twice as much,'' said MacFadden, whose
research appears in the May issue of Geotimes magazine.

   House Speaker Jim Wright argued Friday that
his decades of public service outweigh any personal ethical
shortcomings and suggested that political attacks against him are
far more unethical than any failure of his own.
   ``Because I hold passionately to certain political beliefs, I
have made formidable political opponents in 40 years of active
public life,'' Wright said in a Law Day speech on ethics to a
hometown crowd in Fort Worth.
   ``But I have never sought to destroy another man's character,
nor to deprive him of his dignity. In these 40 years of public
life, the most unethical behavior I have witnessed is that of those
who, for their own ravening ambitions, attempt to destroy the
personal reputations of political opponents.''
   Wright's leadership post has been threatened because of a House
ethics committee probe that has alleged Wright broke House rules 69
times in his personal financial dealings.
   By turns combative and contrite, Wright sought in his remarks to
refocus the debate on his ethics to public policy rather than
personal finances. A text of his speech was released by his
Washington office.
   The chairman of the House ethics committee, Rep. Julian Dixon,
D-Calif., said he had read a copy of the speech. ``Everyone's
entitled to their own opinion. I didn't think it addressed the
issues that we're discussing here, nor do I think he should be,''
Dixon said. ``I think he should wait and present that testimony
before the committee.''
   As Wright spoke, the ethics panel continued for the third
straight day to interview participants in a 1988 Texas gas-drilling
venture that has raised suspicions that Wright was steered into the
lucrative deal as a gift to buy favor with a powerful legislator.
   The panel questioned Doug Jaffe, who arranged for Mallightco _
an investment partnership involving Wright, Fort Worth developer
George Mallick, and their wives _ to buy into the gas well venture
in January 1988. Five months later, the $9,120 investment was sold
for a $340,000 profit.
   Wright had placed his interest in Mallightco in a blind trust in
1987 and instructed the trustee to sell that interest in a way that
would earn him enough to pay off a $100,000 loan he had taken out
four years earlier to invest in a nursing home business.
   The nursing home investment went sour and Wright lost most of
his money. But he did receive better treatment than other
investors, collecting some $22,000 in dividends that others were
denied, The New York Times reported Friday.
   Committee Chairman Dixon, D-Calif., said that investment, and
the debt it left for Wright, were relevant to the panel's probe of
the gas drilling deal. The profits from the gas deal were used last
June to pay off the loan Wright obtained to invest in the nursing
home.
   ``Certainly it will be a point of discussion with the committee,
and I think relatively soon, meaning next week,'' he said.
   Dixon said he and the committee's senior Republican, Rep. John
T. Myers of Indiana, also would discuss at that time whether
further investigation into the gas well deal is needed. The
committee still must decide whether to add any charges from the gas
deal to the 69 violations already alleged.
   Wright is expected to go before the ethics committee late this
month for a disciplinary hearing, a trial-like proceeding in which
evidence is presented to determine whether the charges can be
proven.
   In Fort Worth, the speaker listed the values he said he shares
with most Americans: ``To tell the truth. To keep your word. To pay
your debts. To treat other people as you'd have them treat you. To
protect those who are weaker and help those who are more needy than
yourself. To give something of yourself ... To be there when your
country needs you.''
   He said he has sought to carry out those values ``in my own
flawed fashion'' and pointed to his public policy positions
favoring aid for the homeless, education and creation of jobs.
   ``These are some of the things which preoccupy me when I think
of what is moral and what is ethical for a great nation,'' he said.
   He repeated contentions that his problems stem primarily not
from anything he has done, but from his high-profile political
position.
   ``It is a sad and sickening thing to see the political life of
our nation become increasingly dominated by the tactics of negative
campaigning,'' Wright said. ``It contaminates the atmosphere of
political dialogue and poisons the well of creative political
thought.''
   And he continued to criticize the ethics committee's special
outside counsel, Richard Phelan, for overzealousness. ``An
aggressive Chicago law firm, armed with the power of subpoena, has
spent 10 months and almost $2 million of the taxpayers' money
probing my public and private affairs, looking for things to
criticize,'' he said. ``That fact in itself is a commentary of one
sort or another.''

<TEXT>
   The estimated cost of next year's national
census was challenged as too low and the census' likely effect on
Congress was criticized as unfair Thursday in testimony before a
Senate subcommittee.
   Census Bureau estimates of a $2.6 billion pricetag for the
national head count were questioned as probably too low by the
Office of Management and Budget.
   And a University of Maryland scholar asserted that the method
used to reapportion the House of Representatives once census counts
are finished is unfair to the larger states.
   Peyton Young, a professor of public policy, said in testimony
presented to the Subcommittee on Governmental Information and
Regulation that he is not sure the current apportionment method
meets the ``one person one vote'' standard.
   Following each census the seats in the House are redistributed
among the states using a complex formula, adopted in 1941, known as
the ``Method of Equal Proportions.''
   Several other methods have been used in the nation's history,
each with some problem or other.
   At the heart of the dispute is the fact that the House has
limited itself to 435 members. Each state gets one and the
remaining 385 are then divided according to population. That's when
the trouble starts.
   Because congressional districts cannot cross state lines, no
matter what number of people constitute an average district, they
are never divided equally into every state population. The
leftovers cause the problems and have led to long political fights.
   According to Young's calculations, the current system gives
states with fewer people about a 3 percent advantage over larger
states, a difference he considers unfair.
   Meanwhile, government officials disagreed before the
subcommittee about the cost of collecting the data to divide up
those seats.
   C. Louis Kincannon, deputy director of the Census Bureau, said
the agency plans to spend $2.6 billion and can conduct a ``high
quality'' census on that amount of money.
   Gene L. Dodaro of the Office of Management and Budget, however,
said the bureau has not planned for all contingencies. Dodaro
estimated that the 1990 count will cost as much as $3 billion
before it is completed.
   Dodaro also urged Census officials to begin work immediately on
planning for a census in the year 2000, so they can use lessons
learned in 1990 to make that subsequent count easier and more
accurate.

   Friends of Christine Jorgensen will
throw a party rather than hold a memorial service for the woman who
made history 36 years ago with a sex-change operation.
   Miss Jorgensen, who died Wednesday at San Clemente Hospital of
cancer at age 62, wanted her ashes scattered at sea without a
funeral, a friend, Brenda Lana Smith, said Thursday.
   Instead, the woman known as the world's first transsexual _ she
despised the term _ asked that friends and relatives remember her
at a lavish party, which Ms. Smith said would be held in a few
weeks.
   ``She loved to party, and that's what we're going to do,'' said
Ms. Smith, who for the last six months shared an apartment with Ms.
Jorgensen in this Southern California coastal enclave.
   George Jorgensen Jr. made headlines Dec. 1, 1952, when he
underwent a sex-change operation at a Danish hospital and took the
name Christine.
   Over the years she had nightclub acts, gave speeches and wrote a
book, learning to embrace, according to her friend, the publicity
she at first hated.
   ``Chris always got along with reporters,'' Ms. Smith said.
``After all those terrible things they wrote about her early on,
she still liked them. Chris liked everyone.''
   Ms. Jorgensen learned she had bladder cancer in 1987, and
doctors found brain tumors six weeks ago, Ms. Smith said. She
underwent chemotherapy for 18 months, but when her condition
deteriorated at the end she decided to forgo life-support
machinery, the friend said.
   Ms. Jorgensen asked that donations in her memory be made to the
Motion Picture Actors Home in Woodland Hills.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration on Friday named South
Korea, West Germany and Japan as countries that need to do more to
reduce the huge trade surpluses they are running with the United
States.
   The administration's assessment, delivered by Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady and Undersecretary-designate David Mulford, was
particularly critical of West Germany and South Korea.
   The officials, testifying before the Senate Banking Committee,
indicated those two countries needed significant changes in policy
to promote reductions in global trade imbalances.
   Mulford said pointedly that discussions with South Korean
officials had at times been ``quite frustrating.'' While some
progress has been made in getting the government to allow its
currency to strengthen in relation to the U.S. dollar, Mulford said
more needed to be done in this area to make U.S. goods cheaper in
Korea.
   Earlier this week, South Korean Deputy Prime Minister Soon Cho
met with administration officials in Washington to discuss trade.
Cho indicated to reporters that he was resisting pressure to allow
the Korean currency to appreciate further against the dollar.
   In his testimony, Mulford said that negotiations with South
Korea were continuing and he said he hoped to be able to report
progress by Oct. 15, when the law requires the next report on
currency negotiations to be presented to Congress.
   Mulford said that the requirement in last year's trade law for
the administration to target countries unfairly manipulating their
currencies to boost their trade surpluses had been helpful in the
on-going negotiations with South Korea and Taiwan.
   Brady said that Taiwan had made more progress in the currency
area. He said that Taiwan's currency may now be at the proper
level, given the fact that it has risen 12 percent against the
dollar just since last October.
   Mulford indicated that the administration was satisfied with the
dollar's current level against most major currencies, such as the
Japanese yen and the West German mark. He repeated a commitment by
the seven major industrial nations on April 2 that they would work
to keep the dollar from rising further or dropping too sharply.
   In his prepared testimony, Brady said that international efforts
to coordinate trade and economic policies were showing results but
that more progress was needed.
   Brady noted that the U.S. merchandise trade deficit narrowed by
21 percent last year, after hitting a record $152 billion in 1987,
and predicted further improvement, although at a slower pace, in
1989.
   But Brady said the Japanese need to do more to open their
markets to foreign goods, especially in view of the fact that
Japan's trade surplus fell only modestly in 1988 and is expected to
be little changed this year. The United States ran a trade deficit
of $52 billion with Japan last year, the largest with any nation.
   In discussing West Germany, Brady was even more critical,
stating that progress made by that nation in reducing its trade
surpluses ``has been less satisfactory'' than in Japan.
   He said Germany's trade surplus rose to record levels in 1988
and is expected to climb even higher in 1989.
   Brady said in the United States, hitting the Gramm-Rudman
federal deficit target of $100 billion for next year would be the
most important thing America could do to lower the deficit.
   Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich. and chairman of the Banking
Committee, said he feared that the big improvement in the trade
deficit registered in 1988 had already stalled out and the deficit
could begin rising again.
   He said such a development would have ominous consequences for
America's efforts to reduce its dependence on foreign investment.

   The South Bank Center, which claims to be the
world's largest arts complex, is looking for a marketing manager in
the United States after failing to find anyone suitable at home.
   ``We have not been getting the right person in response to our
advertisements here over several weeks so we are going to try in
the United States, particularly in New York and Los Angeles,'' said
Rosalyn Fry, the center's press officer.
   She said the first advertisements will appear in the Los Angeles
Times on Sunday and The New York Times on May 14. The job will pay
$40,000 a year.
   The center on the south bank of the Thames includes the Royal
Festival Hall and two other halls for concerts, a total seating of
4,300; the Hayward Gallery for major art exhibitions; and the
Jubilee Gardens for outdoor events.
   Miss Fry said the center had income last year of $51 million,
including ticket sales, shops, franchises and a government subsidy
of $18.7 million.
   The center has been under pressure to earn more to enable the
Arts Council, which distributes government money for the arts, to
reduce the subsidy.
   The center sold 2.5 million tickets for all events last year but
had 6 million visitors because entry to parts of it is free and
anyone can use the catering facilities.
   Richard Pulford, the center's general director for
administration, said he hopes to visit Los Angeles later this month
and he will interview applicants for marketing manager if the
advertisements draw a response.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, in a
move to accelerate Arab-Israeli negotiations, will send a top aide
to the Middle East next week to test support for U.S. peace
efforts, it was announced Friday.
   Dennis Ross, who heads the State Department's policy planning
staff and counsels Baker on events in the region, will hold talks
in Israel and Egypt, the State Department spokeswoman, Margaret
Tutwiler, said.
   Ross will be accompanied by Daniel Kurtzer, a specialist on the
Middle East who is on his staff, and hold talks in Jordan as well,
said another U.S. offical who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   Ross will go to the Middle East from Moscow after participating
in talks Baker will hold with Soviet leaders. The search for a
negotiating formula is one of the the major regional issues Baker
intends to discuss with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Ms. Tutwiler said Ross would provide a briefing on the Moscow
talks and also look into ``the next steps in the peace process.''
   Baker has endorsed a proposal by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir for elections among Palestinian Arabs on the West Bank and
in Gaza. The winners would negotiate with Israel arrangements for
temporary self-rule. Israel, Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinians
then would negotiate an overall settlement.
   The Arab League and the Palestine Liberation Organization have
rejected the proposal, while Egypt and Jordan have taken ambiguous
positions. Baker has asked all sides to withhold final judgments
until the details are worked out.
   His approach to the Soviets, another U.S. official said, will be
to ask their support for direct Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.
This would mean a shift away from Moscow's persistent call for an
international peace conference.
   The United States is lukewarm to a conference unless it is no
more than a device to further direct negotiations. Since the
Soviets would be one of the sponsors, a conference could provide an
opportunity for them to wield their influence on the outcome.

   Authors Neil Sheehan and Jonathan Kozol
received the ninth annual Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Book Awards at
a luncheon Friday at the late senator's Hickory Hill residence in
suburban McLean, Va.
   Ethel Kennedy, widow of the late Democratic senator from New
York and 1968 presidential contender, presided over the awards
lunch in the living room of her home. Her guests included several
Kennedy children; Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and the judges
for the book awards.
   Sheehan received a $2,500 check for ``A Bright Shining Lie,''
his Pulitzer Prize-winning book about U.S. involvement in the
Vietnam War focusing on Army officer John Paul Vann. The same prize
was presented to Kozol for ``Rachel and Her Children,'' which dealt
with homeless families in America.
   The awards were announced in late March by John Seigenthaler,
editor and publisher of the Nashville Tennessean and chairman of
the book awards. Seigenthaler said both winners reflected ``the
power of the human spirit to survive barriers of adversity and to
overcome bars of injustice, ineptitude and deception.''
   A third book, ``Within Our Reach'' by Lisbeth and Daniel Schorr,
received honorable mention.
   The awards judges who were invited to the luncheon were author
Frances Fitzgerald, journalist Jeff Greenfield, editor Ed Guthman
and historian Alex Haley. The awards were created with a grant from
scholar Arthur Schlesinger Jr., a former White House adviser to
President Kennedy.
   The awards are intended to recognize literary works that deal
with issues that were of special concern to Robert Kennedy,
including the poor and powerless in American society.

<HEAD>Three South African Diplomats Ousted Over Arms Deal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain ousted three South African diplomats
Friday over their country's alleged role in a deal with Northern
Ireland extremists to swap guns for British missile technology.
   Although the South African government denied involvement, the
Foreign Office appeared to implicate Pretoria when it spoke of
``the grave concern with which Her Majesty's Government viewed the
involvement by South African officials in this affair.''
   It gave the South Africans one week to withdraw First Secretary
for Information Jan H.P. Castelyn, Counselor Jonathan Fourie, and
Staff Sgt. Mark Brunner, who works in the defense attache's office.
   While there was no suggestion they were implicated in the
affair, their expulsion is a rebuff at a time when Pretoria's
relations with Britain seemed to be warming.
   It came two weeks after French police raided a Paris address and
arrested a South African diplomat, an American arms dealer and
three militant Protestants from Northern Ireland.
   The Northern Irelanders, one a warrant officer in the province's
Territorial Army, allegedly were handing over parts of a Blowpipe,
a shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missile manufactured in Belfast.
   British officials say they are gravely concerned by charges the
South Africans were supplying weapons to the Protestants in
exchange for the missile parts.
   The arrested South African, identified by French sources as
Daniel Storm, was released after claiming diplomatic immunity. A
week later, the French government expelled three South African
officials implicated in the affair.
   The three Irishmen and American Douglas Bernhart are being held
in France on gun-running and conspiracy charges.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher took the lead in ordering the
expulsions, angered that she should be repaid in such a manner for
defending South Africa against a world drive for economic
sanctions, said the domestic Press Association news agency.
   The Foreign Office said Permanent Undersecretary Sir Patrick
Wright summoned South African Ambassador Rae Killen and informed
him of the expulsions.
   Wright warned that South Africans should be ``under no
illusions'' about how gravely London views the affair.
   He reminded that South Africa is under a U.N. arms embargo, and
that ``the lives of innocent people are at risk'' in Northern
Ireland.
   British press reports say the South Africans are even more
interested in the Blowpipe's sophisticated successor, the
Starstreak. This week, newspapers reported that two technicians
from Shorts, the state-owned manufacturer of Blowpipe and
Starstreak, have been hired at four times their salaries to work
for the South African arms industry.
   South African Defense Minister Gen. Magnus Malan acknowledged on
April 24 that South Africa sometimes uses ``unconventional
methods'' to get around the arms embargo.
   President P.W. Botha called the Blowpipe affair a
``transgression'' he regretted, while Malan said an official
inquiry showed Storm acted without government approval.
   Malan said he regretted the embarrassment caused to the British,
French and Irish governments and would make sure it did not happen
again.

<TEXT>
   President Bush, making the first trip to
Eastern Europe by a U.S. president in more than 11 years, will
visit Hungary and Poland in July to demonstrate support for their
political and economic reforms, the White House said Friday.
   The stops, most likely to fall July 11-13, will come immediately
before Bush arrives in Paris for the annual economic summit of the
world's seven richest nations. The summit will be July 14-16.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said other
countries may be added to Bush's itinerary after Paris. Likely
candidates include Portugal and the Netherlands.
   ``I look for a lengthy and productive trip,'' Fitzwater said.
   The possibility of a Bush visit to Yugoslavia was raised by
sources close to the Yugoslav government. The sources said
prospects of a Bush visit will be discussed soon. However, White
House officials said privately that such as stop was unlikely.
   Announcing the stops in Warsaw and Budapest, Fitzwater said that
the United States has been trying ``to prod movement towards
democracy and economic incentives in Poland.
   ``This is an opportunity for the president to reinforce the
United States' commitment, to express directly to the Polish people
our support for the direction in which they are moving, express our
support for Solidarity and the work of Lech Walesa,'' Fitzwater
said.
   ``And the president's very personal interest in this should make
this a very interesting trip,'' he added.
   Bush has frequently talked about being deeply moved by his
September 1987 visit to Warsaw, where he met with Walesa and the
mother of a slain Roman Catholic priest.
   Bush will be only the third sitting U.S. president to visit
Eastern Europe since World War II. The last was Jimmy Carter who
went to Poland in December 1977. Richard M. Nixon also visited
Poland and Romania.
   In September 1983, as vice president, Bush went to Yugoslavia,
Romania and Hungary.
   Hungary and Poland, military allies of the Soviet Union, are
undergoing changes in their economic and political structures that
are seen here as promising.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III met in Vienna earlier this
year with the Hungarian and Polish foreign ministers and authorized
U.S. officials to speak positively of developments in the two
countries.
   Hungary is making big strides in economic changes, and even has
a small stock market in operation, while Poland has recognized the
independent trade union movement Solidarity.
   On April 17, Bush announced economic incentives to reward Poland
for steps taken toward democracy and to encourage further political
and economic reforms. The package included asking Congress to lower
tariffs on certain Polish imports and seeking congressional
approval of U.S.-guaranteed loans to stimulate private investment
in Poland.
   The president also announced a new U.S. willingness to work with
other Western financial leaders to help Poland deal with its $38
million foreign debt.
   Fitzwater did not release any details of Bush's trip, but
sources said the initial itinerary calls for Bush to spend a day in
Budapest and a night in Warsaw before the Paris meeting.

<TEXT>
   A former Unisys Corp. representative was
ordered to perform 200 hours of community service Friday for
concealing illegal political donations from defense contractors to
a congressman.
   Robert D. Barrett, 55, who is cooperating with the Justice
Department's ``Ill Wind'' investigation of Pentagon procurement
fraud, was given a suspended three-year sentence and placed on two
years' probation by U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton.
   Barrett was sentenced for his admissions that he concealed from
the Federal Election Commission two $1,000 donations he collected
from defense firms and funneled to the re-election campaign fund of
the late Rep. William Chappell Jr., D-Fla.
   Barrett pleaded guilty Jan. 27 to conspiring to defraud the FEC
and causing a false report to be filed with the agency to conceal
the donations.
   Chappell, who was not charged in the case, denied ever knowing
his campaign had received illegal corporate donations. Chappell,
who died last month, was defeated for re-election in a close vote
last fall.
   During the brief sentencing hearing, Assistant U.S. Attorney
Joseph Aronica said Barrett's cooperation with government
prosecutors ``resulted in the rapid movement of the investigation
and has opened up other areas of investigation.''
   Several Unisys officials had entered guilty pleas as a result of
Barrett's cooperation, Aronica noted. The prosecutor did not oppose
a defense request that Barrett be placed on probation.
   Among those whose convictions Barrett helped obtain was that of
Charles F. Gardner, a former general manager of Unisys's
surveillance and fire control systems divsion in Great Neck N.Y.
   Gardner has pleaded guilty to bribery, conspiracy and filing
false statements. He has admitted bribing Melvyn Paisley, a former
assistant Navy secretary for research, engineering and systems, by
purchasing Paisley's Sun Valley, Idaho, condominium at an inflated
price.
   Paisley has not been charged, even though he is under
investigation.
   At Friday's hearing, defense attorney James Bensfield said
Barrett ran afoul of the law when he followed Gardner's orders.
``Basically, he was carrying out the only orders of his only boss
in the company at the time,'' Bensfield said.
   ``We're not talking about bribes here. We're not talking about
the misuse of sensitive procurment information,'' Bensfield said.
   Barrett told the judge, ``I made the mistake of trying to be a
good soldier ... I've learned a lot this last year. I'll never make
the same mistake again.''

   The Estonian Communist Party has removed 22
officials in a bid to halt its own waning popularity, officials and
journalists said Friday.
   The housecleaning strengthens newcomers to Estonian party
leadership who are generally more progressive and tend to support
the tiny Baltic republic's declaration of sovereignty.
   The 22 dropped from the Central Committee on Thursday already
had either left the republic or retired, said Estonian Foreign
Ministry spokesman Valle Feldman. The group included former party
chief Karl G. Vaino, Feldman said.
   Estonian People's Front leader Marju Lauristen, who spoke at
Thursday's party meeting, accused some of the retiring members of
involvement in the deportation of tens of thousands of Estonians to
Siberia and the Far North in the 1940s and 1950s.
   Lauristen, also a Communist Party member, said several of the
retirees were ``big bosses who participated in the deportations,''
Estonian radio reporter Sulev Halek said in a telephone interview.
   Feldman said the Communist Party's declining popularity was a
factor in Thursday's action. A recent public opinion poll in
Estonia found that more than 50 percent of residents support the
People's Front, a grass-roots nationalist group, while only 7
percent back the Communist Party, he said.
   The Estonian Communist Party ``must now take radical steps and
quickly work out a program'' if it wants to hold its own among
other political groups that are flourishing in Estonia, Feldman
said.
   The 22 were removed ``according to their own request'' in a move
similar to the housecleaning last week in Moscow that dropped 110
former officials from the national Communist Party's leadership, he
said.
   ``They were, to a great degree, responsible for the sad position
we're in now, so of course they should take the consequences for
it,'' Feldman said.
   Vaino, who served as Estonian Communist Party chief for almost a
decade, was replaced in June 1988 after months of criticism for
inaction on pollution and corruption.
   His replacement, Vaino I. Vyalyas, is a reformer supported by
the Popular Front.
   In a speech Thursday, Vyalyas attacked several newspapers for
supporting the radical Estonian National Independence Party, which
seeks Estonian secession from the Soviet Union, said Eve Parnaste,
a leader of that group.
   Feldman said Vyalyas also criticized Interdvizhenie, a largely
Russian group that objects to rising nationalism and political
reform.
   In neighboring Latvia, the republic's parliament on Friday
adopted a law opposed by Interdvizhenie declaring Latvian the
official language of the republic, according to residents and the
official Tass news agency.
   The Latvian Communist Party leadership on Thursday approved the
draft law in the republic's capital of Riga despite opposition from
many non-Latvian residents, said Latvian Foreign Ministry official
Albert Liepa.
   Liepa said the law was proposed because ``in many ways, the
Latvian language has taken second place to Russian'' in much of the
republic.
   Lithuania and Estonia adopted similar language laws last year.

   A memorial for Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy,
held yearly with little fanfare, has gained attention with a
lawsuit against talk show host Morton Downey Jr. and the relocation
of the John Birch Society to this city.
   ``It will certainly make Appleton a hotspot for conservatism,
although I don't think they want to be,'' Milwaukee lawyer Thomas
Bergen said Friday. He joined McCarthy's anti-communist efforts
after the two met in 1934 at Marquette University Law School.
   For each of the 32 years since McCarthy died, Bergen's Sen.
Joseph R. McCarthy Education Foundation Inc. has honored the
Republican senator with a ceremony at McCarthy's grave at St.
Mary's Cemetery. This year's ceremony is Sunday.
   McCarthy, a native of nearby Grand Chute, led a crusade in the
early 1950s, alleging communist influence in government,
entertainment and other areas of U.S. society.
   His methods led to his censure by the Senate in 1954. He died in
1957.
   The new exposure has not been accepted well by all officials in
the city of 65,000 located on the banks of the Fox River in eastern
Wisconsin.
   ``I cannot help where McCarthy was born. In fact I can remember
the McCarthy hearings ... But I don't feel I have to comment about
it. McCarthy is dead and gone,'' said Mayor Dorothy Johnson.
   Birch Society head G. Allen Bubolz, who political organization
emphasizes fighting communism and reducing the size of the U.S.
government, said his group decided to relocate in Appleton for
convenience. It was ``just a bit of wonderful irony'' that it would
be in McCarthy's hometown, he said.
   Bergen's lawsuit against Downey directly involves Sunday's
ceremony and comes at a time when Downey is a focus of national
controversy about free-speech rights.
   A full-page advertisement that ran Friday in USA Today reads
``Burn Mort? Why not just burn the Constitution. We believe in Mort
... We believe in freedom.'' It is signed by 25 people from a range
of professions, including real estate developer Donald Trump,
entertainer Robert Goulet, Harvard law professor Allen Dershowitz.
   The suit filed this week in Outagamie County Circuit Court seeks
$110,000, claiming Downey promised Jan. 16 to be a guest speaker at
the ceremony and then withdrew in April.
   Downey said Friday he talked with Bergen in January and told him
he would speak at the McCarthy ceremony only if he did not have a
schedule conflict.
   ``What do they have to do, sue people to get people to come
there?'' Downey asked during a phone interview from his New York
office.
   ``I made an oral agreement with Mr. Bergen ... that I would
appear if the dates did not conflict and the dates conflict,'' he
added. ``As much as I would like to be there I cannot because I
have contracts, written contracts. Now Mr. Bergen, being a lawyer,
should understand that.''
   Bergen said Downey's oral contract constituted the same binding
agreement as a written contract under Wisconsin law.
   Bergen also said Downey's office had told him it would send a
videotape of the talk show host to use at the ceremony, but it was
not received.
   Michael O'Brien, a history professor at University of Wisconsin
Fox Valley Center in Menasha and author of a book on McCarthyism,
dismissed renewed interest in McCarthy and the Birch Society as
fleeting.
   ``I don't think there is a rebirth of McCarthyism. I think it's
a pretty shallow thing on the whole,'' he said.
   ``It was more of an accident that Joe McCarthy was born here and
more of an accident that the John Birch Society is moving here,''
O'Brien said.

   President Bush's spokesman accused the Soviet
Union of working ``assiduously'' to divide NATO partners on Friday,
as Bush and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl conferred without
apparent progress in a dispute over short-range missiles in Europe.
   The two leaders' 20-minute phone call did little to settle
differences concerning Kohl's support for East-West talks on
eliminating battlefield nuclear weapons from Western Europe, said
White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   ``The United States' posture has not changed,'' Fitzwater said.
He said Kohl initiated the phone call.
   ``Discussions that would lead to a ... de-nuclearization of
Europe would not be welcome,'' Fitzwater added.
   The spokesman voiced sharp skepticism toward peace initiatives
by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and suggested the Soviets
are seeking to exploit the current NATO rift.
   ``The Soviets have worked assiduously to try to divide the
alliance. General Secretrary Gorbachev has made any number of
proposals trying to convince people that there is no longer a
threat from the Soviet Union. And we are very wary of that
approach,'' Fitzwater said.
   In Vienna, Soviet and East German diplomats used Friday's
resumption of East-West talks on conventional weapons to emphasize
Warsaw Pact support for parallel talks on reducing short-range
nuclear weapons.
   East German Ambassador Klaus-Dieter Ernst insisted such
negotiations are vital to Germans, telling a news conference: ``The
shorter the range of the rockets, the more dead Germans.''
   West Germany and some European NATO members want superpower
talks on reducing tactical nuclear weapons, but the United States
and Britain oppose such talks at least until the Soviet superiority
in conventional weapons is erased.
   The Bush administration also wants to modernize the aging
arsenal of Lance missiles clustered in Western Europe, many of them
in West Germany.
   Fitzwater said Friday that while the United States is open to
talks within NATO on resolving the rift, ``it does not appear a
basis for agreement is there.''
   Of Friday's Bush-Kohl phone conversation, Fitzwater said, ``I
would not characterize it as moving the situation one way or
another.''
   The flap threatens to disrupt a North Atlantic Treaty
Organization summit late this month, called to celebrate the
alliance's 40th anniversary.
   But Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, who met with
Bush this week, predicted a solution would be found at the summit,
based on a linkage between cuts in conventional and short-range
nuclear arms agreed on by the allies last year.
   Speaking at the National Press Club, Brundtland said Friday,
``We can negotiate for lower levels both in conventional and
short-range (weapons), and I do think it is possible to reach
common ground on that basis.''

   A court Friday convicted a
gynecologist of violating laws restricting abortions and sentenced
him to 2{ years in prison and banned him from practicing medicine
for three years.
   The verdict drew protests from women's groups and the political
opposition, which demanded that abortion laws be relaxed.
   A bomb threat forced evacuation of the court in the Bavarian
village of Memmingen and caused a 90-minute delay in announcing a
verdict. No bomb was found.
   Dr. Horst Theissen was accused of providing abortions to scores
of women in violation of regulations imposed in 1976, three years
after the operation was legalized.
   Abortion is legal during the first three months of pregnancy if
the mother's health is at risk; in cases of rape of incest; or if
there is proof the birth would cause ``extraordinary hardship.''
   In addition, women must have two doctors confirm they fulfill
legal requirements for abortion and also must show proof they
received counseling on adoption as an alternative.
   The case against Theissen, 50, began in 1986 with an anonymous
tip.
   Authorities raided his practice and impounded 1,390 patients'
records. Hundreds of his patients were ordered to fill out detailed
questionnaires about their sexual behavior and personal finances or
face prosecution themselves.
   The investigation resulted in indictments against Theissen and
against 156 women who prosecutors said had undergone abortions
without documenting the counseling and examination requirements.
   Most of the women were fined up to $1,600.
   The chief judge in Theissen's eight-month trial, Albert Barner,
said the gynecologist ``deliberately went against the law, which
stresses the protection of the fetus over a woman's freedom of
choice.''
   Theissen was found guilty on 36 counts of performing abortions
without establishing that the women would suffer hardship because
of childbirth, 39 counts of giving abortions without seeking a
second opinion or the mandatory counseling, and four counts of
attempted abortion.
   Theissen's defense lawyers said they would appeal.
   A small group of pro-abortion activists demonstrated outside the
court, and many women in the courtroom shed tears when the verdict
was announced.
   The leftist Greens party said the verdict was a ``catastrophe
for women.''
   Ingrid Wetting-Danmeilmeier, chief of the women's section of the
opposition Social Democratic party, called the country's abortion
law one of the most backward in Europe.

   Kandia Kouyate, in flowing, sequined gown and
matching turban, glides onstage singing tales of her West African
people.
   Coming to the stage of Boston's Opera House after Pygmy dancers,
Nigerian horn players and Pende dancers from Zaire, Kouyate is the
diva of ``Africa Oye!'' a presentation of traditional and modern
African music that launched a 10-week U.S. tour Thursday night.
   She sings in her own language of the centuries-old history of
the Mandingue people, a technique of oral history that makes her a
virtual walking library.
   ``Don't even try to pierce the mystery that the Mandingue hides.
   ``Don't disturb the spirits at their eternal rest.
   ``Don't enter dead cities to question the past,'' reads a
translation of her song provided by the show's producers.
   Although the sell-out crowd of 2,600 may not understand the
words, her rich, high voice brings it to its feet.
   After five concerts in Boston, the tour goes on to New York,
Baltimore, Washington, San Antonio and Los Angeles.
   For the performers, it is an odyssey as much as a tour since
many are seeing skyscrapers, elevators and superhighways for the
first time.
   ``In my country, the dancers and musicians are repressed because
it is thought to be primitive,'' said Botika Ekalaka, a member of
the Batwa-Ekonda Pygmy performers, speaking in French through an
interpreter. ``It's quite extraordinary to find it appreciated
here.''
   Ekalaka said of the evening's performance that he had never seen
so many people together in one place.
   For some participants, ``Africa Oye!'' is not the first time
they've appeared on stage. Pop singer Papa Wemba has toured the
world with his nine-piece band playing a blend of African rhythms
and Western instruments.
   Kouyate has been broadcast across Africa and performed on
television.
   The show, more than two years in the making, is no mere
collection of African music, its producers say. They scoured remote
regions of Africa for the masters of various traditional and more
modern musical techniques. Among the 52 participants in nine groups
are artists from Zaire, Senegal, Mali, Guinea and Niger.
   ``The key to this is the variety, the musical sophistication and
the raw power,'' said Mel Howard, producer of the American tour.
``African art is very direct. It doesn't go to the mind for
analysis. It goes directly to the emotions.''
   Some of the performers began their pieces on the stage and in
the audience creating a thunderous stereo effect.
   ``One of our tests is to keep the audience where they are,
because there is a tendency for an audience to join in,'' said
Jeremy Alliger, head of an avant-garde performance group called The
Dance Umbrella, which is presenting the Boston shows.

   Workers protesting an ailing economy
and the military's role in the government staged a general strike
Friday, shutting down schools, businesses and mass transit.
   No violence was reported, but streets in Paramaribo, the
capital, were crowded with private cars and pedestrians curious
about the success of the strike.
   Employees reported for work at the state-run Suriname Aluminum
Corp., the former Dutch colony's main source of foreign revenue,
and at the government power company. Police and firefighters were
exempt from the strike.
   The 24-hour general strike called by four labor federations
closed about 80 percent of businesses, schools and government
offices. Public transportation, including buses and river ferries,
was halted.
   The strike was called to show discontent with the government of
President Ramsewak Shankar, who took office in January 1988 after
almost eight years of military dictatorship.
   Labor leaders said they called the strike to protest the
deteriorating economy, which includes 60 percent inflation, and
growing drug trafficking.
   Union leaders also want Shankar to rein in the politically
powerful 3,000-man army. Civilian leaders have little control over
the military, and army critics and human rights leaders are often
arrested by military police.
   Another aim of the strike was to press the Netherlands to renew
a $1.5 billion aid program begun in 1975, when Suriname gained
independence.
   The Hague suspended aid after the military killed opposition
leaders in late 1982. Negotiations over renewal have stalled, with
Suriname objecting to the Netherlands' demand for more control over
how the money is spent.

   President Bush, over Panamanian objections,
will send a 14-person commission to observe what he predicts will
be fraudulent elections in the Central American nation Sunday, the
White House said Friday.
   The observers, led by Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., will leave
Saturday and fly to a U.S. air base in Panama to avoid that
nation's visa requirements, said White House press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater.
   Naming the observer panel is part of the Bush administraion's
strategy to focus world attention on the election in Panama, where
the United States has tried unsuccessfully for more than a year to
get Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega to relinquish power as the
country's de facto ruler.
   Panamanian officials have made it clear the offical U.S.
observer team would not be welcome.
   One U.S. official noted that if Panama blocks the U.S. observers
from visiting polling places, the action would serve the
administration's purposes of casting Noriega in a bad light.
   Bush and administration officials have predicted Noriega will
steal the election for his presidential candidate, Carlos Duque.
They cite numerous instances of registration and ballot
improprieties in the election preparations.
   Fitzwater said U.S. officials ``have informed the appropriate
authorities'' in Panama about the team's arrival. However, he said
he did not know how the Panamanians had responded.
   ``We're sending them in without visas. They probably won't have
to have them,'' Fitzwater said.
   But reports from Panama have quoted officials as saying the
observers would not be welcome and that only those invited by the
government will be allowed to observe the balloting.
   ``That in itself would be a comment on the `free and open'
nature of their elections,'' Fitzwater said when asked about
Panamanian objections to a U.S. team.
   ``We would expect this delegation to be able to observe many
aspects of the election. ... We expect they will have access to a
number of opportunities'' to view the polling places,'' Fitzwater
said.
   ``We have every reason to believe they'll be able to carry those
out.''
   Private observer teams also have been organized, one headed by
former Presidents Carter and Ford under the auspices of the
non-profit National Democratic Institute for International Affairs
and the National Republican Institute for International Affairs.
   Other members of the official U.S. observer team are Reps. Larry
Smith, D-Fla.; Lawrence Coughlin, R-Pa.; Alan Mollohan, D-W.Va.;
Dan Glickman, D-Kan., and Robert Lagomarsino, R-Calif., plus Sens.
John McCain, R-Ariz.; Bob Graham, D-Fla., and Connie Mack, R-Fla.
   Also in the delegatin are Miami Mayor Javier Suarez, former
Ambassador to Panama Jack Vaughn, former Sen. Richard Stone of
Florida, Andrew Gibson of the Panama Canal Commission and Michael
Kozak, acting assistant secretary of state for inter-American
affairs.
   At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the
government's electoral tribunal has released figures showing that
more than 1.18 million Panamanians are registered to vote in
Sunday's elections, ``an unbelievable increase of over 160 per cent
of the total numnber of votes cast in the 1984 elections.''
   Under questioning, she said any increase of such magnitude would
indicate the figures are falsified.
   She also said that so-called ``dignity battalions'' in Panama
are being armed to intimidate the opposition and to discourage all
thoughts of organized protest after the election.

   An Army laboratory has identified the remains
of four American servicemen missing from the Vietnam War, the
Pentagon said Friday.
   The four were identified by the Army's Central Identification
Laboratory in Honolulu after being repatriated to the United States
by Vietnam last December, the Pentagon added in a statement.
   All four of the servicemen were aviators in the Air Force lost
in combat over North Vietnam. The remains will be flown Tuesday
from Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii to Travis Air Force Base,
Calif., ``for their final journey home,'' the Pentagon said.
   It said the family of one of the four had asked that his name
not be released. The other three were identified as:

   _Lt. Col. Charles E. Cappelli of the Air Force, born March 14,
1930, lost over what was then North Vietnam Nov. 17, 1967. He had
listed his home of record as Providence, R.I.
   _Lt. Col. Robert J. Panek Sr. of the Air Force, born June 10,
1939, lost over North Vietnam Jan. 28, 1970. Listed his home of
record as Chicago.
   _Capt. George B. Lockhart of the Air Force, born Feb. 17, 1947,
lost over North Vietnam Dec. 21, 1972. Listed his home of record as
Alexandria, Va.
   The Pentagon said the four sets of remains were among 38
repatriated by Vietnam Dec. 15. Fourteen remains from that group
have now been identified.
   With the latest identifications, 2,360 Americans continue to be
listed as missing in Indochina as a result of the Vietnam war, of
whom 1,726 are listed as missing in either Vietnam, 545 in Laos, 83
in Cambodia and six in China.
   All told, the remains of 193 Americans have been repatriated
from Vietnam and subsequently identified by the Army lab since the
end of the war. An additional 28 have been identified after
recovery from Laos and two after recovery from China.
   ``The U.S. government appreciates the increased efforts of the
Vietnamese government that resulted in accounting for these
Americans and hopes that unilateral turnover of information and
remains will continue to bring accelerated results, and that joint
investigative efforts will become increasingly productive,'' the
Pentagon said in its statement.

   Academy award-winning actress Patty Duke went
to Capitol Hill on Friday to plead for greater federal spending for
mental health research.
   Duke also delivered petitions containing 400,000 signatures of
relatives of victims of mental illness to the Senate Appropriations
subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services.
   ``There is treatment. You do get well,'' said the actress, whose
own battle against manic-depression was chronicled in the
autobiography ``Call Me Anna.''
   ``Having been through it, you don't want others to go through
it,'' she added, speaking on behalf of the National Alliance for
the Mentally Ill.
   NAMI, a network of 70,000 families whose members have been
affected by mental illness, backs a $157 million 1990 budget
increase for the National Institute of Mental Health. The current
budget is $345 million.
   ``You're asking for $502 million. That's less than the cost of
one B-2 bomber,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, who heads the
subcommittee.
   ``If you want to make an impact this is the way to do it,'' said
Harkin as he accepted the petitions from Duke.
   Duke was the youngest actress to win an Academy Award when she
was named best actress in 1963 for her portrayal of the blind, deaf
and mute Helen Keller in the film version of ``The Miracle Worker.''

   Randy hikes her black spandex
miniskirt up a little further before stepping away from the doorway
and into the thick springtime rain falling on Purchase Street.
   No customers in sight.
   Gray and empty, it's a slow afternoon along the six-block
stretch of rundown storefronts and restaurants known as Weld
Square, a section of this old whaling port where the easy money is
in sex and drugs.
   The lure is strong enough to draw women like Randy onto the
streets, even as police continue a well-publicized hunt for a
serial killer who has found them such easy marks that he has
murdered at least nine in the past year, many of them single
mothers with drug habits. Two more women are missing.
   ``The girls are getting killed because they're easy to grab and
easy to lure into a car,'' said Mary, a former prostitute
struggling with a recent relapse into heroin addiction. ``And even
though they try to keep an eye on each other, there's no real
protection.''
   Big-city prostitution in crowded areas like New York's Times
Square offers protection that's missing in New Bedford.
   There are few pimps and no local by-the-hour hotels. The streets
are not busy with pedestrians.
   In New Bedford, prostitution is a business conducted away from
people, often in cars parked under railroad trestles or in shadowy
alleys.
   City Clerk Janis Davidian likened the Weld Square strip to a
shopping mall, where any stranger can take a highway off ramp to
easy sex.
   ``It's a small-town kind of prostitution, not sophisticated,''
she said. ``But anyone who is required by their job to get into
cars with strangers is certainly vulnerable.''
   Recent affidavits filed in a case against a New Bedford-area man
charged with several assaults paint a vivid picture of the dangers
the women face.
   Twelve prostitutes interviewed by state police provided
strikingly similar portraits of violence against them by the
26-year-old man, who appeared Friday in district court.
   They said he would pick them up in his truck and promise drugs
or money. He would take them to a cemetery and force them into sex.
He didn't pay and, to protect their business, the women didn't
complain to authorities until state police sought them out as part
of the serial killings investigation.
   ``Their relationship to drugs is what ties these women together.
Men turn to crime and women turn to prositution,'' said Debra
Robbin, director of the New Bedford Women's Center. ``It's a
survival tactic borne out of desperation. It's not a career
choice.''
   Norman, a general contractor and longtime resident of Weld
Square, says he has never been a customer but has watched his
sister-in-law and other friends turn to prostitution as they
wrestle powerful addictions to heroin and cocaine. ``You start out
selling a little and then you sell a little more,'' said Norman,
who like most other residents interviewed asked that his last name
not be used. ``Then all of a sudden all you've got left to sell is
yourself. That's when they become back-alley girls. If you can give
them 15 minutes and $20 then you've got a deal and they've got a
fix.''
   Mary, who said she straightened out six years ago after deciding
to go back to school and get a teaching degree, said drugs are what
push scores of prostitutes to endure constant threats and repeated
assaults.
   ``When somebody is sick from needing a fix, they are in a
tremendously vulnerable position,'' she said. ``All they need is
someone _ I don't care who it is _ to offer them a little bit of
dope, just a little bit.''

<TEXT>
   The parents of a 6-week-old girl whose body
was found in a trash barrel in Missouri are suspects in the death,
investigators said today.
   Robert and Paula Sims had told authorities the baby was abducted
much like another infant daughter three years ago who also was
found dead.
   ``The focus of the investigation is now leading to the
parents,'' said Detective Sgt. Rick McCain of the Alton Police
Department. ``An arrest is forthcoming.''
   But McCain did not say when an arrest might be made.
   He said the parents had never been ruled out as suspects because
of the similarities between Heather's disappearance and that of
their firstborn daughter, Loralei, in 1986.
   A thorough search late Thursday of the couple's home and two
vehicles, and the home of Mrs. Sims' mother, produced valuable
evidence, McCain said.
   Authorities broke windows to get into the Sims home in this town
several hours after an autopsy across the Mississippi River in West
Alton, Mo., confirmed the identity of the body found there.
   The Simses were not at home, but went to the Alton police
station to answer questions later Thursday, said West Alton Sgt.
Rick McCain.
   Police refused to say what they were looking for at the home.
   Dr. Mary Case, the St. Charles County medical examiner, would
not comment on Heather's cause of death, but said it was a homicide.
   At the old lock and dam, a popular spot for fishing and boating
30 miles north of St. Louis, at least two dozen federal, state and
local investigators, assisted by dogs, searched for evidence where
Heather's body was found.
   ``We really want to solve this case, that's all we're worried
about right now,'' said a sheriff's officer who helped seal off the
area and did not want to be identified. ``We've got a whole bunch
of people here because solving this case is our top priority.''
   A fisherman found the baby's body Wednesday night. He searched
the barrel and found the body in a plastic bag after he saw someone
acting suspiciously, said St. Charles County Sheriff Ed Uebinger.
   Uebinger refused to say whether the fisherman had been able to
describe the person seen near the barrel.
   The couple told police that a masked man approached Mrs. Sims
while she was taking out trash Saturday night, and that the gunman
forced her back into the home, knocked her unconscious and took the
infant. Sims said he was at work at the time.
   In June 1986, the Simses, who then lived in Brighton, Ill.,
reported to police that an armed intruder barged into their home _
again while Robert Sims was at work _ and took their 13-day-old
baby, Loralei.
   Loralei's remains were discovered a week later near the couple's
home. The cause of death never was determined and no one was
charged. Investigators have said the Simses were suspects, although
the couple denied any involvement in the baby's disappearance.
   The couple has a 15-month-old son.

<HEAD>Engine Production for FSX Is Unresolved</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARTON REPPERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese co-production of American-designed
jet engines is a ``viable alternative'' for the FSX fighter plane,
but the issue remains to be firmly resolved, Pentagon officials
told Congress Friday.
   The officials sought to assure a House panel, however, that
manufacturing technologies for critical engine components would not
be provided to Japan.
   Under the $7 billion FSX deal, St. Louis-based General Dynamics
and Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industry are to jointly co-develop and
co-produce a new fighter, based on the U.S. F-16, for deployment by
Japan in the late 1990s.
   Congressional critics have charged that the agreement amounts to
a ``giveaway'' of valuable advanced technology that may be used by
Japan to propel its own aircraft industry into head-to-head
competition with the United States. They say Japan instead should
buy American-made F-16s and help reduce the $55 billion trade
deficit with Japan.
   Resolutions of disapproval to try to stop the deal have been
introduced in the House and Senate. Even if the resolutions were
passed, however, it would require a two-thirds vote of both houses
to override a likely veto by President Bush.
   The engine issue arose at a hearing before the House Banking
subcommittee on economic stabilization, chaired by Rep. Mary Rose
Oakar, D-Ohio.
   Glenn A. Rudd, deputy director of the Pentagon's Defense
Security Assistance Agency, said jet engines for six FSX prototype
planes to be built under the development phase of the project would
be provided a U.S. manufacturer _ either Pratt &amp; Whitney or General
Electric.
   Oakar asked if the ``real goal'' of the Japanese was to
manufacture as many of the engines as possible in Japan when the
FSX goes into production about five years from now. Current plans
call for 130 aircraft to be built.
   Rudd replied: ``I think the Japanese certainly would have an
interest in licensed co-production under the production phase'' of
the project. He added: ``We have agreed with the Japanese orally
that that is a viable alternative.''
   The engine question will not be firmly decided, Rudd said, until
a separate U.S.-Japan memorandum of understanding is negotiated
covering the production phase.
   Another Defense Department official, Air Force Lt. Gen. Ronald
Yates, said that if co-production of the engines is undertaken, the
United States does not intend to transfer to Japan proprietary
manufacturing processes used for critical components.
   Asked whether the Japanese could simply copy the American
manufacturing technologies, Yates said: ``The metallurgy is in fact
not something that you can reverse-engineer.''
   In another development, Sen. John C. Danforth, R-Mo., renewed
his criticism of the Pentagon's role in negotiating the FSX deal
during the Reagan administration without consulting the Commerce
Department.
   After the Bush administration took office, Commerce Secretary
Robert Mosbacher expressed concern over economic implications of
the agreement, prompting Bush to send the deal back to Tokyo for
``clarifications'' on the U.S. share in the project and technology
transfer questions.
   Danforth said ``one thing in this whole mess is abundantly
clear: we must never go through such a flawed process again. My
concern is that we have zero assurance that this won't happen
again.''
   Danforth and Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., have introduced
legislation to require the Commerce Department to be an equal
partner in all agreements with other countries on the ``research,
development and production of defense equipment.''
   In testimony Wednesday before the House Foreign Affairs
Committee, Mosbacher said he is now satisfied with terms of the FSX
deal.

<HEAD>Red Cross En Route to Soviet Georgia to Help Gas Poisoning Victims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The International Committee of the Red Cross is
sending doctors to Soviet Georgia to treat victims of a powerful
gas used against pro-independence demonstrators last month, a
newspaper said Friday.
   The foreign doctors are being brought in because Soviet doctors
have been unable to determine effective treatment for the patients
injured in an April 9 clash.
   At least 19 people were killed when troops stormed the
demonstration with gas, shovels and armored personnel carriers. A
20th victim died when he was shot for violating a curfew imposed to
curb the unrest.
   Izvestia, the government daily, said the Red Cross delegation
was expected to arrive in the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, on Friday
to work with Georgian doctors at a hospital where the injured
demonstrators are being treated.
   But activist Sergei Dandurov said in a telephone interview from
Tbilisi that the delegation had not yet arrived.
   Soviet authorities have said a gas known in the West as CS was
used in the demonstration. It is an incapacitating agent whose
effects are similar to a nerve toxin.
   Dozens of people suffering problems with their nervous system,
vision, respiration and internal organs are still hospitalized, and
some have begun a hunger strike to press authorities to reveal more
about the effects of the gas and appropriate treatment.
   Human rights campaigner Andrei D. Sakharov traveled to Tbilisi
on Thursday and told reporters he supports Red Cross help,
according to Dandurov.
   Sakharov is part of a team of newly elected members of the new
Soviet parliament who are investigating the April 9 violence. He,
historian Dmitry Likhachev and space scientist Roald Sagdeyev
belong to an independent investigating commission.
   Izvestia said Sakharov and other commission members met Thursday
with Georgia's health minister, and Dandurov said they visited the
injured in a hospital on Friday.
   It is the second fact-finding trip Sakharov has made to a
nationalist hot spot in the Soviet Union. Last year, he visited
Yerevan, Armenia, to help mediate a dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh,
a part of neighboring Azerbaijan that Armenians claim is theirs.
   In another development, about 1,000 Georgian women gathered
Friday night outside Government House, the site of the bloody April
9 demonstration, to demand that authorities take stronger action to
treat gas poisoning victims, Dandurov said. They also demanded that
authorities free four Georgian activists arrested on charges of
organizing the protest.
   Georgian party chief Givi Gumbaridze told the protesters the
courts would decide the fate of the arrested activists, according
to Dandurov.
   The women demonstrators then marched to a hospital where the
victims are being treated and raised nationalist flags on the
building's balconies, he said.

   Vice President Dan Quayle returned to
Washington on Friday from a 12-day trip abroad and reported on the
journey to President Bush over lunch in the Oval Office.
   Details of their hour-long discussion were not revealed. Quayle
also spent some time in his office and left at mid-afternoon for
his residence.
   Earlier, Quayle said what he had learned on his 12-day trip to
Australia and Southeast Asia will help him influence policy in the
Bush administration.
   Quayle's first stop after traveling 41 hours was the White
House, where he had lunch with President Bush.
   Among the topics sure to be discussed were the oil spill in
Alaska's Prince William Sound, which Quayle visited Thursday. The
vice president toured an oil-drenched pebble beach on Smith Island,
talking with workers hired to wash stones.
   He told reporters at a midnight news conference at Elmendorf Air
Force Base near Anchorage that Bush has no plan to visit the
devastated area but is keenly interested in the situation.
   The administration's view is that ``those who are responsible
for it clean it up, and clean it up quickly,'' Quayle said. He was
accompanied on his tour by Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner
and Adm. Paul Yost, commandant of the Coast Guard.
   Exxon Corp., owner of the Exxon Valdez, the tanker that ran
aground on March 24, dumping 11 million gallons of crude into the
sound, has been criticized by Alaskan officials, who say the
company has failed to devote enough resources to the cleanup.
   The officials are also upset the Bush administration did not
respond fast enough to help in the crisis. The federal government
is now coordinating the cleanup effort, which is being paid for by
Exxon.
   But Quayle called Bush ``an environmentalist'' and added, ``This
president is not going to let anyone off the hook.''
   Asked if Exxon had done enough, Quayle said, ``Exxon is clearly
going to have to do more.''
   Quayle said that his trip to Australia, Indonesia, Thailand and
Singapore, his second foreign excursion since he became vice
president, was worthwhile because it gave him a feel for a number
of issues, including the situation in Cambodia, and allowed him to
make personal contact with leaders in those countries.
   He said he learned valuable information that will help him have
input into policy decisions in the Bush administration. ``I
guarantee you what I learned on the trip ... will help make
policy,'' he said.

<HEAD>Austrian Chancellor Says Bush Eastern Europe Trip `Very Welcome'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky said
Friday that President Bush's planned trip to Poland and Hungary was
a ``promising undertaking'' that could help efforts to dismantle
communism in Eastern Europe.
   Vranitzky said Bush had quizzed him about recent economic and
political reforms in Eastern Europe at a 45-minute White House
meeting. ``The president took a good deal of interest in our
assessment,'' he told reporters.
   Vranitzky said he and Bush ``agreed on the necessity that the
West should in a careful approach lend a helping hand to promote
the success'' of the Eastern European reforms.
   Bush intends to visit Austria's neighbor, Hungary, as well as
Poland in July to underscore U.S. support for the reforms.
   On April 17, Bush announced economic incentives to reward Poland
for steps taken toward democracy and to encourage further political
and economic reforms. The package included asking Congress to lower
tariffs on certain Polish imports and seeking congressional
approval of U.S.-guaranteed loans to stimulate private investment
in Poland.
   Austria, a neutral nation bordering the Soviet bloc, has been at
the forefront of encouraging reform in Eastern Europe. Bush's
visit, Vranitzky said, ``is a promising undertaking. If this visit
could lead to a deeper conviction on both sides that ending
communism should be a goal to be strived for, ... it is very
welcome from our point of view.''
   The chancellor, who heads Austria's Socialist Party and the
country's coalition government, said the removal this week of a
barbed wire fence on the Austrian-Hungarian border was ``a very
significant step'' signaling Hungary's intention to remove all
barriers between it and the West.
   Vranitzky said he had assured Bush that although Austria was
considering joining the 12-nation European Economic Community, this
``will not dilute her position of neutrality.''
   Under the 1955 State Treaty approved by the Soviet Union, the
United States, Britain and France, Austria vowed to maintain
neutrality to win the withdrawal of the allied forces which
occupied the country because of its association with Nazi Germany
in World War II.
   The chancellor told reporters that the necessary Austrian
political decisions will be made soon so that the EEC application
can be made ``in the course of this year, probably.''

   Delegates from 81 countries closed a
U.N. conference Friday with a pledge to end by the year 2000 the
production and use of chemicals that are rapidly destroying the
Earth's ozone layer.
   The Helsinki delegates, who represented most of the world's
population, also agreed to set up a system to help Third World
countries pay to replace equipment or Western-imported consumer
products that emit the chemicals. But they left open how much aid
will be involved, how the industrial countries will finance it, and
who will control it.
   Scientists at the four-day meeting said ozone was being lost
much more quickly than envisioned in 1987, when leading producers
of ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, agreed in Montreal
to cut emissions in half by 1999.
   However, Mostafa K. Tolba, director of the U.N. Environment
Program, told delegates in Helsinki that the situation represents
``an environmental time-bomb.''
   CFCs are most commonly used in refrigerators, air conditioners,
aerosols and cleaning materials for the metal and electronics
industries.
   When they rise into the atmosphere, they damage the ozone layer
15 to 25 miles up that blocks some of the sun's ultaviolet rays.
Scientists say the extra radiation increases cases of skin cancer
and eye disease and damages smaller plants and animals crucial to
the natural food chain.
   Delegates in Helsinki unanimously adopted their declaration to
phase out the production and consumption of CFCs worldwide by the
year 2000.
   Included in the accord was the United States, the world's
largest producer of CFCs. It makes nearly 40 percent of the
chemicals and consumes about 30 percent.
   The delegates also said they would phase out halons, which are
ozone-destroying gases used in sprinkler systems and fire
extinguishers. They gave no target date.
   Tolba told a news conference Friday that the Helsinki meeting
``exceeded all expectations'' and succeeded in a ``translation of
words into actions.''
   But the Helsinki Declaration does not become legally binding
unless it as adopted as an addendum to the Montreal Protocol. A
follow-up meeting is scheduled in London next spring.
   The delegates in Helsinki energetically debated proposals to set
up the fund to help the developing countries conform to treaty
requirements.
   Industrial countries argued that setting up a bureaucracy to
oversee the fund could waste money better spent on aid.
   Developing countries said they wanted assurances that the fund
would not take money from other aid projects like housing.
   Environmental groups, which were among more than 100 observers
at the closed meetings, charged that the declaration was
``purposely kept vague on all major points.''
   Representatives of Greenpeace said other hazardous chemicals
should have been added to five CFCs and three halons to be cut in
half under the Montreal pact.
   Scientists from industrial countries joined Greenpeace in
arguing that carbon tetrachloride and methyl chloroform, which are
used in solvents, should be blacklisted. They said the chemicals
have a much greater ozone-depleting potential than CFCs.
   Methyl chloroform is used in typewriter correction fluid.
   The two chemicals escaped the original ban because they are
short-lived once released into the air. CFCs have an atmospheric
life of up to 100 years.

   The U.S. Forest Service wants to appeal a
federal court injunction barring sales of nearly 1 billion board
feet of ancient timber in the national forests of the Northwest
where the spotted owl lives, according to a letter released by an
Oregon lawmaker Friday.
   Forest Service Chief F. Dale Robertson, in a letter to
Democratic Rep. Peter DeFazio, said he had ``requested that we
appeal the judge's injunction.''
   Robertson has formally asked the Agriculture Department's office
of general counsel to pursue the appeal, a Forest Service
spokeswoman said.
   Agriculture Department lawyers will review the request and make
a recommendation to the Department of Justice, which will make the
final decision on whether to appeal, said Dianne Hitchings
   Ms. Hitchings declined to release a copy of the request
Robertson had sent to Agriculture Department lawyers, adding that
such requests do not have to be made public.
   In March, U.S. District Judge William Dwyer in Seattle issued
the injuction in a suit involving challenges to the Forest
Service's spotted owl habitat management plan.
   Environmentalist charge the plan fails to set aside enough of
the region's old-growth forests to ensure the survival of the owl
and the timber industry has said that plan closes too many acres to
logging.
   Dwyer's injunction covered more than 140 sales representing
about one-fifth of the agency's planned sales program for this
fiscal year.
   The judge has set a trial for June 13.
   About 2,000 breeding pairs of owls are thought to live almost
exclusively in the old-growth forests of Oregon, Washington and
northern California. Their fate has touched off a raging dispute
between environmentalists and the region's timber industry.
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service last week proposed protecting
the owl as a threatened species.
   DeFazio was in a Alaska for a House Interior Committee hearing
on the Prince William Sound oil spill and had no comment on
Robertson's decision to seek an appeal.

   Israeli soldiers killed a 13-year-old
Palestinian in Bethlehem on Friday, and three Israeli soldiers were
wounded by a roadside bomb in south Lebanon.
   The boy's death raises to 461 the number of Palestinians killed
in the 17-month-old uprising against Israeli occupation of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip. Twenty Israelis also have been slain.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir told Jews who survived an Arab
knife attack that Israelis should make sure terrorists who assault
civilians do not escape unharmed. An opposition legislator accused
him of encouraging vigilantism.
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens rejected the French government
report on Palestine Liberation Organization chief Yasser Arafat's
meetings this week in Paris. Israel says the PLO is a terrorist
group and refuses to deal with it.
   An army spokesman said the boy was shot when he joined masked
youths who were throwing stones and iron bars at an army
observation post in Bethlehem, and arrived dead at an Arab hospital.
   He identified the victim as Mohammed Anton Shahin and said the
family took the body before army investigators could establish the
exact cause of death. The spokesman, who would not let his name be
used, said Shahin was arrested and freed on bail two weeks ago for
taking part in a demonstration.
   Arab reporters identified the boy as Milad Anton Shahin and said
he was building a roadblock when he was killed by a bullet to the
chest. Doctors at Mokassed Hospital in Jerusalem said he was taken
there and was pronounced dead on arrival.
   Shahin's family took the body and tried to hold a funeral
service in Manger Square, across from the Church of the Nativity,
but Israeli soldiers and police blocked the procession, the Arab
reporters said.
   They said the boy was buried in neighboring Beit Sahour village
and the funeral procession grew into a nationalist demonstration of
more than 500 marchers. Dozens of masked youths waved Palestinian
flags and shouted: ``With our blood and souls we shall redeem our
martyr!''
   Israel radio and Arab hospital sources said nine Palestinians
were wounded in clashes with soldiers Friday.
   In Lebanon, three wounded Israeli soldiers were evacuated by
helicopter to a hospital in northern Israel. One has moderate
injuries and two are lightly wounded, an army spokesman said on
condition of anonymity.
   He said the attack occurred on the edge of Israel's
self-proclaimed security zone, near the village of Aramta, 12 miles
north of Israel's border with Lebanon.
   A U.N. spokesman said Israeli artillery opened fire on militia
positions close to where the attack took place.
   The army refused to confirm the incident, but Israel radio
reported soldiers fired dozens of rounds.
   On Thursday, two members of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon
Army militia were killed by the detonation of a similar bomb near
Khiam village, four miles north of the Israeli border.
   Foreign reports say about 1,000 Israeli troops patrol the
six-to-10-mile-wide buffer strip that Israel carved out when it
withdrew the bulk of its forces from Lebanon in 1982. Israeli
patrols are assisted by the South Lebanon Army, a mostly Christian
force that Israel arms.
   Shamir on Friday visited two victims of a Wednesday stabbing
attack in which two elderly Jews were killed.
   ``I think the general public and the Jewish public must do their
utmost in order to defend themselves and in order to prevent
murderers from doing their deeds, and in order to prevent them from
coming out unscathed if they succeed in doing something,'' Shamir
said in remarks broadcast on radio stations.
   Legislator Haim Oron of the Socialist Mapam Party was quoted by
Israel radio as criticizing Shamir for calling on people to take
the law into their own hands.
   Shamir spokesman Avi Pazner said the comments were meant to
encourage cooperation with the police, not vigilante attacks.
   After Wednesday's attack, an Israeli crowd chased, caught and
beat the attacker, who was rescued by police.
   The assailant, Nidal Abdel Razak Zaloum of the West Bank town of
el-Bireh, appeared before a judge Friday and was ordered detained
for another two weeks.
   In Washington, the State Department said if the attack was
carried out by the Islamic Jihad in Palestine, as the group
claimed, then it was an act of terrorism.
   But Margaret Tutwiler, the department spokeswoman, also said
``the motivation for this brutal attack is unclear at this time.''
She said everyone ``interested in peace should condemn this act...
an outrageous act.''
   Ms. Tutwiler said the group was based primarily in Gaza and was
not part of the Palestine Liberation Organization.

   Indian activist Eddie Hatcher's attorney
said Friday that his client stands no chance of a fair trial if he
is extradited to North Carolina to faces charges of kidnapping 14
people at a newspaper office.
   Charles Garry told a news conference at the Hall of Justice that
he will fight efforts by Robeson County authorities to try Hatcher
on state charges of kidnapping. Garry said racism is rampant in the
mostly rural North Carolina county, which has roughly equal numbers
of whites, blacks and Indians.
   Hatcher, 31, appeared briefly in San Francisco Municipal Court
but was ordered to return May 23 after Garry has a chance to review
case documents and decide whether to pursue an appellate court stay
of Hatcher's extradition or request a full hearing before
California Gov. George Deukmejian. Garry officially joined the case
Friday morning.
   Hatcher and fellow Tuscarora Indian Timothy Jacobs were accused
of holding hostages for 10 hours in the offices of The Robesonian
Newspaper in Lumberton, N.C., in February 1988. They said they were
trying to draw attention to involvement by local law enforcement
officials in drug trafficking.
   The two were tried and acquitted on federal charges but later
charged by the state. Garry said the state charges constitute
double jeopardy.
   Jacobs pleaded guilty Thursday to all 14 charges. He was
sentenced to six years in prison, followed by a six-year suspended
sentence and up to five years of probation.
   Hatcher was arrested in San Francisco March 10 after
unsuccessfully seeking asylum at the Soviet Consulate. His bail has
been set at $1 million.
   Garry, who defended Black Panthers Bobby Seal and Huey Newton
and wrote the book ``Streetfighter in the Courtroom,'' said he
would appeal to the governor's ``compassionate side and see if it
works,'' as well as his ``Armenian sense of justice.''
   The latter was a reference to Armenia's history of genocide and
racism at the hands of greater powers. Deukmejian is of Armenian
descent and Garry was born in Massachusetts to Armenian immigrants
named Garabedian.
   The attorney said he would present ``ample, reliable evidence''
of the alleged racism in Robeson County.
   ``The governor of California could do us a great justice by
keeping Eddie Hatcher here,'' said the Rev. Leon White of North
Carolina as he flanked Garry.
   Hatcher's mother, Thelma Clark of Pembroke, N.C., attended the
hearing and news conference, wearing a gray suit and white banner
with red letters that read, ``Eddie Hatcher is my son.''
   ``If the governor of California sends my son back, he might as
well hold a gun to his head and pull the trigger,'' she said.
   The Rev. Ben Chavis, a San Francisco State University professor
and executive director of the United Church of Christ Commission
for Racial Justice in Washington, D.C., said the commission will
lobby with the public on Hatcher's behalf.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Reforms in FBI Promotion System; Declines to Order Quotas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WENDY E. LANE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EL PASO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Friday ordered the FBI
to reorganize what he called an ``excessively subjective''
promotion system that resulted in discrimination against Hispanic
agents.
   But U.S. District Judge Lucius Bunton refused to make the agency
adopt ethnic promotion quotas, saying the FBI can take other steps
to make sure Hispanics get the experience they need for career
advancement.
   ``The imposition of quotas or preferential promotion are drastic
remedies which should be ordered only upon a showing that the
discriminating employer has resisted less intrusive reforms,''
Bunton said, ruling on a discrimination suit brought by 311
Hispanic agents.
   Up to 200 Hispanic agents could be eligible for promotion under
the ordered reforms. And federal officials have said Bunton's order
could affect how other U.S. law enforcement agencies promote and
assign employees.
   The judge also reinforced the power of the FBI's national career
board and stripped local FBI agents-in-charge of the power to
override board decisions.
   Bernardo M. ``Mat'' Perez of El Paso, who filed the lawsuit in
1987, hailed Bunton's order as the end of an arbitrary and unfair
system of promotion.
   ``We have cracked the case,'' said Perez, the FBI's
highest-ranking Hispanic agent. ``We have broken the good old boy
network. Today it (a fairer system) is going to start.''
   Bunton rejected the agents' request for back pay and extra
compensation for tedious duties they do disproportionately, such as
listening to Spanish-language wiretaps.
   However, plaintiffs' attorney Antonio Silva stressed that the
plaintiffs weren't after money.
   ``All of the agents have told me that if it was one cent or $10
million, they would trade it all to stop discrimination within the
FBI,'' Silva said. ``What we were after in this case was the
rightful place of these agents and to eradicate discrimination, and
we believe the judge has done that.
   ``What the judge has done is change the bureau in a way that
will benefit all agents. It makes the bureau a better place for
everyone _ male, female _ regardless of ethnicity.''
   ``We are looking with care at Judge Bunton's ruling with an eye
toward building further on the many improvements already undertaken
in the FBI's personnel practices,'' FBI Director William S.
Sessions said in a statement.
   The judge acknowledged that the FBI has ``taken significant
steps'' to curb discrimination since his initial ruling against it
in September, but said they were not enough.
   Among the reforms Bunton ordered is appointment of a
three-member panel to review plaintiffs' claims that they were
denied promotions because of discrimination.
   Of the agents who joined the suit, 200 are eligible for the
special promotion review, based on thir seniority and career
status. Hispanics make up less than 5 percent of the FBI's 9,000
agents.
   The FBI also must record and transcribe proceedings of its
career board, a standing body that evaluates promotions.
   In stripping FBI agents-in-charge of the ability to disregard
career board recommendations, the judge called the practice an
``anathema to nearly every reform advanced by the bureau.''
   The agency must ``improve the fairness and reviewability of an
excessively subjective promotional process,'' he said.
   Perez filed the suit after a series of demotions dropped him
from agent-in-charge in San Juan, Puerto Rico, to the No. 2 spot in
El Paso. He claimed the demotions were based on his ethnic
heritage, while the FBI cited investigative and administrative
problems.
   Bunton ordered Perez promoted to the next job level in the
bureau within 45 days and said Sessions must report to the court
every 90 days on promotional decisions regarding Perez until the
agent becomes an agent-in-charge or is named to a job with similar
responsibilities.

<TEXT>
   Americans took out $5.37 billion more in
consumer debt than they paid off in March, roughly matching
February's rate of growth despite a big dropoff in borrowing for
cars, the government reported Friday.
   The Federal Reserve Board said consumer credit increased at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 9.4 percent in March, off
slightly from the revised 9.5 percent pace of advance in February.
   For all of 1988, consumer credit increased 8.5 percent.
   Consumer spending is closely monitored as a gauge of the
economy's health because it represents two-thirds of all economic
activity. The economy has showed signs of slowing in recent months
in response to a campaign by the Federal Reserve Board to restrain
growth and ease inflationary pressures by pushing up interest rates.
   Economist Cynthia Latta of Data Resources Inc. in Lexington,
Mass., said the strong credit figures were at odds with a stream of
government reports pointing toward a slowdown, and didn't
accurately reflect the health of economy.
   Car loans, heavily affected by rising interest rates, grew by
$953 million in March, a 4 percent annual rate of growth. That was
down sharply from growth of $2.39 billion in February, when the
annual growth rate was 10 percent.
   Auto sales have been weak this year as business dropped off
under the weight of higher interest rates and slackening demand
after earlier strong sales. Automakers in recent weeks have
launched a new round of incentives in hopes of luring customers
back into showrooms for the crucial spring selling season.
   The category of debt that includes credit cards surged by $4.3
billion in March, a strong 28.9 percent annual rate of increase, up
from a 12.6 percent pace in the previous month. Ms. Latta said the
figure was not to be trusted, given another government report
showing retail sales rose just 0.1 percent in March and other signs
that consumer spending is slowing down.
   Bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate rose by
$1.78 billion in March, an 11 percent rate of growth, up from a 7.3
percent rate of advance in February.
   Mobile home debts, meanwhile, dropped $1.67 billion, a huge 76.9
percent annual rate of decline. Analysts said the decrease
reflected a shift of debt into the category of bank loans rather
than an actual dropoff in borrowing for mobile homes.
   The various changes left total consumer debt at a seasonally
adjusted $692.77 billion in March.

   President Bush is standing by his appointments
of Donald Gregg and John Negroponte to key ambassadorships despite
congressional roadblocks over questions about their roles in the
Iran-Contra affair, the White House said Friday.
   ``The president feels both of those nominations are very
important to carrying out the policies of the government in the
areas in which he has asked them to serve. He is very proud of both
appointments and thinks they are outstanding men who should be
confirmed,'' said White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   Gregg, who was Bush's national security adviser when Bush was
vice president, has been nominated as ambassador to South Korea.
Negroponte, Honduran ambassador when Bush was vice president, has
been tapped as the Bush administration's emissary to Mexico.
   Negroponte attended a White House celebration of Cinco de Mayo,
a Mexican holiday, and was warmly introduced by the president as
the next ambassador.
   Fitzwater also told reporters the president has not discussed
the question of whether to pardon Oliver North after the former
White House aide's conviction Thursday on three felony counts in
connection with the Iran-Contra case.
   In the past, Bush has called North a hero and said he hoped the
former Marine officer would be acquitted.
   Fitzwater refused any further comment on the North verdict or
trial documents that suggested Bush was involved in a Reagan
administration plan to make a quid-pro-quo arrangement with
Honduras in return for its assistance to the Contra rebels in
Nicaragua.
   But when asked if trial documents, which have caused some
lawmakers to express reservations about Negroponte and Gregg, might
influence Bush to back away from the nominations, Fitzwater
indicated that would not be the case.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Asia subcommittee, is said to have asked Secretary of
State James A. Baker III to reconsider Gregg's nomination because
trial materials raised doubts about Gregg's past assertions that he
did nothing illegal or improper in his contacts with North and
other Iran-contra figures.
   Gregg's relationship with Felix Rodriguez, a key figure in
North's private aid network to help the Contras during the
congressional ban on aid, was a controversial topic throughout the
Iran-Contra investigations. Gregg has repeatedly bolstered Bush's
assertion that as vice president he did not know the extent of
North's clandestine efforts.
   Gregg's confirmation hearing is scheduled for next week.
   The Foreign Relations Committee delayed a vote on Negroponte's
nomination last month after some Democratic senators requested more
time to review whether as ambassador to Honduras he was involved in
a quid pro quo arrangement to entice Honduras to help the rebels.
   John Sununu, Bush's chief of staff, has cited a cable from
Negroponte as proof that Bush did not engage in a discussion of
such arrangements for the Contras when he met with Honduran
President Roberto Suazo in early 1985.
   Fitzwater said the appropriate congressional committees would be
briefed on confidential cables that described Bush's activities in
that regard.
   Bush on Thursday denied being involved in any quid pro quo
arrangement nd denied knowing of any such effort by others in the
administration.
   Documents from the North trial had Bush and Suazo meeting at a
time when internal Reagan administration memos suggested a plan in
which continuing U.S. aid to Latin American countries would be
linked to assistance for the rebels.
   The document never asserted that Bush discussed a quid pro quo
arrangement with Suazo. But it said he explained to the Hondurans
that they were to receive a great deal more U.S. economic and other
aid _ aid that the document said was part of a deal approved by
then-President Reagan.

   The investigation of New York's commodity
exchanges is narrower than a probe of Chicago futures markets but
focuses on fundamental trading practices common to both operations,
officials said Friday.
   Federal agents raided the headquarters of four futures markets
in lower Manhattan on Thursday, seizing documents from at least one
firm, subpoenaing traders and sending shudders through the frenetic
trading pits.
   But officials close to the investigations by the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission and Manhattan U.S attorney's office said
they were focusing on allegations of price fixing and other
practices by a few individual traders and not the exchanges at
large.
   They said the FBI was not involved, unlike a separate two-year
undercover probe in Chicago where agents infiltrated commodities
pits and secretly tape-recorded traders.
   ``It's not something that hits out at you and goes boom, boom,
boom,'' one market official who asked not to be named said of the
trading practices being studied in New York.
   The CFTC, which regulates U.S. commodity markets, subpoenaed
trading and broker records from the New York Commodity Exchange,
the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, the New York Mercantile
Exchange and the New York Cotton Exchange, plus at least six
individual traders.
   The CFTC's civil probe is examining activities of more than 50
traders over the past two years. An official said the subpoenas
request information detailing disciplinary action, personal bank
accounts and about leasing expensive and hard-to-get memberships to
non-members.
   The U.S. Postal Service executed two criminal search warrants at
the offices of MBF Clearing Corp., headed by Mark B. Fisher, a
prominent trader on all four exchanges who was disciplined in 1985
for trading violations.
   ``I'd say he (Fisher) is one of the focuses of it. We're
certainly not limiting the case to just him,'' said Postal Service
Inspector Jack Ellis.
   Melvin A. Brosterman, Fisher's attorney, said his client was
cooperating with the government and had done nothing wrong.
   Officials confirmed reports that the scrutiny included
pre-arranged trading, in which dealers agree to fix prices
beforehand, and trades conducted to skirt tax losses or defer
income.
   Critics consider the futures markets prone to fraudulent
activity partly because of the volatile, split-second atmosphere in
which trading is conducted. Screaming traders wearing brightly
colored coats use hand signals and shouts to coordinate buying and
selling of futures contracts on commodities from oil to orange
juice. Dealers and investors make money by speculating on the
future prices of the commodities.
   Other violations may have occurred in a practice known as
``front-running,'' whereby traders execute trades for their own
accounts before those of customers.
   Traders legally are allowed to trade for both themselves and
their customers but that practice, known as dual trading, has been
widely criticized as a possible source of abuses.
   While no indictments have been announced, the criminal probe of
the Chicago markets, which are the nation's largest, reportedly has
involved more than 200 subpoenas and threats of racketeering
prosecutions.
   In New York, meanwhile, exchange seats were selling for about
$335,000 Friday on the Merc after plunging from $350,000 to as
little as $285,000 Thursday after the probe was disclosed. Analysts
said a similar pattern followed news in January of the Chicago
probe, and seats there now are selling at record highs.

   West Germany opposes a plan that would
require NATO to decide soon whether to modernize tactical nuclear
weapons in Europe, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said
Friday.
   The plan by the Canadian government is a compromise aimed at
breaking a NATO deadlock that has pitted West Germany against the
United States and Britain.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl, whose support at home is rapidly
eroding, is insisting that the superpowers hold talks soon on
reducing short-range nuclear weapons in Europe, most of which are
based in West Germany.
   West Germany also wants NATO to postpone until 1992 whether to
modernize the missile fleet to give the rockets greater range.
   Kohl had a 30-minute telephone conversation with President Bush
on Friday. The two leaders discussed the NATO rift, but U.S.
opposition to early talks on the missiles remains firm, White House
press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said.
   ``We still believe early talks would be a mistake,'' Fitzwater
said. ``Discussions that would lead to a ... denuclearization of
Europe would not be welcome.''
   Fitzwater said the telephone conversation was initiated by Kohl.
He would not give further details.
   Canada has proposed that West Germany agree to the modernization
and that Washington in turn show its willingness to take up
negotiations on short-range weapons with the Soviet Union.
   Genscher, asked his view of that idea during an interview with
Deutschlandfunk radio, said West Germany's position ``is that a
decision not be moved up on whether or not we need a replacement
(for the missiles) but that it be made at the right point in time,
namely 1992.''
   A government official insisted that Genscher did not mean West
Germany was rejecting any proposed solutions to the NATO feud.
   ``This has been stated before, that we don't think there should
be a decision on replacing the missiles before it is necessary,''
said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonyity.
   He said the government would not be giving its official position
on any suggested compromises, but they would be discussed privately
among the NATO partners.
   ``Discussions are already under way (within NATO), and every
proposal will be examined. Anything is possible,'' said the
official.
   The United States and Britain say taking up negotiations on
short-range nuclear weapons now could leave the West vulnerable to
the superior conventional forces of the Warsaw Pact.
   Both nations say they want to see more progress on reducing
conventional weapons during talks being held in Vienna.
   West Germany says NATO should not pass up opportunities to hold
talks with the Warsaw Pact bloc on any weapons systems, and that
the time is right to begin negotiations on short-range nuclear
weapons.
   The West Germans also say no decision is necessary on replacing
the Lance missiles until 1992 because the rockets are not yet out
of date.
   Most of NATO's 88 Lance missile launchers are based in West
Germany, and Genscher has repeatedly stressed that his country
should have a ``special weight'' in alliance discussions about the
future of those arsenals.
   In Rome, meanwhile, the Cabinet of Premier Ciriaco De Mita on
Friday endorsed the government's support for negotiations on
short-range nuclear weapons if there is significant progress in
East-West talks on conventional forces.
   Italy generally sides with West Germany in the NATO dispute,
giving its qualified support for talks to reduce the weapons and
saying it does not believe there is an urgent need to modernize the
weapons. West Germany says nearly half of the 16 NATO members
support its position.
   Kohl and De Mita met Wednesday in Rome to discuss the issue.

<TEXT>
   Nelson Mandela urged South
Africans to work for peace among themselves, said a colleague who
was allowed to visit the imprisoned black leader for five hours
Friday.
   Harry Gwala, terminally ill with a neurological disease, was
accompanied by his lawyer and a friend to see Mandela at the Victor
Verster prison farm outside Cape Town. He would not reveal who
initiated the meeting or give details, but he said part of the
conversation was about violence in Natal province.
   A senior Cabinet minister said Friday the government wants to
bring South Africa's black majority into Parliament and the
executive branch, but on condition that the white minority cannot
be overruled.
   Security for the 5 million whites can be ensured ``only in an
environment of progress, safety and justice for all the people of
South Africa,'' Chris Heunis, constitutional development minister,
said in a speech to Parliament.
   South Africa's 28 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs.
   Gwala, who lives in Natal, said Mandela gave him a message
saying South Africans should ``try and strive for peace among
themselves and to keep up their determination to bring about a new
South Africa.''
   He and Mandela, both 70, have been members of the African
National Congress since the 1940s. Until Gwala's release in
November, both were serving life sentences on convictions stemming
from their involvement with the outlawed guerrilla movement.
   Friday's meeting was their first since 1982, when Mandela was
moved from Robben Island prison to the Pollsmoor penitentiary.
Gwala told journalists he had not expected to see Mandela again
because ``we were doing life. We only had hope that we would see
each other in a free country.''
   Mandela apparently does not entertain hopes of beeing released
soon, Gwala said, but ``he seemed in good health. From what we had
heard he was very much improved.'' He said Mandela wore civilian
clothes and no guards observed their meeting.
   The Heunis speech in Parliament was a summary of proposals he
and other government officials have mentioned in recent months. He
said details of a new constitutional system must be negotiated and
offered few specifics of the new role envisioned for blacks.
   No black leaders have accepted the government's invitation to
constitutional negotiations. Militant blacks have rejected plans
put forth by Heunis, but some moderates have indicated they would
negotiate if the government freed Mandela, among others, and lifted
bans on black opposition groups.
   Speculation that Mandela would be freed after the Sept. 6
general elections increased with the Gwala visit. Previous efforts
to win his release have been blocked by the nationalist leader's
refusal to renounce violence in the campaign for majority rule.

<TEXT>
   Pakistan accused Afghanistan of
hitting it with a missile, and the communist Kabul government
countercharged on Friday that Islamabad and Washington were
preparing a chemical attack on an Afghan city.
   The official newspaper, The Pakistan Times, said Friday that the
Foreign Ministry summoned the Afghan charge d'affaires to protest
that a Soviet-made SS-1 Scud missile hit a refugee camp inside
Pakistan on Thursday, killing two people and wounding 14.
   However, local officials and witnesses said the blast was caused
by a bomb dropped by one of two Afghan warplanes that flew about 70
miles into Pakistan's North West Frontier province.
   No explanation was made for the discrepancy.
   Pakistan and the United States are major backers of Afghan
Moslem rebels who for the past 11 years have fought to topple the
Soviet-backed Kabul regime and establish an Islamic government.
   In Kabul, the government denied the allegation and called it a
plot by Pakistan to divert attention from the ``military aggression
and internal interference in Afghanistan.''
   An Afghan Foreign Ministry spokesman deflected U.S. and rebel
charges that communist troops were getting ready to use chemical
weapons against guerrillas besieging the eastern city of Jalalabad.
He said in a statement broadcast over official Radio Kabul that
instead, the United States and Pakistan were giving such
internationally outlawed weapons to the guerrillas.
   The statement said Kabul was ready to welcome United Nations
experts ``in order to assess these baseless allegations. ... The
Republic of Afghanistan has acquired no chemical weapons of any
type whatsoever. It does not, and will not seek to obtain such
weapons, the use of which it considers a crime against humanity.''
   Rebel commanders and some U.S. officials in Washington have
reported that troops defending Jalalabad recently received gas
masks and protective garb in preparation for the use of chemical
weapons against the insurgents.
   The guerrillas have been attacking Jalalabad, 42 miles from the
Pakistan border, since March 6.
   Soviet forces ended nine years of military intervention on the
Kabul side on Feb. 15.
   The guerrillas reportedly are preparing new offensives around
Afghanistan after Ramadan, the Moslem holy month of fasting, which
ends next week.

   Pirates attacked and set fire to a
wooden boat carrying Vietnamese refugees, massacring about 130
people in a rampage of rape, gunfire, and clubbings, refugee
officials said Friday.
   They said the attack took place in the South China Sea off the
Malaysian coast on April 16, according to the only known survivor,
who was piced up by another refugee boat after he floated for 29
hours.
   ``It is one of the worst incidents of piracy we have heard of,''
said Jean Marie Fakhouri, the U.N. high commissioner for refugees
in Kuala Lumpur.
   Such attacks on refugees fleeing Vietnam have increased in
number and viciousness recently. Two attacks in March left more
than 100 people missing and presumed dead.
   Western officials say most pirates are Thais who roam the South
China Sea, the Gulf of Thailand and waters near Indonesia.
   In the latest violence, seven pirates armed with shotguns and
hammers stormed the refugees' boat, raped several women and
attacked people, said the U.N. official in a telephone interview.
   Some of the boat people died of exhaustion after floating in the
sea clinging to dead bodies of fellow refugees, said the official.
   The 22-year-old man who survived the April attack was identified
as Pham Ngoc Minh Hung by refugee officials who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   He fled Vietnam April 14 on a motorized wooden boat with about
130 refugees, including 20 children, said a statement issued by the
commission.
   Pirates from two boats boarded the refugee boat, shot and killed
the vessel's two pilots and its mechanic and raped some, if not
all, of the 15-20 women and girls as young as 12, the statement
said.
   Then the pirates set the boat ablaze. ``In the ensuing panic,
many refugees grabbed buoys and jerrycans and floats and plunged
into the sea.''
   The pirates ``used sticks to prevent refugees from clinging on
floating objects. Those who resisted were shot at.''
   Pham swam away from his boat, followed by another refugee who
later lagged behind, according to the statement. About four hours
later, Pham was swept back toward the refugee boat by ocean
currents, it said.
   ``He met a woman who was holding on to two dead bodies in order
to keep afloat. They then tied three dead bodies together with
clothing to make a raft,'' it said. ``The woman held on to the raft
while the witness clung to another dead body. They spent the night
in this manner while the two pirate boats were still in close
vicinity.''
   The pair reportedly heard shouts around them during the night
but could not locate other survivors. The next morning, they
spotted a boy 12 or 13 years old clinging to a jerrycan.
   ``His jerrycan was later snatched away by another adult
refugee,'' Pham's account said. ``The witness passed a floating
dead body to the boy to help him float but the boy died of
exhaustion 10 minutes later.''
   The pirate boats lingered several hours and Pham and the woman
decided to swim away. But the woman was too exhausted and fell
behind.
   Pham kept swimming, supporting himself on two wooden planks, and
was rescued on the afternoon of April 17 by another refugee boat,
according to the statement.
   They circled the scene of the attack and found debris and
luggage floating, but no other survivors.

   Japan's foreign minister ended talks with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other officials Friday without
making any progress on a bitter dispute over the Kuril Islands.
   ``The northern territories have always belonged to Japan
alone,'' Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno told a news conference.
   ``Russians are entitled to believe they are entirely Russian,''
said Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Rogachev, who addressed
reporters after Uno.
   Completion of a peace treaty formally ending World War II
hostilities between the two countries and a visit by Gorbachev to
Japan both depend on resolution of the crisis.
   The Soviet Union occupied the islands north of Hokkaido after
the end of fighting in 1945 and have rejected Japanese demands to
give them back. Both sides claim the islands belong to them
historically and culturally.
   Gorbachev told Uno that Japan was using a double standard in
pressing for the islands. In remarks carried by the Tass news
agency, the Kremlin chief asked why Japan doesn't consider that its
similar claims to China and South Korea are obstacles to full-scale
relations with those countries.
   ``There must be no room for a lopsided attitude to sovereign
interests of states and the existing views of a people on some or
other aspects of its relations with other peoples,'' Gorbachev
said. ``Mutually observed balancing of interests is very important
in bilateral relations. And it is also important to avoid
ultimatums in posing some or other questions.''
   The Soviet Union is improving relations with China, opening
avenues to South Korea and seeking to boost its trade with the
booming economies of the Pacific Rim. Many Japanese companies have
operated for years in the Soviet Union.
   The Soviets have pledged to remove 200,000 soldiers from the
Pacific region as part of an overall reduction of their military
force worldwide.
   Gorbachev also blasted Japan for building up its military
potential at a time when the Soviet Union is pursuing disarmament.
   Officials in Japan are pressing for a Gorbachev visit after the
Kuril Islands issue is settled, but Rogachev said the Soviets
insist ``there must be no preconditions on either side.''
   ``The visit of Mikhail Gorbachev is on the political agenda and
it will all depend on how we advance in our preparatory work,''
Rogachev said.
   The Soviet president, in the remarks carried by Tass, said a
visit to Japan should be discussed early next year.
   Gorbachev's schedule this year is full, with a trip to Peking
for the first Soviet-Chinese summit in 30 years scheduled next
week, a trip to West Germany in June, to France in July, and to
Finland and Italy in fall.
   Uno said he would meet once again with Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze at the United Nations in September, and that
he was confident the two sides eventually could work out an
agreement.
   But he acknowledged that besides stepping up the work of a joint
commission on the problem, neither side had tabled any compromise
proposals during his visit to the Soviet Union, which began April
30.
   Rogachev said the Soviets were disappointed in Uno's reaction to
their proposal to begin Soviet-U.S.-Japanese talks on disarmament
in the Pacific region.
   He said his country views such talks as a starting point for a
broader disarmament discussion such as the one encompassing the
NATO and Warsaw Pact countries in Europe.
   But Uno said modernization and increases in Soviet military
forces ``makes us very apprehensive,'' and that ``U.S. forces exist
as a means of contributing to the stability of the region.''

   A juror in the Oliver North trial said Friday
she had been using cocaine until ``three or four months'' before
the trial, but she said it did not affect her work as a juror.
   ``That was months ago, months before I got on this trial,'' said
Tara King, 35, in a telephone interview.
   She first commented on her past drug use in an interview on WJLA
television in Washington.
   ``They asked me about it, and I told the truth,'' said Miss King.
   She told The AP she had used cocaine about once a week but never
had a drug habit and had never been arrested for drug use or taken
any treatment for it. She said that she did not use any illegal
drugs during the trial and that her former drug use had no impact
on her during jury deliberations.
   Miss King said she did not tell the trial judge, Gerhard A.
Gesell, about her previous use of drugs because ``he didn't ask
me.''
   ``That had nothing to do with me going to jury duty,'' she said.
   Asked during the television interview, how she was able to stop
using drugs, she said, ``I said my prayers to the good Lord.''

   President Bush's spokesman turned away
questions Friday about a pardon for Oliver North as jurors began to
recount their thoughts after convicting North on three of 12
Iran-Contra felony charges.
   Of four jurors who commented publicly, three said North should
go to prison for the crimes. One said, ``That's not for me to say.''
   Jury foreman Denise Anderson said she believed North got a fair
trial, but she also said former President Reagan ``should have been
down there'' to testify ``because he knew a lot about what was
going on.''
   Asked if Bush should have been compelled to testify, she added,
``Yes, I'm not leaving him out.''
   North's lawyers unsuccessfully sought subpoenas for both Reagan
and for Bush, who was vice president at the time of the events
covered in the trial.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell will sentence North on June
23, with maximum possible penalties of 10 years in prison and
$750,000 in fines.
   Bush spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, responding to questions on the
subject of a pardon, said he had asked the president about it on
Thursday.
   ``He said `I haven't discussed it with anybody,''' the White
House press secretary said.
   Pressed by reporters, Fitzwater said, ``We don't want to
speculate either way. ... There's been no discussion of a pardon
whatsoever.''
   Bush had in the past said that North, a decorated Vietnam
veteran, was a hero and had said he hoped the former White House
aide would be acquitted. But the president has repeatedly said he
has not discussed the possibility of a pardon, and he showed
irritation recently at a published report speculating on what he
might do.
   Fitzwater also said Bush preferred ``not to have any comment at
this time'' on the verdicts.
   Documents in the trial suggested a bigger role for Bush than
earlier revealed concerning the solicitation of other countries'
support for the Contras. But Bush, who visited Honduras' president
in early 1985, declared Thursday the meeting had not been part of
any deal to provide Honduras with expedited U.S. aid in return for
help for the rebels.
   North, out of the public eye on Friday, said Thursday he would
appeal and was confident of eventual vindication.
   Meanwhile, most of the jurors rested in private after the
three-month trial and 12 days of deliberations. But four commented:
   _Ms. Anderson, the 34-year-old foreman, said she saw the
Iran-Contra issue as a political dispute, ``a war between the
Democrats and the Republicans.'' And when asked if North had
``taken the heat'' for higher-ups, she said, ``That's my
impression.'' But when asked if North should go to prison, she
said, ``I think he should do some time.''
   She said she was glad for North's sake that in court ``he got up
there and said something for himself.'' But she said he ``didn't
really impress me that much.'' And she said she found the testimony
of North's former secretary, Fawn Hall, ``phony. ... I just did not
appreciate her crying _ the way it seemed she had everything set
up.''
   _Earl F. Williams, 65, who served with General George Patton's
3rd Army during World War II, expressed sympathy for North, a
former Marine who served on the National Security Council staff in
the Reagan White House. ``I think in my heart that he thought he
was doing the right thing,'' Williams said. ``And I think there
were people higher who gave him authority to do a lot of things and
then when he got caught out there high and dry, no one came to help
him.''
   At first he said it was ``not for me to say'' if North should go
to prison. But when pressed, he said, ``I feel that if he's guilty
he should go to jail, which he is, so. ...''
   _Tara King, 35, said she helped persuade fellow jurors who
wanted to acquit North on all counts that they could not find him
innocent of actions he had admitted. ``You got it from word of
mouth that he knew it was against the law,'' she said. And she said
he should serve time in prison.
   Yet, when asked if she considered North a hero, Miss King said,
``Yes, in some sense. He fought in the war. He tried to save
hostages. He put himself out there.''
   Later Friday, she said that she had been using cocaine until
``three or four months'' before the trial but that it did not
affect her work as a juror. ``That was months ago, months before I
got on this trial,'' she said in a telephone interview after first
discussing her past drug use on WJLA television in Washington.
   _Ernest Nelson, 29, an electronics technician, said he doubted
that all the facts in the Iran-Contra affair would ever come out
and because ``a lot of lives were involved ... in some cases it's
probably best that it is kept that way.''
   Asked if North should go to prison, he said, ``That's not for me
to say.''
   Ms. Anderson, Miss King and Williams spoke at their homes. Ms.
Anderson also was interviewed by CNN as was Nelson.
   The jury found North guilty of accepting a $13,800 home security
system from retired Maj. Gen. Richard Secord, a co-defendant whom
North had hired to run arms to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
   In addition, the jurors convicted North of destroying, altering
or removing documents from the NSC. North said former National
Security Adviser Robert McFarlane told him to alter memos, but
McFarlane testified that North suggested the alteration.
   The jurors also found North guilty of aiding and abetting
obstruction of Congress in November 1986 through the preparation of
a false chronology regarding the arms shipments to Iran that
engulfed the White House in controversy during former President
Reagan's second term.

   President Bush has decided to name Everett
Ellis Briggs, now U.S. ambassador to Honduras, as the senior
National Security Council aide for Latin America, an administration
source said Friday.
   In the job, Briggs who has held several foreign postings, would
be the chief White House official on a number of key foreign policy
issues, including the Contra question in Nicaragua, U.S. relations
with Panama and military support for Latin democracies such as El
Salvador and Guatemala.
   The NSC position, with the title of senior director, does not
require congressional confirmation. Briggs appointment was
confirmed by a source who declined to be identified.
   Briggs has been ambassador to Panama from 1982 to 1986 and was
the deputy assistant secretary of state for Inter-American Affairs
from 1981 to 1982. In that State Department post, he had a hand in
shaping the Reagan administration's Central America policies.
   He has also held diplomatic posts in Bolivia, West Germany,
Portugal, Angola, Paraguay and Colombia.
   In his early days in Panama, Briggs was embroiled in controversy
when he accused by the National Guard commander of using his
diplomatic assignment to conduct spying activities and of
interfering with the country's internal affairs. U.S. officials
denied those charges.
   Briggs was appointed by then-President Reagan to the Honduras
post in the fall of 1986, serving there during the time when
disclosures came out about the Reagan administration's clandestine
efforts to aid the Contra rebels during the congressional ban on
aid.
   Relations with the Hondurans were a key factor in the private
Contra aid operation, with the Contras using Honduras as a base of
operations.
   The Bush administration has adopted a non-military approach to
the Contra issue, giving the rebel forces non-lethal aid until next
February when elections will be held in Nicaragua.
   The Contra army is encamped in Honduras near the Nicaraguan
border and the U.S. aid is to be released also for repatriation for
those who want to return to their homeland.

<HEAD>U.S. Troops in Philippines To Avoid Conflict with Rebels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The military said Friday that it
seized communist rebel documents apparently calling for more
killings of U.S. military officials starting in June, the state-run
Philippines News Agency reported.
   The rebels killed U.S. Army Col. James ``Nick'' Rowe on April 21
as he was riding to work at the headquarters of the Joint U.S.
Military Assistance Group.
   The New People's Army said it carried out the attack because of
purported U.S. involvement in President Corazon Aquino's
counterinsurgency campaign.
   The commander of U.S. forces in the Pacific, Adm. Huntington
Hardisty, said Friday that U.S. troops will defend themselves if
attacked but will avoid taking action that will put them in direct
conflict with the rebels.
   ``Certainly, if we are under attack or if your life is
threatened, you're going to take appropriate action,'' Hardisty,
commander in chief of the U.S. Pacific Command, told reporters at a
breakfast meeting.
   ``But I will only think that would be the bottom line in any
involvement. We certainly would not put ourselves, nor our
commanders allowing our forces to be put in a situation, where
there would be confrontation with the (rebels).''
   The Philippines News Agency said the documents were seized
Thursday. It quoted police officials outside the U.S.-run Clark Air
Base, 50 miles north of Manila, as saying the attacks on Americans
are intended to ``create a propaganda impact'' for the rebels.
   Hardisty said Rowe's death and threats against Americans were
rebel attempts to grab headlines but would not deter U.S. support
for the Aquino administration.
   ``We will not be intimidated by New People's Army terror
tactics,'' he said.
   U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt meanwhile welcomed Mrs. Aquino's
announcement that the Philippines will begin discussions with U.S.
officials before yearend on whether to extend the U.S. bases' lease
here, which expires in 1991.
   The military also reported Friday that a soldier ran amok
outside of Cagayan de Oro in Misamis Oriental province in the
southern Philippines, killing six people and wounding 14 before
committing suicide.
   It said Constable 2nd Class Ramon Cabisada fired an M-16 rifle
and grenade launcher in attacks Wednesday and Thursday on Upper
Gusa and Lower Gusa villages, then went to his nearby boarding
house and shot himself to death.
   No motive was given.

<HEAD>Insurers Ready To Accept California Reforms</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Insurance company officials, freed by a
state Supreme Court ruling from the prospect of mandatory rate
rollbacks, said Friday they could adapt to the rest of an insurance
initiative passed by voters last fall.
   The court's ruling Thursday upheld most of Proposition 103, a
consumer-sponsored initiative that gives the state greater control
over insurers.
   But the court rejected parts of the initiative that called for
mandatory rollbacks and a one-year freeze of auto, property and
liability rates at 20 percent below November 1987 levels.
   ``A lot of industry fears have been relieved, because it appears
the court understands what constitutes a reasonable return'' on
investment, said Scott Carpenter, spokesman for the Western
Insurance Information Service, an industry group.
   ``We think we can live with it,'' said State Farm Insurance
spokesman Ron Arnold.
   Many of the same companies had theatened to quit the lucrative
California market after passage of Proposition 103, the
farthest-reaching of five insurance-related initiatives on last
November's ballot.
   State Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie blocked companies
from leaving in the immediate aftermath of the referendum, citing
Proposition 103's ban on arbitrarily refusing to renew auto
insurance policies and a state law requiring a withdrawing insurer
to arrange substitute coverage.
   Thursday's ruling broadens insurers' exemptions from the
proposed rate rollback and appears to allow current rate-setting
practices to continue through November, unless the insurance
commissioner intervenes.
   The conservative court ruled that the Proposition 103 was too
narrow in excusing insurers from the rollback and freeze only if
they could prove a ``substantial threat of insolvency.''
   Constitutional guarantees of property rights require a ``fair
rate of return,'' the justices said; in addition, insurers who
apply for exemptions from the rollback can continue to set their
own rates, subject to a later decision by Gillespie on whether the
amounts are more than necessary for a fair return.
   Starting in November any rate increase will need advance
approval from the insurance commissioner, who is currently
appointed by the governor but under Proposition 103 will become an
elected official after 1990.
   Although most companies have not yet indicated whether they
intend to seek such exemptions, virtually all the insurers are
expected to do so.
   ``We already justify rates in a number of states across the
country, and we can do that in California,'' said Gordon Hamilton
of Safeco Insurance Co. of America. ``It should be an easy job.''
   ``It should be the end of sky-high, take-it-or-leave-it rate
increases,'' countered Attorney General John Van de Kamp, who
opposed Proposition 103 on the ballot but defended it in court.
Consumer activists who sponsored the measure promised to monitor
Gillespie's enforcement efforts and use their new rights under the
law to gain access to insurers' financial records.
   Gillespie, an appointee of Gov. George Deukmejian, is a former
insurance executive.
   The initiative also restricts non-renewal of auto insurance
policies and the use of geography in rate-setting, and establishes
antitrust liability for collusion by insurers.

<HEAD>Military Chief Blames Nicaragua, Cuba for Rebel Strength</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nicaragua and Cuba have
provided more than two-thirds of the arms used by the country's
leftist guerrillas, who would wither as a fighting force without
such support, the military said Friday.
   Col. Rene Emilio Ponce, the head of the joint chiefs of staff,
called for linking the issues of cutting off arms to the Salvadoran
insurgents and demobilizing U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebels, known as
Contras.
   This would ``make the pacification process truly regional,'' he
said in an interview.
   A regional peace process began in August 1987, when five Central
American presidents signed a peace accord known as Esquipulas II
that called for ending civil wars in Nicaragua, El Salvador and
Guatemala.
   ``As it is now, it appears the only objective of Esquipulas II
is to dismantle the Contras and consolidate the Sandinista
government'' in Nicaragua, Ponce said.
   El Salvador's rightist president-elect, Alfredo Cristiani,
echoed Ponce's claims Friday during a news conference in Costa
Rica. He said the rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front
``recently received new arms from Cuba and Nicaragua, and I don't
think this indicates the Sandinista government wants peace,'' he
said.
   Cristiani, who takes over June 1 as head of this country's
U.S.-backed government, said Nicaragua is the main obstacle to
regional peace.
   He was in Costa Rica to discuss the next regional summit with
President Oscar Arias, who won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for his
efforts toward regional peace.
   In San Salvador, Ponce spoke in the joint chiefs briefing room
next to an array of 30 Soviet-bloc weapons _ AK-47 assault rifles,
Dragunov sniper rifles, rocket-propelled grenade launchers, and
submachine guns.
   Ponce said the weapons were among 60 East-bloc arms captured
from insurgent forces this year.
   He said 70 percent of rebel weapons come from Cuba and Nicaragua.
   Ponce said arms shipments to rebel forces increased beginning
last September. Army intelligence now figures 1,000 AKs have
entered the country in recent months.
   The rebels says they capture the vast majority of their arms and
munitions from government soldiers.
   They maintain offices in Managua but deny receiving anything but
moral and diplomatic support from Nicaragua.
   Rebel leaders interviewed in their northern strongholds say they
have bought Soviet-bloc weapons, including several hundred AK-47s,
since late last year. They say the weapons came from Contra rebel
camps in Honduras.
   ``Some Contras may have sold their weapons on the black market,
and the (Salvadoran) subversives may have obtained some of them
that way. But not 1,000,'' Ponce said.
   He said Nicaragua sends arms to Salvadoran rebels by land and
sea in shipments of about 50 rifles at a time. The land routes
include a stretch through Honduran territory along the mountainous
border with El Salvador.
   Ponce said that without outside support, the rebels would lose
their military strength and would have to resort to terrorism.
   He said small Nicaraguan vessels, ostensibly fishing craft,
deliver arms to guerrillas at several points along El Salvador's
Pacific coast.
   But he acknowledged that no vessel has been caught transporting
such weapons.
   More than 65,000 Salvadorans, mostly civilians, have been killed
in the country's eight-year civil war.

<TEXT>
   Showers and thunderstorms spread over much of the Southeast and
up the Ohio Valley to the Atlantic Coast on Friday, and
unseasonably cold air spilled into the central part of the nation
with temperatures hitting record lows.
   Severe thunderstorms which battered Texas and the lower
Mississippi Valley during the preceding day spread out Friday into
Alabama, Georgia and the Carolinas.
   During the morning, wind damage to trees, roofs and power lines
was reported across Mississippi. Thunderstorms moving through
Birmingham, Ala., also produced high wind that downed trees.
   Thunderstorms developing ahead of a cold front entering the
lower Ohio Valley spawned a tornado near Owensboro, Ky., during the
afternoon which downed power lines and large trees and flipped
several vehicles, the National Weather Service said.
   Showers and thunderstorms extended from western Kentucky across
northwestern Ohio.
   Showers prevailed across the upper Ohio Valley and along the
middle Atlantic Coast.
   Elsewhere, a few showers and thunderstorms developed along an
upper level weather disturbance crossing the lower Missouri Valley.
   Afternoon temperatures were generally only in the 30s and 40s
across the northern Plains and the upper Mississippi Valley, with
temperatures in the 20s in northern Minnesota, northwestern
Wisconsin and northwestern Upper Michigan.
   Freeze advisories were posted overnight for Iowa, central and
eastern Nebraska, northern and southwestern Missouri and
Northeastern kansas.
   Alamosa, Colo., dropped to a record low of 21 degrees and
International Falls, Minn., tied its record for the date of just 19
degrees.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 22
degrees at Ely and International Falls, Minn., to 98 at Gila Bend,
Ariz., and Twentynine Palms, Calif. Friday's low for the Lower 48
was 14 degrees at Gunnison, Colo.
   For Saturday, scattered thunderstorms were forecast over the
Southeast, with numerous showers and thunderstorms across the
middle Atlantic Coast states and showers over New England, the
Great Lakes and the Ohio Valley.
   Highs in the 40s were predicted from eastern Minnesota to Lower
Michigan and western Ohio; in the 40s and 50s across the Ohio
Valley, the Great Lakes and the middle and upper Mississippi
Valley; in the 80s from Florida and southern Georgia to southern
and central Texas, and across most of the West; and in the 90s and
above 100 in the desert Southwest.

   Prosecutors said Friday they were

   Police say Jean-Marie Tjibaou and Yeiwene Yeiwene were shot to
death Thursday on the island of Ouvea by Djubelly Wea, a separatist
opposed to Tjibaou's moderate policies. Tjibaou's bodyguards killed
Wea after the attack.
   Witnesses said other gunmen were involved.
   Premier Michel Rocard of France said he would fly to New
Caledonia for the funeral Sunday of Tjibaou, president of the Kanak
Socialist National Liberation Front, and Yeiwene, his chief aide.
   Rocard said New Caledonian elections planned for June 11 would
be postponed because they would interfere with the traditional
period of mourning. No new date was announced.
   Prosecutors identified those held as Paoula Wea, a nephew of
Djubelly Wea; Andre Tangopi, and Fessen Tuet. Tangopi was reported
wounded in the exchange of gunfire and was under police guard in
the hospital at Noumea, the provincial capital.
   The senior surviving leader of the front, Leopold Joredie, said
the group would continue participating in a ``peace process'' that
began last year and is to culminate in a 1998 referendum on
independence.
   ``The word of Jean-Marie Tjibaou will be respected, and we
pledge to make sure that the process is followed to its
conclusion,'' he said.
   Foreign Minister Gareth Evans of Australia said in Sydney: ``All
Australians will join right-minded New Caledonians in deploring
this shocking act of violence. Jean-Marie Tjibaou was an
inspiration to his people and one of the great apostles of
moderation in New Caledonia's recent troubled history.''
   In New Zealand, Foreign Minister Russell Marshall called Tjibaou
``a man of conviction and vision. All those of us who met him and
knew him were impressed by his courage and purposeful moderation.''
   Joredie, a witness to the killings, said he thought at least
five or six gunmen were involved.
   His organization canceled ceremonies on the first anniversary of
an assault by French military police May 5, 1988, on a cave where
separatists were holding more than 20 other officers hostage.
Nineteen hostage-takers and two policemen were killed.
   Tjibaou, Yeiwene and Joredie were in Ouvea for the ceremonies
when the shooting occurred.
   Native Melanesians known as Kanaks make up 43 percent of the
people in New Caledonia, a group of islands 1,000 miles east of
Australia, and most favor independence. Nearly all European
settlers and descendants of settlers, 37 percent of the population,
want the islands to remain part of France.
   The rest of New Caledonia's residents, Polynesians and Asians,
also generally favor staying with France. The Melanesian population
is growing much faster than the others and is expected to regain
the majority early in the next century.

<TEXT>
   More than 20,000 copper workers from the
official trade union alliance and from Solidarity have gone on
strike at four mines in southwestern Poland to demand higher pay,
an activist said Friday.
   Jan Sugalski, a local Solidarity activist, said the miners were
demanding a 50 percent increase in pay. He said miners earn between
$118 and $176 a month.
   Sugalski said the miners had formed a strike committee composed
of representatives of the official OPZZ trade union alliance and
Solidarity, the independent trade union. He said they remained on
the surface of the pits and were carrying out maintenance
underground.
   The strikers handed over a list of demands, all of which
concerned pay, and they were rejected by management, Sugalski said.
   Solidarity was legalized April 17 after a seven-year ban as a
result of agreements reached between the opposition and communist
authorities at round-table talks. The talks were proposed by the
government during a serious wave of strikes last August.
   Workers were striking at the Lubin, Polkowice, Rudna and
Sieroszowice mines near the city of Lubin, 203 miles southwest of
Warsaw, Sugalski and the state-run news agency PAP reported.
   PAP said the miners went on strike on the morning shift and were
joined by workers on the afternoon shift. The agency gave no
figures on the number of strikers.
   Talks between management and representatives had brought no
results by evening, PAP reported.

   A Conservative lawmaker, acknowledging a lack of
support from his own party, withdrew a bill Friday to curb media
intrusion into people's private lives.
   It was the second time in recent weeks that proposals to control
news organizations have foundered.
   Parliament member John Browne said he withdrew his privacy bill
because he believed it would be defeated. It was opposed by the
Conservative government, which holds a large majority in Parliament.
   The bill was to be debated Friday in the House of Commons. It
would have given people the right to sue when certain information
was published without their consent.
   An opposition Labor lawmaker last month gave up a bill to force
newspapers to publish corrections. The governing party also opposed
that measure.

   The robot Magellan probe streaked on
a near-perfect path toward Venus on Friday while Atlantis'
astronauts melted metal and did other routine tests in orbit.
   The astronauts' work load was light because the heavy weight of
Magellan and its rocket booster, totaling 45,000 pounds, had
restricted the amount of experiments they could carry for the
four-day mission.
   Conversation from the astronauts also was light as they
methodically went about their work, talking only sparingly with
controllers on the ground.
   The 7,600-pound Magellan, launched late Thursday, was more than
175,000 miles from the shuttle by late Friday afternoon and zipping
deeper into space, its systems operating perfectly, officials said.
It still had about 158 million miles to go.
   Barreling along initially at 25,000 mph, the craft slowed
gradually to a cruising speed of about 7,000 mph. When it reaches
its target in August 1990, the tug of Venusian gravity will have
increased the speed again to about 25,000 mph.
   The spacecraft was in excellent condition and on a course that
was only .5 of a degree off normal, Magellan officials said. Such a
deviation was expected, they said, and on May 21, a ground station
will send a signal to trigger a small motor firing to adjust the
path.
   ``The spacecraft is performing just beautifully. All systems are
operational and nominal. It couldn't be better,'' John Gerpheide,
Magellan project manager, said a few hours after the probe was
launched. ``It was really a wonderful day for us, the beginning of
the rebirth of the planetary program.''
   Magellan is the first U.S. planetary mission in 11 years and the
first ever launched from a space shuttle.
   Mission Control in Houston awakened the astronauts Friday for
their first full day in space with the theme music from the movie
``Superman.''
   ``Good morning and congratulations on a super day yesterday,''
said Mission Control communicator Ken Cameron.
   ``Good morning, Houston,'' commander David Walker replied.
``We're up and around. Everybody's feeling good, trying to find our
toothbrushes.''
   Afterward, the astronauts worked with a 128-pound
metals-processing furnace the size of a small microwave oven. They
also brought along medical experiments and several cameras for
photographing the Earth and night lightning strikes in the clouds
below.
   The crew was melting and resolidifying small samples of indium
and selenium in the furnace to see how they react in
weightlessness. Potential applications for such space-made
materials include advanced electronic and optical devices.
   The astronauts reported one melting indium sample may have been
affected by vibrations when Walker briefly fired the shuttle's
steering thrusters in a test for the Strategic Defensive
Initiative, the so-called Star Wars plan to build a missile defense
system. Tracking devices in Hawaii recorded the firings to help SDI
engineers better understand the characteristics of ignitions in
space.
   Flight director Ron Dittemore said in Houston it was not certain
the sample was bothered by the vibrations.
   He reported Atlantis' systems were in excellent condition and
the only problems were ``just annoyances.'' He said a facsimile
machine being tested for sending documents to the shuttle was shut
down when its paper jammed and that a machine for measuring blood
pressure in the jugular system failed.
   Mission specialists Mary Cleave and Mark Lee released Magellan
from the cargo bay by remote control late Thursday, slightly more
than six hours after Atlantis blasted into orbit from Kennedy Space
Center.
   An hour later, two bursts from an on-board rocket propelled the
robot on the start of the $550 million mission to map the surface
of cloud-shrouded Venus with a high resolution radar system.
   Venus is 158 million miles from Earth. But Magellan, looping 1{
times around the sun, will travel 806 million miles to reach its
destination.
   The probe's radar is to map up to 90 percent of the Venusian
surface during a 243-day orbital period. The images, enhanced by
computers, are expected to show features as small as a football
field; that would be 10 times clearer than pictures obtained by
earlier spacecraft.
   The pictures could tell scientists much about the history of
Venus and how it evolved so differently from Earth, although both
were believed to be nearly identical at the beginning of the solar
system, 4.6 billion years ago.
   Atlantis is to return to Earth on Monday, landing at Edwards Air
Force Base, Calif., at 12:43 p.m. PDT. The other crew members are
pilot Ron Grabe and mission specialist Norman Thagard.

   President Bush took note of the Mexican
independence holiday Friday with a celebration in the White House
attended by Mexican-American leaders from around the country.
   In the East room ceremony, Bush watched a group of children from
Toledo, dressed in traditional Spanish colonial garb, dance to
mariachi music.
   He told the gathering that Americans identify with the Mexican
independence struggle commemorated on this day.
   In a message honoring the day, he said, ``Our country is proud
of the long-standing friendship that has existed between the Untied
States and Mexico and prouder still of the wonderful contributions
Mexican Americans have made to our nation.''
   The president told the White House gathering that Americans
share the ideals of the Mexican people, ``ideals that know no
boundary,''
   And he said, ``We deeply respect your commitment to family,
honor and tradition.''
   Bush was joined at the ceremony by Education Secretary Lauro
Cavazos and John Negroponte, his nominee for ambassador to Mexico.

   Communist Party leaders announced Friday
that private farming will be expanded and land will be leased to
farmers for up to 50 years, the official news agency BTA reported.
   It said the measures were in a Politburo report presented by
party chief Todor Zhivkov at a two-day Central Committee on
agricultural policy that ended Friday.
   The agency also indicated there was disagreement over policy on
food prices. BTA quoted Stoyan Ovcharov, the economics and planning
minister, as telling the committee a new pricing system is needed
to stimulate production, but said nothing of agreement on such a
policy.
   As in the Soviet Union, which recently adopted similar farming
reforms, orthodox Communists worry that food prices might climb
rapidly if government purchase prices are raised and private
farmers produce more food.
   Privately cultivated plots account for only 13 percent of the
land farmed in Bulgaria, but yields almost one-third of total milk
production, about 40 percent of meat and 50 percent of the eggs
produced.
   Economic reformers argue that agriculture should be allowed
freer rein to develop.

   The new incarnation of ``the loneliest
repairman in town'' introduced himself to Maytag Co. workers
Friday, when officials marked 40 years of making washing machines
and other appliances at their plant here.
   Gordon Jump, an actor best known for his portrayal of the
bumbling station manager Arthur Carlson in the defunct television
series ``WKRP in Cincinnati,'' is the new ``Ol' Lonely'' repairman
in Maytag commercials.
   ``I have a Maytag washer and dryer in our home. I could not be
more proud to represent any product or group of people,'' Jump told
workers at Maytag's Plant No. 2.
   Jump, 56, succeeded actor Jess White in March as the Lonely
Repairman in March. White spent 21 years as the character devised
to promote a product the company said was so dependable the service
department rarely was called. He is now a Maytag consultant.
   Plant No. 2 started production on April 4, 1949. Since then, its
workforce has grown from about 450 employees to about 2,500, and it
has produced about 42 million automatic washing machines and other
appliances, said Ron Krajnovich, Maytag Co.'s public relations
director.
   Maytag, one of the units of the more than $3 billion Maytag
Corp., also employs an additional 1,000 people in another Newton
location.
   Before Plant No. 2 and its automatic products, Maytag had been
making wringer washing machines and other appliances for about 40
years.
   ``I remember when most of the plant was just dirt floor. The
construction people actually outnumbered the Maytag employees,''
said Bob Lister, who joined the company in March 1949.
   ``We had hopes it would continue to expand, but none of us could
foresee this kind of growth,'' said Paul Provin, an engineer who
joined Maytag in January 1942 and will retire in December. ``It's
been a super good place to work.''

<TEXT>
   Warsaw Pact nations opened negotiations
on conventional weapons Friday by pressing for superpower talks on
nuclear arms, jumping into a dispute that has split the NATO
alliance.
   East German Ambassador Klaus-Dietrich Ernst warned that failure
to hold talks on short-range nuclear weapons could ``have negative
effects'' on the Vienna negotiations.
   He said negotiations on tactical nuclear rockets are vital for
East and West Germans.
   ``The way these weapons are stationed today, it would be above
all the citizens of both German states who would be the victim of
their use,'' he said.
   U.S. Ambassador Steven J. Ledogar said all the East bloc
diplomats who addressed Friday's meeting insisted that a set of
``parallel negotiations'' be held on reducing short-range nuclear
weapons.
   Ledogar suggested the Soviet-led alliance was using the Vienna
talks, which are to focus strictly on non-nuclear weapons, to play
upon NATO's internal bickering over the nuclear issue.
   ``I suspect that they know that there's a certain amount of
discussion in the NATO camp,'' he said.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, whose popularity is
crumbling at home, has insisted that superpower talks begin soon on
short-range nuclear weapons. He also has asked NATO to delay a
decision on whether to modernize the missiles until after elections
are held next year.
   The United States and Britain want the weapons upgraded quickly
and reject talks with the Soviets on reducing short-range missiles.
They argue that the missiles are necessary because of Soviet
superiority in conventional forces.
   In Washington, President Bush's spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
that work on conventional force reductions is complex, but ``the
United States and its allies are, however, encouraged by the
seriousness with which the Soviet Union and its allies have entered
into this negotiation.
   ``What is needed now is for them to join NATO in exchanges that
are frank and constructive and enhance the chances for success,''
Fitzwater said in a statement.
   Ernst and Soviet Ambassador Oleg A. Grinevsky said that the
seven Warsaw Pact nations see talks on short-range nuclear weapons
and naval forces as part of overall efforts to reduce arms and
increase security in Europe.
   The issue is sensitive in Western Europe, where many are
attracted to Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's conciliatory
gestures to the West, but especially so in West Germany, where most
of the missiles are based.
   But Ledogar said all parties agreed that the current round of
Vienna talks, a resumption of negotiations that began March 9, are
to focus solely on conventional weapons.
   NATO estimates the Warsaw Pact has more than a 2-1 advantage in
artillery and tanks in Europe, and far more troops than the West.
   Washington argues that even unilateral cuts announced by
Gorbachev last year will not alter the balance significantly.
Gorbachev announced in December that 50,000 Soviet troops and 5,000
tanks would pull out of East Germany, Hungary and Czechoslovakia by
1991. The withdrawals began last week in Hungary with the departure
of 31 T-64 tanks.
   Ernst said that further unilateral cuts by the various Warsaw
Pact allies mean that, by 1991, the Soviet bloc will cut its troops
by 581,300 men, 12,751 tanks, 10,030 artillery systems, 1,010
combat aircraft, 895 armored vehicles and 30 ``nuclear systems.''
   Grinevsky used Friday's session to outline a plan dividing the
zone covered by the talks _ from the Atlantic to the Ural mountains
deep inside the Soviet Union _ into smaller regions.
   He said the sides should work to agree on overall totals for the
number of men and weapons each military bloc can possess, but also
agree on totals for each region.
   But Grinevsky failed to provide any weapons ceilings. Ledogar
said such totals were vital for progress at the talks.
   At the previous round of talks that ended March 22, the Warsaw
Pact outlined plans for reducing troops and weapons 10 percent to
15 percent below present levels by 1994, a further 25 percent by
1997 and moving to completely defensive forces by the year 2000.
   NATO presented a more specific proposal for ceilings on tanks,
artillery and armored personnel carriers.

<HEAD>Judge Strikes Down New Abortion Law For Single Girls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAVARES, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Florida's new abortion consent law for
single girls under 18 has been declared unconstitutional by a judge
who asked a higher court to clarify the statute.
   Judge Jerry Lockett said the law was so vague he was unable to
hold a proper hearing on a petition by a 15-year-old girl who is 11
weeks pregnant and wants an abortion without her parents' consent.
   Before the new law was passed last year, unmarried girls under
18 could obtain abortions without consent from parents or the
courts. The new law requires them to obtain permission from a
parent or guardian; if they are unwilling to approach them, they
may file a petition in circuit court.
   But the new law and rules of procedure adopted early this year
force judges to ``rubber stamp'' teen-agers' claims, Lockett said
Thursday.
   The law requires judges to rule within 48 hours after a girl
files a petition. If a judge does not rule by then, the girl is
free to proceed with the abortion. The matter has to be secret, and
neither the judge nor the state is allowed to call in testimony
from anyone other than the girl.
   A judge must grant the request if any one of these conditions
are met:
   _The girl is sufficiently mature to make the decision.
   _Consent for the abortion is being ``unreasonably withheld'' by
the parents or guardian.
   _The girl has presented ``facts that justify the fear of
physical or emotional abuse'' if she requests help from her parents
or guardians.
   _``Any other good cause'' is presented.
   ``The law is too vague,'' the judge said. ``I want the court to
tell me how to determine if a girl is mature enough to make this
decision.''
   The case was sent to the 5th District Court of Appeal in Daytona
Beach. If that court does not act in 10 days, the girl can proceed
with an abortion.
   Lockett said the law and the rules do not give the court, or
anyone who wants to intervene, the right or the time to hold a
proper hearing on the claims in the petition.
   In this case, the judge appointed attorney Red Boylston as a
one-time guardian for the fetus and allowed him to argue the
constitutionality of the statute and the rules. Boylston refused to
comment except to say he agrees that the law needs to be more
detailed.
   The girl was represented by Jerry Blair, who said she would
prefer to have more specific rules she could use in petition
hearings.
   The judge said the higher court or the Legislature should revise
the law to assist judges.
   ``Even if it was some sort of a checklist _ something that says
you have to find this and this and this _ that would be better than
what we have,'' Lockett said.

<HEAD>Teacher Files Charges Against Student `Terrorists' Who Disrupted

<TEXT>
   A University of Rhode Island professor
filed criminal charges against four fraternity students who dressed
as terrorists and staged a mock kidnapping in her classroom.
   Margaret Haggerty said Friday she brought the felony charges
because she felt the university's decision to put the Lambda Chi
Alpha fraternity on probation for at least one year was too light.
   ``My goal wasn't to put these kids in prison,'' Haggerty said in
a telephone interview. ``My goal is to give them a sense of
accountability and acceptable behavior and hope it would never,
ever happen again in a classroom.''
   Haggerty was teaching a nursing class on death and dying Dec. 7
when four men dressed as terrorists and carrying toy assault
weapons and a toy handgun allegedly burst into the room and
kidnapped a sorority president.
   The young woman willingly went with them after the fraternity
members spoke to her in Greek, said Lt. James McDonald of the
campus police.
   ``As they were leaving, the man with the handgun turned around,
about 10 feet from the instructor, and pulled the trigger,'' he
said. ``It made a popping sound.''
   For at least a decade, sorority presidents have been kidnapped
and ransomed for food, which is donated to a local charity, said
Thomas Dougan, assistant vice president for campus life.
   ``It was a philanthropic event, and this is a miscarriage of
justice,'' said one of the students arrested, James E. Pennoyer
III, who is the current fraternity president. ``We didn't do a
thing to her (Haggerty). We came in and took a student who knew we
were coming. It's totally ridiculous.''
   The teacher filed a complaint with campus police March 2 after
the university reported its disciplinary decision. The four
students, Pennoyer, 21, and David M. Jones, 20, both of East
Providence; Antonio DaSilva, 23, Pawtucket; and Michael I. Miga,
19, Warwick, were arrested and arraigned Thursday on charges of
felony assault by use of devices similar in appearance to a firearm.
   The charge carries a maximum penalty of three years in prison in
this case, since no serious injury occurred.
   The students were released on personal recognizance. A felony
screening date of June 7 was set, at which time the campus police
will turn the matter over to the attorney general's office. The
state office has not decided whether to pursue the charges, said
spokesman Tom Connell.
   Haggerty, an associate professor of nursing, said the four were
``dressed like terrorists,'' and she had no idea the incident was
part of a fund-raiser.
   ``I said, `Get out of this room. Get out of this classroom,' ''
Haggerty said. ``I was more or less in shock.
   ``It's not an acceptable way to raise money for the poor. Using
violence and terrorism to achieve a good just isn't appropriate,''
said Haggerty, who maintains she did not know the weapons were fake.
   Dougan said he felt the university's probation of the fraternity
was sufficient. The fraternity ``was extremely cooperative, they
apologized, they were extremely embarrassed. Certainly their
intention was not to disrupt or upset individuals in the classroom.
It's the strongest punishment I can give a fraternity short of
closing the chapter.''

   Kidnappers freed two West Germans on
Friday after holding them overnight but were holding a third
hostage in connection with the trial of a Lebanese hijacker in
Frankfurt, Palestinian guerrillas said.
   There was no independent confirmation of the reported
abductions, and the guerrillas did not identify the alleged
kidnappers.
   In Bonn, West German Foreign Ministry spokesman Hans Schumacher
noted that two of the alleged victims also disappeared briefly in
Lebanon a year ago. He said he found their latest 10-hour
disappearance ``a bit strange.''
   Lt. Col. Wajih Abu Ali, the commander of the PLO's military
police in Sidon, said Heinrich Struebig, 48, Petra Schnitzler, 26,
and Markus Michael, 25, were abducted Thursday evening by five
gunmen outside Sidon.
   All three work for the ASME-Humanitas relief agency from an
office near the southern port city.
   The Sunni Moslem Nasserite militia, which controls the area
around Sidon, said Struebig, an administrator at ASME-Humanitas,
and Ms. Schnitzler, a nurse, were freed at 5 a.m.
   The two met briefly with the militia's leader, Mustafa Saad, at
his office in Sidon. Reporters were kept out of the meeting and
were not allowed to speak to either of the West Germans. They hid
their faces from photographers.
   Later, Struebig and Ms. Schnitzler were driven to an
ASME-Humanitas base. It was closed to reporters.
   ``The released two told me they are scared because the
kidnappers have threatened to kill their colleague if they revealed
any information about their abduction,'' Abu Ali told reporters.
   In West Germany, ASME-Humanitas spokeswoman Dagmar Nackunstz
said the group could not confirm the abductions had taken place.
She confirmed Struegib and Ms. Schnitzler work for the organization
and said the group has a worker with the first name of Markus in
Lebanon, but she refused to give any other details.
   A Palestinian officer in charge of security at the office where
they work quoted Struebig and Schnitzler as saying Michael was
being held in connection with the case of Mohammed Ali Hamadi, a
Shiite Moslem on trial for murder and air piracy in Frankfurt.
   The officer, Lt. Maarouf, who uses just one name, did not say if
any demands had been made.
   ZDF, a West German television network, said the kidnappers
``apparently'' gave the freed histages ``a statement with their
demands,'' which included a light sentence for Hamadi. It
identified the man still held as Markus Quint, 24, who joined the
relief team in south Lebanon only 10 days ago.
   Hamadi faces life in prison if convicted in the June 1985
hijacking of a TWA jetliner and the murder of U.S. Navy diver
Robert Stethem, a passenger. He admitted taking part in the
hijacking but denies killing Stethem.
   In January 1987, shortly after Hamadi's arrest in Frankfurt,
West Germans Rudolf Cordes and Alfred Schmidt were kidnapped in
Lebanon. They were eventually freed, and a group that claimed
responsibility for the abductions said the releases were a gesture
aimed at winning a lenient sentence for Hamadi.
   The chief judge in Hamadi's trial, Heiner Mueckenberger, said
the proceedings would not be influenced by any kidnapping.
   Abu Ali told reporters five gunmen in a BMW stopped the
humanitarian workers' van and ``pointed automatic rifles at them
and ordered the three to come out of the van quickly, and lie down
spread-eagled.''
   ``The gunmen bundled Struebig in the trunk and forced the others
to sit on their laps on the back seat of the BMW and sped away
toward the south,'' he added.
   Abu Ali said Nasserite militiamen manning a checkpoint on
Sidon's southern edge fired at the car ``because the driver did not
stop... The vehicle's left-side mirror was hit, but the driver
continued.''
   He said Struebig and Schnitzler were released outside Sidon and
took a cab to their base.
   Abu Ali said PLO chief Yasser Arafat was in ``constant contact
with us by telephone to inquire about efforts to resolve the
kidnapping issue.'' He did not elaborate.
   Fifteen foreigners are held hostage in Lebanon, including nine
Americans. The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle
East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March
16, 1985.
   Hamadi's elder brother, Abdul-Hadi, heads the security apparatus
for the Iranian-backed extremist group Hezbollah, the umbrella for
underground pro-Iranian factions holding most of the captives.
   Another Hamadi brother, Abbas, was convicted in West Germany in
the kidnappings of Cordes and Schmidt.
   In April 1988, Steubig and Ms. Schnitzler were thought to have
been kidnapped after they disappeared in Lebanon for two days.
   ASMA-Humanitas later said they had not been taken hostage. It
said a pro-Iranian Shiite group involved with their disappearance
apologized to the two after discovering their identities and
sheltered them to protect them from fighting in the area.

   Jimmy Carter joined fellow former
President Gerald Ford on Friday to help monitor the presidential
election, which the opposition is proclaiming will be a fraud.
   The opposition also complained that the government controlled by
Gen. Antonio Manuel Noriega closed an opposition-owned radio
station Friday.
   Ricardo Arias Calderon, nominee for first vice president for the
three-party opposition coalition, said proofs of government intent
to steal Sunday's election are mounting daily.
   ``It is our duty as Panamanians to publicly denounce this to the
world and especially to nations where there is true justice,
liberty and democracy, that the dictatorial regime has been
systematically excercising the biggest and most bald-faced fraud in
our history,'' Arias Calderon told a news conference.
   Polls give the opposition ticket headed by Guillermo Endara a
big edge. The opposition has hinted it may call supporters into the
streets or call a general strike if evidence of fraud surfaces
after the elections.
   ``We haven't the slightest faith in the Electoral Tribunal,''
Endara said.
   Carter said at a news conference Friday, ``The process of
democratization of Panama has been very slow, and that is one of
the reasons we decided to come here to monitor the elections.''
   Carter and former Panamanian strongman Gen. Omar Torrijos in
1977 signed the Panama Canal treaties, which give full control of
the canal to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999.
   Ford arrived Thursday night as part of an invited delegation
headed by Carter under the auspices of the Council of Freely
Elected Heads of Government. Carter is chairman of the private
council.
   No immediate government reaction came to Friday's announcement
in Washington that President Bush was sending an official
delegation of 14 U.S. observers headed by Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa.,
to monitor the elections.
   Panama invited delegations from the European Parliament and a
number of Latin and Caribbean countries, and said other delegations
would not be welcome.
   The official U.S. delegation is to arrive Saturday at U.S.
Howard Air Force Base, thereby avoiding Panama's requirement for
entrance visas.
   At another news conference, government candidate Carlos Duque
denied that fraud was planned.
   ``The United States should say how this fraud will take place
before the eyes of the world. The observers will recognize our
triumph,'' Duque said.
   ``We do not seek a confrontation with the United States. We
think the U.S. government has fallen for disinformation,
disinformation lead by the U.S. embassy which has played an
unfortunate role.''
   Duque said Noriega should continue in command of the Defense
Forces, but that this was up to the institution of the Defense
Forces itself.
   ``Gen. Noriega has never violated the law and has always acted
within the institutional framework of his command,'' said Duque.
   As armed forces chief, Noriega is the de facto leader of Panama.
   The Bush administration has predicted the elections will be
blatantly fraudulent and accused Noriega of rigging the balloting
for Duque.
   Arias Calderon said the voting process is riddled with
irregularities.
   The opposition says an abnormal increase in the number of
registered voters indicates double registration and shows that
bogus voting cards are being distributed to pro-government voters.
   A spokesman for Endara, Luis Martinz, said Radio Suave, owned by
opposition legislative candidate Carlos Fabrega was closed Friday,
but said he did not know why.
   ``These days we don't ask those things here,'' he told The
Associated Press.
   The opposition press has been closed in Panama for 15 months,
but the opposition has had access to some radio stations.
   Duque, hand-picked by Noriega, has contended that the opposition
is in league with the United States to cancel or delay the delivery
of the Panama Canal to Panama at the end of the century.
   The Duque campaign has made heavy use of news reports that the
U.S. government authorized $10 million for the opposition campaign
to bolster its claim that the United States wants to manage
Panama's internal affairs. Opposition leaders deny seeking or
accepting any foreign contributions.
   The United States has sought Noriega's departure since two
federal grand juries in Florida indicted him on drug trafficking
charges in February 1988.
   Noriega denies the charges, calling them a ploy to get rid of
him in favor of someone more willing to follow Washington's wishes.
   While Noriega is not a candidate, his rule is considered very
much an issue in the campaign.
   In February 1988, President Eric Delvalle tried to fire Noriega
following the drug indictments. Noriega, who has held de facto
power since he became Defense Forces chief in 1983, orchestrated
Delvalle's removal.
   Delvalle was replaced by Education Minister Manuel Solis Palma,
whom the United States does not recognize, as acting president.

   President Bush on Friday met with Nicaraguan
newspaper publisher Violeta Chamorro and criticized the leftist
Sandinista government for restricting that country's press, the
White House said.
   Mrs. Chamorro is the widow of the publisher of the widely read
newspaper, La Prensa, who was gunned down in the streets of Managua
at a time when his newspaper was harshly critical of the dictator
Anastasio Somoza.
   Mrs. Chamorro continues to publish the newspaper which has now
staked out an opposition stance to the Sandinistas who deposed
Somoza.
   She was in Washington at the invitation of the National
Endowment for Democracy, a non-profit foundation. She also met with
Rep. Frank Guarini, D-N.J., and other members of Congress to
discuss the ongoing peace process regarding the Contra rebels.
   A White House statement called Mrs. Chamorro and La Prensa
``symbols of freedom of expression and the struggle against tyranny
and dictatorship throughout Latin America, beginning with the
struggle against the Somoza government.
   Bush told Mrs. Chamorro that Nicaragua's new media law, passed
in anticipation of next year's elections, ``does not guarantee the
free-functioning of the media and unrestricted political
expression,'' and gives the Interior Ministry excessive latitude to
prosecute the media, White House statement said.

<HEAD>ABA Can't Consider Ideology in Judges</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout to include comments from ABA, Thornburgh</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Bar Association won't be allowed
to screen federal judicial nominees unless it stops considering a
candidate's political and ideological beliefs, the Justice
Department said Friday.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said he intended to hold the
ABA to an agreement he says it made to revert to old language in
its guidelines that doesn't specifically provide for any
consideration of such views.
   One of Thornburgh's top aides, David Runkel, said that unless
the ABA accepts the agreement, ``I don't think they will be
involved'' in screening judicial candidates.
   The ABA's Standing Committee on Federal Judiciary will be able
to resume its participation in screening professional
qualifications of prospective nominees as soon as it accepts the
agreement as described by the attorney general, Runkel said.
   The dispute broke out Tuesday when ABA leaders disavowed a
statement Thornburgh made to the House Judiciary Committee that
they had agreed to stop considering political and ideological
philosophy.
   And that position was reiterated Friday night by ABA President
Robert Raven, who said in a statement the bar group ``does not
examine and make value judgments about candidates' political or
ideological views.''
   ``Problems of wording and problems of perception are curable,''
Raven said. ``We look forward to working out mutually acceptable
language with the attorney general.''
   ``They got our language, go back to what it was in 1979,''
Thornburgh said in reply. ``That's what they agreed to and we
expect them to honor it.''
   Concern among conservatives over the ABA guideline surfaced
after the Senate's 1987 vote against confirming Robert Bork to the
Supreme Court. Thornburgh told the House Judiciary Committee on
Tuesday he shared the concern.
   The Bush administration is preparing to fill some 50 vacancies
on federal district and appellate courts. Traditionally, the ABA
has confidentially canvassed a candidates' peers to assess
professional abilities at the request of the administration.
   It advises the president of its findings and delivers a rating
to the Senate Judiciary Committee during the confirmation process.
   The issue is particularly sensitive because Robert B. Fiske Jr.,
Thornburgh's choice to be his deputy attorney general, has been
criticized by conservatives for the way he conducted the screening
process when he chaired the ABA panel in the early 1980s.
   Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., has charged that Fiske improperly
told a liberal activist group the names of judicial nominees under
review.
   Humphrey said Fiske was guilty of ``leaking information which
was provided to the ABA in confidence to groups that use that
information to mount campaigns against persons who are not yet
nominated.''
   At Tuesday's hearing, Thornburgh credited Fiske with obtaining
the agreement from the ABA.
   Runkel said the attorney general ``stated what he believed was
an agreement and prior to that and subsequent to that, that's our
understanding.''
   During his congressional testimony, Thornburgh said ``we are
pleased that the American Bar Association standing committee has
seen fit to withdraw from an area not only contentious but in my
view improper for their consideration _ that is to say the
political and ideological views of the prospective nominees.''
   But Raven and Harold R. Tyler Jr., chairman of the standing
committee, denied that the ABA had ever considered political views
except to assess whether they affected a person's professional
qualifications.
   In his statement Friday night, Raven said ``If a candidate's
personal philosophy, however, incorporates racially prejudiced
views, for example, we woud not agree that the candidate has the
open-mindedness and freedom from bias requisite for a position on
the bench.''
   ``Our practice in this regard has remained unchanged,'' he said.
   Tyler acknowledged only that the ABA had ``expressed a
willingness'' to delete a sentence from the latest version of the
``backgrounder'' it publishes to describe the screening process.
   The sentence that has raised the ire of conservatives reads:
``Political or ideological philosophy are not considered, except to
the extent they may bear upon the other factors.''
   Runkel released copies of letters exchanged between Tyler and
Thornburgh last month that he said had formed the basis of the
agreement. The agreement was sealed in a telephone call from Tyler
to the attorney general's executive assistant, Robert Ross, Runkel
said.
   In an April 21 letter to the attorney general, Tyler wrote that
the sentence ``has generated confusion'' and charges that the panel
considers political or ideological beliefs.
   ``This committee does not believe that that is the case,'' Tyler
added. ``Nevertheless, to make that as clear as possible, we
certainly are prepared to accept your suggestion of abandoning the
language.''
   ``In sum,'' Tyler concluded, ``be assured that, to track the
earlier language, this committee does not investigate a prospective
nominee's political or ideological philosophy, except to the extent
that extreme views on such matters might bear upon judicial
temperament or integrity.''
   In an April 27 reply, Thornburgh said ``I am concerned about the
final sentence of your letter.''
   The attorney general wrote that in his meetings with Raven and
Tyler, ``I thought I had expressed clearly my view that the
Standing Committee should in fact revert to its policy statement in
effect prior to 1980, which excluded any consideration of a
prospective nominee's political or ideological philosophy.''
   ``I would hope we are in agreement on this point,'' Thornburgh
said.

<HEAD>Death Penalty Foes Discuss How to Turn Tide</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   With about 2,200 people on death row and
polls showing support for the death penalty at an all-time high,
several hundred opponents are meeting here this weekend to try to
turn the political tide.
   ``One reason for the change in public attitudes is irresponsible
leadership by our politicians,'' said Max Stern, a leading Boston
defense attorney and organizer of the meeting of the National
Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty.
   The regional conference begins Friday night at Harvard Law
School.
   On Saturday, the coalition plans to honor Gov. Michael Dukakis
for his refusal to abandon his longtime opposition to the death
penalty for political gain, Stern said.
   Dukakis' presidential campaign last year was deeply wounded by
charges that he was soft on crime.
   A Gallup poll in December, one month after the election, found
that 79 percent of the American public favored the death penalty
for murderers. That was 9 percent more than in 1986 and the highest
percentage since pollsters began asking the question in 1936, a
Gallup spokeswoman said.
   The poll also showed a dramatic shift since 1966, when 47
percent of those polled by Gallup opposed the death penalty and
only 42 percent supported it.
   Stern and other abolitionists said the 1988 presidential
campaign, which made murderer Willie Horton a household name, has
left politicians across America afraid to buck public opinion.
   ``It's an expedient political tactic to take a very repressive
view on the death penalty, and then attack one's opponent by
associating him with heinous criminals,'' Stern said. ``That's the
Willie Horton tactic.''
   Although the tactic was used very effectively by President
Bush's campaign against Dukakis, Stern predicted it will soon lose
its potency.
   Horton fled from Massachusetts during a prison furlough in 1987
and later brutally attacked a couple in Maryland, where he is now
serving a lengthy prison sentence. The case was the subject of Bush
campaign ads attacking Dukakis and supporting the death penalty.
   The governor will receive the Herbert and Sara Ehrmann Award,
named after one of the lawyers who defended Sacco and Vanzetti and
his wife, who fought against their execution.
   Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, both anarchists, were put
to death in Massachusetts in 1927 for the murder of a paymaster and
his guard during a robbery.
   Four people have been executed in America so far this year,
including serial killer Ted Bundy, said Karima Wicks, research
director with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund in New York.
   She said abolitionists plan to stress the racist nature of the
death penalty, which studies have shown is disproportionately
applied to blacks, Hispanics, the poor and the indigent.
   The Supreme Court has rejected a bid to overturn the death
penalty on those grounds.

<TEXT>
   CIUDAD NUESTRA SENORA LA REINA DE LOS ANGELES DE PORCIUNCULA
(AP) _ Americans wrapped themselves in the red, white and green
Friday as they embraced the Mexican holiday of Cinco de Mayo at
fiestas and toasted a 127-year-old victory over colonialism with
cervezas and margaritas.
   Schoolchildren celebrated in the plaza at El Pueblo de Los
Angeles, where a fiesta will bring at least 25,000 people a day
through the weekend.
   ``There's lots of margaritas to be had,'' said bartender Tom
Madruga, mixing the icy tequila concoctions at the Mexican Cafe in
San Diego's Old Town, where the Battle of Puebla will be re-enacted
over the weekend.
   Similar festivities got under way elsewhere in Southern
California and across the Southwest, even on the East Coast.
   ``People are getting used to the idea. We run some flyers so
that everybody remembers May 5th,'' said banquet manager Rosalinda
Arrieta at an El Torito restaurant in Secaucus, N.J., that planned
``pinata madness.''
   Ms. Arrieta, judge of a contest to see how many fiery jalapeno
peppers customers could consume, said guessing how many margaritas
would be served during Cinco de Mayo ``would be very hard.''
   Cinco de Mayo marks the stand of an outnumbered Mexican force
against a superior French army at Puebla in 1862. Although the
French emperor Napoleon III eventually withdrew his invading army
from Mexico for reasons other than the Puebla setback, it is a
proud date in Mexican history.
   ``It's a celebration of the underdog,'' said actress Carmen
Zapata, who believes that non-Mexican Americans have adopted Cinco
de Mayo because they can identify with that spirit through American
history.
   Miss Zapata is a founder of the Bilingual Foundation of the
Arts, which named actors Edward James Olmos and Jorge Rivero to
receive its ``El Angel'' awards for contributions to Hispanic arts
at a dinner Friday night.
   ``I think that we are beginning to take our place in society
here,'' said Miss Zapata before the annual banquet, ``Ole Salsa,''
at the Biltmore Hotel.
   ``I feel that we have and will have a tremendous impact on the
American culture in the years to come.''
   But Cinco de Mayo wasn't just fun and food. The nation also
sought to deal with obligations to the burgeoning Hispanic
population.
   In Los Angeles _ a considerably shortened version of the name
originally bestowed in 1769 _ county Supervisor Kenneth Hahn
repeated his call for adding two seats to the Board of Supervisors
to boost ethnic representation. All five seats are now held by
Anglos.
   ``Hispanics comprise approximately 35 percent of the population
in Los Angeles County, but there is only a handful of Hispanic
elected officials to represent their interests. This is unfair and
unjust, and the situation must change,'' Hahn said.
   Immigration and Naturalization Service officials observed Cinco
de Mayo with festivities at a Hollywood legalization office to urge
temporary residents to file immediately for permanent status under
the amnesty law enacted two years ago.
   About 250,000 temporary residents have signed up for permanent
residency in the Western Region _ consisting of California,
Arizona, Nevada, Hawaii and Guam _ out of 1.8 million eligible
applicants, he said.

   A high school student and his married
date have been getting invitations to dance at proms across the
country since they were denied permission to attend his hometown
prom.
   Jayme Wessels, 17, wanted to take Delores Washburn, 35, to the
Alburnett High School prom last Saturday but the school board
denied permission, saying it was inappropriate for a student to
bring a married date to a school event.
   A judge upheld the school, saying the school board's decision
wasn't out of bounds, and the couple stayed home. But word of their
case spread around the country and invitations to attend other
proms are streaming in.
   ``I think they've had a dozen invitations from high school proms
across the country,'' said Mrs. Washburn's husband of 19 years, Don.
   Jayme has said he and Mrs. Washburn have been friends about two
years and that he often joins her family, including Don Washburn
and four children, on social outings.
   ``She treats me as a friend and I treat her as a mother,'' he
said. Wessels' parents are divorced. He lives with his father,
while his mother lives in San Diego.
   Wessels said a Jacksonville, Fla., radio station is trying to
line up a prom for them, and one Chicago station has arranged for
the couple to attend a prom May 12. Both have agreed to pay for the
couple's airplane trip.
   ``I'm real excited about it,'' said Wessels. ``The only problem
is I have a landscaping project the following day for extra credit
at school. So, we're not sure where we're going.''

<TEXT>
   The new government of President Gen.
Andres Rodriguez announced Friday the retirement of 34 army
generals, including several close friends of ousted strongman Gen.
Alfredo Stroessner.
   In announcing the army retirements, the government said
Stroessner will be allowed to keep the honorary rank of general of
division. Stroessner ruled Paraguay for 34 years as president and
commander-in-chief of the army until ousted by Rodriguez in a Feb.
3 coup.
   Stroessner's eldest son Gustavo, an Air Force colonel who
accompanied his father into exile in neighboring Brazil after the
coup, was ordered cashiered for ``desertion,'' the government said.
   The retirement list, announced in a communique, included the
names of Stroessner collaborators Gen. Alejandro Fretes Davalos,
former army chief of staff; Gen. Gaspar Martinez, former defense
minister, Gen. Benito Guanes, former chief of military
intelligence; and Gen. Francisco Britez, former chief of police.
   Also included were Gen. Raul Calvet, former head of Lineas
Aereas Paraguayans, the national airline, and Gen. Francisco Ruiz
Diaz, former commander of the Presidential Escort Regiment, which
defended Stroessner during the violent coup.
   Rodriguez received 74 percent of the vote for president in
Monday's elections. Voters also chose a Senate and a House of
Deputies that will finish the 1988-1993 terms left vacant by the
coup.
   One of the new president's first acts Tuesday was to order a 70
percent pay increase for all military personel and a 30 percent
boost for all public employees.
   Under the new pay scale, a general of division, the highest
ranking officer, will earn the equivalent of $990 a month. A
sergeant first class will earn the equivalent of $167 monthly.

   A fire burned out of control in the
legislative palace for more than an hour before dawn Friday,
killing a security guard and destroying much of the huge,
marble-faced building, officials said.
   ``There is nothing left inside. Everything is charred,'' said
Radio Mil reporter Sergio Perdomo.
   Congressman Rogelio Montemayor said, ``All this is terrible,''
as he stood by an entrance strewn with shattered glass and the
fallen busts of Mexico's heroes.
   The federal attorney general's office discounted arson and said
the blaze broke out in the electrical system.
   Red Cross spokeswoman Leticia Calderon identified the victim as
Miguel Soriano, 33, who suffocated.
   Another guard, Juan Arias, was treated for smoke inhalation at
nearby Balbuena Hospital. Doctors said his condition is not serious.
   Nine hours after the fire broke out, plumes of dark smoke rose
from the San Lazaro palace. Fire officials said only embers
remained, and the fire was under control.
   Police superintendent Arturo Reyes Ojeda said a short-circuit
apparently started the fire in the main chamber, where national
deputies gather and where joint congressional sessions are held.
The fire destroyed the chamber, officials said.
   The national Senate meets in another part of Mexico City.
   The chief of the nearby Balbuena fire station faulted the
8-year-old smoke detection system.
   ``If those in charge of security had known right away there was
smoke in the building, they could have called the station, which is
one minute's drive away,'' Jose Luis Chavez said. ``The flames
would not have caused destruction of such magnitude.''
   The state news agency Notimex quoted Fire Chief Ignacio Ponce de
Leon as saying the fire damaged at least 40 percent of the palace.
At least 160 firefighters worked for more than an hour to bring it
under control.
   Perdomo said the chamber floor, which can seat more than 500
legislators, was a shambles. An ornate sculpted mural, about 60
feet long and 30 feet wide with 50 tons of bronze relief, was
destroyed, he said. Scorch marks marred the entrance to the
building, which was completed in 1981.

   A man with a pistol fatally shot a woman
Friday across the street from a school kindergarten pupils outside
for recess, then wounded two police officers before he was captured.
   Police said the suspect, identified as Dee Eastman, 25, had been
a high school classmate of the victim and had harassed her in the
past, but the motive was unclear. None of the children was injured.
   The shootings began shortly after noon in front of the Lafayette
School, when the suspect crashed his car head-on into a car driven
by the victim, according to police radio reports.
   A witness, Richard Beckner, said he heard the crash and looked
out the window of the plumbing shop where he works and saw the
woman's car spinning down the road.
   ``I saw a man carrying a handgun, walking fast toward the car,''
Beckner said. ``He put the gun inside the driver's window and shot
three times.''
   Jennifer Mesenbring, 25, of nearby Bourbonnais, suffered three
gunshot wounds and was pronounced dead a short time later at St.
Mary's Hospital, said hospital spokeswoman Diane Pellak. A second
young woman in the car escaped injury.
   ``She said to us that her friend, the driver, told her, `Oh, my
God, he's got a gun!','' Beckner said. ``So she rolled out of the
car and underneath.''
   The man fled, stole a pickup truck and headed toward a wooded
area along the Kankakee River. Police followed and a shootout
ensued, in which one officer was hit in the shoulder and the other
in the abdomen.
   Officer Jeff Hackley of the police department in nearby Bradley
was in critical condition at St. Mary's with a gunshot wound to the
pelvic area, and Officer Larry Osenga of the Kankakee Police
Department was in fair condition with a shoulder wound, said
hospital spokesman Dennis Yohnka.
   Eastman, also of Bourbonnais, was taken into custody and charged
with murder.
   Sgt. Bill Stark of the Bourbonnais Police Department said the
suspect has had previous run-ins with authorities and last month
kicked and dented a car Miss Mesenbring was driving.
   She told police at the time that Eastman had been harassing her
and that she had tried to avoid him.
   Lafayette Principal Avis Huff said 16 kindergarteners and their
teacher, Bonnie Gall, were in a playground across the street from
the crash scene.
   ``The teacher heard the noise, and when she heard breaking glass
she took immediate precautions like for a tornado,'' said Mrs. Huff.
   Ms. Gall ``told them to take action, cover their head and fall
to the ground, and then to move out,'' said Mrs. Huff.
   They were rushed inside the school and the doors were locked.

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Italian film company said Friday it has signed an
$80 million deal with a Soviet production company to produce three
films, including one on the Mongol conqueror Genghis Khan.
   Beppe Colombo, pesident of International Cinema Co., said a
two-part, four-hour epic entitled ``Genghis Khan'' would be the
first film produced in cooperation with the Soviet Cinema of
Perestroika.
   It will be directed by Tolomush Okeyev, whose 1975 film ``The
Fierce Wolf'' received an Oscar nomination for best foreign film.
   The producers said the title role in the $20 million film would
go to an American actor and that negotiations were underway with an
independent Los Angeles company to provide special effects. The
Italian firm will provide most of the financing for the three
films, Colombo added.
   Filming of ``Genghis Kahn'' will begin in January in the Soviet
Union and China, and is expected to last about a year. A six-hour
television version of the film will be released later for worldwide
distribution.
   Okeyev said Genghis Kahn, whose name has become synonymous with
ruthless barbarism during the 12th and 13th centuries, had always
been considered a ``negative figure'' in the Soviet Union.
   But he said that under perestroika, Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev's restructuring of Soviet society, Soviet officials have
allowed the lives of other historical figures to be reconsidered
without past prejudice.
   ``We want to tell the truth of how it really was,'' said Okeyev.
``It's impossible for a man on a horse to conquer as much territory
as he did without a brain.''
   The second film, ``The Silent Don'' is based on the epic novel
by Nobel laureate Mikhail Sholokov. It deals with the effects of
World War I and the Russian Revolution on the lives of the Don
Cossacks.
   The two-part film will be directed by Sergei Bondarciuk, who won
a 1968 foreign film Oscar for ``War and Peace,'' and later directed
``Waterloo'' and ``Ten Days That Shook the World,'' based on the
life of American journalist John Reed. Colombo said Paramount
studios would take part in the project, with will feature an
international cast.
   The third film, ``Tamerlane,'' will be directed by Ali Khamraev
and is based on the life of the 14th century Mongol conqueror who
claimed to be a descendant of Genghis Kahn.

   Nelson Mandela urged South
Africans to work for peace among themselves, said a colleague who
was allowed to visit the imprisoned black leader for five hours
Friday.
   Harry Gwala, terminally ill with a neurological disease, was
accompanied by his lawyer and a friend to see Mandela at the Victor
Verster prison farm outside Cape Town. He would not reveal who
initiated the meeting or give details, but he said part of the
conversation was about violence in Natal province.
   A senior Cabinet minister said Friday the government wants to
bring South Africa's black majority into Parliament and the
executive branch, but on condition that the white minority cannot
be overruled.
   Security for the 5 million whites can be ensured ``only in an
environment of progress, safety and justice for all the people of
South Africa,'' Chris Heunis, constitutional development minister,
said in a speech to Parliament.
   South Africa's 28 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs.
   Gwala, who lives in Natal, said Mandela gave him a message
saying South Africans should ``try and strive for peace among
themselves and to keep up their determination to bring about a new
South Africa.''
   He and Mandela, both 70, have been members of the African
National Congress since the 1940s. Until Gwala's release in
November, both were serving life sentences on convictions stemming
from their involvement with the outlawed guerrilla movement.
   Friday's meeting was their first since 1982, when Mandela was
moved from Robben Island prison to the Pollsmoor penitentiary.
Gwala told journalists he had not expected to see Mandela again
because ``we were doing life. We only had hope that we would see
each other in a free country.''
   Mandela apparently does not entertain hopes of beeing released
soon, Gwala said, but ``he seemed in good health. From what we had
heard he was very much improved.'' He said Mandela wore civilian
clothes and no guards observed their meeting.
   The Heunis speech in Parliament was a summary of proposals he
and other government officials have mentioned in recent months. He
said details of a new constitutional system must be negotiated and
offered few specifics of the new role envisioned for blacks.
   No black leaders have accepted the government's invitation to
constitutional negotiations. Militant blacks have rejected plans
put forth by Heunis, but some moderates have indicated they would
negotiate if the government freed Mandela, among others, and lifted
bans on black opposition groups.
   Speculation that Mandela would be freed after the Sept. 6
general elections increased with the Gwala visit. Previous efforts
to win his release have been blocked by the nationalist leader's
refusal to renounce violence in the campaign for majority rule.

<HEAD>Exiled Son of Haile Selassie Announces Ascension to Throne</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The exiled 73-year-old son of Emperor Haile
Selassie on Friday announced his ascension to the imperial throne
of Ethiopia, where a Marxist government rules.
   Wearing a blue Western-style suit and seated on a chair in his
London apartment, Ahma Selassie I and members of his
government-in-exile indicated they believe the regime now governing
their homeland will soon fall.
   ``There are many indications to show that the Ethiopian people
are desperate for a new system of government, a new democratic
organization,'' said Seife Michael Zewde, son-in-law of Ahma
Selassie and privy councilor to the throne.
   He said 3 million Ethiopians are in exile, the army has suffered
many defections, and the government is spending nearly 80 percent
of its budget on the military.
   The underdeveloped east African nation struggles with civil war
and periodic famine.
   Haile Selassie was deposed in 1974 by a military coup that
brought Lt. Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam to power. The emperor died
in captivity in Ethiopia in 1975.
   Members of the government-in-exile said Ahma Selassie would
normally have assumed the throne a year later. However, they said
he did not do so because of the chaos caused by the military
takeover.
   Ahma Selassie secretly accepted the throne on April 6, 1988, at
the request of two councils of state kings and elected officials,
said Zewde, who acted as interpreter.
   The public announcement was delayed over worries about the
safety of the government-in-exile, he said. It was to be made two
weeks ago, but no reporters came because of a London subway strike.
   Most foreign countries do not recognize the government-in-exile.

   Test pilot Frank ``Bud'' Kelley, one
of the first Americans to fly a jet plane, has died. He was 74.
   Kelley, who suffered a stroke last week, died Wednesday, his
family said.
   As a test pilot for Bell Aircraft Corp. Kelley flew an early
jet, the XP-59, on Nov. 16, 1942, over Muroc Dry Lake in the Mojave
Desert, according to Donald S. Lopez, deputy director of the
National Air and Space Museum.
   Kelley served in the Navy from 1935 to 1940, and took part in
the search for aviator Amelia Earhart in the Pacific while a pilot
flying from the aircraft carrier Lexington in 1937. She and her
plane were never found.
   Kelley's son, Pete, recalled that his father once crash-landed
in a Bell plane, electing not to bail out because he had ejected on
an earlier flight of the same plane.
   ``He would have rather died than bail out a second time,'' Pete
Kelley said.
   Kelley also worked for Vought-Sikorsky Aircraft and Hughes
Aircraft Co. He joined the Federal Aviation Administration in 1962
and worked in flight standards until his retirement in 1979.
   He is survived by his wife of 30 years, June, four children and
six grandchildren.

   An eighth-grade student broke a substitute

   The youth was charged as a juvenile with second-degree assault

Jerilynn Fierstein, a spokeswoman for the Yonkers School District.
   The 14-year-old at the Mark Twain Middle School told the teacher
that it was against his religion to say the pledge, said Deputy
Police Chief Rudolph DeDivitas.
   When the teacher insisted, the youth attacked the instructor,
landing several punches before another student intervened, said
DeDivitas.
   The teacher was taken to a hospital with a broken nose and
lacerations. Fierstein declined to identify the teacher or the
student and also declined to identify the student's religion.
   She described the teenager as ``a good kid in a good class.
Because of this, we're continuing our investigation. We consider
this an isolated incident.''

<TEXT>
   Coast Guard Commandant Paul A. Yost, in
charge of cleaning up the nation's largest oil spill, on Friday
told Exxon to put more crews to work and ``do whatever it takes''
to clean Alaska's fouled beaches.
   ``What I said to Exxon this morning is that they are going to
have to produce a significantly greater effort,'' the admiral said.
   ``That means an increase in the work unit productivity'' in
Exxon's revised proposal for cleanup operations this summer. Yost
must approve Exxon's clean-up plan before it goes into effect, but
said he has not yet made a decision.
   Earlier this week, Yost criticized the plan as poorly drafted
and lacking in specifics. The state also has criticized it and
urged extensive changes. But on Friday, he called the plan
``workable ... but it needs expansion.''
   Yost was chosen by President Bush to supervise the cleanup of
the March 24 spill, when the tanker Exxon Valdez slammed into a
reef and poured more than 10 million gallons of Alaska crude into
Prince William Sound.
   ``Some of the cleanup is difficult to the point that one wonders
if restoration will ever be possible,'' Yost said.
   ``Restoration will probably be done by the Lord in the next few
years. I don't think restoration is going to be done by Exxon in
the next few months on all of the beaches. It's not possible.''
   A state official said that half of the oil in Alaskan waters has
dissipated, and much of what's left has been churned into a
taffylike goo and tossed up on beaches.
   ``Exactly how that's going to be dealt with I don't know,'' said
Bill Lamoreaux, an environmentalist with the Alaska Department of
Environmental Conservation. ``A lot of it is tar balls. The cleanup
procedures are going to have to be tailored.''
   After a wind- and rain-swept six-hour tour of the area late
Thursday, Vice President Dan Quayle said he believes ``Exxon's
going to have to do more than they think they're going to have to
do.''
   Quayle, returning from a 12-day Pacific tour, met with a group
of Cordova residents before heading to the USS Juneau, a Navy ship
used as a base of operations for part of the spill cleanup, and to
Smith Island.
   Accompanied by his wife, Marilyn, and joined by Yost and U.S.
Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner, Quayle abandoned a wooden
platform built specially for his visit, and tried his hand at
hosing some of the oil off a rocky beach.
   ``It's going to be an enormous effort,'' he said after looking
at the blackened island, an important resting and birthing area for
seals.
   The tanker Exxon Valdez slammed into a reef in Prince William
Sound on March 24, causing the nation's largest oil spill and
sullying hundreds of miles of Alaska coastline.
   Under Exxon's proposal, 364 miles of coastline will be cleansed
by Sept. 15, although nearly 200 of those miles may be left
untouched _ to be scoured by wind and wave action.
   The plan also seeks to dispose of waste by burying it, burning
it or discharging it through a wastewater treatment plant in
Valdez. The company has asked for permission to bypass some
environmental laws in order to dispose of the wastes.
   In other developments Friday:
   _The lawyer for Joseph Hazelwood said the fired tanker captain
was not drunk when he left the vessel in command of his third mate
prior to the shipwreck.
   Hazelwood left the bridge to do paperwork in his cabin below,
which was part of his normal routine, attorney Michael Chalos told
reporters after a brief court proceeding at Suffolk County Court in
New York.
   Chalos asserted the accident could have been prevented had the
Coast Guard been monitoring the vessel, as was its responsibility.
   Hazelwood, 42, of Huntington, N.Y., surrendered to Alaskan
authorities this week on three misdemeanor charges of operating a
vessel while intoxicated, reckless endangerment and negligent
discharge of oil.
   His attorneys were in court to formally request that the
fugitive from justice warrant issued last month be canceled. Judge
Edward Green granted the request.
   _The Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. in Valdez, which pipes oil to
tankers from the trans-Alaska pipeline, said it will require that
tankers leaving Valdez be escorted by special, 200-foot-long
spill-recovery boats.
   ``Under the new plan, every tanker leaving Port Valdez will be
escorted by a tug and a large emergency response vessel loaded with
oil containment and recovery equipment,'' said George M. Nelson,
president of the company.

   The Central Park jogger brutalized by a pack of
roving teen-agers conquered a fever Friday and continued to mend
slowly, doctors said.
   Although the cause of her 106-degree fever on Thursday was not
determined, ``we're gratified, as of today, that none of the
potential sources of this fever has turned out to be exceedingly
dangerous,'' said Dr. Robert Kurtz, director of the surgical
intensive care unit.
   The patient's temperature dropped from 100.1 to 99.8 on Friday
afternoon. A CAT scan showed no abscess or meningitis. But some
medications were changed to counter the ``distant possibility''
that they had caused the fever, said Kurtz.
   The 28-year-old woman was resting comfortably and showed some
neurological progress, although she tired easily, had a short
attention span and was disoriented, Kurtz said in a statement.
   The Wall Street investment banker, who was in a coma for two
weeks after she was beaten and raped on April 19, regained
consciousness Tuesday, speaking in a hoarse whisper to relatives
and staff members. Her condition has remained critical despite her
progress.
   Six teen-agers have been indicted on charges of attempted
murder, rape, sodomy and assault in her case. On Friday, those six
youths and two others were indicted on charges of assaulting a male
jogger during the crime spree that culminated in the attack on the
woman.
   The alleged attackers were among more than 30 youths who went to
the park for a night of ``wilding'' _ random attacks on anyone they
encountered while roaming the area, police said.

<TEXT>
   South African troops will remain on
patrol in northern Namibia until May 13 to make sure all SWAPO
guerrillas have left the territory, officials said Friday.
   The statements by Louis Pienaar, South African-appointed
administrator-general of Namibia, and Pik Botha, South Africa's
foreign minister, followed a comment by U.N. Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar urging that South African soldiers be
restricted to barracks immediately because police could handle the
situation.
   South Africa has agreed to implementation of a U.N. plan leading
to elections in November and independence for the territory South
Africa has ruled for 74 years. The plan is tied to an agreement
among South Africa, Cuba and Angola that guerrillas of the
South-West African People's Organization remain in their bases in
Angola until their scheduled return to Namibia as unarmed refugees
in June.
   The U.N. plan was interrupted April 1, when hundreds of
guerrillas crossed into Namibia. South African forces were released
from their bases and more than 300 men died in the subsequent
fighting.
   Pienaar told a news conference Cuba, Angola and South Africa
agreed at Cape Town meetings last weekend that South African troops
could spend until May 13 sweeping northern Namibia for guerrillas
and arms caches. Pienaar said about 300 SWAPO fighters still were
in the area and flushing them out would require considerable
military manpower.

   A winery worker accused of killing his
wife, two of their daughters and four other people in a bloody
rampage pleaded innocent Friday to charges that could send him to
the gas chamber.
   Ramon Salcido, 28, looked glum and unkempt as he entered the
innocent pleas to seven counts of murder and three counts of
attempted murder in connection with an April 14 crime spree through
the wine country north of San Francisco.
   And an expression of sympathy for a victim of that spree emerged
from an unlikely place, with hundreds of prisoners at the Sonoma
County jail collecting $900 during two ``days of peace'' for
Salcido's 3-year-old daughter, Carmina, who survived a cut throat
allegedly inflicted by her father.
   ``I've had enough of violence, and what was done to her was pure
evil,'' said Gabriel Menjou, 42, serving time at the jail on a
forgery conviction.
   ``I wanted her to know that men don't have to be mean and cruel,
but to know that they can be loving, kind and caring,'' said Menjou.
   Salcido in an isolation cell at the jail charged with killing
Carmina's mother and two sisters, his mother-in-law and her two
young daughters, and a winery worker he told detectives he believed
was having an affair with his wife.
   He also is charged with the attempted murder of Carmina, whose
throat was cut, and trying to shoot to death two other people.
   In court Friday, about 20 sheriff's deputies stood guard inside
and outside the courtroom, searching bags and passing metal
detectors over spectators as they came in.
   Salcido listened to the proceedings through a court-provided
Spanish interpreter but answered the judge in English, saying
``Yes, your honor,'' in a barely audible voice.
   In addition to pleading innocent to all the charges, Salcido
denied an allegation of multiple murder, a special circumstance
that if proved could result in a sentence of death or life in
prison without possibility of parole.
   Municipal Court Judge Knoel Owen set a date of Sept. 11 for a
preliminary hearing and refused to lift a gag order he imposed
earlier in the case.
   The fund raising for Carmina was the idea of an inmate
counseling group run by the Rev. Bob Gutleben, the jail's
unofficial chaplain. He had noted that inmates often have an
unwritten code calling for the maiming or murder of pedophiles and
child murderers.
   ``In trying to help inmates deal with some of the really heavy
hatred they've directed at Ramon, we posed the question, thinking
about Carmina: What would be most helpful, to assure her you as
inmates would kill her daddy, or something else,'' said Gutleben.
   ``We asked them instead to give the gift that killers would not
give _ the gift of non-violence,'' he added.
   Gutleben said he was shocked by the inmates' outpouring of
concern for the child. Numerous prisoners who have only $1.50 in
their jail accounts gave $1 to the fund, and several gave the full
amount.
   Those who donated gave an average of half their savings, he
estimated.
   ``These guys dug down to every cent they literally had in their
pockets. They are going to go without cigarettes and other basic
necessities because they want to reach out of their anger and
despair and direct something positive to Carmina,'' Gutleben said.
   Gutleben, who runs Sebastopol-based Covenant Connection, a
non-denominational ministry to inmates and ex-convicts, said 90
percent of the jail's 690 prisoners participated in the collection
drive and the two-day pledge of non-violence.
   Sheriff's deputies have been concerned about the safety of
28-year-old Salcido since he was captured in Mexico April 19. He
was brought to the county jail the next night, where a furious
crowd of 200 people shouted ``Kill him.''
   Weather stripping was added to his cell door to prevent inmates
from slipping anything harmful inside. Authorities also put up a
large metal plate to keep inmates from looking into Salcido's cell
through a window.
   Whenever he is moved from this third-floor cell _ for showers,
exercise or court appointments _ all of the 50 to 60 inmates on the
floor are confined to their cells. Salcido also is accompanied by
three guards.
   Twenty-four hour supervision, which also serves as a suicide
watch, is provided by an officer watching Salcido through a window
in the wall of his cell.
   Carmina has been showered by hundreds of gifts at Petaluma
Valley Hospital and donations have poured into a trust fund set up
for her. Carmina's grandfather, who has applied for custody, has
not disclosed how much has been raised.

   A ban on campaigning went into effect
here Friday, two days before presidential and congressional
elections in which former military dictator Hugo Banzer Suarez is
expected to emerge as president.
   Ten parties are competing in the elections. Besides the
presidency, all 27 Senate seats and all 130 seats in the House of
Deputies are at stake.
   About two dozen foreign observers are on hand, most of them from
Latin American countries and organizations. Foreign diplomats said,
however, that they did not expect any widespread fraud.
   Electoral officials distributed ballot boxes, freshly painted a
pale green, and numbered, multicolored ballots on Friday to polling
places in school gymnasiums and other public buildings.
   ``Everything is ready for Sunday,'' Mauro Cuellar, president of
the National Electoral Court, told The Associated Press in a
telephone interview. ``Voting material will be distributed to all
polling places today and tomorrow.''
   Under Bolivian law, all campaigning must halt two full days
before balloting.
   Police were out in force late Thursday night, controlling the
streets as party activists staged last-minute rallies and marches.
No heavy security presence was evident on Friday, but officers
guarded polling places.
   The independent Permanent Human Rights Assembly of Bolivia asked
its ranks to ``monitor the voting process and denounce any attempts
at fraud.'' It said its effort was aimed mainly ``at marginal city
neighborhoods and rural areas.''
   The presidential front-runner in most polls was Banzer, 62, a
retired army general and standard-bearer of the rightist National
Democratic Action. The two other major candidates are industrialist
Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, 58, of the conservative Revolutionary
Nationalist Movement and Jaime Paz Zamora, 50, a former vice
president, of the Social Democratic Movement of the Revolutionary
Left.
   None is expected to win more than 50 percent of the total vote.
In such a case, congress is given authority to choose the president
from among the top three finishers when it convenes Aug. 4.
   Banzer finished first in the last presidential election in 1985,
with 28.6 percent of the vote, but congress picked runner-up Victor
Paz Estenssoro, with 26.4 percent, to be president. Paz Estenssoro,
now 81, is retiring from politics.
   Banzer seized power in a 1971 coup that toppled a leftist
military dictatorship and ruled until 1978, when popular pressure
forced him to call elections.

   Airborne Angolan army units destroyed an
important rebel base in northern Angola, killing 19 insurgents and
capturing about 200, a Portuguese news report said Friday.
   The report comes during a suspension in offensive action by the
U.S.-backed rebels. The National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola, or UNITA, has said it will attack government forces only
if provoked.
   The news agency Lusa, monitored in Lisbon, said 200 government
soldiers attacked the rebel base at Pipanema in Malange province,
about 125 miles from the Zaire. It did not say when the attack
occurred.
   Government forces flew there in ten Soviet-built helicopters
that showered the rebels with heavy fire before the army units
landed, said the report.
   The Pipanema base was headquarters for 1,000 guerrillas, Lusa
said.
   Citing Angolan army sources, the report said 19 rebels died and
about 200 were captured in the attack.
   In Lisbon, a UNITA spokesman said he knew nothing of the attack.
   The rebels have been fighting to force Angola's Marxist
government to share power.

<TEXT>
   Alexander Mogilny, the first member of the
Soviet National Team to defect to the West, arrived Friday night in
Buffalo, where he hopes to continue his hockey career with the
NHL's Buffalo Sabres.
   Sabres General Manager Gerry Meehan accompanied Mogilny from
Stockholm, Sweden, after the budding Soviet star decided to defect
following the World Hockey Championships, which ended earlier this
week.
   Mogilny, regarded as one of the Soviets' future stars, was
supposed to appear at a news conference called by the Sabres, but
Meehan said the 20-year-old winger was tired from the trip and
interviews with immigration officials.
   ``His day has been so tiring, we didn't want to put him through
another exhausting round of exposure,'' said Meehan, who declined
to say where Mogilny was staying.
   Meehan also denied an accusation by the official Soviet news
agency Tass that the Sabres were guilty of ``piracy'' in bringing
Mogilny to the United States.
   ``The Buffalo Sabres were totally open and above-board'' in
dealing with Mogilny, he said. The Sabres began talks with Mogilny
``at the specific request of the player,'' Meehan said. ``It was a
voluntary departure.''
   Meehan would not say whether Mogilny had signed a contract and
also declined comment on published reports that indicated a
romantic relationship with an American woman may have been involved
in the defection.
   Meehan admitted there are potential problems with international
ice hockey officials, the NHL and American immigration officials
that could keep Mogilny from playing for Buffalo.
   ``I wouldn't say they (his chances of playing with Buffalo) are
pretty good or pretty bad,'' he said ``There are hurdles that have
to be resolved.''
   Soviet coach Viktor Tikhonov said the defection cast a shadow
over attempts by other Soviet players to sign with NHL teams.
   Soviet coach Viktor Tikhonov said he was disgusted by the
defection and said it cast a shadow over attempts by other Soviet
hockey players to sign with NHL teams.
   Vyacheslav Koloskov, head of the soccer and hockey department of
the State Sports Committee, said in an interview published Friday
in the government daily Izvestia he expected no serious
repercussions in Soviet-NHL relations.
   Mogilny was accompanied on the flight from Stockholm by Meehan
and Don Luce, the Sabres' director of amateur development.
   Upon his arrival, Mogilny, who was a member of the Central Red
Army team, was interviewed at the airport by the FBI. ``They do
that with all defectors,'' said Tom Middlemiss, of the Port
Authority of New York &amp; New Jersey.
   Meehan said Mogilny first contacted the Sabres by phone on
Tuesday, then met with Meehan and Luce in Sweden the following day.
   ``I had no idea he wanted to come on Tuesday. It happened very
fortuitively,'' he said. He said the Sabres did not contact the NHL
before meeting with Mogilny.
   Meehan said many details, including presumbly Mogilny's status
as a Soviet defector, had to be worked out, but he said there was
plenty of time, since the start of the next NHL season is five
months away.
   ``We hope he'll be able to play next year,''he said.
   Meehan refused to discuss any details about a contract or
Mogilny's status with immigration or whether he had been granted
asylum.
   A U.S. Embassy spokesman said Mogilny, who helped the Soviet
Union to its 21st world hockey title last week, was granted a U.S.
visa on Thursday.
   Mogilny was in his third year with the Red Army team and played
11 international matches with the Soviet national team before this
season. He was voted the world's best junior player by NHL scouts
in a poll organized by The Hockey News.
   But the right wing had his troubles with Soviet hockey
authorities. He was suspended for 10 days before the world
championships after a fight in a Soviet league game.
   A Swedish newspaper reported last week that Mogilny had a
month's salary withdrawn and lost his ``Master of Sports'' order.
   He was also quoted by Aftonbladet newspaper as saying he was not
interested in a military career. ``I want to do something else with
my life,'' he was quoted as saying.
   Mogilny's role as a junior lieutenant in the Soviet Army added a
further diplomatic complication. Soviet authorities could view the
incident as desertion.

<TEXT>
   Musicians from the United States and the Soviet
Union will perform Aug. 12 in a globally televised concert for
Armenian earthquake relief, the Turner Broadcasting System and
Jesse Jackson announced Friday.
   The concert will be ``an eight-hour, massive global appeal'' to
raise money for the redevelopment of Armenia, Jackson said. It will
be televised from New York's Apollo Theatre, from Armenia and
possibly from Los Angeles, he added.
   TBS President Robert Wussler said there are still ``many
hurdles'' to clear before the event, which is to be broadcast
exclusively in the United States on the TBS ``SuperStation'' seen
via cable television.
   Turner Program Services, another Turner Broadcasting operation,
will handle global syndication, Wussler said.
   Jackson, asked repeatedly if any artists have signed on for the
concert, did not specifically respond, but said he is optimistic
that Soviet restrictions on some forms of pop music will not be a
problem in putting together the concert lineup.
   Soviet television officials are involved in the planning, and
what remains is ``working out the technical stuff,'' Jackson said.
   Jackson announced the concert during remarks to a meeting of
international contributors to the ``CNN World Report,'' shown on
Cable News Network.
   Jackson said he proposed the concert idea during a visit he made
to Armenia in January after the devastating Dec. 7 earthquake that
killed an estimated 25,000 people.

   An explosion caused by confiscated fireworks
shattered a downtown fire station Friday and injured at least 39
people, officials said.
   ``It was so sudden. I thought that a bomb had exploded,'' said
one fireman who did not give his name. He was about 30 feet away at
the time.
   The fire station is only four blocks from Mexico's Legislative
Palace, which was severely damaged by a fire earlier in the day.
   The Red Cross said eight injured firemen and one civilian were
taken to hospitals by Red Cross ambulances after the early evening
blast.
   Saul Escobedo Ramirez, chief of ambulances at the police rescue
service, said their ambulances picked up 30 injured _ 23
firefighters and seven civilians.
   Carlos Esperanza Garcia, chief doctor at the nearby Hospital
Ruben Lenero, said five people were taken there with burns.
   Fire official Roberto Jaime Rangel said 15 tons of fireworks had
been stored outdoors at the fire station. He blamed the explosion
on ``overheating.''
   Fire Chief I. Ponce de Leon said the fireworks had been seized
in nearby markets and stored at the station for about six weeks. He
said the army routinely picks up seized fireworks and disposes of
them, but for some reason hadn't done so before the blast.
   Anne LaBrousse, a witness who arrived at the scene shortly after
the explosion, said windows were shattered in buildings near the
one-story fire station and that some interior walls had been blown
down. She said a huge cloud of white smoke rose over the scene.
   The blast was heard 10 blocks away in the Zocalo, Mexico City's
central square, where supporters of leftist politician Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas had gathered for a rally.

<HEAD>`Approaching Zanzibar,' A Play by Tina Howe, Opens Off-Broadway</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: No PMs planned.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tina Howe's ``Approaching Zanzibar,'' which
opened Thursday at off-Broadway's Second Stage, is a life-affirming
meditation on death.
   If that sounds a bit contradictory, so is Miss Howe's sad, funny
and beautifully written new play. In it, the playwright chronicles
the 2,000-mile journey by a suburban New York family to the New
Mexico bedside of a dying aunt.
   But their trip is not the shortest distance between two points.
The play tells the story of their automobile trip, but it also
involves circuitous flights of fancy that might make more
literal-minded members of the audience scratch their heads.
   ``Approaching Zanzibar'' represents a change for Miss Howe from
her more naturalistic, straightforward dramas such as ``Painting
Churches'' and ``Coastal Disturbances.''
   Like ``Painting Churches,'' the play celebrates family, and not
just the husband, wife, son and daughter who make the journey, but
everyone they meet along the way including a man and his newborn
son, a grandmother and her deaf grandson and the wife's brother and
his pregnant wife. They all seem to be related in a mystical,
other-worldly way.
   The husband (Harris Yulin) is a composer stymied by creative
block. His wife (Jane Alexander) faces the end of her child-bearing
years. Between hot flashes, she hears the cries of a lost baby,
perhaps a child she now will never have. Their son is a classical
guitar prodigy, and the boy's younger sister is a precocious
9-year-old who becomes the family's link to the old aunt.
   Miss Howe has an odd, quirky style that constantly surprises,
but she also has an ear for the mundane conversation of family
life. She perfectly captures the squabbling between husband and
wife, brother and sister and parents and children. In one
hilarious, topsy-turvy scene, the playwright has the children
playing their parents while the parents are the children. The
actors handle their role reversals with astonishing ease.
   The author also brings to life the special relationships between
these people. There's a magical moment at the end of Act 1 when
brother and sister, left alone at a campsite, are afraid. But
gradually their sense of wonder takes over as the boy plays his
guitar, the girl waves a brightly colored circus light and they
both gaze at the stars.
   The same delight in life occurs near the end of the play when
the young girl and her dying aunt, a painter who resembles Georgia
O'Keeffe, reach an understanding. They trade information on their
favorite color, animal and lucky number. The old woman dreamily
recalls a romantic trip she made from Paris to Zanzibar.
   It's these memories of past good times that pervade the play,
but they are not maudlin. Miss Howe is not afraid to laugh in the
face of death, and her characters have a good time as they make
their way across the country to pay tribute to the dying woman.
   Miss Alexander and Yulin capture the anxiety of middle age as
one parent discovers his career at a dead end and the other finds
her job becoming obsolete. Director Carole Rothman coaxes
unmannered performances from the two children, Clayton Barclay
Jones as the son and Angela Goethals as the daughter. They are
exasperating, lovable, mean, perceptive, funny and just about
perfect in their portrayals.
   Most of the other acting is adequate, although Bethel Leslie
seems too young and healthy to play the grievously ill, 81-year-old
aunt.
   Miss Rothman has given the play an inventive production, nine
scenes that take place in wildly divergent settings. They include a
sailboat racing across an Oklahoma lake and a mountain stream in
North Carolina where father and son fish. Set designer Heidi
Landesman has no trouble conjuring up both on the theater's tiny
stage.
   Near the end of the play, the wife ruminates about life and
pretty much sums up what the playwright is trying to say.
   ``You dance through childhood, race through the teen-age years,
fall in love a few million times, bear some delicious bald babies
and then, whhhstt, it's all over,'' she opines.
   ``Approaching Zanzibar'' makes that journey an exhilarating and
at times poignant ride.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III,
offering the broadest view yet of how the Bush administration will
deal with the Soviet Union, says the United States plans to test
Moscow ``again and again'' to see whether it will live up to its
promises of reform.
   ``By testing Moscow across the board ... we can see whether the
`new thinking' is real once we get beyond the slogans,'' Baker said
in a speech on Thursday to the Center for Strategic and
International Studies.
   Baker departs Monday for his first round of talks with Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev and Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
in Moscow.
   At the May 10-11 session, they are expected to set a date for
the resumption of negotiations to reduce long-range nuclear
missiles and make preliminary arrangements for a summit between
Gorbachev and President Bush.

official media reported today.
   Students marched by the tens of thousands to occupy the square
Thursday and rally for more freedom. Some returned to class today
to end a two-week boycott but student leaders at Beijing University

   The rich, infectious singing style of
Thokoza may have an exotic name _ ingom'esbusku, but the South
African harmonies are familiar to American music lovers.
   The four women who make up Thokoza (Zulu for happiness) are
accompanied by traditional drums, and the band Bayeza (they are
coming) which re-creates the bouncy, guitar-driven sound of South
Africa's black townships.
   The result, punctuated by distinctly African ululations and the
``click sounds'' of the Zulu language, hints of the
``call-and-response'' style of American gospel, the emotion of
blues and the energy of jazz improvisation.
   The group once shared the bill with a gospel quartet led by a
staid 78-year-old minister who at first looked askance at Thokoza's
brightly colored African costumes, recalled Thuli Dumakude, the
group's lead singer.
   ``After we sang, the reverend came and said, `Wow, was that
gospel? I couldn't tell because of the language.' But he heard the
spirit,'' she said. ``The music broke the ice, we started relating
to each other.''
   Ingom'esbusku (night music) is gaining a new, international
audience thanks in part to Grammy-winning Ladysmith Black Mambazo,
the South African group that recorded the ``Graceland'' LP with
Paul Simon.
   At a recent concert in Newark, the singers wore black dresses
with splashes of brightly patterned cloth tied around their waists
and hair, and white canvas shoes that flashed like semaphore as
they moved in quick, high steps.
   ``South African dancing is more like the sound of the drum,''
said Dumakude. ``The footwork is just complementing the drums.''
   Dumakude, whose quiet speaking voice contrasts with her soaring,
emotional singing, is the only Thokoza member born in South Africa.
Linda Carter is from Orange, N.J.; Amma Oloriwaa and Ghanneiyya
Green were born in New York.
   ``South Africans will come backstage to talk to the performers.
They ask, `Which part of home are you from?' And the people say,
`I'm from Brooklyn,''' said Welcome Msomi, Dumakude's husband and
Thokoza's producer.
   ``There are some of us who only came in 1979, and there are
others who have been here for hundreds of years. But still, we are
Africans,'' said Msomi, who occasionally adds a bass line to
Thokoza and writes some of its songs.
   ``Even though we can't trace our roots, maybe by singing we can
hear where we came from,'' Oloriwaa said. ``If you have a deep,
guttural gospel sound, then maybe your people came from South
Africa. If it's high, maybe it's West Africa.''
   Thokoza's repertoire includes traditional African songs as well
as original pieces that often call for social and political change
in racially torn South Africa.
   The group recently completed several concerts on the East Coast
_ including performances at New York's Town Hall and Atlanta's
Symphony Hall _ with a Gambian balladeer, a gospel choir and Puerto
Rican plena and bomba band in a show called the African Heritage
Tour. Thokoza also performed at 25 elementary and high schools in
the New York area last year, and on college campuses in Missouri,
Illinois and California.
   The group grew from the theater that Dumakude and Msomi founded
in 1979 in the largely black Bedford-Stuyvesant section of
Brooklyn. Msomi started the original IZulu Theater in 1965 in
Durban, South Africa. In 1977, the Royal Shakespeare Company
brought IZulu to London to stage ``Umbatah,'' which Msomi describes
as a Zulu version of Shakespeare's ``Macbeth.''
   ``Umbatah'' later played at the Spoleto Festival in Charleston,
S.C., where it was seen by producers who offered to stage it in New
York.
   ``When the show closed (in New York), I made up my mind that I
was going to start up a branch of the theater in the United
States,'' Msomi said. ``I love the challenge.''
   Msmoi and Dumakude began with Zulu dance and language classes,
nurturing an interest in African culture among U.S. blacks that
allowed the South African couple to build a company. The plays they
produced often included song and dance.
   ``As we were growing, people began demanding to hear more of the
music,'' Msomi said. ``Then, when Paul Simon came out with
`Graceland,' people started to discover South African music. People
started to demand South African music, then Thokoza started to
develop.''
   ``Graceland'' was named album of the year in 1986, and Ladysmith
Black Mambazo went on to capture its own Grammy for best
traditional folk album, ``Shaka Zulu,'' a year later.
   Dumakude had at first planned to find other South Africans for
Thokoza. In South Africa, she had been taught that blacks in the
United States were not African, and she had found that many black
Americans were unaware of, or unwilling to acknowledge, their ties
to her home.
   ``It has always been a plan to divide us,'' she said. ``I was
looking for someone who would say, `I am an African-American.''
   Msomi believes blacks in the United States have been influenced
by negative media images of Africa. ``Through the music, we can
also educate other people. We are the ones to bring out the truth.''

   Pat Taylor isn't a Texan anymore, but some
traits remain _ the boots, the hat, the tendency to do everything
in a big way.
   The oilman began footing college bills for individual students
some time back. A year ago, he told a couple hundred underachieving
seventh- and eighth-graders he'd see to it they could go to college
if they kept up their grades. Now he wants everybody in Louisiana
who makes the grades to be able to go.
   ``We have tax-supported colleges in this state that everyone
pays for, but they are just for those families who can afford
tuition, room and board,'' said Taylor. ``Nothing is as bizarre in
this day and time as to turn a kid who is qualified for college
away just because he doesn't have a few thousand dollars to pay for
it.''
   A self-made millionaire who left home at 16 and worked his way
through Louisiana State University, Taylor believes the opportunity
to go to college is the key to solving a lot of the nation's
problems.
   ``It would cut the number of people in prison, the number on
welfare, the number selling and using drugs. People would see a
chance at a future and they wouldn't waste it. You can't expect
kids to do well in school if they feel they have nowhere to go,''
he said.
   ``I used to believe ours is an equal opportunity society and
that we are the only truly classless society in the world. Now I
know that isn't true. We have two classes in this country _ those
with a chance and those without.''
   Taylor, a Horatio Alger Award recipient, frequently gave
motivational speeches about his rise from poverty. He was asked to
talk to the Livingston Middle School on March 16, 1988, and thought
he'd give the same talk.
   ``My staff told me that wouldn't work. These were kids who had
failed two or three years and were going to drop out of school,''
he said.
   ``They said they were in a salvage operation and I was supposed
to try to convince them to stay in school and graduate.''
   What Taylor saw at the school were young men and women who were
totally tuned out. But he got their attention:
   ``I laid it on pretty thick. I went in my full regalia, Rolex
and all. I talked about my racing boats and ranches and I told them
how I got it _ through hard work and a college education. I told
them I had one advantage they didn't. I was white and in East Texas
when I was young that was important. I also told them it doesn't
make that much difference now.''
   Taylor also told them that if they would make a ``B'' or better
in high school, he would pay for their college education. ``It was
the first time I realized that they didn't have that opportunity
before I gave it to them. I had always thought anyone who had the
grades could go to college. I was wrong.''
   One of the students in that group was Eric Fisher. ``I didn't
think he could do it at first. That's a lot of money. My folks were
in shock too. There are five of us kids and when Mr. Taylor said
he'd pay for my college they were some happy,'' said Fisher, who
hopes to become a political cartoonist.
   ``My attitude has really changed,'' said Clenard Pruitt, another
of the students. ``Used to be I didn't study that much. Now I have
a plan to go to college and then go into real estate. That's where
the money is.''
   The ``Taylor Plan'' that grew out of Taylor's revelation would
let Louisiana students attend college based solely on ability to
learn. It would require four-year colleges to adopt minimum
admission standards. Each qualified student whose family income is
less than $30,000 a year would be guaranteed a college education
with tuition, fees, room and board costs all waived.
   Taylor put the cost of the program at $20 million the first
year, and believes the savings it would generate would pay for it.
Simply eliminating remedial courses at four-year schools because of
the admission standards would save millions, he said.
   The Louisiana Board of Regents, which oversees nine regional
colleges, and the Louisiana State University Board have accepted
the plan. It officially goes into effect in 1993, but both boards
have said any student meeting the academic requirements this fall
will have fees and tuition waived at 13 colleges. Those costs will
be absorbed by the colleges.
   A bill is pending in the Legislature to cover those costs and
room and board when the program officially begins. Officials, like
Taylor, believe that the program will be self-sustaining.
   As proof of what his plan can do, Taylor points to the 172 who
took him up on his college offer at Livingston Middle School last
year. A year later, none have dropped out or gotten into drugs,
there's been one pregnancy and one arrest, and the rest are all
maintaining a ``B'' average or better.
   ``The biggest thing the program has done is keep these kids in
school. Most of them would have dropped out by now if Mr. Taylor
hadn't stepped in,'' said Marie Carter, who supervises the program.
``These are kids who had failed at least twice, maybe three times.
They came from broken homes, had behavior problems, attitude
problems, many of them just weren't wanted by anyone.''
   ``It means a lot to me,'' Taylor said. ``I know what it's like
to be poor and be afraid you won't be able to get the education. I
know the fear of thinking you might miss the chance to be all you
can be.
   ``Can you think of anything worse than to be bright and be
condemned to a life of menial work?''

<HEAD>Unlikely Partners Form New Production Company</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Will PKE become the MTM of the future?
   The new production venture is a product of the unlikely
partnership of Tom Patchett, creator of NBC's wise-cracking puppet
star ``ALF,'' and Ken Kaufman, producer of such serious,
made-for-television fare as ``The Attic: The Hiding of Anne Frank''
and ``In the Line of Duty: The FBI Murders.''
   The ``PKE'' in PKE Productions stands for Patchett-Kaufman
Entertainment.
   MTM Productions, named for co-founder Mary Tyler Moore, is the
company that became legendary for such high-quality hits as ``The
Mary Tyler Moore Show,'' ``Hill Street Blues'' and ``St.
Elsewhere.'' Patchett worked there with partner Jay Tarses on
several series, including ``The Bob Newhart Show.''
   Patchett and Kaufman met when they teamed up a few years ago on
``Washingtoon,'' a short-lived, political-satire cable series. They
remained in touch, though their paths diverged. Kaufman recalled
that on the day he got approval for ``Anastasia,'' a two-part movie
for NBC, Patchett got the go-ahead for ``ALF.''
   Patchett has independently produced ``ALF'' since its premiere
three seasons ago, but with success under his belt, he began to
think big.
   ``I asked Ken, how do you run a company?'' Patchett said in an
interview in Kaufman's office at their new company headquarters in
suburban Culver City. ``The best company I ever worked for was MTM
when Grant Tinker was there, and we just had a wonderful creative
bunch of people and there were five, six shows going at one time,
and it was really wonderful. But you've got to be a manager to do
that at the top someplace. I knew Ken could run a company, and I
asked him for his advice, and sort of couched in that was the
invitation to sort of go in together.''
   In March, PKE was still a chain of sparsely furnished offices in
a non-descript building.
   ``When I came in here Jan. 3, there was me and the answering
machine,'' Kaufman said. ``On the answering machine, it said,
`Hello, this is Patchett-Kaufman Entertainment. We're not here
right now. Could you please leave a message?' And the first message
I got was him (Patchett) calling, saying, `Hello. Kaufman's not
there? Well, I'm Patchett, and I'm not there. You guys must be
doing very well.'''
   But Kaufman proudly showed off the stadium-sized warehouse soon
to be filled with soundstages and dressing rooms and the bustle of
work on new projects ranging from a fact-based movie about the
Howard Beach, N.Y., racial attack to ``Working Girl,'' a new NBC
sitcom based on the hit movie of the same name.
   Kaufman, who recently moved to Los Angeles from New York, had
made a name producing Important-with-a-capital-I movies with his
late partner, Michael Lepiner.
   Patchett had a string of critical if not ratings successes with
Tarses, including NBC's ``Buffalo Bill.'' The strain of the series
split up the partnership.
   Tarses went on to create the offbeat dramedies ``The Days and
Nights of Molly Dodd'' and ``The `Slap' Maxwell Story.'' Patchett
went on to ``ALF,'' his first bona fide ratings hit. The show has
spawned an industry of stuffed toys, lunch boxes and other ``ALF''
paraphernalia.
   No one, apparently, was more surprised by its almost
instantaneous success than was Patchett:
   ``The scary part is the responsibility that comes with a hit
like that. ... When you get phone calls that, you know, a husband
is dying and he's in a coma and the only thing he responds to is
ALF ... and somebody dies and they bury the kid with an ALF doll or
cap ... you gotta be careful. It's very _ you begin to feel what
humanity is all about, because you have such power.''
   PKE's logo is a house, which Kaufman describes as symbolizing a
protective roof over the heads of the creative types he and
Patchett hope to attract. It's to some extent the house that
``ALF'' built.
   ```ALF' is affording this venture,'' said Patchett. ``It's not
bankrolling it, but it's certainly made it possible for me to do
something that I hadn't thought of being able to do before.''

<HEAD>Val Kilmer Plays a New Version of Billy the Kid</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Val Kilmer is well aware that he's part of a
long line of actors who have played the legendary outlaw Billy the
Kid.
   ``I think even James Cagney played him,'' said Kilmer.
   Actually, Cagney is one of the few who never played Billy the
Kid. Cagney was in ``The Oklahoma Kid,'' ``The Frisco Kid'' and
``The St. Louis Kid,'' but he never played Billy the Kid.
   Kilmer, best-known for his roles as Madmartigan in the George
Lucas myth-fantasy ``Willow'' and as the hotshot pilot Iceman in
the Tom Cruise hit ``Top Gun,'' turns in an intriguing performance
as William H. Bonney in the new Turner Network Telvision cable
movie ``Gore Vidal's Billy the Kid,'' premiering Wednesday.
   This latest retelling of the events of the Lincoln County war in
the New Mexico Territory and Billy's slaying at the age of 21 by
Sheriff Pat Garrett in 1881 is Vidal's attempt to make good on the
skewed vision of Bonney contained in the 1958 film ``The Left
Handed Gun.'' Based on a teleplay by Vidal, it starred Paul Newman.
   Others who have played Billy the Kid include Johnny Mack Brown,
Roy Rogers, Robert Taylor, Audie Murphy, Bob Steele, Buster Crabbe,
Kris Kristofferson, and Jack Buetel in ``The Outlaw,'' which
shocked in 1943 because of Jane Russell's cleavage. Most recently,
Bonney was played by Emilio Estevez in ``Young Guns.''
   ``Most writers find their finds in other mythical renditions of
the subject,'' said Kilmer. ``Gore is quite passionate about this.
He got squeezed out as producer of `The Left Handed Gun.' Actually,
Billy used both hands.
   ``I have a special interest, too, because my grandfather came
from Tennessee to mine gold in New Mexico when Lincoln County was
still wild. Once five men rode up to their mine, and my
grandfather's friends opened fire and killed them all.''
   If the new film doesn't beatify Billy, it does portray him as
immensely sympathetic. His story has been open to many
interpretations. Bonney's legend began when he was still alive and
was idolized as the epitome of the Western hero. Others considered
him a common cattle thief and psychopathic killer.
   Canadian Duncan Regehr plays Pat Garrett. The movie also stars
Wilford Brimley as New Mexico's territorial governor, Lew Wallace,
Ned Vaughn and Patrick Massett as Billy's young gang members, Julie
Carmen as his love interest and Michael Parks as a corrupt
prosecutor. Rene Auberjonois (``Benson'') has an offbeat role as a
poet-drunkard who shows up occasionally to comment on the tragedy
of Billy's life.
   ``What Billy represented and the reason for Gore's passion for
the character is that he had a force and a spirit that articulated
very dramatically that part of our history,'' said Kilmer. ``The
view of Billy as a psychopath is a prejudicial account based on Pat
Garrett's book.
   ``Billy was intelligent. He read history. His myth was very
powerful during his own life. You'd have to look at today's rock
stars for a comparison to the idolization he enjoyed. Pat Garrett
represented progress. Billy didn't want things to change, but he
did stand for something. He only became an outlaw, because they
tricked him into believing he would get amnesty (for the revenge
killing of a sheriff) from Gov. Wallace. Billy had a legitimate
cause.''
   Kilmer said he ``prayed real hard'' for the role, having been
disappointed when he missed out on the part in ``Young Guns.''
   ``Billy represents one man fighting alone. He was passionately
loyal to his friends and unrelenting against his enemies,'' he said.
   Kilmer is currently filming ``Kill Me Again'' in Nevada with his
wife, Joanne Whalley-Kilmer, who plays Christine Keeler in
``Scandal.''
   Like his cousin, the late Joyce Kilmer, famous for the poem
``Trees,'' Kilmer also writes poetry.
   ``I had a book of poetry published last year,'' he said. ``I
have a lap-top computer and I was compiling it and writing it in my
trailer during `Willow.' I'd write while I was in my muddy armor.''

<TEXT>
   First-time homebuyers often are appalled by the
number of fees and charges, such as for credit checks, appraisals
and pest inspections, that must be paid at the closing.
   Watch out, say some mortgage bankers, lest your real estate
agent slip in still another, a referral fee, or a charge for having
steered you to the lender who agrees to finance the purchase.
   That issue has set off a conflict in an industry where builders,
sellers and lenders often see eye to eye, often taking the same
stand on legislative and other matters in which they have a mutual
interest.
   They don't agree on referral fees, or the practice of sales
agents using their influence with lenders to obtain mortgages and
then charging homebuyers a fee for the service.
   ``You should be aware of them,'' says Willard Gourley, Jr.,
president of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America. ``They
are fees you don't need to pay for services you don't need to
have.''
   That isn't quite the way the National Association of Realtors
sees things.
   ``We are opposed to naked referrals,'' says Lois Clinton,
explaining that such a referral is one in which the Realtor does
little more than supply a name. But when the Realtor does something
more, she said, a fee is justified.
   ``We believe our position is forthright and honest. It's not
something unethical, as the mortgage bankers seem to imply,'' she
said. With changing technology, she explained, agents are more
involved in the mortgage origination process.
   Increasingly, real estate agents offer a computerized service in
which the homebuyer, without leaving the real estate office, may
obtain a review of the loan offerings and interest rates of
mortgage providers active in the area.
   Is that a ``naked referral?'' It's hard to say. To simply
provide the name of a bank active in mortgage lending is naked. But
any activity beyond that is a cloudy area, one that appears to
involve a matter of judgment.
   Says Gourley: ``Lenders have special deals with certain real
estate agents _meaning the real estate agent has a special interest
in not only completing the home sale, but in where the borrower
gets a loan.''
   As he sees it, and has so stated in material prepared for the
media and distributed as a pamphlet, ``real estate agents can make
extra income by using certain lenders, even though that lender's
mortgage rates may be higher.''
   It's not just the free market at work, he says. Homebuyers may
pay an additional fee to the real estate agent of up to $1,000 on a
$100,000 mortgage ``for no service, just for `referring' the
borrower to a lender.''
   There's more to it than that, says Gourley. Not only does the
borrower pay a fee, but there's a chance the borrower might also
pay a half percentage point over market because the lender must
recover money paid to the agent.
   He calls some referral programs ``blatant and illegal kickbacks
to real estate agents,'' and he fears that in a competitive
marketplace they will flourish, with one agency or lender copying
the other.
   According to Gourley, who also is vice chairman of Barclays
American Mortgage Corp., Charlotte, N.C., one lender's printed
promotional flyer offers real estate agents as much as $120,000 a
year for referrals. Other programs, he says, offer luxury trips to
exotic sites.
   He calls for the Department of Housing and Urban Development or
Congress to act quickly to end referral practices. Otherwise, he
says, ``the integrity of the mortgage market will be damaged.''

   Japanese companies are using third countries as
channels to reduce direct imports from South Africa and avert
criticism that Japan's trade supports the apartheid system, trade
experts and anti-apartheid activists say.
   ``Japanese imports from South Africa fell only because it
(Japan) imported South African gold and platinum indirectly through
third countries such as Switzerland, Britain and France,'' said
Jerry Matsila, a Tokyo representative of the African National
Congress, a group seeking to overthrow the Pretoria government.
   Foreign Ministry officials have emphasized the government
opposes the apartheid system of racial segregation but said there
was no legal way to prevent companies from using third countries as
conduits for South African products.
   In 1987, Japan was Pretoria's No. 1 trading partner, surpassing
the United States and West Germany. As a result the Japanese came
under heavy criticism for giving economic support to apartheid.
   In June last year, Japan was singled out in a United Nations
resolution criticizing its increased trade with South Africa.
   The government in early 1988 asked trading companies to practice
self-restraint in trade with South Africa, and then was pleased
when trade figures announced in January showed Japan was no longer
South Africa's biggest trading partner, having fallen behind West
Germany.
   Japan's two-way trade with South Africa in 1988 declined 3.5
percent from 1987 to $3.98 billion.
   But detailed official statistics show the drop in overall trade
was largely due to a drastic decline in imports of precious metals
from South Africa.
   Although exports to South Africa grew 9.8 percent in 1988 from
the previous year, imports from South Africa fell 14.5 percent, due
to a 40.7 percent decline in the dollar value of platinum imports
and an 84.3 percent drop in the dollar value of gold imports.
   Critics and scholars closely following the controversy say that
Japan only shifted its source of platinum and gold from South
Africa to third countries, many of which import these precious
metals from South Africa.
   Customs clearance statistics show Japan's imports of gold and
platinum from Britain, Switzerland, France, West Germany and the
United States jumped dramatically.
   By weight, gold imports from Britain in 1988 jumped 80.9 percent
from the previous year while gold from Switzerland increased by
19.8 percent.
   Platinum imports from Britain more than doubled, those from West
Germany were up more than 700 percent, and those from France were
27 times higher than the previous year.
   ``It is common knowledge that neither Britain nor Switzerland
produces gold or platinum,'' said Yoko Kitazawa, an author who has
also researched Japanese uranium purchases from southern Africa.
``It is obvious that Japan is changing labels of South African gold
and platinum to those of Britain and Switzerland when those
precious metals go to exchanges in Zurich and London, and
registering them as British and Swiss gold and platinum.''
   Foreign Ministry officials said Japanese companies may have used
third countries to produce lower figures for imports from South
Africa.
   But ``you can't really prove'' how much of the imports from
third countries are South African products, said Yasufumi Kotake,
who works on one of the ministry's Africa desks.
   ``I am not sure if we can single out Japanese companies and
blame them for switching the sources of imports,'' he said.
``Legally, there is not really any way to prevent Japanese
companies from importing South African products from third
countries.''
   Kotake stressed that ``Japan is doing what she can do. And we
need cooperation from other European countries and the United
States to make it a concerted effort.''
   But Matsila, the African National Congress representative,
charged that ``what Japan is doing is hiding the origin of its
imports. What it eventually got out of South Africa in 1988 was
considerably more than that of 1987 if you include those indirectly
imported products.''
   Government statistics show Japan's two-way trade with South
Africa in 1988, excluding gold and platinum, actually increased 8.1
percent from the previous year.
   Most Japanese firms involved in gold and platinum trading
declined to comment. But one official of Tanaka Precious Metal Co.,
Japan's largest platinum supplier, said, ``We have been only using
non-South African platinum such as from the Soviet Union for years.
We are not prepared to discuss the matter right now.''
   An expert on the precious metals market, requesting anonymity,
said: ``Japan has grown into the world's largest platinum market
because of its growing demand for jewelry and as a means of
investment, as well as for industrial use. Only South African
platinum can fulfill Japan's large demands.''
   Statistics show Japan imported about 70 percent of the world's
total platinum output in 1988, while South Africa produced about 80
percent of the total output. The Soviet Union and Canada produce
the remaining 20 percent.

immortalized peaceful Montmartre street scenes, was plagued by
counterfeiters _ first in life and now in death, his widow's sole
heir says.
   Jean Fabris, 58, is waging war against the alleged fakes,
accusing art dealers, auctioneers and experts of putting profit
before art. Critics of his efforts claim he's the one who is after
money.
   He disrupted auction sales in April at both Christies and
Sotheby's in London, crying ``Fake, fake.'' He was removed from the
auction houses, and the sales of the 17 contested Utrillos went
ahead. His campaign scored a tentative victory in Paris when he
persuaded a criminal court judge to confiscate seven alleged
Utrillo paintings valued at more than $1 million from well-known
Paris auctioneer Guy Loudmer.
   Verification of the disputed paintings will be handled by a
court-appointed panel of experts. A final decision is not expected
until early summer.
   Fabris has also challenged the New York market. He has written
to Sotheby's and Christie's threatening court action if they do not
withdraw nine Utrillos to be sold by Sotheby's on May 10 and six
more by Christie's on May 11.
   ``We're not surprised to learn that he is once again attempting
to promote unfounded allegations in the press,'' said Diana Levitt,
a vice president and director of corporate affairs for Sotheby's in
New York.
   ``As we previously stated, and as the courts in France have also
found, Mr. Fabris is not a recognized expert in Utrillo's works. We
have notified him that we stand by our authentication of the works
in our sale and that we intend to offer them for sale on the date
scheduled and that if he interferes in our sale, we will take
whatever action we think approbriate to protect Sotheby's and our
consignors' rights.''
   The seven Utrillos in the April 4 London sale fetched over 1
million pounds ($1.68 million).
   Utrillo's naive street scenes, with their fine sense of
atmosphere and composition, have become synonymous with Paris, and
especially with artists' haunts in Montmartre such as the famed old
music hall ``Le Lapin Agile.''
   Utrillo, who died in 1955 at the age of 72, was known to have
been copied widely during his lifetime. Locked into an unusually
tight agreement to sell his work solely through his dealer, he
reportedly sold paintings on the sly to support his increasingly
debilitating alcohol habit.
   ``Later, when the paintings would surface, he would simply say
they were fakes,'' Loudmer said in an interview. ``That was his way
of getting extra money.''
   Fabris, who was called a ``longtime devoted friend'' by
Utrillo's wife, Lucie Valore, when she amended her will to leave
everything to him, claims that in addition to the 3,500-4,000
original Utrillo paintings in museums and private collections, at
least 3,500 fakes are circulating worldwide.
   ``Technically, it would have been impossible for Utrillo to
paint more than the paintings which have been cataloged,'' he said
in an interview.
   Fabris said some of the contested paintings were probably the
work of Valore, also an artist but less gifted than her husband.
   ``Utrillo didn't paint much during the last 10 years of his
life,'' he said. ``She would paint, he would sign and that way,
madame could have her jewels, her hairdresser and they could keep
up their high living.''
   The disputed works in the Paris court case are ``Montmartre,''
``La Chaumiere d'Henri IV a Montmartre,'' ``Rue Saint-Rustique et
le Sacre Coeur,'' ``La Rue Cortot a Montmartre,'' ``Le Moulin de la
Galette'' and two works entitled ``Le Lapin Agile.''
   Fabris says he determined they were fakes after studying
enlargements of details from reproductions printed in the sales
catalog.
   ``The signatures are not normal. The letters are hesitating and
overdone, sure signs that they're fakes, when you know that Utrillo
signed his name automatically, in a single gesture,'' he said.
   ``Montmartre never looked like the painting entitled `La Rue
Cortot.' It may be a street in Saint-Tropez, but it's not the
Montmartre that Utrillo loved to paint.''
   Fabris said he can only guess why Utrillo was copied so much
more extensively than his contemporaries _ Georges Seurat, Maurice
de Vlaminck, Georges Braque and Marc Chagall _ who also lived and
worked in Montmartre in the early 1900s.
   ``That's part of the Utrillo mystery. He painted authentic
street scenes that captured local people in their daily life. They
became stereotypes symbolizing Paris and Montmartre, especially for
foreigners,'' he said. ``It was a curse in life, and now a curse in
death.''
   Loudmer and other auctioneers claim Fabris has hurt the future
sale of Utrillos in France, where the market already is struggling
to compete with other European capitals where sales taxes are lower
and regulations on export licenses less restrictive.
   ``People will take their Utrillos elsewhere,'' Loudmer said,
adding that British auction houses sell $200 million to $300
million in French paintings each year.
   Guillaume Duhamel, a spokesman for Christie's in Paris, said two
Utrillos were withdrawn from a May 3 sale in Monaco at the request
of the owners. Christie's, however, stood by its judgment that they
were authentic.
   Loudmer and other art world insiders accuse Fabris of trying to
replace the existing catalog documenting the painter's complete
works. Paul Petrides, Utrillo's dealer and long considered among
the world's most reliable experts, compiled it.
   ``Fabris wants the last word. He wants authentication to go
through him _ and for a price,'' Loudmer said. ``Mr. Fabris is
simply trying to `get a piece of the Utrillo cake,' which is quite
extensive.
   ``I have no doubt whatsover on the attribution of these seven
paintings, all of which have been examined closely by numerous
experts.''
   But Fabris, who says he has spent 15 years sifting through some
50,000 catalogs tracking down original Utrillo works, says he is
sure the works are fakes.
   ``The police laboratory analyses will vindicate me, and this
will turn out to be the biggest art scandal of the century,'' he
said. ``French experts are a joke. Experts, dealers, auctioneers
are all in it together. The Paris art market needs to be purged.''

   Move over, Grover. It's a squirt, Ernie and
Bert. Hear the word, Big Bird?
   ``Sesame Street'' is having a baby. After 20 years of
entertaining preschoolers, the public television show is creating
one of its own. The peewee set is all a-quiver; no television birth
has been more eagerly awaited since Ricky Jr. was born to Lucy and
Ricky Ricardo in 1953.
   Two of the show's characters, Luis and Maria, married at the end
of last season; on Friday, in this season's finale, their baby will
be born and introduced to the neighbors and the world.
   Details of the blessed event are closely guarded. Those who know
the child's sex are sworn to secrecy _ wild cookie monsters could
not drag the information from this reporter _ and even the
circumstances of the couple's trip to the hospital are not being
divulged.
   ``Everybody's at their wit's end, and they can't get there. ...
Oscar (the Grouch) goes through some changes,'' said Sonia Manzano,
who plays Maria.
   Young viewers will not see the actual delivery. ``Obviously, you
can't show something like this. It's too scary,'' Ms. Manzano said.
   Few subjects are too scary for ``Sesame Street.'' One of the
show's original cast members, Will Lee, died in 1983. Rather than
allowing Lee's character, kindly Mr. Hooper, to retire in Florida,
the show's writers chose to have him die and use his demise as a
way of discussing death.
   But ``in the early years of the show, we were advised that we
should not have a child'' born on ``Sesame Street,'' said producer
Dulcy Singer. The concept was too complicated and would interfere
with the mission of teaching the alphabet and numbers, the show's
advisers said.
   In its 18th year, the show broached the subject when characters
Gordon and Susan adopted a child, Miles. Then, when Ms. Manzano
married in real life, she discussed with Ms. Singer the possibility
of her becoming pregnant while appearing on the show.
   Ms. Monzano did have a baby 13 months ago. Her pregnancy
inspired the ``Sesame Street'' storyline; she wrote many of the
episodes involving pregnancy and childbirth, using her experience
as a guide.
   She was aided by the legendary ``Sesame Street'' research team,
which surveyed 60 pre-schoolers to find out what they knew about
pregnancy.
   The answer, said research director Valeria Lovelace, was not
much.
   To start, they did not understand the word ``pregnancy,'' and,
explained Lovelace, ``We wanted to define pregnancy as when a woman
has a baby growing in her body.''
   But where? The children did not understand the word ``womb''; it
sounded like ``room.'' And ``tummy'' was inaccurate. In the end,
Maria described the baby's location as ``a special place,'' and she
pointed to it.
   Unsurprisingly, the children did not know how women became
pregnant. Ultimately, Luis explained that when he and Maria got
married, they decided to have a family and start a baby growing in
Maria's body.
   ``We don't get into sex education. That's something we leave to
the parents,'' said Ms. Singer.
   Most preschoolers knew that only women have children, and that
pregnant women should eat ``good food'' to nourish their baby. Most
didn't mention milk, so a point was made of having Maria drink milk
often.
   Most knew that the baby moved inside its mother, although one
3-year-old asserted that the fetus dances.
   But most didn't realize that women went to the doctor regularly
throughout their pregnancies. This gave ``Sesame Street'' an
opportunity to plug prenatal care throughout Maria's pregnancy.
   ``If nothing else, we get little nags into the home,'' Ms.
Lovelace said.
   In one episode, Big Bird accompanied Maria to the obstetrician.
The expectant mothers and their doctor seemed unfazed by the
presence of an eight-foot-tall yellow fowl in the office.
   ``Who is this _ a friend or a relative?'' the doctor asked.
   When Maria complains she is tired, Big Bird says he, too, tires
sometimes and asks if that means he is pregnant. Only ladies get
pregnant, he is told. ``I knew that,'' he replies. When the doctor
amplifies the fetal heartbeat, Big Bird is exultant.
   ``Big Bird sort of represents our audience,'' said Ms. Singer.
When a test group of toddlers screened the heartbeat episode, they
watched in awe.
   Ms. Manzano, who has been on the show 17 years, looks forward to
next year. In addition to forays into geography and ecology,
``Sesame Street'' will use Maria's baby to discuss the care and
feeding of an infant.
   At first, a newborn will play the role. But eventually, Maria's
baby will be played by Ms. Manzano's baby, thus solving Ms.
Manzano's childcare worries.
   ``It's a wonderful situation to be in, but I never thought my
own child would upstage me,'' Ms. Manzano said with a laugh.

<TEXT>
   The hopeful, the desperate, the
adventurers have come in hordes, swamping this tiny community on
the shores of Prince William Sound.
   Weary-looking women and men with work-scarred hands loiter near
job agencies, waiting for the miracle _ a $16.67-an-hour,
back-breaking job sopping up the nation's worst oil spill.
   In a few weeks they have doubled the population of this town _
and still they come.
   ``It's not often you can go out and make good money,'' says
Patty West, a homesteader from near Tok. She has been living in an
old van covered by a plastic tarp to keep out the rain. ``There are
just so many people, you have to wait your turn.''
   City officials and others wonder how long the city can handle
the crush.
   Before the Exxon Valdez rammed Bligh Reef on March 24 and dumped
almost 11 million gallons of crude oil into the sound, Valdez
counted about 3,500 residents. Now, the number is about 7,000 and
climbing daily.
   The impact is severe.
   Businesses cannot find or keep help as workers seek
better-paying Exxon jobs. Hotels are jammed, additional housing in
non-existent and parks are being cleared of snow to open early for
camping.
   Garbage collections have doubled. Water consumption has
increased by 1 million gallons a day as scores of cleanup vessels
tap the city supply. ``It's going to get worse,'' says Public Works
Director Lee Schlitz.
   Burger King has wheeled in a portable fast-food restaurant,
complete with roped off drive-in lane. City licensing officials say
it may not be the last such portable unit.
   The Copper Valley Telephone Cooperative has added 108
long-distance lines to keep up. ``It's been tough,'' says Dean
Moore, the utility's general manager. ``We've had to meet growth in
the last 30 days that wasn't even anticipated over five years.''
   Arrests last month jumped by 500 percent over April 1988, and
police are working overtime, says Joe Michaud, the city's chief of
emergency services.
   ``We're running them ragged. We had $25,000 (budgeted) for
overtime for the year. We used that up the first week,'' he says.
``Our bar fights, domestic disturbances, street fights, they're way
up.'' Arrests for drunken driving haved quadrupled over the same
period last year.
   Ambulance calls have increased 100 percent, Michaud says.
   The statistics, instead of improving, are getting a little worse
each week, he adds. ``That has us worried.''
   Prostitution seems unable to get a foothold, although two new
prostitutes arrived after the spill to set up shop, Michaud says.
``Most of the people coming here are not working and don't have
much money. Business apparently was not that good and they left on
their own.''
   The impact also has been felt at Valdez Community Hospital,
where emergency room activity has increased at least 100 percent,
says administrator Joy Keating.
   She says she has lost her two lab technicians because of the
spill and cannot find replacements. One quit to work with oiled
otters; the other was dissatisfied with post-spill Valdez, she says.
   ``A lot of people just don't like this town anymore,'' Keating
says.
   At the city's bustling waterfront, harbor officials can barely
keep up.
   ``General confusion is the best way to put it,'' says
Harbormaster Tim Lopez. The spill has increased harbor use by
cleanup vessels, support boats and floatplanes, he says.
   ``It's going to get a lot worse than this,'' Lopez says. ``The
recreational fleet hasn't even put into the water yet. And the
commercial fleet will be coming.''
   Mayor John Devens says Valdez has started to feel the effect on
its $32 million annual budget, but he says there are other problems.
   ``I think people are getting uncomfortable,'' he says. ``The
quality of life is certainly not as good as in normal times.''
   The city gets most of its income from taxes on oil industry
facilities. Devens says Valdez has been struggling for the last few
years to face the fact that North Slope oil is not inexhaustible.
   Officials and business leaders have put money and effort into
diversifying the city's economy, and the spill may damage that
effort, he says.
   ``We're not sure what the effect will be. This is not good for
tourism, not good for fishing, not good for our port. We have not
gotten much sympathy from Exxon.''
   Devens says the city's relationship with oil companies may cool
because of the spill.
   ``They've never given scholarships, never built any city parks.
They really haven't done much except provide a tax base. They've
done that not because of generosity, but because it's the law.
   ``The slate is getting kind of balanced.''

   New York City without Ed Koch?
   For some _ especially Koch, the opinionated mayor of the past 11
years _ it's hard to picture. For others, including at least six
who want the job, it's easy. And polls and pundits seem to agree:
Mayor Edward I. Koch is in trouble.
   After four years of scandals, homelessness, AIDS, crack, crime
and crumbling bridges, many New Yorkers think their No. 1 loudmouth
has gone from lovable to laughable to lose-able.
   Koch, 64, acknowledges he's not the same man who went from
Congress to Gracie Mansion, the mayor's residence, in 1977: ``I'm
not any smarter _ I'm wiser, I hope. I'm more beaten up. I'm just
as resilient in terms of coming off the mat and fighting back.''
   For much of the country, Koch is the book-writing, Donald
Trump-taunting, Jesse Jackson-jeering embodiment of the essential
New Yorker _ obstinate, obnoxious, smart and sort of entertaining.
Talks too much.
   At home, polls show his Democratic voter support straining to
reach 30 percent; half of the voters disapprove of his performance.
He'd lose a four-way race for the Democratic nomination, the polls
say, and even if he won, he would be defeated by a Republican,
former U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani.
   But those are just scientific newspaper polls. Koch said his own
show-of-hands polls at his public appearances indicate otherwise.
``I think there is a reservoir of great goodwill out there and
appreciation for what I've done.''
   Others might disagree. Koch is ``on the ropes'' (Wall Street
Journal) and his third term ``a shambles'' (Vanity Fair), partly
because of his ``mean-spirited, gratuitous, bullying
egocentricity'' (New York magazine).
   And those were relatively even-handed articles.
   In the bookstores is ``City for Sale,'' 466 pages dense with
details of the corruption scandals that tainted everyone from
borough presidents to the Gracie Mansion chef, who used city
equipment for his catering business.
   Newspapers offer daily doses of criticism _ Koch says he's ``the
whipping post for about six or eight columnists.'' And a black
newspaper, the Amsterdam News, has called for his resignation on
its front page for more than 160 weeks.
   Koch, however, is planning to become the city's first four-term
mayor. The primary election is Sept. 12.
   ``Now, I don't expect to get the 78 percent majority I got in
1985. That was unique _ the highest in the history of the city. But
all I need is 51. And I hope to get even better than that,'' Koch
said.
   His main challenger for the Democratic nomination is Manhattan
Borough President David Dinkins, who leads the polls and would be
the first black mayor. Two other Democrats expected to run are city
Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin and Richard Ravitch, a builder who
has headed the state Urban Development Corp. and the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority.
   Waiting to take on the survivor is Giuliani, who earned a
crime-busting aura by prosecuting mobsters, Wall Streeters and
corrupt officials. Giuliani is faced by Ronald Lauder, an heir to
the Estee Lauder cosmetics fortune who was ambassador to Austria
during the Reagan administration.
   ``I'm the underdog, and I'm not saying that to get sympathy. All
the polls show it,'' Koch said. What they really show, he feels, is
vague dissatisfaction and annoyance with the guy who's been on the
television for 12 years.
   ``My friends and supporters have said, `Listen, one of the
things that people say they don't like _ in the sense that they
once did _ is your feistiness. So tune it down,''' he said. ``I'm
trying. You'll notice my voice is two octaves lower. I'm
practicing. And I speak slow.''
   ``The problem for Koch,'' said former Senate candidate Mark
Green, ``is that many of his opponents embody a compelling
rationale against him.
   ``Dinkins can credibly argue that he is a quiet healer, not a
nasty loudmouth dividing our city. Giuliani can credibly argue that
he is a fresh face who will clean up the city, unlike the mayor who
looked the other way.
   ``Goldin is a Koch without the sleaze or the shtick. He's smart,
experienced and nervy. Ravitch can persuasively argue that he's an
experienced builder who can run without the baggage of being a
clubhouse politician.''
   None has to defend an administration in which six officials
appointed by the mayor have gone to jail or been indicted and 200
low-level officials have been charged with wrongdoing.
   ``I accept full responsibility for everything, good and bad, in
my administration,'' Koch said. ``And I say to people: When you
judge me, judge me on what you would have done before and what you
would have done after. And did I do what makes common sense?''
   Koch speaks with pride of his administration's accomplishments:
hundreds of millions spent on the homeless, a $5.1 billion program
to create 53,000 new and rehabilitated apartments by 1993, millions
being spent on Tactical Narcotics Teams of police officers who
focus on drug-ridden neighborhoods.
   ``No city does what we do. We get no credit for it. There is a
gap between substance and what people perceive,'' he said,
admitting however that the perception is distorted by his combative
nature and sarcasm.
   ``It may be that people have come to the conclusion that people
don't want that sense of humor and other personality aspects,''
Koch said.
   ```Time for a change' is the No. 1 cardinal slogan when you have
someone who's been there for two terms. I've been there for three
terms. That doesn't mean I shouldn't be there for a fourth term.''

   Federal agents pulled traders off the floors of
at least two New York commodity exchanges, issued subpoenas and
seized documents as part of a criminal and civil investigation of
the chaotic markets.
   Authorities said the government subpoenaed more than 50 traders
from four of New York's five commodities exchanges, seeking
information about trading practices by firms and individuals.
   No arrests were made Thursday or arrest warrants issued.

   The nation's major retailers said sales picked up moderately in
April, but not enough to imply consumers have forgotten about
credit costs and inflation creeping up.
   Store executives and industry analysts said Thursday that better
weather in parts of the country in late April helped stir shoppers'
interest in seasonal clothing and merchandise, partially
compensating for a weak first half.
   One big general merchandise retailer that reported a negative
impact on business from early April's unfavorable weather was K
mart Corp., the second largest chain store in the country.

   Avon Products Inc.'s chairman reiterated at the
company's annual shareholders meeting that the cosmetics giant
intends to remain independent and focus on its core beauty and
direct selling businesses.
   The assertion Thursday came a day after Minneapolis investor
Irwin Jacobs and rival Amway Corp. disclosed they had amassed a
10.3 percent stake in Avon and might seek to acquire the company.
   But talk at the Avon meeting was dominated by animal rights
issues, not takeovers, as shareholders rejected a proposal to force
the company to disclose details of animal testing used for its

   The typical American household, nearly six
members strong when the nation was new, is down statistically to
just over 2{ people, a record low, the Census Bureau said.
   The decline reflects ``changes in the age structure of the
American population,'' said Census Bureau demographer Campbell

   The House and Senate, upholding a
much-criticized agreement with President Bush, moved toward
approval of $1.2 trillion budget measures which promise to reduce
the deficit without cutting spending or significantly raising taxes.
   Each chamber rejected several attempts Thursday to overhaul the
blueprint for tax and spending policy in fiscal 1990 as they
approached final votes.
   As laid out by the White House agreement, the budgets claim to
shrink the federal deficit to just below $100 billion, as required
by the Gramm-Rudman law. They would allow federal programs to grow
but, especially at the Pentagon, at less than the rate of inflation.

<TEXT>
   Major American retailers are benefiting from a turnaround in
women's apparel sales, which helped produce a modest boost in
business at several chain stores during April.
   Department stores and specialty apparel merchants generally had
good news to report in results issued Thursday. Women's clothing
sales continued to rebound from last year's low levels and analysts
cited keen interest in career wardrobes as one cause.
   Among the apparel-oriented merchants that posted decent sales
were: Dayton Hudson Corp., a Minneapolis-based department-store
operator; May Department Stores Co., a St. Louis-based owner of
department stores and discount home and shoe shops; J.C. Penney Co.
Inc., the Dallas-based nationwide chain; and, Limited Inc., which
has specialty apparel shops and is based in Columbus, Ohio.
   One big general merchandise retailer reported a negative impact
on business from early April's colder-than-normal weather in many
parts of the country, particularly the Midwest and Northest.
   But the retailer, Troy, Mich.-based K mart Corp., the second
largest chain store in the country, said sales of things such as
spring and summer clothing, do-it-yourself gadgetry, patio
furniture, barbecue grills and other outdoor gear improved as the
weather warmed up during the second half of April.
   Meanwhile, the largest U.S. retailer, Sears, Roebuck and Co.,
was pleased with its take. Sears, which is banking on a new
low-pricing policy to boost customer traffic, also benefited from
the rollout of its Brand Central superstores.
   Helped by the marketing of more national brands alongside its
flagship Kenmore label, Sears' sales of home electronics and
appliances rose by double-digit percentages in April.
   Jeffrey Edelman, a retail industry analyst at Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc., said the April numbers looked good overall partly
because they were being compared with last year's depressed
tallies. Still, he said, April represented a significant
improvement from March's very sluggish volumes.
   ``This in an indication that the consumer is not dead, spending
is just slowing down,'' Edelman said.
   Expenditures on things that are typically financed with bank
loans have been curbed a bit by increases in interest rates this
year.
   Jeffrey Feiner, an analyst with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., said sales
industry-wide this year have barely outpaced the inflation rate,
indicating that consumer spending, a key element in economic
growth, is easing.
   Feiner has scaled down his forecast for average 1989 retail
sales growth to 5.5 percent from 6 percent, based on sales results
so far this year.
   Thomas Tashjian, an analyst with Seidler Amdec Securities Inc.
in Los Angeles, said one of the positive factors in this year's
retail equation is that big chains have refrained from slashing
prices to clear out slow-moving goods. This, combined with tight
inventory management, will help preserve profitability in the
retail business.
   The results Thursday were from some of the biggest general
merchandise chains in the United States, including purveyors of
special apparel lines and accessories. Monthly retail sales figures
from the government are more comprehensive and include the take at
other types of establishments such as auto dealerships,
supermarkets and restaurants.
   Here are some of the figures:
   Chicago-based Sears said its sales rose 9.2 percent in the four
weeks ended April 29 from the comparable 1988 period and sales at
stores open at least a year, called same or comparable store sales,
rose 6.8 percent.
   Retailers and industry analysts consider same-store sales a more
accurate indication of a company's performance than totals that
include sales at newly opened stores. Not every retailer reports
same-store sales.
   K mart said its sales in the four weeks to April 26 were up 2.3
percent but, on a same-store basis, sales fell 1 percent.
   The third-largest retailer, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., said its April
sales rose 25 percent while its same-store sales gained 11 percent.
The fast-growing discounter, based in Bentonville, Ark., routinely
reports double-digit same-store sales growth.

<TEXT>
   Exxon Corp. President Lee R. Raymond says too
much bureaucracy could hinder the mop-up of the nation's worst oil
spill and denied the company was trying to cut corners in the
cleanup.
   At a news conference Thursday in his New York office, Raymond
said that as many as 14 government agencies may be involved in
approving and carrying out Exxon's final cleanup plan.
   ``I want some one person in charge _ I don't care who it is _
because there has to be one person that finally says `hey, it's
midnight and we gotta do something. And here's what we're going to
do.''
   Raymond said Exxon was continuing to operate under a plan
approved April 17 by the U.S. Coast Guard until a revised plan is
given the go-ahead. Exxon submitted the latest proposal to the
Coast Guard on Monday after portions of the current plan were
criticized as inadequate.
   The oil tanker Exxon Valdez crashed into a reef March 24,
spilling more than 11 million gallons of crude oil into Price
William Sound. Exxon accepted responsibility for the spill but has
been criticized for dragging its feet in its initial response to
the disaster.
   Raymond defended the latest proposal, _ which he said was
formulated with the help of state and federal environmental
officials _ despite ongoing criticism by some state regulators. The
proposal calls for cleaning up 364 miles of shoreline by Sept. 15.
   He also rejected reports alleging that Exxon was attempting to
bypass environmental regulations to dispose of waste accumulated
from the spill.
   The first page of Exxon's new waste disposal plan calls for use
of existing treatment and disposal facilities at the Alyeska Valdez
Terminal. ``Use of the Alyeska facilities will also require
cooperation from the regulatory agencies to rapidly issue letters
of non-objection, waivers, or permit modifications as required,''
the plan says.
   Raymond said, however, that the wording was misinterpreted and
that ``everything can be accomplished within environmental laws.''
   Raymond also said Exxon would do ``anything reasonable'' to
cleanse Alaska's soiled waters and beaches and that it placed the
cleanup of 191 miles of lightly oil beaches last on the list of
priorities after consultations with environmental officials. He
said Exxon would clean even those areas, except in cases,
particularly wildlife habitats, judged better left untouched.
   ``Anything that makes sense that they would say you ought to do
in addition to what you have in the plan, we'll do it,'' Raymond
said.

   Interest rates on 52-week Treasury bills fell
in Thursday's action to the lowest level in six months.
   The Treasury Department sold $9 billion of the bills at an
average discount rate of 8.44 percent, down from 8.75 percent at
the last auction on April 6.
   The rates were the lowest since Nov. 17, when the one-year bills
sold for 8.44 percent. The new discount rate understates the actual
return to investors _ 9.15 percent with a $10,000 bill selling for
$9,146.60.

<HEAD>With PM-Commodities Probe, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Commodities exchanges give speculators the opportunity to bet
millions of dollars on the future prices of goods ranging from gold
to Treasury bills to frozen orange juice.
   The purpose of the futures exchanges is to transfer the risk of
price fluctuations from people who don't want the risk, such as
farmers or metals processors, to speculators who are willing to
gamble on making big profits.
   Futures contracts are agreements to deliver a quantity of goods
at a specified price at a certain time in the future. Options,
which also are widely traded on the exchanges, give purchasers the
right but not the obligation to buy or sell something at a certain
price within a specified period.
   Commodities traders, standing in recessed ``pits'' and dressed
in brightly colored jackets, shout orders and wave hand signals to
each other in a free- for-all auction of contracts.
   In a typical transaction on a commodities exchange, a farmer who
wants to lock in a guaranteed price to minimize risk will promise
to deliver 20,000 pounds of live beef cattle at a specified future
date at a specified price.
   Assuming the price rises, the speculator who buys the contract
could later take the cattle from the farmer and resell them to
someone else at the higher prevailing market price, pocketing the
profit.
   But if the price goes down, the speculator would lose money by
having to pay the farmer the agreed-upon price and then resell the
cattle at the lower market price.
   In practice, speculators rarely end up with mountains of tin or
pork bellies _ they sell their positions at a profit or loss before
the delivery date. The ultimate buyer is a customer who actually
needs the commodity.
   Although the exchanges began with agricultural products, they
have rapidly expanded into financial products. For example, the
Chicago Board of Trade does most of its business in contracts based
on the value of the Standard &amp; Poor's 100-stock and 500-stock
indexes.
   Other major exchanges include the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
the New York Mercantile Exchange, the Commodity Exchange in New
York, the New York Cotton Exchange, the Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa
Exchange.

<HEAD>Oil Drillers Union Seeks Moratorium on Arctic Refuge Drilling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARJORIE ANDERS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The union that represents oil workers nationwide
has announced its opposition to drilling in the coastal plains of
Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
   The Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Union says a moratorium on
drilling in the environmentally sensitive refuge is not
antithetical to its members' need to work.
   ``I'm for drilling, but there has to be some sanity to the
process, and there doesn't seem to be any,'' OCAW Vice President
Robert Wages said in a recent interview.
   ``Saying you shouldn't drill in the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge ought not be viewed as religious heresy by the industry,''
Wages said.
   He said union leaders are on the stump to rally support for a
cohesive national energy policy.
   Previously, the union was neutral on coastal drilling, although
the membership had passed several resolutions asking its leadership
to be sensitive to both jobs and the environment.
   But when the Exxon Valdez ran aground March 24 and spilled
250,000 gallons of crude oil into Alaska's Prince Edward Sound,
union opposition galvanized.
   The stance ``is certainly not jobs-producing, but we don't
believe it's jobs-destructive either,'' Wages said.
   The union, which represents about 40,000 oil workers and 70,000
chemical and atomic workers, is pushing for more effective recovery
of oil at existing fields rather than exploratory drilling in
environmentally sensitive areas.
   Wages conceded that enhanced recovery is more expensive than
searching for new gushers.
   ``No one is forcing the industry to make the hard judgments
about spending the money that's required for secondary recovery,''
he said. ``We have a lot of fields out there that have not been
flooded, that have not been steam injected. The oil is sitting
there.''
   He also mentioned the extraction of oil from shale, a type of
rock, as an alternative to coastal exploration.
   ``Exxon was one of the promoters of the oil shale projects out
where I come from, in Colorado,'' Wages said. ``And one bright
sunshiny day they just picked up, closed down and told everybody
they were laid off. But they would have the American public, the
press, the government and everyone believe that it's absolutely
essential to drill in Alaska. Why? Because no one will take the
economic positions that have to be taken to develop other sources.''
   Wages also ridiculed industry and government officials who say
coastal drilling is essential for national security.
   ``That is a specious argument. It's inconsistent with the
facts,'' Wages said.
   There are no government restrictions on oil imports and as a
result, imports of both crude oil and refined products such as
gasoline, heating oil and distillate oils are approaching historic
highs, he said.
   At the same time, record numbers of American refineries have
been shut down in the last five years.
   ``We don't have enough refining capacity to meet demand ...
based on how much we are importing,'' Wages said.
   ``All of the positions that the industry and the Bush
administration are taking are inconsistent with national
security,'' Wages said.
   ``National security is not served by the Saudi Arabian-Texaco
joint venture. It's not served by the Venezuelans' joint venture
with Citgo, Champlin and Unocal.
   ``It's like saying we won't let the Soviets work in our defense
plants, but we'll let the Soviet government operate them.''
   Wages hopes to win support before the memory of Valdez fades.
   ``We'd like Congress to take up the nation's energy policy now,
before the ghost of the Valdez is gone,'' he said. ``Because as
long as that ghost is there, there's not going to be drilling up
there. When that ghost disappears there will be a subtle, quiet,
subterranean move to make sure that they are permitted to drill.''

<TEXT>
   Donald J. Trump, the
quintessential wheeler-dealer, faces a new kind of board in his
newest venture, ``Trump The Game.''
   The real estate mogul has joined forces with board game
manufacturer Milton Bradley Co., which expects the game to be the
biggest seller in its 129-year history.
   Trump flew in his private helicopter to Milton Bradley
headquarters here Thursday to fulfill a promise to the company.
   ``They were intent on having me come up to meet the real
people,'' he said. ``These are the people doing the work. To hell
with the executives.''
   Many of the 2,300 workers at the western Massachusetts factory
clapped at each stop in the 45-minute visit, women sighed ``Isn't
he handsome?'' and men lined up for autographs of the paper money
that bears his likeness and comes in denominations no smaller than
$10 million.
   More than 2 million of the games are scheduled for production by
year's end. It is the No. 1 seller in the 300 stores that have
received advance copies, Milton Bradley President George Ditomassi
said.
   Neither the company nor Trump will reveal his royalties, but
both said he is donating proceeds to charities for the homeless and
for research into AIDS, cerebral palsy and multiple sclerosis.
   The board game is a sophisticated battle in which players first
bid against each other _ using the fake cash and Trump cards, of
course _ for airlines, casinos, luxury hotels and other Trump
properties, then try to negotiate deals.
   Trump said the game is tough even for a veteran of the
high-stakes business world like him, but he resisted explaining its
appeal. ``If I said it, you'd say I have a big ego, so why say it?''
   The idea for the game came from an independent inventor from
Chicago, who suggested Milton Bradley, a division of Hasbro Inc.,
as the manufacturer.
   Trump said he settled on the nation's largest board game maker
because ``the loyalty, decisiveness and professionalism of this
company is just unbelievable.'' As the applause died down, he
barked at workers: ``OK, get some overtime.''
   During a news conference later, Trump denied rumors that he
planned to run for mayor of New York, which had surfaced after he
took out a full-page newspaper advertisement recently supporting
the death penalty and increased police presence.
   And he sneered at the suggestion that a new bidder for the
Eastern Airlines shuttle could affect his $365 million offer.
``It's not serious,'' he said of the bid from America West Airlines
Inc. ``I have not even heard of them.''
   Besides, he said, his contract with Eastern guarantees him a lot
of money even if the deal falls through.

<TEXT>
   Profitless pecan producers have expressed
optimism about a promotion plan that would help them compete with
their arch enemies: walnuts and almonds.
   ``There have been no profits in the pecan industry in the last
three or four years,'' said grower Fred Beshears of Monticello, Fla.
   Beshears, one of about 20 speakers Thursday at the 24th annual
conference of the Georgia Pecan Growers Association, said almond
and walnut growers spend $15 million and $10 million, respectively,
on promotion.
   In contrast, previous efforts to unite the pecan industry have
failed, so there has been no concerted effort to increase
consumption.
   ``They're educating the consumer to eat walnuts and almonds, but
people outside the pecan belt don't know about the benefits of
pecans,'' said Beshears, president of the Federated Pecan Growers,
a group that represents growers in all 16 pecan-producing states.
   Speakers at the meeting discussed marketing, economics, pest
control and growing techniques. The 200 growers attending packed a
conference hall in the morning when Beshears discussed the proposed
federal marketing plan.
   Under the plan, growers would be assessed half a cent on each
pound of pecans they sell. The assessment would generate $1 million
to $1.5 million a year for research and advertising, he said.
   A bill establishing the marketing plan is scheduled to be
introduced within a week by U.S. Sens. Wyche Fowler of Georgia and
David Boren of Oklahoma. A 15-member board would oversee the
program.
   Beshears said growers will emphasize the nutritious qualities of
pecans.
   ``Pecans are very healthy and nutritious,'' he said. ``They have
no cholesterol. They're high in protein. I wish we could say they
improve a person's sex life.''
   Beshears said the per capita consumption of pecans has remained
steady in recent years, while Americans ate more walnuts and
almonds.
   From 1970 to 1987, pecan prices climbed 64 percent, while walnut
and almond prices jumped 103 percent and 214 percent, respectively.
   Georgia is the nation's largest pecan producer. Other leading
states are Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Alabama, Louisiana and
Mississippi.
   ``We've been in a real cost squeeze,'' said Tom Crocker, a
horticulturist with the University of Georgia Extension Service.
``All our costs are going up, and we're receiving less for the
nuts. Walnut and almond growers are organized, and we're not.''

assign the case to another judge Thursday.
   The assignment committee for the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York held that ``no circumstance has
arisen'' that would ``make it appropriate to reassign the case or
any part of it to another judge.''
   The settlement has been placed on hold for nearly a month
because of a legal challenge to U.S. District Judge Milton Pollack,
who is assigned to the case.
   Former Drexel junk bond chief Michael Milken, who is not part of
the settlement, is challenging Pollack's impartiality. The matter
is before the U.S. Supreme Court.
   A federal appeals court has issued a stay, preventing Pollack
from taking any further action, including considering _ and
possibly approving _ the settlement until the Supreme Court decides
whether it will consider Milken's appeal.
   Meanwhile, the appeals court's refusal to assign a different
judge continues to delay the civil settlement as well as Drexel's
record plea bargain to criminal charges.
   Resolution of the SEC pact also is needed before Drexel can
formally plead guilty to six felonies and pay $650 million to
settle criminal charges brought by the U.S. attorney's office in
Manhattan.
   ``We're going to meet and decide what to do next,'' SEC
Solicitor Paul Gonson said Thursday. ``We're obviously very
disappointed.''
   A Drexel spokesman, Steven Anreder, said the investment banking
giant also was disappointed.
   ``We believe it would be in everyone's best interest to have the
settlement reviewed and approved.''
   Drexel and the SEC have twice asked the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals to reconsider its stay to allow Pollack to handle the
settlement or else assign the case to a different judge.
   But the appeals court said it didn't have authority.
   The SEC and Drexel then tried to get the district court
assignment committee to temporarilly assign the case to another
judge to consider the settlement.
   The SEC said it ``strongly believes it is in the public interest
and important to the protection of investors'' to finalize the
settlement ``as expedititously as possible.''
   But the three-judge panel, headed by Chief Judge Charles L.
Brieant, also nixed the idea, saying it hadn't been shown any
evidence ``that such delay, which may result from awaiting action
by the Supreme Court, will affect the public interest adversely.''
   The panel also noted that Pollack ``has not requested of this
committee that all or any part of this action be assigned to
another judge, and gives us no present indication of intending to
do so.''
   Drexel originally battled to get Pollack to excuse himself from
the case because his wife stands to make a hefty profit from a
debt-financed acquisition Drexel helped arrange.
   Pollack refused to step down from the case and the 2nd Circuit,
which delayed further district court proceedings pending its
decision, upheld Pollack in November.
   Drexel eventually dropped its objections to Pollack but the
delay was extended, when Milken and his brother, Lowell, who were
both indicted for racketeering and securities law violations last
month, sought to argue the issue before the Supreme Court.

<TEXT>
   The California Supreme Court has upheld
most of Proposition 103, a landmark law that places new controls on
insurance companies, but insurance rates probably won't plummet
soon.
   The surprising unanimous ruling Thursday has some important
long-term consequences for the California insurance industry and
its millions of customers, who now have laws to guard against
geographic discrimination, policy non-renewals and uncontrolled
rate increases.
   But for the short term, rates for car, property and liability
insurance appear to be in the hands of the state's newly powerful
insurance commissioner, Roxani Gillespie.
   Gillespie, an appointee of Gov. George Deukmejian, is, like many
of her predecessors, a former insurance executive. Proposition 103
strengthens the office and seeks to sever its ties with the
industry by making it an elective position, starting next year.
Until then, Gillespie occupies a particularly sensitive post
because of the court ruling.
   Proposition 103, approved by voters in November, was supposed to
roll back insurance rates 20 percent below November 1987 levels and
freeze them until this November, unless an insurer could show a
``substantial threat of insolvency.'' The prospects were for a
relatively inflexible freeze, with few exceptions.
   But in the one important aspect of Thursday's ruling that
favored insurers, the court said the ``threat of insolvency''
standard was too narrow and failed to guarantee a ``fair rate of
return,'' the constitutional requirement established by the court
in rent-control cases.
   Rejecting arguments that the freeze was justified as a temporary
measure to compensate for uncontrolled rate increases, Justice
Allen Broussard said, ``The asserted rise in insurance rates ... is
a long-term, chronic situation which will not be solved by
compelling insurers to sell at less than a fair return for a year.''
   The court left the rollback in place, at least on paper, to take
effect when the ruling becomes final in 30 days, barring an
extension or appeal. But insurers will be allowed to apply to
Gillespie for immediate exemptions, and to implement rate increases
on their own while she considers the applications.
   Any amount that the commissioner considers ``excessive'' or
``unfairly discriminatory'' must be refunded, plus interest.
   In addition, starting this November, any proposed rate increase
will have to be approved by Gillespie before taking effect, the
first time the state has required advance approval of insurance
rates.
   The measure also calls for a further 20 percent discount for
``good drivers,'' defined as those with no more than one moving
violation in three years.
   It's ``reasonable to assume'' that many companies will seek
exemptions from the 20 percent rollback, said Thomas Conneely,
president of the Association of California Insurance Companies.
   Gillespie's department, which is being expanded, currently lacks
the staff, forms and office space to handle an expected flood of
exemption requests.
   ``We will be there to monitor every action,'' promised
Proposition 103 author Harvey Rosenfield. He said insurance
companies should implement the rollback and refund any rates above
that amount since last November.
   Gillespie's department also must decide when auto insurers may
cancel or refuse to renew policies, under a section of the
initiative that was upheld by the court.
   The provision allows non-renewal only in cases of fraud,
non-payment or a ``substantial increase in the hazard insured
against.'' No definition has been provided for a ``substantial
increase,'' and insurers have already raised questions over whether
it would cover, for example, the addition of a teen-age driver in a
household.
   Insurers raised a constitutional challenge against the
provision, saying it could not be applied to insurance policies
that were issued before last November without violating contractual
rights. Broussard disagreed.
   The infringement on contracts was ``relatively moderate,'' he
said, and was outweighed by the public interest in keeping
insurance available to all, particularly in light of fears that
many insurers would refuse to renew policies if Proposition 103
passed.
   Broussard also noted that insurers still can withdraw from the
state, with approval by Gillespie's department.
   The commissioner has cited Proposition 103's non-renewal
provisions in prohibiting several companies from pulling out of
California without arranging substitute coverage for their
customers.
   Another important provision that will soon be before the
department changes the rules for setting auto insurance rates.
   Insurance companies, citing differences in costs, traditionally
have varied rates between geographic areas, prompting complaints by
many city residents that insurance was unavailable or unaffordable.
Proposition 103 requires rates to be based primarily on a driver's
record, with geography considered only if the Department of
Insurance allows it.

<HEAD>Dollar Moving in Narrow Range, Gold Falls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was fluctuating in a narrow range in
Europe this morning, with trading made nervous by the prospect of
central bank intervention later during the session.
   Gold prices fell.
   Supported by relatively high U.S. interest rates, and
expectations that interest rates may rise even further, the market
was bidding the dollar up, traders said. International monetary
authorities, on the other side, were ready to intervene and stop
the dollar's advance, they said.
   One Italian trader said the central banks were likely to wait
until after the release today of the U.S. unemployment report for
April.
   The Tokyo market was closed for Children's Day, a national
holiday. In London, the dollar was quoted at 134.25 yen compared
with 133.95 yen Thursday.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Thursday:
   _1.8955 West German marks, up from 1.8915
   _1.6910 Swiss francs, up from 1.6860
   _6.3970 French francs, up from 6.3875
   _2.1361 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1290
   _1,384.50 Italian lire, up from 1,380.00
   _1.1835 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1841
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.6768, compared with
$1.6841 Thursday.
   Gold opened in London at $376.80 a troy ounce, down from $378.25
bid late Thursday. At midmorning, the city's five major bullion
dealers fixed a recommended price of $377.30.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $377.20, down from $379 bid late
Wednesday. The market was closed Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 75 cents to close at $378.41.
   Silver was quoted in London today at $5.63 a troy ounce, down
from Thursday's $5.66.

   Share prices were slightly higher in early trading
today on the London Stock Exchange before release of U.S.
unemployment figures for April.
   At midday, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
was up 2.1 points, or 0.1 percent, at 2,121.1.
   At its best, the index was up 3.4 points shortly after the

   The U.S. unemployment report could help determine the near-term

<TEXT>
   The Detroit Free Press has won permission from
its parent company to publish for another year or until the U.S.
Supreme Court decides the fate of a joint operating agreement with
The Detroit News.
   The arrangement announced Thursday calls on the Free Press to
make cuts so its losses are less than $23 million.
   The Free Press lost $22.7 million last year and Publisher David
Lawrence Jr. said he was confident the paper could hold that pace
through cuts in color, news space, travel and streamlined business
practices.
   ``Absolutely this is possible, or else it would be stupid,''
Lawrence said Thursday. ``We are confident we can achieve this
goal.''
   The board of directors of Knight-Ridder Inc. decided unanimously
at a meeting Thursday morning in Miami to continue publication.
   When the Supreme Court decided Monday to hear a challenge of the
JOA, with a decision expected next year, some analysts wondered if
Knight-Ridder would absorb the Free Press' losses for another year.
   The Free Press and The News, owned by Gannett Co., have sought
the partial merger since 1986. The papers aim to cut costs by
combining advertising, circulation and production operations while
keeping separate news and editorial departments.
   Gannett hasn't released annual loss figures, but has said the
News lost $64.95 million from 1980 through 1987.
   The Free Press also said it and the News will reopen contract
negotiations at once with both newspapers' unions. More than 3,000
union employees have gone without contractual raises since 1986.

<HEAD>UMW, Community Group Join To Pressure Bank</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A grass-roots housing group from Brooklyn,
N.Y., and the United Mine Workers joined to pressure Manufacturers
Hanover Trust because the bank extended credit to a company the
union is striking, a spokesman for the housing organization says.
   The UMW went on strike against Pittston Coal Group Inc. of St.
Paul, Va., last month.
   ``We're sort of joining hands with them in terms of trying to
put pressure on an entity which, in one way or another, is
supporting Pittston,'' said Peter Sawell, a spokesman for the
Association of Community Organization for Reform Now (ACORN).
   ACORN and UMW filed papers with the Federal Reserve on Thursday
asking it to block Manufacturers's purchase of 11 branches of
Goldome Federal Savings Bank.
   The groups claim Manufacturers broke the law by failing to make
mortgage loans in predominantly black or Hispanic neighborhoods in
Brooklyn.
   The Community Reinvestment Act requires that banks meet the
credit needs of their entire communities, and not just
higher-income neighborhoods in their service areas.
   Asked why UMW was concerned about banking practices in Brooklyn,
where it has no members, UMW spokesman Kenneth Zinn said:
   ``... the role that they're playing is to generally forsake
low-income and poor people in the community for large companies for
leveraged buyouts, for high-income neighborhoods, and we think
there's something the matter with that.''
   UMW has been attempting to put pressure on Pittston through
several banks, including Manufacturers Hanover, that extended a
$100 million line of credit to Pittston in December 1987.
   UMW has charged the credit line was Pittston's ``strike fund.''
About 1,500 miners in Virginia and West Virginia had been working
without a contract for 14 months when they went on strike April 5.
   In February, the UMW announced the withdrawal of $30 million
from Crestar Fianancial Corp., one of the five banks extending the
line of credit to Pittston. The UMW's international union withdrew
$6.7 million from the bank, while the Bakery and Confectionery
Union's pension fund pulled out $23 million.
   ``Clearly, we started looking at Manufacturers Hanover when we
saw what they were doing with their capital assets in terms of the
loan to Pittston,'' Zinn said. ``Whether this puts pressure on
them, I don't know. That's for the bank to decide.''
   MHT spokesman John Stefans said his company has been found by
federal and state banking regulators to be in compliance with the
Community Reinvestment Act.
   Stefans said a UMW official spoke at the bank's annual meeting
April 21 in New York and asked the bank to withdraw its portion of
the line of credit.
   The bank spokesman said he had not seen the ACORN-UMW papers and
could not respond directly. But he said the bank had not made loans
for one- to four-family houses until recently.
   The union and ACORN charged in their papers that while 43
percent of Brooklyn's population lives in predominantly white
census tracts, ``Manny Hanny has progressively made more of of its
loans _ 67 percent in 1986, 68 percent in 1987 and 69 percent in
1988 _ in these tracts.''
   They said that in census areas with more than 75 percent
minority residents, ``where 57 percent of Brooklyn's population
lives, Manufacturers Hanover granted far fewer loans.''

<HEAD>Trump's Bid for Atlantis Challenged By Other Offers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five offers higher than Donald
Trump's $63 million agreement to buy Elsinore's Atlantis Casino
Hotel have been made to the casino's state-appointed conservator.
   Bob Stupak, owner of Vegas World Hotel-Casino in Las Vegas,
offered $64 million on Thursday for the Atlantis, just above
Trump's signed agreement.
   Trump intends to close the Atlantis casino and operate it as a
hotel, but Stupak said he would keep the casino open.
   ``The senior citizens and disabled of New Jersey will continue
to benefit from the approximately $6 million in casino win taxes
paid by the Atlantis, and I have every intention of retaining the
Atlantis employees on their jobs,'' he said in a statement.
   Joseph M. Nolan, the conservator operating the Atlantis since
its license expired April 14, said he is accepting purchase offers
for the financially failing gaming hall.
   Nolan told the state Casino Control Commission he questions the
validity of Trump's agreement with Elsinore Corp. because it may
have been signed after he became conservator.
   Trump was not available for comment Thursday, said his secretary
in New York, Norma Foerderer.
   Nolan said he has already received four bids for the Atlantis,
either in writing or by telephone, but refused to identify the
interested parties or their bids. He said all the new bids would
keep the Atlantis casino in tact.
   Stupak said he would keep the Atlantis' three-floor casino open
even though it has not proven to be a financial success.
   Stupak has challenged Trump before. In March, Stupak bet $1
million that he could beat the billionaire developer at the board
game titled ``Trump: The Game.'' Trump refused the challenge.
   Stupak, 47, is a colorful Las Vegas figure who lost a close race
for mayor in 1987. A Pittsburgh native, he settled in Las Vegas in
1972 and established a Dine Out coupon club. He opened the Million
Dollar Historic Gambling Museum in 1974, which mysteriously burned
down six weeks later.
   He built Vegas World on the same site, opening in 1979.

   Prime Computer Inc. shareholders have tendered
more than 66 percent of the company's outstanding stock to MAI
Basic Four Inc. under a $20-per-share hostile takeover bid, MAI
Basic says.
   The tender offer is still enjoined by a federal court in Boston,
but MAI said this week it was preparing to satisfy the sole
remaining condition for ending the injunction.
   MAI Basic said Thursday it was mailing Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc.'s year-end financial statements to all Prime stockholders to
comply with an order from U.S. District Judge A. David Mazzone.
   Mazzone previously ruled the statements from Drexel, MAI's
investment bank and adviser, needed to be provided to shareholders
to comply with federal disclosure requirements. He said he would
lift the injunction 10 days after MAI certifies the statements have
been sent out.
   MAI, a Tustin, Calif.-based computer company, said it has
extended its offer, valued at about $970 million, until May 31.
   The injunction does not prevent stockholders from tendering
their shares. But it does block MAI, controlled by New York
investor Bennett S. LeBow, from taking ownership of the stock.
   Natick-based Prime is a minicomputer maker with a second largest
share of the market for computer-aided design and manufacturing
systems behind International Business Machines Corp.
   Prime's board of directors has rejected MAI's bid as too low. A
Prime spokeswoman, Paula Levis, said it is continuing to look for a
buyer willing to pay more than $20 per share.
   MAI also has announced plans to wage a proxy battle for control
of Prime's board at its June 14 annual meeting.

   The state is challenging USAir's proposed
purchase of eight Eastern Airlines gates in Philadelphia, saying
the transaction could reduce competition and lead to higher ticket
prices.
   The sale, worth about $85 million to strike-bound Eastern, would
give USAir 23 of 49 gates at Philadelphia International Airport,
Pennsylvania Attorney General Ernie Preate said in a motion filed
in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York.
   USAir already controls 36 of 51 gates the Greater Pittsburgh
International Airport, he said.
   ``USAir's fares per mile for flights of 200 to 500 miles to or
from Pittsburgh are 12 percent higher than the average fare for
short-haul flights to or from other cities,'' Preate said.
   ``The lack of competition is hurting Pennsylvania consumers, and
the situation will only worsen if USAir is able to increase its
dominance over Philadelphia,'' he said.
   The petition, filed Thursday, asks Bankruptcy Court Judge Burton
R. Lifland to reject the proposed sale and order Eastern to offer
the gates to other airlines before a scheduled May 23 court hearing.
   USAir spokesman John Bronson called the arguments ``seriously
flawed'' and said they will ``inhibit growth of air service in
hiladlephia.''
   Court papers also said Braniff, Midway and Pan Am Express, an
East Coast shuttle, are seeking gates in Philadelphia, and TWA is
considering establishing a Philadelphia hub.
   USAir on the fifth day of the Machinists strike against Eastern
that started March 4 announced it had agreed to buy the gates after
months of negotiations.

   The stock market staged a broad rally today,
inspired by new evidence of slowing economic growth.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 13.74 to
2,398.64 in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 4 to 1 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 755 up, 184 down and
483 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 28.68 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The Labor Department reported that the civilian unemployment
rate took an unexpected 0.3 percentage point jump in April, to 5.3
percent.
   The monthly data also showed an increase of 117,000 in nonfarm
payroll employment, substantially less than most advance estimates
on Wall Street.
   The figures reinforced the spreading belief on Wall Street that
the economy has been slowing in recent months, responding to
credit-tightening by the Federal Reserve.
   What remains less clear, analysts said, is whether the Fed is
starting to see any results in its primary mission of reining in
inflation.
   Nevertheless, the news sparked a rally in the bond market,
sending interest rates lower, and stocks followed suit.
   Gainers among the blue chips included General Electric, up ] at
48~; International Business Machines, up | at 111\; Exxon, up \ at
42|; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, up \ at 34}, and Eastman
Kodak, up ] at 43|.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.80 to 173.01. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .64 at 346.53.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 8.80 to
2,384.90.
   Declining issues slightly outnumbered advances on the NYSE, with

<HEAD>Indian Tribes Mulling Bond Sales To Raise Cash; Japanese Intrigued</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Indian tribes are exploring major bond
issues as a way to raise cash for tribal development projects, an
idea boosted by a recent change in federal law and one that has
piqued the interest of the Japanese.
   Late last month, Daiwa Securities America, U.S. arm of the
Japanese investment house, gathered tribal leaders, government
officials, Indian experts and others in New York for a daylong
conference on tribal financing.
   Charles Entwistle, a Daiwa senior vice president, said the
meeting was designed to present financing opportunities to both the
tribes and investors.
   ``It looks like a good opportunity for channeling some of the
Japanese money coming into the United States,'' Entwistle said.
``We're satisfied that the business is there. Now it's just a
matter of can we put deals together.''
   The effort is prompted by an amendment to the federal Indian
Finance Act signed into law last September. The amendment allows
tribes to float bonds that would be backed by government guarantees
for up to 90 percent of their value.
   Such government backing would put tribal bonds on par with many
bonds issued by government agencies.
   Government guarantees allow the bond issuer to pay a lower
interest rate since the buyers are assured of getting most of their
money back should there be a default. The lower interest rate makes
the bonds cheaper for the tribes to issue.
   Daiwa is working on a major Indian funding project that would
amount to hundreds of millions of dollars, Entwistle said, though
he declined to give details.
   In addition to bonds, funding mechanisms for tribal projects
under exploration by Daiwa include joint ventures, equity interests
and private placements, or debt issues that are sold privately and
not publicly traded, Entwistle said.
   One bond issue the company is working on would provide about
$6.5 million for the Chickasaw Nation to buy the Arbuckle
Wilderness, a 485-acre drive-through park and exotic wild animal
preserve in Oklahoma that is a major tourist attraction.
   However, the government-guaranteed bond issue has been delayed
by the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs, which must approve the
financing.
   The BIA and its parent, the Interior Department, have not
finished writing regulations to implement the amendment to the
Indian Finance Act, said BIA spokesman Carl Shaw.
   ``No one knew at the time that amendment was passed that there
would have to be new regulations written,'' Shaw said last week.
   In addition, the BIA must receive funding for a reserve fund to
guarantee the bond issues, Shaw said. A request for that funding
was not submitted to Congress this year because ``we don't feel
like we can request those funds'' due to budgetary constraints,
Shaw said.
   The soonest the reserve fund could be approved, allowing
government-backed tribal bonds to be issued, would be fiscal 1991,
which starts October 1, 1990, assuming Congress approves the
funding by then, Shaw said.
   Entwistle said he believes the BIA is creating unnecessary
delays. Nowhere in the amendment does it say that new regulations
or a new reserve fund are needed, he said, pointing out that a
reserve fund was created under the existing Indian Finance Act.
   ``The law was written to be enacted immediately,'' he said.
   Indian tribes can float bonds under the original Indian Finance
Act, which was approved in the early 1980s, but the bonds aren't
guaranteed by the government. Instead, the tribes must back the
issues by natural-resource earnings or other tribal revenue.
   The amended finance law provides enhanced capability for the
tribes to raise money, Shaw said.
   Charles Blackwell, an Indian attorney who is a consultant to
Daiwa, said the BIA dispute is overshadowed by the significance of
the Indian gathering in New York.
   ``Leaders from 20-plus tribes came to Wall Street bringing their
deals and saying `Let's do business,''' he said. ``It was the first
time in history.
   ``Congress is 100 percent behind the individual initiatives that
are taking place in Indian country,'' he added. ``And the tribes
themselves are emerging as very powerful business entities in the
United States. The BIA will fall in line.''

   United Airlines and a Boeing Co. subsidiary are
facing a class-action suit by a couple who were aboard a plane on
which nine passengers were sucked out a hole created when a cargo
door broke off the aircraft.
   The suit alleges that United and Boeing Commercial Airplane Co.,
which produces the Boeing 747-100 jet, were negligent in operating
and building the plane. It asked for compensatory damages of more
than $1 million and punitive damages to be set by a jury.
   Clinton and Lillian Zimlich of Broadview Heights, Ohio, asked
that the U.S. District Court suit be made a class action on behalf
of the 320 people who were aboard United Flight 811 on Feb. 24.
   The suit alleges that United failed to properly maintain the
aircraft and allowed it to become unsafe. It said Boeing knew, or
should have known, about defects in the plane which might make it
unsafe.
   Joe Hopkins, a spokesman at United's Chicago headquarters, said,
``We haven't seen the suit and have no comment.''
   Craig Martin, a Boeing spokesman in Seattle, said the aircraft
manufacturer is not going to comment on matters that are under
litigation.
   Zimlich, a semi-retired real estate executive, escaped injury as
the plane turned around while en route to New Zealand and returned
to Honolulu with a front cargo door and part of its fuselage ripped
off. The accident occurred while the plane was over the Pacific
Ocean.
   His wife, a retired teacher, suffered an ear injury as the plane
quickly depressurized and also suffered neck and back injuries
during the emergency ramp evacuation of the plane, according to the
couple's attorney, Jamie R. Lebovitz.
   ``Emotionally, they're not doing too well,'' added Lebovitz, who
said the couple have had trouble sleeping since the accident, which
occurred as they began a vacation to New Zealand with Mrs.
Zimlich's sister.
   Several suits have been filed in Honolulu by other survivors,
according to Lebovitz.

<HEAD>Wall Street Sees No Severe Housing Slump</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Like a good many other American industries,
housing and real estate have lately felt the pinch of high interest
rates.
   But some Wall Street analysts maintain that the homebuilding
business is going through nothing much worse than a moderate down
cycle that won't have dire or far-reaching consequences for the
economy.
   In fact, a few observers argue that stocks of homebuilding
companies, which generally have turned in an uninspired showing
over the past year or two, could soon start to revive if interest
rates are ready to come down.
   Figures published by the Value Line Investment survey show that
housing starts, the historical gauge of the homebuilding industry's
health, have been declining steadily from a peak they reached more
than three years ago.
   In the first quarter of 1986, work was started on new private
dwelling units at the rate of 1.94 million a year.
   In the second quarter of this year, by contrast, Value Line
estimates the total will come in at an annual rate of 1.40 million.
   Still, the investment advisory firm says it believes housing
starts will bottom out toward the end of this year not far below
current levels.
   ``That would be the culmination of a historically mild decline
that has developed gradually from the 1986 peak,'' says analyst
Stephen Grant in Value Line's recently published quarterly
appraisal of the industry outlook.
   ``Most of this decline has occurred in multi-family housing, due
to previous overbuilding stimulated by tax laws that have since
been changed.
   ``Single-family housing starts have a good shot at topping the 1
million level in 1989 for an unprecedented seventh consecutive
year, after troughing at 660,000 in 1982.''
   Even if housing is in for a more extended period of weakness
than analysts now expect, some observers contend that it need not
drag the rest of the economy down with it.
   In the past, weakness in housing traditionally ushered in
recessions in the overall economy. When tight money sent home
buying and homebuilding into a slump, demand dropped off for
building materials, home furnishings, appliances _ and a ripple
effect occurred.
   In the 1980s, however, past patterns haven't held, says Robert
Barbera, economist at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   While housing has been strong ever since the early 1980s, he
notes, manufacturing is in the early stages of recovery from a
severe mid-'80s slump.
   ``Housing and factory activity are out of phase at present,''
Barbera says, ``and that enhances the prospects for a slide in U.S.
housing activity without an economy-wide downturn.''
   Barbera acknowledges that it's always dangerous in financial or
economic forecasting to adopt the premise that ``things are
different this time than they were in previous cycles.''
   But analysts say several things have indeed occurred lately to
change the nature of the homebuilding business _ including the
advent of the adjustable-rate mortgage and the growth of the
mortgage-backed securities market, which channels additional money
into real estate finance.
   Says Grant: ``We believe the housing cycle will go through
narrower swings than in the past.''

<HEAD>City Pension Fund Threatens Exxon Board Members Over Valdez Oil Spill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN SHANAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the city pension system says other
stockholders should join him in voting against the Exxon Corp.
board unless the company gives assurances that it has taken steps
to prevent another disaster like the Alaskan oil spill.
   City Finance Commissioner Anthony E. Shorris and Comptroller
Harrison J. Goldin met with Exxon President Lee R. Raymond on
Thursday.
   Shorris said they wanted to ensure the safety of the city's $250
million investment in Exxon stock and expressed concern that such
an environmentally devastating spill not happen again.
   Shorris said Exxon management ``listened to our concerns and
asked for a couple of days'' in which to come back with a response.
   ``We told them that depending on your answers, we will vote
against the board'' at the company's May 18 stockholders meeting,
he said.
   Although the pension fund holds 6 million shares, or less than 1
percent of Exxon stock, Shorris said, ``We would obviously be in
contact with other pension systems throughout the country to see if
we could get them to back us.''
   Exxon spokeswoman Sarah Johnson declined to comment on
Thursday's meeting, saying that meetings with investors are private.
   Shorris is chairman of the New York City Employees Retirement
System which, together with police, fire and teacher pension
systems, controls about $20 billion in investments.
   Mayor Edward I. Koch commented later that the oil spill at
Valdez, Alaska, and Exxon's slow response ``are two outrages that
cannot adequately be described in words.''
   He said he supported Shorris' decision to ``use NYCERS' leverage
to make Exxon the environmentally sound corporate citizen it should
have been long ago.''
   Shorris said the city was willing to wait a ``couple of days''
to hear back from the oil company, but cautioned that ``time is
short.''
   He said the city wanted to know if any changes were contemplated
in management structure of the firm, what kind of research and
development programs it has to deal with oil spills of the Valdez
magnitude and what contingency plans it has to deal with such
mishaps.
   He said that while the city is concerned with the environment,
the pension trustees also have ``a fiduciary obligation to the
pensioneers to make sure their funds are safe.''

   Personal income is growing at an uneven pace
in America's cities, with the fastest growth along the East Coast
and the slowest in oil-producing states, a government report shows.
   Twenty-three of the nation's 318 metropolitan areas in 1987
registered per capita income growth at least 2 percentage points
above the national average of 6 percent, the Commerce Department
reported Thursday.
   Seven of those cities were in New England; six were in the
Middle Atlantic region; five were in the Southeast.
   Income in 60 metropolitan areas, meanwhile, grew at a rate that
was at least 2 percentage points below the national average.
Forty-one of those areas were in the oil-producing states of
Alaska, Colorado, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas and Wyoming.
   ``A lot of growth in New England is driven by services and
high-tech industries,'' said Kathy Albetski of the department's
Bureau of Economic Analysis. ``The slow growth was driven by the
weakness in oil.''
   The fastest growth rate was recorded in the
Visalia-Tulare-Porterville region of California, but that was
largely because incomes there were relatively low to begin with.
The area's per capita income rose 9.7 percent to $12,968, a level
still well below the national average.
   At the other end of the scale, two regions registered declines
in 1987: per capita income fell 1.4 percent in Flint, Mich., to
$14,723, and dropped 0.6 percent in Lafayette, La., to $12,363.
   In a ranking of income levels, first place belonged to the
Bridgeport-Stamford-Norwalk-Danbury area of Connecticut, with per
capita income of $26,316.
   Bringing up the rear was the McAllen-Edinburg-Mission area of
Texas, at $7,001.
   The first- and last-place areas were the same as in 1986, but
the gap between them grew as the 9.1 percent rate of per capita
income growth in the Bridgeport area more than doubled the 4.2
percent pace in the McAllen region.
   The per capita income gap between the two regions was $19,315 in
1987, up from $17,412 a year earlier.
   For the nation as a whole, per capita income in 1987 was
$15,484, up from $14,609 a year earlier.
   In addition to the Bridgeport region, here are the other
metropolitan areas in the top 10 for 1987 per capita personal
income:
   San Francisco, $24,593; Bergen-Passaic, N.J., $23,040;
Middlesex-Somerset-Hunterdon, N.J., $22,783; Nassau-Suffolk, N.Y.,
$22,001; Washington D.C.-Maryland-Virginia, $21,539; San Jose,
Calif., $21,510; Anaheim-Santa Ana, Calif., $21,444; Lake County,
Ill., $21,432, and West Palm Beach-Boca Raton-Delray Beach, Fla.,
$21,246.
   In addition to the McAllen region, here are the other
metropolitan areas in the bottom 10 for 1987 per capita personal
income:
   Laredo, Texas, $7,035; Brownsville-Harlingen, Texas, $7,409;
Provo-Orem, Utah, $8,870; El Paso, Texas, $9,484; Las Cruces, N.M.,
$9,578; Pascagoula, Miss., $10,231; Houma-Thibodaux, La., $10,582;
Jacksonville, N.C., $10,668, and Bryan-College Station, Texas,
$10,688.

on Wall Street.
   The figures reinforced the spreading belief on Wall Street that
the economy has been slowing in recent months, responding to
credit-tightening by the Federal Reserve.

   Wheat prices were down following a week of steady advances.
Analysts say there is some reluctance to buying into wheat futures

for hot and dry conditions next week in winter crop areas.
   Corn and soybean futures were higher despite forecasts for more
rain over the weekend.
   In early trading, wheat was } cent lower to 2{ cents higher,

   Unemployment shot up 0.3 percentage points
last month to 5.3 percent as job growth dropped to its lowest level
in nearly three years, the government said today in a report
confirming a slowdown in the economy.
   The April jobless rate was the highest since January and moved
civilian unemployment off the more than 15-year low of 5.0 percent
posted in March.
   The report inspired a broad rally of the stock market, with the
Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks climbing 17.59 points in
the first 90 minutes of trading.
   Some analysts questioned whether the economy has slowed too much
to orchestrate a ``soft landing'' without a recession. The early
consensus was that a recession was not imminent, although many
analysts held fast to predictions one would come late this year or
next year.
   ``This is certainly consistent with a soft landing. This is not
a sign of a recession in progress,'' said economist Roger Brinner
of Data Resources Inc. in Lexington, Mass.
   The White House played down the increase in unemployment, with
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater noting that the percentage of
working-age Americans who have jobs remains ``at an all-time high
of 63.3 percent.''
   The Labor Department's survey of business found the addition of
117,000 non-farm payroll jobs in April, the lowest number since the
government reported a drop of 92,000 positions in June 1986.
   The department also revised March payroll growth to 171,000,
down from 180,000, in yet another sign of a slowing economy.
   The slower job growth contrasts sharply with the average monthly
payroll growth of 300,000 in the 12 months that ended in February.
   The number of unemployed workers also increased in April after
two months of decline, rising about 420,000 to 6.5 million,
according to the Labor Department's separate household survey.
   The business survey found that the average work week in the
non-farm private sector rose 0.4 hours to 35 hours, while the
manufacturing work week grew by 0.3 hours to 41.3 hours.
Manufacturing overtime edged up 0.1 hour to 4.0 hours.
   The department, however, said those figures may well be revised
downward because the formula for seasonally adjusting the figures
does not take into account that the Easter holiday fell in March
this year instead of April.
   The department said the civilian labor force _ the pool of
employable people _ grew by 395,000 in April, its largest monthly
jump this year. That would be greeted as good news by financial
analysts who have blamed rising wages on an unusually tight labor
market.
   Underscoring market concerns about inflation, the report said
average hourly earnings rose a seasonally adjusted 0.7 percent in
April after climbing 0.3 percent for two months.
   However, Janet Norwood, commissioner of labor statistics,
cautioned against reading the latest wage data as a major
inflationary factor, saying wage growth ``seems to occur in fits
and starts.''
   At the same time, she acknowledged that the report was another
piece in the mounting evidence of an economic slowdown.
   ``The slowdown in March and April is real,'' Ms. Norwood said in
prepared congressional testimony. ``While we are not getting net
job losses, we are creating far fewer jobs than we were even a few
months ago, and few industries are significantly expanding their
employment.''
   She said some slowdown has to be expected in the record seventh
year of the economic expansion and the slower growth did not
necessarily signal a downturn.
   The data make it increasingly unlikely that the Federal Reserve
Board will tighten credit again when its policymaking committee
meets later this month. The central bank has been keeping the tight
rein on credit to slow the economy to curb inflation, and recent
reports have shown evidence of that slowdown.
   The 117,000 growth in non-farm payrolls was about have the
number predicted by most analysts and occurred almost entirely in
the service sector. Still, the growth even in that strong sector
slowed somewhat, with wholesale trade posting only a modest gain in
jobs while finance, insurance and real estate reported declines.
   Construction posted a modest gain of 6,000 jobs after two months
of reporting declines.
   The increase in the civilian unemployment rate predominantly
affected men.
   The jobless rate among white men rose from 3.6 percent in March
to 4.0 percent last month, while among Hispanic men it shot up from
6.5 percent to 8.3 percent. Unemployment among black men rose from
9.8 percent to 10.0 percent.
   The unemployment rate among white women also rose, from 3.8
percent to 4.1 percent, while among black women it dropped from 9.1
percent to 8.8 percent. The government does not break down the
Hispanic unemployment data by sexes.
   Among black teen-agers, the demographic group with by far the
highest jobless rate, unemployment dipped from 34.8 percent to 26.2
percent in April.
   In a separate caculation of unemployment including military
personnel based in the United States, the Labor Department said the
jobless rate also rose by 0.3 percentage points, from 4.9 percent
to 5.2 percent.

   Share prices closed higher on Friday, encouraged
by renewed institutional buying on the first day of a new trading
period and some bullish signals from the U.S. unemployment figures
for April.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed 13.8
points, or 0.7 percent higher, at 2,132.8.
   It was the highest closing level since the October 1987 stock
market crash, topping the previous closing high of 2,125.4 set on
March 14.
   News that the unemployment rate rose to 5.3 percent in April
suggested the U.S economy was cooling and U.S. interest rates
wouldn't have to be raised again, dealers said.
   London share prices gained more support later in the trading
session with the start of a new two-week trading account, dealers
added.
   London's Stock Exchange divides trading into two-week and
three-week trading periods for accounting purposes.
   Volume was a moderate 589.2 million shares, up from 541.7
million shares Thursday.

   The stock market put together a spirited rally
today, inspired by new evidence of slowing economic growth.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 24.37 to
2,409.27 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 2 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 989 up, 384 down and
514 unchanged.
   The Labor Department reported that the civilian unemployment
rate took an unexpected 0.3 percentage point jump in April, to 5.3
percent.
   The monthly data also showed an increase of 117,000 in nonfarm
payroll employment, substantially less than most advance estimates
on Wall Street.
   The figures reinforced the spreading belief on Wall Street that
the economy has been slowing in recent months, responding to
credit-tightening by the Federal Reserve.
   What remains less clear, analysts said, is whether the Fed is
starting to see any results in its primary mission of reining in
inflation.
   Nevertheless, the news sparked a rally in the bond market,
sending interest rates lower, and stocks followed suit.
   Gainers among the blue chips included Philip Morris, up 2} at
129; International Business Machines, up ] at 111; Exxon, up { at
42~; Eastman Kodak, up ] at 43|, and American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph, up \ at 34}.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.27 to 173.48. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 1.70 at 347.59.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 124.12 million shares with two

<HEAD>Dollar Up in Europe Despite Intervention; Gold Off</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: A version for AMs is planned by 5:30 p.m. EDT.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar ended mostly higher in Europe Friday,
reovering from a selloff on news of a rise in the U.S. unemployment
rate and defying a concerted effort by central banks to stem its
advance.
   Gold prices moved lower.
   The dollar dropped sharply after the U.S. Labor Department
reported a jump in the U.S. unemployment rate to 5.3 percent in
April from 5 percent in March.
   The increase was consistent with recent statistics showing
slower economic activity. Some analysts say slower growth will
induce the Federal Reserve to pursue a more generous credit policy.
   Interest rates have headed up this year because the U.S. central
bank has been trying to stifle inflationary pressures by putting
the brakes on economic growth. High U.S. interest rates have
boosted demand for dollars and dollar-denominated investments.
   The Fed, the West German Bundesbank and several European central
banks pounced on the dollar when it reached the 1.89-level to the
West German mark, dealers said
   But they said the intervention was moderate and that the
underlying demand for dollars remained strong.
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.6740 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.6841 Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with rates late
Thursday included: 1.8988 West German marks, up from 1.8915; 1.6985
Swiss francs, up from 1.6860; 6.4080 French francs, up from 6.3875;
2.1285 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1290; 1,379.00 Italian lire,
down from 1,380.00; and, 1.1842 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1841.
   The Tokyo market was closed for Children's Day, a national
holiday. In London, the dollar was quoted at 134.31 yen compared
with 133.95 yen in London late Thursday.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid of $376.25 a troy ounce from
$378.25 late Thursday.
   In Zurich, gold fell to close at a bid of $375.85 compared with
$379 bid late Wednesday. The market was closed Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 75 cents to close at $378.41.
   Silver bullion prices fell on the London market where the metal
was trading at a late bid price of $5.60 a troy ounce, compared
with Thursday's $5.66.

<HEAD>Wheat Continues Strong Showing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed higher
Friday in quiet trading on the Chicago Board of Trade as
expectations of additional export of U.S. grains spurred the market.
   Wheat futures continue to show strength as a result of the offer
this week by the United States to sell 1.5 million metric tons of
grain to the Soviet Union under the export subsidy program.
   ``I think even if they are not bidding now, they will be in the
market in the near future,'' said Ted Mao, a grain specialist for
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York. ``That is keeping wheat
prices firm.''
   A day after the United States made the offer, the Soviets
announced a bid for 300,000 metric tons of wheat.
   Wheat prices were also helped along by the poor condition of the
winter crop in Kansas, caused by dry weather and heat.
   Expected Soviet demand for U.S. corn also spurred prices for
that commodity.
   ``The Soviets have made sporadic buys of corn in the past,'' Mao
said. ``The market is waiting to hear how much more buying will be
done.''
   Soybean futures rose on word of tightness in the U.S. and
Brazilian cash soybean markets.
   At the close, wheat was 1{ cents to 3\ cents higher with May at
$4.37{ a bushel; corn was 1{ cents to 5 cents higher with May at
$2.80} a bushel; oats were 3{ cents to 6\ cents higher with May at
$1.97 a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents to 10 cents higher with May
at $7.60 a bushel.

<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. on Friday
said its loss widened to $116.1 million in the first quarter from a
loss of $35.3 million for the same period a year ago.
   Revenue rose to $315.5 million from $276.7 million a year
earlier.
   Losses increased largely because of rising interest rates on
company debt and higher market costs for new products in the school
publishing division. The losses were offset by better performances
in HBJ's amusement park and insurance businesses, according to the
company's earnings statement.
   Because much of the company's business is seasonal,
first-quarter results aren't necessarily indicative of the entire
year, the company said.

<HEAD>LA Daily Management Discusses Buyout from Hearst</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Top executives of the Los Angeles Herald
Examiner are exploring the possibility of a management-led buyout
of the paper from Hearst Corp. by a group that would include
employees.
   The discussions are in a very preliminary stage, said John J.
McCabe, the Herald's chief operating executive.
   ``I think it's a long shot,'' McCabe said. ``We have to develop
a strategic plan and ascertain if there would be equity funding
available.''
   McCabe announced his plans to a group of the paper's editors
Wednesday.
   He said the proposal would be based on converting the
242,000-circulation Hearst daily to a tabloid format. The
possibility of such a conversion has been under study at the paper
for several years.
   Earlier this year representatives of the Toronto Sun Corp. had
discussions with Hearst about a possible joint venture involving
the Herald Examiner.
   But the president of the Toronto Sun, Douglas Creighton, said
that because of the Sun's heavy commitments to a new daily
newspaper in Ottawa and its simultaneous start-up of a daily
financial newspaper in Canada, his company had decided not to
proceed.
   In April, Los Angeles billionaire Marvin Davis approached Hearst
about possibly buying the Herald Examiner. But Davis, who recently
launched a $2.7 billion bid for Northwest Airlines, decided against
the move.
   Heart plans ``to continue exploring different options,'' McCabe
said. ``Obviously (Hearst) decided some months ago they were
interested in looking for a buyer.''
   Privately held Hearst has acknowledged financial losses at the
Herald Examiner but does not disclose specific figures for the
newspaper.
   In 1967, when nine unions embarked on a long strike, the Herald
had a daily circulation of 729,000, making it the nation's largest
afternoon daily.

<HEAD>Hughes Accused Of Overcharging Federal Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A high-level manager at Hughes Aircraft Co.
has accused the firm in a federal lawsuit of overcharging the
government by $40 million on the radar system for the F-18 fighter
jet and B-2 stealth bomber.
   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court last January and
unsealed late last month, alleges that top officers at Hughes
conspired to defraud the government by shifting development charges
among programs.
   Hughes Aircraft, a unit of General Motors Corp., said Thursday
in a statement that its own investigation found that all the
charges made to the government were proper.
   Filed under the Federal False Claims Act, the suit seeks $120
million in triple damages. The act allows a plaintiff to bring
lawsuits on behalf of the government and share in the recovery of
damages.
   The suit refers to a special program contract instead of
specifically identifying the B-2 program, but unidentified sources
told the Los Angeles Times that the project involved is the stealth
bomber.
   The suit was brought by William J. Schumer, who was division
contracts manager at the Hughes Radar System Group in nearby El
Segundo. Schumer is still employed by Hughes, but in a different
division.
   Attorney Dean Francis Pace, who is representing Schumer, said
the Justice Department is investigating the allegations.

<BYLINE>By EARL BOHN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Steelworkers negotiators Friday
approved a tentative contract agreement with Bethlehem Steel Corp.
that restores wage cuts workers made nearly seven years ago to help
the company avoid financial disaster.
   If ratified by the 20,500 USW members on the job at the nation's
second-largest steelmaker, the agreement would be the first among
four major producers whose contracts expire July 31.
   The 50-month agreement would immediately boost the average
hourly wage from $11.23 to $12.22, restoring an 8 percent cut
granted by the union in August 1982.
   It also restores three paid holidays and cost of living bonuses.
It improves pensions and insurance benefits and awards each worker
a $500 signing bonus and a $500 advance on this year's
profit-sharing payments.
   The offer goes next to the union's international executive board
and then to a vote by the rank-and-file. The negotiating committee
voted 18-7 in favor.
   Bethlehem's major plants are at Sparrows Point, Md., Bethlehem,
Pa., and Burns Harbor, Ind.
   ``This is an agreement that puts the past behind us and ... all
the difficult times of the 1980s,'' said USW President Lynn
Williams.
   ``The settlement recognizes that sacrifices were made by USWA
members in the past two contracts and also that Bethlehem is still
a company in transition that must continue to carefully control its
costs,'' said Bethlehem Senior Vice President Curtis Barnette, also
the company's chief negotiator.
   Bethlehem lost more than $2 billion from 1982 to 1986. Last year
it had profits of $403 million, and in the first quarter this year
$65 million.
   The workers are expected to approve the contract because of the
money it offers, but Williams said the centerpiece of the agreement
is a career development program.
   Bethlehem will pay $300,000 per month for worker training,
education and personal development.
   The program will also receive the $5 per hour Bethlehem agreed
to pay for each hour of overtime worked beyond 56 hours per week.
The penalty climbs to $7.50 per hour in 1991 and $10 per hour in
1992.
   The penalty reflects the union's distaste for heavy overtime
duty for some of its members while others have faded into
retirement, lower-paying jobs or unemployment due to the industry's
massive cutbacks since 1982.
   Williams said the career development program address the union's
desire to help workers enhance their skills and with them their job
security.
   ``We've been itching to get at the problem in a more substantial
way,'' Williams said. ``We've created an opportunity to make a more
substantial contribution to our members.''

<TEXT>
   Civilian unemployment, rising at the fastest
clip in more than three years, jumped to 5.3 percent last month,
the government said Friday in a report that was taken as the
strongest evidence yet of an economic slowdown.
   Propelling the 0.3 percentage point gain in the jobless rate was
the smallest rise in new jobs since June 1986, the Labor Department
said.
   Economists and financial markets, concerned for months that the
persistently heady economy was moving into a period of spiraling
price hikes, found both good and bad news in Friday's report.
   The Dow Jones industrial average, up more than 24 points at
mid-afternoon, closed down 2.94 points. Brokers said some investors
were apparently worried about what a slowing economy might mean for
corporate profits.
   Indeed, some analysts even wondered whether the dramatic
increase in joblessness was signalling that the danger now is one
not of inflation but of recession.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater played down the
significance of the first rise in unemployment of George Bush's
brief tenure as president, noting that the percentage of
working-age Americans with jobs ``remains at an all-time high of
63.3 percent.''
   Other economists welcomed from Friday's news.
   Roger Brinner of DRI-McGraw-Hill said the data was ``about
perfect'' for prospects of generating a soft landing for the
soaring economy _ slowing growth just enough to rein in inflation
without triggering a recession.
   ``There's no question the economy is weakening,'' said
Washington economist Michael Evans. ``But there's nothing in this
report to suggest we are heading into a recession.''
   Allen Sinai of Boston Co. Economic Advisers Inc. was more
cautious.
   He predicted a mild recession later this year and said the
economy was ``downshifting to slower growth. This is part and
parcel of the bloom being off the rose of what has been a booming
economy.''
   Economists concurred that Friday's surprising jump in the
unemployment rate will likely be enough to keep the Federal Reserve
Board from further tightening credit when it next reevaluates
monetary policy in two weeks.
   April's 5.3 percent civilian unemployment rate _ up from a
15-year low of 5.0 percent a month earlier and the biggest
one-month gain since February 1986 _ was felt most heavily by men.
   The jobless rate among white men rose from 3.6 percent to 4.0
percent; for Hispanic men, from 6.5 percent to 8.3 percent; for
black men, from 9.8 percent to 10.0 percent.
   The commissioner of labor statistics, Janet L. Norwood, who
rarely speculates on the health of the economy, told Congress,
``The slowdown in employment in March and April is real.''
   While economists have said rising unemployment is a necessary
ingredient to cooling off inflation, Friday's report provided no
immediate evidence of that cause-and-effect relationship.
   The Labor Department report, based on a monthly sampling of the
nation's households, showed that inflation, if not picking up
steam, was at least persisting. Average hourly earnings rose a
seasonally adjusted 0.7 percent in April after climbing 0.3 percent
each of the prior two months.
   Sinai said the wage gains were an indication of a coming period
of ``stagflation'' _ inflation despite slow economic growth.
   But Evans was skeptical.
   ``I tend to disbelieve that number, but it's certainly a number
to watch,'' he said. ``That's a very big number.''
   As for job growth last month, a separate department survey of
businesses found that only 117,000 non-farm payroll jobs were
created.
   At the same time, the Labor Department revised payroll growth
for March downward from 180,000 to 171,000. Over the 12-month
period that ended in February, an average of 300,000 jobs had been
created each month.
   Despite the overwhelming evidence of slower growth, the
department said that the average non-farm work week rose 0.4 hour
to 35 hours and that the manufacturing work week grew by 0.3 hour
to 41.3 hours.
   Department analysts, offering an explanation for those figures,
said the department's seasonal adjustment formula _ used to remove
periodic, predictable effects from the unemployment calculation _
assumes that Easter falls in April. The holiday was celebrated in
March this year.
   Analysts said that quirk also was a likely factor in a reported
April increase of only 5,000 jobs in retail trade, which had been
posting average monthly gains of about 60,000.
   Growth in the overall service sector was somewhat slower as
well, although service industries continued to provide the
overwhelming bulk of payroll growth _ 112,000 of the new positions.
That sector had averaged 258,000 new positions over the prior three
months.
   The net gain of 5,000 payroll positions in goods-producing
industries included a modest 6,000 increase in construction
employment after two months of declines and the second consecutive
monthly gain in mining employment. Partially offsetting those gains
was a drop of 9,000 in manufacturing employment.
   At the same time, weekly manufacturing overtime edged up 0.1
hour to an even four hours, a sure sign to analysts that managers
see even slower growth ahead and have decided to pay more overtime
in lieu of hiring additional workers.
   ``Manufacturers and other employers have decided that life may
be a little bit tough in the third and fourth quarters and they
don't want to increase their fixed costs by adding to payrolls,''
said Brinner.
   The Labor Department offered these other unemployment statistics:
   Joblessness among white women rose from 3.8 percent to 4.1
percent, but dropped for black women from 9.1 percent to 8.8
percent.
   Among black teen-agers, unemployment dipped from 34.8 percent to
26.2 percent.
   In a calculation of unemployment including military personnel
based in the United States, the department said joblessness also
rose by 0.3 percentage points, from 4.9 percent to 5.2 percent.

<HEAD>SEC Affirms Action Against Churner Of Widow's Account</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission said
Friday it has affirmed the censure and fining of a Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. broker accused of dissipating a 70-year-old widow's
$100,000 insurance settlement.
   The widow, identified in SEC documents only as Mrs. G, received
a $100,000 insurance settlement when her son, Michael, died of
cancer and deposited the money in October 1982 with Ronald L.
Salyer, a broker in the firm's Washington, D.C., office.
   According to the agency, Salyer ``churned'' the account, making
83 trades totaling $2.22 million. In only 13 months, commissions
and margin account interest had consumed $54,081 of the money.
   The SEC, in the ruling, upheld a finding by the National
Association of Securities Dealers, which censured Salyer and the
manager of his branch office, Randolph G. Peyton, and fined both
$3,000. The document noted that earlier Salyer had settled Mrs. G's
claim for $41,000.
   The SEC faulted Peyton and the firm for failing to more closely
supervise Salyer and agreed with the NASD that the penalty levied
was mild.
   Salyer, according to the document, maintained that Mrs. G gave
him full authorization to manage her account aggressively and had
said she did not need the money to live on.

   A jury has awarded $185,000 to a man who
was handcuffed at work and jailed after Alamo Rent A Car agreed to
extend his rental but then accused him of not returning the car on

   An Orange County jury agreed Thursday that Alamo maliciously
prosecuted Howard Lee by falsely accusing him of keeping the rental
car and then having him arrested.
   The jury awarded the electrical contractor $80,000 in
compensatory damages for loss of reputation and $105,000 in
punitive damages.
   Although Lee said he was satisfied with the verdict, he said he
still hurts inside as a result of the cold shoulders he got from
friends after being handcuffed on the job and jailed briefly in
1986.
   Liz Clark, spokeswoman at Alamo's corporate headquarters in Fort

<HEAD>Ads Pulled From CBS Stations in Support of Apple Industry</HEAD>

<DATELINE>YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a show of solidarity with troubled apple
growers, the Washington State Fruit Commission on Friday decided to
pull $71,000 worth of television advertising for Northwest cherries
from CBS affiliates in St. Louis, Atlanta and Tampa, Fla.
   The action is a protest against the CBS television show ``60
Minutes,'' which apple growers feel damaged their industry with a
recent report on the chemical Alar.
   The move came as apple sales continued to rebound, climbing 9
percent in the past week, according to the latest industry report,
released Friday.
   ``Our association wanted to voice its displeasure over the way
the CBS broadcast of the `60 Minutes' program chose to
sensationalize the Alar story,'' commission spokesman Pat Dunlop
said.
   The television ads were part of a $900,000 promotion of
Northwest cherries the directors of the marketing and promotion
group approved Thursday.
   Roy Brunett, a ``60 Minutes'' spokesman in New York, declined
comment on the action because it does not directly involve the
network.
   Alar is not used on cherries, but many of group's members grow
both crops and ``we're trying to take a united stance on this
issue,'' Dunlop said.
   Atlanta, St. Louis and Tampa had been targeted for extensive
television advertising because sales of Northwest cherries in those
areas are below the national average, Dunlop said.
   The $71,300 budgeted for advertising buys on the CBS affiliates
in those three cities will instead be spent on advertising on other
television stations there, said Dennis Miller of the Evans-Kraft
advertising agency in Seattle, which handles the commission's
accounts.
   On Feb. 26, ``60 Minutes'' ran an exclusive account of a Natural
Resources Defense Council report on pesticides in children's food.
The study concluded that eating apples treated with Alar increased
cancer risks in children.
   The report findings have been disputed by the apple industry and
federal regulators have declared apples safe to eat.
   But the NRDC report sent apple sales into a tailspin, and
growers contend they have lost millions of dollars as a result.
   Washington grows half the nation's apples, and nearly all the
domestic production this late in the season. The industry still has
16.8 million 42-pound boxes in storage that must be sold before the
next harvest in the fall.
   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has said it plans to
ban Alar next year, based on preliminary studies, but the chemical
is still legal to use.

   The stock market finished mixed Friday, giving
up a strong early gain in an erratic response to new evidence of
slowing economic growth.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up more than 20 points
in early trading, closed with a 2.94 loss at 2,381.96.
   That left the average with a loss of 36.84 points for the week.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
820 up, 603 down and 539 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 180.81 million
shares, up from 153.13 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 212.39 million shares.
   The Labor Department reported Friday morning that the civilian
unemployment rate took an unexpected 0.3 percentage point jump in
April, to 5.3 percent.
   The monthly data also showed an increase of 117,000 in nonfarm
payroll employment, substantially less than most advance estimates
on Wall Street.
   The figures reinforced the spreading belief on Wall Street that
the economy has been slowing in recent months, responding to
credit-tightening by the Federal Reserve.
   What remains less clear, analysts said, is whether the Fed is
starting to see any results in its primary mission of reining in
inflation.
   In addition, brokers said, some investors apparently began to
worry about what a slowing economy would mean for corporate profits.
   Losers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, down 1\ at 109]; Exxon, down [ at 42\; DuPont, down 1 at

   The dollar spurted higher in worldwide trading
Friday despite waves of concerted central bank intervention and the
government's report of higher U.S. unemployment during April.
   ``The dollar still seems to be king,'' said Jack Barbanel,
senior vice president at Gruntal &amp; Co.
   Early in the session, the U.S. currency fell sharply on the
Labor Department's report indicating the jobless rate had climbed
to 5.3 percent in April from 5.0 percent the previous month. But
the currency's recovery was quick and dramatic.
   As the currency pushed against the level of 1.90 West German
marks, the Federal Reserve, joined by West Germany's Bundesbank and
other European central banks, began the first in a series of rounds
of dollar-selling.
   Traders noted that the intervention, though frequent, was
moderate in volume. They interpreted that as a sign the Fed only
intended to slow the dollar's rise, rather than completly curtail
it.
   ``Consistently strong buying took the dollar back through the
intervention levels,'' said Jim McGroarty senior vice president of
Greenwich Capital Markets Inc. in Greenwich, Conn. ``What the day
showed is that there is a consistent strong demand for dollars for
investment in the U.S., be it in the stock or bond market,'' he
said.
   While the unemployment report was consistent with recent
statistics showing slower economic activity, observers note that
interest rates in the United States do not appear to be easing.
   High U.S. interest rates have boosted demand for dollars and
dollar-denominated investments.
   The Fed would like to keep the dollar from rising too far _
which would make U.S. goods more expensive overseas _ in order to
help ease the U.S. trade deficit.
   ``As long as the dollar still is a high-yielding currency,
you're going to see it maintain pretty good strength,'' Barbanel
said, adding that only a severe economic slowdown or a swelling
trade deficit are likely to stifle demand for the U.S. currency.
   The Tokyo market was closed for Children's Day, a national
holiday. In London, the dollar was quoted at 134.31 yen, compared
with 133.95 yen late Thursday. In New York, the dollar rose to
134.25 yen from 134.20 yen Thursday.
   In London, the British pound dipped to $1.6740 from $1.6841
Thursday. In New York sterling fell to $1.6755 from Thursday's
$1.6813.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with rates late
Thursday, included: 1.8977 West German marks, up from 1.8958;
1.6963 Swiss francs, up from 1.6911; 6.4020 French francs, up from
6.4005; 1,384.63 Italian lire, up from 1,380.00; and 1.1842
Canadian dollars, up from 1.1831.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with rates late
Thursday, included: 1.8988 West German marks, up from 1.8915;
1.6985 Swiss francs, up from 1.6860; 6.4080 French francs, up from
6.3875; 2.1285 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1290; 1,379.00 Italian
lire, down from 1,380.00; and 1.1842 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1841.
   Gold prices were little changed in U.S. trading after falling
overseas. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a troy ounce of
gold bullion at $377.00 as of 4 p.m. EDT, up 30 cents from
Thursday's late bid.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery
settled at $377.70 a troy ounce, unchanged from Thursday.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid of $376.25 a troy ounce from
$378.25 late Thursday. In Zurich, gold fell to close at a bid of
$375.85 from $379 bid late Wednesday. The market was closed
Thursday. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell 75 cents to close at
$378.41.
   Silver bullion for current delivery closed on New York's Comex
at $5.598 a troy ounce, down from Thursday's settlement of $5.613.
Earlier in London, silver was trading at a late bid of $5.60 a troy
ounce, compared with Thursday's $5.66.

<UNK>Pittston Announces First Dividends In Six Years</UNK>
<DATELINE>GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pittston Co. announced its first
dividends in six years Friday, but a spokesman said the decision
wasn't a response to striking coal miners who have recently raised
doubts about the company's finances.
   ``This had been talked about in the annual report and talked
about by analysts,'' said William J. Byrne Jr., a Pittston
spokesman. ``People can read into these things what they want.''
   Members of the United Mine Workers had questioned the company's
failure to pay dividends since 1983 as part of a union strategy to
take its disputes with the company directly to shareholders. The
union also has three proposals on the company's proxy ballot that
will be voted during Pittston's annual meeting Wednesday.
   Officials at the union headquarters in Washington, D.C., weren't
available Friday for comment on the payment of dividends, according
to a secretary reached by telephone.
   Pittston's board of directors, meeting in Greenwich, agreed to
pay a 5-cent dividend on each share on June 1 to all stockholders
of record as of May 16. Rumors about the dividend had caused a
50-cent rise in the company's stock Thursday, to $19.50 a share on
the New York Stock Exchange.
   In addition to announcing the dividend, the company's directors
approved a plan that will allow the company to repurchase up to 3
million of its common shares. Since July 1986, Pittston has bought
5.2 million of its shares at a cost of $66.5 million, or about
$12.65 a share.
   The company will purchase the shares from time to time as
conditions warrant, Byrne said.
   ``It's the kind of program that Wall Street expects you to do.
We believe our stock is undervalued,'' Byrne said.
   About 1,500 miners in Virginia and West Virgina went on strike
against the company on April 5 in a dispute over wages and
benefits. Two hundred other miners at the company's operations in
Kentucky have remained on the job.
   Representatives of the miners' union have formed the so-called
Pittston Independent Shareholders Committee, which owns 1,721 of
the company's 37.8 million shares outstanding.
   Pittston is a diversified company with interests in coal mining,
home security, security transportation services and air freight
services.

<HEAD>Rise in Jobless Rate Drops Precious Metal Prices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Precious metal futures prices dropped Friday in dull trading on
New York's Commodities Exchange in the wake of news that the
nation's unemployment rate shot up 0.3 percent to 5.3 percent in
April.
   On other markets, grain and soybean prices were up, livestock
and meat prices were mixed, and oil prices were down.
   Gold settled $1.20 to 30 cents lower with the contract for
delivery in June at $379.60 a troy ounce; silver was 1.5 cents to
3.9 cents lower with May at $5.598 a troy ounce.
   ``There was more weakness in the economy than expected,'' said
Stephen W. Platt, an analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in
Chicago. ``Initial selling was on the belief that the unemployment
news would temper a surge in inflation.'' Inflation increases the
desirability of investment in gold and silver.
   Platt also attributed the selloff to the strong dollar.
   Gold futures were able to recover most of their losses in late
trading as investors began to believe the market was oversold.
   Silver, which was trading within a 6-cent range, was also able
to attract some support late.
   ``Metals have been hit by lack of participation,'' Platt said,
adding that with the bad market and adequate supplies, there is not
a rush to buy.
   Grain and soybean futures prices were higher in quiet trading on
the Chicago Board of Trade as expectations of additional export of
U.S. grains spurred the market.
   Earlier this week, the United States offered to sell 1.5 million
metric tons of grain to the Soviet Union under the export subsidy
program.
   The Soviets have announced a bid for 300,000 metric tons of
wheat, leaving about 1.2 million metric tons available to them.
   ``I think even if they are not bidding now, they will be in the
market in the near future,'' said Ted Mao, a grain specialist for
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York. ``That is keeping wheat
prices firm.''
   Expected Soviet demand for U.S. corn also spurred prices for
that commodity.
   ``The Soviets have made sporadic buys of corn in the past,'' Mao
said. ``The market is waiting to hear how much more buying will be
done.''
   Soybean futures rose on word of tightness in the U.S. and
Brazilian cash soybean markets.
   Wheat was 1{ cents to 3 cents higher with May at $4.37 a bushel;
corn was 1} cents to 4} cents higher with May at $2.80{ a bushel;
oats were 3{ cents to 6\ cents higher with May at $1.96} a bushel;
soybeans were 1 cent to 9{ cents higher with May at $7.59{ a bushel.
   Energy futures declined in light trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange on expectations of a surplus of gasoline.
   ``Crude oil took a beating because of the weakness in
gasoline,'' said Andrew Lebow, an analyst with E.D. &amp; F Man
International Futures Inc. in New York.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 21 cents to 56 cents lower
with June at $20.02 cents a barrel; heating oil was .95 cent to
7.74 cents lower with June at 40.85 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .55 cent to 2.12 cents lower with June at 67.50 cents
a gallon.
   Live cattle prices were mixed and pork futures slightly higher
in light trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   The drop in cattle futures were limited by expected stronger
cash prices in coming weeks and strong boxed meat purchases by
retailers, said analyst Tom O'Hare of Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp;
Co. in New York.
   Hog prices were helped by an anticipated decline in marketings
next week. But futures were weighed down by weak cash prices at the
wholesale level.
   Live cattle were .15 cent lower to .20 cent higher with June at
72.42 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .07 cent lower to .07 cent
higher with May at 76.97 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent lower to
.17 cent higher with June at 47.27 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .37 cent lower to .13 cent higher with May at 30.95
cents a pound.

<TEXT>
   California's state employee pension fund, the
nation's biggest, said Friday it might back an attempt by other
major Exxon Corp. shareholders to pressure the company to better
prepare for future environmental disasters in the wake of its
Alaskan oil spill.
   A spokesman for the California Public Employee Retirement
System, which owns 8 million shares amounting to about 0.6 percent
of Exxon's outstanding common stock, said the fund may back New
York City's plan to use its holdings in an effort to advocate the
company change its spill strategies.
   ``We are looking very closely at what New York City is doing,''
said James Burton, deputy comptroller for the state of California
``... If they are able to reach an agreement with Exxon that would
address our concerns we would endorse that.''
   New York officials said Thursday after meeting with Exxon
executives that three city pension funds owning 6 million shares of
Exxon stock would vote against company management at the May 18
annual meeting of shareholders if Exxon failed to act on the
group's recommendations.
   Among other requests, the group is asking for the formation of a
subcommittee of the board to handle environmental matters as well
as for a new contingency plan to deal with future disasters.
   Alaska officials and environmentalists have criticized Exxon for
what they consider its slow response to the March 24 spill, which
has fouled hundreds of miles of waters and coastline.
   New York City's employee, firefighter and police funds together
own Exxon stock amounting to less than 1 percent of the company's
1.33 billion outstanding common shares.
   About 35 percent of Exxon's shares are owned by institutional
investors. The company has some 713,000 shareholders.
   Burton said all pension funds with large holdings of Exxon stock
are worried that the spill would have financial consequences for
the company. California investors are particularly concerned about
the ``inadequate state of preparedness'' by Exxon, he said.
   ``We're concerned about its management. Management has made
statements in the past, representations that they are capable of
handling oil spills,'' Burton said. ``It appears that they were in
fact not prepared and that their representations are not accurate.''
   Burton said that if California decides to take a position for or
against Exxon management, the California State Teachers Retirement
Fund, which holds 5.5 million Exxon shares, also would be included.
California comptroller Gray Davis is the trustee for both funds,
owning 13.5 million Exxon shares, or about 1.01 percent of the
outstanding common.
   Separately, a spokesman for New York State's Employee Retirement
Fund indicated it was considering its own course of action. Tom
Pandick, director of investor affairs for the state, said the
pension fund does not normally send an official representative to
Exxon annual meetings but would do so this year.
   A spokesman for New York City Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin
said Goldin has been talking with the executive director of the
Council of Institutional Investors, which represents 65 large
pension funds with $300 billion in assets.
   ``We have indications of interest of 22 million shares from
other pension funds,'' said Steven Cohen, deputy counsel for the
comptroller. Cohen said all of the pension funds are members of the
Council.
   Alaska pension fund officials said earlier this week they would
withhold votes on their 650,600 shares at this year's meeting as a
symbolic gesture to underscore the state's concern about the spill.

   Oil futures prices declined in light trading
Friday on a wave of profit-taking after gains earlier in the week.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the June contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, closed at
$20.02 a barrel, 56 cents lower than Thursday's session. The
contract traded as low as $19.99 but rose shortly before the close,
traders said.
   Other crude contracts also closed the day lower.
   Among refined products, unleaded gasoline for June delivery fell
2.12 cents to 67.50 cents a gallon, while June heating oil declined
1.22 cents to settle at 47.37 cents a gallon. All other contract
months were down, but less sharply.
   Prices surged late Wednesday and Thursday after an announcement
that repairs on a North Sea oil platform would take longer than
expected. Brent crude production may be disrupted until the end of
May, officials said.
   Friday's decline reflected concern that the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries has increased production and might
boost its quota in the second half of the year, traders said.

   A year after Armstrong Tire Co. was
acquired by the Italian tiremaker Pirelli, several dozen employees
of the new Pirelli Armstrong Tire Corp. are going the extra mile
and studying the mother tongue of their mother company.
   Treading where they haven't been in years _ the classroom _ the
new Italian language students range from vice presidents to
engineers.
   Some of the employees are spending extra time at work to take
classes being offered in the cafeteria of the company's
headquarters. Others, including some vice presidents, are being
trained by tutors who come to their offices or are taking college
courses.
   In the hallways of the company's headquarters, and out on the
building's grounds, it is not uncommon to hear employees practicing
their new language skills.
   Pirelli Armstrong officials say it was their idea to start the
program, and that participation in the crash-language courses has
been strictly voluntary.
   ``It's our way of saying we like being part of the Pirelli
organization,'' said Jan Colella, employee relations manager at
Pirelli Armstrong.
   ``It was our idea. They (executives in Italy) said slow down,
you don't have to learn so fast,'' she said.
   While most of the people from the Pirelli Group in Milan, Italy,
speak English, not all do so well, ``so it is helpful if we can
meet each other halfway sometimes,'' Collella said.
   About 15 employees have finished a beginner's class and have
moved on to the next level of instruction. Meanwhile, a second
beginner's class has also started. The classes are held two days a
week, from 4 to 6 p.m., so that the employees are taught partly on
their own time and partly on the company's. The work day ends at 5
p.m.
   Collella said her office drew up a list of employees, from the
300 who work at the headquarters, who might find knowledge of
Italian useful either because of contacts they will be making with
Italians or because of materials they must read.
   When the employees were approached about taking lessons, ``we
didn't have anyone say `No,'' she said. ``We got a very positive
response.''
   At least seven management-level employees are learning Italian
through the Berlitz method, including William Bruce, who is a vice
president and corporate counsel.
   ``It's tough to go back to school after all these years,'' said
Bruce, who is 37. It's even tougher, he said, to find the time for
visits by a tutor and for studying.
   ``I'm not entirely satisfied with my progress at this point,''
he said. ``I can read it better than I can speak it.''
   A tutor has visited Bruce's office at least a couple dozen
times, but some weeks he has had to skip lessons, he said. He also
has instructional tapes to play in his car, but he said, ``I can't
say I've listened to them as religiously as I should.''
   Bruce said there has been absolutely no attempt by executives in
Milan to pressure their American employees into learning Italian.
``The opposite happened,'' he said. ``When I was over there, they
said, `Why are you learning it?'''
   ``They seemed to be pleased by it,'' he said.
   Bruce said he has found even his beginner's knowledge of Italian
very useful on visiting Milan, and that he would like to attain a
reasonable degree of fluency ``so I can communicate in a basic
business conversation.''
   ``It's fun. It's different,'' Bruce said.

<HEAD>Prices Spurt on Unemployment Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices closed moderately higher Friday
after an unexpectedly weak employment report gave investors hope
that the Federal Reserve might loosen the reins on interest rates.
   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond rose ] point, or $3.75
per $1,000 face amount. Its yield, which moves in an opposite
direction from price, fell to 8.95 percent from 8.99 percent late
Thursday.
   Bonds rallied after the Labor Department reported non-farm
business payrolls expanded by only 117,000 jobs in April, the
weakest showing since a drop of 92,000 jobs in June 1986.
   The department also reported that last month's unemployment rate
rose to 5.3 percent from 5 percent in March and reached its highest
level since January.
   Mitchell Held, chief financial economist with Smith Barney,
Harris Upham &amp; Co., said the increase was smaller than expected and
fueled the market's hopes that the Fed would relax credit in
response to an apparent cooling of the economy.
   If the Fed eases credit, interest rates would likely fall while
bond prices would rise.
   The employment report said hourly earnings rose a seasonally
adjusted 0.7 percent in April after climbing 0.3 percent a month
for two months, but Held said the rise, which could have ignited
fears of higher inflation and a resulting tightening of credit, was
not enough to offset the non-farm payroll drop.
   However, Held said, trading was restrained in advance of the
Treasury's quarterly refunding auction, scheduled for next week.
   In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of
short-term governments rose 7-32 point to 5-16 point, intermediate
maturities were up about ] point and long-term issues were 7-16
point higher, according to Telerate Inc., the financial information
service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, jumped up by 4.67 to 1,137.47.
   In corporate trading, industrials also gained. Moody's
Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures total return
on a portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years
or longer, rose 1.72 to 306.20.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 8.73 percent as the
discount slid 9 basis points to 8.44 percent. Yields on six-month
bills fell to 8.87 percent as the discount declined 9 basis points
to 8.39 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to 8.96 percent as
the discount went down 14 basis points to 8.29 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, traded at 913-16, compared to 9~ percent late Thursday.

<HEAD>Signs of Slower Economic Growth Spark Erratic Market Reactions</HEAD>
<HEAD>By The Associated Press</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A jump in April's unemployment rate and weaker job creation
implied economic growth has slowed, but the government report
Friday provoked inconsistent reactions from financial markets.
   The Labor Department said the civilian unemployment rate climbed
to 5.3 percent from 5 percent in March.
   As for job growth last month, a survey of businesses found only
117,000 non-farm payroll positions were created, the smallest
monthly addition in 3 years.
   Economists said the unexpectedly weak employment news offered
the most convincing evidence yet of slower activity and said this
may keep the Federal Reserve Board from tightening credit any
further when it reevaluates monetary policy in two weeks.
   Some analysts said the central bank might even decide to become
more generous with credit, causing interest rates to decline.
   At first, Wall Street greeted the report with an enthusiastic
rally, pushing the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials more than 20
points higher.
   After awhile, though, investors started worrying that a
significant reduction in business activity could squeeze corporate
profits. Plus, the Fed might not have the leeway to loosen its
credit clamp because inflationary pressures don't seem to have
abated much.
   These worries and sales to collect profits left the Dow Jones
average with a loss on the day of 2.94 at 2,381.96. For the week,
the key market measure shed 36.84 points.
   Overall, stocks had a mixed day. Advancing issues outnumbered
declines by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading of New York Stock
Exchange-listed stocks, with 820 up, 603 down and 539 unchanged.
   Meanwhile, the dollar continued to flex its muscle, ignoring the
economic evidence and defying concerted attempts by central banks
to check its advance.
   Usually, weak U.S. economic statistics tend to depress the
dollar's value against other major currencies.
   Foreign exchange dealers said as the currency pushed against the
level of 1.90 West German marks, the Fed, joined by West Germany's
Bundesbank and other European central banks, began the first in a
series of dollar sales.
   The intervention, though frequent, was moderate in volume.
Dealers interpreted that as a sign the Fed only intended to slow
the dollar's rise, rather than completely curtail it. At the end of
New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.8977 West German
marks, up from 1.8958 on Thursday.
   In the credit markets, bond prices closed moderately higher,
relinquishing the earlier gains that came soon after the
unemployment report was issued.
   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond rose ] point, or $3.75
per $1,000 face amount. Its yield, which moves in an opposite
direction from price, fell to 8.95 percent from 8.99 percent late
Thursday.

   Two senior stock traders at Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. were asked to resign Friday for violating the
investment company's policies, a Prudential-Bache spokeswoman said.
   She said the two have submitted their resignations.
   Prudential-Bache declined to identify the individuals or provide
details of the violations said to have been discovered during an
internal investigation of trading activities.
   Company investigators noticed irregularities which were
``inconsistent with firm policy'' in accounts handled by the two
traders, the Pru-Bache spokeswoman said. The accounts involved were
Prudential-Bache company accounts, not ones containing clients'
money, she said.
   A Wall Street source said the two traders were Dan Marciano,
head of Pru-Bache's equity trading desk, and William Grace, a block
trader, meaning a specialist in transactions comprising large
quantities of shares.
   Marciano had been head of equity trading for three years and had
been with Prudential-Bache since 1984. Information about Grace's
employment history at Prudential-Bache was not immediately
available.
   Prudential-Bache stated it gave a full report of the trading
improprieties to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Lawrence Iason, the SEC's New York regional administrator, said
he could not comment on whether the regulatory agency had received
a report from Prudential-Bache. Law prohibits the SEC from
disclosing whether it is conducting an investigation.

<TEXT>
   Takeover strategist Carl C. Icahn has signaled
his interest in buying strikebound Eastern Airlines' Philadelphia
airport hub, an Icahn associate said late Friday.
   Icahn filed documents with the federal bankruptcy court Friday
expressing his interest in the hub without specifying the price
he'd be willing to pay, Trans World Airlines General Counsel Mark
Buckstein told The Associated Press. Icahn, who publicly expressed
interest in all of Eastern some time ago but hasn't formally
bidded, is the owner and chairman of TWA.
   On Thursday, the state of Pennsylvania filed a challenge to
USAir Group Inc.'s proposed purchase of eight Eastern gates at
Philadelphia airport, saying the transaction could lead to higher
ticket prices in Pennsylvania.
   The sale, worth about $85 million to Eastern, would give USAir
23 of the 49 gates at the airport. TWA only has four gates there
currently, Buckstein said.
   Icahn also filed Friday with the Securities and Exchange
Commission for permission to sell $300 million in 5-year notes,
with the proceeds to be used for working capital and possible
acquisitions. Buckstein said the notes aren't specifically intended
to raise money to buy Eastern.
   Separately, Eastern said former airline executive William
Howard, who is spearheading a group interested in buying Eastern,
has met with officials of the ailing carrier.
   Howard, who has joined with investment firm Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. in formulating a possible bid for Eastern, met
Thursday with executives of the airline at its Miami headquarters,
Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said. He declined to disclose
details or identify the Eastern officialsinvolved.
   Howard is a former senior vice president of Eastern and was
chairman of Piedmont Airlines until it was acquired by USAir Group
Inc. in 1987. The Howard group also met recently with officials of
Eastern's unions and the committee representing its major creditors.
   Attempts to reach Howard by phone in Miami and at his home
Friday were unsuccessful.
   Matell reiterated the company's position that Eastern was not
for sale and was proceeding with its recently announced plan to
rebuild as a smaller carrier and raise some $1.8 billion by selling
aircraft and other assets.
   ``We're committed to the rebuilding plan as the most sensible
course,'' he said.
   The Eastern officials gave Howard information as requested by
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland, Matell said. At a hearing
on Wednesday, the judge requested that the Howard group be given
confidential financial data on Eastern which is to be provided to
all serious bidders for the airline.
   Billionaire hotel executive Jay Pritzker, who formally submitted
an offer for Eastern last week, already has received the
information. So has Icahn, according to his general counsel.
   ``We're going to have a lot of people reading a lot of pieces of
paper over the weekend,'' Buckstein said.
   
   Eastern has been in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from
creditors since March 9, five days after the start of a strike by
the Machinists union that was supported by pilots and flight
attendants, virtually grounding the airline.
   Lifland has set next Wednesday as a deadline for all interested
bidders to submit their offers to the court, which must approve any
sales of Eastern assets.
   A source close to the situation said the Howard group would have
a formal offer ready by the May 10 deadline.
   Attorney Lewis Kaden, who represents the Howard group, has
declined to give specifics of the proposal but said it would
include Eastern's Northeast shuttle service, slated to be sold to
developer Donald Trump for $365 million. America West Airlines, an
aggressive regional carrier, on Wednesday offered $726 million for
the shuttle routes and landing slots, along with 10 Boeing 757
jetliners.
   Lifland has set a hearing for next Friday over the Trump shuttle
deal.
   As part of its offer, the Howard group plans to propose a
bankruptcy reorganization plan for Eastern, Kaden said. He did not
return phone calls seeking comment on the meeting with Eastern
officials.

<HEAD>Time, Warner Ask Court To Resolve Dispute With Chris-Craft</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Time Inc. and Warner Communications Inc.,
seeking to complete their planned $15 billion merger, asked a
Delaware court Friday to resolve a dispute with Chris-Craft
Industries Inc. over the disposition of Chris-Craft's shares of
Warner stock.
   Time and Warner said in a statement they disagreed with
Chris-Craft, Warner's largest shareholder, over the terms of an
agreement between Chris-Craft, Warner and BHC Inc., a Chris-Craft
subsidiary.
   The 1986 agreement was intended to cover the disposition of
Chris-Craft's stake in Warner and also the disposition of BHC
shares held by Warner.
   Despite the disagreement, Time and Warner said they were willing
to accept Chris-Craft's interpretation ``in order to put this issue
behind us once and for all.''
   The two companies asked the court in Delaware _ where all three
companies are incorporated _ to issue a declaration that would
determine the rights of the parties and allow the merger to proceed.
   ``Our complaint seeks to compel Chris-Craft and BHC to choose an
arrangement as dictated by the terms of the existing agreement and
to avoid any effort by Chris-Craft to delay or otherwise interfere
with the merger,'' Time and Warner said in a statement.
   Chris-Craft became Warner's largest stockholder in 1984 after
helping Warner Chairman Steven Ross fight an unwanted takeover bid
from publisher Rupert Murdoch. However, Ross and Chris-Craft
Chairman Herbert Siegel have been at loggerheads ever since,
quarreling over a number of issues.
   Siegel did not comment publicly after Time and Warner announced
plans to form Time Warner Inc., the world's largest media concern.
The combined stock market value of the two companies at the time of
the announcement was about $15 billion.
   Media industry analysts had expected the Chris-Craft chairman to
raise some objection to the proposed merger.
   Chris-Craft did not immediately return a reporter's phone call
seeking comment on the statements by Time and Warner.

<TEXT>
   The Machinists union at Northwest Airlines
has told the carrier's parent it plans to mount its own bid to buy
the airline holding company, union sources said Friday.
   The International Association of Machinists District Lodge 143,
Northwest's largest union, made the proposal in a letter to the
board of directors of NWA Inc., Northwest's parent, the sources
told The Associated Press.
   NWA is believed to be the target of several suitors, including
two to four that NWA Chairman Steven Rothmeier said last week are
friendly. Billionaire oilman Marvin Davis has made the only formal
bid, a $2.7 billion, $90-a-share offer that he this week switched
from a hostile to a friendly effort.
   NWA said it filed an amended document Thursday with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, stating that it plans to
provide additional confidential information and access to an
unspecified number of interested parties.
   NWA also said it plans on May 12 to distribute certificates
representing preferred stock purchase rights under the
corporation's ``poison pill'' shareholder rights plan to holders of
NWA common stock as of the close of business May 4.
   Kevin Whalen, a Northwest spokesman, confirmed receipt of the
letter but said he hadn't seen it and couldn't describe its
contents.
   ``We're going to study the letter before we have a response to
it,'' Whalen said. ``We haven't digested all the things in it.''
   The letter said the union was ``determined to explore initiation
of our own program as an alternative'' to other bids for NWA, said
the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The Machinists union represents about 21,500 mechanics, baggage
handlers and other employees at Northwest.
   The letter said the union's proposal is at a preliminary stage.
However, it outlined several elements likely to be included in its
bid:
   _It would avoid the heavy debt burden typical of leveraged
buyouts.
   _It would reduce labor costs while increasing NWA's business and
still not ``adversely affect the compensation'' of individual
employees.
   _It would involve a substantial employee stake in NWA.
   _It would put a block of NWA stock in the hands of a ``patient
investor'' acceptable to employees, as opposed to a speculator
interested in short-term gain.
   Meanwhile, NWA stock, which shot to record highs Thursday on
signs that potential suitors were preparing for a bidding war, rose
even higher Friday. The stock closed at $105[ a share, up ] on the
New York Stock Exchange.
   Bankers Trust Corp. of New York confirmed Thursday that it was
working on a proposal with Los Angeles investor Al Checchi, who
leads a group holding 4.9 percent of NWA stock. Bankers Trust
Senior Vice President Thomas Parisi said the firm is prepared to
advise Checchi and arrange financing, including an equity stake of
its own. Parisi said details of a financing package have yet to be
arranged.
   Mike Hamilton, a financial analyst with Piper, Jaffray &amp;
Hopwood, said stock traders also were intrigued by signs that
another apparent suitor may be preparing an offer. The company,
leveraged buyout specialist Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.,
reportedly has affiliated with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., and
apparently sold a large block of stock Wednesday in
Cincinnati-based Kroger Co., netting a $19 million profit.
   In another development Thursday, NWA Chairman Steve Rothmeier
and the leaders of Northwest's 5,000-member pilots union said the
unsettled labor contract covering the pilots remains a major wild
card in the takeover battle.
   Pete Dodge and Kirk Faupel, officials of the Air Line Pilots
Association, also confirmed that they had been approached by four
potential suitors: Checchi; Davis, who started the bidding March
30; Kelso &amp; Co., a New York investment firm; and Wesray Capital
Corp., an investment firm founded by former treasury secretary
William Simon.
   But they said all four broke off contact after NWA announced its
ground rules.
   In a separate interview, Rothmeier reiterated that the open
labor contract is scaring off friendly bidders who don't want to
buy or invest in an airline with excessive wage costs or labor
trouble.
   The company and the pilots continued their contract talks
Friday, according to another ALPA spokesman, Jim Halvorson, who
said he had no immediate word on whether progress had been made.
