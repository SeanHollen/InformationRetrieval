   Share prices opened firmer Wednesday on reports
that Chinese troops responsible for the slaughter of pro-democracy
demonstrators were leaving Beijing.
   Brokers said trading was active, but investors remained cautious
awaiting further developments.
   The Hang Seng Index of blue chips, which plummeted on Monday to
its worst loss since the worldwide market collapse in 1987, gained
about 140 points to 2,289 within the first hour of trading.
   Before the morning session, members of the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange stood for three minutes of silence tribute to victims of
the military attack Sunday, in which hundreds and perhaps thousands
were killed.
   On Monday, the index closed at 2,093.61 points, down 581.77
points from Friday. The drop was the worst since the 1987
international market collapse, when the index fell 1,120.99 points.

<HEAD>`Indiana Jones' Continues to Smash Box-Office Records</HEAD>

   Hulk Hogan may be unbeatable in the wrestling
ring, but he's clearly no match for Indiana Jones.
   Hogan's new movie ``No Holds Barred'' was body slammed by
``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,'' which continued to break
box-office records by collecting another $21.2 million at the
nation's theaters over the weekend.
   According to figures released Monday by Exhibitor Relations Co.,
``No Holds Barred'' gathered $5 million in its first weekend of
release.
   ``The Last Crusade,'' which set four major box-office marks in
its first week of release, broke two more records in its second
week and took in as much as the next six most popular movies
combined.
   The film, in which Harrison Ford as the dauntless archaeologist
joins his father (Sean Connery) to save the Holy Grail from the
Nazis, set new records for the best 12 days and best second weekend
in movie history. It could pass the $100 million mark next weekend
and shatter yet another record.
   ``No Holds Barred,'' a new action-adventure film featuring
wrestler Hogan, debuted in second place. ``See No Evil, Hear No
Evil,'' a crime comedy with Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor, landed
in third on ticket sales of $4.1 million.
   In fourth was the Kevin Costner baseball movie ``Field of
Dreams'' on gross of $3.7 million. It was followed by
``Renegades,'' starring Kiefer Sutherland and Lou Diamond Phillips,
opening in fifth with $3.1 million. ``Road House,'' featuring
Patrick Swayze as a bar bouncer, placed sixth with $3 million.
   Continuing its sluggish pace, Clint Eastwood's ``Pink Cadillac''
collected only $2.5 million to land in seventh place. ``K-9,''
starring Jim Belushi and a dog as a police team, finished in eighth
with $1.8 million.
   Rounding out the Top 10 were ``Pet Sematary,'' in ninth on gross
of $1.7 million, and ``Major League,'' in 10th with $963,636.
``Rain Man,'' a Top 10 movie for all of 1989, finally fell off the
leader board.
   Robin Williams' ``Dead Poets Society,'' playing on only eight
screens, collected a lively $340,456. Its per screen average _
$42,557 _ was the third best in the history of limited releases, in
which a movie opens in just a handful of theaters.
   The only films to surpass ``Dead Poets Society'' in a limited
release opening were ``Good Morning, Vietnam'' and ``The Last
Temptation of Christ.''
   Here are the top movies for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor
Relations, with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater
screens, average per screen, total gross and number of weeks in
release.
   1. ``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,'' Paramount, $21.2
million, 2,327 screens, $9,123 per screen, $77.1 million, two weeks.
   2. ``No Holds Barred,'' New Line, $5 million, 1,318 screens,
$3,761 per screen, $5 million, one week.
   3. ``See No Evil, Hear No Evil,'' Tri-Star, $4.1 million, 1,680
screens, $2,415 per screen, $28.9 million, four weeks.
   4. ``Field of Dreams,'' Universal, $3.7 million, 1,100 screens,
$3,400 per screen, $35.6 million, seven weeks.
   5. ``Renegades,'' Universal, $3.1 million, 1,627 screens, $1,890
per screen, $3.1 million, one week.
   6. ``Road House,'' MGM-UA, $3 million, 1,880 screens, $1,599 per
screen, $17.5 million, three weeks.
   7. ``Pink Cadillac,'' Warner Bros., $2.5 million, 1,993 screens,
$1,250 per screen, $7.8 million, two weeks.
   8. ``K-9,'' Universal, $1.8 million, 1,307 screens, $1,410 per
screen, $33 million, six weeks.
   9. ``Pet Sematary,'' Paramount, $1.7 million, 1,248 screens,
$1,370 per screen, $48.4 million, seven weeks.
   10. ``Major League,'' Paramount, $963,636 million, 960 screens,

<HEAD>Blood Test May Indicate Death Risk in High Blood Pressure, Study
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A standard test of kidney functioning may signal
a higher risk of dying within eight years in people with high blood
pressure, including death from heart attack or stroke, a new study
suggests.
   The blood test is for a muscle byproduct called creatinine, and
it is not clear why the substance would have anything to do with
heart attack or stroke, said study co-author Neil Shulman.
   But he said his work suggests that people with high creatinine
levels and high blood pressure should pay extra attention to
reducing smoking, cutting cholesterol and taking other steps to
reduce their risk of heart attack and stroke.
   ``It's sort of like a flashing light saying, `I'm in a high-risk
group, I better pay attention,''' he said Monday in a telephone
interview.
   Shulman, associate professor of medicine at Emory University
School of Medicine in Atlanta, and colleagues from several medical
schools present the work in the May issue of the journal
Hypertension.
   The study included 10,768 people with high blood pressure. It
found that those with high levels of creatinine in their blood
showed higher death rates from heart attack and stroke, as well as
kidney disease, researchers said.
   Creatinine is a waste product produced by muscle tissue. Kidneys
normally remove it from blood, so high levels of creatinine
remaining in the blood can signal kidney trouble. A normal
creatinine reading is usually considered to be 0.7 to 1.5
milligrams per deciliter, Shulman said.
   The new study found that people with a reading of 1.7 or higher
showed more than three times the mortality from any cause within
eight years than other people did.
   Death rates rose with rising creatinine levels, starting with as
low as 0.8 to 0.99, but with a marked jump at 1.5, Shulman said.
   About 23 percent of study subjects who showed creatinine levels
of 1.5 to 1.69 were dead within eight years, rising to nearly 30
percent for those with levels between 1.7 and 1.99, Shulman said.
Still higher creatinine levels were associated with death rates of
about 40 percent and more than 50 percent.
   In contrast, people with levels of 0.7 to 1.09 showed death
rates only around 10 percent, he said.
   In a separate analysis that took into account differences in age
and other risk factors among the different groups, creatinine
levels remained a potent predictor of death within eight years,
Shulman said.

   Former pipe fitter Ricky Van Shelton won
four honors and Randy Travis was chosen entertainer of the year
Monday night at the 23rd annual Music City News Country Awards.
   President Bush, appearing on videotape, joined in saluting
veteran entertainer Johnny Cash, who was selected by country music
fans for the Living Legend Award.
   ``Your songs have helped reawaken patriotism in America,'' the
president said during the live telecast to a syndicated audience.
``In every sense of the word, you are a true living legend.''
   Cash, who spoke by satellite from Hawaii, said, ``It's a very
humbling experience to receive an award like this.''
   Shelton was chosen top male vocalist over competitors Vern
Gosdin, George Strait, Dwight Yoakam, Hank Williams Jr. and Travis.
He also won single of the year and favorite music video, both for
``I'll Leave This World Loving You,'' and best album for ``Loving
Proof.''
   ``I'm very honored by all the people who voted for me and who
love country music,'' Shelton said in accepting his award as best
male singer.
   Shelton worked as a pipe fitter for 10 years before leaving the
mountains around Grit, Va., in 1984 to pursue his musical dreams.
Wearing a trademark white cowboy hat, he began visiting Nashville
nightclubs to meet people in the music business and, during a
performance one night, was spotted by a CBS Records executive who
signed him to a recording contract.
   Travis had won nothing until the final category of the evening
was announced at the Grand Ole Opry House. He won over fellow
nominees Reba McEntire, Shelton, Strait, Williams and the Statler
Brothers.
   ``I was beginning to get worried,'' Travis said. ``I try my best
to represent country music in a good way.''
   For the fifth straight time, Miss McEntire was voted female
vocalist of the year over nominees Rosanne Cash, Kathy Mattea, K.T.
Oslin and Tanya Tucker.
   ``If I've said it once, I've said it a thousand times; no one is
as lucky as country music performers to have country music fans,''
she said.
   Patty Loveless was voted star of tomorrow, outpolling three
others, including the late Keith Whitley. In her acceptance
remarks, she paid tribute to Whitley, who died of an alcohol
overdose May 9.
   ``Keith Whitley lives on with his music as far as I'm
concerned,'' she said.
   The Statler Brothers were voted group of the year for the sixth
straight time, raising their total number of awards in that
category to 39.
   Other winners were: Ray Stevens, comedian of the year; Ricky
Skaggs instrumentalist of the year; the Judds, vocal duo of the
year; the Whites, gospel group of the year; the Nashville Network's
``Nashville Now,'' TV series ``A Country Music Celebration: 30th
Anniversary of the Country Music Association,'' as best TV special;
and Yoakam and Buck Owens, vocal collaboration (two or more
performers).
   Voting on the winners was done by subscribers of Music City
News, a magazine published in Nashville, and the deadline for
receiving the ballots was May 1.
   The awards show, which was hosted by the Mandrell sisters, was
one of many special country music events this week in Nashville for
the 18th annual Fan Fair celebration. Approximately 23,000 country
music fans from around the world attend the festivities and 4,400
turned out for the nationally televised awards show.

   The British Broadcasting Corp. World Service today
added 30 minutes to its daily Chinese service.
   That will be in addition to the normal 2{ hours of evening
broadcasts in Mandarin, the main Chinese dialect, the BBC said.
Student demonstrators reportedly have been playing tapes of BBC
news reports over loudspeakers.
   ``In recent weeks we have had evidence from China of a dramatic
increase in awareness of our broadcasts,'' said Peter Udell, BBC's
controller of overseas services.
   ``This extra time on air will enable us to cover world news even
more extensively _ including both the latest events in China itself
and international reaction to them.''
   Chinese troops trying to end a seven-week student protest fired
on unarmed civilians in Beijing over the weekend, and the firing
has continued. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, have been killed.

   Share prices opened lower Tuesday in nervous
reaction to China's military crackdown on pro-democracy
demonstrators, and thousands of residents staged funeral
processions for slain protesters.
   The developments in China have focused new public attention on
the accord under which the British colony will revert to Chinese
rule in 1997.
   Officials reported a run on some China-owned banks Monday in
withdrawals aimed at protesting the Chinese military's killings of
hundreds and perhaps thousands of unarmed protesters in efforts to
quell a popular uprising in Beijing.
   Thousands of angry Hong Kong residents gathered outside the
Xinhua News Agency, the mainland government's de facto embassy in
the territory.
   Governor Sir David Wilson also met Xu Jiatun, head of the
agency, to express his concern over the brutal force used, the
government reported without giving details.
   Wilson originally was to leave Monday for London to discuss Hong
Kong's future with members of the British House of Commons' Foreign
Affairs Committee. He delayed his departure to Wednesday because of
the developments in China.
   In London, some lawmakers called for a reconsideration of the
agreement. But British Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe reaffirmed
Britain's agreement to the accord.
   Under a Chinese-British agreement signed in 1984, China has said
the territory can maintain its capitalistic lifestyle under a ``one
country, two systems'' concept run by Hong Kong people without
Chinese interference.
   Ming Pao, a Chinese-language daily respected for its China
coverage, said a young guard fired four shots at Chinese Premier Li
Peng in the Great Hall of the People on Sunday and the premier was
hit in the thigh. He was not seriously injured, and the guard was
killed, the newspaper reported.
   The Hang Seng Index of blue chips, which plummeted on Monday to
its worst loss since the worldwide market collapse in 1987, fell
about 70 points shortly after the market opened Tuesday, but
rebounded within an hour to 2,075 points.
   On Monday, the index closed at 2,093.61 points, down 581.77
points from Friday. The drop was the worst since the 1987
international market collapse, when the index fell 1,120.99 points.
   In nearby Taiwan, the weighted stock market index dropped 455.44
points to close at 9,120.54, the largest single-day loss in the
market's 27-year history.
   Real estate specialists in Hong Kong said property values could
fall 15 to 20 percent unless the Chinese situation stabilizes.
   ``This is the worst scenario come to pass,'' said real estate
executive Paul Varty. ``Over the past few weeks everyone has been
looking at how this matter will be played out, and this bloodshed
is the worst possible way.''
   Monetary Affairs Secretary David Nendick urged investors to
remain calm and cautioned a run on mainland banks could reflect
adversely on the territory's status as the world's third financial
center after London and New York.
   Some banks said their rate of withdrawal was 30 percent higher
than usual, but no figures were available.
   ``I think they have gone mad,'' said Martin Lee, an outspoken
member of the Legislative Council. ``I believe it (the military
crackdown) is the work by a group of very old men who want to cling
to their power and are prepared to sacrifice thousands and millions
of lives.''
   Protesters continued the rallies held daily to support the
democracy movement since martial law was imposed May 20. On Monday,
about 3,000 Catholics and Protestants marched past the Xinhua
office in a funeral procession for the dead.
   About 98 percent of Hong Kong's population of 5.7 million are
Chinese, and two-thirds are refugees from China or their
descendants.

   Tropical storm Dot hit the central
Philippines today with heavy rain and 47 mph winds, officials said.
There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties.
   Chief weather forecaster Eduardo Parong said the center of the
storm came ashore at the southern tip of Samar island, about 410
miles southeast of Manila. The storm was moving west northwest at
14 mph, he said.
   A weather bulletin said the storm, the third to hit the
Philippines this year, dumped rain over a wide area stretching from
Bataan province west of Manila across Manila Bay to northern
Mindanao. The coast guard said it prevented ships from leaving
various ports.
   There were no reports of damage or casualties from Samar or the
neighboring island of Leyte, which also lay in the storm's path.
Such reports take days to reach the capital because of poor
communications.

<TEXT>
   As the scope of Solidarity's massive
election victory became clear, Lech Walesa sent some advice to his
friend President Bush: keep promoting investment in Poland.
   Then, the shipyard electrician who rallied a restless people to
challenge the Communist system got into his blue Volkswagen van on
Monday afternoon and drove off down the streets of this proud port
city.
   International labor hero Walesa still retains a host of folksy
touches nearly nine years after strikes at the Lenin Shipyard that
spawned Solidarity catapulted him to fame and a Nobel Peace prize.
   He walked with wife, Danuta, and 19-year-old son, Bogdan, to
cast his ballot at city polling station No. 169 in Sunday's
historic elections.
   A young woman outside the polling station gave him a red rose
and praised his tireless efforts.
   Walesa replied with a smile: ``Well, I didn't do all this just
for myself.''
   Like many busy men wrapped up in their work, Walesa has trouble
taking time off.
   ``We hope you can go on vacation. You deserve it,'' the Rev.
Henryk Jankowski, a close adviser, told him as 3,000 people cheered
outside St. Brygida's church. ``We hope you can go to America.''
   Only half of Jankowski's wish is officially scheduled now:
Walesa is heading to the United States this fall for a speech to
the AFL-CIO and most likely another meeting with Bush.
   In fact, Bush is heading over to the Walesas' for lunch next
month.
   There, the president will sit down to a traditional Polish meal
with the 45-year-old Walesa, his wife and at least some of the
couple's eight children in a pleasant residential area outside
central Gdansk.
   ``This is a rehearsal for Bush's visit,'' Walesa said with a
hearty laugh as he acted as host at a private party on election eve
at his single-family home on 54 Polanki Street.
   Bush will sit at a plain wooden table, surrounded by paintings
of nature scenes and religious motifs.
   When Walesa shows Bush into the living room, the president will
see a picture of Pope John Paul II on the wall. ``My highest
authority'' is the way Roman Catholic Walesa refers to his
Polish-born hero and mentor in the Vatican.
   Bush and Walesa met when Bush as vice president visited Warsaw
in 1987. A photograph of the two conferring adorns the wall outside
Walesa's office in the gritty local headquarters of Solidarity two
blocks from the shipyard.
   Like any folk hero, Walesa has his trademarks _ the handle-bar
mustache, the Solidarity badge, the Black Madonna of Czestochowa
pin on his lapel.
   Less well-known is his bluntness.
   On Monday, the labor federation leader, wearing a blue
sportcoat, bulldozed through reporters seeking a statement from him
on election results.
   Walesa said the voting shows Poles want ``very big reforms'' but
also cautioned ``we have to keep searching further'' to solve the
nation's woes.
   Then he bounded up the steps back into the St. Brygida's rectory
to cap a victory he has been seeking along with his larger
successes: assuring the future of the Lenin Shipyard.
   In what he called an act of providence, Polish-born American
multimillionaire Barbara Piasecka-Johnson stepped in with a promise
of a huge investment to rescue the ailing yard from a
government-ordered shutdown.
   After lunch with Mrs. Piasecka-Johnson, her advisers and members
of the Communist-picked shipyard management Monday, Walesa used the
occasion to promote the next phase of his cause: reform of Poland's
faltering and often chaotic economy.
   ``All our political victories will mean nothing if we don't
improve the economy,'' said Walesa.
   Poland faces constant shortages of consumer goods, spare parts
and food items. Many Poles disillusioned with the country's plight
seek work in West Germany, the United States and elsewhere.
   To ease the situation, Poland has been seeking to attract
foreign investment. The Bush administration recently began leading
the cheers for Poland's success in that area.
   ``What Mrs. Piasecka-Johnson is doing is a continuation of what
President Bush has already told us,'' Walesa said in reference to
U.S. administration support for Polish economic reforms. ``She is
fulfilling it immediately.''
   ``So I am sending a personal letter through her to the president
in which I thank him for wanting to meet Poland halfway,'' Walesa
said.
   Walesa then handed Mrs. Piasecka-Johnson a plain white envelope
containing the letter for Bush, as news photographers' cameras
clicked and TV cameras whirred.

<HEAD>GAO Clears VA Official, Agency Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The General Accounting Office has concluded
that the chief medical officer of the Veterans Administration did
not try to improperly dictate the outcome of a study of death rates
in VA hospitals, an agency spokesman said Monday night.
   However, the study does conclude that expressions of concern by
Dr. John Gronvall over the impact of such a study on the VA image
``led some people to believe'' he was giving such instructions,
said Don Smith, a spokesman for the Department of Veterans Affairs,
successor to the VA.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., chairman of the Senate Veterans
Committee, asked for the GAO investigation after The Washington
Post reported last October that Gronvall had ordered a change in
methodology to lower the percentage of VA hospitals showing
abnormal death rates.
   The newspaper reported results of the study in Tuesday editions.
The telephone number listed for the author of the study was
answered by someone who said he no longer lives there.
   Smith said he had seen a copy of the GAO report earlier in the
day.
   Gronvall was travelling and could not be reached, but judging by
his letter to GAO contained in the report commenting in the
findings, ``I think he feels somewhat vindicated,'' said Smith.
   The dispute arose when another VA staff member, the late Dr.
Francis E. Conrad, argued in memos that chaging the study methods
could be seen as ``self serving.''
   The issue is what statistical cut-off to use in judging whether
death rates are within the normal range of variation. Only six of
the VA's 172 hospitals _ 3.5 percent _ would be judged to have
abnormal death rates if the analyst wants to be 99 percent sure
that the determination is not the result of normal fluctations. But
if the analyst wants to be 95 percent sure, 12 hospitals or 7
percent would be judged to have abnormal death rates.
   VA began the study after the Health Care Financing
Administration found that 2.5 percent of the nation's private
hospitals had abnormally high death rates.
   Smith said VA and the financing agency kept records differently
and the percentages arrived at by the two studies could not be
compared.
   The Veterans Department plans to release its study next week
using both statistical cutoffs, Smith said.

<HEAD>Railroad, Pipeline Company Agree on Community Reparations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A railroad and a fuel-shipping
company announced plans Monday to reimburse residents of a
neighborhood stricken by twin disasters last month.
   The deal outlines community reparations, promises $5,000 for
each family evacuated, assures residents that the site is safe and
calls for a study of utilities in the area.
   For the Calnev Pipe Line Co., the agreement cleared city
objections to plans to replace its 14-inch diameter petroleum fuel
line, which exploded in a deadly fireball on May 25, about two
weeks after a Southern Pacific train derailed on May 12.
   Four people, including two residents were killed in the
derailment, and two residents were killed in the pipeline
explosion. Dozens more were injured in the explosion.
   National Transportation Safety Board investigators have focused
on the possibility that the out-of-control freight damaged the
nearby pipeline as it vaulted from the tracks.
   The plan was announced jointly by city officials, executives of
Calnev and the Southern Pacific Transportation Co. and U.S. Rep.
George E. Brown of San Bernardino.
   `No court would have ordered them to do what they've agreed to
do today,'' City Attorney James Penman said. ``The question now is
whether this is going to be finalized.''
   One of the things city officials had sought was immediate
assistance for displaced families, and Penman said, ``that $5,000
reimbursement really helps.''
   The $5,000 is to be paid to each family that returns to their
home. Calnev officials said the payments, estimated to total about
$750,000, would begin Wednesday.
   ``What the agreement is today is a first crack at getting
started,'' said Anthony J. Andrukaitis, vice president of GATX
Terminals, Calnev's corporate owner. ``It is nowhere near a
comprehensive settlement.''
   The companies tentatively agreed to reimburse the city for
overtime paid for police, fire and other emergency personnel,
continue to pay for housing and meals for displaced families and to
buy the homes that were destroyed or severely damaged.
   The new pipeline will buried at least six feet deep, twice the
federal standard and covered with concrete for 600 feet, the length
of the rail disaster area, Andrukaitis said.
   ``If we can get the new line in by Wednesday, we'd test it
Thursday and possibly be operating by Friday,'' Andrukaitis said.
   Mayor W.R. Holcomb said Monday that 95 homes out of the 178 that
were evacuated would be immediately reopened for residents' return.
   ``All the environmental and safety experts agree on the safety
and integrity of the area,'' Holcomb said.
   The city attorney emphasized Calnev's support for a federal
study of the placement of gasoline, natural gas pipelines and other
vital utilities in the greater San Bernardino area. If the study
recommends moving the Calnev fuel line, the company has agreed to
do it, Penman said.
   The proposed engineering study would examine the sort of
juxtaposition that apparently played a role in the double disasters.

   House members have flooded the Rules Committee
with more than 100 proposed amendments to savings and loan bailout
legislation, dimming the chances of floor action this week.
   The Bush administration, which announced its S&amp;L proposal on
Feb. 6 and challenged Congress to act within 45 days, has shown
increasing impatience with the pace of action in the House.
   The Rules Committee, chaired by Rep. Joe Moakley of
Massachusetts, the ranking Democrat after the death last week of
former chairman Claude Pepper, is scheduled to consider the S&amp;L
legislation on Tuesday.
   It will decide which amendments will be considered by the full
House when it takes up S&amp;L legislation written by the Banking,
Judiciary and Ways and Means panels.
   House Majority Leader Thomas Foley, D-Wash., told Moakley last
week that he wants the Rules panel to finish work Tuesday so the
House can take up the bill on Wednesday.
   However, nearly 50 House members have asked to speak to the
Rules Committee and the panel must wade through more than 109
amendments, a difficult task to achieve in one day.
   If the Rules Committee finished work Wednesday, the full House
could begin debate on Thursday, but, since the chamber is out of
session on Friday, any vote likely would be delayed until next week.
   ``The Senate passed this thing on April 19 and the losses (in
S&amp;Ls) have grown by over $500 million since that date,'' said
Assistant Treasury Secretary David W. Mullins.
   The industry ``is just hemorrhaging out there and every day they
delay passage costs at least $10 million,'' he said.
   More than half a dozen of the amendments under consideration
would weaken what the administration considers the key change in
the bill _ a requirement that S&amp;L owners invest at least $3 in
tangible or ``real money'' capital for every $100 in lending. A
high capital level acts as a buffer, absorbing losses before
federal deposit insurance kicks in.
   Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., chairman of the House Banking
Subcommittee on Financial Institutions, had planned to offer an
amendment that would allow regulators, at their discretion, to
count ``supervisory goodwill'' as tangible capital, but pulled back
after the administration decided to oppose it.
   The Washington Post reported in Tuesday editions that Rep. James
Quillen, R-Tenn., planned to urge the Rules Committee to allow the
House to vote on an amendment that would weaken restrictions on
counting goodwill as tangible capital. It said the measure would
benefit several hundred S&amp;Ls, including Heritage Federal Savings &
Loan of Kingsport, Tenn., where Quillen has at least $200,000 on
deposit.
   Wendell Kirk, chief executive of the S&amp;L, was quoted by the
newspaper as saying that without the amendment the institution
would have to come up with cash to replace $28 million in goodwill
it currently counts as capital. Kirk was quoted as saying he asked
Quillen to sponsor the measure.
   Kirk said the amendment's effect on Quillen would be minimal,
perhaps $250, and added: ``If you try to pin a conflict on him it
would be criminal. It would be low down.'' Quillen was quoted as
saying: ``In my mind, there is no conflict'' of interest. Efforts
to reach him by telephone Monday night were unsuccessful.
   Supervisory goodwill is an accounting break offered by
regulators in the early 1980s to institutions that took ailing S&amp;Ls
off the government's hands.
   Annunzio argues that it is unfair to penalize S&amp;Ls who took the
accounting break at the government's urging. However, the
administration argues that it is unfair to taxpayers to allow the
institutions with supervisory goodwill to operate with none of
their owners' money at risk.
   Annunzio and other House members from Illinois, including
Republican Leader Bob Michel, met with Treasury and White House
officials last Thursday in attempt to secure the administration's
support for their compromise amendment. However, Mullins said the
proposal ``is simply not acceptable to us.''
   As an alternate, Annunzio will back an amendment by Rep. Henry
Hyde, R-Ill., that would permit institutions with goodwill to use
administrative appeals to delay the imposition of tougher capital
rules for up to 18 months.
   Other amendments before the Rules Committee would, if permitted
to reach the House floor, reopen virtually every major battle
already fought in the committees that wrote the bill.
   Several amendments would delete provisions designed to help
provide housing to poor people. Others would weaken the requirement
that the S&amp;L industry contribute $300 million a year to pay
interest on government bailout borrowing.

   Gunfire spread around the capital Tuesday
morning, and sources said an army corps opposed to the government's
assault on pro-reform demonstrators was preparing to attack the
corps that carried out the crackdown.
   Soldiers were fighting soldiers around Tiananmen Square and in
southwestern Beijing, the sources said on condition of anonymity. A
Chinese source reported seeing seven wounded soldiers lying on a
street in southeastern Beijing.
   Hundreds of people were killed Saturday when troops shot, beat
and crushed students and other protesters who had been occupying
Tiananmen Square since May 13, demonstrating for democratic reforms
and against corruption.
   Chinese and diplomatic sources said the 38th Army, which is
commissioned with defending the Beijing area, was preparing to move
against the 27th Army, which carried out Saturday's attack.
   The 38th was originally told to enforce martial law imposed by
Premier Li Peng on May 20, but refused to send troops into the city.
   The 27th is based in Hubei province south of Beijing. Each corps
is made up of three divisions and has between 35,000 and 40,000 men.
   The Ming Pao newspaper of Hong Kong quoted what it said were
informed sources in Beijing as saying a young guard shot Li in the
thigh Sunday in the Great Hall of the People. It said Li's wound
was not severe and that his assailant was immediately shot to death.
   By late Monday, the defensive positions taken by troops
occupying central Beijing clearly indicated their focus switched
from shooting citizens to preparing for a battle.
   Troops occupied bridges and other strategic locations going into
the square and shot at cars and pedestrians trying to get through.
   Thousands of troops and tanks occupying the square lined up
along the northern perimeter facing the former imperial palace.
Other tanks took up new positions on key intersections off the
100-acre square.
   Gunfire could be heard from behind the palace, and artillery
shelling was heard in a far northwest suburb of the city.
   Nine tanks and 10 armored personnel carriers left the square
Tuesday morning, heading eastward.
   At least three people died and four were injured Monday as
troops armed with machine guns and automatic rifles kept up
sporadic, indiscriminate firing.
   Chinese witnesses said the dead included a man machine-gunned
from his chin to his stomach. The wounded included a girl shot in
the chest when troops charged up a narrow residential street.
   Anti-government disturbances were reported in Shanghai, Nanjing,
Changsha and at least three cities in the northeast.
   In Shanghai, China's most populous city, all public
transportation stopped Monday as people moved buses and other
barricades into intersections. Thousands of people joined funeral
marches through Nanjing on Monday, and students blocked major
streets to prevent buses from running.
   Chinese sources said Defense Minister Qin Jiwei was stripped of
power for opposing the decision of senior leader Deng Xiaoping to
end seven weeks of student demonstrations with military force.
   Despite repeated announcements on Chinese television praising
the military action against the people of the capital, no national
leader has appeared in public or on television to take
responsibility for the military takeover of Beijing.
   The student unrest triggered a major power struggle in the
Chinese leadership, with Deng, Li and other conservative hardliners
gaining the upper hand and reportedly stripping power from
Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, who favored making
concessions to the students.
   There was a chorus of condemnation from around the world at the
army's attack on the demonstrators. In Washington, President Bush
said he would suspend all military sales and visits of Chinese
military leaders but announced that diplomatic ties would not be
severed.
   The American, British and other embassies were evacuating some
of their nationals from Beijing universities out of fear troops
would move onto campuses to stifle anti-government activities.
   A Beijing University student said, ``Many of the (Chinese)
students have left the dormitories to go home or to find shelter in
Beijing because they fear an imminent attack by the army.''
   The Hong Kong government sent a special flight Monday to
evacuate residents of the British colony.
   Residents in Beijing spent the day preparing for food shortages,
with lines forming for milk, oil, soy sauce and other staples.
   Blockades of buses and burning vehicles made major streets
impassable, and many Beijing residents stayed home from work out of
fear of the roaming bands of soldiers.
   One convoy of 50 to 100 military trucks rumbled through the
diplomatic quarter firing indiscriminately, a U.S. Embassy official
said. More than 40 soldiers later swaggered down the main street
bordering the diplomatic section, firing in the air. Residents
scattered but reappeared to shout jeers after the soldiers.
   Beijing residents enraged by the shooting defied the heavily
armed military by blockading streets and vowing continued support
for the pro-democracy students. Many wore black armbands to honor
the dead.
   ``It's not over, it's just getting started,'' said a 38-year-old
educator outside the main gate of Beijing Normal University, where
hundreds of people gathered to back the students.
   ``The people have just found out what democracy is really
about.''
   On man climbed on top of the lead vehicle of a 20-tank convoy.
He got down but again moved to block its way when the tank tried to
drive around him. Several people had to drag him to safety.
   The official media continued to defend the military crackdown on
unarmed civilians as a justified battle against ``thugs'' and
``ruffians.''
   The national television station late Monday showed footage of
young people throwing rocks at troops and military personnel
carriers entering the city.
   One segment showed people attacking a stalled truck, heaving
rocks through the windshield and saying the two soldiers inside
were beaten to death.

   Spike Lee and Robert Townsend, the two major
representatives of the newest wave of make-it-on-your-own black
film makers, were honored Monday night for doing things their way.
   ``They are independent in spirit, they are determined and they
fought against insurmountable odds and surmounted them,'' said
Melvin Van Peebles, who overcame the odds a generation ago with
``Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song.''
   Van Peebles, an elder statesman of black film making, presented
a special award to Townsend and Lee at the Black Filmmaker
Foundation's 10th anniversary gala and tribute at the Majestic
Theater in New York.
   The foundation is the nation's largest distributor of
independently produced work by black film makers. Its 1,500 members
include major film and television producers, writers, directors,
actors and film students.
   Also being honored were films and videos produced independently
of Hollywood and commercial television in the last 10 years.
   Lee first became known three years ago for ``She's Gotta Have
It,'' a sexual comedy about a young woman and her partners.
   He furthered his reputation with ``School Daze,'' a peek at
black colleges, and his ``Do the Right Thing'' was the talk of the
Cannes film festival last month. It premieres later this month.
   Townsend raised cash with his credit cards to finance
``Hollywood Shuffle,'' a revealing look at the stereotypes and
prejudices black actors face on and off the screen in the
movie-making world.
   He has moved on to four HBO specials and a feature film, ``The
Mighty Quinn,'' with Oscar nominee Denzel Washington. Townsend now
is writing and starring in a musical comedy, ``Heartbeats,'' about
a singing group.

   The Sun-Times Co. announced Monday it has hired
Philadelphia publisher Sam S. McKeel as president and chief
executive officer in a move to become a national media company and
improve the city's second-largest newspaper.
   McKeel, 62, is a 35-year veteran of Knight-Ridder, Inc., most
recently as publisher of The Philadelphia Inquirer and The Daily
News of Philadelphia, and chairman of the firm that oversees both.
   In addition, the Chicago Sun-Times' acting publisher, Charles T.
Price, has been promoted to publisher of the paper, the nation's
10th-largest metropolitan daily, the holding company announced.
   ``These appointments strengthen our management team and
represent our continued commitment to the future of this
organization,'' said Leonard P. Shaykin, company chairman.
   At a brief afternoon news conference in the downtown Sun-Times
building, McKeel said the holding company's offer ``was a lure I
couldn't really resist.''
   He acknowledged that one of his first tasks will be to help
reverse circulation decline. With a daily circulation of 554,670
and 595,311 on Sundays, the Sun-Times is second in the city to the
Chicago Tribune.
   McKeel indicated no major immediate changes are planned in
management or staff, although he declined to specify his agenda.
   ``It would be very presumptuous to think I had changes in mind''
other than to make the newspaper ``more interesting, to expand
readership and expand sales,'' McKeel said.
   Price, 45, called his new boss ``a proven competitor and he is a
winner'' who will help make it possible for the Sun-Times ``to
better serve the community and also to better serve our
advertisers.''
   McKeel said the parent will seek compatible media companies to
acquire in its move to become a national media organization, but he
declined to elaborate.
   Besides the newspaper, the Sun-Times Co.'s holdings include the
Pioneer Press, which publishes 43 weekly papers in the Chicago
suburbs, and Star Publications, a group of 18 twice-weekly suburban
newspapers.
   P. Anthony Ridder, president of Knight-Ridder newspaper
division, said in a statement that ``McKeel's vision and leadership
are treasured assets that will be difficult to replace. He'll be
missed by all of his colleagues.''
   ``Sam's legacy will be the fine team he has built here which
will help to ensure the continued excellence of the Inquirer and
the Daily News. That team will have my close support and
assistance.''
   McKeel will continue to live in the Philadelphia suburb of
Rosemont, commuting to Chicago when necessary.

<HEAD>Race-Bias Ruling Assailed by Civil Rights Groups</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Civil rights advocates are accusing the
Supreme Court of abandoning the nation's 25-year-old commitment to
fair treatment in the workplace for minorities and women.
   They expressed alarm and dismay over a ruling Monday they said
undercuts the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and will make it far more
difficult for workers to prove with statistical evidence that they
are victims of racial or gender bias.
   Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., chairman of the House Judiciary
subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights, said, ``If the
court continues down this path, the civil rights laws will be just
an empty shell.''
   But Edwards did not predict any immediate action in Congress to
reverse the 5-4 court ruling.
   ``It's a major step backwards,'' said Patrick Patterson of the
NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. ``The court has made it
much more difficult for (plaintiffs) to win and at the same time
has made it easier for employers to defend themselves.''
   Barry Goldstein, also with the fund, predicted civil rights
lawyers now will concentrate on cases where they can prove
intentional discrimination and seek big money damages to punish
employers who discriminate.
   ``It is going to make litigation a lot tougher and a lot
nastier,'' he said. ``It means fewer cases and bigger awards.''
   But business leaders hailed the ruling and said most employers
will remain committed to affirmative action even if the threat of
losing lawsuits is reduced.
   Stephen Bokat of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said, ``I'm really
pleased. It went much further than I thought the court would go.
This means fewer specious cases will be brought. Employers are
going to be able to defend these cases more easily,'' he said.
   Monday's ruling focused on so-called ``disparate impact'' cases
where allegations of bias are based on statistics showing
under-representation for minorities rather than deliberate
discrimination.
   The decision divided the high court sharply and prompted bitter
remarks from the dissenting justices.
   ``One wonders whether the majority still believes that race
discrimination _ or, more accurately, race discrimination against
non-whites _ is a problem in our society, or even remembers that it
ever was,'' said Justice Harry A. Blackmun in a dissenting opinion.
   The court overturned a lower court ruling that had favored
Filipinos, Alaska natives and Asians employed during the summer at
Alaska salmon canneries. The minority groups said they have been
relegated to the lower-paying jobs there.
   The justices sent the case back to the lower courts with
instructions to use the high court's new guidelines making it more
difficult for the minority groups to win their lawsuit.
   Justice Byron R. White, writing for the court, said that when
minorities use statistics to show they are bias victims, employers
only must produce evidence that there is a legitimate reason for
apparently neutral business practices.
   The burden of proving the practices are non-discriminatory _ of
persuading a jury there is no bias _ does not shift to the
employer, White said.
   He added that the workers must suggest alternative practices
that do not have an unfair impact on minorities, but said employers
cannot be forced to adopt the alternatives if they are more costly.
   The court also limited the statistical evidence that minorities
can use to prove discrimination.
   For example, White said a lack of minority group members in
skilled jobs is not evidence of bias if the absence reflects ``a
dearth of qualified non-white applicants for reasons that are not
(the employer's) fault.''
   He said the minority groups must show that any
under-representation in skilled jobs is tied directly to specific
business practices under attack.
   White said that without such protection for employers their only
recourse to eliminate racial imbalance in their work forces would
be unlawful quotas.
   In other action, the court:
   _Ruled, 5-2, that the main method used by the Church of
Scientology to receive money from members does not entitle them to
federal income tax deductions.
   _Handed artists and authors a victory by unanimously ruling that
a homeless-rights group in the nation's capital does not hold
exclusive copyright to a sculpture it commissioned an artist to
create.
   _Cleared the way for trial of a government lawsuit against junk
bond specialist Michael Milken and removed a major obstacle to a
$650 million payment by his former employer to investors and the
federal treasury.
   _Rejected an appeal by Medicare patients who want to use their
own money to pay for an assistant surgeon in eye cataract
operations.

   President Bush once suggested that the more he
learned about the Chinese the less he understood them. Now, his
experience in China is a guiding influence in setting U.S. policy
toward the troubled giant.
   In his announcement Monday of a cutoff in U.S. arms sales to
protest the bloody suppression of China's pro-democracy movement,
the government's No. 1 China hand said he took the action because
he understands China ``reasonably well.''
   For that reason, Bush said the events of the past few days could
only leave him with ``a saddened heart.''
   ``I am trying to take steps that will encourage a peaceful
change, and yet recognize the fact that China does have a great
pride in its own history. And my recommendations are based on my
knowledge of Chinese history,'' Bush said.
   That doesn't mean he understands what has happened, said Bush,
who less than four months ago shook hands with bicyclists in
Beijing's Tiananmen Square, presented Texas cowboy boots to Prime
Minister Li Peng and bantered about exercise regimens with senior
leader Deng Xiaoping.
   Of the military assault that left hundreds dead and thousands
wounded, Bush said: ``I condemn it; I don't try to explain it.''
   Asked for his best assessment of the political situation in
China, Bush also demurred. ``It's too obscure,'' he said at a news
conference Monday.
   But China expertise has always been a major element of the
well-laden foreign-policy resume that Bush brought to the Oval
Office.
   For Bush, who headed the U.S. liaison office in Beijing for 16
months in 1974-75 and since then has visited the nation five times,
this expertise is also the source of extreme caution _ a caution
that previously provoked criticism.
   In his 1987 pre-election autobiography, ``Looking Forward,''
Bush wrote that during his tour of duty in China he often had the
``feeling the more you learn about the Chinese, the less you really
understand them.''
   ``I have a special affection for the Chinese people. I've kept
up my knowledge of China and my relationship with various leaders
there,'' he told a business audience Monday night.
   Although House and Senate leaders of both parties were near
unanimous in their praise for Bush's stern but careful actions
Monday, his reticence in speaking out for human rights when he
visited Beijing in late February prompted criticism.
   The criticism intensified when a dissident he invited to a
farewell banquet, astrophysicist Fang Lizhi, was barred by Chinese
police from attending the ceremony.
   Still, Bush defended this caution anew on Monday while issuing
his strongest criticism thus far of the Chinese government. ``This
is not a time for anything other than a prudent, reasoned
response,'' he said.
   Bush said his actions Monday will deny the Chinese more than
$600 million worth of U.S. government military equipment sales and
an estimated $85 million or so annually in private arms sales.
   He also banned visits by Chinese military officials, offered
humanitarian and medical assistance to those wounded in the assault
and suggested that the United States would extend the visas of
Chinese students here afraid to return to their homeland.
   Bush, however, said he was not ready to do ``something more
flamboyant,'' such as recommend trade sanctions or recall the U.S.
ambassador, ``because I happen to believe that this relationship is
vital to the United States.''
   Bush suggested, as he has in the past, that he's sensitive to
China's own sensitivity to outside criticism.
   ``China historically has been less than totally interested in
what other countries think of their performance,'' Bush said.
Still, he expressed hope that ``the depth of the feeling towards
democracy is so great that you can't put the genie back in the
bottle and return to total repression.''
   Bush's actions won support from many on Capitol Hill.
   ``This is a time to allow the president to lead on that kind of
issue, especially when you have a president with this level of
personal expertise in Chinese affairs,'' said Sen. David Boren,
D-Okla., chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee.

   Vestiges of school segregation remain in
Topeka 35 years after it lost the Brown vs. Board of Education
decision, which paved the way for desegregation of schools
nationwide, a federal appeals court ruled.
   The 10th U.S. Court of Appeals panel's decision, made available
Monday, reversed a ruling that would have closed the case that
found ``separate but equal'' schools for blacks and whites
unconstitutional.
   The case was reopened 10 years ago by parents who said Topeka's
schools were still segregated.
   ``We won,'' said Rich Jones, an attorney representing the
parents of 17 black schoolchildren. ``We feel that 10 years of work
was not in vain. We feel vindicated by the decision. It's been
quite a long time coming.''
   The group involved in the lawsuit included parent Linda Brown
Buckner, who was a student when her name went on the original
lawsuit.
   ``My first reaction was shock, then I was pleased, very
pleased,'' said Cheryl Brown Henderson, Buckner's sister. ``I
believe that the case showed that there is a lot of educational
enhancement that is not taking place here.''
   In its decision published in Denver on Friday, the panel
rejected U.S. District Judge Richard Rogers' contention in April
1987 that parents of minority students had to prove a pattern of
intentional discrimination to force the district to come up with a
plan for more racially balanced schools.
   ``Because we are convinced that Topeka has not sufficiently
countered the effects of both the momentum of its pre-Brown
segregation and its subsequent segregative acts in the 1960s, we
reverse,'' the appeals court said. The judges also reversed a lower
court ruling that the Topeka school district had not violated Title
VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
   Gary Sebelius, an attorney for the the school district, said
officials were awaiting receipt of the dissenting opinion in the
2-1 ruling before deciding whether to appeal.
   He added that the ruling confirmed the high quality of Topeka's
schools.
   ``Throughout their decision they note that Topeka offers
excellent educational opportunities to all its students, wherever
they be,'' Sebelius said. ``There was absolutely no hint or contest
of the quality education the district provides.''
   The court noted that neither the school district nor the Topeka
community was actively resisting desegregation, and cited the
national recognition of the district's innovative curriculum.
   ``This active engagement has largely been directed at concerns
other than desegregation, however,'' the appeals court said. ``For
the most part, the Topeka school district has exercised a form of
benign neglect.''
   The original class-action lawsuit challenged the
constitutionality of a Kansas law authorizing school segregation.
The May 17, 1954, Supreme Court decision paved the way for
nationwide school desegregation and busing.
   Topeka schools were required to submit an integration plan,
which was approved in 1955.
   In 1979, the case was revived by black parents who claimed
Topeka had failed to desegregate its schools. Rogers found the
school district to be integrated and unified.
   Local officials of the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People at the time blasted Rogers' decision, saying
blacks could not get a fair hearing because of racism in Topeka.
   The appeals court ruled that the district's policy of permitting
students to attend neighborhood schools was insufficient to
desegregate schools because neighborhoods are still racially
segregated. Topeka is 90 percent white.
   There are about 14,000 students in the city school district.

<HEAD>At Least 50 Nuclear Weapons Dropped on Ocean Floor</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs 7th graf, Twenty-seven, to CORRECT that all sunk submarines
were not nuclear-powered</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   U.S. and Soviet naval accidents have littered
the ocean floor with at least 50 nuclear weapons and 10 nuclear
reactors since World War II, according to a report released today
by the Greenpeace environmental group.
   Forty-three of the 50 weapons and six of the nine reactors are
Soviet, and the real number may be much higher because so few
details are known of secretive Soviet navy operations, said William
Arkin, an analyst who worked with Greenpeace on the project.
   ``We got no information at all from the Soviets,'' said Arkin,
who works at the Institute for Policy Studies, a liberal Washington
interest group. ``We were totally unsuccessful in getting any kind
of real response from them. And we were totally unsuccessful in
getting any information from U.S. intelligence about Soviet naval
accidents.''
   Using material obtained from the U.S. government under the
Freedom of Information Act, the researchers listed 1,276 accidents
since World War II involving military vessels.
   The accidents caused more than 2,800 deaths and ranged in
severity from the loss of an entire vessel and crew to minor
collisions and fires that caused little damage and few if any
injuries.
   Greenpeace said that of the accidents, 228 involved aircraft
carriers, 406 other major surface warships, 182 supply ships, 142
minor military ships and 75 amphibious vessels. Separately, 75
incidents involved sinkings.
   Twenty-seven submarines have sunk in that period, including five
Soviet, four American, four French and three British, as well as
submarines from West Germany, Israel, Pakistan, Peru, Spain and
Turkey, the analysts reported in their 101-page study.
   Perhaps the most serious accident was the sinking of a Soviet
Yankee-class submarine on Oct. 6, 1986, with 32 nuclear warheads
and two nuclear torpedoes aboard 600 miles northeast of Bermuda.
   More recently, a Soviet `Mike' class submarine sank off the
coast of Norway in April with two nuclear reactors and two nuclear
tipped torpedoes aboard, the report said.
   ``Between 1975-1985, according to the U.S. Navy, the Soviet
Union had over 200 serious submarine accidents,'' according to a
summary of the report. ``The Soviet Union has had more sinkings,
more propulsion failures, and according to U.S. intelligence
sources, more accidents than the United States.''
   Greenpeace earlier revealed information about two U.S. accidents
that received wide publicity over the past month. In 1965, an A-4
warplane fell off the USS Ticonderoga off Okinawa with a hydrogen
bomb aboard, and on Nov. 22, 1975, a fire aboard the USS Belknap
came within 40 feet of nuclear weapons.
   Although the report carried the greatest detail about incidents
involving U.S. vessels, its sharpest criticism was of the Soviets.
Arkin said he planned to deliver a Russian-language version of the
study to the Soviet Embassy in Washington and would seek a meeting
with Soviet officials.
   ``Official secrecy, particularly that of the Soviet Union, as
well as sporadic news media interest in reporting routine
accidents, are major impediments to compiling a complete record,''
the report said.
   ``Of the 1,276 accidents, 799 have involved naval ships of the
United States,'' it said. ``This preponderance of U.S. accidents
does not mean a higher accident rate than other navies,
particularly the Soviet Navy.
   ``Many hundreds more Soviet accidents are known to have
occurred, but due to inadequate data and excessive secrecy, we have
been unable to document specific dates or circumstances,'' it said.
   Asked in a telephone interview to give an example of a Soviet
naval accident in which nuclear weapons or reactors were suspected
but not documented to be involved, Arkin cited the sinking of a
destroyer in the Black Sea in 1974.
   ``A Kashin-class destroyer with 275 crewmen sank with all hands.
Our speculation is that there were probably nuclear torpedoes
aboard,'' said Arkin.

<HEAD>Jury Selected As Abortion Demonstration Trial Takes Center Stage</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The judge sat center stage, the defendants
took up the orchestra, mezzanine and balcony and a defense attorney
asked potential jurors if they'd ever had an abortion.
   Set in a 300-seat theater, the drama was real as 155
anti-abortion activists went on trial Monday for trespassing during
a protest at a clinic April 15.
   The judge had to rent the hall intended for nightclub acts and
jazz ensembles because no local courtroom was big enough.
   ``Here in the first row,'' attorney B. Larry Smith asked before
a jury of six was selected, ``has anyone had an abortion?''
   When a prosecutor objected, Smith asked whether any of the 95
prospective jurors knew of anyone who had had an abortion. About
half said yes.
   More than 180 people were arrested and charged with trespassing
during the protest organized by Operation Rescue. The charge
carries up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine. Some pleaded no
contest and received six months' probation.
   Judge James D. Arnold merged the cases and rented a theater at
the Tampa Performing Arts Center complex for about $5,000 for what
is expected to be a weeklong trial.
   ``We're not here to determine the issue of abortion,'' said
Assistant State Attorney Hank Lavandera, standing before a stage
set up with a makeshift judge's bench.
   ``You are being selected to serve on a jury, not on a
legislative delegation,'' he said. ``What I'm concerned with is if
you can set aside your own preconceptions and follow the law.''

<HEAD>Agreement Must be Studied in Artificial Insemination Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A woman who got a semen sample from a friend and
bore a child _ then got a court to rule that the man had no rights
as the father _ has been dealt a setback by the Colorado Supreme
Court.
   The Juvenile Court judge who held that the friend was not,
technically, the father must take another look at the case to
determine precisely what the pre-conception agreement between the
two was, the high court ruled Monday.
   The woman had argued that she never promised to recognize her
friend as the father and that even if she had, state law specifies
that sperm donors have no parental rights. Court papers identified
the couple only by initials.
   Records showed that in 1985, J.R. donated semen to E.C., a woman
he had known for two years. A doctor inseminated her, and she gave
birth in 1986.
   J.R. then sought a declaration he was the father, alleging that
he and E.C. had agreed in advance that he would be treated as the
father.
   He also argued that the law giving sperm donors no parental
rights did not apply to unmarried women who knew the donor.
   Juvenile Court Judge Morris E. Cole ruled that evidence of a
pre-conception agreement was irrelevant.
   But Justice Anthony Vollack said that what the man and woman
agreed to in advance is indeed relevant. The high court cited a
California case in which a sperm donor was declared the legal
father and given visitation rights.

   The high school senior's 250-word essay told how advertisers use
hidden messages to influence consumers. Printed in tiny letters at

   ``Jason had that little gimmick in there, which I think the

``Everything else being just about equal, I think it gave him the

   ``When I entered the contest, everybody said we should write

<HEAD>Emigration Drops During May, But Exodus Still at 10-Year High</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union dropped
sharply last month but is still at a 10-year high, according to
figures released today.
   The Intergovernmental Committee for Migration said 3,333 Soviet
Jews registered at a Vienna transit center in May, a 20 percent
drop from April. The committee helps Jews leave the Soviet Union
and resettle elsewhere.
   Only 96 emigrants opted for new homes in Israel, said committee
spokeswoman Regina Boucault. Most want to settle in the United
States, she said.
   Ms. Boucault said the agency had no explanation for the decline
in emigration.
   The May arrivals brought the 1989 total to 16,197; 524 chose the
Jewish state as their destination, she said. The total for all of
1988 was 20,082.
   The program began in 1971 and reached a peak in 1979 when 51,328
Jews were allowed to leave the Soviet Union. The numbers dropped
sharply after the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan chilled
East-West relations.
   The pace of emigration is now at its highest level since 1979.

<HEAD>Illinois Trying to Catch Up in Riverboat Gambling Race</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Like a paddlewheel steamer trailing in
a Mississippi River race, Illinois is trying to pass Iowa in the
riverboat gambling sweepstakes and pull in the fresh catch: dollars.
   Backers of Illinois legislation to legalize riverboat gambling
say the payoff could be 2,500 new jobs, $200 million in initial
riverfront investment and as much as $700 million a year in
economic spinoffs.
   The loser, they say, could be left at the dock.
   Iowa already has authorized riverboat gambling on the
Mississippi beginning in 1991.
   ``The (state) there first is going to attract the people,'' said
Sen. Denny Jacobs, sponsor of legislation to legalize riverboat
gambling next year on the Illinois side of the Mississippi and much
of the Illinois River.
   Jacobs' bill, and one allowing betting on the Des Plaines River,
were overwhelmingly approved by the Senate last month and are now
in the House.
   The proposals would allow blackjack, poker, slot machines and
other games on 19th-century-style riverboats or casino cruise ships.
   Unlike the Iowa legislation, which limits bets to $5 and losses
to $200 per person per excursion, the Illinois bills permit losses
up to $500. Gamblers can wager no more than an initial $5 but can
parlay their winnings without limit.

   The score was tied 1-1 in the bottom of the last
inning. The bases were loaded. Then the Bayside pitcher walked the
batter. There was joy in Tottenville.
   But wait _ the Tottenville boy was wearing a necklace!
   It wasn't a bad hop but a little-known rule against wearing
jewelry in high school baseball games that almost toppled
Tottenville last week in a New York City Public School Athletic
League playoff.
   But after a weekend of wrangling, the Tottenville nine came out
on top.
   National high school baseball rules say that the second person
on a team found wearing jewelry heads for the bench. The first
offender gets a warning.
   When Tottenville shortstop Jason Kish drew a walk Friday in the
seventh and final inning, Tottenville was declared the winner. But
Bayside coach Pat Torney cried foul, saying he had spotted a gold
chain around Kish's neck.
   Torney said he had already complained about a Tottenville player
wearing a bracelet. He said the umpires refused to warn the first
player or eject Kish.
   Bayside appealed to a league commissioner, who ruled that Kish
should have been ejected and ordered the game restarted at the
bottom of the seventh with the score tied, the bases loaded and
someone else batting for Kish.
   There was no joy in Tottenville. The team appealed. The league
director ruled that the original result should stand since the
umpires did not issue a warning when the first piece of jewelry was
found.
   Bayside, behind again with just one pitch to go, appealed to
Sylvia Schecter, director of health, physical education and school
sports. After an hour of testimony Monday, she declared Tottenville
the winner.

   Pepper, a Democrat who championed the elderly during six decades

<HEAD>Massachusetts Senate Approves BU Takeover of Chelsea Schools</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Senate has approved a plan by Boston
University to take over the troubled Chelsea schools for 10 years.
   In a 29-10 vote Monday, the Senate endorsed the
first-in-the-nation plan for a private university to run a public
school system.
   Chelsea schools have been woefully underfunded, according to
officials, and the 3,400 students in the largely working-class and
predominantly Spanish-speaking city outside Boston have one of the
highest dropout rates in the state.
   The bill now goes to the House, which gave its approval last
week but must consider a Senate amendment requiring periodic
reports to the state by BU.
   Monday's vote was criticized by teachers unions who say the plan
would deprive teachers of access to important personnel records.
Many officials, including Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, have also
criticized provisions exempting BU from open meeting laws.
   Dukakis has not said whether he will sign the legislation.
   BU said it will raise money from foundations and corporations
and offer a variety of programs, including education of
preschoolers and aid for pregnant teen-agers.
   ``The schoolchildren of Chelsea are going to be very happy,''
said BU spokesman Ed King. ``We're going to abide by the open
meeting and the public records laws, and we've said all along we're
going to abide by those.''
   ``The fight is not over,'' declared Paul Devlin, president of
the Massachusetts Federation of Teachers, which represents
Chelsea's teachers. The union has sued to block what he called ``an
arrogant kind of takeover.''
   Rosanne Bacon, president of the Massachusetts Teachers
Association, called the takeover an embarassment for the state.
   ``It's outrageous that Chelsea has been allowed to get to the
condition it's in,'' she said.

   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini was buried today
after frenzied mourners knocked his body to the ground and ripped
his white burial shroud to pieces for mementos of the revolutionary
who ruled Iran for 10 years.
   Thousands of Revolutionary Guards and civilians pushed and
shoved around the graveside, kicking up clouds of dust as
Khomeini's body was taken from a metal casket and lowered to the
grave at 4:45 p.m.
   ``They are burying a sacred body,'' screamed a television
announcer, his voice hoarse with emotion, as soldiers piled
concrete blocks on top of the shrouded body.
   ``Oh, Father, don't leave your children! Oh, father, don't leave
your beloved!'' he wailed.
   Khomeini, the driving force of Iran's Islamic revolution, died
Saturday at age 86.
   Amid scenes of mass hysteria, the huge crowd surrounding the
grave beat their heads with their hands in expressions of grief and
threw dust on themselves to show they wanted to be buried with
their spiritual patriarch.
   Several people were knocked unconscious in crushes at the
cemetery and earlier at Mosalla Mosque, where mourners stopped the
nearly 10-hour funeral procession.
   They blocked the path of a van driving the body to the cemetery,
grabbed the corpse out of an open wooden coffin and ripped the
shroud to pieces. The body fell to the ground.
   In the chaos, Khomeini's son was knocked down, but appeared
uninjured.
   State television later showed mourners grabbing the body and
pulling the shroud, until the feet could be seen. The broadcast
then was cut off abruptly for several minutes.
   The body was rewrapped, placed in a closed metal casket and
airlifted to the Baheshte Zahra cemetery, with mourners clinging to
the helicopter's landing sled until it was several feet off the
ground.
   Khomeini was buried next to Iranians who helped him seize power
in the 1979 revolution that toppled a 2,500-year-old monarchy, and
soldiers killed in the eight-year Iran-Iraq war.
   There was no immediate word on whether people were killed or
injured in the crowd that gathered in 91-degree heat. At least
eight people were killed and hundreds hurt on Monday during a
similar huge show of mass grief.
   The chaos occurred when the grieving multitudes stopped the
funeral procession a half-mile from the Mosalla Mosque, where
Khomeini's body had lain in state since Monday in an
air-conditioned, glass-encased bier.
   Two helicopters had landed nearby, and officials were moving the
body from a hearse to a helicopter when the crowd pushed toward
them.
   Security forces fired in the air to disperse the crowds, but the
throngs remained, IRNA reported.
   Earlier, Khomeini's son, Ahmad, 43, was knocked down outside the
mosque. His black turban fell off as he was hoisted above the
crowds and passed from hand to hand to an ambulance at the edge of
the square. He appeared pale and shaken.
   The hearse carrying the body was stranded in a sea of mourners
clad in black, unable to move forward because of the crowds, IRNA
said.
   Shouts of ``Allah Akbar!'' _ God is Great _ echoed across the
city.
   Many of Tehran's 6 million people turned out to bid Khomeini
farewell. Millions more converged on the city from other regions,
the official media reported.
   The procession began at 7 a.m. when Khomeini's devout militants,
the Revolutionary Guards, carried his body down from the bier.
   Khomeini's body lay on the ground in the open air as the
white-bearded Ayatollah Mohammad-Reza Golpaygani prayed.
Golapaygani, one of the four remaining senior ayatollahs in Iran,
lifted his spectacles to wipe tears with a handkerchief.
   After the 30-minute service, Khomeini's body was placed in a
wooden coffin covered with a white cloth, then carried by
Revolutionary Guards from hand to hand into a white van.
   Crowds cried hysterically. Readings from the Koran, Islam's holy
book, blared from the mosque's minaret as the masses cried:
``Farewell beloved imam!'' and ``Oh Khomeini, why have you left
us?''
   In the chaos, women, clad in head-to-toe black chadors, were
rubbing shoulders with men, defying an Islamic ban on physical
contact between a woman and a man other than her husband.
   Firefighters sprayed mourners with water to cool them off.
   About 2 million frenzied mourners had kept a nightlong
candle-lit vigil around the bier.
   Some scratched their faces until the blood ran and threw ashes
over their clothes.
   Khomeini died of a heart attack 11 days after intestinal surgery
without resolving the problem of who would succeed him. He left a
29-page ``political testament,'' excerpts of which were read over
Tehran radio on Monday.
   The excerpts made no reference to how Iran should be governed
after his death. But such proposals may have been in sections not
made public.
   President Ali Khamenei, 49, was appointed caretaker leader
Sunday. A presidential election and referendum on constitutional
reforms, which are likely to increase the president's executive
power, are scheduled for Aug. 18.
   Khamenei's swift appointment was designed mainly to fill the
vacuum amid political turmoil that has prevailed since Khomeini
launched his resurgence of Islamic fundamentalism in February with
a call for the death of British novelist Salman Rushdie.
   In the absence of a single personality who can match Khomeini's
religious and political authority, it seemed likely Iran would be
ruled by a collective leadership.
   Khamenei has endorsed the presidential candidacy of Parliament
Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani, 55, a political ally and the only
declared candidate.

   Democrats today nominated Thomas S. Foley of
Washington as the 49th speaker of the House, moving decisively to
replace Jim Wright and end months of political tumult spawned by
charges of ethical misconduct.
   The full House was expected to ratify the majority Democrats'
choice by the end of the day, and Foley was moving to set the tone
for his stewardship.
   ``I hope that this can be the beginning of the movement of the
House back to the business for which the public elected us to
serve,'' he told reporters as he arrived at the Capitol. He said he
hoped to quickly ``restore a mood of conciliation, reconciliation
and cooperation between the two parties.''
   Foley, unopposed, was approved by the Democratic caucus in a
unanimous voice vote. Still to come, perhaps next week, were
contests for other Democratic leadership posts made vacant by the
ethics turmoil, including the No. 2 position of majority leader
held by Foley.
   Republicans were powerless to stop Foley's election, since
Democrats command a 259-175 majority. But they voted this morning
to nominate Minority Leader Bob Michel of Illinois as their
candidate for speaker in a symbolic act.
   Michel, who by tradition was to introduce Foley to the House,
told fellow Republicans today that their party has been mistreated
under Democratic control, and just getting rid of Wright won't
correct things by itself.
   ``The House has been corrupted by the absolute power of
one-party domination and it isn't going to be cured by a
personality transplant,'' he said, accepting his party's nomination.
   The Republican National Committee already was attacking Foley as
a political enemy more liberal than his reputation indicated.
   Wright, D-Texas, was driven from the leadership by ethics
charges that he tried to skirt House rules on outside income. He
steadfastly maintained his innocence, but said in a dramatic speech
to his colleagues last week that he would step down to prevent the
controversy from paralyzing the House.
   Republican strategists are trying to label all Democrats as
corrupt from an uninterrupted third of a century ruling the House.
They cite as examples Wright's unprecedented decision to resign the
speakership because of ethics charges, and the announcement by
Majority Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif., that he'll step down to avoid
an ethics inquiry.
   Foley, who recognizes that Democrats must not be seen as less
ethical than Republicans, has said revising House ethics rules and
campaign laws will be a top priority.
   Foley, 60, of Spokane, is a 12{-year veteran of the House
leadership with a reputation for negotiating the tough deals
through persistence and compromise.
   As majority leader, Foley was spared some of the pressure
directed at the speaker's office, but Republicans began firing at
him before his election today.
   Mark Goodin, communications director of the Republican National
Committee, distributed a four-page memorandum portraying Foley as
an ``ultra-liberal'' who has cleverly managed to avoid any
left-leaning label.
   ``Over the years, Foley has been able to create a reputation
based on a false perception that he is a bipartisan, moderate
political creature,'' Goodin said. The memo cited the relatively
low marks over the years Foley's voting record has earned from
conservative groups.
   Foley declined to comment directly on the attack, saying through
a spokesman that he hoped ``to establish a sense of comity and
respect within the House.''
   Foley has represented the congressional district on the eastern
side of Washington since 1965. With a mostly mainstream Democratic
voting record, he has had some close elections in that fairly
conservative territory although wider margins in recent years.
   Foley entered the House leadership when former Speaker Thomas P.
O'Neill appointed him as majority whip, a position which now is
elected. He earned a reputation as a master of compromise, and when
O'Neill retired at the end of 1986 and Wright was elected speaker,
Foley moved up uncontested to majority leader.
   Now, as then, Foley refused to coast into his new slot. Instead
of taking his votes for granted, he tried to contact every Democrat
in the House to ask for their support.
   Out of courtesy, Foley waited to make the calls this time until
Wright last Wednesday formally announced his resignation _ even
though Foley knew for months that Wright was thinking of stepping
down.
   Foley met Monday with Wright to discuss their transition.
Although Wright was resigning his speakership effective today, he
plans to remain in the House until later this month.
   Democrats plan to meet next week to fill their other leadership
vacancies _ Foley's post of majority leader and Coelho's No. 3 job
of majority whip.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri was favored over Rep. Ed
Jenkins of Georgia to succeed Foley as majority leader.
   Gephardt, who ran unsuccessfully last year for the Democratic
presidential nomination, is considered the favorite to succeed
Foley. Jenkins is a popular member of the more conservative wing of
the party.
   The whip's race is a contest among four already-powerful House
Democrats: William H. Gray III of Pennsylvania, the chairman of the
House Democratic Caucus; David Bonior of Michigan, the chief deputy
whip; Beryl Anthony of Arkansas, chairman of the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee, and Henry Waxman of California, a
leading member of the Energy and Commerce Committee.

   New Jersey voters cast ballots in a primary today with four
Republicans running neck and neck for the GOP mantle of departing
two-term Gov. Thomas H. Kean.
   Voters also decided on a new mayor in Jackson, Miss., and the
fate of the Ranch Seco nuclear plant in California.
   The Election Day maxim of ``every vote counts'' has more
validity than usual, said one campaigner in New Jersey's Republican
primary.
   ``You always say that because it's always true, but this race
looks to be extraordinarily close,'' said Cliff Pintak, campaign
manager for Assembly Speaker and Republican hopeful Chuck Hardwick.
   Hardwick and the three other GOP frontrunners _ U.S. Rep. James
Courter, former Attorney General Cary Edwards and state Sen.
William Gormley _ scrambled around the state Monday making final
pleas to voters at train stations, senior citizen centers and
shipping centers.
   A fifth major Republican candidate, state Sen. Gerald Cardinale,
has lagged in the polls and in fund-raising.
   The GOP candidates spent an estimated $7 million on television
advertisements alone.
   The popular Kean, who is barred by law from seeking a third
straight four-year term, has made no endorsement.
   There has been little suspense in the Democratic primary, with
U.S. Rep. James Florio enjoying a large lead in the polls over
Assemblyman Alan Karcher and Princeton Mayor Barbara Sigmund.
   In Sacramento, Calif., voters were deciding whether the
problem-plagued Rancho Seco plant should be closed. A majority of
the board members of the utility district say they will abide by
the results of the non-binding vote.
   Critics say the 15-year-old facility is unsafe and are angry at
rising utility bills and a $400 million repair bill after a 1985
overcooling accident.
   Supporters say the plant's bad days are over now that it has
been overhauled and has new managers.
   In Jackson, Miss., state Rep. Kane Ditto, a Democrat, faced only
token opposition from three challengers in the mayoral election.
Ditto upset incumbent Dale Danks Jr. in the May 16 primary and was
opposed by Republican John Bonelli and independents Liz Gilchrist
and Ricky Godbolt. Danks was mayor for 12 years.

   Here, at a glance, are developments in China
today:
</TEXT>
<NOTE>RIVAL ARMY FACTIONS</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Armies loyal to rival political factions were reported battling
for control of Beijing.
   Soldiers of the 28th Army, believed loyal to ousted Communist
Party leader Zhao Ziyang, exchanged fire with the 27th Army, which
invaded central Beijing Saturday night to crush the pro-democracy
movement.
   A soldier of the Beijing-based 38th Army said it was fired upon
by the 27th on the west side of the city.
   The 27th has been fortifying positions around Tiananmen Square.
   Hundreds of soldiers were seen along the airport road and a main
highway in northeastern Beijing. Residents said the troops, from
the northeast city of Shenyang, were ``not shooting at the people.''
</TEXT>
<NOTE>OFFICIAL CASUALTIES</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The government announced that nearly 300 people had been killed
and more than 7,000 injured and said the figure included soldiers,
``thugs,'' bystanders and 23 students.
   The official figures were far lower than unofficial estimates of
more than 500 deaths.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>LI SHOOTING</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   A young guard reportedly shot four times at Premier Li Peng in
Beijing's Great Hall of the People on Sunday, slightly wounding him
in the thigh.
   The guard was immediately killed, according to the report in a
Hong Kong daily.
   Li has not been seen in public since May 25, five days after he
declared martial law.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>DENIAL OF DENG'S DEATH</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The government denied a report from Taiwan that leader Deng
Xiaoping had died, calling it a ``fabrication designed to make
people uneasy and create chaos.''
   Deng, 84, has been out of sight since May 16 and there were
reports he was hospitalized for treatment of prostate cancer.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>OTHER REPORTS OF FIGHTING</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   A contingent of soldiers fired directly on a crowd near a major
intersection west of Tiananmen, a foreign witness said. The witness
heard screams from the crowd, but did not know if anyone was hit.
   Another source said tanks were moving north and firing near the
university area in northwestern Beijing.
   Soldiers at some intersections have fired at any passing
vehicles.
   Unidentified people opened fire from a window on soldiers and
tanks outside the military museum in western Beijing, a witness
said. Some students and other civilians are known to have captured
weapons from soldiers over the weekend.

<NOTE>BEIJING AT STANDSTILL</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   People hoarded food, public transportation was at a halt and
many people did not go to work.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>DEMONSTRATIONS IN OTHER CITIES</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Anti-government demonstrations have spread to Shanghai, Nanjing,
Chengdu and numerous other cities. Shanghai Radio said student-led
barricading of streets ``had brought the whole municipal economy to
the brink of collapse.''
</TEXT>
<NOTE>FOREIGNERS IN CHINA</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign embassies, including the U.S. mission, urged their
nationals to leave and some arranged special charter flights to
speed evacuation.
   Hundreds of anxious foreigners jammed airline offices and
swamped embassy switchboards with telephone calls. Several thousand
filled the international departure area of Beijing Airport.
   Several U.S. companies have accelerated a withdrawal of
expatriates from Beijing. General Electric Co., International
Business Machines Corp., Chrysler Corp. and Boeing Co. were among
companies that said they had evacuated people because of the
violence and uncertainty elsewhere in China.
   Some companies far from the violence said they had no plans to
move staff, and that operations were normal.

<HEAD>Maximum Sentences Given To Two Convicted In Policeman's Murder</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two narcotics dealers who murdered a rookie
policeman _ allegedly on orders from a drug lord _ were sentenced
to the maximum 25 years to life in prison today as more than 100
police officers cheered.
   A third dealer received the same sentence May 16 for his role in
the 1988 death of Edward Byrne, whose slaying outside the home of a
drug witness became an issue in the White House campaign and a
battle cry for law enforcement.
   Justice Thomas Demakos, in sentencing Scott Cobb and Todd Scott,
recommended that neither receive parole.
   Neither Cobb, 25, nor Scott, 20, addressed the judge.
   Demakos promised, as he did at the sentencing of co-defendant
Philip Copeland, that his last act as a judge would be to remind
the parole board of his recommendation. He labeled the pair ``unfit
to live in society.''
   Byrne, 22, was shot five times in the head at close range while
he sat in a patrol car guarding the home of a drug witness.
   Prosecutors charged that the officer was killed on orders from
alleged drug lord Howard ``Pappy'' Mason in retaliation for his
jailing on a weapons charge.
   Mason has not been charged in the slaying and has denied
involvement.
   The slaying gained widespread attention during the White House
campaign when Byrne's father, Matthew, presented his son's badge to
George Bush, saying he supported him because of Bush's support of
the death penalty.
   Matthew Byrne, a former police officer, left the courtroom
without comment today.
   The sentencing of Scott and Cobb was postponed last month while
prosecutors tried unsuccessfully to persuade the two to provide
evidence against Mason.
   A fourth defendant, alleged triggerman David McClary, is on
trial in the slaying.

   Mourners bewailing the death of Iranian
patriarch Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini brought west Beirut to a
standstill today, but did not stop Christians and Syrians from
exchanging salvos of shellfire.
   Police said four Christian and five Druse Moslem civilians were
wounded in sporadic overnight shelling duels that ended before dawn.
   In an unrelated incident, gunmen shot and killed a Palestinian
employee of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency in
Syrian-policed west Beirut early today, police said.
   A police spokesman said Nafez Awdeh ``died instantly and the
gunmen sped away in a green Mercedes-Benz. UNRWA was notified.'' He
gave no other details.
   No comment was available immediately from the U.N. agency, which
cares for Palestinian refugees in the Middle East.
   Black flags and posters of Khomeini decorated Shiite Moslem
districts of Beirut and its southern slums.
   The 86-year-old Iranian patriarch died on Saturday of a heart
attack in Tehran after surgery for internal bleeding.
   Lebanese cranked up generators to watch Khomeini's funeral
broadcast live by the Lebanese Broadcasting Corp., run by
right-wing Christian militias. Three months of Syrian-Christian
clashes have caused chronic power shortages.
   Shiite mosques blared verses from the Koran, Islam's holy book,
as thousands of mourners flooded the Iranian Embassy to deliver
condolences.
   Cars mounted with loudspeakers drove the streets urging
businesses to close.
   ``Close! Close!'' shouted a bearded man from a car that flew the
Iranian flag and blared verses from the Koran as he drove across
west Beirut's Hamra commercial thoroughfare.
   ``Sure, sure,'' muttered a grocer, lowering his shutter.
   Banks and other private businesses that opened after observing a
one-day closure also shut down again.
   Meanwhile, police said the overnight casualties raised the toll
in the latest round of fighting in Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war
to 363 people killed and 1,430 wounded. The battles began on March
8 over a blockade Christian Gen. Michel Aoun imposed on illegal
ports run by Syrian-backed Moslem militias.
   A Arab League committee met for seven hours on Monday and made
yet another appeal for a cease-fire.
   King Hassan II of Morocco, King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and
President Chadli Bendjedid of Algeria make up the committee. The
league plans to dispatch a representative to Lebanon on Thursday to
pursue a cease-fire, said reports in Beirut's leftist newspaper
As-Safir and the independent daily An-Nahar.

<HEAD>Medical Branch to Halt Cosmetic Surgery for Prison Inmates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GALVESTON, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The University of Texas medical school
says it will put stricter limits on plastic surgery on inmates, two
years after the Legislature banned frivolous cosmetic surgery at
taxpayer expense.
   ``It is our intent to `limit down' so that we can stay out of
trouble with everybody,'' said Dr. Alvin L. LeBlanc, vice president
for hospital affairs. ``We are going to try to please the
Legislature, I can tell you that.''
   A rider to prison appropriations bills passed in 1987 and this
year prohibits use of state money for cosmetic surgery on prisoners
unless they are disfigured and suffer psychological problems
because of it.
   The university, a state school, operates a 120-bed prison
hospital in Galveston.
   The Houston Chronicle reported two months ago that hundreds of
prisoners over the years have gotten facelifts, liposuction _ fat
removal _ and other cosmetic surgery.
   The article quoted a 59-year-old inmate who received face and
brow lifts and liposuction as saying, ``I think it will help my
attitude and feeling about myself when I go back to the free
world.''
   School officials were quoted as saying that the practice helps
surgeons perfect their skills and improves prisoners' outlook.
   A prison policy that took effect April 28 requires that requests
for cosmetic surgery be approved by the deputy director for medical
services in the prison system and a university doctor, officials
said.
   In the past, prison psychiatrists could recommend the surgery.
   LeBlanc said he was unaware of the Legislature's limit on
cosmetic surgery until contacted by the Houston Chronicle on Monday.
   Jim Lynaugh, executive director of the Texas Department of
Corrections, said, ``We definitely were aware of that rider and
have not violated it.''
   ``When my inmates check into that hospital, I have no control of
anything except security. I don't control any medical practices in
that hospital,'' Lynaugh said.

   The timing couldn't have been better:
talent and technology coincided beautifully at the end of the 19th
century for controversial artist Aubrey Beardsley.
   Though little trained in art and just 25 when he died of
tuberculosis in 1898, the drawings Beardsley made the last six
years of his life are credited with influencing such giants of
20th-century art as Pablo Picasso, Paul Klee and Edvard Munch.
   Beardsley's black and white drawings, usually for book or
magazine illustrations, were printed _ when not suppressed _
through the then new photo-mechanical reproduction process, said
Miriam Stewart, a curatorial associate at Harvard University's Fogg
Art Museum. The reproductions were faithful to the drawings and
cost less than those carved into wood blocks by craftsmen rather
than the artist.
   The Fogg has more than 50 of the drawings, which were donated by
two alumni. They constitute the most important collection of the
artist's work outside Great Britain, said Fogg Curator of Drawings
William Robinson.
   For the first time in six years the drawings are on public
display, and for the first time in more than a dozen years, they
are together in one exhibit. And since the drawings are on paper,
making them delicate and sensitive to light, they can be exhibited
only briefly, museum officials said.
   They will be shown at Harvard's Sackler Museum through July 9
together with other material, including books illustrated by
Beardsley, loaned by Harvard's Houghton Library, the Boston Public
Library and Boston's Museum of Fine Arts.
   Some of the drawings are overtly erotic; others have touches
typical of his mischief.
   He usually started his drawings with pencil and perfected them
with ink, Stewart said. In some, he used graphite.
   His acquaintances included the playwright Oscar Wilde, and
Beardsley became a sensation with his illustrations for Wilde's
play, ``Salome,'' published in 1894. The illustraions were
``described variously as having nothing to do with the play and
everything to do with it,'' Stewart said.
   Included in the Fogg exhibit are two drawings intended for the
book but suppressed from publication.
   The show also includes work done for a reprint of Malory's ``Le
Morte d'Arthur,'' Ben Johnson's ``Volpone,'' Alexander Pope's ``The
Rape of the Lock,'' Aristophanes' ``Lysistrata,'' and for the
periodicals, The Yellow Book and The Savoy.
   Drawings for ``Bon-Mots,'' a collection of witticisms are ``sort
of elaborate doodles ... some quite grotesque,'' Stewart said.
   A voracious reader, Beardsley sometimes exchanged drawings for
books, and it was through this that his career was launched when he
was chosen to illustrate ``Le Morte d'Arthur.'' He was 20.
   Some drawings resemble posters and advertisements. ``He was of
his time, and he was not trying to create a lyrical past,'' Stewart
said.
   Beardsley began writing an erotic novel, but never completed it.
He became a Roman Catholic the year before he died, and on his
death bed asked that some of his drawings be destroyed. The
publisher who had them did not.
   The Fogg's collection came from alumni who had different reasons
for collecting Beardsley's work. Grenville L. Winthrop, who was
graduated in 1889 and who descended from the first governor of
Massachusetts, bequeathed to Harvard 23 original Beardsley drawings
among more than 3,700 art objects.
   Scofield Thayer, class of 1913 and onetime editor and part-owner
of the literary review The Dial, had more than 30 drawings that
became the Fogg's when he died.
   Winthrop liked the lines and design of Beardsley's work; Thayer
liked the daring subject matter, Robinson said.

<HEAD>Music Helped Spanish Tenor Live</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As the Spanish tenor Jose Carreras lay in a
Seattle hospital battling leukemia, music helped him to get through
the ordeal. Music, he says, ``has this spiritual strength.''
   ``Every day, I was listening to music with a Walkman in my
sterilized room. One of the pieces _ I had to hear it every day _
was Rachmaninoff's `Piano Concerto No. 2.' I was listening to many
versions of it, also Rachmaninoff playing it himself,'' said
Carreras who gave a recital at Carnegie Hall on May 25, his first
appearance in more than two years.
   ``The most important thing for me was to save my life. All the
rest came after this,'' he said.
   Carreras' leukemia is now in remission. ``Now I'm not under any
kind of treatment. I have a routine blood test once a month, that's
all. I travel around, I play some sports, I eat anything, drink
anything. There are no limitations in my life.''
   He makes long-range plans, including a co-production next year
between several European TV networks on the great opera singer
Enrico Caruso.
   Audiences are delighted as the 42-year-old Carreras makes his
``comeback'' recitals.
   He performed last July before 150,000 in Barcelona, and also
appeared in Vienna, at the Vatican and in other European cities.
This spring he was in Seattle, Washington and New York. In
February, he recorded Saint-Saens' ``Samson et Dalila'' and since
has recorded Halevy's ``La Juive'' for Philips. In July, he'll
return to opera, where he made his fame, singing in Barcelona in
Cherubini's ``Medea'' with soprano Montserrat Caballe.
   Carreras is ranked as one the top tenors in the world. But he
was often taken to task for vocal roughness, believed to be caused
by singing too often and singing roles too heavy for his voice, so
that he had to press for volume.
   ``Before, my career was the most important thing in my life,''
he said. ``Like anybody who succeeds, I had to fight a lot and have
a lot of discipline. Now, I'm more interested to have the
opportunity to sing on stage again and communicate with people
through my voice.''
   Carreras thinks his voice is essentially the same, but rested.
``I was lying in a hospital for nine months. It was a hard period.
But my vocal chords were resting. Thank God all the therapy and
treatments and radiation did not affect my vocal chords or mucous
membranes.
   ``Maybe as a singer I'm a little deeper or more mature. There is
a parallel between the artist and the human being.''
   He plans to include more lyrical roles in my repertoire as he
gets back to work. ``What is going to change for sure is the rhythm
of my career. I don't plan to sing more than three or four times in
one month and to have, if possible, a month of holiday every year.
   ``I'm going to enjoy not only my professional life, that is what
I did for 17 years, but to enjoy also the human side of my life
more than before,'' he said. Carreras has two children, Alberto,
15, and Julia, 10.
   ``I don't regret at all that I concentrated so much on my
profession. I had a wonderful life.''
   Carreras, who sang the part of Tony on the ``West Side Story''
record conducted by Leonard Bernstein, made the soundtrack for a
``La Boheme'' film in May 1987. That was when he fell ill.
   The diagnosis was acute lymphocytic leukemia. His doctors in
Spain recommended that he go to Seattle's Fred Hutchinson Cancer
Research Institute. Seattle also appealed to Carreras because he
felt he would be less of a media event there than in Europe.
   ``The treatment was bone marrow transplant. They took out my
bone marrow, treated it and gave it back to my body. This is a
revolutionary treatment which needs more and more research,'' he
said. To this end, the singer founded the Jose Carreras
International Foundation for the Prevention of Leukemia.
   ``It is unbelievable the thousands of letters, messages,
telegrams, phone calls,'' he said. ``This really touched me so
much. I think that gave me even more the strength to fight.''
   His next opera appearance after ``Medea'' will be in a new opera
about Columbus, which was postponed when he became sick. Now he'll
sing the title role in September in Barcelona. ``After this, I
think I will go back to opera in Vienna, Covent Garden, La Scala
and the Metropolitan Opera.''
   His time will be divided three ways, Carreras said, among
``singing new roles, new recitals, new recordings; free time _
pleasure, sports, friends; and the foundation _ meetings,
appointments, traveling, besides all the performances I give to
benefit the foundation. I have to tell you my life is quite busy
even though I sing less.
   ``I do everything with such a joy, you cannot imagine.''

   The five men and one woman have shared the
boarded-up South Bronx brownstone since 1983, their lives devoted
to drugs and crime.
   ``We're closer to each other than to our families,'' says Donna,
a crack addict who is undergoing methadone treatment to help fight
heroin addiction. ``We survive because we take care of each other.''
   Frank, 33, is the group leader. Hooked on heroin when he was 11,
the Bronx native has been in and out of methadone programs since he
was 18. The methadone blocks his appetite for heroin, but smoking
crack, a concentrated cocaine crystal, now satisfies his cravings
for a high.
   Albert, Michael and Fred are crack addicts, too. Kenny has a
heroin habit.
   The commune members have been evicted four times from the
building, which Michael's parents owned until the city seized it
for back taxes. The roof leaks and the ceilings are falling in. The
dank hallway reeks of urine. A rotting staircase leads to the
second-floor living area. A single bulb illuminates a semicircle of
mattresses that are beds by night and sofas by day. Old clothing is
stuffed in plastic bags or piled in corners. Frank's pit bull,
Coco, is kept chained to a radiator, a deterrent to unwanted
visitors.
   There is no heat or running water. The group members take sponge
baths using buckets filled with water taken from a hydrant outside.
A plastic pail is their toilet; it is emptied each morning into a
sewer pipe out on the street.
   Each member is responsible for raising the $1,000 a week it
takes to keep the group's drug habit satisfied. They're willing to
talk about their lives and crimes, they say, because they have
nothing to lose.
   Frank breaks into subway turnstiles and steals tokens. Each
token is worth $1 to a subway rider; newsstand operators and
convenience store owners in the Bronx pay him $75 for 100 tokens.
   ``It's a victimless crime. (We're) not hurting anybody. (We're)
taking back a little of what (we) gave the city,'' he says.
   But his crimes aren't always victimless.
   ``When we ran out of money we've looked at each other and said,
`Let's go hold up a taxi cab driver.' And we did.''
   Frank also deals crack. He pays $5 for a vial that holds less
than a quarter-teaspoon and sells it for $10. Some of his regular
customers include a Long Island gas station owner, a stockbroker, a
Manhattan free-lance artist, a former Amtrak motorman and a Xerox
customer service representative.
   Albert steals copper wire from Metro North commuter railroad
yards and sells it as scrap. He also strips copper wiring and pipes
from abandoned refrigerators and buildings, collects abandoned
mattresses and recycles bundles of unsold newspapers.
   Kenny describes himself as a ``real, real, real good thief.'' He
shoplifts, specializing in videotapes, electronic goods, medicines
and cigarettes. ``I take anything that ain't nailed down.''
   Donna's monthly welfare check goes for crack. ``The day her
welfare check comes in we lay in bed all day getting high,'' says
Frank.
   The group is not unaware of their condition.
   ``We're living like animals,'' Frank says. Since their most
recent eviction, in February, Frank has picked out two abandoned
buildings in the neighborhood in better condition that they can
move into.
   In addition, Donna expects to begin receiving her late husband's
Social Security benefits. He was a heroin addict who died in
December. Their 15-year-old son is in her parents' custody.
   She and Frank have been thinking of using the benefits to rent
an apartment to escape their squalid lifestyle.
   Albert is convinced he can break his crack addiction and
re-enter the mainstream. He has moved into a shelter for homeless
men and says, ``I'll be better in a few months, looking for a job.''
   Frank isn't so hopeful for himself and the others. ``Some of us
are beyond being saved. All of us somewhere in the back of our mind
have a death wish. We just don't have the courage to do it
outright.''

<HEAD>Floating Power Plant Starts Trip Up the Mississippi</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world's largest prefabricated, floating
power plant _ 25,000 tons, 12 stories high and 456 feet long _
began a slow, 208-mile journey up the Mississippi River today to
its work site.
   Pushed and pulled by six tugboats, the Merrimac headed for a
point 40 miles south of Vidalia, where it will be put in operation
on the west bank of the Mississippi.
   Louisiana's first hydroelectric plant will creep upriver at 2 to
4 mph, meaning a trip of two to four days, according to Merrimac
Corp., which commissioned the $500 million project. The plant will
serve Vidalia.
   About 75 people applauded as the Merrimac slipped away from the
docks at Avondale Shipyards.
   A highway bridge at Baton Rouge is expected to be the major
obstacle. The vessel will have to be pumped with ballast water and
sunk 40 to 50 feet to pass safely underneath.
   The Merrimac will divert water from the Mississippi through
eight giant turbines, creating 192 megawatts of electricity, enough
to light a city of 200,000.
   Owners of the power plant are Merrimac of New York and Dominion
Capital Inc. of Virginia.

<HEAD>Woman Goes To U.S. Supreme Court To Have Boyfriend Spend The Night</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A divorcee whose boyfriend was barred by
a judge from spending the night while her children were home has
taken her case to the nation's highest court.
   Carla J. Parrillo appealed to the Supreme Court on Monday,
arguing she was deprived of a ``fundamental right to be free from
government influence within the confines of her own home,'' said
her lawyer, Patrica A. Hurst of the American Civil Liberties Union.
   In a case initiated by Ms. Parrillo's former husband, Justin
Parrillo Jr., a Family Court judge ruled in 1986 that she may not
let her boyfriend stay over because the visits seemed to harm her
three children psychologically.
   The ruling by Judge William Goldberg was upheld in March by the
state Supreme Court.
   The Parrillos were divorced in 1986 and she was given custody of
the children, ages 9, 11 and 13 at the time.
   Ms. Parrillo maintained that overnight visits by boyfriend
Joseph DiPippo once or twice a week caused no harm to the children.
She testified they liked him.
   The children told the judge they got along well with DiPippo,
although the eldest said there were times he did not like the man.
   The judge found that if Ms. Parrillo married DiPippo, the issue
would become moot.

   Officials plan to ban drinking
outdoors in the wildest section of this liberal city to protect
residents and tourists from rowdy drunks, the government said
Tuesday.
   Under a new ordinance, drinking alcohol and possession of open
beverage containers outdoors will carry $25-dollar fines, said City
Hall spokeswoman Noortje van Oostveen.
   The area affected is Amsterdam's famed red light district in the
center of town, an area teaming with bars, prostitues, drug dealers
and crowds of astonished tourists.
   ``The alcoholics are becoming a nuisance to the people living
and working in the area, who're beginning to feel unsafe,'' Ms. Van
Oostveen said. ``We believe the ban will at least alleviate some of
the problems.''
   The law goes into effect June 9.

<HEAD>Mass Funeral For Senior PLO Official</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Dozens of riot police fired tear gas to
disperse Palestinians attending the funeral of a senior PLO
official today, and Israeli troops reportedly shot dead an Arab in
the occupied Gaza Strip.
   The army said it had no information on the clash in the village
of Beit Lahiya, where Arab doctors said one Palestinian was killed
and two were wounded, one seriously.
   Palestinian reporters said the clash broke out after troops
tried to reimpose a curfew on the village of 13,000 after
distributing new, computerized identity cards to residents. Arab
doctors identified the dead man as Jamil Hafez Suleiman, 22, and
said he was shot in the head.
   The death raised to 507 the number of Palestinians killed in the
18-month uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip. Twenty-two Israelis have also died.
   In Jerusalem, about 2,000 mourners waved outlawed Palestinian
flags at the funeral of Omar Qassem, 48, a senior figure in the
PLO's Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Qassem died
on Sunday.
   He spent 21 years in Israeli jails for his role in a 1968
guerrilla raid and had become a symbol for Palestinians held by
Israel.
   Israel radio said 20 Palestinians were detained following a
stone-throwing protest that broke out after the funeral, which
included a three-hour procession through Arab east Jerusalem.
   Reporters at the scene watched police fire tear gas to disperse
the demonstrators, who left the funeral shouting, ``We are the
fedayeen,'' or guerrillas in Arabic.
   Mourners vowed to increase their opposition to the occupation
and carried signs saying:``Escalating the Intefadeh will redeem
Omar Qassem's blood.'' Intefadeh is Arabic for uprising.
   Two Israeli-Arab legislators led the procession. One of them,
Abdel Wahab Daroushe, told the mourners after Qassem's body was
lowered into the grave: ``In spite of Israel's arrogance, the
intefadeh will be victorious.''
   In the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Palestinian shop keepers closed
their doors to mourn Qassem.
   The army maintained a curfew in the Gaza Strip for a third
straight day and began issuing computerized identity cards that
Palestinians will be required to carry to enter Israel. Arabs
detained for security reasons or convicted of serious crimes will
be denied the entry permits.
   The restrictions are designed to exert economic pressure on
Palestinian activists. About 50,000 Gazans work in Israel, and
there is little employment in the coastal strip.
   In Jerusalem, Foreign Minister Moshe Arens told 500 American
Jews visiting Israel he was surprised the United States would meet
with PLO officials on Thursday for a third round of talks since the
dialogue began in December.
   Everything the U.S. government does to ``give the PLO status and
legitimization is counterproductive and cannot possibly help
Israel's peace initiative,'' Arens said.
   Also today, police said Mayor Ron Nachmann of the Jewish West
Bank settlement of Ariel apparently did not break the law when he
ordered Arab laborers to wear badges identifying them as ``alien
workers.''
   The police official, speaking on condition of anonymity, would
not elaborate. The investigation will continue, he said.
   Nachmann backed down after the decision sparked widespread
criticism and raised comparisons to the yellow Stars of David that
Jews were forced to wear in Nazi Germany.

<TEXT>
   Joe Drodwill stood in cemetery
overlooking the sea on Tuesday, remembering the fellow soldiers who
fought and died there to free France from Nazi tyranny.
   ``It's like I'm reliving the war all over again, there are so
many memories,'' said the war veteran from Middletown, Conn., who
had not been back to the Normandy coast since the end of World War
II.
   About 1,000 people gathered by the reflecting pool at the
American military cemetery at Omaha Beach on Tuesday, the 45th
anniversary of the invasion. Among them was a large group of
gray-haired veterans from the United States.
   The ceremony at the cemetery was one of several over three days
by British, Canadian, French and U.S. groups to mark Tuesday's
anniversary. At Bayeux, Queen Mother Elizabeth of Britain dedicated
a stained-glass window in the cathedral in honor of the fallen
soldiers.
   Canadian Veterans Affairs Minister Gerald S. Merrithew joined in
commemorations at the Canadian cemetery at Beny sur Mer.
   Drodwill was in a group of 225 U.S. Army Rangers who just after
dawn on June 6, 1944, scaled the 9-story high cliff at Point du Hoc
on Omaha Beach using grappling hooks and ladders to reach the big
German guns above.
   Nazi soldiers fired straight down on them, cutting the ropes to
send many Rangers plummeting to their deaths.
   ``I couldn't sleep last night, I kept thinking of the beach,''
said Drodwill, who lost four men under his command during the
assault.
   Surrounded by a group of veteran Rangers, Drodwill cried softly
as a single bugle played taps, the melancholy notes lofting over
the manicured green lawn lined with 9,368 white marble crosses.
   The sun emerged and warmed the crowd, damp from standing in
heavy morning showers. A military band played the Star Spangled
Banner and the Marseillaise.
   Four F-16s flew low over the sparkling English Channel and the
cemetery that overlooks a long, curving beach where American troops
stormed ashore to drive back German forces in what was the
beginning of the end of Adolf Hitler's tyranny.
   The Germans, in trenches and concrete bunkers perched on the
bluff 150 feet above the beach, shot at the wide-open Yanks as they
struggled onto the beach, stumbling knee-deep, hip-deep, neck-deep
through the surf, some of them shot to death before ever touching
shore.
   ``I lost one in the water,'' said Drodwill, 68. ``He went down
under the weight of his gear and never came up.''
   The dead and wounded were sprawled everywhere, their blood
soaking into the sand.
   ``Some of my men fell, but there were so many others, all around
me, all Americans, all young. That's the picture in my head I can't
get rid of,'' Drodwill said.
   Up and down a 50-mile stretch of Normandy coast, 180,000 U.S.,
British and Canadian soldiers battled on Utah, Gold, Juno and Sword
Beaches in operation Overlord, the largest amphibious operation in
history.
   With reinforcements, the assault force numbered 3 million men.
   Compared to the relatively light American casualties at Utah,
Omaha was the roughest of the fighting. It took all day for the 1st
and 29th Infantry Divisions to cross 250 yards of sand and rock and
climb onto the bluff where the 172-acre military cemetery now
stands as a memorial to those who fought and died.
   ``I don't usually cry,'' Drodwill said. ``Maybe this trip will
help soften the memory.''

   President Bush, amid praise for Pakistani
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's efforts to aid the Afghan
resistance, pledged today to join her in exploring ``any serious
avenue'' to a political solution to the bloody conflict in
Afghanistan.
   ``Prime Minister Bhutto and I reviewed the situation in
Afghanistan. ... We agreed ... that the job is not done,'' Bush
said of the Afghan rebels' struggle to topple the Marxist regime in
Kabul.
   The two leaders met for an hour with the Afghan situation the
centerpiece of their discussions.
   Although many U.S. officials had expected the Soviet-backed
Kabul regime to fall shortly after the withdrawl of Red Army troops
in February, the rebel forces have been unable to topple the regime
of Najibullah. That has forced the administration to reconsider its
strategy in the troubled region.
   Pakistan, the third largest recipient of U.S. aid, has
cooperated closely with the United States in aiding the Afghan
rebel effort to topple the Kabul government.
   Bush said he and Mrs. Bhutto had ``discussed ways to encourage a
political solution in Afghanistan that will lead to a non-aligned,
representative government ... to replace the illegitimate regime in
Kabul.
   ``The United States and Pakistan will continue to explore any
serious avenue towards this end.''
   Mrs. Bhutto, in her departure remarks, called her talks with
Bush ``instructive and fruitful,'' adding in regards to the Afghan
situation, ``we are in complete accord with future policies.''
   ``Pakistan remains fully committed ot a politcal solution'' in
Afghanistan, she said.
   Earlier, the two leaders exchanged warm remarks during the
formal welcoming ceremony, held under leaden grey skies on the
South Lawn of the White House.
   Bush pledged to ``chart new ways to strengthen old bonds'' with
Pakistan, greeting Mrs. Bhutto as the living symbol of the renewal
of democracy in her strategic nation.
   ``The day of the dictator is over,'' declared Mrs. Bhutto.
   The president noted that they are both new in their posts.
   ``Let us craft new ideas, new initiative to meet the challeges
of a changing world,'' Bush said.
   He described Mrs. Bhutto as ``a living symmbol of those who risk
all and sacrifice much so that others might know democracy and
freedom.''
   Attired in a traditional white shawl, tunic and pants, the prime
minister replied that she came to Washington to begin ``discussions
of a new relationship'' as both nations work to meet the ``new
challenges (that) confront us in the closing but complex phase of
the Afghan war.''
   The Washington Post reported today that the Bush administration
is considering the sale of 60 F-16 fighter jets to Pakistan at a
cost of $1.4 billion, but the two leaders made no mention of any
such agreement in their welcoming remarks.
   While Bush did not mention the ongoing Afghan rebel effort in
his initial remarks, he repeatedly praised Mrs. Bhutto's battle to
return her nation to democratic rule. She assumed her duties six
months ago following her party's victory in national elections.
   Mrs. Bhutto said the two nations have ``stood together as
partners'' in the attempt to restore freedom and independence to
Afghanistan.
   ``Our countries have developed a vital security relationship and
a major program of economic cooperation. This has enabled Pakkistan
to work with confidence for peace in our region,'' she said.
   ``It was not so long ago that Pakistan was a dictatorship and I
was in prison. But, as you said Mr. President, giving heart to all
those living under tyrany, the day of the dictator is over,'' she
said.
   After the welcoming ceremony and a meeting in the Oval Office,
Mrs. Bhutto was to be the guest of honor at a State Department
luncheon hosted by Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   A White House state dinner was planned this evening following
meetings Mrs. Bhutto had scheduled at the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund.
   During her two-day stay, agreements in the areas of narcotics
control, housing and education are to be signed. Also on the agenda
is the U.S. aid program for Pakistan, for which the administration
has requested $380 million in economic assistance and $240 million
in military transfers for the next fiscal year. Pakistan is the
third largest recipient of U.S. aid.
   But the principal focus of attention of her visit will be the
unending civil war in Afghanistan, a conflict in which the United
States and Pakistan have cooperated for years.
   Although the Soviet Union completed the withdrawal of its forces
in February, Pakistan is still bearing the burden of 3 million
Afghan refugees as fighting continues between the Marxist
government in Kabul and the Afghan rebels. The insurgents have been
using Pakistan as a launching pad for attacks inside Afghanistan.
   In recent interviews, Mrs. Bhutto has indicated a desire for a
political settlement. But she accepts the U.S. view that any such
agreement should not include Afghanistan's current leader,
Najibullah, whose forces have proved remarkably resilient in the
face of predictions his government would collapse following the
Soviet withdrawal. Pakistan.

   David Duke, ex-Ku Klux Klan leader
turned ambitious freshman legislator, riled some people with his
election, but during his first regular lawmaking session he has
hardly made a dent in Louisiana government.
   With the 1989 general session nearing its end, none of his bills
has made it through the legislative process. Only one was passed by
the House and it is pending in a Senate committee.
   ``Some of my legislation's gone through. I mean I'm only a
two-month freshman legislator and I think I've done quite well,''
Duke said.
   It's not unusual for a newcomer to have difficulty getting
legislation passed. Rep. James St. Raymond had a similar experience
last year.
   ``The major difference is David is sort of a one-issue type of
guy. He's interested in the racial issue,'' St. Raymond said.
   The legislative session could end as early as this weekend.
   Duke, 38, was elected in February to represent a nearly
all-white district in suburban New Orleans after a ``no-tax''
campaign that focused on ``civil rights'' for everyone _ including
whites.
   Duke is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, which he left
in 1980 in a dispute with a rival faction. He then formed the
National Association for the Advancement of White People, which he
still heads.
   He ran for president in 1988, first as a Democrat and then on
the Populist Party ticket. He registered as a Republican days
before entering the House race, which he won by 227 votes in a
runoff with a long-time Republican who was endorsed by President
Bush and former President Reagan.
   Republican National Committee Chairman Lee Atwater called for
Duke's censure as a charlatan after the election.
   A challenge to his seating in the Legislature fizzled when 69 of
102 lawmakers backed him. Several representatives said they were
inundated with calls from constituents across the state insisting
that Duke be seated.
   When the regular session began in April, Duke offered nine bills
which would, among other things, have eliminated affirmative action
and minority set asides and required drug testing for housing
project residents and welfare recipients.
   One Duke bill is dead on the House floor. One is pending in a
Senate committee. A third was gutted in committee and sent to the
House floor, where it was shelved. Six languish in House committees
and are not expected to get out.
   Seated at one end of the back row of desks, Duke is not one of
the plentiful lower chamber gadflies. He rarely goes to the
microphone to speak on others' bills.
   Duke's legislation seems to be a target for procedural
torpedoes, including one fired by Rep. Mitch Landrieu, a young
white legislator whose district includes a housing project.
Landrieu got the House to table Duke's bill to scrap affirmative
action laws.
   ``It was a short House and they just happened to get two switch
votes which made a difference on that particular vote,'' Duke said.
``What Mitch Landrieu did is he robbed the people of the right to
hear the points of view and really have equal rights on this
matter. We must have equal rights in this state for everybody.''
   Another Duke bill, to deny welfare benefits to drug users by
requiring them to be tested, was weakened in a House committee to
affect only welfare recipients convicted of drug crimes. It is
awaiting debate by the full House.
   The bill in the Senate committee would require teen-agers to
pass drug tests to get driver's licenses, but it was gutted by
amendments offered by a black legislator, Rep. C.D. Jones.
   ``It's a unique situation. He's sort of an internationally known
fellow and that puts added pressure on him ... to get a lot
accomplished,'' St. Raymond said. ``I told him he could work within
the Republican Caucus _ `We'll give you a chance or you can go off
and set your agenda.' He's kind of gone off on his own.''
   But Duke said he believes his presence has made a difference.
   ``I think I've pushed the whole House of Representatives more to
the issues of the middle class and more to the issues of my agenda,
my campaign agenda, which is equal rights for all and reform of the
welfare system,'' Duke said. ``I think we're moving along quite
well.''

<HEAD>Congressman Questions Company's $65 Million in Subsidies</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department was asked Tuesday
to investigate a grain company with possible ties to a fugitive
businessman in Switzerland and whether the business had properly
received $65 million in export subsidies.
   The chairman of a House Agriculture subcommittee, Rep. Dan
Glickman, D-Kan., called for the review of Richco Grain, a
Swiss-based company with an office in Stamford, Conn., and payments
it received through the export enhancement program.
   Glickman said USDA needs to focus on the company's connections
to Marc Rich, who renounced his U.S. citizenship and fled to
Switzerland in 1983 before his indictment for criminal tax evasion,
racketeering, mail and wire fraud.
   ``While I am disturbed that a company whose main operations lie
outside of the United States can establish but a nominal onshore
presence and qualify to receive EEP bonuses, as appears to be the
case with Richco Grain, I am truly shocked that a fugitive from
U.S. justice can benefit from a program funded by taxpayer
dollars,'' Glickman said in a letter to Agriculture Secretary
Clayton Yeutter.
   Under the export enhancement program, or EEP, private exporters
can sell U.S. commodities at lower prices to meet foreign
competition and then collect free government surpluses of grain or
other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies.
   Richard Crowder, under secretary for international affairs and
commodity programs, said he had not seen the congressman's letter
but that USDA had already started ``checking through what the
connections are'' between Richco and Rich. He said the review was
started to answer questions raised by Glickman about Richco at a
subcommittee hearing in April.
   An official of Richco, Al Church, declined comment about the
USDA review and would not provide any information about the company.
   Glickman, in his letter, said ``an unmistakable line of
ownership, control and profit runs from'' Richco Grain to Rich
through a series of subsidiary arrangements.
   He asked that USDA's inspector general determine whether Richco
had qualified for the export subsidy program and whether department
eligibility guidelines need to be changed to close any possible
loopholes used by Richco.
   ``I believe that especially in this case, the department should
take special care to determine whether Rich's benefit from the EEP
program, through Richco Grain, was camouflaged through subsidiary
arrangements with other business entities he owns and controls,''
Glickman wrote. ``In short, has Rich and Richco Grain complied with
the letter of the law but flouted its spirit?''
   Richco has the same telephone number as Clarendon AG, a U.S.
subsidiary of Marc Rich &amp; Co. A.G. of Switzerland. The two
companies settled a federal tax evasion case in 1984 by pleading
guilty and agreeing to pay more than $200 million in back taxes,
fines and other penalties.
   Criminal charges against Rich were unaffected by the settlement.
The government alleged that Rich and his commodity-trading empire
cheated the U.S. Treasury out of millions of dollars in taxes
through a series of illegal oil transactions among Rich-controlled
companies.
   According to Glickman, Richco has received about $65 million
worth of subsidies through EEP, including about $250,000 for a
recent wheat sale to the Soviet Union.
   Last month, President Bush approved use of the subsidy program
for the sale of 1.5 million tons of wheat to the Soviets. Richco
handled at least 30,000 tons of the initial part of the wheat deal.
Subsidies averaged $8.46 per ton for Richco and four other
companies, according to USDA.

   Solidarity said today that despite its
overwhelming victory in parliamentary elections it will not accept
the Communist Party's offer to join a governing coalition.
   In a conciliatory move, however, the free trade union movement
offered to stand by the agreement made with authorities in April
and allow the party the two-thirds majority in Parliament's
powerful lower house.
   Up to 35 of those seats may be vacant because high party and
government officials such as Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski
appeared to have been defeated in Sunday's vote despite running
unopposed.
   Rakowski will offer his resignation and that of his Cabinet when
the new parliament convenes in June, said deputy government
spokesman Zbyslaw Rykowski.
   Voters disgruntled by the Communists' more than 40 years of
authoritarian rule and mismanagement of the economy gave few of the
high-ranking officials the majority needed to gain seats.
   Solidarity won an overwhelming majority of seats to the new
100-member Senate and virtually all the 161 seats it was permitted
in the lower house, or Sejm, according to unofficial returns. A
handful of seats may be decided in runoffs on June 18.
   On Monday, the party conceded defeat in what was Poland's most
democratic balloting in more than four decades, but fears were
raised that the outcome could precipitate a new political crisis.
The result gave an opposition group in Eastern Europe control of a
freely chosen chamber of Parliament for the first time since the
postwar Communist takeover.
   The Communists have urged Solidarity to join a governing
coalition, an arrangement unprecedented in the Soviet bloc.
   ``We cannot do reforms by ourselves. ... We need each other,''
Rykowski said today.
   He declined to be specific, saying such questions would have to
wait until the new parliament is seated.
   At a news conference today, Solidarity spokesman Janusz
Onyszkiewicz said the union considers itself bound by the April
accords in which it agreed to give the government a majority in the
460-member Sejm _ 299 seats.
   Authorities should thus be allowed to fill the vacant seats as
they please, he said.
   Onyszkiewicz ruled out a formal governing coalition: ``All
candidates for deputy and senator stated that they will enter the
Sejm or Senate as the opposition. That was made very clear.''
   But he said that did not rule out future ``joint actions and
joint decisions'' to solve specific problems.
   Senior Solidarity adviser Bronislaw Geremek told reporters the
union was ready to act jointly with the government to work for
reform.
   Onyszkiewicz praised Monday's statement by Communist Party
spokesman Jan Bisztyga, who acknowledged the party's electoral
defeat.
   ``It was a very important statement because it shows that the
government and the party are committed to a peaceful transition
from the present political situation to a more democratic
situation,'' he said.
   Solidarity wants totally free elections in four years, without
any pre-reserved seats for either side.
   Jubilant union supporters celebrated their election win with
Russian champagne into the night Monday at Warsaw campaign
headquarters.
   Although final official results were not expected until midweek,
voters rejected government-backed candidates nearly everywhere.
   Poland's leader, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, on Friday suggested a
post-election ``grand coalition,'' though no specific explanations
have been given of what he intended.
   Solidarity's victory was shocking in its proportions for the
authorities.
   Leading officials likely failing to win the necessary votes for
a seat in Parliament include Interior Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak and
eight of the ruling Politburo's 17 members, including No. 2 Jozef
Czyrek.
   Though rejected, the government officials are allowed to keep
their posts. In his dramatic concession of defeat Monday, Bisztyga
acknowledged on television a ``decided majority'' for Solidarity
and appealed for calm.
   With or without a formal coalition of Solidarity and the
Communist leadership that long sought to crush it, it appeared
certain the two would have to cooperate.
   The government needs Solidarity if it is to end a protracted
economic crisis that includes 80 percent inflation that last year
touched off a series of crippling strikes. The country has a $39
billion foreign debt.
   The Solidarity-controlled Senate will have veto power over all
legislation, and could only be overridden by a two-thirds majority
in the Sejm.
   But with at best a 65 percent majority of the Sejm seats, the
Communist Party and its allies would need at least 10 Solidarity
votes in the lower house to override a veto.
   The Sejm and Senate are required to convene after June 18 to
elect the president, a new office the Communists had hoped to award
to Jaruzelski through a majority in the Sejm.

   A New York City art dealer testified today
that Peg Goldberg ``left no stone unturned'' in her attempt last
summer to learn whether four sixth-century Christian mosaics
offered for sale were stolen.
   ``I think her inquiry met the best professional standards,''
said Andre Emmerich, owner of Andre Emmerich Gallery.
   Goldberg's ownership of the mosaics is being challenged by the
Republic of Cyprus and its Greek Orthodox Church, who claim the
works were stolen from a church in northern Cyprus and smuggled out
of the Mediterranean island nation.
   They are asking a federal judge to order the suburban
Indianapolis dealer to return the mosaics.
   On Monday, Goldberg testified she believed the man who sold her
the four mosaics obtained them legally. She also said she made
inquiries around the world to see if any claims had been made
against the art.
   Emmerich, a witness for Goldberg, said in a videotaped
deposition that comparing her with international dealers would be
like comparing ``the corner store to Bloomingdale's.'' But he said
her investigation of the mosaics before she purchased them was as
complete as any more-experienced dealer would have made.
   ``I couldn't have expected more. She left no stone unturned,''
he said.
   He said the International Foundation for Art Research, which
Goldberg contacted by telephone, is considered the most complete
and readily available source on stolen artwork.
   The mosaics, which are believed to date to 525 A.D., depict
Jesus Christ as an adolescent, the apostles James and Matthew and
an archangel. They are among only a handful of icons surviving from
the first centuries of Christianity.
   Goldberg on Monday testified she believed Aydin Dikmen, who sold
her the mosaics, had been an archaeologist for the Turkish Republic
of Northern Cyprus. She said she did not know the breakaway
government is not recognized by the United States.
   She said she was told ``that in the process of his other duties,
he had found these pieces, that he had been able to make
application to acquire them and that had subsequently been granted
by the government.''
   Goldberg testified she called customs officials in the United
States, Switzerland, Germany and Turkey and found no claims against
the mosaics.
   She said she also called UNESCO in Switzerland and the
International Foundation for Art Research, which keeps an inventory
of stolen art.
   She did not ask UNESCO if the mosaics were stolen, only whether
any treaties would prevent her from bringing them to the United
States, and was told no, she testified.
   Goldberg said she asked the art foundation whether it had any
record of the mosaics being reported stolen and was told no.
   UNESCO and several other international art groups did have
reports that the mosaics were stolen.
   On cross-examination by attorney Thomas R. Kline, Goldberg said
she could not recall the names of the people she talked to.

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A house on Detroit's west side apparently is
getting no R-E-S-P-E-C-T from singer Aretha Franklin.
   The two-story brick home, deeded to the singer in 1972 by her
then-husband Theodore White, was condemned last year by the city.
Now, the yard is overgrown and littered with fliers, and there is a
hole in the screen door.
   ``We live in a nice neighborhood, but Aretha Franklin doesn't
care about us,'' said Theodora Stewart, a neighbor behind the house.
   Franklin, who lives in Bloomfield Hills, couldn't be reached for
comment. There was no answer this morning at the office of her
attorney, Harvey Tennen.
   City records show the house was bought by White and Franklin for
$18,500 in 1967, when they were married. The market value of the
house and land is about $42,500.

<HEAD>Appeal Set For Nation's First DNA-Convicted Serial Killer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE TAYLOR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A scientific test that has found growing
use in court to identify crime suspects through genetic patterns in
body cells will be challenged this week in the appeal of a man who
faces four death sentences.
   Timothy W. Spencer, 26, a former resident of a Richmond halfway
house, was the first defendant in a serial-murder case in the
nation to be confronted with so-called ``DNA fingerprinting''
evidence at his trials.
   DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid, is the basic genetic material found
in each cell of the human body and forms the blueprint for each
individual. Everyone's DNA pattern is believed to be unique, with
the exception of identical twins.
   Spencer was convicted and sentenced to death in separate trials
last year for the rape-murders of Susan M. Tucker, 44, of
Arlington, and Debbie Dudley Davis, 35, of Richmond.
   This year, he was convicted and sentenced to die in two other
cases, the rape-murders of Dr. Susan Elizabeth Hellams, 32, of
Richmond, and Diane Cho, 15, of Chesterfield County.
   All four victims were bound and strangled by an assailant who
broke into their homes through a window.
   In each case, DNA from a sample of semen found at the crime
scene was compared to DNA patterns in Spencer's blood cells. The
results linked him to the murders.
   The genetic evidence was challenged by defense lawyers at
Spencer's trials, but the judges allowed the test results in each
case.
   Although the DNA test, developed in England, is relatively new,
Bert Rohrer, a spokesman for Attorney General Mary Sue Terry, said
courts are likely to uphold such a test if it is determined to be
reliable.
   At Spencer's trial for the Davis murder, experts testified that
the DNA patterns found in the defendant's blood and in the semen
sample found with the victim matched. The odds of finding such a
match randomly was one in 705 million, they testified.
   But Jeffery L. Everhart, a Richmond attorney who represented
Spencer in the Davis killing, argued that the DNA procedure is too
unproved to be relied upon exclusively, as it was in that and the
other cases, to put the defendant at the scene of the crime.
   Defense lawyers argued that the procedure's reliability may come
into question in future research on forensic evidence.
   On Thursday, the Virginia Supreme Court will hear challenges to
the DNA evidence and other issues that arose in Spencer's trials
for the Tucker and Davis murders.
   The appeals went to the high court on automatic review, a
standard procedure when anyone is sentenced to execution in
Virginia. Spencer's appeals in the Hellams and Cho murders will be
heard later.
   Spencer also was linked to a fifth murder. But Arlington County
Commonwealth's Attorney Helen Fahey said Spencer would not be
charged in that slaying because DNA testing of the aging evidence
was inconclusive.
   Another man, David Vasquez, was sentenced to a 35-year prison
term for that killing after pleading guilty to first-degree murder
but was pardoned by Gov. Gerald L. Baliles when new evidence came
to light.

<HEAD>Mock Invasion Of Duluth Beach Canceled After Protests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DULUTH, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy has canceled plans for an
amphibious assault on a Duluth beach during a goodwill recruiting
visit this summer because of protests by peace activists, city
council members and others.
   Opponents had threatened to meet the Marine landing force on the
beach with an army of protesters.
   However, the Navy said it hasn't canceled mock landings at five
other Great Lakes cities as part of a 21-city Great Lakes
recruiting tour. ``As far as I know, Duluth is the only place in
the Great Lakes where we've met opposition,'' said Navy Chief Petty
Officer Steven Fiebing.
   He said the USS Boulder still will dock in Duluth on July 21 so
people can tour the ship.
   ``I spent a horrible weekend watching the news from China. It's
nice to know we can communicate with our military,'' said City
Council President Joyce Benson.
   Not everyone was happy.
   ``There was more opposition to this than the invasion of
Grenada,'' said Dan Russell, head of the Duluth Convention and
Visitors Bureau, which helped organize the event. He said the
landing would have been a ``great opportunity for us to sell the
fact that Duluth has seven miles of beautiful beach.''
   Original plans called for 200 Marines in amphibious tanks to
storm ashore and ``capture'' a beach house on Minnesota Point, a
narrow strip of land that separates Duluth Harbor and Superior Bay
from Lake Superior.
   But at least a dozen religious and peace groups said such an
exercise glorified violence and war and was not an appropriate way
to recruit the city's young people, and they planned a group of
protesters to defend the beach.
   The Navy said it was not swayed, but relented after Benson
telephoned some top Navy officials and Council Member Frank Jewell
threatened to introduce a resolution opposing the use of the beach
for the landing.
   ``The resolution would say there are a number of ordinances that
prohibit such things as the use of firearms or motorized vehicles
from the beach,'' said Jewell.
   ``They probably just assumed a permit wouldn't be necessary. The
military usually doesn't apply for a permit to storm beaches,''
Russell said.
   Other cities where amphibious landings are scheduled are
Cleveland; Michigan City, Ind.; Lorain, Ohio; Erie, Pa., and
Rochester, N.Y.

<HEAD>`Onion Field' Killer's Arrest Is Latest in Long String</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST COVINA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Onion Field'' police killer Jimmy
Lee Smith was in jail without bail Tuesday on charges of
terrorizing a woman, the latest in a string of run-ins with the law
since he was paroled in 1982.
   Smith, 58, was being held for investigation of false
imprisonment, attempted rape and assault with a deadly weapon,
police said Tuesday.
   Smith and Gregory Powell were convicted of kidnapping two Los
Angeles policemen in March 1963 and driving them to an onion field
south of Bakersfield, where Powell shot one officer to death and
wounded his partner.
   The crime was recounted in former Los Angeles policeman Joseph
Wambaugh's best-selling novel, ``The Onion Field,'' which was made
into a movie. Powell and Smith were twice sentenced to death for
the killing, but the sentences were overturned on appeal.
   Smith was paroled in February 1982 after serving 19 years at
Soledad Correctional Facility. A few months later, he was back in
prison for six months after failing a drug test and not telling his
parole officer he was leaving the Los Angeles area.
   Two years later, he was convicted in Los Angeles of selling
heroin while on parole and was sentenced to five years in prison.
He served 2{ years and was released in 1986.
   Police Lt. Lee Rossman said Smith is accused of holding a
36-year-old woman against her will over the weekend and of
assaulting and attempting to rape her. Powell is serving a life
term and was denied parole last year.

   A car thief spent the weekend in jail
completing a sentence. Actually, 10,000 or so sentences.
   Timothy Loggins, 20, had been ordered to write ``If I don't own
it, I won't take it'' 10,000 times.
   ``I want him to feel that this repetitive writing is about as
foolish as what he did,'' said Municipal Judge D. Ronald Hyde. ``I
want people to know that if you steal, you're going to pay a price,
and it isn't always jail.''
   Loggins was released Monday after producing a thick batch of
yellow, legal-size paper. The judge's clerk, Beverly Delucchi, said
the last few hundred lines appeared to be written in a hand
suffering from writer's cramp.
   Asked if the judge counted the sentences, Delucchi said, ``I
don't know. I know I didn't.''
   Loggins pleaded guilty last year, and Hyde sentenced him to five
weekends in jail and ordered him to write the sentence as part of
his probation. The judge jailed Loggins after learning he had not
done his homework.

<TEXT>
   Americans gave $104 billion to charity last
year, almost 7 percent more than 1987 and 1.8 percent ahead of the
inflation rate, according to a report Tuesday by the American
Association of Fund-Raising Counsel.
   The association, which represents fund-raising counseling firms,
said the total was up $6.55 billion over 1987, breaking the $100
billion mark for the first time.
   Individuals provided about $87 billion, foundations $6 billion
and businesses $4.8 billion. Bequests _ gifts willed by the
deceased _ amounted to $6.8 billion.
   Religious institutions and causes received the largest share of
donations, $48 billion, with education, health and human services
and cultural organizations getting most of the balance.
   The association attributed the increase in giving to a 7.5
percent increase in personal income as well as a stronger stock
market in the last two months of 1988.

<TEXT>
   Democratic Gov. Rose Mofford vetoed a $3.2
billion budget from the Republican-controlled Legislature and
demanded that Democrats get a greater say.
   The veto, unprecedented in state history, came Monday on the
148th day of what was supposed to be a 100-day session and left the
state without a spending plan for the fiscal year that begins July
1.
   Republican legislative leaders agreed to meet with Democrats and
said they would suspend most other business for the week.
   Conservative lawmakers said the veto might backfire on Mrs.
Mofford if it prompted them to reopen budgets for agencies for
which she already had gotten what she wanted.
   In a radio address, Mrs. Mofford said the GOP plan was at least
$165 million out of balance, ``does not meet or adequately fund our
moral and legal obligations'' and ``undermines the economic future
of the state by defaulting on investments that need to be made.''
   The budget was put together on an ``exclusively partisan basis''
with the 90-member Legislature's 39 Democrats left on the
sidelines, she said.
   Mrs. Mofford's spending proposal calls for $86 million to $116
million more in overall spending than the GOP plan, and puts
different amounts of money into some areas.
   Mrs. Mofford's budget seeks about $40 million for employee pay
raises, while the Legislature wants to spend $17.8 million, for
example. And it proposes $22 million more in welfare agency
spending than the GOP plan.
   The GOP plan represents an 11 percent increase over this year's
spending. Some Republicans criticized Mrs. Mofford for vetoing the
full budget, instead of just the items she objected to, adding that
she had not played a major role in budget talks apart from putting
out an official proposal in January as part of her State of the
State message.
   ``She reminds me of groundhog day,'' said Sen. Leo Corbet. ``She
came out and gave the State of the State, and saw her shadow and we
haven't seen her since.''
   No other governor in Arizona's history has vetoed a full budget,
according to the House clerk's office.
   ``I think of all of the options the governor had available to
her, she selected the worst one,'' said Senate majority leader John
Mawhinney.
   ``If the governor was unhappy with either the revenue package or
the budget, then what we needed was clear indication of what it is
that she felt she couldn't live with,'' he added.

<TEXT>
   Banking groups lined up Tuesday to oppose
legislation that would require financial institutions to cash
government checks for non-customers and offer low-cost savings or
checking accounts.
   The bankers told the Senate Banking subcommittee on consumer and
regulatory affairs that banks have been doing a good job of
voluntarily meeting the needs of the poor and elderly and should
not have new government requirements imposed on them as proposed by
Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio.
   ``How can it make sense for Washington to mandate one rigid
approach which is supposed to meet the needs of all our diverse
communities?'' asked American Bankers Association representative
Robert L. Stevens, president of the Bryn Mawr Trust Co. in
Pennsylvania.
   But officials of organizations representing consumers and the
elderly told the panel that financial institutions ought to be
ashamed to argue against government involvement at a time when
Congress is considering a $300 billion rescue of the savings and
loan industry.
   ``Banking lobbyists have often stated that the banking industry
is a private enterprise and should not be looked on as having to
fill any given public purpose,'' said Peggy Miller of the Consumer
Federation of America. ``Such an assumption made in the face of the
astronomical costs to the public of the S&amp;L bailout is
indefensible.''
   Metzenbaum had originally tried to enact his proposals by
attaching them to the S&amp;L bailout bill passed by the Senate April
19, but he backed off after Sen. Alan J. Dixon, D-Ill., chairman of
the subcommittee, promised him a hearing.
   Dixon said he was keeping an open mind on the proposals and
would decide ``in a month or so'' whether to begin moving them
through the legislative process.
   One of Metzenbaum's bills would require banks and S&amp;Ls to cash
government checks, such as welfare and Social Security payments, of
up to $1,500 for non-customers with proper identification. The
institutions would be permitted to cover their costs through a low
fee set by the Federal Reserve.
   The second measure would require financial institutions to offer
low-cost accounts with a minimum balance of $25 and a maximum
balance of $1,000. The institutions would have to provide monthly
statements and permit up to 10 checks or withdrawals a month.
   ``This is not drastic or draconian legislation. It's a very
modest proposal,'' he said.
   However, banking groups complained they would suffer losses from
fraud if denied the right to refuse to cash a check.
   The ABA said a survey showed that more than half of all banks
and three-quarters of large banks already offer low-cost basic
accounts and 80 percent cash government checks for non-customers.
As an alternative to mandated check-cashing, the bankers advocated
expanding government programs to directly deposit checks into bank
accounts.
   But consumer groups and the American Association of Retired
Persons said low-income people often can't afford bank accounts and
are forced to rely on expensive check-cashing services. Also, the
AARP said many elderly people were suspicious of direct deposits,
believing their money could be misdirected.
   Miller said the industry's claim that more than half of all
banks offer low-cost accounts is flawed because they too broadly
define low-cost. She said only one in four banks offers checking
accounts with a $3 or less monthly fee.
   The Senate panel is holding another hearing Wednesday on a third
Metzenbaum proposal that would require banks and S&amp;Ls to make
public their record of serving poor and minority neighborhoods.
   Other banking groups opposing Metzenbaum are the Independent
Bankers Association of America and the Consumer Bankers Association.

   Jim Wright sat alone over a draft of his
resignation speech, while nearby in the Capitol, House Majority
Leader Tom Foley hosted a breakfast meeting with Bush
administration budget officers.
   All around him last week, ambitious Democrats were scrambling
for support in House leadership races, but not Foley. ``I was not
going to campaign for an office for which there was no vacancy,''
he would say later.
   Tuesday, just after noon, the man from Spokane, Wash., filled
the vacancy. Wright was out as Speaker of the House. Foley was in.
   Throughout the turmoil over Wright's political demise, Foley
went out of his way to conduct business as usual. Budget meetings,
funerals, a ride down Main Street _ he kept to a normal schedule
during an extraordinary week.
   ``It was a very very wrenching time,'' he says now. ``I would
have hoped if I had a chance to become speaker, it would have
happened through the normal succession.''
   His activities during this unusual succession may provide a hint
of his leadership style in the House. Publicly, Foley worked to
keep the House moving on a legislative agenda that slipped badly
over the past several months. Privately, he played a quiet,
behind-the-scenes role in the tumultuous events.
   Some Democrats urged Foley, 60 years old and a 25-year veteran
of the House, to distance himself from the wounded speaker. He
refused, telling a reporter, ``I believe strongly in political
loyalty.''
   ``It hasn't been that difficult to stick with Wright,'' he
added. In fact, political observers would have been astonished to
see Foley add to Wright's difficulties. Instead, he seemed to
bolster the beleaguered speaker by working to keep the House in
motion.
   Foley kept one eye on the politics of succession, one eye on
legislation.
   He invited budget director Richard Darman and others over for
breakfast. Over scrambled eggs and bacon served in the elegant
majority leader's dining room, the session revolved around the nuts
and bolts of a budget.
   Foley flew to Seattle for former Sen. Warren Magnuson's funeral
and then went on to his eastern Washington district. With a growing
entourage of reporters, he tended to local matters and took time
for a ride in an old Chevy convertible down the main street of
Oakesdale _ about as far away from the Capitol as a politician can
get in both distance, attitude and spirit.
   Even there, Foley was unable to escape from the political
firestorm building in the other Washington. Foley had been
surprised two days before by the news that Democratic Whip Tony
Coelho, following a barrage of reports about his junk bond
investments, was going to resign.
   Late in the day came a CBS report that said the Justice
Department was investigating the personnel practices of Rep.
William Gray, D-Pa., the man who heads the Democratic caucus in the
House.
   ``I want to believe and I hope there was no plan to attempt
political intervention by the Justice Department'' in the Coelho
and Gray cases, Foley said.
   In private back at the Capitol, trusted by both sides, he played
a quiet role in ill-fated negotiations that would have brought
Wright's immediate resignation in exchange for dismissal of some
charges by the House ethics committee.
   He had been Wright's occasional confidant, as well.
   Twice during recent months, Wright indicated he was thinking of
stepping down at the end of his term and told Foley he should
prepare to become speaker. Both times, Foley urged Wright to avoid
any precipitous decisions.
   Foley and Wright met last Tuesday morning, ostensibly to discuss
the week's legislative agenda, but the speaker broached the subject
of resignation and again made clear he wanted to lay his case
before the country and Congress and also wanted a permanent record
in the annals of the House.
   Wednesday began with the budget summit, but within hours Wright
told Foley he intended to make a speech on the House floor _ a
signal he was going to resign.
   A flurry of meetings in Foley's office followed, including one
with Rep. Julian Dixon, D-Calif., chairman of the ethics committee.
   Foley spent the next several hours on the House floor. In the
process, he informed Republican Leader Bob Michel of the speaker's
decision. Wright asked Foley to preside over the House and it was
Foley who recognized the speaker for his hour-long resignation
speech.
   Afterward, Foley quickly was on the phone asking colleagues for
support, now that he could make an open bid for the speakership.
   There were no other contenders. But he said he had learned from
former Speaker Thomas ``Tip'' O'Neill not to take anything or
anyone for granted.
   ``People like to be asked for their support one-on-one,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   The massive Boston-Washington urban corridor
is home to one in six Americans, the Census Bureau reported Tuesday.
   Data from a new census study also show that the corridor
contains almost one in four of the Americans who reside in
metropolitan areas.
   The data, for 1987, showed 43.5 million people residing in the
East Coast corridor which includes 25 contiguous metropolitan
statistical areas.
   With a national population of 243,396,000 people as of July 1,
1987, that means about 17 percent of the nation lived in the
megalopolis.
   And the bureau reports that 187,072,000 Americans lived in
metropolitan areas, nearly 23 percent of them in the
Boston-Washington region.
   There are four major clusters within the Boston-Washington
region: New York-Philadelphia, 27.8 million; Boston-Providence,
R.I., 6.2 million; Washington-Baltimore, 6.1 million and
Harrisburg-York, Pa., 1 million.

his native India, was named winner of a $200,000 prize Tuesday.
   Kurien, 67, was the second Indian to get the prize since it was

won by Robert F. Chandler, founder of the International Rice
Research Institute.
   The World Food Prize is given by General Foods Fund Inc., a
foundation financed by General Foods Corp.
   The prize was announced by Norman Borlaug, the American who won
the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 for his work on the ``green
revolution'' in the production of grain.
   Kurien is chairman of India's National Dairy Development Board.
Under his supervision, milk procurement rose from 190,000 tons in
1970 to almost 3 million tons now. His cooperative system has been
extended to other food products.
   He is a graduate of Michigan State University and of India's
Madras University.

<HEAD>Jackson Urges Bank to Make Loans for Housing and Small Firms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson asked Democratic senators
Tuesday to create a domestic world bank which would make loans for
housing and small businesses and generate revenue for government
services.
   Jackson, a former presidential candidate, spoke at a private
meeting of about 20 Democrats on investment plan, which would make
heavy use of pension funds but require no tax money.
   The bank would get its pool of capital from 10 percent of the
$800 billion in public pension funds and money that private pension
programs would be willing to invest, Jackson told reporters.
   The program would be administered by a board of labor,
management and government representatives.
   He said the bank would make government-secured loans which could
``begin to build affordable housing, economically integrated
housing, small and medium-sized businesses.'' The loans would
``generate revenue, which of course pays taxes for a health plan,
and for police and fire services and for education,'' he said.
   Jackson said the senators exhibited ``a great degree of
optimism'', adding that Sens. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., and
Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., promised to conduct hearings on the idea.
   The investment plan is needed, Jackson said, because the budget
deficit prohibits substantial investment in rural and urban
America, and ``banks and insurance companies, with redlining, would
not invest in urban or rural America.''
   ``The Democratic Party ... is at a point to take the offensive,
to take the lead,'' Jackson said. ``Right now, the headlines are
dominated by the leadership changes on the House side and focused
on personal ethics. There is no focus on the ethical challenge to
rebuild America.''

   Faced with a chaotic situation, the U.S.
government is encouraging all Americans in Beijing to leave the
Chinese capital and is arranging for added flights out of the
country, the State Department announced today.
   Spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler described the climate as ``tense
and unsettled'' but said there were no known threats against
American residents, tourists or diplomats. An estimated 1,400
Americans are in Beijing and 8,800 in China overall.
   ``Persons in other parts of China may also wish to leave China
depending on the local situation,'' Ms. Tutwiler said. ``Citizens
who chose to leave should, if possible, avoid routes out of the
country that would require them to travel through Beijing.''
   The spokeswoman said arrangements were being made with United
and Northwest airlines to supplement their regular service from
China with charter flights. Beijing airport was reported open.
   For the first time, meanwhile, the State Department acknowledged
there may be dissension within the ranks of the Chinese armed
forces.
   ``We have reason to believe that all elements of the Army do not
support what is taking place,'' Ms. Tutwiler said. ``We have no
firm evidence of armed clashes.''
   Troops opened fire on Sunday on students in Tiananmen Square,
killing hundreds of the young demonstrators who were demanding
democratic reforms in the world's largest Marxist country.
   Ms. Tutwiler also announced that all Chinese in the United
States would be allowed to remain indefinitely because of the
situation at home. She said President Bush made the move as a
compassionate gesture.
   Sources said telephone calls were being made systematically to
all American residents of Beijing, who had been asked earlier to
make the embassy aware of their whereabouts.
   The State Department on Monday urged American students in China
to stay away from campuses and to remain in touch with the U.S.
embassy. The department also renewed its advisory urging Americans
against travel to China.
   The Chinese capital was threatened with civil war as armies
loyal to rival political factions were reported battling for
control of the city.
   President Bush said Monday the world ``must stand with'' the
Chinese demonstrator who, in a singular act of defiance captured by
television, placed himself in front of a column of tanks rolling
through Beijing.
   ``I think that image is going to be with us for a long time,''
Bush said. ``And all I can say to him, wherever he might be, and to
the people around the world, is: we are, and we must, stand with
him.''
   Crafting a course influenced by his firsthand experience in
China, Bush suspended more than $600 million in U.S. arms sales to
China but stopped short of advocating economic sanctions.
   ``I reserve the right to take a whole new look at things if the
violence escalates,'' Bush said, but for now he is sticking with
the arms move and suspending visits between U.S. and Chinese
military leaders.
   Bush made the announcement _ applauded by congressional leaders
_ at a news conference, but later discussed the China situation
again emotionally during a speech before the Business Roundtable.
   The president met today with the leader of another Asian power,
Pakistan, pledging to join Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in
exploring ``any serious avenue'' to a political solution to the
bloody conflict in Afghanistan.
   ``Prime Minister Bhutto and I reviewed the situation in
Afghanistan. ... We agreed ... that the job is not done,'' Bush
said of the Afghan rebels' struggle to topple the Marxist regime in
Kabul.
   ``Pakistan remains fully committed to a politcal solution'' in
Afghanistan, Mrs. Bhutto said following a meeting with Bush at the
White House.
   In his remarks Monday night to business leaders, Bush said he
was haunted by the sight _ played frequently through the day on
television _ of a demonstrator who stood alone in front of tanks
advancing through Beijing.
   ``I was so moved by the bravery of that individual ... What is
it that gives a young man strength, gives him the courage, to stand
up in front of a column of tanks right there in front of the
world?''
   Bush told the business leaders they should continue to seek
trade with China, claiming he preferred military sanctions against
China rather than economic ones.
   Earlier, he told reporters, ``I don't want to hurt the Chinese
people.'' He rejected out of hand the idea of recalling the U.S.
ambassador.
   ``That would be 180 degrees wrong,'' said Bush, who was himself
the U.S. envoy in China in 1974-75. ``Our ambassador provides one
of the best listening posts we have in China.''
   ``I am trying to take steps that will encourage a peaceful
change, and yet recognize the fact that China does have great pride
in its own history,'' he said.
   Leaders of Congress who visited the White House for a foreign
policy review with the president, including a firsthand report on
his triumphs at last week's NATO summit in Brussels, emerged with
strong praise for the course Bush has set.
   ``I think he's done the right thing,'' said House Majority
Leader Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., after the bipartisan session.
   Bush also made clear, both at his news conference and in an
unusual Oval Office meeting, the depth of what he called the
``great admiration in my heart for the students'' who have
demonstrated and now died for democracy in Beijing.
   Bush also said he would give ``sympathetic review'' to visa
extensions for any of the 40,000 Chinese students studying in the
United States who were afraid of returning home.
   The White House hastily invited four pro-democracy Chinese
graduate students and activists from local universities to meet
with Bush.
   The president looked on approvingly as Jia Hao, 38, a Ph.D.
candidate in political science at George Washington University,
applauded Bush's actions, saying they ``will be a great support
spiritually and physically to the people who are fighting for the
freedom and democracy.''
   Bush condemned the assault as ``a violent and bloody attack'' on
demonstrators who were ``advocating basic human rights.''
   Bush said halting arms sales ``is going to send a strong signal.
I'm not saying it's going to cure the short-range problem in China
... but I think it is very important the Chinese leaders know it's
not going to be business as usual.''
   White House officials said that over $600 million in continuing
military sles to China would be affected _ including a $502 million
program to help the Chinese upgrade electronic and navigational
equipment on their F-8 fighter jets.
   Other projects affected are the final two units in a $62.5
million sale of four artillery-locating radars, a $28.5 million
program for upgrading large-calibre ammunition production, and an
$8.5 million sale of anti-submarine torpedos.
   The United States has sold more than $700 million in arms to
China since 1979.

   After the death of Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, Iran moves into what is arguably the Islamic revolution's
most decisive phase as rival factions jockey for power.
   Some analysts and Iranian opposition figures in exile predict
that Iran will be gripped by another bloody paroxysm as Khomeini's
heirs battle for supremacy.
   However, most believe the transition could take many months of
bitter, but largely peaceful, maneuvering.
   The swift action Sunday by the 83-member Assembly of Experts,
formed in 1979 to ensure the smooth transition of power, in naming
President Ali Khamenei as caretaker ruler appears to have contained
an open struggle for power for the time being
   But it has not eliminated it. The country's political future is
more uncertain now than at any period since Shah Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi was toppled in 1979 and Khomeini returned in triumph from
exile to found the theocratic Islamic republic.
   In its 10 turbulent years, the republic has endured the
hostility of much of the world, bloody internal schisms, a grueling
war with Iraq and the humiliation of having to accept a cease-fire
after a string of battlefield disasters.
   But surviving Khomeini's death and settling the succession issue
will be the revolution's most strenuous test.
   Even as Khomeini was being buried amid scenes of mass anguish,
the men he installed in power were lining up against other.
   One one side are the so-called pragmatists led by Parliament
Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani and Khamenei. They favor a collective
leadership, opening doors to the West and tackling the urgent task
of postwar reconstruction.
   On the other are the anti-Western radicals under Interior
Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, who believe the revolution's
survival depends on Iran's preeminence in the Moslem world and who
seek the spread of Khomeini's fundamentalism.
   Opposition groups in exile, including monarchists led by the
shah's son and heavily armed rebels based in Iraq, have largely
been sidelined and their rhetoric apart, few see them as contenders
in the power struggle.
   Some analysts believe that Iran will move toward a less rigid
religious-based system, downgrading the theocracy that has played
such a dominant role since Khomeini was catapulted to power.
   Khamanei, a hojatoleslam, or middle-ranking cleric, clearly has
not inherited Khomeini's undisputed spiritual authority.
   Since his appointment, Iran's official media has accorded him
the courtesy title of ``ayatollah.''
   But it has not referred to him as ``imam,'' or spiritual leader,
as Khomeini was universally known throughout Iran.
   ``No one can command Kohmeini's authority,'' said Shahram
Chubin, an Iran analyst with Geneva's Graduate Institute of
International Affairs. ``There's a gap and it's got to be filled.
There's movement toward a more secular system,'' he said in a
telephone interview.
   Khomeini died before he could oversee the settlement of the
leadership question.
   That will likely be resolved Aug. 18, when constitutional
changes formulated by a 20-man committee Khomeini appointed in
April will be put to the nation in a referendum held at the same
time as presidential elections.
   The constitutional amendments, aimed at eliminating competing
centers of power which Khomeini described as ``flaws and
imperfections,'' will have a far-reaching impact.
   If, as seems likely, the committee invests the presidency with
wider powers at the expense of the prime ministry, the door will be
open for a more liberal system which favors the so-called
pragmatists.
   The committee may also downgrade the religious credentials
needed for leadership and propose a collective leadership of three
to five figures in the Tehran hierarchy.
   ``In the long run, I'd say the pragmatists will win,'' said
London-based Iran specialist Badeq Mo'in, whose biography of
Khomeini will be published soon.
   ``But in the short term, even the pragmatists will have to
pretend to be radical in order to survive,'' he said.
   ``Survival is the key question for the leadership in Iran today.
Even if they come up with hardline rhetoric now, eventually they'll
have to cope with the outside world and de-isolate themselves in
order to survive.''
   One of the central strands in the power struggle is the economy.
The war and chronic mismanagement has left it in bad shape.
   The key question is whether those who eventually come out on top
look inward, seeking to galvanize the revolutionary zeal that has
clearly flagged, or outward, to end Iran's isolation that has
smothered development.
   Iran faces a social explosion in the years ahead. Its
population, currently about 55 million, will have mushroomed to 100
million by the end of the century.
   Unless the country can rebuild and expand, drawing on foreign
financial aid and technology, it faces economic and political
turmoil on a fightening scale.

<HEAD>Report: Children's Mental Health Care Is Fragmented, Needlessly Expensive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   States are increasingly relying on expensive
residential facilities and state hospitals to treat emotionally
disturbed children when lower-cost, community-based services would
better serve their needs, the National Mental Health Association
said Tuesday.
   In its ``Invisible Children Report,'' the association also said
states must improve coordination of their child mental health
services, which are often spread among welfare, juvenile justice,
education and health systems.
   ``The system for mental health care for children in the United
States is in shambles _ and thus very expensive,'' said the report,
estimating states spend more than $1 billion annually on state
hospital and out-of-state residential care for children.
   ``Much of this investment could be used more appropriately to
develop needed community-based programs,'' which often keep the
child in the home, the report said.
   The association estimates that 12 percent to 15 percent of the
63 million children and adolescents in the United States need
mental health treatment for emotional or other problems.
   Based on its estimate that only one in three children in need of
mental health care is getting it, the association recommended that
states and the federal government triple the resources allocated to
children's mental health services. Association officials said they
had no estimate of the total amount now spent on these services.
   The report cited government and private studies finding that
residential care is on the rise. One study found a 450 percent
increase in placements of youth in private psychiatric facilities
during the earlier part of the decade.
   About 70 percent of current child mental health funding is spent
on residential facilties, the report said.
   ``Policymakers labor under the false assumption that intensive
services are synonymous only with in-patient care,'' the report
said.
   However, the report pointed to in-home crisis programs in
Washington and Florida as examples of programs ``proven effective
in treating the child, preserving the family unit and generating
cost savings.''
   The report found startling differences in comparing the costs of
treatment in residential facilities and state hospitals with those
in the home and in day treatment centers.
   The national average cost of keeping a child in a state hospital
is $299 per day. With the average stay 4.2 months, that amounts to
$38,218. Nationally, the average cost for a residential treatment
facility is $111.67 per day and the average stay is 15.4 months,
for a total cost of $52,300.
   In contrast, the report estimated the cost of six weeks of
intensive in-home crisis counseling at $1,100, and the cost of a
year in day treatment for a seriously emotionally disturbed child
at $15,000 to $18,000.

   In a suburb nearly 8,000 miles from
Tiananmen Square, a band of Chinese students is working around the
clock to relay news from the student rebellion to comrades
throughout China.
   Defying a Chinese news blackout, the students are using
telephones and facsimile machines to contact relatives, other
students, hospitals, newspapers and even sympathetic government
officials.
   Since soliders opened fire on civilians over the weekend, the
students have been trying to confirm rumored troop movements and
compile an accurate body count.
   ``We get very, very different information from different
sources,'' Yuan Liu, a Brandeis University student, said Tuesday.
``Many people in Beijing, they figure out that it's at least 30,000
died. But here, they're reporting 2,600 died.''
   Zhang Longxi, a Harvard University graduate student, scanned a
television set, looking for some of the young people he had once
taught English. They had been widely quoted in the early, peaceful
days of the demonstrations because of their English proficiency. He
hasn't seen them since, and wears a black armband, fearing they
have died.
   One student telephoned his mother, a journalist in Shanghai, to
relay the latest news of shooting in Beijing. He warned her that
troops were rumored to be headed for Shanghai, and that students
should evacuate campuses to avoid bloodshed.
   His mother said phone communications between Beijing and
Shanghai had been all but severed, said the student, who requested
anonymity because he fears retaliation against his parents. He said
he considered going home, but his parents told him, ``Don't even
think about that.''
   The students have been operating out of the Walker Center for
Ecumenical Exchange since May 24, when the center's executive
director, the Rev. Gordon Schultz, offered them half of the
rambling religious center and three free phone lines.
   ``Somehow, the word has spread in China that to get your message
out, call here, because we're getting calls from people we don't
know,'' Schultz said.
   He also persuaded a local hotel to donate a fax machine.
   ``Khomeini's revolution was revolution by cassette tape
recorder, and this is revolution by fax,'' Schultz said.
   Though it has become increasingly difficult to telephone _
students believe the cable to Beijing University has been severed _
and the phone bill is now more than $20,000, the students aren't
giving up, said Xiao Xia Gong, a Harvard University graduate
student and one of the information center's organizers.
   ``First we need to get information from China,'' she said. ``And
we need to give encouragement to students there that they are not
forgotten by the world.''
   The students also want the Chinese military to know that the
rest of the worldis monitoring its actions.
   The Walker center in this Boston suburb has become a haven for
Chinese students worried about their loved ones and frustrated by
their isolation from the momentous events in their homeland.
   The students have been passing information gleaned from their
sources to American news organizations, including Voice of America,
Schultz said. In some cases their information has been confirmed by
Western media reports hours later, he said, but other reports have
been impossible to substantiate.
   For example, three different sources calling from Canton,
Beijing, and Nanjing, have reported seeing soliders with glassy
eyes and slack jaws who appear to have been drugged, Schultz said.
Rumor in China has it that the soldiers were injected with some
mood-altering drug, which they were told was an antibiotic, in
order to make them more willing to deal harshly with the students,
he said.
   Yuan Liu said the students have been able to reach foreign
embassies and banks, but are having trouble reaching private
telephones in Beijing.
   ``It's better if they call us but it's risky because you have to
give the operator your name and all the phones are bugged,'' he
said.
   He said one student had managed to get through from a pay phone
to report on the shooting on one of Beijing's thoroughfares,
shortly after it began.
   A student who studied at Harvard and had returned to Beijing
called to say that Chinese troops were laughing as they randomly
shot students, Schultz said.
   The students are recording and transcribing all of their
telephone conversations in an attempt to preserve source materials
on the democracy movement for history.
   The project, dubbed ``Tiananmen 1989 Archives,'' is being
supported by the Center for East Asian Studies at the University of
Chicago, said Zhang Longxi.
   ``We feel that this is very, very signifcant in terms of the
historical moment,'' he said. ``This is going to be very
important.''

   Mayor Richard M. Daley says the city is wasting
hundreds of thousands of dollars on consultants to advise on how to
keep washrooms clean and how much toilet paper to use at O'Hare
International Airport.
   Daley said Monday he has halted $1.5 million worth of consultant
contracts at O'Hare.
   Among them was a $265,000 study of O'Hare janitors by Erwin A.
France, a top adviser to Daley's predecessor, Eugene Sawyer. Daley
took office in April.
   Daley said one other study detailed how much toilet paper was
used at the airport.
   ``Do I have to tell them how much toilet paper they need to
order?'' Daley asked. ``I mean that's ridiculous. It was a waste of
money, that's all it was.''
   Daley said he had also canceled a $208,000 contract awarded to
put up Christmas decorations and $36,000 for radio ads to tell
travelers to leave for the airport early on a holiday weekend.
   Some of the contracts may be reissued at lower rates, ``but the
city is not going to pay one more cent for unnecessary studies,''
he said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a transcript of House Republican
leader Bob Michel's remarks Tuesday introducing Tom Foley as the
new speaker of the House.
   Once again I hold in my hand, temporarily alas, the symbol of
the authority of the speaker of the House. We are taught that it is
better to give than to receive. I believe that.
   When it comes to the speaker's gavel, I have become
distressingly expert at it, having now gone down to defeat for the
sixth straight time on a party line vote. I look forward to the day
when someone on the other side of the aisle learns the joy of such
selfless behavior.
   My colleagues, I know you are anxious to hear from the speaker,
but before presenting him formally to you I would ask your
forbearance that I make a few comments of my own.
   During the recent past, we have taken part in a number of
ceremonies commemorating the bicentennial of the House of
Representatives.
   We had a marvelous celebration on this floor in which many of us
got the opportunity to say what we believed about this great
institution.
   But in a curious irony of history, some might say a tragedy of
history, the very year in which we celebrated the great traditions
and glories of the House it has been blighted by unprecedented
crises, personal and institutional.
   Today, we have that rare, most precious, improbable of gifts, a
second chance for comprehensive bipartisan institutional reform
that will set the course for the next century.
   Let me turn to my friends on the other side of the aisle, for a
moment. I hope you'll take this in the spirit in which it's
intended.
   First, no political party, no man or woman in the House, no
faction or ideology has a monopoly on virtue. Human folly is an
equal opportunity employer. No, there is no monopoly on virtue.
   But for over 35 years there has been a monopoly of power in the
House, 35 years of uninterrupted power can act like a corrosive
acid upon the restraints of civility and comity. Those who have
been kings of the Hill for so long may forget that majority status
is not a divine right and minority status is not a permanent
condition.
   At the heart of our crises are not personal faults of individual
members. After 32 years as a member and over 40 years on the Hill,
it is my belief that the personal integrity of the overwhelming
number of members of this institution is and has been as good or
better than that of any group in our society, especially those who
criticize the most.
   I believe that the processes established by the House to deal
with ethics cases have to proceed.
   The former speaker said in his farewell address to the House
that this mindless cannibalism has got to stop.
   Now, it's a catchy phrase.
   But the distinguished members of the ethics committee, equally
divided from both parties, are neither mindless nor cannibals.
   In fact, in fact, it is their reasoned judgment under
extraordinary pressure that stands between us and the cannibalism
which the speaker referred to.
   I'm all for putting an end to bitterness. I'm all in favor of
putting our House in order. But we don't do so by sweeping things
under the rug.
   This House is in a convulsive state. We've experienced some
really dark days. But I take heart in the strengths that are built
into this institution to cope with the times. I also take heart
that Tom Foley, for whom I have the greatest admiration, will be
the new speaker.
   Yes, we're going to have our marked differences, that's the
nature of this place. But that need not intrude on the mutual
respect and the trust that we have for one another as leaders.
   Tom Foley coming from the Great Pacific Northwest reminds me of
the line of poetry that says: ``But Westward look, the land is
bright.''
   Congratulations, Mr. Speaker-elect. Let me hand over to you the
symbol of the great power and the great responsibility you have
just been given by the House.
   Ladies and gentlemen of the House, what a privilege for me to
present to you the new speaker of the House of Representatives.

<HEAD>Leaking Oil Line Exempt From Federal Inspection</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CRAIG, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Amoco pipeline that spilled crude oil
into the Yampa River last week is among hundreds of miles of
Colorado pipelines exempted from government safety inspections,
officials say.
   The oil industry persuaded the Reagan administration in 1985 to
drop all federal maintenance inspections of that type of oil
pipeline, known as a gathering line.
   As a result, the U.S. Department of Transportation's Office of
Pipeline Safety no longer conducts regular checks on the Amoco
line, which leaked about 10,000 gallons of light crude Friday into
the Yampa River in northwestern Colorado. But an Amoco spokesman
said the company meets federal standards on such lines.
   The spill was declared contained Sunday, and much of the oil
that was not contained broke up or was washed away in the swiftly
flowing river, officials said. But they said there still could be
long-range effects on the environment. That part of the river is
home to three endangered fish species.
   Traces of the spill were found as far away as 100 miles
downriver from the site.
   Jack Overly, who oversees oil-pipeline inspections in 12 Western
states from the transportation department's Denver regional office,
said he didn't have figures on the number of miles of pipeline were
exempted from regulation. But he estimated the total as 1,000 miles
in Colorado alone.
   ``If this leak was caused by corrosion, we definitely could have
had an effect on this pipeline'' if it still were subject to
federal regulation and inspection, Overly said.
   Amoco executives said the company still does not know what
caused the leak. But Overly, noting that the leak occurred where
the pipeline passed beneath the river, said rust ``is the first
thing I would suspect.''
   The 6-inch line carried more than 100,000 gallons of crude oil a
day.
   A gathering line generally links an oil field with storage tanks.
   The transportation department still inspects about 500 miles of
oil pipelines in Colorado, Overly said. Those pipelines are called
transmission lines, and they generally link refineries with major
distribution points.
   Amoco spokesman Jack Rigg confirmed that the 106-mile pipeline
involved in the leak, linking an oil field near Craig with storage
tanks in Wamsutter, Wyo., is subject to no state or federal
inspections.
   He said Amoco's policy on maintenance is to ``comply with ...
federal regulation'' on all company pipelines, even though the
regulations no longer apply to gathering lines.
   He said the line at Craig was inspected in 1985 and repaired in
1986.
   Overly said that Reagan administration officials exempted
gathering lines from federal regulation after oil executives said
the pipes didn't pose serious threats to public health because most
pass through remote terrain.

<TEXT>
   A pipeline that provided 90 percent of the
gasoline for the Las Vegas area before it exploded in California
could be back in operation by Friday, which could mean a drop in
prices at the gas pump.
   Prices jumped as much as a nickel a gallon when the pipeline
exploded May 25 in San Bernardino, Calif., killing two people and
injuring 31. The blast knocked out the Calnev Co. pipeline that
carried gasoline and diesel fuel from Southern California
refineries to the Las Vegas Valley.
   Oil companies had to ship gasoline 300 miles by truck,
increasing the cost of transportation.
   Arco, the dominant oil company in southern Nevada, raised its
prices to dealers 5 cents a gallon in the first days following the
explosion. Arco officials say the company's prices ``absolutely''
will drop once the line reopens.
   Chevron officials say it cost an extra 6{ cents a gallon to
truck gasoline to Las Vegas, and not all costs were passed on to
dealers.
   No gasoline shortages or service station lines have been
reported in the city.
   The price for self service unleaded gasoline has been running
$1.10 to $1.12 a gallon since the pipeline explosion.

   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini was buried
Tuesday after a day of tumult in which frenzied mourners snatched
the shroud from their revered leader's body and tore it to shreds
for holy relics.
   Thousands of Revolutionary Guards and civilians jostled around
the grave at the Baheshte Zahra cemetery, raising clouds of dust,
as Khomeini's body was finally laid to rest at 4:45 p.m.
   A television announcer, his voice hoarse with emotion, chanted
``Father, don't leave your children! Oh father don't leave your
beloved!'' as the crowd surged toward the grave. People wept and
beat their heads and chests with clenched fists in the Shiite
Moslem expression of bereavement.
   Soldiers passed concrete slabs over the sea of mourners and laid
them across the grave, a shallow pit in a 100-square-yard section
of the vast cemetery where men who died in the Islamic revolution
and the 8-year war with Iraq are buried.
   A crane lowered a metal freight container onto the grave to
prevent people from grabbing handfuls of dirt from it and possibly
unearthing the body.
   Guns roared a last salute to the 86-year-old patriarch who
toppled a 2,500-year-old monarchy in 1979 and transformed Iran into
a militant Islamic state. For the moment, at least, no special
marker was put on the grave.
   Earlier in the day, mourners blocked the path of a van carrying
the body in an open coffin from the square where it had lain in
state for 24 hours in an air-conditioned glass cubicle.
   Mourners scrambling for mementos grabbed the tightly wrapped
white shroud in which Moslems are buried and tore it to shreds. The
body fell to the ground and was taken to an ambulance.
   State television later showed mourners grabbing at the body and
shroud, exposing the feet, then the broadcast was cut off abruptly.
   ``The people love the imam too much,'' said a young man at the
scene. ``They cannot bear to see him buried.'' He said they wanted
pieces of the shroud ``as sacred relics.''
   Iranians refer to Khomeini as the imam, or spiritual leader.
   The coffin was transferred to a military helicopter, but the
crowd rushed forward as it tried to land. As the helicopter flew
away with the coffin protruding from its open door, the crowd was
told the burial had been postponed.
   Three hours later, however, a helicopter landed the rewrapped
body in a metal casket. Hashemi Rafsanjani, the parliament speaker,
and Khomeini's son Ahmad accompanied the body and oversaw the
burial.
   Ahmad was knocked down in the earlier melee around the coffin
and lost his black turban. He looked pale and dazed as he was
hoisted above the crowd and passed from hand to hand to an
ambulance.
   Women clad in head-to-toe black chadors rubbed shoulders with
men despite the Islamic prohibition of physical contact between a
woman and any man other than her husband.
   Firemen sprayed the crowd with jets of water from fire hoses.
   Most of Tehran's 6 million people appeared to be in the streets
Tuesday, and official media said millions more came from other
regions to bid Khomeini farewell. About 2 million mourners had kept
a night-long vigil around the bier in Mousalam Mosque, 22 miles
north of the cemetery.
   Eight people were killed Monday in the packed square, some
suffocating and others trampled to death. About 500 mourners were
injured or collapsed in temperatures of 104.
   Khomeini died of a heart attack Saturday, 11 days after
intestinal surgery, without settling the question of who would
succeed him.
   He left a 29-page ``political testament,'' extracts of which his
son read over Tehran radio Monday.
   It contained an attack on the United States, which Khomeini
called the ``Great Satan,'' and said Iran should guard against
``the conspiracies and plots of the enemies toward the Islamic
Republic.''
   ``In the forefront of these is America, this vile state
terrorist, which has set fire to the whole world, and its ally
global Zionism, which, to attain its goals, commits such crimes
that pens are ashamed to document them and tongues are ashamed to
recite them,'' he said.
   Nothing was said of how Iran should be governed after Khomeini's
death, but that may be contained in sections not yet released.
   President Ali Khamenei, 49, was named caretaker leader on
Sunday, winning 60 of 74 votes cast by the Assembly of Experts, a
group Khomeini formed soon after the revolution to handle the
succession issue.
   His swift appointment appeared aimed at filling the political
vacuum and averting an immediate power struggle between hard liners
and those who favor restoring ties with the West.

<HEAD>Greenpeace Reports Dozens of Nuclear Weapons, Reactors Lost on Ocean
Floor</HEAD>
<HEAD>By DONNA CASSATA</HEAD>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 50 nuclear weapons and nine nuclear
reactors, the products of U.S. and Soviet naval accidents since
World War II, are lost on the ocean floor, Greenpeace officials
said Tuesday.
   ``There are more likely more Soviet weapons and reactors on the
bottom of the ocean,'' said William M. Arkin, co-author of the
report by the Greenpeace environmental group, which favors
nuclear-free seas, and the Institute for Policy Studies, a liberal
research group.
   Using data obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, the
groups found that more than 2,000 major peacetime naval accidents
have occurred since 1945 resulting in some 2,800 deaths. The
accidents ranged from the loss of an entire vessel and crew to
minor collisions and fires that left little damage and some
injuries.
   The researchers omitted incidents that occurred during the
Vietnam and Korean Wars and in the Persian Gulf during the
Iran-Iraq war, Arkin said.
   Since World War II, 10 U.S. and Soviet accidents and a decision
by the United States to intentionally scuttle one reactor, have
left 50 sunken warheads and nine reactors on the ocean floor.
Forty-three of the 50 warheads and six of the nine reactors are
Soviet.
   The report specifically details 1,276 accidents, including the
Soviet Mike-class submarine that sank in the Norwegian Sea on April
7 with two nuclear tipped torpedoes and two nuclear reactors aboard.
   The most serious incident apparently was the sinking of a Soviet
Yankee-class submarine with 32 nuclear warheads and two nuclear
torpedoes aboard. The sinking occurred 600 miles northeast of
Bermuda on Oct. 6, 1986.
   But Arkin said the number of nuclear weapons on the ocean floor
may be higher because ``we are ascribing only two nuclear torpedoes
to each Soviet submarine. They could, of course, have more.''
   Arkin said researchers received no information from the Soviet
Union for their study and when ``we asked the (U.S.) intelligence
community to provide us with their analysis of Soviet accidents,
they declined to do so on the basis of security.''
   The report found that of the accidents, 228 involved aircraft
carriers, 406 other major surface warships, 182 supply ships, 142
minor military ships and 75 amphibious vessels.
   Seventy-five incidents involved sinkings. Of these, 27 were
submarines _ five of them Soviet, four American, four French and
three British, as well as submarines from West Germany, Israel,
Pakistan, Peru, Spain and Turkey.
   ``In accident after accident after accident, human failure is
the responsible cause,'' Arkin said.
   In addition, about 30 percent of the 1,276 accidents occurred in
ports, possibly endangering civilians nearby, said Joshua Handler,
the report's other co-author and a researcher with Greenpeace. Of
those accidents, 624 occurred in the Atlantic Ocean, 318 in the
Pacific, 110 in the Mediterranean Sea and 34 in the Indian Ocean.
   Greenpeace earlier revealed information about two U.S. accidents
that received wide publicity over the past month. In 1965, an A-4
warplane fell off the USS Ticonderoga near Okinawa with a hydrogen
bomb aboard, and on Nov. 22, 1975, a fire aboard the USS Belknap
came within 40 feet of nuclear weapons.
   Arkin said he suspected that the sinking of a Soviet destroyer
in the Black Sea in 1974 involved nuclear weapons or reactors, but
said that has never been verified. Holding up a Russian-language
version of the study, he said a copy would be delivered to the
Soviet Embassy in Washington.

   Haggling in a Central Asian bazaar over the price
of strawberries sparked a spasm of ethnic violence, arson attacks
and rampages by ax-wielding mobs in which 50 people were killed,
Uzbekistan's Communist Party chief reported Tuesday.
   Rafik Nishanov told lawmakers in Moscow that authorities had
re-established ``full control'' in the Fergana Valley 1,500 miles
southeast of Moscow following more than a week of bloody clashes
between Uzbeks and members of an ethnic Turkish minority, the
Meskhi. But he indicated the situation was still explosive.
   An Interior Ministry spokesman said 6,000 internal security
troops had been sent to restore order in the Fergana Valley, a
national center of grape and cotton growing.
   Some of the 12,000 Meskhi in the area were evacuated Sunday and
Monday to a military garrison to be housed in barracks under guard,
the Uzbek leader said in nationally televised remarks. ``They are
safe now,'' Nishanov said.
   The violence between the two Moslem groups was the latest
outbreak of Soviet ethnic unrest, and its roots could be traced to
the brutal policies of Josef Stalin, who uprooted the entire
population of 300,000 Meskhi from their homeland in Soviet Georgia
in November 1944 and deported them to the east under pretext of
evacuation as the Germans approached.
   The Meskhi began to demand in 1956 that they be allowed to
return to Meskhetia, their homeland in the Caucasus, and Nishanov
said they had been pressing their demands harder as the country's
new parliament, the Congress of People's Deputies, meets in Moscow.
   Interior Ministry spokesman, Col. Boris Mikhailov, told the Tass
news agency the clashes between Uzbeks and the Meskhi Turks began
May 23, when a fight provoked by ``extremists'' in the city of
Kuvasai near the border of Soviet Kirghizia caused the death of one
man and injured 60 others.
   Last Saturday, Mikhailov said, ``about 200 hooligans armed with
metal rods, sticks and bottles filled with gasoline staged pogroms
and set fire to buildings in the town of Tashlak.'' He said
``dozens of cars and houses'' were burned.
   The violence was spawned by ``an insignificant, minor conflict''
at a market when a Meskhi Turk rudely spoke to a woman selling
fruit whose prices he thought were too high, then knocked over her
plate of strawberries, Nishanov said.
   ``Citizens there perceived this as an insult, and a fight
started,'' Nishanov told the Soviet of Nationalities, one of the
houses of the bicameral Soviet legislature, during its inaugural
session Tuesday.
   Tempers enflamed by the marketplace squabble cooled, but Meskhis
later attacked a group of Uzbeks and killed one of them, Nishanov
said.
   Calm was restored, he said. But about a week later, he said, a
large group of Uzbeks ranging in age from 15 to 22 and ``in high
spirits as a result of alcohol or drugs'' unexpectedly set off to
attack the homes where the Meskhi live.
   ``The Uzbek youth, armed with sticks, chains and axes, beat up
people they found on the way and set fire to some homes belonging
to Meskhi Turks,'' Nishanov said.
   Soviet television reported Monday night that the dispute in the
Fergana Valley turned into ``vicious clashes between thousands of
furious people.'' It said the violence began as an ethnic dispute,
but was fueled by chronic local unemployment.
   Nishanov told lawmakers that according to information available
Tuesday, about 50 people had been killed, including 35 or more
Meskhi Turks, 10 Uzbeks, one ethnic Tadzhik and an ethnic Russian
who had been among those who ``restored order.''
   Mikhailov told Tass that 200 people suspected of organizing and
taking part in the rioting had been detained. A curfew was imposed
in the area, Nishanov said.
   Komsolmolskaya Pravda, the daily organ of the Komsomol Young
Communist League, said a total of 194 people had been hospitalized,
and that policemen and party workers were among the casualities.
The government daily Izvestia said Interior Ministry troops and
officers were also hurt.
   Almaz Estekov, a Moslem activist in Moscow, said representatives
of the unofficial grassroots movement Berlik in Tashkent,
Uzbekistan's capital, told him by telephone that 13 policemen had
been killed.
   But calls from Moscow to the Fergana Valley did not go through
Tuesday, and the report could not be independently confirmed.
   The Meskhi were used as the principal labor force in
constructing the irrigation system in the barren Golodnaya Steppe
of north-central Uzbekistan, which was turned into a flourishing
agricultural district.
   The Meskhi are ethnically related to the Georgians but were
under Turkish rule during the 16th and 17th centuries, converted to
Islam and adopted many Turkish characteristics. At present some
Meskhi consider themselves Turks, while others consider themselves
Georgians.

   A military court on Tuesday acquitted
an army major of charges that he took part in an attempt to
overthrow the government of President Corazon Aquino in 1987.
   The five-man military tribunal said the prosecution failed to
produce evidence that Maj. Horacio Lactao disregarded lawful orders
from a superior officer.
   Lactao led about 30 soldiers aboard a column of tanks and
armored personnel carriers from the army training camp in Nueva
Ecija province to Manila at the height of the bloodiest of six coup
attempts against Mrs. Aquino.
   The coup on Aug. 28, 1987, left at least 53 people dead and
hundreds others wounded.
   Military troops loyal to Mrs. Aquino blocked Lactao's group
before it entered Manila. Lactao said he did not violate any orders
when he led the convoy back to the training camp on his own.
   Last year, Lactao and his men were cleared by another court
martial of charges of mutiny.

<HEAD>`Brown II' Desegregation Ruling Gives Topeka Options Besides Busing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HANNA</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   An appeals court will let Topeka officials
decide how to correct violations of the 35-year-old landmark U.S.
Supreme Court decision to desegregate schools, and busing is not a
likely option, lawyers said Tuesday.
   The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel in Denver said that
although Topeka officials had not resisted integration mandated by
the Brown vs. the Board of Education decision in 1954, segregation
still existed. The court's 2-1 ruling, released Monday, requires
Topeka to remedy racial imbalances in its public schools.
   ``I doubt that we're talking about busing,'' said Rich Jones, an
attorney for a group of parents who brought the desegregation
lawsuit. ``I doubt if we're talking about anything really radical.
This school district is not one of the worst school districts. It
wasn't the worst we had seen, or the worst we had read about.''
   Gary Sebelius, the school district's attorney, said speculation
on what officials will have to do is premature.
   ``They didn't tell us what to do,'' he said. ``Something has to
be be done. They don't say what.''
   Barbara Kudlacek, the district's spokeswoman, added: ``There's
too much that has to happen before we even start to discuss that. I
don't think there are easy answers.''
   The district could ask the appellate court for a rehearing
before all 10 judges and, if it gets a similar decision there, it
could appeal to the U.S. Surpeme Court. Sebelius said he didn't
know whether the board would seek a rehearing.
   ``No one has suggested that we have anything less than an
excellent program,'' Sebelius said. ``There's just a differing view
as to whether its done all it could do.''
   In 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that segregated school
systems were unconstitutional because separate facilities for
blacks and whites provided inherently unequal educational
opportunities. The ruling came in a lawsuit against the Topeka
district, which had set aside four elementary schools for black
children.
   In 1979, parents of 17 black schoolchildren sued the district
again, contending it had not eliminated vestiges of segregation.
The parents included Linda Brown Buckner, a student in 1954 whose
unmarried name is on the landmark case.
   The reopened case, sometimes called Brown II, went to trial in
October 1986. U.S. District Judge Richard Rogers of Topeka ruled in
April 1987 that the school district did not bear liability for
racial imbalances in some of its schools because the parents failed
to prove it intentionally tried to keep schools segregated.
   The appeals court said Rogers applied too strict a standard and
said the parents merely had to prove segregation existed, given the
history of the district.
   The parents had pointed to seven elementary schools and one
middle school that they said had a disproportionately high number
of minority students. At the time of the trial, 26 percent of the
Topeka's schoolchildren were from minority groups, and 19 percent
were black. There are about 14,000 students in the district.
   Dan Biles, a lawyer for the State Board of Education, said he
was not sure what the appellate court's decision will mean in
practical terms. Biles said he thinks the court has narrowed the
scope of the case to focus on the assignment of students to
schools, school attendance boundaries and the assignment of faculty
and staff.
   Although he was reluctant to discuss specific solutions, Jones
suggested that the district may consider tinkering with attendance
boundaries or improving curriculum at some predominantly black
schools.

   A whisker-stubble has replaced the peach fuzz. But Osmond, 31,
said in a recent interview that he is still having image troubles.
   ``This guy at a radio station in Florida refused to play the
record,'' Osmond recalls. ``I called him and asked, Why? He said,
`Because you're a wimp!' So, I gave him as good as I got and we
agreed to arm wrestle.
   ``If I won, he'd have to play it. I won and he's playing it.''
   Osmond even considered changing his name to express his maturity.
   ``I started realizing, `What am I hiding?' I think there would
have been a bigger backlash associated with a name change than just
coming out and saying, `Look, it's me.' That's why I named this
album `Donny Osmond.' You can't get plainer than that,'' he said.

<HEAD>Crowe Will Ask Soviet Counterparts to Spell Out Their Force-Cutting
Plans</HEAD>

   Adm. William J. Crowe, the senior U.S.
military officer, begins his first visit to the Soviet Union next
Monday and will ask his Soviet counterparts to spell out their
proposals to cut conventional forces in Europe.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in his arms-cut
proposals, ``has talked about men and he has talked about weapons
systems,'' Crowe, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told
reporters at the Pentagon on Tuesday.
   ``There are a lot of questions in our mind about exactly what
that means, and what dismantling means, and what they will do with
those systems, and what systems they are talking about. Those
questions have not all been answered,'' said Crowe, who during his
11-day visit will go to five of the 15 Soviet republics.
   The Eastern and Western alliances have recently proposed very
similar ideas for cutting conventional forces in central Europe,
but have not yet concluded a deal.
   Crowe said that he would ask the Soviets why they recently
increased tank production, despite statements by Gorbachev that
defense spending would be cut by 14 percent and military production
by 20 percent over coming years.
   During the trip Crowe may sign an agreement on curbing dangerous
military incidents, such as the shooting death of Maj. Arthur
Nicholson at the hands of Soviet soldiers in East Germany on March
24, 1985.
   Crowe said the proposed agreement would address naval incidents
inside territorial waters, such as the bumping of two U.S. Navy
vessels by Soviet ships off the Crimea in the Black Sea on Feb. 12,
1988, and the use of laser range finders that might blind soldiers
or sailors on the either side.
   The visit by Crowe, who will be accompanied by the vice chiefs
of the four U.S. military services, follows a tour of the United
States last July by Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev, then the Soviet
chief of staff. Akhromeyev has since become an adviser to
Gorbachev, and been replaced as defense minister by Col. Gen.
Mikhail A. Moiseyev.
   The Americans, according to an itinerary handed out at the
briefing, will visit an unidentified Soviet missile facility near
Khelmnitsky in the Ukraine, see a ground exercise in Byelorussia,
and ride on a Soviet missile cruiser and watch a naval maneuver off
Murmansk, the northern Soviet port on the Barents Sea.
   Crowe, a submariner, has asked to see the inside of a submarine,
a request that the Soviets have neither accepted nor rejected.
   ``My instincts tell me that they will be very forthcoming,'' he
said.
   He will also deliver an address at the Voroshilov military
academy, and visit numerous graveyards, laying a total of seven
wreaths.
   ``I don't know who is behind the wreaths,'' he joked at the
briefing.
   The visit also includes time for extensive discussions with
Soviet military leaders.
   ``Certainly my purpose is not to negotiate. But I discovered
last year when Marshal Akhromeyev _ and he and I had many hours
together talking _ that it was very fruitful, at least from my
perspective,'' Crowe said.
   ``We clarified things. We attempted to brush away some of the
misunderstandings. There are a lot of questions that military
people always carry around in their minds. Often we develop on our
own the wrong answers. This gives me an opportunity to address my
counterparts directly,'' he said.
   ``When Marshal Akhromeyev departed last year, I felt much better
about what I knew and what they were saying and so forth,'' said
Crowe.
   The admiral said that U.S intelligence on Soviet military
capabilities ``has been good, but obviously in certain areas we
have done better than in others.
   ``We have been surprised on occasion. We have not done as well
as we would prefer. Marshal Akhromeyev and I actually talked about
that. I think there is a built-in tendency to overestimate the
strength of ... opponents,'' he said.
   ``Marshal Akhromeyev and I on occasion pointed out to each other
that he didn't understand our forces ... I told him that he
overestimated my capability and he told me that I greatly
overestimated his. He was talking about ground and I was talking
about Navy,'' said Crowe, a naval officer. Akhromeyev is an army
officer.
   Crowe also predicted that the two sides would discuss the
military crackdown in China and developments in North and South
Korea. ``We will both have some curiosity about the other's
feelings about what is going on in that part of the world.''

   President Bush on Tuesday told visiting
Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto that the United States is
willing ``to explore any serious avenue'' to achieve a political
solution in Afghanistan.
   Mrs. Bhutto in turn said after private talks with the president
that ``we are in complete accord'' on the situation in Afghanistan,
stalemated since the pullout of the last Soviet troops in February.
   Bush said the withdrawal of the Red Army proved the
effectiveness of U.S-Pakistani support for the Afghan resistance
fighting the Marxist regime in Kabul. Pakistan shares a common
border with Afghanistan.
   ``We agreed, however, that the job is not done,'' said Bush.
``The Mujahdeen continues and their struggle for self-determination
goes on.''
   ``Prime Minister Bhutto and I discussed ways to encourage a
political solution in Afghanistan that will lead to a non-aligned,
representative government willing to live in peace with its
neighbors, to replace the illegitimate regime in Kabul,'' said
Bush. ``The United States and Pakistan will continue to explore any
serious avenue towards this end.''
   U.S. officials had anticipated a rapid demise for the government
of Najibullah after the Soviet pullout, but it has not happened.
   Mrs. Bhutto said she and Bush ``have reviewed the situation in
the light of the prevailing circumstances and we are in complete
accord'' on what needs to be done.
   ``Pakistan remains committed to a political solution of the
Afghan problem, whereby the brave people of Afghanistan will have
the right to freely choose their own government without
interference from outside,'' she said.
   Mrs. Bhutto, the daughter of former Prime Minister Ali Bhutto,
said that while the Soviet pullout ``has brought a welcome change
in Afghanistan, the continued fighting and prolonged presence of
over 3.5 million Afghan refugees pose serious threats to the peace
and stability of the region.''
   After a full-dress military ceremony on the White House lawn,
including a 19-gun salute, and an Oval Office meeting with Bush,
Mrs. Bhutto went to the State Department for a meeting with
Secretary of State James A. Baker III and a lunch in her honor.
   Pakistan has a standing request to buy 60 more F-16 fighter jets
from the United States. Bush brushed aside reporters' attempts to
ask about reports that approval of the jet sale is imminent.
   On another topic, Bush said Mrs. Bhutto ``assured me that
Pakistan's nuclear program is committed to peaceful purposes.''
   He said he underlined his commitment ``to discourage
proliferation of nuclear and chemical weapons, ballistic missiles,
in the South Asia region and around the world.''
   The two leaders also discussed efforts to combat drug production
and trafficking. Bush said he ``applauded her tough stance on
eradicating the opium cultivation'' and thanked her for extraditing
an alleged drug trafficker.
   The two countries were expected to sign agreements on housing,
narcotics and education this week during Bhutto's stay. Pakistan,
the third largest recipient of U.S. aid, is slated for $380 million
in economic assistance and $240 million in military aid next year.
   Mrs. Bhutto's father was deposed by Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq in
1977 and hanged two years later for a political murder. Zia
remained in power until perishing in a mysterious plane crash last
year that also claimed the life of U.S. Ambassador Arnold Raphel
and an American general.
   Mrs. Bhutto, who had picked up her father's fallen standard and
been jailed for a time under Zia, led her Pakistan People's Party
to victory as head of a coalition government last November.
   Mrs. Bhutto was scheduled to address a joint session of Congress
on Wednesday. She also had stops here at the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund. She will receive an honorary degree at
her alma mater, Harvard University, on Thursday and visit the
United Nations on Friday. She departs for home Saturday evening.

<HEAD>Florida Governor Sets Special Election Dates For Pepper's Seat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The race is on for the seat left vacant by the
death of Rep. Claude Pepper, with early expectations that the Aug.
29 special election called Tuesday could produce the first Cuban
exile in Congress.
   Gov. Bob Martinez announced the election schedule one day after
burial of the 88-year-old congressman following a week of
ceremonies and mourning.
   ``Claude Pepper will be difficult, if not impossible, to replace
in Congress. But it's vitally important that we move as quickly as
possible so that the people of Florida's 18th congressional
district can be represented,'' Martinez said.
   Some leaders of the Republican Party, riding a wave of GOP
momentum in the state, were focusing upon state Sen. Ileana
Ros-Lehtinen of Miami as their leading candidate for the seat that
had been held by Pepper, a liberal Democrat, since its inception.
   Carlos Perez, a Cuban-born millionaire banana importer and
active supporter of Ronald Reagan and Oliver North, also said he
will run as a Republican.
   Democrats, with a longer list of interested candidates, had no
one publicly committed.
   ``The Democrats should probably rally behind one candidate,''
said Miami City Commissioner Rosario Kennedy, a Cuban-American
among the potential Democratic contenders. ``But it's too early.''
   A first primary was set for Aug. 1 and any runoff would be Aug.
15. Martinez said elections would be held on the same day to
replace state officeholders who seek the congressional seat. Under
state law, they have to resign before they run.
   Candidates must file their nominating petitions with the state
Division of Elections on June 19 or 20.
   Pepper, known nationwide for his efforts on behalf on the
elderly, won every election for the district since the first in
1962, with his closest race in the past decade a 61-39 percent
victory in 1984 over Cuban-American Ricardo Nunez. Last year, he
had no opposition at all.
   But Republicans have gained strength in the district, as
Democratic registration has sagged from 72 percent a decade ago to
54 percent now.
   Hispanics, estimated by some politicians to comprise nearly half
the district, are considered likely to support a Cuban candidate.
It's estimated that three-quarters of Cuban-American voters in the
region are Republican.
   ``I think the chances are pretty good for a Cuban-American to be
elected from that district,'' said Sergio Bendixen, a Democratic
strategist. ``Without a doubt, that person would be the most
powerful Cuban-American in the country.''
   Miami Mayor Xavier Suarez, elected in 1985 as the city's first
Cuban-born mayor, ruled himself out of the House race Tuesday.
Suarez, an independent, didn't formally endorse anyone but praised
Ros-Lehtinen. She meanwhile said she would hold a news conference
Wednesday to discuss her future.
   Republican state Rep. Al Gutman, a Cuban-born Jew whose heritage
fits two large ethnic groups in the district, was also mulling his
possibilities Tuesday.
   On the Democratic side, state Sen. Jack Gordon said he will
decide by Friday whether to run. Gordon, 67, shares much of
Pepper's constituency and liberalism, but may have problems with
Hispanic voters because of his opposition to Nicaraguan Contra aid
and other foreign policy issues.
   Raul Martinez, Cuban-born mayor of Hialeah, has long said he'd
like to run for Congress, but spokesman Steve Bovo said Martinez
would wait to hear Gordon's decision.
   Other potential Democratic candidates include Commissioner
Kennedy, Miami Beach Mayor Alex Daoud, Dade County Commissioner Joe
Gersten, State Attorney Janet Reno and former school board chairman
Paul Cejas. Cejas and Kennedy are Cuban-born.
   In the 1988 elections, Florida gave George Bush his largest
margin in any state and Republicans gained a U.S. Senate seat, two
House seats and two state Cabinet jobs. Republicans then claimed a
10-9 majority in the congressional delegation when Rep. Bill Grant
of Tallahassee switched parties after the election.

<HEAD>Studies Show AIDS Decoy Drug May Reduce Virus</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A decoy drug designed to hopelessly confuse the
AIDS virus by mimicking its natural target is safe and may lower
levels of the lethal virus inside the body, researchers said
Tuesday.
   Scientists said they were encouraged by the results, but they
cautioned that testing is at an early stage, and no one can be sure
how effective the medicine will be in stopping AIDS.
   ``Nevertheless, this represents an exciting step forward,'' said
Dr. Ian Weller of Middlesex School of Medicine in England.
   The drug is known as soluble CD4, and it is one of more than a
dozen currently being used experimentally against the AIDS virus.
   So far, only one medicine, AZT, has been approved by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration for use against HIV, the AIDS virus.
While it can prolong the lives of people with AIDS, it does not
cure the disease, and it has a variety of toxic side effects.
   ``It's clear that we desperately need alternative treatments to
AZT,'' said Dr. Thomas Merigan of Stanford University.
   Reports on CD4 and other potential AIDS drugs were presented at
the 5th International Conference on AIDS, the major annual meeting
to review progress against the epidemic.
   Dr. James Mason, U.S. assistant secretary for health, said
progress in drug development ``is another success in our war
against this terrible infection.''
   Mason also it is increasingly important to set up voluntary
programs to contact sexual partners of HIV-infected people so they
will know of their risk of catching the virus.
   CD4 is one of a growing group of medicines that are specifically
designed to exploit the built-in weaknesses of the AIDS virus.
   In this case, the medicine is a synthetic copy of a molecule
called CD4. These molecules cover the surface of a particular
variety of blood cells known as helper T cells.
   These cells orchestrate the body's immune system, and they are
the chief targets of HIV. The virus finds them by zeroing in on CD4.
   Researchers reason that by flooding the bloodstream with copies
of CD4, the virus will mistakenly attack these decoys and miss the
blood cells.
   In preliminary studies on 18 people at the National Cancer
Institute, doctors found that short-term treatment with CD4
appeared to reduce the amount of virus in their bodies by about 50
percent.
   However, Dr. Robert Yarchoan, who directed the study, cautioned
that such fluctuations can occur naturally and might not have
resulted from the drug. None of the patients got better during the
19-day experiment.
   ``The results could have been better, but they could have been a
lot worse,'' Yarchoan said. ``I still have a lot of enthusiasm for
this approach. It has one of the best chances of therapeutic effect
with the least toxicity of anything being discussed right now.''
   A second preliminary study, conducted on 30 patients at San
Francisco General Hospital and New England Deaconess Hospital in
Boston, found no clear evidence of viral reduction.
   The two studies were intended primarily to determine how large a
dose of the medicine can be safely given.
   Dr. J. Davis Allan, who led the study at the Boston hospital,
said, ``I am very encouraged that the drug appears to be safe. The
study was not designed to detect subtle degrees of efficacy. We may
have not reached the effective dose yet.''
   Researchers hope to make CD4 last longer in the bloodstream by
chemically welding it to part of an antibody. They also have
developed another hybrid that joins CD4 with a poison, a
combination that might kill infected cells that make virus inside
the body.
   Merigan said that 17 experimental AIDS drugs are being given to
7,000 patients in studies sponsored by the U.S. National Institutes
of Health, and tests of six more will start soon.

<TEXT>
   An ordinance immediately banning the sale
of military-style assault weapons in unincorporated areas of
Alameda County was passed Tuesday by the county Board of
Supervisors.
   The 5-1 vote followed action by Gov. George Deukmejian and the
Legislature restricting the sale of more than 50 kinds of
semiautomatic assault weapons throughout California.
   Supervisor Don Perata said the Alameda County ordinance closes a
loophole in the state measure, which allows people to buy
semiautomatic weapons until January and to apply for permits to
keep them after January.
   The state law created a ``window of opportunity'' to buy the
weapons, Perata said.
   ``This ordinance intends to ban such sales immediately in the
county to prevent those who would evade the law from stockpiling an
arsenal while these weapons are still legally available,'' he said.
   He said he was concerned about weapon stockpiling by drug
dealers and others who have ``ravaged our communities.''

   Iranian opposition leaders predict they will return
from exile with the death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, but some
analysts believe history has passed them by.
   Former government officials and the son of the late, deposed
shah are granting interviews and issuing statements. The Mujahedeen
Khalq rebel army, based in Iraq, says its fighters are on alert and
awaiting the ``opportune moment to enter into action.''
   Former President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr said he ``certainly''
would leave his exile home outside Paris to return to Iran, but did
not say when.
   Reza Pahlavi, son of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, says Khomeini's
death opens a ``door to our success.'' The Shiite Moslem
patriarch's fundamentalist revolution overthrew the monarchy a
decade ago.
   Adm. Ahmad Madani, a former defense minister considered the dark
horse among the exiles, sees six months as a probable time for his
return.
   Fred Halliday, professor of international relations at the
London School of Economics, dismissed all the predictions and plans.
   ``None of them counts for anything,'' he said. ``They're all
has-beens of one kind or another. They all exaggerate their
importance. There are plenty of candidates inside Iran, and they
don't have to look for retreads.''
   Not every student of Iranian affairs makes such a blunt
assessment, but the consensus is that power struggles inside Iran
must run their course before outsiders will have a chance to enter
the fray.
   Khomeini died Saturday, 11 days after undergoing surgery for
internal bleeding. President Ali Khamenei, a junior cleric, was
chosen as caretaker leader.
   Opposition figures say, with rare unanimity, that the choice of
Khamenei reveals a vacuum in the Iranian leadership, the lack of a
replacement with the charisma of Khomeini. They predict initial
chaos, leading to a more moderate Iran.
   ``With Khomeini's death, the Islamic Republic died as well,''
Pahlavi, 27, said in a telephone interview. ``His passing away
leaves a much more direct door to our success.''
   Halliday, who follows Iranian events closely, said he believes
Pahlavi is the only opposition figure with a potential role to play
and that only a crisis will present the opportunity.
   ``He is a symbol of an alternative and by definition not
associated with the revolution or the current regime,'' Halliday
said. ``What he represents is a nostalgia for the past, plus
certain changes because he wouldn't go back to the old regime.
   ``He is the only one who would command significant respect in
contemporary Iran. The rest are just talking in Paris cafes.''
   Since the Iranian revolution put Khomeini in power in February
1979, politically active exiles and their leaders have clustered in
Paris. Khomeini, banished by the shah, directed his revolution from
France.
   In 1980, after his father died of cancer, Pahlavi took the crown
and became shah-in-exile. He says now, however, that restoring the
monarchy is not his goal.
   ``I positively believe that the monarchy is the most viable
alternative for the country, but my mission is not the restoration
of the monarchy,'' he said. His effort to unite the fractious
opposition shows no signs of bearing fruit, and many dismiss young
Pahlavi as the least plausible leader among the exiles.
   ``The regime of royalty was buried forever in the cemetery of
Iran's history,'' said Ayatollah Mehdi Rouhani, spiritual leader of
Europe's Shiite community.
   Safa Haeri, an Iranian journalist specializing in Asian and
Middle Eastern affairs, suggests Reza Pahlavi could return home
``in four or five years, if the moderates really consolidate
power.''
   He suggested Madani, the former defense minister, as possibly in
the best position to profit from the changes in Iran. Like some of
the others, Madani maintains contacts within the Tehran leadership.
   The Mujahadeen Khalq has vowed to topple the regime in Iran, but
they are heavily supported by neighboring Iraq. The Iraqis are
unlikely to endorse any immediate effort to invade Iran. Iraq and
Iran, despite differences on a permanent peace, are anxious to keep
alive their current cease-fire truce in their 8-year-old war.

   A former sewer worker dubbed the ``ski
mask rapist'' was sentenced Tuesday to 406 years in prison for his
117 felony-count convictions in the sexual assaults of 26 women.
   George Anthony Sanchez, 27, usually wore a ski mask when he
stalked his victims in several South Bay cities, police said. He
often tied up his victims, threatened them with a knife or pellet
gun, then sexually assaulted and robbed them.
   Sanchez's victims ranged in age from 16 to an 84-year-old woman
attacked in a church confessional during Thanksgiving.
   His string of assaults from 1985 to 1987 led police and women's
groups to offer public self-defense programs. Authorities said the
attacker often entered buildings through unlocked doors or windows,
often spoke little and rarely let his victims see his face.
   Sanchez was convicted earlier this year of 22 counts each of
rape, burglary and robbery and of 23 oral copulation charges, six
assaults with intent to commit rape, 17 sexual batteries, four
counts of sodomy and one count of penetration with a foreign object.

<TEXT>
   A year after flames swept through
Yellowstone National Park and the rest of the northern Rocky
Mountains, wildfire experts warn that things could get just as hot
this summer in California and the Southwest.
   ``We're dry, and it doesn't look real hopeful for getting into a
wet pattern,'' said Steve Brown of the National Weather Service,
staff meteorologist at the Boise Interagency Fire Center.
   Drought conditions have eased, if not ended, in Idaho and the
rest of the northern tier of states in the West. But they continue
unabated in the southern Rockies, Arizona, New Mexico and central
and Southern California, Brown said Tuesday at a briefing on the
region's fire season outlook.
   The Boise facility is the federal government's logistics and
support nerve center for firefighting activities across North
America.
   Spokesman Arnold Hartigan said the 27,587 wildfires reported
nationwide through Monday were almost 18,000 fewer than the same
date last year. But this year's fires are bigger. The 831,988 acres
burned through Monday was almost 300,000 acres more than in 1988.
   Most of the 1989 fires so far have been in Florida and the
Southwest, Hartigan said.
   Brown said Arizona and New Mexico have received only about 60
percent of normal precipitation since the current water year began
last October. California has received 100 percent statewide, but
most of that moisture has been in the north, leaving Southern
California dangerously dry.
   Idaho has received 102 percent of normal precipitation, thanks
to a fairly heavy winter snowpack and abnormally wet March, Brown
said.
   But even here, the soil is so dry after two years of drought
that it will take an additional 5 to 10 inches of precipitation,
particularly in southeastern Idaho and the central mountains,
before the drought can really be declared over.
   Idaho and most of the rest of the northern Rockies are expected
to get near normal precipitation through August, ``which isn't
much,'' Brown said. The outlook is bleaker in the Southwest, where
the only hope for improvement is the chance that monsoons will make
their way north from Mexico later in the summer.
   ``If we don't get that, it's going to be a long year,'' he said.
   Nationally, the Boise fire center's Hartigan said logistics
support is in place for the season, no matter how bad it gets.
   ``We always prepare for every fire season as if it's going to be
the worst in history,'' he said. ``For the past four or five years,
it's been doing its best to prove us right.''

   Dustin Hoffman is going to be a
graduate.
   The Oscar-winning star of ``Rain Man'' and ``Kramer vs. Kramer''
is to receive an honorary degree from his alma mater, Santa Monica
College, which he credits with pointing him toward an acting career.
   The college board voted unanimously Monday to give an honorary
associate in arts degree to Hoffman, who enrolled in the college to
study music in 1955 but changed to theater arts classes. He never
graduated.
   Superintendent Richard Moore said Hoffman sent word through his
agent that he would be honored to accept the degree. Hoffman is
currently appearing in London as Shylock in ``The Merchant of
Venice.''
   Details of when and where the degree will be presented will be
worked out between Hoffman's agent and college officials, Katz said.
   After graduating from Los Angeles High School in 1955, Hoffman
took his first classes in what was then called Santa Monica City
College.
   Hoffman has been nominated six times for Academy Awards,
including ``The Graduate,'' ``Midnight Cowboy,'' ``Lenny'' and
``Tootsie.''

<HEAD>Bentsen Moves To Ensure Fair Health Coverage For Lower-Paid Employees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, chairman of the Senate
Finance Committee, on Tuesday introduced a bill aimed at ensuring
that lower-paid workers get a fair share of employer-paid health
insurance coverage.
   The bill was signed by 32 other senators, including 15 members
of the Finance Committee. It would substitute for a much criticized
provision of the 1986 tax overhaul known as Section 89.
   ``Section 89 has a desirable goal _ that rank-and-file employees
should have tax-favored health and life benefits comparable to
those provided to other, well-paid employees _ but the road map for
getting there is too complicated for most American businesses to
understand,'' said Bentsen, D-Texas. ``It isn't working and even
the so-called experts can't understand the details.''
   The law requires employers to demonstrate, through complex and
often expensive tests, that their health insurance plans do not
discriminate in favor of higher-paid employees. That generally
means employees earning more than about $50,000 a year.
   Employers have complained loudly about the rules. In some cases,
critics say, employers have decided it would be simpler and less
expensive to drop all health coverage for all workers.
   The Treasury Department has delayed enforcement of the rules
until Oct. 1. There is strong pressure in Congress to repeal the
rules altogether. The Senate spent a good part of its session
Tuesday debating repeal.
   However, the Bush administration, Bentsen and Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, are calling for major changes, rather than repeal.
   Bentsen's bill would delay the rules until January. It would
view as non-discriminatory any plan that offered health insurance
to 90 percent of all employees with the employer paying at least 60
percent of the premium.
   Rostenkowski earlier introduced a bill that, in essence, would
accept any health plan that was available to 90 percent of
rank-and-file workers for an employee premium not exceeding $10 a
week for a single person or $20 for family coverage.

   Susan Butcher got a silver platter Tuesday in
honor of her athletic achievements. But her teammates won't hound
her about stealing the spotlight.
   Ms. Butcher said love and praise will be ample awards for the
dogs who helped her win the Iditarod Trail race three times in a
row.
   ``I love my dogs. I love living in the wilderness. I'm a lucky
person to have something I enjoy doing,'' said Ms. Butcher, who
came from rural Alaska to claim the 22nd annual Tanqueray Amateur
Athlete Achievement Award at a Manhattan luncheon.
   ``I'd never want to live here, but it's interesting and usually
fun,'' said Ms. Butcher, who visits the city several times a year.
   Her 1987 record of 11 days, 2 hours, 5 minutes and 13 seconds
still stands for the 1,200 mile dogsled race from Anchorage to
Nome, Alaska. She also won in 1986 and 1988, but came in second
this year when several dogs became ill.
   ``These are athletes, like any other athletes,'' Butcher said.
The 150 sled dogs she and her husband own have speed, endurance
``and the same thing I happen to have: drive and the competitive
spirit.''
   But she added that it's ``really a toss-up to say who's more
important'' _ the dogs or the trainer. ``Another person could take
my team and come in last.''
   Ms. Butcher, 33, a veterinary technician, began mushing dogs at
age 16 in her native Cambridge, Mass. She and her husband, fellow
musher Dave Monson, now live 70 miles from Manley Hot Springs,
Alaska, the nearest town.
   Besides giving Butcher the platter, the sponsor contributed
$5,000 in Butcher's name to the Delta Society, which trains people
and pets to visit nursing homes and hospitals.
   Fortuna, an 8-year-old Alaskan husky who once was one of
Butcher's dogs but retired after the 1987 Iditarod, was at the
ceremony. The 42-pound dog was adopted in October 1987 by Tom and
Ellen Measday of Livingston, N.J.
   ``For two weeks, she was silent. I think she was in mourning,''
said Mrs. Measday. But later, ``she seemed real happy to get all
the attention. She's not one of 150 dogs any more.''
   Fortuna now runs with the New Jersey Sled Dog Club.

   Workers kept pumping gas into a leaking pipeline
for nearly an hour after it already had blown to pieces, spawning a
fireball that engulfed two trains and turned scores of people into
ash, state-run media said Tuesday.
   Soviet news reports said at least 190 people died in the
pipeline blast early Sunday morning on the Trans-Siberian Railroad,
about 750 miles southeast of Moscow.
   Some of the 762 people who were hospitalized with injuries from
the blast are expected to die, according to television news program
``Vremya.'' It said said half of the injured had burns over more
than 70 percent of their bodies.
   More than 200 people still were missing, and some officials said
the final death toll could reach 500.
   Health Minister Yevgeny Chazov told the government newspaper
Izvestia that the third and fourth days are the most critical for
burn victims, and that Soviet doctors lack experience in treating
such severe burns.
   ``This lack of experience obviously is complicating our work,''
he said.
   Izvestia said doctors had determined 170 injured children needed
special equipment to help them breathe, and that they were
appealing for advice and urgent airlifts of equipment from West
Germany, Japan, the United States and Italy.
   A spokesman for U.S. industrialist Armand Hammer said 10 kidney
dialysis machines were being sent from the United States.
   The blast occurred when a pipeline carrying a highly flammable
mixture of benzene, propane and butane sprang a leak, filling a
forested valley with concentrations of gas. The gas was ignited by
a spark from one of the two trains on the Trans-Siberian line
nearby.
   The trains were traveling in opposite directions and had made
unscheduled stops in the valley in the Ural Mountains.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other officials have
charged that workers in charge of the pipeline noticed a drop in
pressure before the blast, but increased pressure instead of
shutting the line down.
   ``Vremya'' said Tuesday night that the workers continued to pump
gas through the pipeline for 55 minutes after the blast.
   An exasperated Gorbachev, briefing parliamentarians Monday after
he returned from the scene, cited ``incompetence, irresponsibility,
mismanagement, disgrace'' in the work of the pipeline.
   KGB chief Vladimir Kryuchkov, also speaking to Izvestia, said
the secret police had sent a team of investigators to the area near
Ufa to establish the truth.
   Kryuchkov said the KGB was carrying out a ``careful
investigation of the reasons and circumstances of this
extraordinary event. We understand the great difficultly of this
work.''
   The KGB ``will do all that's possible to establish the truth and
publicize the results of our work,'' he said.
   Kryuchkov said the KGB was working with prosecutors and the
Interior and Health ministries.
   The blast was heard 16 miles away, and the Soviet military chief
of staff, Gen. Mikhail A. Moiseyev, told the official Tass news
agency Monday that it had the power of 10,000 tons of TNT, or half
the power of the first atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima,
Japan.
   Many of the victims, including children on the way to summer
camp, were burned beyond recognition, said the Communist Party
daily Pravda.
   ``Identification of some of them is extremely difficult and in
some cases, nothing is left but ashes,'' Pravda said.
   The blast stripped the 2.5 miles of trees and turned rail
passenger cars into twisted hulks of charred metal.
   Dozens of airplanes and helicopters ferried the injured from the
site of the blast to hospitals in the nearby cities of Chelyabinsk
and Ufa. Izvestia said 65 of the most severely burned, including
eight children, had been brought to Moscow for treatment.

   The driver and lookout who aided in the murder
of rookie police Officer Edward Byrne, allegedly by order of a
jailed narcotics kingpin, were sentenced Tuesday to life in prison.
   Supreme Court Justice Thomas Demakos called the defendants,
Scott Cobb, 25, and Todd Scott, 20, unfit to live in society as he
reviewed a confession in which Cobb described Scott laughing at
Byrne's slaying.
   ``The first shot, he seen the cop's brains come out. He said
that's what he was laughing at. ... Dave said he had to pull Todd
from the other side of the cop car 'cause Todd's at the cop's car
laughing, hee-hee,'' Demakos read.
   Demakos sentenced each to 25 years to life for the murder and a
concurrent term of five to 15 years for gun possession.
   Demakos also declared that his last act as a judge would be to
remind the parole board in writing of his recommendation that the
prison doors never open for the two.
   Demakos made the same promise last month when he gave the same
maximum term to Philip Copeland, a co-defendant convicted of
setting up the hit on orders from Howard ``Pappy'' Mason. The
government said Mason decreed the killing as a sign of his
displeasure at being jailed on a gun charge.
   A jury is deliberating the case of a fourth defendant, David
McClary, the alleged triggerman, who was tried separately.
   Byrne, 22, was killed by five bullets on Feb. 26, 1988, as he
sat in his patrol car. He was guarding the home of a drug case
witness.
   Defense lawyers said their clients had not gotten a fair trial.
Demakos denied without comment a motion to set aside the guilty
verdict that was returned by a jury March 29.

   The impact of Jim Wright's fall from power was
stark and swift Tuesday, as the former House speaker remained in
his Capitol office while his successor of only an hour headed to a
White House meeting with the president.
   Even as Wright nominated Rep. Tom Foley of Washington as speaker
in a somber speech on the House floor, workers were trundling his
possessions out of the speaker's ceremonial office on
canvas-covered carts.
   Asked his plans as Foley prepared to take Wright's place at the
table with President Bush at a meeting on clean air legislation,
Wright replied: ``I have to get on the phone and call my wife.''
   A day earlier, Wright was sitting next to Bush as the
congressional leadership gathered with the president to discuss
foreign policy.
   The Fort Worth Democrat, a member of the House leadership for
the last 12 of his 34 years in Congress, spent his final moments as
speaker holding his regular pre-session news conference but
revealed little about his plans or his state of mind. He declared
simply, ``I feel fine.''
   Forced out of his leadership job over ethics questions, Wright
plans to resign his congressional seat later this month.
   In a week, Wright said, he would be ``enjoying life, I hope and
trust, rejoicing in the good portion that has followed me and the
opportunities that have been given me in life.''
   As giant orange trash cans waited to be filled with cardboard
boxes stuffed full of folders, frames and plaques in his staff's
adjacent office, Wright was asked if he had any parting words.
   ``I might express my appreciation to all of you for keeping a
robust discussion going,'' he told a room packed full of reporters.
``I might want to write a column or two. Someone suggested I should
become a columnist. It might be a good thing. In fact, I might
discover who these unnamed sources are.''
   Just 45 minutes before he was to nominate Foley before House
Democrats, Wright closeted himself in his office with notes written
the night before and wrote his last speech as speaker.
   A spokesman said Wright had not yet decided whether he would
move to his congressional district office in the Longworth House
Office Building until he resigns his seat. But it was clear that he
and his staff were being pushed quickly out of the speaker's
ceremonial office, although Wright also has a personal office in
the Capitol.
   A floor below, outside the dining room where Texas Democrats
have met for lunch on Wednesdays with Wright as their leader, Rep.
Bill Richardson, D-N.M., said he sensed an ``aura of hopefulness
mixed with sadness'' pervading the Capitol.
   ``For the first time in three months I feel upbeat because the
ascension of Foley promises a great deal in the area of rebuilding
the institution (of the House), which is at its lowest level,''
Richardson said.
   At the same time, he said he felt sadness for Wright, who had
campaigned for him and looked after New Mexico's interests in
Congress.
   ``But I've talked to the speaker and he's at peace with himself
and that made me feel better,'' Richardson said. ``He looks serene,
he looks comfortable ... In the last month he had looked
crestfallen.''
   Wright resigned after a year-long investigation by the House
ethics committee that cost more than $1.5 million and led to
allegations that Wright had violated House ethics rules 69 times.
   The allegations surrounded sales of Wright's book, ``Reflections
of a Public Man,'' his wife's employment by a family friend, Fort
Worth developer George Mallick, and his relationship with Mallick.
   While Texans mourned the loss of a Texas speaker and the clout
and influence he gave their delegation, many predicted the scrappy
former boxer from Weatherford would not disappear from the national
scene.
   ``He'll not whimper away and crawl into some hole somewhere,''
said Rep. Jim Chapman, D-Texas. He said Wright, a ``strong-willed
man with strong ideas,'' would probably want to continue to play a
part in national affairs _ writing, speaking or teaching.
   ``He is healthy and well and feeling good and he's going to be
able to contribute to political debate and thought for many
years,'' Chapman said. ``He's got too much talent to go off and
spend time in a boat and fish.''

   Solidarity says it does not want to govern
despite its overwhelming public mandate in Sunday's parliamentary
elections. But if the independent union won't, who will?
   That's the question facing both the opposition and government
authorities following Solidarity's big victory over the communist
party in the first largely democratic elections in the East bloc in
more than four decades.
   The communist Polish United Workers Party is making no secret of
the fact that it wants some sort of coalition or alliance with the
Solidarity-led opposition. As deputy government spokesman Zbyslaw
Rykowski said Tuesday, ``We need one another.''
   But Solidarity was born and thrived as an opposition movement
and has no appetite for assuming power in any way but through
completely unfettered elections in four years.
   Solidarity-endorsed candidates accumulated majorities of 70-80
percent Sunday in practically every race they entered. Out of 261
candidates for the two-chamber national legislature, it seems that
only eight failed to get the 50 percent of the vote needed to avoid
a runoff election on June 18.
   In a normal parliamentary democracy, Solidarity next would
peacefully assume the reins of power. But the Polish elections were
governed by the inescapable reality that Poland remains a communist
state. And so, before agreeing to the elections, authorities were
able to insist on reserving 65 percent of the parliament seats only
for communists and their allies.
   As it turned out, the communists were having trouble filling
even these ``guaranteed'' seats.
   Some of the party's best-known leaders, including Prime Minister
Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski and eight Politburo members, appear to have
been rejected by more than half the voters even though they ran
unopposed for parliament on a ``national list'' of 35 candidates.
   In a magnanimous gesture, the Solidarity leadership affirmed
Tuesday that it will live up to the 65 percent-35 percent division
of the parliament's lower house, the Sejm, that was provided for
under the April 3 accord between the union and government on
sweeping social reforms.
   But while that saves the party from having to stage a messy
court or parliament fight for its seats, it does not allay the
humiliation of the party's loss and the resulting undermining of
its standing at home and abroad.
   Everyone now understands that in fully free elections, the party
would not stand the slightest chance of winning office.
   Anticipating the loss of the ``national list'' in an informal
talk with reporters last week, senior Politburo member Jozef Czyrek
was blunt about the possibilities.
   Defeat of the list ``would be the biggest political joke ever
committed in Poland,'' he said, with Polish reform communists who
agreed to the elections being perceived as having committed
political suicide. ``They would be laughing like mad in Prague and
Berlin,'' two hardline communist capitals, he added.
   With its lack of support evident, the party is looking to
bolster itself by drawing Solidarity into a ``grand coalition.''
   Solidarity insists it wants to remain in opposition, but the
political weakness of the party makes that seem more and more
difficult. Because of its numbers in the Senate and Sejm and its
mass popular support, the independent union will have a huge say in
policy and appointments.
   For instance, no legislation will be able to get through the new
National Assembly without Solidarity votes. The Senate has a veto
over all bills, and the party lacks enough votes in the Sjm to
override the veto.
   There is also the question of naming a new president and forming
a new government after the new Sejm and Senate are seated.
   Theoretically, Rakowski could keep his post despite having been
denied a parliament seat. But it might be difficult for him to
function effectively as prime minister after such a loss of face,
and there likely will be calls for someone more popular with the
voters to head the government.
   Similarly, the Sejm and Senate are to meet together to name a
president, a newly created executive office with strong powers
under Poland's revamped constitution that was designed to be a
bulwark to keep Poland in the Soviet bloc.
   The presidential election was supposed to be a walkaway for
Polish party leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski because of the party's
built-in majority in the Sejm. But if the ``national list'' seats
are still vacant when the vote is taken, the party will have only a
small three-vote edge.
   There have been popular calls for Solidarity leader Lech Walesa
to offer himself as the opposition's candidate. Such calls are only
likely to increase given the Solidarity election performance.
   President Walesa? Such strange things are starting to look
possible now that Poland has started down the road of democracy.

   Noted Chinese dissident Fang Lizhi has been
permitted to take refuge in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, a State
Department official said Tuesday.
   The official, who spoke on condition that he not be identified,
had few details on the circumstances or timing of Fang's arrival,
but said he had been in the embassy since Monday at least.
   ``He took refuge there for his own safety,'' the official said.
   Fand, a 53-year-old astrophysicist who has backed the democracy
movement and called Marxism a failure, was prevented by Chinese
police from attending a dinner with President Bush during the
president's February visit to Beijing even though four less
prominent other dissidents were able to attend.
   Bush and Ambassador Winston Lord protested the police action and
the Chinese government in return said it resented the invitation to
Fang and should have been told of it in advance.
   In the United States, human rights advocates criticized Bush for
not being more assertive on the issue.

   A 14-year-old girl was raped and strangled in
her grandparents' home, where she had moved to get away from the
crime and drug abuse in Philadelphia, her teacher said.
   ``That's what makes this so sad,'' said Jewell Elliott, principal
of the school Andrea Nicole Thomas had attended.
   ``She came here to get away from violence and the things that
wrap young people up in the city,'' Elliott said. ``She said many
times she wanted to get away from that.''
   The girl's body was found Sunday, the same day her grandparents,
John and Elmira Hawkins, had left for a weeklong Florida vacation.
An autopsy showed she had been raped and strangled. An aunt
discovered the girl's body.
   The teen-ager was scheduled to graduate Saturday with the six
other members of the eighth grade at the Seventh Day Adventist
school.
   Elliott said Miss Thomas, who had two older brothers, went to
school in Philadelphia until sixth grade, when she asked to be
transferred. She returned to Philadelphia for seventh grade and then
asked to be sent back to West Pottsgrove Township near Stowe to
finish eighth grade, Elliott said.
   ``I would see her occasionally at church during her seventh-grade
year, when she would visit her grandparents up here,'' Elliott said.
``She would tell me that boys bothered her at school, that children
skip classes and she said, `I'm not being challenged,' and she
wanted to come back where she knew there was a challenge.''
   No arrests have been made, police said.

   Soldiers and civilians battled
mudslides and flood waters Tuesday to reach people left stranded
after a storms that killed at least 275 people.
   Twenty-five people also were reported missing following the
mudslides that buried their villages. At least 100,000 people were
left homeless and an equal number were temporarily displaced by the
flooding, relief officials said.
   The heavy rains eased Tuesday, but flood waters surging down the
hills forced at least 5,000 people from their homes near Colombo,
the coastal capital city.
   Navy boats and air force helicopters ferried food and medicine to
areas cut off by flood waters Tuesday and the army tried to dig
through mounds of earth blocking roads to the worst-hit areas.
   More than 100 people died in a mudslide that covered
Bulathkopitiya, a village of mud-and-thatch huts 35 miles northeast
of Colombo, Col. N.K.A. Angammana said. He said soldiers were using
bulldozers to open the road to Bulathkopitya, which is located in a
valley of coconut and rubber plantations.
   A total of 240 bodies were recovered in the Kegalle district,
which includes Bulathkopitya, Angammana said.
   Relief officials said the total death toll was 275.
   More than 8 inches of rain hit the area Saturday after a month of
monsoon rains drenched southwestern Sri Lanka, an island nation in
the Indian Ocean formerly known as Ceylon. Mud and boulders rolled
down the hillsides and floods swept through valleys from Kegalle
through the hill districts of Ratnapura and Nuwara Eliya, to coastal
Kalutara and Galle districts.
   The Kelaniya River, which skirts Colombo's northern suburbs, rose
20 to 30 feet, according to relief officials.

   The accomplishments of the 100th Congress will remain forever a
monument to your leadership.
   And to the great leaders of the Republican Party _ Gerald Ford,
who left this place to assume the presidency as a healing president
in a difficult time in our history, John Rhodes, and Bob Michel.
   And all of my colleagues, past and present, whose vision of the
country, though sometimes sharply different, was marked by a common
commitment to public service, shared concern for improving the
common good, and a love of this House.
   We are proud to call this the people's House, the fundamental
institution of American democracy.
   Although it is not the oldest parliament in the world, it has
existed longer as an independent, popularly elected legislature than
any other parliamentary body in history.
   As we watch the remarkable struggle of people in China, and the
growing aspirations of the people in the Soviet Union, Poland and
elsewhere to take control of their destiny, we should take great
pride that the values that gave this institution its birth and which
have flourished here and sustained us for two centuries now sweep
around the world.
   This body reflects most closely the nation at large.
   It is not, as many have suggested, a fixed, stagnant body.
   It is constantly refreshed by new members from every corner of
the country who have brought their ideas and energy to bear on
behalf of the people they represent.
   Only 7 percent of the House's current members were in the House
when I was first elected in 1964.
   Eighty-one percent of the current members have been elected since
1974.
   More than half of the current members _ 55 percent _ have been
elected since 1980.
   The constant change in membership is a source of great strength
for the House, but fundamentally, and more importantly, the House
reflects the will of the electorate.
   Our business here is the people's business.
   It is time to put divisiveness behind us, to reach out and
address the issues of national policy that members of both parties
are eager to consider.

<HEAD>WASHN: to consider.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   We must resolve to build support for schools that nourish the
love of learning and are free from drugs and violence.
   We must deal with the problem of homelessness.
   We must strive to put the country at the cutting edge of economic
innovation and the global economy.
   We must provide for the security of families, from child care to
health care.
   In a time of changing and uncertain circumstances, we must assure
our continued national security.
   We must solve our fiscal problems and protect the national and
global environment.
   On these and other important public issues, we must act
responsibly and resolutely.
   We will not reach any of these goals without a deep respect for
the House as an institution and a reaffirmation of the value of
public service.
   I have been a member of the House for 25 years.
   I take great pride, as we all do, in my profession.
   Election to public office is a free gift of a free people.
   The challenge for all of us in public life is to use that gift to
improve the conditions of those who have bestowed that enormous
trust and responsibility upon us.
   We must take pride in ourselves and in our institution.
   I am confident in the fundamental honesty and dedication of the
members of the House.
   The members of the House today meet and exceed standards of
personal conduct that are higher than at any time in our history.
   I recognize that controversy still exists in some areas, and will
address them.
   I have asked Bob Michel to join me in asking the bipartisan task
force on ethics to complete their work with deliberate speed so that
the House can consider these issues in this Congress, in this
session, in this year.
   The greatness of the House comes from its members working
collectively to address the nation's problems.
   No parliamentary body can survive for long without the basic
comity and trust necessary for us to address the nation's problems
in a constructive way.
   I do not believe we can successfully undertake our public
responsibility by tearing down this House, by abusing its
institutions.
   We cannot tolerate the continuance of the current distrust and
suspicion and expect to fulfill the public's expectations.
   After 25 years in the House, there should be no doubt that I am
proud to be a Democrat.
   I am deeply conscious, however, of the obligation I bear as
speaker of the House.
   I am speaker of the whole House, not of one party, but to each
and every member of the House, undivided by the center aisle.
   I pledge to protect the right and privileges of all members.
   I will seek the consultation, advice and counsel of leaders and
members, and I will welcome expressions of concern from all quarters
of the House.
   I have suggested to the Republican leader that we meet more
frequently to discuss business.
   He has encouraged more orderly and early cooperation on
developing the weekly program, and I welcome that suggestion.
   Together, we reiterate our commitment to the work of the ethics
task force, so that we can put this divisive period behind us.

   We warmly extend the same respect to President Bush, who has
offered to work with us in a spirit of bipartianship.
   I applaud the president's pledge of cooperation and am eager to
accept it.
   Without the cooperation of both branches we will not solve
pressing national problems.
   Politics involves the clash of ideas, and we will inevitably have
disagreements.
   We must be careful that our desire for comity and bipartisanship
does not deter us from considering contentious issues and debating
them vigorously.
   But we must be able to conduct our political battles in an
environment of respect for ourselves, for our opponents and for the
House.
   We cannot allow political differences to become foils for
personal antagonism.
   Let us debate and decide with intensity, even passionate
intensity, but let us debate and decide with respect, not rancor.
   A dozen years ago, Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill stood before the
House prepared to take the oath of office for the first time.
   In his speech, he paraphrased certain principles outlined by the
great Henry Clay that should guide the speaker.
   He promised to be prompt and impartial in deciding parliamentary
questions.
   He pledged to be patient, good-tempered, and courteous toward
individual members.
   He pledged best to employ the talent of the House for full and
fair consideration of issues that come before us.
   He pledged in those ``moments of agitation from which no
deliberative assembly is entirely exempt to remain cool and
unshaken, guarding the permanent laws and rules of the House from
being sacrificed to temporary passions, prejudices or interests.''
   I repeat that pledge to you today.
   You have bestowed upon me a great honor and a great
responsibility.
   I will devote every ability I have to maintaining your confidence
and the integrity of the House of Representatives and to protect the
rights and welfare of all members so that we can fulfill our high
responsibility in representing the people of this nation.
   With God's help, and with your understanding and support, I am
now prepared to take the oath of office.

<HEAD>Rigid Backslapping and Old-Shoe Chumminess: The House's Way</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House turned over authority with
handshakes and backslaps, with wisecracks and children in the
members' benches Tuesday, giving its new leader a chance to draw a
contrast with Moscow and Warsaw and the streets of Beijing.
   There were still bitter partisan words spoken in the lobbies of
a House whose wounds have not yet healed, but Thomas S. Foley's
cordial assumption of power as speaker and Jim Wright's surrender
were cited by Foley himself as symbolic of the values of the House.
   ``We are proud to call this the People's House,'' he said.
   Taking note of the street struggle in China and the grasping for
democratic formulas in Poland and the Soviet Union, he said America
could draw satisfaction ``that the values that gave this
institution its birth and which have flourished here and sustained
us for two centuries now sweep the world.''
   The House does these things its own way, with a mixture of rigid
ceremony and its customary old-shoe clubbiness.
   A voice familiar from State of the Union night bellowed out,
``Mr. Speaker! The speaker-elect, Thomas S. Foley of the state of
Washington!'' The doors parted and Foley marched down the handshake
route.
   Wright, having surrendered the speakership, left the dais and
joined the Democratic ranks. Along the way, he passed six children,
members' kids, here for the history of it all, one of them trying
out his sunglasses against the bright lights and another twirling a
sailor's cap.
   Wright, accused of ethical impropriety, announced last week that
he was innocent but quitting, a victim of ``mindless cannibalism.''
At Foley's instigation, Wright accepted a standing ovation. His
eyes glistened.
   Republican Robert Michel of Illinois made a joke of his own
inevitable defeat for the speakership. The Republicans dutifully
nominated him; the Democrats nominated Foley; the reading clerk
called out the names; the Republicans voted for Michel and the
Democrats for Foley, who won, 251 to 164.
   When the outcome was announced, Michel said he had become
``distressingly expert'' at having been outvoted in these
speakership elections _ it was his sixth _ and he hoped for the day
when the Democrats might be in the minority and learn ``the joys of
such selfish behavior.''
   The Democrats have been in the majority for 35 years, Michel
said, serious now, and so long a stretch of uninterrupted power
``can act like a corrosive acid upon the restraints of civility and
comity.''
   Moreover, he said, ``the distingushed members of the ethics
committee,'' who had been about to pass judgment on Wright when he
short-circuited the process, ``are neither mindless nor
cannibals.'' Wright had spoken of ``mindless cannibalism'' in his
resignation speech last week.
   So, not far from the surface, rancor remained.
   At the Republican caucus which had nominated him, Michel urged
rejection of two possible Republican courses toward the Democrats _
the ``kiss and make-up alternative'' and ``the French Revolution
alternative in which we knit the names of evil Democrats into a
waiting list for the political guillotine.''
   From the back of the room, some junior members replied
musically. They hummed _ loudly _ the French ``Marseillaise.''
   Nor did the day's sweetness suppress the Democrats' ire. Some
Democrats aver the Republicans are engaging in ``ethics wars''
which so far have forced Wright out, forced Tony Coelho of
California, the party's zealous whip, to quit rather than face an
ethics investigation and spread suspicions about another rising
Democrat, William H. Gray III of Pennsylvania, whose Memorial Day
visit by FBI agents quickly found its way into the newspapers.
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., told reporters leaking such news was
``unjustified character assassination.'' Rep. Patricia Schroeder,
D-Colo., accused GOP National Chairman Lee Atwater of spreading
venom while in the White House was ``George Bush being kind and
gentle, George saying, `Let's do horseshoeing, let's do
barbecues.'''

<HEAD>Chinese Media Silent on Crisis</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-China, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chinese media all but ceased to function
Tuesday with no mention of a deepening crisis in the national
leadership or of fighting between military units.
   The Xinhua News Agency, usually the mouthpiece of government
policy, issued no Chinese news, restricting itself to a few dozen
foreign stories and fixtures such as weather forecasts.
   Previously, Xinhua used its reports to convey the official line
on the weeks of student protests. The agency's silence seemed to
indicate that neither the conservatives who ordered Saturday's
military crackdown nor the liberals who opposed it are in a position
to dictate a new line.
   The nationally televised evening news was narrated entirely by
off-screen voices with no anchor and even skipped the usual
introduction: ``Viewers, this is the news broadcast. These are the
main stories.''
   Much of the 30-minute newscast was taken up by timeless feature
stories from other cities. It also replayed a video from traffic
monitors at several intersections in the city showing stone-throwing
and other attacks by civilians against troops arriving to enforce
martial law. There were no shots of troops firing on civilians.
   The only substantial news from television or any other official
media Tuesday was a statement by State Council spokesman Yuan Mu
that nearly 300 people had died and more than 7,000 were injured.
   State-run television also said 32 people were arrested, most for
allegedly attempting to set fire to buses.
   Yuan was shown sitting at a desk facing several rows of local
officials in a small meeting room, the first look inside the
government since Saturday.
   The television later broadcast a news conference by Yuan with
Chinese journalists, in which he urged them to do their work well
even though newspapers have not been distributed since Saturday. His
comment implied that some newspapers continued to print editions
even though they were not being delivered or sold on the street.
   China Central Television did not broadcast its daily
English-language newscast on Monday or Tuesday night, and all
stations ended their programming early.
   Telephone calls to television stations went unanswered.
   Many Chinese reporters had closely followed the weeks of student
pro-democracy protests that led to the May 20 declaration of martial
law and Saturday military attack. But since Saturday none have been
seen on the streets.

   House Republican leader Robert Michel on
Tuesday turned a normally ceremonial goodwill gesture toward the
new speaker into a scolding for the majority Democrats.
   Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., was elected speaker to replace Jim
Wright, D-Texas, who resigned rather than continue his battle
against charges that he violated House rules on outside income.
   Michel carried forth the tradition of introducing Foley to the
House, and then took it a step further _ reflecting increasing
frustration and pressure within Republican ranks after more than a
third of a century of Democratic control.
   ``Thirty-five years of uninterrupted power can act like a
corrosive acid upon the restraints of civility and comity,'' said
Michel, whose name was futilely put in nomination by the GOP for
the sixth time.
   The crisis in the House was not the fault of Jim Wright or, as
Wright contended in his resignation speech, to ``mindless
cannibalism,'' Michel said.
   ``It is a catchy phrase. But the distinguished members of the
ethics committee (which charged Wright) ... are neither mindless
nor cannibals,'' he said.
   ``I am all for putting an end to bitterness,'' Michel said. ``I
am all in favor of putting our House in Order. But we don't do so
by sweeping things under the rug.''
   When he finished hammering the Democrats, Michel handed Foley
the gavel.

   Archbishop Desmond Tutu said Tuesday
he was anguished by the failure of his fellow Anglican clergymen to
allow women to become priests, and he likened sex discrimination to
apartheid.
   Tutu, the first black to lead the Anglican church in southern
Africa, commented during a meeting of church officials.
   During a vote Saturday, 60 percent of the delegates approved the
ordination of women, but this fell short of the two-thirds majority
needed to change church rules.
   Tutu said Tuesday the outcome had caused him ``very deep anguish
and pain.''
   ``I am very deeply convinced about the rightness of the
ordination of women,'' he said. ``I believe it especially in view of
my own ministry in seeking to work for justice.
   ``I can't see how I can say I oppose apartheid because it refuses
to give access to people because of something they can't change, and
then say no to women.''
   Under apartheid, the white minority government refuses to allow
South Africa's black majority a vote in national affairs and
maintains segregated schools, hospitals and residential areas.

   Drenching rains continued to stall field work
in the parts of the nation while additional rain was needed in some
other areas where subsoil moisture is still low, the Agriculture
Department said Tuesday.
   Strong thunderstorms over the weekend brought heavy rains and
flooding to Oklahoma, northeast Texas and northwest Louisiana, where
three to five inches of rain were reported.
   ``Heavy rain also fell on the western Great Plains,'' the
department's 1989 Drought Task Force said in its weekly review.
``Scattered showers over the western Corn Belt brought rainfall of
up to one inch in eastern Nebraska and eastern Kansas.''
   Persistent rain was reported in the eastern Corn Belt, with
amounts of two to four inches in Indiana and Ohio.
   The National Weather Service's 30-day outlook for June calls for
near-normal to above-normal rain throughout the nation except for
below-normal amounts in southern California, the report said.
   In another report, the government's Joint Agricultural Weather
Facility operated by the Agriculture and Commerce departments said
that corn planting nationally was about 93 percent completed by June
4, four percentage points behind normal for the date.
   Planting continued to lag in Indiana, Ohio and Pennsylvania but
was complete or nearly complete in the other major corn states.
   Winter wheat, which suffered greatly from drought in many areas
since it was planted last fall, was reported in ``mostly fair to
poor'' condition. In Kansas, where the crop was hit hard by the dry
weather, winter wheat was turning color and beginning to ripen. In
Texas, the harvest was 8 percent completed, about 15 percentage
points behind normal for this time of the season.
   ``Rain slowed Oklahoma's (wheat) harvest and reduced the quality
of the unharvested crop,'' the report said. ``In Nebraska, Russian
wheat aphids and wheat streak mosaic were continuing problems in the
panhandle.''

<HEAD>Eds: Subs first 5 grafs to move up Gregg's name</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republicans boycotted a Senate Foreign
Relations Committee meeting Tuesday to protest a Democratic-led
probe into the background and truthfulness of Donald Gregg,
President Bush's choice as ambassador to South Korea.
   The investigation's focus is Gregg's possible link to the
Iran-Contra affair. The key questions: Did Gregg assist Oliver L.
North's secret mission to illegally resupply the Nicaraguan Contra
rebels and is he lying about it now?
   Democrats said they may fight the boycott by holding up Bush's
nominations to fill key State Department and diplomatic posts.
   As the new tensions surfaced in a long-simmering dispute, the
absence of GOP members prevented the committee from acting on a
$4.5 billion State Department authorization bill. Also pending was
a $11.5 billion two-year foreign aid authorization measure.
   Gregg, the target of the committee's investigation, served as
Bush's vice presidential national security adviser.
   On Tuesday, eight Democrats gathered to discuss the State
Department bill. The only Republican who showed up was Sen. Jesse
Helms of North Carolina, the panel's ranking GOP member, and he
walked out. A quorum of 10 members is necessary to permit the
committee to act on pending legislation or nominations.
   ``It's very apparent that we are unable to do business, that the
Republicans are objecting to the fact that a legitimate committee
inquiry is taking place into Donald Gregg,'' said Sen. John Kerry,
D-Mass.
   Complaining of ``wholesale boycott,'' Kerry told his Democratic
colleagues: ``I would hope the comity of this institution would not
lead to legitimate business being held up.''
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., who is leading the Gregg
investigation, complained that a lack of cooperation from the
administration is in itself delaying final action on Gregg.
   ``Late last month I sent several letters to administration
officials asking for documents and information relating to Gregg,''
Cranston said. ``I not only have received no material, I have
received no response.''
   Helms said that the boycott is being organized by Sen. Mitch
McConnell, R-Ky., who, Helms said, wants a specific date set for
holding another hearing on Gregg and a specific date for voting on
his nomination.
   ``I don't want anyone suggesting we're holding up anything,''
Helms said. ``We've got a vendetta going on against Mr. Gregg.
That's been clear from the beginning.''
   ``This is an attempt to dredge up Iran-Contra,'' said Helms.
``I'm having a problem on my side because of their discontent over
what Senator Cranston is doing.''
   At that point, Chairman Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., attempted to
move for action on the pending measure.
   Helms stood up.
   ``I'll see you later, Mr. Chairman,'' he said. ``I've got to
defend my side.''
   Helms then walked from the room.
   After huddling with Democratic members, Cranston told reporters
that if Republicans want delay, they are likely to get it.
   ``We may not determine anything for awhile,'' Cranston said.
``This committee may not have any hearings on anything, including
Gregg. ... If this committee can't meet on anything else, maybe the
committee also can't meet on Gregg.''
   The White House and State Department have been urging quick
actions on a nummber of the pending nominations, including those of
Bernard Aronson to be assistant secretary of state for Latin
American affairs and John Kelly to be assistant secretary of Middle
Eastern and South Asian affairs.
   Pell complained that nominations confirmed to date have been
done so with little or no help from Republicans.
   ``We have to carry water for the administration,'' Pell said.
``Their own side is not carrying water.''

<HEAD>ACLU, Gay Groups Question AIDS List Proposal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A proposal to collect the names of New Yorkers
infected with the AIDS virus was condemned Tuesday by gay rights
groups and the ACLU as a move that could turn those needing help
away from medical attention.
   ``Our feeling is that anonymity has been the cornerstone of
success in AIDS strategy in New York City. No matter which direction
the epidemic goes, that should not be changed,'' said Clarissa
Cunningham, spokeswoman for the Gay Men's Health Crisis.
   ``If it is, it will drive people underground, away from the
health care that they need.''
   Ms. Cunningham cited statistics from South Carolina as backing
her assertion. After the state required the health department
receive the name of anyone testing positive for the AIDS virus, the
number of tests dropped 50 percent.
   Under the plan proposed Monday by city Health Commissioner Dr.
Stephen Joseph, the city would collect the names of people testing
positive for the virus in order to contact sexual partners or people
who shared needles.
   New York is now one of eight states where anonymous records are
kept of people who test positive.
   Joseph's proposal, made at the Fifth Annual AIDS International
Conference in Montreal, prompted members of the AIDS Coalition to
Unleash Power to disrupt his speech by standing with their backs
toward him and screaming that the commissioner was a liar and
murderer.
   ``You are going to drive us underground!'' ACT UP member Peter
Staley shouted at Joseph during an exchange at the conference.
   While Joseph said he felt confidentiality could be protected,
William Rubenstein of the American Civil Liberties Union said his
group has been opposed to such name-collecting plans since they were
first proposed.
   ``The problem with keeping lists is the potential for
confidentiality violations and possible prejudicial treatment. These
are our civil liberties concerns,'' said Rubenstein.
   Joseph's plan received endorsement Tuesday from City Council
Health Commission Chairman Joseph Lisa, who called the proposal ``an
extremely responsible public health measure.
   ``This will go a significant way to protecting the public,
especially women in the city of New York who are being infected at a
four times greater rate than heterosexual men,'' said Lisa.

<HEAD>Iowa Crewmen Ready To Go To Sea</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sailors on the battleship USS Iowa said
Tuesday they are ready to return to sea even though Navy
investigators have not found the cause of a gun turret explosion
that killed 47 crewmen in April.
   ``We'd like to shoot those guns,'' said Rick, a fire control
crewman aboard the battleship. ``It's like falling off that horse.
You've got to get back on it. The longer you wait, the more you're
going to think about it.''
   Lt. Cmdr. Brad Goforth, a ship spokesman, asked that crewmen's
last names not be used because the ship may run into danger during
its cruise to the Mediterranean Sea.
   Rick and seven other Iowa crewmen and spouses took a break from
preparing for a six-month deployment that begins Wednesday to talk
at the Norfolk Naval Station.
   The crewmen and the spouses were in good spirits about the
deployment, the ship's first since the April 19 explosion in gun
turret No. 2 killed 47 crewmen during a training exercise.
   ``The wives that I've spoken with are very supportive of this
deployment, possibly even more so than ordinarily,'' said Becky,
wife of the ship's senior chief.
   ``Deployments are hard ... whether an accident's been involved or
not,'' said Kathy, who stood at a pier beside the ship with her
husband, Michael, a machinist's mate second class.
   Michael, an Iowa crewmen for four years, said the crew's morale
was fairly good.
   ``I've seen it higher but it's not too bad,'' he said. ``We've
got a lot of work to do. We don't have time to sit and mope about
what happened.''
   Along with the usual preparations for six months at sea, the Iowa
crew had to clean and make minor repairs to the No. 2 turret. That
turret must undergo about $13 million worth of repairs, at the
Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth after the ship returns, before
its 16-inch guns can be fired, the Navy said.
   The ship's other 16-inch guns also will not be fired until the
Navy completes its investigation of the accident. The Iowa will be
able to use its six five-inch guns and surface-to-surface missiles.
   The No. 2 turret will be used during the cruise to train new
crewmen who replaced the sailors who died in the explosion, Goforth
said.
   The crewmen said they have discussed the various theories about

<HEAD>Drastic Tightening of Ceramic Pitcher Standard Planned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday
it planned a 50-fold reduction in the amount of lead permitted to
reach beverages from ceramic pitchers because of new evidence that
extremely small amounts of lead can hurt children.
   Lead at concentrations tolerable by adults can limit body growth
and intelligence of children and can cause brain damage and behavior
problems.
   Lead in pitchers comes from the glaze commonly used to make
ceramics smooth and impervious.
   Officials are most concerned about acidic liquids like orange
juice eating away at the glaze and causing lead to leach. Small
cream pitchers would not be subject to the new standard since they
are not used for acidic liquids.
   The FDA is proposing to allow pitchers to be sold only if they
leach no more than 0.1 micrograms, or one-tenth of a millionth of a
gram, of lead per milliliter of an acidic test solution. Currently,
pitchers are allowed to leach up to 5 micrograms of lead per
millileter.
   The proposal also would require that high-lead decorative and
commemorative ceramic plates have fired into them a permanent
warning that cautions ``Not for Food Use _ May Poison Food,'' or
have holes so they can't be used for food.
   The current standard was set by FDA in 1979 based on
recommendations of the World Health Organization. However, as a
result of the recent studies, the federal Centers for Disease
Control and the WHO have reduced their recommended maximum levels.
   The proposed regulation was published in the Federal Register
last Thursday. After a 60-day comment period, the FDA will issue
final rules.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Seek to Save Owners Billions in Bailout of Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Several House Republicans and a Democratic
subcommittee chairman united Tuesday behind an attempt to save
owners of 150 to 240 savings and loan facilities billions of
dollars in a bailout of the industry.
   The effort was aimed at weakening legislation demanded by
President Bush and pushed through several committees by liberal
Democrats to make S&amp;L owners put $6.4 billion more of their own
money at risk as a price for the $143 billion bailout, the biggest
in the nation's history.
   Of 10 proposals to reduce the amount of new capital that S&amp;Ls
would have to raise, an amendment by Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill.,
appeared headed toward becoming the vehicle for opposing Bush's
plan when the bill reaches the House floor next week.
   ``Of the amendments that deal with that issue, I think it is the
most precise,'' said Rep. Charles Pashayan Jr., R-Calif., a member
of the House Rules Committee.
   The committee spent most of Tuesday deciding which of 109
offered amendments will be allowed to be taken up when the full
House debates and votes on the 290-page bill. Another meeting was
scheduled for Wednesday.
   In addition to the capital standards, the rules panel was
expected to approve floor consideration of an amendment by the Ways
and Means Committee to add the $50 billion immediate taxpayer share
of the bailout's cost to the federal budget deficit for the next
three years.
   Bush has proposed financing the government share of the bailout
through long-term capital bonds that would add only $4.5 billion in
interest costs to the deficit in fiscal 1989, 1990 and 1991. And
administration officials have vowed to recommend that he veto any
measure that tampers with the financing.
   Republicans also were demanding floor votes on amendments to
undo a pair of administration-opposed housing measures added to
Bush's package by the House Banking Committee.
   One would make S&amp;Ls subsidize low-income home mortgages by $75
million to $150 million a year. The other would give poor families
first crack at buying some of the tens of billions of dollars in
residential property that has fallen into the government's hands as
the result of defaults on loans by insolvent thrift institutions.
   Both of the housing measures as well as making the bailout's
costs part of the federal deficit were rejected by the Senate,
which passed its version of the bill in April.
   Other amendments appeared headed for floor votes in the House
included putting a cap on government borrowing for the bailout and
restoring proposed $1 million-a-day civil penalites for bank fraud
and other S&amp;L crimes.
   Bush had demanded the $1 million civil penalties to discourage
fraud and embezzlement, which has been blamed by government
officials for more than half of the estimated $100 billion in S&amp;L
losses over the past five years.
   However, in response to an intense lobbying effort by the
American Bankers Association and other trade groups, the House
Judiciary Committee two weeks ago amended the bill to allow civil
damages of only twice what the government has lost as a result of
the wrongdoing.
   Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., chairman of the financial
institutions subcommittee of the House Banking Committee,
complained that bankers and other financial officers will be able
to escape civil fines for fraud if examiners catch them at it
before the losses become severe.
   ``How can we favor almost meaningless penalties for financial
crooks?'' Annunzio said, seeking a floor vote on an amendment to
restore Bush's proposal.
   But the biggest fight was over the capital requirements. And on
that issue, Annunzio was at the forefront with several House
Republicans in endorsing Hyde's amendment to weaken Bush's plan.
   Hyde's proposal would make the government go through lengthy
judicial hearings before requiring newcash infusions from 241 S&amp;Ls
granted so-called ``supervisory good will'' exemptions from capital
standards in the early 1980s.
   The exemptions, some extending for as long as up to 40 years,
were granted to then-healthy S&amp;Ls for taking over failing thrifts
at the government's request. The purpose was to preserve the
solvency of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which
guarantees depositors against losses up to $100,000 each.
   ``This policy saved the American taxpayers over $13 billion at
the time,'' said Hyde. He added that ``virtually everyone agrees
that these mergers never would have taken place but for the fact
that good will was part of the bargain. Due process and fundamental
fairness are concepts that cannot be tossed aside simply because of
the latest crisis.''
   However, supporters of Bush's plan to make S&amp;L owners put up
their own money as a ``cushion'' between possible future losses and
the government's deposit insurance funds, said good will has no
cash value.
   ``You cannot count air has hard cash and good will is just
air,'' said Rep. Henry Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the House
Banking Committee.

<HEAD>Two Studies Contradictory On Airline Hub Concentration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two major studies of the airline industry put
radically different slants on the impact of airline hub operations
on competition and air fares.
   A study by the General Accounting Office to be released at a
Senate hearing Wednesday says airlines charge an average of 27
percent more per passenger mile on flights to and from 15 major hub
airports than at other airports included in the study. The
Associated Press obtained an advance copy of the study.
   But a study by the airline industry released Tuesday says average
airline fares have decreased since deregulation of the industry in
1978 and fares at 30 hub airports are only 1.5 percent above the
industry average. That study says hub fares are a little higher
primarily because hubs tend to have more non-stop flights.
   Both studies are to be discussed on Wednesday at a hearing of the
Commerce, Science and Trasporation subcommittee on aviation, which
is examining the airline practice of feeding many of their flights
through a single airport.
   The study by the GAO, which is the investigative arm of Congress,
concludes the trend that has seen major airlines dominating flights
at airports where they set up hub operations has decreased
competition.
   ``Many travelers have less choice among airlines as more markets
are being controlled by a single airline,'' the study says.
   The report says that although the number of destinations served
from hub airports studied increased 10 percent between May 1985 and
May 1988, most of the increases were by dominant carriers and were
offset by large service reductions by other carriers.
   At 13 of the 15 hubs studied, average air fares per passenger
mile were higher for dominant carriers than for other airlines
serving the same airports, the report said.
   ``Hubbing generates important operating efficiencies, but it can
also lead to substantial market power for the airlines, which could
lead to higher fares and reduced levels of service,'' GAO official
Kenneth M. Mead said in testimony prepared for the subcommittee
hearing.
   The industry study conducted by the aviation consulting firm of
Simat, Helliesen &amp; Eichner concludes that competition in individual
markets has increased despite the greater concentration within the
industry and at some airports.
   The study commissioned by the Air Transport Association, which
represents major airlines, concludes there is little, if any,
relationship between average fares and airline concentraiton at
either hub or non-hub airports.
   ``The hub and spoke system has evolved into a highly competitive
national transportation system which provides enormous benefits to
the American public,'' said Robert Aaronson, ATA president.
   The ATA study says better service, such as more non-stop flights,
account for average fare levels at some hubs that are higher than
the industry average.
   But, in analysing the study, the association said passengers are
not hostage to the higher fares because cheaper options are
available, including multi-stop flights or connecting flights.
   Airline schedules at 25 non-hub airports show they are now served
by nearly twice as many airlines as in 1978, when the airline
industry was deregulated, the ATA study said.
   The ATA study includes charts which show that in 1978 nearly half
of all airline passengers traveled in markets where a single carrier
had 70 percent or more of the flights, but in 1988, only 20 percent
of passengers traveled in markets that were served by only one
airline.
   ``The growth of the number of hubs and the expansion of service
at them have had astonishingly beneficial consequences for the
typical spoke community,'' the ATA said.

   Police chiefs who support gun control do not
represent police in the field, a group of officers from around the
country who oppose limiting access to semiautomatic assault-style
weapons said Tuesday.
   About 225 officers brought to the Capitol by the National Rifle
Association from 49 states _ Hawaii was not represented _ held a
news conference before fanning out to pitch their views to members
of Congress.
   They were here to combat the impact of law enforcement officials
such as Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates and Baltimore County
Police Chief Neil Behan, who are pushing for controls on the
assault-style weapons, including semiautomatic versions of the
AK-47 and Uzi.
   Law enforcement groups that have taken similar stands include
the National Fraternal Order of Police, the International
Association of Chiefs of Police, the National Sheriff's
Association, the National Association of Police Organizations and
the Police Executive Research Forum.
   ``Often you, as news media, hear from the chiefs, the appointed
officials, and they say they speak for us,'' said Patrolman Ray
Maples, president of the Memphis Police Association. ``I'm here
telling you this morning for thousands of us out there that the
chiefs, the appointed officials, do not speak for the law
enforcement officers that are in the field, in the trenches, doing
the job.''
   But Stephen Brown, counsel to the National Fraternal Order of
Police, said his organization represents 200,000 police officers,
not their bosses.
   ``The Fraternal Order of Police does speak for the cop on the
street,'' Brown said. ``There's no chiefs, there's no sheriffs.
They don't speak for anyone except for the cops on the beat.''
   Attending the news conference to express support for the
officers brought in by the NRA were Reps. Larry E. Craig, R-Idaho,
Larkin I. Smith, R-Miss., Harold L. Volkmer, D-Mo., and Ron
Marlenee, R-Mont., as well as Sen. James A. McClure, R-Idaho.
   Lt. Harry Thomas of the Cincinnati Police Department noted that
many of the officers attending were ``under direct orders from
their police chiefs to disassociate themselves from their
respective police departments.''
   ``Some of us are here with our chiefs' blessings, and some of
our chiefs are hoping our planes go down on the way home,'' Thomas
said. ``The remarks that are made here should not be construed as
the official policy of our respective police departments.''
   Officer Leroy Pyle of the San Jose Police Department in
California said it ``offends me'' that some law enforcement leaders
say police are being ``outgunned'' by criminals with assault-style
weapons.
   ``Some of those administrators who are saying that are
repeatedly saying that policemen are afraid, that the policemen are
outgunned, that we're losing. ...We didn't come to this job to
lose, and we don't want anybody saying we're losers,'' he said.
   ``We go out there. We use education, training, tactics and good
common sense. And we win,'' he said.
   The officers said they feared moves to limit access to the
weapons was just the first step toward disarmament of the
population. Thomas noted that in Beijing unarmed demonstrators were
gunned down by army troops.

   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's political
will, read to Iran's parliament, sternly criticized the United
States as a ``vile state terrorist'' and said Iran's leaders must be
concerned with serving Islam and the deprived.
   Khomeini's son Ahmad read excerpts Monday on Tehran radio. On
Tuesday, state television broadcast film of President Ali Khamenei
reading the testament to parliament on Sunday. Khamenei was chosen
Sunday as caretaker leader.
   It was not known whether Khamenei read the entire 29-page
document, which official media said was dated Feb. 15, 1983, with
another page added in 1987. They did not say what was contained in
the extra page.
   Those parts of the will made public said nothing of who should
govern Iran but contained general observations on how to choose the
leaders.
   ``My will to the leadership is that they should occupy themselves
with serving Islam, the Islamic republic, the oppressed and the
deprived,'' Khamenei read.
   ``They should not think that leadership is an egotistical gift.
... It is a heavy, dangerous responsibility. If the experts in
choosing a leadership council or leader consult with prominent
theologians and independent scholars, many problems ... will not
arise.''
   There has been speculation that, in the absence of a single
political figure of Khomeini's stature, Iran may be ruled by a
collective leadership.
   The testament said the president and members of the parliament
should come ``from a class that has felt the deprivation of the
oppressed and will work to better their conditions,'' not from ``the
well-off capitalists and landlords, drowned in pleasures and
excesses.''
   Earlier, official media carried these excerpts:
   ``I have done my duty, which is to give guidance. My hope is that
you will listen to this advice, which will reach you after my death
and is unstained by the desire for power, and save yourself from
God's wrath.
   ``There should be no doubt that the Islamic revolution of Iran is
separate from all other revolutions, in the quality of its struggle
and in its motives.
   ``I have not said and I will not say that today, in this
republic, the great Islam and all its aspects are being implemented
and that ignorant and disorderly individuals are not committing acts
against Islamic laws.
   ``But what I do say is that the legislative, judicial and
executive branches are trying and will try to do a great deal to
make the country Islamic.''
   It is ``better to be wiped out honorably from the face of history
by the hands of criminal Americans and Soviets ... than to have a
super-comfortable life under the red flag of the East and the black
flag of the West,'' Khomeini declared.
   He said Iran had no greater source of pride ``than the fact that
the U.S. with all its huge military arsenal and string of puppet
regimes and the international mass media at its service, has been so
disgraced and humbled against Iran that it does not know to whom it
should resort.''
   Khmomeini said Iran should guard against ``the conspiracies and
plots of the enemies towards the Islamic Republic. In the forefront
of these is America, this vile state terrorist, which has set fire
to the whole world, and its ally the global Zionist (Israel), which
to attain its goals commits such crimes that pens are ashamed to
document and tongues are ashamed to recite.''
   Of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, his foe in an eight-year war,
and some Arab leaders who supported Iraq, he said:
   ``We are proud that our enemy is Saddam, whom friends and foes
alike recognize as criminal, and violator of international and human
rights. And everyone knows that his treachery to the nation of Iraq,
and the gulf sheikdoms, is not less than his treachery to the
Iranian nation.
   ``The Islamic countries and the oppressed of the world are proud
that their enemies are this Jordanian Hussein the carpetbagger and
Hassan and Hosni Mubarak are followers of Israel the criminal.''
   His references were to the kings of Jordan and Morocco and the
president of Egypt.

<TEXT>
   A 400-pound bomb packed into a
hijacked van shook the city center Tuesday, injured three elderly
women and heavily damaged a multimillion-dollar complex under
construction, police said.
   The outlawed Irish Republican Army, fighting to drive the British
out of Northern Ireland, claimed responsibility in telephone
warnings to local businesses, police said.
   They were evacuating the area when the bomb exploded 40 minutes
after an armed man forced his way past security guards and abandoned
the van in Castle Court complex, a police spokesman said. The $94
million complex was to open next spring.
   A British Army bomb disposal team arrived minutes before the
blast but did not have time to defuse the device, police said.
   The huge explosion shattered windows in surrounding shops and
offices.
   Three women, all in their 70s, were treated in the hospital for
cuts and shock, the spokesman said.
   Northern Ireland Secretary Tom King, the province's senior
British official, branded the IRA ``godfathers of unemployment.''
   ``What on earth is the purpose of carrying this out?'' he asked.
``It is destroying jobs, destroying buildings and destroying the
future for many people and their families.''
   Lord Mayor Reg Empie said he was to meet more than a dozen
British retail executives Wednesday, and ``I have less than 24 hours
to think up reasons why they should still come to Belfast.''
   It was the third IRA bomb attack on the complex. A small bomb
exploded on a crane and two soldiers from the locally recruited
Ulster Defense Regiment were killed when a bomb exploded in front of
the building in February 1987.
   The IRA is fighting to unite the predominantly Protestant
province with the mainly Roman Catholic Republic of Ireland under a
leftist administration.

<HEAD>Bush Offers U.S. Burn Specialists for Soviet Pipeline Explosion Victims</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush visited the Soviet Embassy on
Tuesday to express sympathy for victims of the deadly gas explosion
along the Trans-Siberian Railway and to offer a team of U.S. burn
specialists.
   Bush told Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin that the United States
could send a team of 14 doctors from the Brooke Army Hospital at
Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas, one of the nation's most
respected burn centers.
   ``I just want you to know it's available... They could be ready
to go immediately,'' Bush told Dubinin. The ambassador thanked Bush
for the ``generous offer'' and said he would relay it at once to
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``You've had more than your share of terrible luck,'' Bush told
Dubinin, mentioning both the freak weekend gas explosion in the Ural
mountains and the devastating earthquake earlier this year in Soviet
Armenia.
   At least 190 people died, 762 were hospitalized and another 250
were missing in the Sunday incident in which two passenger trains
were engulfed by a wall of fire from a ruptured gas pipeline,
according to Tass, the Soviet news agency.
   Bush told Dubinin that the Soviets could take or decline the team
of burn specialists as they wished. ``This is an offer and it may or
may not be something you would want to accept in the final
analysis,'' Bush said.
   He said he knew the Soviet Union had its own burn specialists,
but he said the Fort Sam Houston unit was ``an outstanding burn
center.''
   Bush said the offer included bringing ``some worst cases _ if it
fits your requirements _ to San Antonio.''
   Bush sat at a table covered with red cloth and bordered by black
ribbons in an upstairs room at the embassy,. With Dubinin looking
on, he wrote in the guest book: ``With sympathy _ please convey our
most sincere condolences. George Bush. 6 June 89.''
   Bush and National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft also looked at
an exhibit of photographs from the gas explosion.
   Before heading back to the White House, Bush met privately with
Dubinin for about 10 minutes.

<HEAD>Soviets Boost Record Buys of U.S. Grain By 400,000 Tons</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has bought an additional
400,000 metric tons of U.S. corn and sorghum for delivery this year
under a long-term agreement, the Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   The grain, 300,000 tons of corn and 100,000 tons of sorghum, is
scheduled for delivery through Aug. 31. Sales were handled by
private exporters under terms of the current long-term grain supply
agreement between the two countries.
   Moscow's grain purchases have been at record levels for weeks,
far surpassing China's recent buying surge.
   Officials said the latest sales boosted total U.S. corn and wheat
sales to the Soviets in 1988-89 to a record 20.5 million tons,
including more than 15.9 million tons of corn and 4.6 million tons
of wheat.
   The sales also include 442,500 tons of soybeans, 1.35 million
tons of soybean meal, and more than 1 million tons of grain sorghum.
   China, meanwhile, was the American wheat farmer's leading foreign
buyer in the 1988-89 marketing year, with purchases of about 8.3
million tons. In addition, China has bought about 2.9 million tons
of U.S. wheat for delivery in the 1989-90 marketing year that began
June 1, including 1.8 million tons announced by USDA on Monday.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 300,000 tons of
corn sold to the Soviets would be about 11.8 million bushels.
   Corn prices have been averaging about $2.49 per bushel at the
farm level, according to the latest USDA five-day average, meaning
that the latest sale could have a farm value of around $29 million.
   The sorghum, also at 39.4 bushels per ton, recently has been
about $2.20 per bushel and would be worth approximately $8.7 million.
   Wheat sales to the Soviet Union have been subsidized under the
department's Export Enhancement Program, or EEP. But the corn and
other commodities are not subsidized.
   China had been a regular wheat buyer under EEP but has not bought
any under the subsidy program since April 6 when 300,000 tons were
reported for delivery in the 1989-90 marketing year, said Jean
Nollmeyer of the department's Foreign Agricultural Service.
   But since then, she said, China has bought about 2.6 million tons
of wheat for 1989-90 delivery. All of that has been at non-subsidy
prices, even though China still has about 910,000 tons remaining in
its EEP account.
   World grain prices have risen significantly in the last year,
resulting in lower U.S. subsidy rates. At one time under EEP, the
wheat subsidy was more than $40 per ton, or around $1.08 per bushel.
In China's most recent EEP deal, the subsidy was $6.33 per ton, or
about 17 cents per bushel.

<HEAD>Freed ANC Leader Confers With Mandela At Prison</HEAD>

   Imprisoned black leader Nelson
Mandela was allowed a visit Tuesday from Govan Mbeki, the
highest-ranking African National Congress member at liberty in South
Africa.
   Mbeki, 78, received unexpected permission for the visit after
being turned down several times since his release from prison in
November 1987.
   It is not known what the veteran black nationalists discussed
because Mbeki is barred from being quoted by the press. No other
source of information was available.
   Mbeki spent about 2{ hours at Victor Verster prison farm in
Paarl, outside Cape Town, but the exact length of his meeting with
South Africa's most popular leader was not disclosed. The two last
met shortly before Mbeki was freed.
   They were among eight African National Congress leaders sentenced
to life imprisonment in 1964 for plotting to sabotage the government.
   Farida Omar, an anti-apartheid activist from Cape Town, said she
was with Mbeki when he received a telephone call Tuesday morning
informing him the visit had been approved.
   ``He was very thrilled,'' she said.
   Rumors of Mandela's possible release have been circulating in
South Africa for more than a decade, and the government gives no
firm indication of its plans. However, the decision last year to
move him to a suburban-style ranch house on a prison farm revealed
the special status he has even as an inmate.
   Mandela, 70, has refused offers of freedom on condition he
renounces the use of violence in the fight to topple the white-led
government.
   There is speculation that Mandela may be released after national
elections in September for whites, Indians and people of mixed-race.
The 28 million blacks have no vote in national affairs.
   Mbeki was freed unconditionally because he was ailing, but a
month later was placed under harsh restrictions prohibiting him from
leaving his hometown of Port Elizabeth without permission. He has
been allowed periodic visits to Cape Town for medical treatment.

   The world's largest prefabricated power plant
began a slow journey Tuesday under tow up the Mississippi River, the
same body of water that it eventually will use to generate
electricity.
   Cables groaned when two tugboats in front pulled and two tugs in
back pushed the massive power plant, the Merrimac, off a dry dock at
a suburban New Orleans shipyard to begin its 208-mile journey
upriver.
   ``I feel real good. I've been working on this thing for 13 years.
We started literally from scratch,'' said Sidney Murray of
Catalyst-Old River Hydroelectric Ltd., one of the investors. ``It's
been exciting for everybody.''
   Murray videotaped the 12-story beige structure as it edged away
from its dock. About 75 spectators cheered from the dock.
   The power plant is 12 stories high, 456 feet long and weighs
about 25,000 tons. Company officials said that although the Merrimac
is smaller than some of the world's largest ships, it is believed to
be the largest structure to ever travel up the Mississippi River.
   The Merrimac is headed for a point 40 miles south of Vidalia,
where it will be fitted for operation in a channel where water will
run from the Mississippi River through the power plant turbines and
into the Atchafalaya River.
   Louisiana's first hydroelectric plant should be fully operational
by July 1, 1990, said Bill Fox of Ebasco, an engineering firm that
worked on the $500 million project.
   The Merrimac will creep upriver at 2 to 4 mph and should arrive
in northeast Louisiana over the weekend, he said.
   ``This is a major milestone,'' Fox said. ``It's been thought out
extremely well. Saving anything less than a hurricane, we ought to
be able to bring it in without any trouble.''
   The major obstacle is already anticipated _ the U.S. Highway 190
bridge at Baton Rouge. The bridge is too low for the tall structure,
so the plant must be partially submerged while it passes underneath.
   The Merrimac will probably be sunk 40 to 50 feet to leave a
clearance of at least five feet between the top of the plant and the
bottom of the bridge.
   The 10- to 20-hour process will be done by pumping water into
large hollow compartments that enable the structure to float. After
the plant clears the bridge, the water will be pumped out and the
Merrimac will resume its journey.
   Once in place near the Old River Control Structure, the Merrimac
will divert water from the Mississippi River through eight giant
turbines. The water will then flow through a two-mile-long channel
into the Atchafalaya River, a 17-foot drop.
   The plant is designed to generate 192 megawatts of electricity,
enough to light a city of 200,000 people.
   Owners of the power plant are the Merrimac Corp. of New York and
Dominion Capital Inc. of Virginia. The town of Vidalia shared
licensing for the project.

   Lebanon's two main Shiite Moslem factions
issued statements Tuesday endorsing President Ali Khamenei of Iran,
who was chosen as caretaker leader after the death of Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini.
   New shelling began after nightfall in the 3-month-old artillery
war between Christian army units and a a Moslem alliance of Syrian
troops and Druse militiamen. No casualties were reported.
   ``We declare obedience to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and swear
absolute commitment to his teachings and orders,'' said a statement
issued by the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God. Hezbollah is
the umbrella group for militant Shiites believed to be holding some
of the 18 foreigners missing in Lebanon.
   The rival Amal faction, a more moderate group backed by Syria,
said it ``supports and blesses the Islamic Republic in its correct
selection of the great successor Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.''
   Khamenei is only a middle-ranking cleric, but is being called
``ayatollah'' since his choice by the Assembly of Experts
established by Khomeini to handle the succession.
   Shiites mourned Khomeini for a third day with a general strike in
west Beirut and other Moslem areas of Lebanon. Khomeini, 86, died of
a heart attack Saturday, 11 days after intestinal surgery.
   Black flags and photo posters of the bearded, black-turbaned
revolutionary patriarch dangled from buildings and mosques in Moslem
west Beirut, the southern slums and Shiite towns in south Lebanon
and the Bekaa Valley.
   Mourners marched to the Iranian Embassy in the seaside Ouzai
suburb and Shiite religious centers in other cities to deliver
condolences.
   ``Death to America, the great Satan,'' read a banner carried by
about 200 mourners in the southern port of Tyre.
   A dozen youths in the Bir el-Abed slum beat their chests and
shaved their heads as worshippers entered the district's mosque for
a memorial service.
   The Lebanese Broadcasting Corp., run by rightist Christian
militias, broadcast Khomeini's funeral live. Cars equipped with
loudspeakers toured the streets in west Beirut and Tyre urging
businesses to close, and most complied.
   ``Close! Close!'' a bearded man shouted from a white Peugeot that
drove across west Beirut's Hamra commercial street flying the
Iranian flag and blaring verses of the Koran.
   ``Sure, sure,'' a grocer replied as he lowered his shutter.
   The car drove away and the grocer murmured: ``Last year it was a
strike to mark the Israeli invasion's anniversary. I wonder whether
we'll be alive next June 6 to observe a strike for any reason.''
   Israel withdrew most of its army from Lebanon in June 1985,
ending three years of invasion and occupation of the south. With the
aid of a surrogate militia, it maintains a ``security zone'' just
inside south Lebanon that ranges in depth from 6 to 10 miles.
   Palestinian guerrilla factions marked the anniversary by issuing
statements condemning Israel.
   Police said nine people were wounded in overnight artillery
exchanges, raising total casualties to 363 killed and 1,430 wounded
since the artillery duels began March 8.

<HEAD>Senators Told Elderly Being Ripped Off by Check-Handlers</HEAD>

   Elderly Americans are being ripped off by
representatives appointed to handle their Social Security checks, a
Senate panel was told Tuesday, but lawmakers and the Bush
administration disagreed on how to reform the system.
   An Arkansas woman and a California woman misused Social Security
payments that they had been entrusted to manage on behalf of elderly
beneficiaries, the Senate Special Committee on Aging was told at a
hearing.
   Elizabeth Freeland of Sacramento, Calif., testified that she was
told by the government that she needed a representative to handle
her disability benefits because she was incapable of managing the
money herself.
   But she said the woman who was appointed kept some of the
benefits for herself, and had a history of writing bad checks. She
did not identify the woman.
   A similar story was told by Mary Miller of Marvell, Ark., who
said her representative collected her disability benefits, then
refused to use the money to buy a telephone, clothes or other
necessities that Miller requested.
   ``She often would not tell me how much money she would have of
mine, or what was going on,'' Miller said.
   About 4.6 million Social Security beneficiaries have mental or
physical impairments serious enough that they require a ``payee'' to
manage their benefits.
   The Social Security Administration accepts applications from
anyone who wants to be a payee, but gives preference to relatives or
to public or private groups with good records in handling elderly
affairs.
   But Sens. David Pryor, D-Ark., and John Heinz, R-Pa., said the
government has been too lax in overseeing the program.
   ``There is some evidence that SSA has not been keeping a close
watch on those who apply to be representative payees,'' Heinz said.
``Presently, the SSA does not do background checks, nor does the SSA
monitor the program to ensure that the beneficiaries actually
receive their money.''
   Louis Enoff, an SSA deputy commissioner, said the administration
recognized there was a problem, and was evaluating steps to remedy
it. He said the victims represent a small percentage of often poor,
uneducated or handicapped people who are without relatives to care
for them.
   Enoff said SSA verifies the identities of payee applicants, and
asks them whether they have felony convictions.
   He said he was concerned about a bill introduced by Pryor and
Heinz on Tuesday that would require SSA to conduct criminal
background checks on applicants, while barring most creditors from
becoming payees.
   A ban on creditors would be too stringent and would keep, for
example, helpful landlords from becoming payees, Enoff said.
   Still other possible safeguards in the bill are not yet feasible,
he said.
   ``Ultimately, we plan to automate pertinent data on payee
applicants, including past misuse activity and felony convictions,
but the extent to which this can be done requires further
investigation, analysis and systems development,'' he said.

   Here is a look at key events in the student pro-democracy
movement, the government crackdown and the fighting between rival
army factions:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   April 15 _ Former Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang dies. Beijing
University students put up posters praising him and indirectly
criticizing opponents who forced his resignation after student
demonstrations in 1986-87.
   April 18 _ Thousands of students march in Beijing and Shanghai,
expressing dissatisfaction with the government and shouting ``Long
live Hu Yaobang! Long live democracy!'' About 1,000 stage a sit-in
at the Great Hall of the People to demand greater democracy, a free
press, and more money for education.
   April 24 _ Students begin boycott of university classes.
   April 27 _ In the largest to date of a continuing series of
protests, more than 150,000 students, with wide support from people
on the street, surge past police lines and fill Tiananmen Square,
chanting slogans for democracy and freedom.
   April 29 _ Officials meet with student leaders, but independent
student groups are not satisfied and continue a class boycott at 41
universities.
   May 4 _ About 100,000 students and supporters march on Tiananmen
Square to celebrate the 70th anniversary of China's first student
movement. Demonstrations are held in Shanghai, Nanjing and other
cities. About 300 journalists protest outside the official Xinhua
News Agency.
   May 13 _ About 2,000 students begin a hunger strike in Tiananmen
Square.
   May 14 _ Thousands flock to the square to back the students. The
number fasting rises to 3,000.
   May 15 _ The government deadline for students to leave the square
passes. Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's welcoming ceremony
planned near the square must be moved to the airport.
   May 16 _ Hundreds of thousands occupy the square. Journalists and
intellectuals join the protest.
   May 17 _ Zhao pleas for students to leave. Students reject his
appeal and hold marches that generate 1 million supporters in
Beijing.
   May 18 _ About 1 million people, including many workers, again
take to the streets to show their support for the hunger strikers.
Li Peng issues a stern lecture to student leaders and refuses to
discuss their demands.
   May 19 _ A tearful Zhao visits weakened hunger strikers. Li also
visits the students briefly. The students later decide to end the
hunger strike.
   May 20 _ Martial law is declared in parts of Beijing. Zhao
reportedly resigns after failing to persuade Li and other hardliners
to compromise. Students resume their hunger strike, then abandon it,
saying they will need their strength for the struggle ahead.
   May 21 _ Students claim to reject an order by Li Peng to leave
Tiananman Square or face military action. Defying martial law,
hundreds of thousands of people remain in the square or block
intersections to prevent troops from reaching it.
   May 22 _ Hundreds of thousands of people again block major roads
and senior military leaders say they are resisting orders to order
their troops on the protesters. At least one military convoy is
reported to withdraw.
   May 23 _ One million people take to the streets to demonstrate
for democracy.
   May 25 _ Li makes his first appearance since declaring martial
law. State-run radio says 27 of 29 provinces support martial law,
and military units announce they support martial law.
   May 26 _ Sources say Zhao and another leading liberal, Wan Li,
head of the legislature, are under house arrest.
   May 27 _ Beijing student leaders propose students end their
occupation of Tiananmen Square. Non-Beijing students resist and the
sit-in continues.
   May 28 _ About 80,000 people, many students from outside the
capital, stage a demonstration, but unlike in past rallies few
workers participate.
   May 30 _ Students unveil their ``Goddess of Democracy,'' a
replica of the Statue of Liberty, on the square. The government
calls it an insult to the nation. Students rally outside police
headquarters to protest the detention of three members of an
independent labor union.
   May 31 _ The first of several pro-government rallies is staged by
farmers and workers in Beijing suburbs. The participants, ordered to
show up, show little enthusiasm.
   June 1 _ The Beijing Municipal Government warns foreign
journalists that under martial law they must receive approval for
all press coverage. Coverage of the demonstrations is banned.
   June 2 _ More than 1,000 troops appear outside the railway
station in a show of force.
   June 3-4 _ Tens of thousands of troops make several attempts to
move on the square but are driven back by crowds of hundreds of
thousands of people supporting the students. Riot squads beat and
fire tear gas at demonstrators. A final push is made the evening of
June 3, and soldiers begin firing on crowds. Troops surround and
enter the square June 4 in the early morning hours and thousands of
protesters flee. Hundreds are killed and thousands wounded.
   June 5 _ Soldiers in Beijing randomly shoot at unarmed civilians.
Army reinforces positions in city center. Reports spread of a split
in the army and a battle between military factions. Demonstraters in
Shanghai, Nanjing and other major Chinese cities protest the
slaughter in Beijing. U.S. announces suspension of all military
sales and visits of Chinese military leaders, but stops short of
severing diplomatic ties.
   June 6 _ Armies loyal to rival factions trade fire. Soldiers
continue firing into crowds around Beijing. Anti-government
demonstrations spread to Shanghai, Nanjing, Chengdu, Shenyang and
other cities. Other nations urge their citizens to leave Beijing.

<HEAD>Fed Apparently Easing Credit Policies as Economy Slows</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After a year-long effort to fight inflation
with high interest rates, the Federal Reserve appears to be taking
its first steps toward easing credit policies, many economists said
Tuesday.
   These analysts said Fed policy-makers had apparently become
convinced the economy had slowed sufficiently to ease inflationary
pressures.
   The Bush administration, which at times has been openly critical
of the Fed's previous tight-money policies, reacted to the apparent
change by saying the administration had ``utmost confidence'' in the
central bank.
   Starting in March 1988, the Federal Reserve had pushed short-term
interest rates up by 3 percentage points in an effort to fight
inflationary pressures by raising the cost of consumer and business
borrowing and thus dampening demand.
   But in a sign of an apparent shift, a closely watched barometer
of Fed policy, the federal funds rate, declined on both Monday and
Tuesday.
   The federal funds rate is the interest that banks charge each
other to make overnight loans. The central bank influences the rate
through daily decisions on how much money it will make available to
the banking system.
   The federal funds rate, which had been averaging between 9.75
percent and 9.88 percent, fell to around 9.63 percent on Monday and
dropped further to around 9.56 percent on Tuesday.
   ``We feel the Federal Reserve is easing and I expect they will
allow the federal funds rate to drop even further,'' said Elliott
Platt, director of economic research at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette.
   He predicted a host of business and consumer loans would be
headed lower in the months ahead as the Fed loosens credit in an
effort to keep the economy out of a recession.
   On Monday, major banks announced they were cutting their prime
lending rate by one-half percentage point to 11 percent, the first
reduction in this benchmark lending rate in more than a year.
   Platt said he looked for the prime rate to fall to 9.5 percent
over the next three to six months, reflecting in part the Fed's
easier money policy.
   Michael Boskin, President Bush's chief economic adviser, refused
to comment specifically on whether the Fed had begun driving
interest rates lower, but he expressed confidence in the decisions
of Fed policy-makers.
   ``We in the administration have a great deal of confidence in the
Federal Reserve's ability to make sure that we don't let the
inflation genie out of the bottle on the one hand while making sure
that we do not overdo monetary tightening and throw the economy into
a recession,'' he said during an appearance before the National
Press Club.
   Earlier this year, Bush and Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady had
openly criticized the central bank for being overly concerned about
inflation while disregarding the threat that high interest rates
could topple the country into a recession.
   Boskin said Tuesday that it made sense for the central bank to
err on the side of fighting inflation in January and February when
inflationary pressures were higher.
   But he said current signals showed that the jumps in consumer
prices earlier in the year were related to temporary boosts in food
and energy costs and had not become embedded in the economy. He said
also there were many signs that economic growth was slowing to a
more sustainable pace.
   ``We have more balance now and we seem to be getting some
slowdown,'' Boskin said. ``I have utmost confidence in the Federal
Reserve.''
   Analysts said the May unemployment report released last Friday
probably provided the final bit of evidence the central bank needed
to decide that it could begin loosening its credit grip. The
unemployment rate fell to 5.2 percent, but it was accompanied by a
sluggish increase in the number of jobs the economy created.
   Former Fed governor Lyle Gramley, chief economist of the Mortgage
Bankers Association, said he believed the Fed would move cautiously
in lowering interest rates until it was more certain that inflation
was under control.
   ``I think the Fed will be cautious because we are not entirely
certain that our inflation problem is behind us,'' Gramley said.
   Gramley predicted that mortgage rates will drop further as
inflationary fears ease in financial markets. Fixed-rate mortgages
dropped to a national average of 10.48 percent last week, down from
close to 11 percent at the beginning of May.

<TEXT>
   President Bush on Tuesday marked the 45th
anniversary of the Normandy invasion and called for redoubled
efforts to help spread democracy around the globe.
   Bush, in a statement on the anniversary of D-Day, linked the
current stuggle in China and the Allied invasion that hastened the
liberation of Europe in 1945.
   ``The turmoil and confusion of battle that day belied the calm
purposefulness with which freedom confronts tyranny,'' the president
said.
   ``In recent days, the face of the world has again been marked by
dramatic occurrences _ winds of change _ that signify the
determination with which freedom confounds its adversaries,'' he
said.
   He recalled that on the morning of June 6, 1944, Gen. Dwight D.
Eisenhower ``carried in his pocket a draft message declaring the
invasion to have been a failure and taking personal responsibility
for that failure.''
   ``He never needed to use that draft, of course,'' he added.
   ``As with Gen. Eisenhower then, we cannot know with certainty
today whether the forces of freedom will prevail soon or in every
instance,'' Bush said. ``Yet the ultimate victory of freedom and
democracy is inevitable.''
   He said last week's successful NATO summit, as well as ``the
first free elections in Poland in more than 50 years and even the
momentous, tragic events in China give us reason to redouble our
efforts to continue the spread of freedom and democracy around the
globe.''

   The House of Representatives elevated Thomas S.
Foley of Washington to be the 49th speaker in its history Tuesday,
and he immediately appealed to both parties to ``put away
bitterness'' after months of turmoil that led to the forced
resignation of Speaker Jim Wright.
   Foley promised to help return tranquility to a House that has
been ripped by charges and counter-charges of ethical impropriety,
and to put ethics reform on his list of priorities for the year.
   ``I am a proud Democrat,'' Foley declared to the full House after
he was elected and sworn in. He appealed to Republicans as well as
his own party to ``come together and put away bitterness and
division and hostility.''
   ``We need to debate public issues vigorously, even passionately.
But we need to debate and decide with reason and without rancor,''
he said.
   Foley was elected on a party-line vote of 251 to 164, defeating
Republican Leader Robert H. Michel of Illinois. The vote, in a
crowded House chamber, marked the first time a party has changed
speakers in the middle of a congressional term because of a
controversy over ethics.
   Michel, in his concession speech, said, ``I'm all for putting an
end to bitterness. I'm all for putting our House in order. But we
don't do it by sweeping things under the rug.''
   In a final shot at Wright, Michel said members of the ethics
committee who had investigated him were ``neither mindless nor
cannibals'' _ a reference to Wright's call last week for the House
to end the ``mindless cannibalism'' he saw around him.
   Foley preached conciliation all day.
   In one session with reporters, he refused to rise to the bait as
he was asked repeatedly about GOP criticism of him by the Republican
National Committee, which is led by President Bush's former campaign
manager Lee Atwater.
   Foley said he would not get into ``debating matters with Mr.
Atwater. I want to put this House ... and the Congress squarely back
on a track of dealing with the issues that the country elected the
Congress to resolve with the president.''
   He commented after joining other congressional leaders at a White
House meeting on environmental legislation _ and after Bush
congratulated him on his new position.
   ``President Bush is the president of the United States, and every
way that I can work cooperatively with him, and my colleagues in the
Congress, I want to do so,'' Foley said.
   Wright, who turned the gavel over to his successor, praised him
before the House session as a man who could turn the chamber's
attention from backbiting to lawmaking.
   ``My great hope is that the House can return to its most
important business of legislating,'' Wright said, adding that
``vigilantism ... just begets more bad will.''
   Aides in Wright's office packed files and mementoes into boxes,
and workmen hauled them off. Wright spent the afternoon in his
office as Foley and other congressional leaders went to the White
House.
   At a news conference after he returned, Foley said he was asking
two bipartisan House task forces, one on ethics and the other on
campaign reform, to make their recommendations as soon as possible
so legislation could be considered ``in this Congress, this year.''
A ban on congressional speaking fees, linked with a federal pay
raise phased in over several years, could be a possibility, he said.
   Foley, the party's majority leader for the past 2{ years, had
been nominated unanimously by Democrats.
   Rep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif., who also is resigning from the House
because of ethics charges, called Foley ``a man for all seasons _ a
man uniquely suited for this season.''
   ``There is a steadfastness, an inner serenity to this man,'' said
Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y., who also made a nominating speech for
Foley in the caucus meeting.
   But Democrats were having a hard time forgetting the relentless
assault led by Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., that led to the fall of
Wright. Gingrich, now the House GOP whip, formally filed charges
against the Texas Democrat last year, triggering a year-long ethics
committee probe that cost more than $1.5 million and led to
allegations Wright violated House rules 69 times.
   Wright fought the charges for months, but announced last week
that he would resign not only the speakership but also his
congressional seat.
   Of the ethics commttee and Gingrich, who himself faces ethics
allegations over a book-promotion deal, Slaughter said: ``I want
them to treat him fairly, but I certainly want them to treat him.''
   Republicans on Tuesday circulated lapel buttons that said,
``Reform, not Revenge.''
   ``What you have is the schoolyard bully who's afraid of getting
punched back,'' said Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass.
   The Republican political machine, under the leadership of Atwater
at the Republican National Committee and Edward Rollins at the
National Republican Congressional Committee, has taken on a harder
partisan edge and has plans to exploit the ethics issue.
   One GOP political source, who spoke only on condition of
anonymity, said the campaign arm is sifting through Democrats'
financial disclosure forms looking for mistakes they can capitalize
on.
   The Democrats are expected to select a replacement for Foley as
majority leader next week. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, who ran
unsuccessfully last year for the Democratic presidential nomination,
is considered the favorite over Ed Jenkins of Georgia.
   The whip's race to replace Coelho is a contest among three
already powerful House Democrats: William H. Gray III of
Pennsylvania, the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus; David
Bonior of Michigan, the chief deputy whip, and Beryl Anthony of
Arkansas, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee. A fourth potential candidate, Henry Waxman of California,
said Tuesday he would not seek the post.

   The promotion of Democratic Rep. Thomas S.
Foley to speaker of the House leaves other leadership gaps his party
hopes to fill quickly.
   Foley, D-Wash., who had held the post of majority leader,
succeeded Jim Wright Tuesday, six days after Wright announced he
would step down because of charges that he violated House rules on
outside income.
   But the next in line for Foley's No. 2 post, Democratic Whip Tony
Coelho, D-Calif., also is resigning _ rather than face an ethics
inquiry like the one that ended Wright's career.
   So both the No. 2 and No. 3 Democratic slots in the House need
filling. With Democrats eager to put the ethics episode behind them
and limit any political damage, a party caucus has been scheduled
for next Wednesday on those races.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri is widely considered the
favorite to succeed Foley as majority leader. Gephardt, who ran
unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential nomination last year,
is considered a strong spokesman for the party without any potential
ethics issues in his background.
   Opposing him is Rep. Ed Jenkins of Georgia, one of the more
conservative Democrats. Jenkins, like Gephardt, is a popular member
of the Ways and Means Committee, and he enjoys the backing of that
panel's chairman, Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill.
   ``It's a good competition without acrimony,'' Gephardt said
Tuesday.
   The race for the title of majority whip narrowed to three
already-powerful Democrats on Tuesday when Rep. Henry Waxman,
D-Calif., announced that he would not be a candidate.
   Rep. William H. Gray III of Pennsylvania, currently chairman of
the House Democratic Caucus, is considered the front-runner.
   However, he's been battling published reports that the Justice
Department is conducting a preliminary investigation of his
personnel practices including an allegation about a no-show
employee. He has denied any wrongdoing and has questioned the timing
of leaks that occurred just as he was running for whip.
   Gray's remaining opponents in the race are Reps. David Bonior of
Michigan, the chief deputy whip, and Beryl Anthony of Arkansas, the
chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
   If Gray wins, his caucus chairmanship will be vacant. Two
lawmakers, Steny Hoyer of Maryland and Barbara Kennelly of
Connecticut, have announced they would like to succeed Gray.
   The death last week of Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla., also made
vacant the powerful post of chairman of the Rules Committee. A
Democratic caucus was scheduled for Wednesday to put Rep. Joe
Moakley of Massachusetts in that position.
   Coelho has announced he will leave the House on June 15, and
Wright also has said he will give up his Texas seat this month. With
Pepper's death, three House seats long held by Democrats will be up
for election.

   The Communist government, demoralized by
its crushing election defeat, again urged victorious Solidarity on
Tuesday to join a governing coalition _ a proposal the union has
turned down.
   ``It is time for a broad post-election coalition, a kind of pact
for economic reforms and democracy,'' government spokesman Zbyslaw
Rykowski told a news conference. A Communist Party spokesman said
Monday that Solidarity should show ``co-responsibility for the
country.''
   Politburo member Marian Orzechowski later told Polish radio,
``The voters' verdict shows all political forces, that is my
(Communist) Party, other coalition parties, groups and Solidarity
must undertake responsibility for Poland's future.''
   But Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said earlier: ``We did not
fight for chairs (in the Cabinet) for ourselves. We fought for a
different system of wielding power in this country.''
   In Sunday's election, the independent union movement won an
overwhelming majority in the new 100-member Senate and virtually all
of the 161 seats available to the opposition in the 460-seat Sejm,
the existing lower house.
   But the most bitter defeat dealt to the Communists was with the
``national list.'' That list had 35 top party and government leaders
running unopposed for the Sejm, but the candidates had to receive a
least 50 percent of the vote.
   It appeared that many ranking officials on the list, including
Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski, would not receive 50 percent
because millions of voters scratched their names from the list.
   The victorious union said earlier that the Communists and their
allies could have all of the 299 Sejm seats allotted to them under
the April agreement that legalized Solidarity again and provided for
the elections.
   Rykowski did not say what kind of coalition the Communists
envisioned and that question must wait until the new parliament
convenes after June 18.
   Orzechowski suggested various forms for such a coalition, ranging
from some kind of parliamentary cooperation to Solidarity
paritipation in the government.
   ``Results that we know are certainly bitter for my party and they
must make her think very deeply, make deep reflections, draw all
conclusions, no matter how deeply and how far they would go,''
Orzechowcki said.
   Solidarity has declared that it would not seek more power than it
was granted under the April accord.
   One seat in the Sejm and seven in the Senate may have to be
settled in runoff elections on June 18, said Anna Mizgajska, a
member of a Solidarity committee tabulating results.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said in
Washington: ``The U.S. regards Solidarity's apparent victory as a
victory for all Poles. Yesterday's concession by the Polish
Communist Party was statesmanlike and commendable.
   ``We welcome the reaffirmation of the party spokesman that the
Polish government will continue democratic and economic reforms. We
welcome Lech Walesa's call for hard work by all sides to find
solutions to the country's economic and political problems.''
   The Polish government spokesman said Rakowski will offer his
resignation and that of his Cabinet in keeping with tradition when
the new parliament is seated.
   But there was no indication whether Rakowski, named prime
minister in September, would actually step down or shuffle his
cabinet.
   The government said its poor showing was due to ``pent-up
emotions'' and complained about unreasonable propaganda against the
``national list.''
   Loss of the list could mean that such leading figures as
Rakowski, Interior Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak and eight members of
the 17-member Communist Party Politburo will not be seated in
parliament.
   Under law, the rejected officials can keep their regular
government posts, but it would be a blow to authorities' prestige
and the legitimacy of one-party rule.
   Many voters Sunday expressed pleasure at being able to cross off
leaders responsible for the Dec. 13, 1981, martial-law crackdown
that suppressed Solidarity, the Soviet bloc's first independent
trade union.
   Walesa said the union considered itself bound by the April 5
agreement in which it agreed to allow the government a full 65
percent of Sejm, or 299 seats.
   ``We have a lot of problems to solve in Poland. We have to
respect the round-table agreements. It's the platform from which we
started,'' he said ``Let's reject emotions and get on with solving
problems.''
   Authorities should be allowed to fill the vacant seats among the
299 in any manner they wish, Solidarity national spokesman Janusz
Onyszkiewicz and union adviser Bronislaw Geremek told a news
conference.
   ``We await what kind of proposals or solutions will be taken by
the other side,'' Geremek said. One such solution might be a new
election to fill the seats.
   There have been no details on what Polish leader Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski meant when he suggested a coalition in a speech Friday
night.
   Any such deal could open the path to a sharing of power
unprecedented in the Soviet bloc, where communist parties have
maintained a monopoly on power since the late 1940s.
   The next government will be formed by a prime minister named by
the president, a new post created as part of the accord between
Solidarity and the government.
   The post was widely expected to go Jaruzelski due to the majority
guaranteed the Communist Party and its allies in parliament.
   But after Solidarity's solid victory the opposition might propose
a counter-candidate.

   A prominent Soviet writer said during parliamentary
debate Tuesday on nationalist unrest that soldiers covered up ethnic
violence three years ago in Kazakhstan.
   The debate in the Congress of People's Deputies took place at a
time of more ethnic troubles, this time in the Central Asian
republic Uzbekistan. At least 50 people were reported killed over
the weekend.
   Writer Mukhtar Sakhanov said a letter from intellectuals in
Kazakhstan charged that soldiers used dogs and shovels to disperse
protesters and that the number of deaths has been kept secret.
   That protest was the first in a long series of ethnic
disturbances under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of
greater openness and social and economic reform.
   Sakhanov summarized the letter, then turned it over to Gorbachev
during Tuesday's session.
   It said the number of deaths in rioting in the republic's
capital, Alma Ata, was greater than the 32 killed last year during
violence last year between ethnic Armenians and Azerbaijanis.
   ``According to incomplete data, about 3,000 people were arrested,
hundreds of them were sentenced to long prison terms, thousands were
excluded from schools or fired from work,'' said the letter written
by seven Kazakh intellectuals. Copies were circulated in Moscow by
Kazakh activists.
   The violence in Sumgait, the Azerbaijani capital, was caused by a
dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave in Azerbaijan whose
population is predominantly Armenian. The territory was assigned to
Azerbaijan in 1923, but Armenia wants to annex it.
   On April 9, troops battled pro-independence demonstrators in
Tbilisi, the capital of the Georgian republic, and at least 20
demonstrators were killed. The use of shovels and a debilitating gas
by soldiers who broke up that protests has caused national outcry.
   The Baltic republics of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia also have
been beds of unrest as activists press for more autonomy.
   Official reports have said that only a couple of people were
killed in the Kazakh rioting, which broke out after the republic's
Communist Party chief Dinmukhamed Kunaev, an ethnic Kazakh, was
replaced by Russian Gennady Kolbin.
   The letter demanded a legislative commission be formed to
investigate the rioting.
   Also Tuesday, Russian writer Valentin Rasputin characterized the
dominant Russian population as a victim rather than master of the
vast Soviet bureaucracy.
   Ethnic minorities blame centralized control on domination by
Russians in Moscow, but Rasputin, of the Siberian city Irkutsk, said
the system had ``plundered Russia to such an extent that it is just
on this side of survival.''
   He complained that when Russians begin talking of their own
national culture and traditions, they immediately make other ethnic
groups wary.
   Members of the newly formed Soviet of Nationalities, the house of
the Supreme Soviet legislature that is assigned to deal with ethnic
questions, also met Tuesday and debated the ethnic unrest issue.
   It named the Communist Party chief of Uzbekistan, Rafik Nishanov,
as their chairman after questioning him about the violence in his
republic.
   Of 252 deputies present, five voted against Nishanov and 11
abstained.
   Gorbachev, presiding over the chamber, said the tone of some of
the debate ``leads to concern,'' but that he was satisfied with it.
   ``I'm very pleased because of the informal character of
discussion,'' he said. He said the house cannot duck hard questions.
``This is the people's life and we have to approach it seriously,''
Gorbachev said.
   The Soviet of Nationalities met after a morning session of the
2,250-member Congress.
   Lithuanian deputies demanded veto power over selection of the
chairman of the Soviet of Nationalities. When the house refused to
go along a deputy who did not identify himself raised the
possibility of Lithuanian secession.
   ``This is a constitutional right, and I do not want my native
Lithuania to be in such a bad union if it goes like this,'' he said.
   Deputy Vladimir Yarovoi complained to the Congress that Estonian
officials were discriminating against others. Reform in Estonia is
``a one-way street where there is no place for Russians,'' he said.

   Bush administration officials and lawmakers
clashed Tuesday over legislation calling for U.S.-Soviet
negotiations to ban the superpowers' production of plutonium, the
material used in nuclear weapons.
   Under questioning from members of the House Armed Services panel
on Department of Energy nuclear facilities, administration officials
also conceded that the United States has the ability to detect work
at Soviet reactors that manufacture plutonium.
   ``Don't we have the technical ability to pick up a large-scale
plant in the Soviet Union?'' said Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., one of the
House sponsors of the International Plutonium Control Act.
   After calling the question difficult to answer in an open
session, Troy E. Wade II, the Energy Department's acting assistant
secretary of energy for defense programs, said:
   ``We can determine if the facility is operating or not operating.
Period.''
   Wyden and Rep. Bill Green, R-N.Y., testified before the panel on
behalf of the legislation that seeks to compel the administration to
pursue the negotiations by threatening to block operation of some
U.S. nuclear weapons facilities.
   Identical bills introduced in the House and the Senate say that
six months after enactment, President Bush would be prohibited from
operating any of the facilities dedicated to production of plutonium
for military purposes unless he certified one of the following
conditions:
   _The Soviet government refuses to negotiate a ban on plutonium
and highly enriched uranium.
   _The United States is unable to determine whether the Soviets
have halted production, or
   _The Soviets continue to get plutonium by operating civilian
plants.
   U.S. facilities geared to plutonium operation are either
mothballed or closed permanently. In the Soviet Union, 14 reactors
produce enriched uranium and plutonium for the nuclear arsenal
although last month Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev announced
that he would shut down by the end of the year three of 14 reactors
that produce enriched uranium and plutonium for the Soviet nuclear
arsenal.
   ``The many congressional co-sponsors of the International
Plutonium Control Act have, in effect, asked the administration to
call Secretary Gorbachev's hand on the plutonium issue and negotiate
a mutual and verifiable end to production,'' Wyden said.
   Green said that when Secretary of State James A. Baker III met
with Gorbachev early last month, the Kremlin leader expressed a
desire to work on a bilateral agreement on controlling production of
all ``weapon-grade fissionable materials.''
   ``We should call his bluff,'' Green told the committee.
   But Kathleen C. Bailey, assistant director of the U.S. Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency, argued against the legislation,
saying the absence of U.S. facilities dedicated to plutonium
production versus the more than 10 Soviet reactors would force Bush
to negotiate from a position of weakness.
   In addition, ``this legislation would undermine U.S. capability
to make strategic nuclear materials in support of our nuclear
deterrent. Hampering our capability to produce nuclear weapons
before we cease to rely on them is dangerous and destabilizing.''
   Bailey noted that the Soviet nuclear program does not separate
military and civilian facilities while the United States does. If
the Soviets decided to ``break out'' of the ban, they could ``send
U.S. inspectors home, and turn their facilities and plutonium
stockpile to weapons purposes.''
   The administration argument prompted Rep. James Bilbray, D-Nev.,
to question whether the United States would have to ``build up its
capacity so we can break out.''
   Bailey responded the United States must negotiate from strength,
saying that was the case on the U.S.-Soviet treaty to eliminate
intermediate-range nuclear missiles.
   This exchange prompted questions from members as to the amount of
plutonium the United States has, with Rep. George Hochbrueckner,
D-N.Y., saying he believes that ``we are awash in plutonium.''
   But Wade, who declined to provide statistics, saying the
information is classified, said: ``I don't feel awash in plutonium
myself.''

   Only days after some units of the Chinese army
attacked thousands of unarmed demonstrators in Beijing, citizens
poured into the streets on Tuesday to give a hero's welcome to other
units.
   The astonishing contrast represents the sharp differences in
loyalties and backgrounds among the various factions of this
nation's fighting force.
   The 27th Army, based in Hebei province, is reviled and feared in
Beijing for shooting hundreds of people and smashing the student
demonstration in Tiananmen Square.
   But the 38th Army, which normally is responsible for defending
Beijing, is now considered a force that has come to drive the 27th
from the capital. Its troops were greeted Tuesday with loud applause
when they entered the city. People rushed forward to give them
cigarettes and shake their hands.
   The intentions of the 38th in entering Beijing remain unclear.
But Chinese and diplomatic sources widely agree the army group has
come to end the killing and possibly to drive the 27th from Beijing.
   Details are sketchy on the number of soldiers involved in the
three or four armies deployed in the Beijing area. The People's
Liberation Army is organized into about 22 Group Armies, such as the
27th or 38th. Each has about three divisions and totals about 40,000
soldiers.
   According to some information, less than half of each army has
been deployed in the city.
   The Group Armies of China are roughly equivalent to a Western
army corps, which normally has two or more divisions, plus auxiliary
troops.
   The London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies
estimates the Chinese military has more than 3 million men and women
on active duty, with about 2.3 million in the army. The 22 Group
Armies are spread among seven designated regions of the country.
   The army is overwhelmingly comprised of conscripts. Peasants are
drafted and almost always go to Group Armies in their region and
stay in that region.
   When Premier Li Peng on May 20 declared martial law, the orders
are believed to have gone to the 38th Army to suppress the
pro-democracy students.
   Astonishingly, it appears to have refused to obey orders, perhaps
because many of its recruits are Beijing students and its officers
have close personal and professional ties in the city.
   Its commander is said to have been arrested for insubordination.
   Instead, the 27th from Hebei province was given the task of
smashing the student unrest. Most of its soldiers are poorly
educated youths from rural areas who have been isolated from and
have little understanding of the democratic goals of the Beijing
students.
   More important, the commander of the 27th is widely believed to
have family connections to President Yang Shangkun, a former general
and a ranking member of the Central Military Commission.
   Yang, an ally of senior leader Deng Xiaoping, has led the
hardliners demanding a tough stand against the students, and was
instrumental in the reported ouster of Communist Party chief Zhao
Ziyang, who favored making concessions to the young activists.
   The 27th Army now appears to be on the defensive.
   Along with the 38th Army, the 28th Army is reported to be
entering the city. An army from Shenyang in northeastern China,
apparently the 64th Army also is said to be in the area and is
thought to have links with Zhao.
   There already have been skirmishes reported between soldiers of
the 28th and 38th with men of the 27th. The clashes are possibly a
prelude to a major battle to drive the 27th out of the capital and
end one of the worst crises in communist China's 40-year history.
   Less than half of each corps is thought to have been deployed in
Beijing. So far they have shown mainly tanks and armored personnel
carriers, but the groups are also equipped with anti-aircraft and
artillery regiments.
   Factional fighting has a long tradition in Chinese history, going
back to the warlords who constantly sought military advantages over
their neighbors.
   The Red Army which led the Communists to victory in 1949 gave
China a united fighting force, but Mao Tse-tung maintained
geographical military divisions of first 11 and now seven regions.
   Regional loyalties, and interregional rivalries, were a natural
outcome.
   The People's Liberation Army has always had a deeply political
role in Communist China, as epitomized by Mao's 1938 statement that
``political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.''
   During the first years of Mao's disastrous political upheaval,
the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, it was the regional armies that
stepped in to stop civil war between leftist factions and restore
order.
   The PLA's most disastrous attempt to interfere in politics came
in 1971, when Marshal Lin Biao, Mao's chosen successor, led a group
of military officers in planning a coup against Mao. The plot was
discovered, and Lin was killed in an airplane crash while trying to
escape to the Soviet Union.
   Military officers also played key roles in the arrests of the
leftist ``Gang of Four'' after Mao died in 1976.
   Under current leader Deng Xiaoping, however, the PLA has striven
to shed its political side, and concentrate on becoming a modern
fighting force. Deng reinstated ranks, trimmed the size of the PLA
by more than 1 million and reduced the role of political commissars
in making professional decisions.
   Still, it is the party's Central Military Commission headed by
Deng and Yang, and not the Defense Ministry, which has the final say
on military matters, and it was these old revolutionaries who
ordered the PLA to open fire on the people of Beijing.

   Wilbur the pig and Bilbo the hobbit
have a lot to teach grade-schoolers if only more educators and
parents would stop being afraid of fantasy literature, a professor
said Tuesday.
   Reading aloud in the classroom has grown more popular in the last
15 or 20 years, but such books as ``Charlotte's Web'' and ``The
Hobbit'' remain on the outskirts of structured curricula, Dr.
Roberta Herrin said.
   Herrin teaches fantasy literature at East Tennessee State
University and is helping coordinate a workshop next week for
teachers and librarians on the use of often-classic fantasy tales.
   The importance of self-esteem is explained through the
experiences of Wilbur in ``Charlotte's Web,'' Ms. Herrin said.
Charlotte, a spider, befriends the self-pitying pig and encourages
him to stand on his own four feet.
   Bilbo Baggins in ``The Hobbit'' finds his true identity after he
accepts a challenge from the wizard Gandalf.
   Students are more apt to learn the importance of such traits in
the framework of fantasy, Ms. Herrin said.
   ``You start with a narrative, a story, that engages their
interest and move from that to the very practical and concrete
applications,'' she said. ``That's very different than coming in and
saying, `Today we're going to study geography.'''

   After failing to sell his Potomac, Md.,
home for several months, former Sen. Birch Bayh, D-Ind., is taking a
different approach.
   The home was listed in a classified ad in Sunday's Washington
Post this way:
   ``Senator and Mrs. Bayh have slashed the price of their Potomac
home to way below market. They haven't been so beaten down since Dan
Quayle did it to 'em in 1980.''
   Quayle, now vice president, ended Bayh's Senate career during the
Reagan landslide of 1980.
   Bayh and his wife, Kitty, are selling their suburban home to move
back into Washington, he said.
   ``We decided we would try this to get people's attention.''

   THE LOYAL OPPOSITION: The three Republican members of the
Washington state congressional delegation have all expressed their
admiration for Foley any number of times, but when it came time to
vote for him they followed the party line and voted for Republican
Leader Bob Michel of Illinois. However, Reps. John Miller, Rod
Chandler and Sid Morrison joined with the Democratic members of the
delegation to escort Foley to the speaker's rostrum after the vote.

   A PUBLIC MOMENT FOR A PRIVATE LADY: Foley's wife, Heather, has
always avoided the public spotlight, but when Foley introduced her
during his speech the House gave her a standing ovation. Sitting
with her in the gallery were author Kitty Kelley, a longtime friend,
and Pamela Harriman, the grand dame of the Democratic Party.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   FOR THE RECORD: Foley voted present when his name was called
during the voting for speaker. The only other ``present'' vote was
cast by Michel.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   FINALLY A SMILE: Foley would have preferred becoming speaker
under different circumstances and as he left his office for the
Democratic caucus he said he felt ``more a sense of somber
responsibility than excitement.'' As he sat on floor while the roll
was called, he had a serious look on his face. He finally broke into
a smile when Jim Wright handed him the gavel after the election.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   APPLAUSE FROM BEHIND CLOSED DOORS: Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash., said
the loudest applause during the Democratic caucus came during
California Rep. Tony Coelho's seconding speech of Foley's
nomination. According to Dicks, Coelho said ``They (the Republicans)
are the party of Newt Gringrich. We are the party of Tom Foley.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   AUTHOR PLEASE: When Minority Leader Michel introduced Foley, he
took note of Foley's western roots. Michel said, ``Tom Foley coming
from the Great Pacific Northwest reminds me of the line of poetry
that says: `But Westward look, the land is bright.'''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   WHERE WERE THE WASHINGTON WINES? Foley hosted a reception in his
office for close friends and current and former staff after becoming
speaker. Though Washington state produces some good white wine, the
white wine was from France and California.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   DEPARTING FROM THE TEXT: On only rare ocassions does Foley speak
from a prepared text. His best speeches are usually from general
talking points or are extemporaneous. Foley spent time during the
morning working on his acceptance speech, but when he delivered it
he followed it only in part. ``He followed it only vaguely,'' said
one staffer.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   WHO IS THIS MAN? Foley was asked at his first formal news
conference to introduce himself to the American public. ``I'm 60
years of age, 6-foot-4 and reportedly weigh 240 pounds, though I
hope to make that less,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A DOG'S LIFE: Foley's dog Alice has attracted a lot of attention
over the past week, with some photographers more interested in
taking pictures of her than the speaker. But Foley has bad news
about her: ``Alice may not be with us much longer,'' he said.
``She's going on 17 years old, is totally deaf and it takes 12 hours
of sleep to get her going in the morning.''

   An armored force of Israeli soldiers and
allied militiamen left Israel's ``security zone'' in south Lebanon
on Tuesday to attack bases of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah militia in
the western Bekaa Valley.
   Police said two Israeli helicopter gunships supported a two-hour
assault on two Hezbollah bases.
   The attackers moved behind repeated strafing runs by Cobra
gunships into Berket Jaber village on the zone's northern edge, then
struck at Maydoun village six miles further north, the police
reported.
   In Jerusalem, the army said Israeli soldiers killed two
guerrillas and ``there were no wounded among our forces.'' It gave
the location as north of the zone near the village of Houne.
   Lebanese police said helicopter strafing runs started brush fires
that set some houses ablaze. A spokesman gave the casualties count
as one Hezbollah fighter wounded.
   Voice of the South, the radio station of the South Lebanon Army
militia, said the raiders seized arms, arms, ammunition and
explosives.
   Earlier Tuesday, an armored personnel carrier of the
Israeli-sponsored militia hit a land mine near Qantarah, two miles
northwest of the zone. The radio reported two militiamen wounded.
   Israel established the border zone, which varies in depth from
six to 10 miles, in 1985 after withdrawing from a three-year
invasion and occupation of south Lebanon. It keeps about 1,000
soldiers in the zone and the predominantly Christian militia has
2,500 men.

   Deputy Defense Minister Wlodzimierz Oliwa
has died, the official PAP news agency reported Tuesday. He was 64.
   Oliwa, the army's chief quartermaster and a member of Parliament
from 1976-85, died Monday, the agency said. It did not give the
cause of death.
   Oliwa, who had served in the army since 1945, held numerous
military and government posts.
   He was a member of the Military Council of National Salvation,
which administered martial law that was imposed Dec. 13, 1981, and
used to suppress the Solidarity union movement. Solidarity was
subsequently outlawed and martial law lifted.
   Solidarity was legalized again under an April 5 agreement between
the independent union and Communist authorities and scored major
victories in Sunday's elections.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II sought to make peace
with Scandinavia's dominant Lutheran Church on Tuesday and
challenged sexual and family mores in this liberal nation.
   During a Mass attended by 13,000 people, John Paul condemned
abortion and divorce as ravages of sin.
   It was the first time he raised the issues on his 10-day tour of
Scandinavia, where attitudes on sex clash sharply with Roman
Catholic teaching.
   Later, he attended a prayer service in the 12th Century Lutheran
cathedral in Roskilde, where he was not allowed to speak.
   Some of Denmark's Lutheran bishops had threatened a boycott if
the pope addressed the congregation at Roskilde.
   But a public opinion poll published Sunday suggests opposing
bishops were out of step with their congregations. The poll found 79
percent of Danes interviewed favored letting the pope speak at
Roskilde, traditional burial place of the royal family. Nine percent
were against and 12 percent had no opinion.
   The evensong service was a compromise. John Paul walked up the
aisle of the vaulted church, blessing a few people along the way,
and took a special seat to the left of the altar, where he followed
the service in a program.
   Afterward, he met with the Lutheran bishops and told them the
excommunication of Martin Luther should not be considered an
obstacle to collaboration and dialogue between Roman Catholics and
protestants.
   He acknowledged the years have not healed the ``deep wounds''
caused by the 16th century excommunication of the German priest who
sparked the Protestant Reformation, but said this cannot be done
``through a juridical (church) act.''
   Excommunication is the church's most severe penalty, which John
Paul explained is in force only during someone's lifetime.
   The pope praised Luther for his ``profound religiousness.''
   ``Primarily today we need a common reassessment of the many
questions raised by Luther and his message,'' he said. ``A
reassessment from the Catholic side has already begun.''
   Luther was excommunicated in 1521 for attacking widespread views
that salvation could be earned by good works, such as paying for
Masses, and indulgences to avert penalites in purgatory.
   Earlier, after his arrival from Helsinki, Finland, John Paul told
13,000 congregants at a Mass that sin in today's world takes the
form of ``a readiness to disregard human life or manipulate it
without reference to the inviolable dignity and rights possessed by
every human person from conception until natural death.''
   Sin, he said in English, ``wounds even the most fundamental of
loving relationships, that of marriage, by making us think that it
is too difficult, if not impossible, to be bound to one person
faithfully for life.''
   John Paul was speaking in a country where one abortion is
recorded for every three births, and half the marriages end in
divorce and abortions, prohibited by the Catholic Church, are free.
   The pope previously was in Norway, Iceland and Finland, and is to
visit Sweden before returning to Rome on Saturday.

   President Mengistu Haile Mariam said
Tuesday nearly 30 senior officers who tried to overthrow his Marxist
government three weeks ago were killed or committed suicide.
   Mengistu told his first news conference since the coup attempt
that two generals took their own lives in Addis Ababa on May 16, the
first day of the rebellion, and loyal soldiers killed 11 generals
and 15 senior officers three days later in Asmara, capital of
Eritrea province.
   He said 24 generals and 150 officers had been arrested and the
investigation was continuing. He said involvement of a foreign power
had ``not been established.''
   Maj. Gen. Haile Ghiorgis Habte Mariam, the defense minister, was
the only loyalist killed and two soldiers were wounded, Mengistu
said.
   ``There was not a single civilian casualty, and no property was
damaged in the capital or Asmara,'' he told the journalists.
   The rebellion began when the president left the country for a
visit to East Germany. Loyal soldiers quickly crushed the revolt in
Addis Ababa, but the 2nd Army held out in Eritrea for three days.
   Mengistu quickly returned home to face the most serious crisis of
his 12 years as head of the government established when he and a
group of other army officers overthrew Emperor Haile Selassie in
1974.

   Protest banners and tour cancellations Tuesday dramatized
American dismay at the crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in
China, as politicians and businesses weighed the costs of
disengaging from the world's most populous country.
   Anguished Chinese-Americans and others sympathizing with the
student protesters in Beijing continued to find ways to express
their anger at the bloodshed in Tiananmen Square on Sunday.
   Hundreds of Chinese and American protesters filled the steps of
the South Carolina Statehouse in Columbia holding banners that read,
``Trial for the butchers of Beijing'' and ``Our fallen heroes are
immortal.''
   University of California scholars in Irvine imposed an
educational boycott against the Chinese government, canceling trips
to Beijing.
   Maxwell Fry, an economics professor who was to have advised the
Chinese government on fighting inflation, said, ``I am not willing
to exchange views with them on the economy under the current
circumstances.''
   Twelve Indiana legislators and three businessmen canceled a trip
to promote trade and industrial cooperation between the state and
its sister province in China.
   Jackie Hughes, a native of Taiwan who owns a Gainesville, Ga.,
boutique, put a white ribbon outside her business and said she hopes
the practice catches on.
   The pro-democracy movement has used blue ribbons and headbands,
but Gainesville restaurant owner John Liang said white represents
peace in China and is the traditional Chinese color of mourning.
   Luming Zhao, one of 15 Chinese exchange students who have handed
out hundreds of black armbands at Central Washington University in
Ellensburg, said he had told a television reporter last week that
the military would not use force.
   ``I realize now I was naive. An army shooting at the people _ I
just can't believe it,'' said Zhao, 31, a graduate student from near
Shanghai.
   Another native of China said the violence unearthed buried
feelings.
   ``I thought I'd totally settled here and adopted it as my country
with China as my motherland,'' said Calvin Chien, 47, a senior
consultant in the Du Pont Co. engineering department in Wilmington,
Del. After the Beijing confrontation, he said, ``all of a sudden I
woke up. I have a much deeper tie to China.''
   With China facing the threat of civil war, the State Department
urged Americans in Beijing to leave.
   The only U.S. commercial airline serving the Chinese capital,
United Airlines, reported that its Monday flight took just five
people in, but had 307 flying out, to Tokyo. Figures for Tuesday's
flight will be available Wednesday, spokesman Joe Hopkins said in
Chicago.
   Hopkins said United had no plans to increase flights to the
Chinese capital, but had shortened turnaround times to ensure jets
arrive and depart during daylight.
   Northwest Airlines has changed its twice-weekly flight to
Shanghai to avoid leaving planes there overnight, and Thursday's
flight is fully booked, spokesman Bob Gibbons said. ``A much smaller
load is going into Shanghai than coming out,'' he said.
   Douglas Aircraft Co. chartered a plane to withdraw its 51 people
from Shanghai and two other cities. Of the hundreds of American
companies that have invested at least $3.5 billion in China since
relations were normalized, many withdrew employees from Beijing but
fewer left sites more remote from the violence.
   In Albany, New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, insisting he ``wouldn't
second guess'' President Bush's suspension of military sales to
China, expressed concern that the state's businesses might suffer.
   Cuomo, a Democrat, said he would ``call upon our congressional
delegation ... to be very vigilant about making sure that if there
are cutbacks, they not affect us inordinately.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush on Tuesday hailed the election
results in Poland as ``an important step toward freedom and
democracy.''
   ``The Polish people face a difficult task ahead, but their first
steps have been firmly in the right direction,'' Bush said in a
brief statement.
   Solidarity candidates won a decisive majority in the new
100-member Polish Senate and virtually all of the 161 seats
available to the opposition in the 460-seat legislative Sejm,
according to unofficial results of Sunday's balloting.
   Bush applauded the results and said, ``I am encouraged by the
responses of both the Polish government and members of the
opposition.''
   ``The Polish people are now taking steps that deserve our active
support. We will work in concert with our allies to help Polish
democracy take root anew and sustain itself,'' Bush said.
   The State Department also applauded the outcome, departing from
its normal policy of not taking sides in foreign elections by
calling the results ``victory for all Poles.''
   The United States normally expresses support for electoral
processes in foreign countries without taking sides among competing
parties.
   While praising the concession statement by Poland's Communist
Party, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Tuesday,
``The U.S. regards Solidarity's apparent victory as a victory for
all Poles.''
   A State Department official, insisting on anonymity, admitted the
official position prepared for the daily press briefing was not
properly phrased.
   ``We had no intention of taking sides,'' the official said. ``We
should have tightened up the language.''
   The official said he did not believe a retraction would be issued
since only one reporter had asked about the statement.
   Another official expressed no misgivings about the statement,
saying, ``We feel Solidarity better represents the people of Poland
than the other fellows (the communists).''

   Severe thunderstorms pelted northwest Oklahoma with hail Tuesday
and a tornado in Florida skipped through Clearwater, felling trees,
downing power lines and tearing shingles from rooftops.
   The thunderstorms moved eastward through western Texas Tuesday
afternoon.
   A flash flood watch was posted for extreme southern Oklahoma on
Tuesday night and into Wednesday for north-central and northeast
Texas, including the Dallas-Fort Worth area.
   Rain and thunderstorms were widespread across the south Atlantic
Coast and into portions of the central Gulf Coast.
   The tornado in Clearwater, on Florida's central Gulf coast,
snapped a palm tree in front of a school filled with youngsters and
ripped an awning from a minor-league baseball field, but no injuries
were reported.
   Nearly an inch of rain fell on Wilmington, N.C., in one hour
Tuesday morning. In the southern Appalachians, an inch and a quarter
fell within two hours in Bell County in southeast Kentucky.
   Rain also fell over parts of the middle and northern Atlantic
Coast, with nearly an inch at Portland, Maine.
   Scattered thunderstorms developed over the central Rockies and
central high Plains, producing small hail in the Colorado Springs,
Colo., area.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT included
nearly 2 inches at Tampa, Fla., an inch and a quarter at Wilmington,
N.C. and about an inch at Charleston, S.C., and Portland, Maine.
   Clear skies prevailed across the middle Mississippi Valley and
across the West.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 54
degrees at Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., to 99 degrees at
Beeville, Texas. The low in 48 contiguous states Tuesday morning was
29 degrees at Truckee, Calif.
   The forecast for Wednesday called for showers and thunderstorms
from the southern Plains to the Gulf Coast, the southern and middle
Atlantic Coast and southern New England, from Oklahoma and Arkansas
to western Missouri and along the Missouri Valley to North Dakota,
and from Minnesota to northern Michigan; and widely scattered rain
showers from eastern Montana to eastern Colorado.
   High temperatures were predicted in the 60s near the shores of
Lake Superior and along sections of the Pacific Coast, the 90s in
sections of Florida and from southern Texas and New Mexico to
interior valleys of California and southwest Oregon, over 100
degrees in the desert Southwest and along the Rio Grande Valley of
Texas, and 70s and 80s elsewhere.

   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley got a raise
Tuesday.
   Prior to taking the oath that made him speaker, the former
majority leader earned $99,500 a year. By moving up to the top post
in the House he boosted his earning to $115,000 annually.
   The Washington Democrat will not pick up many new perks, since he
already enjoyed the benefits of a House leadership seat.
   As majority leader, Foley was driven around in a government-owned
Lincoln Town Car. He will keep the car and driver.
   Foley already has extra staff members, and most of them will move
from the majority leader's office to the speaker's office.
   As speaker, Foley will become chairman of the 31-member
Democratic Steering and Policy Committee, which decides party policy
matters and makes committee assignments. He has been a member of the
committee.

   Tropical storm Dot struck the central

   There were no reports of damage or casualties from Samar, where
the storm went ashore, or the neighboring island of Leyte, also lay
in Dot's path. Such reports usually take days to reach the capital
because of poor communications.
   Chief weather forecaster Eduardo Parong said the storm hit land
at the southern tip of Samar, about 400 miles southeast of Manila,
and began moving west-northwest at 14 mph.
   A weather bulletin said Dot, the third tropical storm in the

province west of Manila across Manila Bay to northern Mindanao. The
coast guard said it prevented ships from leaving several ports.

   The Contras on Tuesday again defied U.S. pressure to
return to Nicaragua and vote in February's elections, saying they
will organize exiles and maintain their military strength.
   ``The State Department has urged us to return as quickly as
possible,'' said Aristides Sanchez, spokesman for the Contra
directorate's majority. ``But that is counterproductive ... it would
be premature.''
   Only one of the Nicaraguan rebels' seven directors, Alfredo
Cesar, has said he will go back to his homeland without conditions.
He is scheduled to arrive in Managua next week to begin preparations
for national elections.
   The directorate is based in Miami, which was chosen for its
proximity to the Central American country and its large Nicaraguan
community.
   Cesar's action ``shows different criteria, and those are not the
criteria of the majority _ we think it divides the opposition,''
Sanchez said.
   The rebels, who are receiving only non-lethal aid from the United
States, will also resist pressure to disband their troops
concentrated in Honduran camps just north of the Nicaraguan border,
the spokesman said.
   ``If the elections are a fraud, and if they do not produce a
constitutional, free, democratic country, the troops should be
viable to take up the struggle again,'' he said.
   The Contra rebel groups were supposed to be reintegrated into
civilian life under the Central American peace plan approved by the
region's presidents, but the Contra leadership has refused, accusing
the Sandinistas of violating their guarantees under the pact. The
Bush administration has threatened to renew military aid to the
Contras if the national elections are unfair.
   In an official statement announcing their electoral strategy, the
Contra directors pledged Tuesday to deliver a minimum 250,000
Nicaraguan exile votes to the opposition in February.
   Nicaragua's population of about 3 million includes 1.75 million
voters, according to the government. But exiles would have to return
to Nicaragua to vote under the law, which the opposition is trying
to change to allow voting in consulates.
   As many as half a million Nicaraguans have fled the war and
economic chaos in their country, with most settling in neighboring
Central American countries and the United States.
   The Contra statement said the Contra leaders will not return to
Nicaragua until they have successfully concluded talks with the
internal opposition aimed at unifying anti-Sandinista groups and
settling on a single presidential candidate.
   The Contras will insist on a ``national dialogue'' to set
conditions for February's vote, the statement said.
   ``With a unified opposition, the candidate should take the
initiative to call all Nicaraguans back to support them,'' Sanchez
said. ``Returning before that would be premature.''
   The Contras and the Internal Civic Opposition are meeting to
establish such a united front, Sanchez said.
   Asked how long the unification might take, he said ``we had hoped
it would already be done,'' refusing to give a deadline for the
talks to end.
   He said the Sandinistas have blocked the negotiations with a
series of ``impediments,'' such as denying visas to participants to
freely enter and leave Nicaragua.

   West German President Richard von Weizsaecker
met with President George Bush on Tuesday to wind up a six-day visit
to the United States celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Federal
Republic of Germany.
   Following up on the NATO summit meeting of last week, the two
presidents discussed Bush's conventional arms initiative and
developments in Eastern Europe, a U.S. official said.
   The official, who asked not to be identified, said the meeting
lasted about half an hour.
   Last Sunday von Weizsaecker was presented the American Jewish
Committee's highest award, the American Liberties Medallion, for his
contribution to understanding between Germans and American Jews.
   The West German president's post is largely ceremonial.

   Coal miners seeking support for two strikes
completed the first leg of a six-day march to the state capital
Tuesday, camping at the site of a battle between union and
government forces nearly 70 years ago.
   The miners on strike against the Pittston Coal Group expected to
join up with two other groups of marching miners, plus machinists on
strike against Eastern Airlines, for a multiunion rally Sunday at
the state Capitol in Charleston, with Jesse Jackson scheduled as a
speaker.
   ``We'll be singing all the way. We're not calling this off for
rain, sleet, snow or nothing,'' said Bethel Purkey, president of
United Mine Workers Local 5815.
   About 60 striking UMW members left their picket shacks near Logan
early Tuesday on the 85-mile march toward Charleston, he said.
   The Logan marchers at mid-afternoon reached Blair Mountain, the
site of a 1921 confrontation between federal troops and coal miners
struggling to organize West Virginia's mines.
   The miners lost that battle in a bloody era of the state's
history, but the confrontation marked a turning point in the UMW's
rise to power. The marchers planned to erect a plaque to commemorate
the battle.
   ``They passed this way to win what they got, so we're passing
this way to keep what we've got,'' said John Tomblin, 35, of Logan.
   In addition to Jackson, Sunday's rally is expected to draw
representatives of almost every other labor union in the state. UMW
President Richard Trumka is scheduled to attend, but Gov. Gaston
Caperton is undecided.
   ``We're going to Charleston to see what side of the fence the
governor's on,'' Tomblin said.
   The miners who set out Tuesday are part of a strike in West
Virginia and Virginia against the Pittston Coal Group. Pittston
workers walked out April 5 after working 14 months without a
contract.
   Another group of Pittston miners from the Logan area in southern
West Virginia planned to join the marchers Saturday.
   A third group of miners on strike against the New Beckley Mining
Corp. at the company's Glen Daniel mine also planned to join the
march Saturday. New Beckley miners have been off the jobs since
January.
   The battle of Blair Mountain was a result of a long history of
poor miners trying to organize and coal companies working maintain a
status quo.
   The UMW had been formed in 1890 but its attempts to organize
workers in southern West Virginia's Logan and Mingo counties met
with a coal company practice of firing anyone who joined the union
and evicting them from company-owned houses.
   The conflict led to the ``Matewan Massacre'' on May 19, 1920, in
which 10 people, including seven coal company detectives and
Matewan's mayor, were killed. The next year, Mingo County Sheriff
Sid Hatfield, a defender of the union, was shot and killed at the
McDowell County Courthouse where he was standing trial for murder in
connection with the Matewan shootout.
   Upon news of Hatfield's death, miners gathered at Marmet, outside
Charleston, for an invasion of Logan and Mingo counties and at Blair
Mountain met federal troops who had been called from Kentucky and
Virginia.
   Three union men were killed and 40 men from both sides were
wounded. The state brought 543 people to trial _ 22 on treason
charges _ but the treason charges were dropped and all others were
acquitted.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir Tuesday accused
the United States of encouraging cross-border Arab guerrilla attacks
on Israel by pursuing its dialogue with PLO officials in Tunis.
   Also Tuesday, Israeli troops fatally shot a 22-year-old
Palestinian and a 14-year-old Arab died of wounds received the day
before.
   Police fired tear gas in Jerusalem to scatter Arab crowds that
raised illegal Palestine Liberation Organization flags and shouted
slogans at a funeral for Omar Qassem, a PLO guerrilla leader who
died in prison.
   Shamir spoke while touring the border near the Misgav Am
collective farm, where guerrillas attempted to infiltrate from
Lebanon on Sunday.
   An Israeli soldier and three guerrillas died in the shootout, the
fourth in eight days on the frontier or in the Israeli-controlled
``security zone'' in southern Lebanon.
   ``We do not think the PLO has changed its path, its nature,''
Shamir told soldiers. ``The American contacts only strengthen their
motivation to continue in these acts.''
   Israel has opposed the U.S.-PLO talks since they began in
December after PLO leader Yasser Arafat recognized Israel's right to
exist and renounced terrorism. The next round of meetings is
scheduled to begin Thursday in Tunis, Tunisia.
   Jamil Hafez Suleiman, 22, was fatally shot in the head in a
stone-throwing clash with Israeli troops in Beit Lahiya, Arab
hospital officials said.
   Salem Salim al-Atuna, 14, of nearby Nusseirat refugee camp died
after being shot in the head in a confrontation with troops Monday,
the officials said.
   Throughout the occupied territories, army gunfire wounded eight
Palestinians.
   The army confirmed the two deaths and two wounded and said it was
investigating the other reports.
   The deaths raised to 508 the number of Palestinians killed in the
18-month uprising against Israel's occupation of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip. The unrest has killed 22 Israelis.
   Israel on Tuesday began issuing new identification cards that
Gazans will have to show to enter Israel. About 50,000 Gazans work
in Israel.
   Palestinians see it as a means of penalizing them for the
uprising, but Israeli officials say it is to increase security.
   About 2,000 Palestinians took part Tuesday in the three-hour
procession that carried Qassem's rough-hewn wooden coffin through
the streets of Arab east Jerusalem.
   Qassem, 48, died of kidney failure Sunday after serving more than
20 years in prison for leading a commando raid across the Jordan
River in 1968.
   He was a politburo member of the Damascus-based Democratic Front
for the Liberation of Palestine and was Israel's longest serving
Palestinian prisoner.
   It was one of the largest pro-PLO demonstrations held in the Arab
sector since the uprising began.
   Small children, many with faces masked with Arab scarves, waved
outlawed PLO flags. Other marchers shouted: ``With rifles we will
continue the struggle against Israel!''
   Helmeted riot police twice charged the marchers and fired tear
gas. Army radio said rubber bullets also were fired.
   No injuries were reported, but Israel radio said 20 protesters
were detained.
   Among the marchers were three Israeli-Arab legislators. One,
Abdel Wahab Daraushe, told mourners: ``In spite of Israel's
arrogance, the intefadeh will be victorious.'' Intefadeh is Arabic
for uprising.

   Rising country music star Ricky Van
Shelton, voted four awards by the public, said he knows now why
fellow singer Randy Travis has always been so happy.
   Travis has dominated country music awards for the past three
years, but Shelton was the bigger winner at the 23rd annual Music
City News Country Awards presentations Monday night.
   Shelton won male vocalist of the year, single of the year and
favorite music video, both for ``I'll Leave This World Loving You,''
and best album for ``Loving Proof.''
   ``I know why he (Travis) smiles so much now,'' Shelton said
backstage at the Grand Ole Opry House. ``It's wonderful.''
   Travis earned one award, entertainer of the year, the top honor
of the 16 presented. It marked the second straight year he won the
award.
   ``I've been lucky to win what I have,'' he said, reflecting on
his dozens of awards. ``I've always said I knew the time will come
when I won't win. I've got to be thankful for what I have and I've
had plenty.''
   Another country star who's received his share of awards, Johnny
Cash, won another Monday night and President Bush helped honor him.
   Cash was presented the Living Legend Award for a distinguished
career after a videotaped message from Bush was played.
   ``Your songs have helped reawaken patriotism in America,'' the
president said. ``In every sense of the word, you are a true living
legend.''
   Cash, who spoke by satellite from Hawaii where he was on vacation
following a European concert tour, said, ``It's a very humbling
experience to receive an award like this.''
   ``I'm as excited as Ricky Van Shelton must be,'' said Cash.
   For the fifth straight year, Reba McEntire was chosen No. 1
female vocalist. This year, the honor qualified as a wedding
present, coming just two days after she married Narvel Blackstock,
her manager, in Lake Tahoe, Nev. The marriage was announced Monday
afternoon.
   ``This award means to me one more time that I'm accepted,'' she
said backstage after accepting her plaque.
   The awards were presented during a two-hour syndicated television
special. Some stations will broadcast a delayed version of the show
later this week.
   All winners were picked by subscribers to The Music City News, a
monthly country music magazine published in Nashville.
   Patty Loveless, a cousin of country queen Loretta Lynn, was voted
Star of Tomorrow over the late Keith Whitley and three others. In
her acceptance remarks, she paid tribute to Whitley, who died of an
alcohol overdose May 9.
   ``Keith Whitley lives on with his music as far as I'm
concerned,'' she said.
   The Statler Brothers quartet was voted group of the year for the
sixth straight time, raising their total number of Music City News
awards through the years to a record 39.
   Other winners were: Ray Stevens, comedian of the year for the
fourth straight time; Ricky Skaggs, instrumentalist of the year; the
Judds, vocal duo of the year; the Whites, gospel group of the year;
The Nashville Network's ``Nashville Now,'' No. 1 TV series for the
fifth year; ``A Country Music Celebration: 30th Anniversary of the
Country Music Association,'' best TV special, and Dwight Yoakam and
Buck Owens, vocal collaboration (two or more performers).

   Nations urged their citizens Tuesday to leave
Beijing as troops continued random shooting on the streets, and some
countries chartered aircraft to speed the evacuation.
   In Washington, the U.S. State Department urged the 1,440
Americans in the capital to leave, and the 7,360 Americans who are
permanent residents elsewhere in China were advised to consider
leaving.
   The Bush administration said it was considering using chartered
aircraft to evacuate Americans, an administration official said on
condition of anonymity. But he said Americans did not appear to be
in immediate danger.
   Hundreds of anxious foreigners jammed airline offices and swamped
embassy switchboards with telephone calls for advice. Several
thousand filled the small international departure area of Beijing
Airport, many trying to buy tickets on stand-by.
   Michael Thompson of London, waiting with about 100 other British
students and teachers to board a special British Airways charter,
recalled it was less than two months ago that students at Beijing
Normal University, where he studied, first demanded democratic
reform.
   ``Who would have thought it would end like this?'' he said.
   Despite the turmoil, small numbers of foreigners continued to
arrive in Beijing on regular flights. About two dozen nurses from
around the world flew in from Hong Kong late Monday to attend a
nursing convention.
   ``We hope we won't be called into service,'' said one.
   Foreigners who have decided to remain behind rushed to stock up
on food supplies at the few stores still open in expectation of
prolonged violence.
   ``Do not go on balconies, look out the window or take photographs
of troops,'' the British Embassy warned in a handwritten sign tacked
on its door. ``They have warned they will shoot. They mean it.''
   The U.S. Embassy, which joined Tuesday in urging its nationals to
leave Beijing, hung small American flags from the doors of its
embassy vehicles and taped signs in the windows saying in Chinese,
``American Embassy,'' apparently hoping to discourage attack.
   Soldiers at some intersections have fired at any vehicles passing
through.
   A U.S. Embassy spokeswoman, who did not want her name used, said
staff members were telephoning all Americans who registered as
residents in Beijing to advise them to leave.
   Canada said it was reducing its embassy staff to a skeleton 15,
down from more than 40 Canadians, but other countries such as West
Germany and New Zealand said they were sending out only the
dependants of embassy staffers.
   Roland Hauser, a second secretary at the Austrian Embassy, said
employees of the embassy's trade section were leaving Tuesday via
commercial flights but that other embassy personnel planned to stay.
   Canada, Britain, Hong Kong and Japan arranged special chartered
flights for their nationals. West Germany said Lufthansa was trying
to send larger-capacity planes on its three-weekly flights to
Beijing.
   The walled compounds where most foreigners live in Beijing took
on an increasingly deserted look Tuesday.
   Few of the hundreds of Chinese who normally work in the compounds
as drivers, cooks, maids and translators showed up. The women who
normally run the elevators were absent, and several of the aged
machines promptly jammed between floors.
   The Australian Embassy invited its expatriate staff to move their
families onto the embassy's walled compound in a diplomatic quarter
of eastern Beijing, and several dozen staffers left their apartments
in a convoy Tuesday afternoon.
   Chinese witnesses reported small battles Monday and Tuesday
between army units backing rival political factions in the top
leadership, and fear of civil war prompted Tuesday's stepped-up
exodus.
   ``Earlier (our advice) was, `Keep your head down.' Now it's
basically, go,'' said a British diplomat.

   A California condor chick emerged from its shell
Tuesday, marking the fourth captive hatching in the most productive
breeding season for the critically endangered bird since 1984,
officials said.
   Named Shasta for the volcanic California mountain that was once a
range for North America's largest land bird, the chick was helped
out of its shell by keepers at San Diego Wild Animal Park, said park
spokesman Tom Hanscom.
   The egg was removed from its nest at the park's ``condorminium''
soon after it was produced April 9 by the parents of Molloko and
Mandan, the first and second California condors to be born and bred
in captivity.
   The bird's gender will be determined by a blood test, Hanscom
said.
   The hatching process began Saturday, when the chick pecked a hole
in its shell. During the final seven minutes, keepers cracked away
bits of shell until the 6.8-ounce chick was freed.
   ``This is the most productive year since 1984, when eight condor
eggs were taken from the wild and six successfully hatched,'' said
Hanscom. He said a seventh condor was born in the wild that year,
but five condor deaths in the wilderness reduced the net population
gain to two.
   Shasta's hatching raised the species' population to 32. It also
represented the first successful ``double-clutch'' in captivity,
Hanscom said.
   Condors naturally produce a single egg each year but often lay a
replacement egg if the first is lost early in the egg-laying season.
   All condors known to exist are in captivity _ 18 at the San Diego
Wild Animal Park and 14 at the Los Angeles Zoo. The goal of the
program is to rebuild the population to the point where condors can
be reintroduced into the wild.
   Hanscom said keepers hope to release an initial group of condors
in 1992.

   Rep. James Florio easily captured the
Democratic nomination for governor Tuesday, while four Republicans
were locked in a close battle for a chance to succeed outgoing Gov.
Thomas H. Kean.
   Florio, who barely lost to Kean eight years ago, trounced two
rivals in the Democratic primary. With 9 percent of precincts
reporting, Florio had 19,356 votes or 64 percent, Assemblyman Alan
Karcher had 5,680 votes or 19 percent and Princeton Mayor Barbara
Sigmund had 5,195 votes or 17 percent.
   In an eight-way GOP race, Rep. James Courter, who started the
race as the frontrunner, led with 9,045 votes or 24 percent. Close
on his heels were Attorney General Cary Edwards with 8,813 votes or
24 percent and state Sen. William Gormley with 8,736 votes or 24
percent. State Assembly Speaker Chuck Hardwick was fourth with 6,307
votes or 17 percent.
   Republican state Sen. Gerald Cardinale, who sounded a
conservative theme, was running a distant fifth and three other
Republicans who ran low-budget campaign _ Lois Rand, Thomas
Blomquist and James Kolyer _ trailed far behind.
   Kean, barred by law from seeking a third consecutive four-year
term, made no endorsement in what became one of the state's closest
GOP primaries in recent history.
   Florio, who lost to Kean in 1981 by 1,797 votes out of 2.3
million cast, deliberately kept a low profile on the campaign trail
and refused to engage in much debate with his more liberal opponents.
   In Sacramento, Calif., voters decided whether the Rancho Seco
nuclear power plant should become the first such facility in the
nation permanently closed by the electorate. The referendum on the
troubled 15-year-old plant was non-binding, but the commissioners
who operate it said they would abide by the results.
   Elsewhere, in Jackson, Miss., Democratic state Rep. Kane Ditto
was expected to best three token opponents in voting for mayor. And
in Florala, Ala., ousted Mayor H.T. Mathis tried to get his old job
back. Mathis, 86, who drew national attention last year when he
declared ``National Voodoo Week'' in the southern Alabama town, was
removed from office in August for abusing his pardoning power,
willful neglect of duty and incompetence.

<TEXT>
   All of New Jersey's major candidates agreed to accept public
financing and limit their campaign spending to $2.2 million. That,
plus Republican Kean's decision not to endorse any of the four
leading candidates also helped level the playing field.
   In New Jersey's GOP race, Courter stuck to his theme that he
alone was not from the state capital of Trenton, and did not
participate in creating the state's automobile insurance and budget
problems.
   Edwards emphasized his seven years of experience as a top adviser
and cabinet official in the Kean administration, saying he has
experience making hard decisions and writing budgets.
   Hardwick appealed largely to the conservative wing of the
Republican party and courted the pro-life and gun lobbies.
   Gormley spent most of his time and money in southern New Jersey,
aligning himself with Kean and going after moderate voters.
   During a grueling four months of campaigning, the GOP candidates
confronted each other at roughly 30 different forums, including five
hours of sometimes rancorous televised debates.

   The Senate voted 100-0 Tuesday to urge
President Bush to consult immediately with U.S. allies on imposing
international sanctions against the Chinese government ``to
demonstrate abhorrence'' over the killing of thousands of unarmed
students.
   The House earlier voted 406-0 to approve a resolution condemning
the violence used against pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing and
commending the president for acting to end military cooperation with
China.
   The Senate resolution also commends Bush and condemns ``the
brutal use of force by the government of the People's Republic of
China against unarmed advocates of democracy and human rights in
China.''
   But it also urges serious consideration of steps that go beyond
those taken so far by the president, including the consideration of
international sanctions.
   These include:
   _Calling on the U.S. Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private
Investment Corp. to review financing of trade with China ``in light
of existing legal requirements for adequate human rights treatment
and the deteriorating condition of human rights in China.''
   _Urging those U.S. agencies charged with liberalizing procedures
for export licenses for sales to China to ``take into account the
current situation in China in making their decisions.''
   _Urging the Voice of America to immediately increase
Chinese-language programming.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, and Minority
Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said the administration supported the
resolution.
   Mitchell said that while the United States cannot control events
in China, ``it is within our power to express the views of the
American people clearly, unequivocally and unambiguously ... in
total condemnation and denunciation of the actions that have been
taken.''
   ``We have witnessed a great leap backward in China,'' said Dole.
``I hope it is not too late for China's leaders to come to their
senses.''
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., said an increase in Voice of America
broadcasts can be accomplished quickly and ``do a service for the
people of China''
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said, ``This resolution is mild
compared to what the majority of us would like to see done to those
responsible for these atrocious acts.''

   As rival troops squared off in Beijing, The
Bush administration said Tuesday that China's senior leaders
appeared to have left the capital and urged the 1,440 Americans in
the city to get ut themselves.
   ``It's like the place is closed down,'' said White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. ``There's been no communication from the
leadership. There's no indication who the leadership is.''
   At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler called the
situation in Beijing ``tense and unsettled.''
   She acknowledged there may be dissension within the Chinese armed
forces and a U.S. intelligence source, commenting on the grounds of
anonymity said, ``What we're seeing, first, is a political struggle,
the outlines of which are very vague. Plus there is a serious
division'' within the Chinese Army leadership.
   Fitzwater said the U.S. Embassy has been in contact only with
mid-level Chinese officials but has had ``no contact with the
top-level people _ and we've tried.
   ``The assumption has been that the top-level people have moved
out to other locations. We tend to believe it.''
   Tutwiler, meanwhile, referring to the shooting of hundreds of
students demonstrating for democracy, told reporters:
   ``We have reason to believe that all elements of the Army do not
support what is taking place. We have no firm evidence of armed
clashes.''
   The Chinese capital was threatened with civil war as armies loyal
to rival political factions were reported battling in the city.
   The U.S. intelligence source said his information was that Army
units from Beijing had refused to move against the students in
Tiananmen Square even as Army elements from Nanjing carried out
Sunday's bloody attack.
   ``We're hearing all the reports of shooting between Army units,
but we have not confirmed that ourselves,'' the source added.
   An official, speaking on conditition of anonymity, said U.S.
intelligence reports reaching Washington estimated the death toll at
3,000, in line with estimates by diploatic sources in Beijing but 10
times the Chinese government estimate. This official said the
reports stressed the toll could go higher.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III decided to encourage
Americans to leave Beijing after a long telephone conversation
Monday night with James Lilley, the U.S. ambassador there. Baker was
told 50 percent to 75 percent of the employees of American firms had
already decided to leave.
   Ms. Tutwiler said arrangements were being discussed with United
Airlines and Northwest Airlines to supplement their regular service
from China with charter flights to carry out Americans.
   But United spokesman Joe Hopkins said in Chicago that his airline
had no plans to add flights.
   ``We're just operating our regular schedule'' of three flights a
week, he said.
   Indeed, one State Department official said that regularly
scheduled flights were proving adequate, so far, to handle the
number of Americans leaving the capital.
   ``We cannot order them to leave,'' the official said of the
Americans choosing to stay.
   In other developments:
   _A State Department official noted Chinese dissident Fang Lizhi
has been allowed to take refuge in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing.
   The official, who requested anonymity, said Fang, a 53-year-old
astrophysicist who had been denied permission to meet with President
Bush when he visited China in February, ``took refuge for his own
safety'' and has been at the embassy at least since Monday.
   _Bush directed the Justice Department not to move against Chinese
nationals whose visas have expired. Ms. Tutwiler said the visitors
could stay indefinitely.
   Subsequently, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh issued an order
allowing 73,000 Chinese students and 250,000 Chinese visitors and
business travelers to stay in the United States if they request
one-year extensions of their visas.
   _The National Academy of Sciences announced it was suspending a
cooperative exchange program with the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
   Frank Press, the president of the National Academy, said in a
telex to Chinese Academy of Sciences president Zhou Guangzhao that
the exchanges were being suspended ``in outrage and sadness'' and
that Americans ``are shocked and dismayed by the action of Chinese
government troops against peaceful demonstrators.''
   _The Senate and House voted without dissent for resolutions
condemning the violence in Beijing, with the Senate resolution
urging President Bush to consult U.S. allies on possible
international sanctions against China.
   On Monday, even after Army troops assaulted the pro-democracy
students in Tiananmen Square, the State Department encouraged
Americans in China simply to stay in touch with the U.S. Embassy or
the four U.S. consulates.
   ``I can't point to any specific thing that happened,'' Ms.
Tutwiler said about the newest State Department guidance. ``Every
day is different.''
   Elsewhere in China, the 7,360 Americans who are permament
residents were advised to consider leaving the country ``depending
on the local situation.'' Ms. Tutwiler said they should not leave
through Beijing.
   Additionally, the families of the 428 American diplomats and
workers at the U.S. Embassy and the consulates were given permission
to leave the country.
   ``There is no drawdown of embassy officers,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.
``The embassy and our four consulate offices continue to operate
fully.''
   Apart from permanent residents and U.S. officials, an estimated
4,000 Americans are traveling in China at ny particular time.
Tourists were advised not to go there.
   ``It is not an order to leave, but we are encouraging them to
leave,'' a U.S. official said in reference to the advice the embassy
was giving to the American residents of Beijing.
   Sources said telephone calls were being made systematically to
all American residents of the capital, who had been asked earlier to
make the embassy aware of their whereabouts.
   Ms. Tutwiler and the other officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said that no Americans were known to have been threatened
directly, but that the situation was too chaotic for them to safely
remain in China.
   On Monday, Bush suspended more than $600 million in U.S. arms
sales to China but stopped short of advocating economic sanctions,
at least for now.
   The decision to encourage Americans to leave, however, could
itself have a severe impact on American businesses operating in
China and on commercial ties to the country.

   The Senate sculpted the final contours of a
catchall bill Tuesday rushing $3.3 billion to veterans programs, a
shattered West Virginia telescope and a host of other projects and
making pronouncements on policies domestic and foreign.
   Lawmakers had hoped their third day of debate on the legislation
would be the last as they sorted through amendments to a ``dire
emergency'' measure President Bush first proposed in March.
   But they bogged down over an amendment offered by Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., to delay some of the new catastrophic care
provisions for the elderly under Medicare, including the surtax on
people more than 65 years old designed to pay for the program. Some
senior citizens have complained about the tax, which can reach a
maximum of $800 for the wealthiest of them.
   Democrats said catastrophic care changes should be made in
separate legislation, and work on the bill was scheduled to continue
Wednesday.
   The Senate rejected 69-29 an amendment by Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., allowing the Transportation Department to block aid to
communities refusing to give work on public transit projects to
companies that conduct business with the pro-apartheid regime of
South Africa.
   It also adopted by voice vote a provision by Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, calling on Congress to rework a tax
law business considers burdensome.
   That followed a 50-49 defeat for Sen. Robert Kasten, R-Wis., who
instead wanted the Senate to repeal the tax law, which forces
companies to prove their health benefits are as generous to low-paid
workers as they are to executives. For procedural reasons, Kasten
would have needed 60 votes to prevail.
   Kasten called the provision ``unwise, unworkable and just plain
unfair.'' Democrats agreed that the tax law needs revamping, but
said revoking it would be a mistake.
   ``Is there any reason we should be favoring management?'' asked
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas.
   The legislation is aimed at providing extra money for the rest of
fiscal 1989, which ends Sept. 30. It contains $1.2 billion for
veterans programs, $892 million for student loans, $342 million for
the costs of last summer's Western forest fires, and money for
efforts including foster care, refugees, the United Nations, and
food stamps.
   It also bestows federal money on a host of projects of a less
sweeping nature, but championed by various legislators for local
consumption.
   Thus, it contains $75 million to rebuild a 26-year-old West
Virginia radio telescope that collapsed last November, sought by
Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.
   Thanks to Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., $275,000 would
be set aside for Kansas State University to advise farmers on coping
with drought. Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, garnered $500,000 for
engineering work on a lake in Cincinnati that has filled with
sediment. Wyoming's two GOP senators, Malcolm Wallop and Alan
Simpson, got $400,000 for a study of last summer's fires at
Yellowstone National Park.
   In a boon to senators from 39 states, the measure also supplies
$6.6 million to continue subsidizing air carriers serving small
communities.
   The legislation also carries provisions stating the Senate's
views on an assortment of topics.
   The chamber wants the Agriculture Department to buy more apples
for the federal school lunch program to help the country's ailing
apple industry, thanks to Washington state's two senators, Democrat
Brock Adams and Republican Slade Gorton.
   It wants the Department of Health and Human Services to hire more
employees in Honolulu, in the home state of Appropriations Committee
member Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii.
   And it doesn't want Panamanian Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega to be
able to name a new administrator of the Panama Canal Commission,
which by treaty Panama's leader is entitled to do.
   One thing the bill does not have is $822 million for various
anti-drug programs contained in the $3.7 billion version of the
legislation the House passed last month. That discrepancy and others
will have to be worked out by negotiators before the bill can be
sent to the White House for Bush's signature.
   Bush, citing the federal deficit, has threatened to veto the
measure if it has any money for drug programs. The measure Bush
initially proposed was for $2.2 billion.

<HEAD>Court Bars State Water Flow Regulation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An appeals court ruled Tuesday that states
cannot regulate water flows from federally approved power dams,
rejecting arguments from 17 Western states that had sought the
authority in order to protect fish.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, a presidentially appointed agency, has
exclusive power under federal law to set standards for hydroelectric
projects, including water flows needed to protect fish.
   The ruling, which upheld a 1987 FERC decision, affects all types
of water power projects, including larger utility-owned dams, which
periodically must be relicensed. It is primarily important in the
West, where small hydroelectric projects have flourished since
Congress passed a law in 1978 requiring utility companies to buy
electricity from those projects when oil prices exceeded certain
levels.
   The states, led by California, were supported by several
environmental groups, which in written arguments to the court called
hydroelectric development ``one of the greatest threats to our
nation's free-flowing rivers.''
   ``The states tend to be the most knowledgeable, the most
sensitive to the resources at stake, and they have a major role to
play'' in protecting fish and wildlife, said John Echeverria,
general counsel of American Rivers, which led a half-dozen
environmental groups.
   The federal agency's position was supported by small dam
operators and major utility companies, who said state regulation
would disrupt hydroelectric development.
   One such project was the Rock Creek dam, a 3,000-kilowatt project
on a tributary of the South Fork of the American River about 40
miles east of Sacramento.
   FERC approved the dam in 1983 and required operators to maintain
a flow of 11 cubic feet per second of water into Rock Creek from May
to September, and 15 cubic feet per second from October through
April, to protect an important trout spawning ground.
   The California Water Resources Control Board, at the request of
state fish and game officials, set flow standards in 1986 of 30 and
60 cubic feet per second for the same two periods, saying the lesser
flows were inadequate to protect the fishery.
   Rock Creek officials objected to FERC, which ruled in 1987 that
it had sole authority to set the flow rates. The dam was completed
in 1986 and has operated under the federal standards.
   The other states supporting California's position were Alaska,
Arizona, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New
Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah,
Washington and Wyoming.

<HEAD>Pinochet Warns Against Human Rights Trials Of Military</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVA VERGARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Augusto Pinochet said the armed
forces will not tolerate human rights trials by special courts or
the Congress after a civilian government takes over next march.
   The lame-duck military president also said he will remain as army
commander after handing over power to a successor to be elected in
national balloting Dec. 14. He said his continuing on an army chief
was necessary ``to ensure Chile's institutional organization.''
   Pinochet's remarks came Monday at a meeting with Chilean women
journalists and were carried by local newspapers Tuesday.
   Under the constitution, Pinochet can stay on as army commander
for eight years after stepping down as president. The opposition
vehemently opposes that clause, but the 73-year-old Pinochet has
refused to change it.
   Asked about allegations of human rights violations under his
military government, Pinochet said he agrees ``some cases must be
dealt with by the courts.'' But he added, ``I cannot accept that
members of the services be targeted for revenge or that special
courts be organized in Congress.''
   He hinted that the future democracy could be threatened if that
happens.
   ``There would be a reaction against that'' from the military, he
said, ``and I don't want to even think what might happen.''
   Pinochet seized power in a bloody 1973 coup, overthrowing an
elected leftist government. Hundreds of leftists later were rounded
up. Many were tortured or killed and thousands forced into exile.
   The Roman Catholic Church and human rights groups here and abroad
have documented the cases of about 750 people who disappeared after
being arrested by security agents.
   Opposition leaders say they are not out for revenge but intend to
find the truth about human rights violations and bring those
responsible to trial.
   They insist their aim is to try individuals, not the armed
services as such.
   Pinochet emphasized that the armed forces have decided to return
to barracks and move away from the political arena after 16 years in
power.
   ``Now, I say so long, and It's your problem now,'' he said.
``It's over for me and for the army.''
   He said the military was leaving in disappointment, considering
the Chilean people as having been ``ungrateful'' to them.
   He referred to last October's national referendum in which voters
overwhelmingly rejected a military proposal extending his term until
1997. The outcome obliged Pinochet to call the December election.
   ``We received a country in chaos, and were are leaving a decent
country,'' Pinochet said.

<HEAD>Americans Returning from China Recount Tales of Horror</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans returning from China recounted tales of horror,
including one man who said he watched as troops opened fire into
crowds of students and was shocked because ``I've never seen people
mowed down, murdered.''
   Merv Lapin of Vail, Colo., returned from Beijing on Monday, two
days after Chinese troops moved in on pro-democracy demonstrators in
Tianmen Square, killing hundreds in the most violent suppression of
a popular movement in Communist China's 40-year history.
   The stockbroker and amateur hockey coach was on his seventh visit
to China, where he coaches children's hockey in Manchuria. He
stopped in Beijing on his way home.
   ``I saw one soldier go down on his knee _ maybe more than one,
things were moving so fast ... and he started firing into the
crowd,'' Lapin said. ``There was more than one soldier firing. My
guess is there were four, five, six-thousand soldiers.
   ``They started firing indiscriminately into the students. I saw
people falling ... It was chaos at this point.
   ``I was in a state of shock _ I've never seen people mowed down,
murdered,'' Lapin said. ``No one thought this was going to happen.
The students were just standing there with locked arms, some five or
10 deep. The feeling I got was that they were surprised. Everyone
started running and screaming.
   ``I saw bodies lying there _ it had to be in the hundreds _ and I
saw a tank roll over the bodies.''
   At San Franciso International Airport on Tuesday, Kathleen
Tiedeman, a delegate with the U.S. China Joint Seminar on Industry,
Trade and Economic Development, said she tried to get to Tiananmen
Square _ first in a taxi, then on the backs of bicycles pedaled by
students.
   ``We were about two miles from the square when the gunfire
started: there was no mistaking it,'' Tiedeman said. ``Then a wave
of panic took place. I tripped, and then two thoughts came: One, I'm
going to be shot, and two, I'm going to be trampled.
   ``My friend threw himself over me and said: `Stay down. Don't
move.' When we got up, we saw about 20 dead people all around us,''
she said.
   Passengers arriving at Los Angeles International Airport said
they were overjoyed to return to American soil.
   Carol Young said that from her hotel room she was able to see the
tanks approaching the center of the city.
   ``It was very frightening,'' she said. ``I could see the tanks
coming down the street. I could see the guns. I could see the guns
raise.''
   At New York City's Kennedy Airport, Helaine Harte, 23, of
Livingston, N.J., who was attending the Beijing College for
Economics, was among several Americans returning from China.
   ``I was really sorry to see what was going on there,'' she said.
``When the protests started and the demonstrations for democracy,
there was lots of joy and goodness but it all turned to disaster
this weekend.
   ``You see tanks in the street, places burning, you hear gunfire _
it's very, very frightening,'' she added. ``I had to leave but I'm
sorry that I did.''
   Ms. Harte said she had called the U.S. Embassy for help in
getting to the airport in China, but was told she would have to get
there on her own. She finally bribed a taxi driver with a sum she
said was more than he normally makes in a year.

   Foreign ministers of the Organization of
American States agreed Tuesday night to give a six-week extension to
a team of mediators assigned to achieve a democratic transfer of
power in Panama.
   The mediators are to report back to the foreign ministers before
July 19.
   Tuesday had been their deadline for a three-week effort to work
out a ``national accord'' in Panama that would lead to a ``transfer
of power in the shortest possible time.'' Their was no indication,
though, that the mediators had made much progress.
   Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto opposed the extension
on grounds that it did not have the explicit support of the
Panamanian government.
   Nonetheless, Panamanian Foreign Minister Jorge Ritter raised no
objection to the proposal, under which the foreign ministers of
Ecuador, Costa Rica and Trinidad will undertake a return mission to
Panama in a bid to carry out the OAS mandate.
   The agreement was reached in early evening after closed-door
talks at the Colombian Embassy where delegates spent much of the day
attempting to find common ground.
   After the extension was approved, D'Escoto delivered a lengthy
speech strongly criticizing the United States as an ``imperial
superpower'' which has systematically thwarted the
non-interventionist principles of the OAS.
   U.S. Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Lawrence
Eagleburger said the OAS must take account of charter provisions
calling for the establishment of representative democracy as a
guiding hemispheric principle.
   The OAS must show that the charter ``is not mere words,'' he said.
   Eagleburger assailed Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega and
said that the OAS must consider ``further action'' against Panama if
progress toward democracy is not achieved quickly.
   ``Noriega is the problem,'' he said.
   But Ritter maintained that a ``durable solution'' to Panama's
crisis was not possible as long as U.S. troops remain in the country
and the United States does not lift the sanctions it imposed against
Panama 15 months ago.
   ``There can be no normal political process under the current
circumstances in Panama,'' he told reporters after the four-hour OAS
meeting, elaborating on an earlier speech he made to the gathering.
   Much of the day was spent discussing the propriety of giving the
mediators a reporting deadline or making their mission open-ended.
   The mediators were said to oppose the imposition of a deadline
but the United States and other delegates argued that an open-ended
mission would ease pressure on Noriega.
   The U.S. delegation, led by Eagleburger, had lobbied during the
closed-door consultations for the mediators to report in 15 days but
settled on six weeks.
   In a report on their initial mission to Panama, the mediators
contended that an extension of their OAS mandate would be ``very
advisable.''
   There was no indication in the report that the mediators came
close to achieving the goals of a resolution approved by the OAS
mission on May 17. Much of the five-page report was devoted to
listing the names of Panamanians with whom the mediators met.
   The May 17 resolution criticized Noriega for the ``grave events
and abuses'' which occurred during and after the May 7 national
elections in Panama.
   Amid widespread allegations of fraud by forces loyal to Noriega,
the government threw out the election returns, creating the crisis
of legitimacy that the OAS has been attempting to resolve. There
also were brutal attacks on some opposition candidates by government
forces.
   One U.S. official said Sept. 1 is being viewed as a ``guidepost''
for the OAS mediators because Panama is scheduled, under its
constitution, to change presidents that day.
   Just who the new president would be is unclear because of the
scrapping of the May 7 election returns.
   Opposition candidate Guillemo Endara is widely believed by
international observers to have won the election. But Noriega's
hand-picked candidate, Carlos Duque, also claimed victory.
   Ricardo Arias Calderon, an opposition vice presidential candidate
who is in Washington for the OAS meeting, said Tuesday he believes
the OAS should approve a resolution that shows ``respect'' for what
he claimed was the 3-1 margin of victory by the opposition.
   ``We beat the dictator at his own game,'' Arias Calderon said.

   Paramount Communications Inc. late Tuesday
announced a $10.7 billion takeover offer for publishing and cable
giant Time Inc., which already plans a merger with Warner
Communications Inc.
   Paramount, an entertainment and communications company formerly
known as Gulf &amp; Western Inc., said it offered $175 a share for all
of Time's stock.
   The announcment came less than three weeks before Time and Warner
shareholders are scheduled to vote on the merger agreement announced
in March.
   The Time-Warner merger plan calls for a stock swap that the
companies valued at $18 billion and said would create the world's
largest media and entertainment company.
   Time said its board would review the proposal and advised its
shareholders not to do anything until they heard from the company.
   Warner officials had no immediate comment.
   Time, Warner and Paramount are all based in New York.
   Time shares closed at $126 Tuesday in consolidated New York Stock
Exchange trading, up $2.75.
   Paramount made its announcement after the market closed, and the
company noted it was offering a price 60 percent higher than Time's
share price just before the Time-Warner deal was announced.
   There had been speculation for weeks that a bidder could emerge
for Time despite its merger agreement with Warner. But Time
executives have privately insisted the company was not for sale.
   Harold Vogel, who follows the entertainment industry for Merrill
Lynch &amp; Co., called it a ``fascinating situation.''
   ``My feeling is that this is going to entail a much lengthier
battle than Time and Warner had anticipated,'' Vogel said. ``Both
companies were obviously in a rush to get this done as fast as
possible for concern that someone could come in and upset the
proposed merger.''
   Martin S. Davis, Paramount's chairman and chief executive, said
Time and Paramount ``are a superb business fit.''
   He said the acquisition of Time would represent ``the culmination
of a six-year strategic transformation of our company into a leader
in publishing and entertainment, a focus reflected by our new name.''
   ``Together we will be the foremost American communications
company, capable of competing on a global scale against foreign
media giants,'' he said.
   Paramount announced in April that it intended to sell its
consumer and commercial finance business, The Associates. It is
expected the sale could produce $3 billion or more in revenue.
   Paramount said Citibank has committed to provide $1 billion in
financing for the offer and has said it is highly confident of its
ability to arrange a syndicate of lenders to provide the rest.
   Davis said he told Time's chairman and chief executive, J.
Richard Munro, that Paramount was willing to negotiate all aspects
of its proposal.
   Paramount also said it would immediately withdraw its offer if
Time shareholders approve the Warner transcation.
   Both Warner and Time shareholders are scheduled to vote on the
proposed merger, a stock swap that the companies valued at $18
billion, on June 23.
   In a statement, Time said Davis advised Munro in a telelphone
call Tuesday evening that ``Paramount was launching a hostile offer
for Time's shares.''
   Time said the offer was ``in contradiction to explicit assurances
Mr. Davis had previously given Mr. Munro,'' but did not elaborate.
   Time has indicated that it has a $5 billion credit line available
to begin its own offer for Warner or defend itself against a
takeover.
   Paramount's entertainment interests include Paramount Pictures,
Paramount Television and Paramount Home Video. It owns Madison
Square Garden and two professional sports teams: the New York
Knickerbockers in basketball and the New York Rangers in hockey. It
also owns the MSG cable Network and a 50 percent interest in the USA
cable network.
   In publishing, Paramount owns Simon &amp; Schuster, Prentice Hall and
Pocket Books.
   Time is the largest U.S. magazine company, publishing such titles
as Time, People, Sports Illustrated amd Fortune. It owns the book
companies Scott, Foresman and Co.; Little Brown and Co.; Time-Life
Books Inc.; and Book-of-the-Month Club Inc.
   It also holds an 82 percent stake in the cable television systems
company American Television and Communications Corp. and owns the
cable programmer Home Box Office Inc., which includes the HBO and
Cinemax pay-TV services.

<TEXT>
   Would anyone but Leo Kottke be moved by the act
of walking across a parking lot with a 6-year-old child to suddenly
broach the subject of the birds and the bees?
   Pausing to lean on a car bumper, Kottke recalled, ``I said, Joe,
don't you ever wonder where you came from? How all these people got
here? Where I came from?'' The son wondered wearily, ``Dad, is this
going to be another one of your jokes?''
   It's often hard to tell whether Leo Kottke is about to produce,
after tortured rambling, some great truth _ or just another one of
his jokes.
   Kottke has an hour-long TV special, and it is a treat, both for
Kottke's amazing musicianship and for his gentle, intelligent wit
that seems to come from just across the kitchen table, not from up
on stage in front of a couple thousand strangers.
   ``Leo Kottke: Home &amp; Away'' premieres tonight on most PBS
stations.
   Perhaps there is something in the water out there in Minnesota
that produces performers who tell engaging but circuitous and often
surreal stories about just about anything.
   Garrison Keillor turned that ability into an art, as well as a
lucrative radio and book career. Kottke, who often appeared on
Keillor's radio show, ``A Prairie Home Companion,'' is more upbeat
than Keillor, kind of like an aging kid brother who veered off
temporarily into Zen Buddhism somewhere back down the line. He can
be funny and deep at the same time, as when he recounts how his
children, squabbling in the back seat of the car, were in fact
displaying a propensity for a mystically defined notion of art.
   Kottke's meandering stories are a nice juxtaposition to his
mind-bendingly intricate instrumentals. His unique style is a
fusion of country, jazz and folk influences. In the PBS show, he
also offers up vocal renditions of such classics as the Ed
Reeves-Alex Harvey love song ``Ring'' and Paul Siebel's haunting
``Louise.'' Chet Atkins and Doc Watson appear for a brief but
rousing bluegrass jam session.
   The special was produced and directed by Mary Perillo, who has
produced films for PBS' performance art series ``Alive From Off
Center.''
   Interspersed with elegantly spare concert scenes are video
vignettes of Kottke ranging around a guitar store in Nashville,
driving his car, shopping _ ``I keep lookin' for boots,'' he says,
examining a display of the cowboy variety, ``but they're all
pointy.'' _ and musing about the worth of motorboats, sitting in
his own leaf-covered example, up on blocks in his yard.
   The concert footage was filmed in Toronto. After the first
number, Kottke cheerfully explained to the rapt audience, ``It's
really necessary by this time in the set for me to speak,'' and
launched into a complex exposition on his tendency earlier in his
20-year stage career to become too involved in his own performance.
It seems he would drool on his guitar. He determined that this
chagrined the audience and reformed.
   Later, driving across a sun-bathed Minnesota landscape, Kottke
chats with the camera, recalling a philosopher's notion that the
creation of art has to begin with a lie. This recalls a back-seat
ruckus between his two young children. Sarah let out a scream and
informed her father that Joe had stuck his thumb in her eye. ``I
didn't know that was your face,'' Joe explained. ``My heart swelled
with pride,'' said Kottke, ``because I knew I had an artist in the
back seat.''
   Kottke takes the camera into his basement, where ``bad'' guitars
are left to think about what they have done. He displays an
ancient, oft-repaired old buzzard of an instrument that had been
smashed in a car wreck, restitched, stepped on, held together with
tape, reconstructed with a new 28-inch neck and then sawed off so
it would fit in a regulation-size case, leaving it with 10 strings
instead of 12. ``Despite all that,'' Kottke says gently, ``I'm
still stirred by this instrument.''
   And so is everybody else.

   Wrong is wrong. Drug abuse, for example. Racism,
for another. What's not as clear-cut is how far U.S. society should
go to redress such wrongs. Some say recent responses go too far,
jeopardizing the promises of the Constitution. Rights are rights,
they say. AP reporters Lee Mitgang and Sharon Cohen examine the
dilemma of societal wrongs and individual rights: a perceived
threat to free speech as colleges fight racism, and worries about
due process as police and politicians use evictions and other
measures to fight drugs.

   Stung by an outbreak of bigotry on U.S.
campuses, universities are taking steps to curb bias even if that
means curbing free speech.
   Civil rights advocates and civil libertarians, normally fast
allies, have become adversaries as schools try to limit the views
students can express and set penalties _ including expulsion in
certain cases _ if those views slur female, black or other minority
students.
   Such sanctions have stirred a bitter, highly complex debate
within higher education: Are anti-bias curbs likely to help, or
hurt? Are college campuses so different from the rest of society
that students' First Amendment rights can be abridged? Are colleges
abdicating their role as bastions of ideas, no matter how unpopular
or even hateful? Finally, are anti-discrimination rules
constitutional?
   ``I don't believe freedom of speech on campus was designed to
allow people to demean others on campus,'' said Robert W. Ethridge,
director of the equal opportunity program at Emory University in
Atlanta, which adopted anti-bias rules last fall.
   ``We just wanted to ensure that at a time when other
universities were having problems that we made it clear that we
wouldn't tolerate graffiti on walls or comments in classes.''
   Many agree.
   At Stanford University, where white students displayed a racist
caricature of Beethoven near black students' rooms last fall,
minority students have been pressing the school to enact sanctions
for the past year.
   The University of Wisconsin, where a white fraternity held a
mock slave auction last year, is considering anti-bias sanctions.
The University of Oklahoma is considering tightening existing ones.
   But last month a University of Michigan graduate student sued
his school with the help of the American Civil Liberties Union,
arguing that a recently enacted six-page anti-bias code is so broad
it violates the First Amendment.
   The student, identified only as John Doe in court papers, raised
a hypothetical question: Do Michigan's anti-bias rules bar a male
student from saying in class that men outperform women in a
particular field?
   Michigan's policy empowers the school to punish students guilty
of ``discriminatory conduct'' in classroom buildings, libraries and
university housing, but allows for more uninhibited speech in
student publications and open-air campus forums.
   It details behavior deemed discriminatory: any act that
``stigmatizes or victimizes an individual on the basis of race,
ethnicity, religion, sex, sexual orientation, creed, national
origin, ancestry, age, marital status, handicap or Vietnam-era
veteran status.''
   Even Michigan's law school dean, Lee Bollinger, won't bet on
who'll prevail in the lawsuit. ``The case law on what speech can be
restricted is quite unclear,'' he said.
   The constitutional debate centers on the so-called ``fighting
words'' doctrine. The U.S. Supreme Court coined the term in a 1942
ruling, Chaplinsky vs. New Hampshire, which stated that the First
Amendment did not protect ``insulting or `fighting' words _ those
which by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an
immediate breach of the peace.''
   The justices reiterated that view in Brandenburg vs. Ohio in
1969, and in Hess vs. Indiana in 1973.
   The University of Wisconsin filed a brief last March to the
state board of regents and cited the ``fighting words'' doctrine as
buttressing its proposed anti-bias rules.
   But in other decisions, the Supreme Court has protected
students' rights _ even the right to protest the draft with obscene
signs.
   In Tinker vs. Des Moines Public Schools in 1969, the court
upheld students' rights to wear black armbands to protest the
Vietnam War because the schools failed to show any evidence of
serious disruption to the educational process.
   But such apparently pro-free speech rulings may also have sown
the seeds for restrictions. By inference, the court indicated it
might sustain free-speech curbs on campus, said Bollinger, if
schools can show that certain speech leads to ``serious
disruption'' of education.
   A 1988 Supreme Court ruling involving a Hazelwood, Mo.,
principal who censored an article from his high school's newspaper
held that ``a school need not tolerate student speech that is
inconsistent with its basic educational mission even though the
government could not censor similar speech outside the school.''
   The Hazelwood ruling left unclear, however, whether that
principle applied equally to colleges.
   At worst, civil libertarians fear a future where free-speech
restrictions could turn America's campuses into ``re-education
camps'' where only right-thinking people feel free to speak out.
   ``Does this mean you eventually ban a Louis Farrakhan, or a Meir
Kahane, because they might upset some students?'' asked Sheldon E.
Steinbach, vice president and general counsel of the American
Council on Education, the chief Washington lobby for higher
education.
   ``Where are campuses going if they cannot discuss issues openly,
even in a provocative manner? If you erect these kinds of potential
punishments, aren't you creating a chilling effect on free speech
on campus? If I say the number of Jews killed during the Holocaust
was overstated, am I baiting? Will I be judged post facto to have
said something that is offensive?'' Steinbach said.
   But the slights and insults minority students say are
commonplace at all-too-many campuses convinced at least one civil
liberties advocate that anti-bias restrictions are needed.
   John Schwartz, a Dallas lawyer whose usual stock-in-trade is
defending newspapers in First Amendment suits, wound up drafting
The University of Michigan's anti-bias rules last spring.
   Schwartz said in an interview that his bedrock allegiance to
absolute First Amendment rights was shaken after spending hours
hearing black students at the Ann Arbor campus. They described,
among other things, how they felt after racist jokes were broadcast
over a university radio station last year.
   ``I think what tipped it for me was that I had been looking at
the problem wrong,'' he said. ``I always thought that students
ought to be able to shrug these (racial) comments off. But minority
students are incredibly isolated on a mostly white campus. I was
floored by the fact that minority students deal with this on a
regular basis.''
   To Bollinger and others, the essence of the debate gets down to
what ideals universities ought to represent:
   ``Should the university be the place in society where there is
ultimate protection of free speech, or is it a place where you want
to preserve civility and discourse? Those are two very different
models, both with strong appeals,'' Bollinger said.
   On at least some campuses, free speech and civility have become
a very difficult mix.

   Charlene Goodman lives by the law and tries to teach her two
children to do the same. But when her 17-year-old son was charged
with selling cocaine, it almost cost her family something very
precious: their home.
   For three months, the Wilmington, Del., housing authority fought
to evict the Goodmans from their $311-a-month apartment, saying the
drug dealing _ which occurred miles away near other agency property
_ violated terms of their lease.
   Ultimately, Ms. Goodman won her court battle. The 32-year-old
seamstress, who testified she wasn't aware of her son's actions and
tried her best to control him, was bewildered.
   ``I felt like I was being prosecuted for something someone else
did,'' she said, recalling her worry about being evicted. ``I
didn't break any law.''
   Her case typifies the growing efforts by law enforcement and
political leaders to wage war on drugs with tactics _ evictions,
raids, even criminal charges against pregnant women _ that have
stirred new debate and sparked numerous lawsuits.
   _ In Washington, D.C., and Alexandria, Va., people suspected of
drug involvement have been evicted without being convicted. A new
Maryland program asks landlords to include in leases a clause
stating that anyone selling drugs will be evicted.
   _ In several states, prosecutors seek to convict women for using
drugs during pregnancy. Minnesota lawmakers recently passed a
measure to permit doctors who suspect a pregnant woman is abusing
drugs to test her without her knowledge; drug users are not
punished but urged to seek treatment.
   _ In Chicago, public housing raids have been conducted without
warrants or tenants' consent. A suit also claims personal
belongings were searched. A city alderman wants a law that would
authorize the arrest of loiterers in areas where drugs are sold.
   Civil libertarians say these are grandstanding acts that
victimize the innocent, discriminate against the poor and reek of
McCarthyism. Beyond that, they say, they're ineffective.
   ``The war on drugs is really a war on the American people, whose
rights are being invaded,'' said professor Steven Wisotsky of Nova
Law Center in Florida. ``There's a mass invasion of civil liberties
on the grounds it's necessary to win the war.''
   ``Attempts to legislate away social problems are usually very
unsuccessful,'' said James Fyfe, an American University
criminologist and former policeman.
   But frustrated prosecutors and politicians, pressured to act and
act fast, say aggressive isn't necessarily invasive. There are
enough legal checks and balances to protect the innocent, they say.
   ``I don't see where anybody has the civil rights to use drugs,''
said prosecutor Paul Logli of Winnebago County, Ill. A grand jury
recently refused to indict a woman he charged with involuntary
manslaughter after claiming her cocaine use led to her baby's death.
   ``If people are going to do drugs, sell drugs or buy drugs, they
have to be discouraged in any way possible,'' Logli added. ``People
who introduce this cancer or support this cancer have to pay a
price. If it's losing housing, it's an appropriate response.''
   In one week last month in Washington, marshals evicted 257
people from residences where suspected drug activity occurred.
   Some of the most intense efforts have been in drug-infested
public housing. Housing and Urban Development officials have issued
waivers to public housing agencies in Boston, Washington, New York
and Alexandria, Va., allowing them to streamline the eviction
process by up to nine months.
   HUD Secretary Jack Kemp has vowed to ensure due process, but
some worry that people will be harmed, especially parents unable to
control drug-dealing children.
   ``If it happened to a middle-class person in their own house,
they would not lose their abode,'' said American Civil Liberties
Union attorney Loren Siegel. ``It's picking on the most vulnerable
people in society and creating a whole new group of homeless.''
   Sometimes, she said, people not even suspected of wrongdoing are
hurt. The ACLU is representing a woman and her children in
Peekskill, N.Y., ordered out when their building was seized as a
suspected drug den.
   But those directing the raids insist there is local support.
   ``The people want it,'' said Vincent Lane, the Chicago Housing
Authority's chairman. ``I have received requests for sweeps from
every development in the city.''
   And Alexandria, Va., Mayor James Moran agrees: ``The strongest
pressure I'm getting to clamp down harder is coming from the
residents of public housing. If it were up to them, they'd have
public executions in the courtyard.''
   Alexandria has evicted 18 families from public and private
housing after two controlled drug buys from each residence, Moran
said.
   ``We don't want to take any risk of evicting an innocent
person,'' he said. ``We don't want to ruin it for the rest of the
country.''
   Moran said the city is compiling a public file of Social
Security numbers of people evicted in drug cases, and landlords can
then deny them housing.
   Still, the impact is limited, he and others concede.
   ``It nowhere near begins to really address the major problems of
drugs,'' said Richard Nelson, director of the National Association
of Housing and Redevelopment Officials. ``That requires a lot more
than pure enforcement pressure.''
   A similar criticism was made of the District of Columbia's plans
for a juvenile curfew aimed at curbing drug-related violence. It
was rejected in May by U.S. District Judge Charles Richey, who
called it a ``bull in a china shop of constitutional values.''
   Other crackdown efforts, such as prosecuting pregnant drug
abusers, Have been denounced as senseless and damaging to those
needing help.
   ``They're creating out of thin air a new crime _ the mother's
failure to provide the perfect womb,'' said Lynn Paltrow, of the
ACLU's Reproductive Freedom Project.
   ``The biggest effect of all this attention is to have a pregnant
woman currently using any type of drug to shy away from going to a
hospital and delivering,'' said Rockford, Ill., attorney Alberto
Altamore, who represented a woman convicted of pre-natal child
abuse for using cocaine up to a few hours before birth.
   But prosecutor Logli responds: ``It may be something that drives
them underground or it may be the last straw that convinces them to
do something about their own problem.''
   Similar cases are emerging elsewhere. In Florida, a woman who
allegedly took cocaine during pregnancy is charged with child abuse
and distributing drugs.
   In a different type of get-tough program, criminal court judges
in two Tennessee counties have begun asking people convicted of
possessing or selling drugs to name their supplier. Refusal could
earn a contempt charge. The progam is modeled after one in
Columbus, Neb.
   This aggressive approach follows other controversial measures,
including widespread drug testing in industry and government, and
forefeiture laws in many places allowing property, such as cars and
boats, to be seized from people accused but not convicted of drug
offenses.
   A survey of more than 1,000 corporate members of the American
Management Association found that in 1988, 48 percent of companies
tested for drugs, compared with 21 percent in 1986.
   While all of these steps have come under attack, even critics
understand the motive.
   Constituents clamor for politicians ``to solve the drug
problem,'' said Arthur Spitzer, ACLU legal director in Washington.
   But he cautions against quick fixes. ``It's a problem that's
been a long time in coming,'' he said, ``and it will be a long time
in going away.''

<HEAD>With the House At Stake, Computers and Lawyers Are Ready for Redistricting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Armed with batteries of computers and brigades
of lawyers, Republicans and Democrats are skirmishing for control
of the political shakeup that offers the GOP its once-in-a-decade
opportunity to dent Democratic control of Congress.
   ``If we want to be competitive in the House, we have to get a
good shake on redistricting,'' said Charles Black, the political
consultant who is chairman of the Republican National Committee's
advisory committee on redistricting.
   ``Right now, given the strength of incumbency, there are only
two times you get a chance to pick up any congressional seats,'' he
said. ``One is when the seats are open, and two is when you redraw
the lines.''
   For Republicans, redistricting is a chance to break out of their
depressing status as a seemingly permanent minority in the U.S.
House.
   Democrats control the House by a margin of 260 to 175. While
voters in recent presidential elections have preferred Republican
candidates by landslide margins, Democrats now hold 18 more House
seats than they did when Ronald Reagan was inaugurated in 1981.
   Democrats claim the capital's political split personality comes
from voters' desire to have Congress act as a balance to GOP
presidents. Republicans claim the split is rooted the Democrats'
drawing the lines for most current congressional districts.
   Redistricting is the once-a-decade reshuffling of the nation's
congressional districts. It is a three-pronged battle _ technical,
political, and legal.
   Every 10 years, the U.S. Census counts everyone living in the
country. This time, the day for the count is April 1, 1990.
   For politicians, the most important Census information is not
how many Americans there are, but where they live. For while the
population increases, the size of the U.S. House remains at 435
voting members.
   By Dec. 31, 1990, the Census Bureau will announce each state's
population. And the bureau will reveal the reapportionment of the
U.S. House _ the number of representatives for each state, based on
a complicated mathematical formula.
   Then comes redistricting at the state level _ redrawing the
boundaries of congressional districts to fit the new population.
   Gone are the days when cigar-chomping politicians matched up
Census data with voting lists and redrew lines to help their
friends and punish their enemies.
   They're still helping their friends and punishing their enemies,
but now the politicians do it with computers that produce highly
sophisticated plans to can do in a legislator with subtle shifts of
city blocks.
   But computers have little value to politicians who don't have
the votes to get their plan adopted.
   The two parties are considered on a par technologically, but the
Democrats control 28 state legislatures, while Republicans have
only 8. In 13 states Republicans control one legislative chamber
and Democrats the other. Nebraska has a unicameral nonpartisan
legislature.
   The other key players are governors _ 28 are Democrats, while 22
are Republicans.
   Elections this year and next will determine who controls
redistricting. In the states expected to gain or lose the most
seats, neither party is in control, promising fierce battles for
governor and legislative seats.
   The 1990 Census will certify the shift to the Sunbelt that will
have Congress speaking with a decidedly more Southern and Western
accent. Based on current estimates, 17 House seats will head South
and West.
   California will be the big winner, gaining six seats with an
outside chance of picking up seven. With 45 members in the current
House, California already has by far the largest congressional
delegation.
   Other winners are Florida, expected to gain four House seats,
and Texas, likely to pick up three. Likely to gain one each are
Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia.
   The losers are a familiar lineup _ mostly Northern industrial
states that have seen their congressional representation erode in
recent decades.
   If current trends hold, New York will lose three seats and
Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio and Illinois two each. Losing one each
would be Kansas, Iowa, Kentucky, Massachusetts, West Virginia and
Wisconsin.
   With redistricting clout in the balance, the high-profile races
for governor are in California, Texas, Florida and Illinois _ all
of which are now in GOP hands. But George Deukmejian of California
and Bill Clements of Texas are not running for re-election and Bob
Martinez of Florida is regarded as vulnerable. Jim Thompson of
Illinois hasn't announced yet whether he will seek a fifth term as
governor.
   In addition, the battle for control will be fought in countless
legislative contests.
   For example, in Michigan, Democrats would control the process if
they capture the state senate where Republicans have a narrow
majority. In Pennsylvania, Republicans control one chamber by four
seats and Democrats the other by three.
   After the politicians draw the district lines, the battle will
move to another arena, the courts.
   At some point in the 1980 process, redistricting plans in all
but three states ended up in court, says Kimball Brace, president
of Election Data Services, a consulting firm that works on
redistricting for Democrats.
   Thus Republicans and Democrats are recruiting teams of lawyers
to defend their plans or attack the opposition's in federal and
state courts.
   The guiding legal principle stems from the Supreme Court's ``one
man, one vote'' ruling that mandated that legislative districts be
substantially equal in population.
   Brace cited a Michigan plan that ended up in court. Republicans
offered a plan with congressional districts differing in population
by no more than four people. But the court ruled in favor of the
Democrats' plan which was drawn with each district identical in
population.
   How long do districts remain identical in population? Probably
not more than a day or two after the Census is taken.

   People are born, people die, people move.
   Those 18 Michigan districts started out with a population of
514,560 each in 1980. As of July 1, 1986, according to the Census
Bureau, the population of the 13th Congressional District in
Detroit had declined to 444,600. The Fifth District, which includes
Grand Rapids, had grown to 552,000.
   Population isn't the only criteria. In states with a history of
racial bias, redistricting plans must be cleared by the Justice
Department to assure they don't discriminate against minorities.
   Whatever the process, cries of ``gerrymander'' are certain to be
heard across the land from politicians who didn't have the votes to
get their own redistricting plan approved.
   The term comes from Massachusets Gov. Elbridge Gerry, who is
better remembered for the redistricting bill he signed in 1811 than
for the fact that he also signed the Declaration of Independence.
The redistricting bill, designed to help Democrats and weaken
Federalists, created a salamander-shaped district that was
immediately dubbed a ``gerrymander.''
   But the general rule is: better to be accused of gerrymandering
than to be gerrymandered.
   Republicans cried gerrymander frequently in the early 1980s,
pointing often at the most notorious recent example of the genre _
the California plan attributed to the late Rep. Phil Burton. It
redrew congressional lines in a manner that Republicans claimed
cost them five seats.
   At the time, the governor of California was a Democrat and the
party controlled both chambers of the legislature. The Republicans
were nothing more than injured bystanders who appealed
unsuccessfully to the courts for redress.
   While Republicans cry foul about Democratic redistricting,
Democrat Ann Lewis says the first partisan shot came from the GOP.
   ``The Republicans of Indiana began the redistricting year
gloriously by using their political strength to eliminate one
Democratic congressman and endanger others,'' said Lewis, then
political director of the Democratic National Committee. ``And the
Republican Party spent the rest of the year complaining that
Democratic majorities were trying to act in a partisan fashion.''
   Republicans entered 1981 with high hopes. Reagan had just taken
office and dreams of a historic political realignment were dancing
in GOP heads. The 1980 Census had found a major shift of population
from traditionally Democratic industrial states to the more
conservative Sunbelt.
   Banks of computers were set up at the Republican National
Committee as party leaders predicted technology would provide a
substantial advantage.
   But in state after state, the Democratic politicians outwitted
the GOP's computers.
   ``They had three computers, $4 million and a staff of 40,'' said
Lewis. ``I had two typewriters, one and a half staff people and no
budget allocation at all....
   ``But I had more friends than they did. I had more legislators
than they did and ultimately we were able to produce more votes
than they did.''
   Rich Bond, a Republican consultant and former RNC political
director, still gnashes his teeth when reminded of the 1981
redistricting.
   ``The Republican National Committee thought it had a technical
edge and talked about it a lot and it flopped,'' he said.
   Redistricting can be an unsettling experience for politicians
who normally are among the nation's most secure elected officials.
Most congressmen, while on the ballot every two years, have what
amount to ten-year terms. For example, 99 percent of the House
members who sought another term in 1988 were re-elected.
   Listen to Tom Hofeller, redistricting expert for the House
Republican campaign committee:
   ``You're not really a veteran in redistricting until you've sat
down at a strategy session during the middle of the process and
said, `We know we're safe here. They can't possibly screw us here.'
And had the Mack truck come and run right over you.''

   When California voters elect a new governor in
1990, they will shape the make-up of the U.S. House for the rest of
this century as well as the course of the 1992 presidential race.
   It's no wonder that Republican Party chairman Lee Atwater has
declared that his ``main objective for 1990 is electing Sen. Pete
Wilson governor of California.''
   ``We're prepared to fight them tooth and toenail,'' said
Democratic Rep. Tony Coelho of California.
   Rarely has a single state election had the potential national
impact of the contest to succeed Republican George Deukmejian, who
opted against seeking a third term as governor.
   The numbers tell part of the story.
   Already the nation's most populous state, California now has 45
seats in the House and is expected to gain six or seven more after
the 1990 Census confirms the continuing shift of the nation's
population to the Sunbelt.
   That means California will have 53 or 54 of the 270 electoral
votes needed to elect a president in 1992. In addition, it is
likely that the state will assert its influence on presidential
nominating politics by moving its presidential primary to early
March.
   The initial advantage in the high-stakes governor's race went to
the Republicans when they convinced Wilson to run for governor,
taking on another multi-million-dollar race just after he won a
second Senate term in 1988.
   On the Democratic side, party leaders would like _ without much
realistic hope _ to avoid a bitter gubernatorial primary between
state Attorney General John Van de Kamp and former San Francisco
Mayor Dianne Feinstein.
   California is a major source of campaign contributions for
politicians from all regions of the country, but even its political
largess could be strained in 1992 if Wilson is elected governor.
   If that happens, Wilson's appointed successor in the Senate
would have to run in 1992 for the final two years of the term. And
the seat now held by Democrat Sen. Alan Cranston is up in 1992 as
well.
   California fund-raisers shudder at the prospect of two Senate
races during a presidential year in which the state also will have
six new House seats.
   The big losers could be the large group of Democratic senators
elected in 1986, when the party regained control of the Senate.
Many of those Democrats would like to raise thousands of dollars in
California.
   ``It's certainly going to make us much more introspective,''
said Steve Moses, a major Democratic fund-raiser in Southern
California. ``We're all going to be focusing on ourselves. We will
not be as available to others.''
   On the other hand, Bob Burkett, an entertainment industry
executive who also is an active Democratic Party fund raiser, said
the burst of activity would probably have little impact on
Californians who regularly give $25,000 a year to political
candidates.
   ``I keep answering this question, yes,'' said Republican
businessman Jack Flanagan when asked if money could grow tighter
for GOP candidates. ``Yet we keep finding new donors.''
   While the impact of the governors race on fund-raising is
debatable, there's no question of the redistricting stakes.
   In 1981, when new district lines were drawn to conform to the
1980 Census, California gained two new U.S. House seats.
   The Democrats controlled the legislature and the governor was
Edmund G. Brown Jr., also a Democrat.
   The Republicans were on the sidelines as the Democrats rammed
through a plan _ authored largely by the late Rep. Phil Burton _
that was credited with enabling his party to win five seats in the
1982 elections.
   With California picking up six or seven seats this time, the
stakes will be even higher.
   The Democrats still control the legislature, but unless they can
upset Wilson, they'll have to reach a compromise with the governor.
   ``If we win the governor's race _ and I think it's very
doable,'' said Coelho, ``then we have the legislature and the
governor and we go ahead and have a very smooth reapportionment
from our point of view.''
   The congressman predicted that a Republican governor would balk
at any compromise with the legislature. Then the issue would be
decided by the courts, where many of the judges were appointed by
Ronald Reagan.
   ``They would do basically a Republican plan,'' Coelho said of
the courts.
   Should the GOP come out way ahead in California and also pick up
seats in states like Texas and Florida _ which also have Republican
governors _ Coelho said it would ``have an impact on national
legislation.''
   ``Say we lose ten Democrats. You could have an impact on every
bill we got through in the 87-88 year because we barely got a lot
of them through,'' said Coelho who was the chief Democratic
vote-counter in the last Congress.

<HEAD>Bishop Tutu Heads Anti-Apartheid Slate In Contested Harvard Election</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archbishop Desmond Tutu was among five
anti-apartheid candidates for Harvard University's governing board
awaiting word on whether alumni supported their stand against the
school's investments in South Africa.
   ``It has been a vituperative campaign. Things have heated up,''
said Robert Wolff, director of Harvard-Radcliffe Alumnae Against
Apartheid.
   The group, which has three members on the 30-member Board of
Overseers, ran five candidates against a Harvard Alumni
Association-backed slate of 10, including U.S. Transportation
Secretary Elizabeth Dole, former Democratic Party Chairman Paul
Kirk and actor John Lithgow.
   Results of the election, which was open to all Harvard degree
holders and conducted by mail, will be made public Thursday at
Harvard's commencement.
   The anti-apartheid group has pressured the university to
withdraw its $162.8 million in investments in companies doing
business in South Africa.
   Tutu, a black leader of the Anglican church in southern Africa
and a 1984 Nobel Peace Prize-winner, has threatened to return the
honorary degree Harvard gave him in 1979 unless the university
backs away from its South Africa-related holdings.
   Wolff, a professor of philosophy at the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst, charged that Harvard had campaigned
against the anti-apartheid slate.
   Fred Glimp, vice president of alumni affairs, denied that but
said voters should be wary of one-issue candidates.

   The West German government on Tuesday

save African elephants from extinction.
   The ban invoked by the federal Environment Ministry took effect
immediately, a ministry statement said.
   It said the the number of African elephants had dropped to about
700,000 in the last 10 years.
   ``We have to conclude that African elephants are threatened with
extinction,'' the ministry stated.
   France imposed a similar ban over the weekend and the West
German ministry said it expected other European Economic Community
countries to follow suit shortly.

   Initial buyout offers for NWA Inc. have been
rejected and suitors for the parent of Northwest Airlines have been
given until June 16 to enhance their proposals.
   ``None of the proposals is sufficiently more attractive than the
others,'' a five-member review committee set up by NWA's board of
directors said Monday in a letter to bidders.
   The letter said each of the bids is ``subject to unacceptable
material conditions.'' It directed interested buyers to address
regulatory concerns and asked for revised bids to propose
compensation for NWA in the event it accepts an offer that later
collapses.
   ``Bidders should specifically address their ability to
consummate a transaction in light of financing and other
conditions,'' the letter said.
   The committee's letter also repeated a statement that ``there
can be no assurance that a sale of NWA or any other transaction
will result from NWA's review of alternatives.''
   NWA stock tumbled $1.87{ to close at $106.87{ a share in
consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading Monday.
   Pan Am Corp., which earlier made a proposal valued at $3.3
billion, was the only announced bidder to say immediately it would
submit a revised bid, but the company did not reveal details.
   Other known bidders are billionaire Marvin Davis, whose $2.7
billion offer earlier this year started the bidding process; Alfred
Checchi, a Los Angeles investor who heads a group that includes KLM
Royal Dutch Airlines and the Australian holding company Elders IXL
Ltd.; and Northwest's 20,000-member Machinists' union.
   KLM spokesman Peter Wellhuner said today that the Dutch state
airliner was not surprised by the move and is studying its options.
He said there is a ``good possibility'' the Checchi group will
``get in touch again with Northwest.''
   Checchi would not comment on the rejection. A spokesman for
Davis said the oil mogul would study the committee's letter ``and
for now will withhold any reaction to it.'' Guy Cook, president of
the International Association of Machinists District Lodge 143, did
not return telephone calls seeking comment.
   Barbara Beyer, president of Avmark Inc., an aviation consulting
firm in Arlington, Va., said NWA's move could be designed to
broaden the scope of bidders for the nation's fourth-largest
airline. Suitors who were told the bidding would be conducted in a
single round could by angered by such a development, she said.
   Among those rumored as a possible suitor is the New York
takeover firm Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., which could now step
in and make a bid if it missed the initial deadline, Beyer said.
   A KKR spokesman has declined to say whether the company is a
bidder. The company continued its silence Monday.
   U.S. Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner has informed NWA
his department would review any proposed leveraged buyout of the
airline to judge the financial fitness of the proposed new owner.
   NWA's review committee will meet with department officials to
discuss Skinner's concerns, the company said Monday.
   The committee said in its letter that suitors are welcome to
meet with NWA management to seek more information about the
airline, based in the Minneapolis suburb of Eagan, but the letter
stressed that the meetings would not include negotiations.
   ``You should be aware that no aspect of any of the proposals has
been disclosed to members of NWA management,'' the letter said.
   The quote prompted rumors that NWA management, led by Chairman
Steven Rothmeier, was assembling its own buyout proposal, said Kurt
Rivard, an analyst for Dain Bosworth Inc. of Minneapolis. But
Rivard said he doubted such a move was in the works.
   Rothmeier told reporters in April that no management-led buyout
offers were planned.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities fell in the latest auction to the lowest level this year.
   The Treasury Department sold $6.4 billion in three-month bills
Monday at an average discount rate of 8.17 percent, down from 8.50
percent last week.
   Another $6.4 billion was sold in six-month bills at an average
discount rate of 7.99 percent, down from 8.36 percent last week.
   The rates were the lowest since three-month bills sold for 8.14
percent on Dec. 19 and six-month bills averaged 7.87 percent on
Nov. 14.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 8.46 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,793.50 and 8.44 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,596.10.

   Both Congress and the White House are
expressing outrage at the violence in China, but U.S.-China farm
trade appears to be continuing as usual.
   ``I don't believe in using food as a weapon,'' Sen. Patrick
Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, said
Monday. ``With all that the Chinese people are suffering, we should
not deprive them of food as well.
   ``However, the Chinese government must not use our food as a
weapon against its own people. I know the world community would
object to any attempt of the Chinese government to restrict the
flow of food to its people.''
   The Agriculture Department announced Monday that China has
bought another 1.8 million metric tons of soft red winter wheat
from U.S. farmers, according to exporters. That makes 2.65 million
metric tons of the commodity bought for delivery in the marketing
year that began June 1.
   A metric ton is equal to about 2,205 pounds and 36.7 bushels of
wheat or 39.4 bushels of corn.
   Most of the Chinese purchases were in the last two weeks,
according to the Agriculture Department.
   During the marketing year that ended May 31, exporters sold 8.3
million metric tons of U.S. grain to China.
   China also buys poultry to breed, livestock semen, hogs and seed
to plant for animal feed, according to the Agriculture Department's
foreign agricultural service.
   By far, the largest commodity is grain, said a spokeswoman in
the department. China gets other products from Canada, Australia,
New Zealand and Europe, she said.
   Since former President Carter's grain embargo against the Soviet
Union for the December 1979 invasion of Afghanistan, the federal
government has opposed using agricultural products as foreign
policy weapons against countries.
   But that doesn't mean it won't refuse to extend the Export
Enhancement Program to China.
   The first 300,000 metric tons of wheat purchased this year by
China were under that discount program, but all the rest has been
bought at market prices.
   ``We must be absolutely clear that China's brutality against its
own people is unacceptable,'' said Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind.,
ranking Republican on the agriculture committee.
   ``At the same time, it's important that U.S. actions be moderate
and targeted against the government rather than the people of
China.''
   President Bush said Monday that weapons sales would be suspended
and ``other aspects of bilateral relationship'' would be reviewed.
   ``On the commercial side, I don't want to hurt the Chinese
people,'' Bush said during a news conference. ``I happen to believe
that commercial contacts have led, in essence, to this quest for
more freedom.''
   Rep. Kika de la Garza, D-Texas, chairman of the House
Agriculture Committee, said the United States should be committed
never to use food embargoes as a weapon because they ``are
ineffective and hurt both sides.''
   ``Food embargoes are never the answer, and particularly in this
case it could worsen the pain and suffering of the Chinese
people,'' he said.

   Oats and oat products can be sold to Canada
without import licenses because the level of U.S. government
subsidies for oats is less than Canada's, the two countries have
announced.
   The governments announced Monday that the U.S. support level for
oats is 8.74 percent, while in Canada it is 11.09 percent.
   Under the free trade agreement signed between the two countries
last year, Canada agreed to remove import licensing requirements if
U.S. support levels are equal to or less than those of Canada.
   Supports are government subsidies that put a floor under prices.
The U.S. mechanism for doing this is a price-support loan program
under which farmers use crops as collateral and are free to forfeit
and keep the money if that nets them a greater return than selling
on the market.
   Import licenses will be required for wheat and barley. The
support comparisons for those commodities are wheat, 61.62 percent
in the United States and 46.28 percent in Canada; barley, 72.49
percent in the United States and 50.23 percent in Canada.

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   RJR Nabisco Inc. said today that it sold five of
its European food businesses to the French food and beverage
company BSN for $2.5 billion.
   The sale will help reduce RJR Nabisco's massive debt following
the record $24.53 billion buyout by the investment firm Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. earlier this year.
   Sold to BSN were the United Kingdom biscuit business of Nabisco
Brands; U.K. snack makers Walker's Crisps and Smith's Crisps; The
Belin Group, a French biscuit and pastry business; and Saiwa, a
biscuit and snack producer in Italy.
   BSN, a leading food and beverage company in France, markets a
variety of biscuit, dairy and grocery products as well as beer,
champagne and mineral water.
   RJR Nabisco, based in Atlanta but in the process of relocating
to New York, put the European companies on the auction block May 9,
saying the prospective sale was needed to help to reduce the
company's overall debt by about $5.5 billion. The company's annual
interest payments alone total around $3 billion.
   ``For RJR Nabisco, the (European) sale represents an important
step toward achieving our goal of reducing the company's overall
debt,'' said RJR Nabisco Chairman Louis V. Gerstner Jr.
   ``At the same time, the size and strength of our food businesses
in North America continue to place RJR Nabisco among the world's
leading cookie, cracker and snack producers.''
   The European companies involved in the BSN deal had pretax
profit of $137 million on sales of $1.2 billion in 1988.

<HEAD>Sears Could Announce Out-of-State Move This Week, Reports Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. may announce this week
where it plans to move its Merchandise Group, and some employees
say the company's actions suggest it has picked a site out of
state, a newspaper reported today.
   The retail giant last week created a task force to help group
employees relocate and another to help their spouses find new jobs,
leading many to speculate Sears had decided to move out of the
Chicago area, a source in the company told the Chicago Tribune.
   But the paper, which did not identify the source, said a company
memo circulated last week denied that the creation of the task
forces implied a move out of Illinois. The Merchandise Group
employs 6,000 people.
   Sources told both the Tribune and the Chicago Sun-Times that it
appeared a decision on where to move the group would be announced
this week.
   The Tribune reported that Sears had decided against moving the
group to suburban Hoffman Estates, but had not ruled out a site
near O'Hare International Airport. Several cities in North
Carolina, Texas and other states are reportedly in the running.
   Sears officials have steadfastedly declined to comment publicly
on the rumors and reports of the company's intentions, and
spokesman Gordon Jones remained tight-lipped today.
   ``I'm not commenting on any of the reports,'' he said. ``All we
have said is that we would hope to make the announcement sometime
this month.''
   Sears, the nation's largest retailer, in October announced plans
to sell its landmark Sears Tower _ the world's tallest office
building _ and move the Merchandise Group out of the skyscraper.
   The move was part of a company restructuring that included a new
low pricing strategy and a paring of Sears' non-retail operations.

   The stock market rebounded today as concerns
about the political situation in China abated somewhat.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was up 14.34 to
2,495.04 as of 11 a.m. EDT after falling 37 points on Monday.
   Advancing issues were ahead of decliners by a margin of about 7
to 4, with 774 stocks rising, 454 falling and 517 unchanged on the
New York Stock Exchange.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 58.88 million shares after the
first 90 minutes of trading.
   Jack Barbanel, a first vice president with Gruntal &amp; Co. Inc.,
said the market, whose sharp decline Monday was partly attributed
to worries about China, believed that over the long-term the more
conservative side of the Chinese government would fall, leaving

   Although the market expected more fighting in China in the near

<TEXT>
   OPEC nations increased their oil
production to 21 million barrels a day in May, the highest output
so far this year, according to estimates released today.
   The International Energy Agency also predicted in its Monthly
Oil Market Report that demand for the cartel's oil would rise in
the second half of the year to about 20.85 million barrels a day,
up from a previous estimate of 20.4 million barrels.
   The ministers of the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries were meeting in Vienna to set new price and
production guidelines for the rest of the year. The ministers
opened their formal strategy meeting Monday, then adjourned to hold
private bargaining sessions.
   Estimates of demand for their crude were heavily influencing
discussions.
   Today, Mana Saeed Otaiba, oil minister of the United Arab
Emirates, a persistent overproducer in the cartel, said he would
like to see OPEC boost its daily production to between 20 million
and 21 million barrels from the current 18.5 million barrels.
   Otaiba refused to say how much he'd like of the extra output.
The primary issue in the talks, he said, ``is to get everybody
within the new umbrella of 20 or 20 plus (million barrels a day) as
a new ceiling.''
   ``There's definitely movement toward an agreement,'' said Iraq's
oil chief, Issam Abdul Raheem al-Chalabi, but he did not elaborate.
   No date was set for resumption of their formal talks.
   Anticipating more demand for their crude, the ministers seemed
intent on fixing a higher output ceiling _ of as much as 20 million
barrels a day _ for the second half of the year.
   The ministers also appeared to be leaning toward retaining their
benchmark price of $18 a barrel. Saudi Arabia has recommended
discontinuing the target price.
   The sticking point in their bargaining is how to divide up the
extra output among the 13 countries. Kuwait and the United Arab
Emirates want a bigger share of any increase.
   The energy agency's report said OPEC production in May rose
about 500,000 barrels from April.
   ``This was primarily the result of higher production in Kuwait
and Nigeria, partly offset by a small decline in Iranian and
Ecuadorian production,'' it said.
   Oil futures prices recently have been rising amid speculation
about the outcome of the OPEC meeting. Other developments also
helped drive up energy prices Monday, including the death of
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Soviet gas pipeline explosion and
turmoil in China.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the contract for July
delivery of West Texas intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S.
crude oil, rose 38 cents to $20.52 a barrel Monday. Prices of
refined products also rose.

   Northern Telecom Inc. will lay off 665
employees in Nashville as part of a massive reorganization
announced last December, company officials say.
   The company's Nashville office complex, which had 850 full-time
and part-time employees at the beginning of this year, will be
reduced to about 185 workers by year's end as its manufacturing
segment is shut down, the officials confirmed Monday.
   Spokesman Jeff Benson said many high-tech jobs and equipment
will be moved to other states, although the firm's headquarters and
a telephone refurbishing operation will remain in Nashville.
   The majority will go to Santa Clara, Calif., and Research
Triangle Park near Raleigh, N.C., Benson said.
   Northern Telecom Inc. is a subsidiary of Northern Telecom Ltd.,
which announced a reorganization Dec. 6 to cut employment worldwide
by 5 percent. Northern Telecom Ltd., based in Toronto, has 50,000
employees worldwide and 22,000 in the United States. Total revenues
last year were $5.4 billion, with two-thirds of that coming from
U.S. operations.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened mixed today on
the Chicago Board of Trade despite increased sales of wheat to
China.
   Monday's announcement that China has purchased 1.85 million
metric tons of wheat sent wheat prices higher in early trading
today, but prices moved lower as trading progressed.
   The wheat sale apparently had been negotiated over the previous
two weeks, said Jerry Gidel, an analyst with LIT America Inc. in
Chicago.
   Despite the announcement of the sale, analysts say there is
concern the turmoil in China could disrupt industry and commerce in
that huge commodity-trading nation.
   Corn prices were higher despite word that Egypt and Turkey have
made major corn purchases from France instead of the United States.
   Soybean prices were mostly higher, although the strong dollar is
expected to continue to hamper export sales.
   At the open, wheat was 1{ cents lower to } cent higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.94 a bushel; corn was a \ cent

   Three creditor banks have filed a petition to
force financially strapped Colorado-Ute Electric Association into
involuntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.
   Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., United Bank of Denver and
Norwest Bank Minneapolis, which are each owed $10 million, filed
the petition in federal bankruptcy court in Denver at the close of
business Monday.
   The filing, however, will not affect electric service to
Colorado-Ute's 14-member rural electric cooperatives, which in
turn, serve 49 of the state's 63 counties.
   Colorado-Ute serves nearly 600,000 Coloradans and is $1.1
billion in debt, with $877 million in assets.
   The utility has 20 days to respond to the banks' petition. If it
opposes the filing, a judge will hold a hearing to determine
whether the petiton is justified; otherwise, the case will proceed
as an ordinary Chapter 11 filing.
   Colorado-Ute said its two biggest creditors _ the federal Rural
Electrification Administration and the National Rural Electric
Cooperative Finance Corp. _ paved the way for Monday's filing by
refusing to accept a payback plan endorsed by the cooperative and
other creditors. The power supplier owes REA $417 million and CFC
$262 million.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee
is asking his colleagues to scrap President Bush's child care tax
credit proposal in favor of a plan that would help parents pay for
their children's day care and health insurance.
   In a memo sent to committee members Monday and obtained by The
Associated Press, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, proposed making the
current dependent care tax credit that is available to low- and
moderate-income families refundable in advance. A new credit _ up
to $500 a year _ would be created to help pay for health insurance
for children under age 19.
   Bentsen said the proposal would cost the Treasury $11.6 billion
over the next five fiscal years.
   He said the loss could be offset by added revenue the government
will reap when tax credits now extended to troubled financial
institutions expire next year and by making permanent the 3 percent
federal telephone excise tax. The phone tax is scheduled to drop to
2 percent on Jan. 1, 1990.
   In the memo, Bentsen asked committee members to vote on the plan
Wednesday. However, because of other Senate business he postponed
that action until next week and called off a planned news
conference at which he was to outline the legislation.
   Bentsen's ``children's initiative'' would replace the $2.5
billion tax-credit plan offered by Bush but is not intended to
undermine a separate child-care bill sponsored by Sen. Christopher
Dodd, D-Conn.
   Senate aides said Bentsen wanted his tax-credit package to be
passed in conjunction with the final version of Dodd's bill.
   The Dodd bill would provide federal funds for more child care
slots and set minimum federal standards for day care centers. Most
Republicans vigorously oppose the regulatory provisions of the Dodd
measure and Senate aides said they believed Bentsen wanted to keep
his measure as separate legislation to improve its chances of
passage unless a bipartisan agreement is reached on an overall
child-care package _ the subject of current negotiations.
   Bentsen, in the memo, said making the existing dependent care
credit refundable would provide cash for poor families who owe no
taxes, and who therefore would not benefit from a normal credit
against tax liability.
   Bush, in his child-care bill, also suggested making the existing
Dependent Care Tax Credit refundable.
   The president also proposed a new tax credit of up to $1,000 a
child, initially for families with incomes of between $8,000 and
$13,000, with the credit phasing in and by 1994 becoming available
to familes with incomes of up to $20,000.
   In outlining that proposal to a House committee last month,
Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole took a swipe at Dodd's plan.
   ``The child care needs of working Americans can best be met by
providing assistance to parents, not to providers; through state
and local regulations, not federal standards; through
community-based and public-private partnerships, not federal
bureaucracies; and by parental involvement, not federally mandated
procedures.''
   Critics of the Bush plan, while applauding the president's
motives, have said that creating a new credit and making parents
choose between it and the existing credit would only confuse
parents and perhaps cause them to avail themselves of neither.
Indeed, a Treasury Department tax expert at the hearing with Mrs.
Dole had trouble explaining the mechanics of the Bush proposal to
the committee.
   Bentsen made no mention of the Bush proposal in his memo but
aides said he believed broader application of the existing credit
was a better approach than creating a duplicative approach.
   The new health insurance credit proposed by Bentsen would allow
families with incomes of $12,000 or less to receive a tax credit
for up to 50 percent of the cost of insurance premiums for a child
under the age of 19. The maximum credit would be $500. Families
with incomes between $12,000 and $21,000 would be eligible for a
reduced credit, with the exact amount to be determined by income.
The health insurance credit, which would become effective in 1991,
could be paid out in advance if the taxpayer desired the money up
front.
   Bentsen also proposed allocating $25 million a year for the next
five years, through the Department of Health and Human Services,
for a program under which the federal government would pay up to 50
percent of the costs of programs to provide basic health care to
uninsured children under age 19 and their families.

   The stock market rebounded today as concerns
about the political situation in China abated somewhat and bargain
hunters moved into the market following Monday's sharp decline.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was up 19.85 to
2,500.55 as of noon EDT after falling 37 points on Monday.
   Advancing issues were ahead of decliners by a margin of about 7
to 4, with 844 stocks rising, 468 falling and 534 unchanged on the
New York Stock Exchange.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 85.44 million shares at midday.
   Jack Barbanel, a first vice president with Gruntal &amp; Co. Inc.,
said the market, whose sharp decline Monday was partly attributed
to worries about China, believed that over the long term, the more
conservative side of the Chinese government will fall, leaving more
democratic forces running the country.
   That could mean more fighting in China in the near future, but
traders were reassured by the possibility of peace there later on,
Barbanel said.
   Analysts also blamed Monday's drop on Wall Street to continuing
concern about the U.S. economy and to program selling.
   Buyers returned to the market today to take advantage of lower
prices, but Barbanel cautioned that there was still room for
further consolidation.

<HEAD>EEC Reopens Anti-Dumping Process On U.S. Propane Product</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Commission said Tuesday it
will consider whether to continue anti-dumping measures against
U.S. imports of propylene alcohol, a propane-derived product used
in making printing ink, paints and cosmetics.
   The U.S. producers of propylene alcohol are Union Carbide Corp.
of Danbury, Connecticut; Eastman Chemical International Co.,
Kingsport, Tenn., which is part of Eastman Kodak Co.; and Hoechst
Celanese Corp., a subsidiary of West Germany's Hoechst AG.
   Current anti-dumping measures against imports of U.S. propylene
alcohol were first decided in April 1984. They were due to expire
last year, but will be kept in force until the new investigation is
completed, the European Commission said.
   According to a commission statement, the anti-dumping case was
reopened at the request of the European Council of Chemical
Industry Federations (Cefic), a Brussels-based group representing
more than 80 percent of EEC production of the chemical.
   Cefic has alleged that U.S. producers export their product at
about 10 percent below their internal market price. According to
European producers, U.S. production capacity of 92,000 metric tons
a year exceeds U.S. internal demand by about 65,000 tons.
   Cefic said U.S. export of propylene alcohol to the EEC has risen
to 14,762 tons in 1988, worth roughly $10 million, from 6,758 tons
in 1985, even with the anti-dumping measures.
   Under the current measures, the U.S. companies have undertaken
not to undercut European companies' pricing in the EEC.

<TEXT>
   Democrats and Republicans bickered today over
whether to repeal a tax law that businesses find burdensome, as the
Senate struggled to complete a wide-ranging, $3.3 billion spending
bill.
   As the Senate began its third day of debate on the legislation,
Sen. Robert Kasten, R-Wis., offered an amendment repealing a
section of the 1986 tax-revision law that he said has ``wreaked
havoc'' on companies because of its complexity and costs.
   Democrats countered with a provision that conceded the tax
requirement is ``onerous'' and urged its reworking by Congress
later in the year.
   President Bush first asked Congress more than two months ago to
provide extra money for this year for several federal agencies.
Since then, the measure has grown not only in size but in breadth,
attracting an assortment of amendments ranging from U.S. policy in
Panama to work on an Ohio lake.
   Kasten's amendment revokes a requirement that businesses satisfy
a complex test to prove that their health insurance plans are not
more generous to upper echelon employees than they are to low-paid
workers. Companies have complained that the provision, which took
effect this year, has created mounds of paperwork. Small businesses
in particular have been unhappy.
   Kasten called the problem ``the No. 1 domestic issue in America
today'' in a written statement last week, and his amendment was
co-sponsored by at least 13 other GOP senators. Bush, Senate
Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, and House Ways
and Means Committee Chairman Daniel Rostenkowski, D-Ill., have said
the requirement needs to be reworked.
   Another amendment, to be offered by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
temporarily postpones the surtax now imposed on elderly Americans
as the price for new Medicare coverage of catastrophic care. Senior
citizens have complained about the expense, which will cost a
maximum of $850 in 1989 for the wealthiest Americans over age 65.
   Bush initially requested the legislation in March, seeking $2.2
billion for veterans, college students, forest fire costs and other
needs. By the time the House passed the bill last month, it had
grown to $3.7 billion, slightly surpassing the Senate's version.
   In the Senate, the legislation has garnered a slew of amendments
that range from the global to the parochial.
   A provision added last week directs the Army Corps of Engineers
to spend $500,000 this year on a project in Mill Creek Lake in
Ohio. The measure was sponsored by the state's two Democratic
senators, Howard Metzenbaum and John Glenn.
   The bill also picked up language sponsored by Sen. Dan Coats,
R-Ind., expressing the Senate's disinclination to approve a Panama
Canal Commission administrator named by Panamanian ruler Manuel
Antonio Noriega. By law, the chief of government of Panama can
nominate a new chief for the agency in January. That choice must be
approved by the Senate and by Bush, and the Senate served notice it
would not go along with the Panamanian strongman.
   The 1989 federal fiscal year runs through Sept. 30.

   Share prices rallied Tuesday to close
significantly higher on the London Stock Exchange, breaking a
five-day string of losses.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index rose 18.9
points, or 0.9 percent, to finish at 2,107.4, its best level of the
day. At its lowest, the index was down 10.9 points in early trading.
   The market opened lower on the back of Wall Street's fall Monday
and on continued worries about British interest rates and violence
in China.
   A bit of strength in the pound around midday, combined with some
bargain hunting and expectations of a higher opening on Wall
Street, started the London market moving higher.
   The rally gathered strength as Wall Street opened for business,
with the Dow Jones industrial average up about 20 points when
trading in London came to a close.
   The rally was driven in part by technical factors, as a short
supply of stock accentuated the effects of a small amount of
institutional buying, dealers said.
   Volume rose to a moderate 445.8 million shares from Monday's
359.2 million shares.

<HEAD>RJR Sells 5 European Units to French Company for $2.5 Billion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   RJR Nabisco Inc. said Tuesday it sold five of its
European businesses to BSN, a French food and beverage company, for
$2.5 billion in an effort to reduce some of its debt from a record
buyout.
   BSN bought the United Kingdom biscuit business of Nabisco
Brands; British snack food makers Walker's Crisps and Smith's
Crisps; The Belin Group, a French biscuit and pastry business; and
Saiwa, a biscuit and snack producer in Italy.
   The five European companies had pretax profit of $137 million on
sales of $1.2 billion in 1988.
   RJR Nabisco put the European units on the block last month,
saying the sales would be part of an effort to reduce the company's
overall debt by about $5.5 billion.
   In the wake of its $24.5 billion takeover by Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts &amp; Co., completed earlier this year, RJR has annual interest
payments of about $3 billion.
   The company has been expected to sell several assets in an
attempt to reduce that debt.
   Emanuel Goldman, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. in San
Francisco who follows RJR, said the BSN deal demonstrates that
there should be eager customers for any RJR units made available.
   ``This indicates that, indeed, the RJR properties are hot
properties,'' he said. ``It is one thing to project that, and
another to actually see it.''
   BSN and RJR are ranked one and two, respectively, in the biscuit
and snack food business in France, Goldman said, and the deal
reinforces BSN's powerhouse status at home.
   BSN did not have a major presence in the United Kingdom, though
RJR Nabisco did, Goldman added. ``All of a sudden, they (BSN) are a
big player in the British snack market,'' he said.
   BSN markets a variety of biscuit, dairy and grocery products, as
well as beer, champagne and mineral water.
   ``BSN has acquired five attractive food businesses, each
possessing strong brands, distribution and sales systems,
manufacturing facilities and management,'' RJR Chairman Louis V.
Gerstner Jr. said.
   ``As part of BSN, one of Europe's premier food and beverage
companies, these businesses should continue to develop and
prosper,'' he said.
   Gerstner said the sale, while helping RJR reduce its debt, will
not diminish the company's competitive standing.
   ``The size and strength of our food businesses in North America
continue to place RJR Nabisco among the world's leading cookie,
cracker and snack producers,'' he said.

exporter, has made a new oil find in the Khurais region southeast
of the capital of Riyadh, oil industry executives said Tuesday.
   Officials at the Saudi Aramco oil company, reached by telephone
from Bahrain, confirmed the report but refused to give details
about its potential.
   The company is based in the kingdom's Gulf city of Dhahran.
   The new find results from a large-scale high-technology
exploration program launched by Saudi Aramco in 1986, the company
officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   As part of the program, Saudi Aramco drilled a new wildcat well
in the Khurais region 125 miles southeast of Riyadh. The drillers
hit a small amount of oil in a reservoir and had some gas shows.
   First reports suggested that oil discovered in that region was
not in commercial amounts, but Saudi Aramco was optimistic about
the gas.
   Sources close to Saudi Aramco say the gas discovery was sizeable
and commercially viable, but the company officials declined to
confirm or deny the report.
   Saudi Aramco announced this year its proven oil reserves have
risen to 252 billion barrels from 169 billion barrels. Its annual
report for 1988 speculated that remaining reserves could be as high
as 315 billion barrels.
   Saudi Arabia has the world's largest known oil reserves. Almost
all are in areas managed by Saudi Aramco, which has discovered 52
oil fields and one commercial gas field in 55 years of exploration.

   Stock prices were slightly higher today as Wall
Street was unable to sustain a rebound from Monday's sharp decline.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was up 0.18 to
2,480.88 as of 2 p.m. EDT. The average, which was up about 20
points in earlier trading today, fell 37 points on Monday.
   Advancing issues were just ahead of decliners today with 743
stocks rising, 694 falling and 511 unchanged on the New York Stock

   Volume on the Big Board came to 132.1 million shares at
midafternoon.
   The recovery from Monday's drop lasted into the early afternoon
but then fizzled. Jack Solomon, a market analyst with Bear, Stearns

hard smash,'' but he added that it wasn't strong enough to reverse
the downward trend begun in the previous session.
   Analysts attributed today's earlier gains to bargain-hunting and
waning concerns about the situation in China.
   Solomon said program trading, which contributed to Monday's
decline, also was evident in today's selling.

   Paramount Communications Inc., formerly known as
Gulf &amp; Western Inc., said Tuesday its second-quarter profit rose 18
percent, as strong results in entertainment and financial services
more than offset seasonally weak results from educational
publishing.
   On a separate matter, the company declined comment on a
published report in USA Today that Paramount was weighing making a
bid for Time Inc., which is already in an agreement to merge with
Warner Communications Inc.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Paramount was up 37{
cents a share at $33.37{ at midday while Time was up $2.75 a share
at $126.
   In its earnings report, Paramount reported net income of $65.6
million, or 55 cents a share, in the three months ended April 30
compared with $55.5 million, or 46 cents a share, a year earlier.
   The 1988 earnings results included a net gain of $4.8 million
from the sale of the company's 30 percent interest in a
videocassette duplication business.
   Second-quarter revenue rose 12.7 percent to $699 million from
$620 million a year earlier. The revenue figures exclude results
from The Associates, the consumer and commercial finance business
that Paramount put up for sale in April.
   For the first six months of the year, Paramount said it earned
$134.8 million, or $1.13 a share, up 12 percent from $120.2
million, or $1 a share, a year earlier.
   Six-month revenue, excluding The Associates, rose 10.5 percent
to $1.47 billion from $1.33 billion a year earlier.
   Paramount did not break out its quarterly and six-month revenue
figures for The Associates.
   Martin S. Davis, chairman of Paramount, said he expects oprating
income from entertainment and publishing this year would
approximate the $432 million reported 1988. He said 1989 earnings
including results from The Associates to the date of its sale would
exceed the 1988 total of $384.7 million.
   In the second quarter, he said income from continuing operations
included record contributions from the entertainment business, due
to sharp increases in Paramount Pictures' operations and gains by
its Madison Square Garden unit.
   The entertainment results included the success of the movie
``The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad'' and the
syndication of television show ``Star Trek: The Next Generation''
and strong sales to pay cable services.
   Madison Square Garden operations benefitted from higher
attendance at New York Knickerbocker basketball games, NBA league
expansion revenues and increased ticket sales at New York Rangers
hockey games which more than offset a decline at the MSG Network, a
cable service that had higher costs associated with the startup of
its New York Yankees cablecasts this spring.
   Publishing results reflected seasonal losses in educational
operations, which traditionally have their highest sales in the
second half of the year.

<HEAD>Report: U.S. Needs More, Better On-the-Job Training</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. employers must train workers more and better
and reward enhanced skills to remain competitive internationally,
according to a study released Tuesday by the American Society for
Training and Development.
   ``The United States can educate and train employees outside the
workplace until it is blue in the face, but if employers do not
design institutions and jobs that use and reward learning, all
efforts will make little difference,'' the report said.
   The study was released at the annual meeting here of the
45-year-old Alexandria, Va.-based society, which represents nearly
50,000 professionals involved in employer-based training.
   The group includes managers, administrators, educators and
researchers who devise in-house training. Their work ranges from
teaching illiterate workers to read, to improving sales and
customer service skills, to educating executives in running a
company.
   ``Analysis of the available data and case studies of individual
employers leads to the conclusion that employers' current
commitments to training and development are probably
insufficient,'' the report said.
   It said that while learning in the workplace can boost
individual opportunity and corporate competitiveness, ``learning
has a relatively low standing and low frequency in the American
workplace.''
   Citing federal Bureau of Labor Statistics data, the report said
11 percent of American workers receive formal training and 14
percent get informal on-the-job training to prepare for jobs.
   By the year 2000, the report said, 65 percent of all jobs will
require some training or education beyond high school, compared
with 54 per cent now.
   The report recommended that:
   _Employers set short-term targets of spending 2 percent of
payroll on formal training and increasing the proportion of workers
tapped for extra training to nearly 15 percent, from 10 percent
now. The long-term goal should be 4 percent of payroll costs to
train 30 percent of employees.
   _The government create tax incentives to induce employers to
improve the quality of worker training.
   _Employers and educators join to raise the level of workplace
training and education.
   _Firms establish workplace incentives for advanced training
through performance-based selection, appraisal and rewards.
   The study was the second in a month to warn that weak job
training was hurting U.S. productivity.
   A two-year Massachusetts Institute of Technology study called
``Made in America'' concluded that national proseprity was
undermined by industrial weakness. It recommended that companies
offer workers more on-the-job training and learning opportunities
to improve productivity.

<HEAD>Eds: Leads with decision by aircraft maker to evacuate staff; edits

<TEXT>
   Douglas Aircraft Co. became the latest big U.S.
company to pull expatriate workers from strife-racked China today,
chartering a plane to withdraw its 51 people from Shanghai and two
other cities.
   The move by the division of McDonnell Douglas Corp., a partner
in a joint-venture aircraft assembly plant outside Shanghai, was an
about-face from the company's position a day earlier when it said
business was normal.
   The company also became one of the first U.S. businesses to
charter a plane for evacuations and one of the first with big
operations outside Beijing to withdraw. Up to now most of the
evacuees have been from the capital, which has been in turmoil
since the weekend when troops killed hundreds of civilians.
   ``We've changed our situation in China. We decided last night to
begin pulling our people out of China back to Hong Kong,'' Douglas
Aircraft spokesman Donald Hanson said from company headquarters in
Long Beach, Calif. ``The situation apparently has changed
overnight.''
   Hanson said the company's 43 people based just outside Shanghai,
seven people based in the southwest city of Chengdu and one
representative in the northeast industrial center of Shenyang would
leave as soon as possible.
   Many other U.S. businesses that had reacted cautiously toward
China's political crisis also have been withdrawing workers from
Beijing and a growing number are becoming gloomy about the
longer-term impact to their investments.
   ``Now with this random shooting in Beijing it's no longer fun.
Anyone who approaches a window risks his life,'' Jerome Cohen, an
international lawyer who helped pioneer the American business
presence in China, said Monday.
   ``With respect to our own staff, I think it is time to withdraw
for a while,'' said Cohen, whose firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind,
Wharton &amp; Garrison has offices in China. ``Until this weekend I
thought that was unwarranted. But now we have to think of people's
safety.''
   United Airlines, the only U.S. carrier to Beijing, was heavily
booked on its 400-seat flight out of the capital today, spokeswoman
Sara Dornacker said.
   By early this afternoon the airline had not added any flights,
although there were reports the U.S. embassy in Beijing was trying
to charter planes to help evacuate American nationals.
   Ms. Dornacker said UAL was continuing to deliberately delay the
Tokyo-Beijing leg of its regular U.S.-to-Beijing flight by 15 hours
to avoid an overnight layover in the capital, fearing the airport
might close.
   Northwest Airlines spokesman Kevin Whalen said earlier that the
airline's Tokyo-Shanghai flight also was delayed to minimize ground
time in Shanghai, ``just because the situation is so fluid there.''
   Robert Cox, a senior executive of the international law firm of
Baker &amp; Mckenzie, said his China-based staffers had left for Hong
Kong because of the concern for personal safety, and ``clients are
dealing with the situation there the same as we are.''
   ``The implications of this are profound,'' Cox said. ``I don't
see how anyone doing business there couldn't set those plans in a
state of suspension.''
   U.S. business reaction to the chaos in China is particularly
important because American investment is one of the biggest
influences on the country's effort to modernize.
   More than 600 U.S.-Chinese joint ventures have been signed since
Washington and Beijing normalized relations 10 years ago, with
American investment there totaling at least $3.5 billion. The
United States is one of China's biggest trading partners.
   ``A political uncertainty and a standoff is one thing. A
massacre is another,'' said Martin Weil, a spokesman for the U.S.
China Business Council, a Washington-based organization of American
companies. ``Everybody's going to have to factor that in.''
   General Electric Co., International Business Machines Corp. and
Chrysler Corp. were among companies that said they had evacuated
people because of the violence in Beijing and the growing
uncertainty elsewhere in the country.

<TEXT>
   CNW Corp.'s board of directors today approved a
$1.6 billion buyout offer made by a corporation including CNW
management, ending a two-month hostile takeover bid by Japonica
Partners.
   The corporation was formed by Blackstone Capital Partners LP and
includes Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Inc., a New York-based
securities firm, and the Union Pacific Corp., CNW officials said.
   Japonica announced in New York it was terminating its bid
because of the deal and said it would decide whether to sell some
or all of its CNW shares.
   The agreement calls for acquisition of CNW by Blackstone and a
management group led by company chairman and chief executive
officer Robert Schmiege for $45.50 per share in cash, and $4.50 per
share of pay-in-kind preferred stock with a 17 percent dividend
rate.
   Blackstone, a private New York investment banking firm, will
hold a controlling interest in CNW under the agreement.
   The transaction , valued at $1.6 billion, is based upon
approximately 19 million CNW shares outstanding and the assumption
of CNW debt.
   The offer was approved by a special CNW board committee that was
evaluating bids for the Chicago-based rail company.
   CNW is the parent of the Chicago and Northwestern Transportation
Co., a 6,000-mile railroad with 8,500 employees that operates in
nine states, most of them in the Midwest.
   Japonica, CNW's largest shareholder with an 8.8 percent stake,
has been attempting a takeover since April 27. Japonica's
$44-a-share offer values CNW at $722 million.
   New York-based Japonica is headed by two former Goldman Sachs &
Co. investment bankers, Paul B. Kazarian and Michael Lederman.
   Japonica officials did not immediately return telephone calls
seeking comment.
   Bethlehem, Pa.-based Union Pacific Railroad relies heavily on
the North Western's Chicago-to-Fremont, Neb., line for east-west
freight traffic. The Union Pacific accounts for about 40 percent of
the North Western's shipments, analysts say.
   Union Pacific recently paid $1.5 million for an option to buy
the Iowa Interstate Railroad, a regional line between Iowa and
Chicago. Officials said the line would have served as a substitute
to the North Western should a hostile takeover disrupt freight
service.
   Officials of Japonica had said they planned to sell CNW's real
estate, excess equipment and Chicago-area commuter lines if their
takeover bid was successful.
   The railroad's union on Friday made a proposal to buy the
company that would have given employees a one-third stake in the
railroad.

<HEAD>Wheat Prices Drop Despite China Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed lower
Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade, with wheat prices falling
despite announcement of a major sale to the People's Republic of
China.
   Monday's announcement that China purchased 1.85 million metric
tons of wheat was expected to be a boost to prices, but that didn't
happen.
   ``The sale was already factored into the market so there was
some liquidation,'' said Jon Horton, an analyst with Research
Department Inc. in Chicago.
   Horton noted that there was also some commercial selling of
wheat futures because of a lack of business.
   ``There is so much uncertainty in China, people aren't willing
to pay $4 a bushel for wheat, which what it was getting to,'' he
said.
   Corn prices dropped in a spillover from the sale of wheat
futures, despite word from the Agriculture Department that recent
severe weather in Ohio could prevent planting of about 50 percent
of that state's planned corn crop.
   Soybean prices fell as investors purchased old crop futures and
sold new crop. Analysts say the strong dollar is expected to
continue to hamper export sales.
   At the close, wheat was } cent to 3 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.92{ a bushel; corn was 1\ cents
lower to } cent higher with July at $2.63{ a bushel; oats were 2
cents to 3{ cents lower with July at $1.65{ a bushel; soybeans were
3 cents lower to 1{ cents higher with July at $7.07 a bushel.

<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines union leaders told striking
workers Tuesday to remain optimistic about a possible buyout, but
the troubled carrier said the prospects of a deal were dead.
   A federal bankruptcy judge Monday said Eastern should begin
negotiating on plans to reorganize as a smaller carrier after an
investor group led by the unions and a Chicago businessman failed
to put together a takeover deal.
   ``The fat lady just sang,'' Eastern spokesman Jim Ashlock said.
   ``I can tell you it's absolutely untrue,'' Frank Ortis, vice
president of the Machinists local, told members at the union hall
who gathered to discuss apparent bad news in their three-month-old
strike. ``So let's hang in there.''
   Eastern said the ruling by Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland
ended buyout possibilities by Chiacgo commodities trader Joseph
Ritchie and the unions, who nonetheless maintained it was alive.
   Joel Zweibel, the attorney for the committee representing major
creditors, said in court the proposal was ``interesting and
constructive'' but wouldn't be possible without Eastern approval.
   The group met Saturday with representatives of Eastern parent
Texas Air Corp. but failed to win support for the buyout plan,
which included a $100 million equity investment and $210 million in
union wage concessions.
   The judge directed Eastern to begin talks with creditors over
the company's plan to sell $1.8 billion in assets and reorganize in
bankruptcy court as a smaller carrier.
   Lifland said the Ritchie group could continue discussing its
offer with creditors, but that the court no longer would consider
it unless it was acceptable to Eastern.
   ``It's always there in the minds of some who would like to keep
it alive,'' Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said, but added:
``There are no buyers out there.''
   But pilots union spokesman Ron Cole countered that Lifland did
not kill the Ritchie bid or give approval to the Texas Air Chairman
Frank Lorenzo's awaited reorganization plan.
   Cole said the unions believe the creditors will reject the
rebuilding plan, which focuses on mass asset sales the union says
would leave Eastern too crippled to compete.
   The unions also contend that management won't be able to hire
enough qualified pilots and mechanics.
   ``We don't think Mr. Lorenzo is going to find enough
professional people to put his airline back without the unions,''
said Wally Haber, a Machinists general chairman. ``He's got people
out there, but they're round pegs for square holes.''
   The pilots union urged its members not to ``make any rash
decisions'' based on what the union called inaccurate information
from news reports about Lifland's ruling.
   Ritchie set a meeting for Wednesday in Washington between his
group and David I. Shapiro, the court-appointed examiner for
Eastern.
   ``I thought the unions were grasping at straws,'' said Mark
Daugherty, a Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. analyst. ``I think it's
pretty much dead now.''
   Eastern sought bankruptcy protection from creditors on March 9,
five days after pilots and flight attendants joined striking ground
workers represented by the Machinists union in a walkout that
virtually grounded the airline.
   Under bankruptcy law, Eastern has the exclusive right until
early July to submit a reorganization plan. Eastern's lead
attorney, Harvey Miller, said Monday that Eastern probably would
propose its plan within two to three weeks.
   Eastern already has discussed an outline of a reorganization
scheme with the creditors' committee, Miller said.

<TEXT>
   MCI Communications Corp. has won its biggest
contract ever, a five-year, $150 million deal to provide Merrill
Lynch &amp; Co. with a worldwide network for voice and data
communications, the companies said Tuesday.
   The deal is the latest in a series of such links, as big phone
customers turn over the construction of state-of-the-art
international networks to the big phone companies.
   General Electric Co. said last week it had selected American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., British Telecom and France Telecom to
build the first phase of its international network. The value of
that deal was not disclosed.
   Merrill Lynch said it expects to reduce its costs by more than
$100 million over the five-year period.
   ``After an intensive review of our communications strategy and
future needs, we chose MCI because of its ability to meet the
technical and management demands of our business environment, the
flexibility and responsiveness of its people, and its commitment to
the next generation of communications technology,'' William
Schreyer, Merrill's chairman and chief executive, said in a
statement.
   ``Together we are stepping into the future of information
management,'' Bert C. Roberts Jr., MCI's president and chief
operating officer, said in the statement.
   MCI will use private lines to connect the firm's New York and
New Jersey headquarters with its 500 domestic branch offices and
with offices in Tokyo, London, Singapore, Toronto, Sidney,
Australia and Berne, Switzerland. Switches in those foreign offices
will serve as gateways for calls to and from other points.
   The system will be built around Merrill Lynch's existing
backbone of private lines.
   The choice of MCI culminates a process that began last September
when MCI asked for proposals from the three main long-distance
companies, MCI, AT&amp;T and US Sprint Communications Co.

of Brooklyn, with illegal use of a legal tax-saving device last
year.
   The Sterns sold printing equipment from two companies they owned
to Bell so they could generate a cash profit. They then leased back
the equipment so they could use it while writing off the lease cost
as a business expense, according to the indictment.
   If the Sterns had kept the equipment in the first place, the
only financial advantage would have been the annual depreciation
for taxes.
   Such transactions are legal, but the indictment said the Sterns
sold property to Bell that was ``greatly overvalued and in some
instances was owned by others and in some instances did not exist.''
   In one case, according to Assistant District Attorney George
Donahue, the Sterns bought the Mayflower Printing Co. in June 1988
for $50,000 and sold it and nonexistent assets to Bell Atlantic for
$600,000 a few months later.
   To keep the scheme going, the Sterns allegedly used phony
financial statements and invoices and fictitious eople.
   In another case, the Sterns used their lawyer's bank account to
steal $265,000 from Morgan Guaranty, Donahue said.
   The Sterns aface up to 25 years in jail if convicted of the top
count of first-degree grand larceny.

   Prices closed moderately higher in see-saw
trading on Wall Street today as stocks partially recovered from
Monday's sharp decline.
   The market surged higher in early trading, then retraced its
steps in mid-afternoon before advancing again before the close.
   Analysts said the uncertainty over the political situation in
China and Iran that led to Monday's 37-point drop in the Dow Jones
industrial average had apparently abated, and that bargain-hunters
had moved into the market.
   Alfred E. Goldman, a vice president at A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc.
in St. Louis, said the comeback late in today's session indicated
Wall Street's momentum was still on an upward track.

   Energy futures prices weakened slightly Tuesday
as OPEC ministers struggled to reach an agreement on raising crude
oil production.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the contract for July
delivery of West Texas intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S.
crude oil, dipped 6 cents to $20.46 per 42-gallon barrel following
Monday's rise of 38 cents. Prices of refined petroleum products
posted larger declines.
   The crude contract held up well given the developments at the
conference of ministers representing the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, said Chris McCormack, an energy broker at
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   ``All the news to me seems to be bearish. The bickering among
members about production, quotas and allocations was a negative
influence on energy prices,'' said McCormack.
   Negotiations among the cartel ministers meeting in Vienna bogged
down Tuesday as they tried to agree on allotting a proposed
cartel-wide oil production increase among its 13 member nations.
   Some members are believed to favor dividing any additional
production evenly but Kuwait apparently has demanded a larger share
while several other countries would like special treatment.
   On production, the ministers are considering a proposal to
increase the cartel's output ceiling from the current 18.5 million
barrels a day to 19.5 million in the July-December period.
   The United Arab Emirates, however, favors a boost to between 20
million barrels and 21 million barrels.
   As the OPEC discussions were taking place, a new report was
released which estimated that current production by OPEC members
far exceeds the self-imposed quota.
   The International Energy Agency said OPEC nations produced oil
at a daily rate of 21 million barrels last month, the highest
amount so far this year.
   Energy market analysts said the violence in China and the
problems stemming from the explosion of a natural gas pipeline in
the Soviet Union had little impact on prices Tuesday. These events
had been among the factors responsible for Monday's gains.
   The July contract for No. 2 heating oil, which rose 1.87 cents
Monday, fell 0.91 cent to 51.00 cents a gallon on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. The contract for July delivery of unleaded
gasoline settled at 64.94 cents a gallon, off 0.86 cent, almost
erasing Monday's increase of 0.95 cent.

<HEAD>European Companies to Develop New Military Aircraft</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five European aerospace companies have decided to
develop a new generation of military transport aircraft for the late
1990s, France's Aerospatiale said Tuesday.
   Henri Martre, chairman of the state-owned company, said the
European companies have decided to form a new industrial alliance
called European Future Large Aircraft Group, or Euroflag. The group
will study a new military plane to replace the aging Franco-German
Transall and the C130 Hercules made by Lockheed-Georgia Co. of the
United States, he said.
   In addition to Aerospatiale, the companies associated in Euroflag
are British Aerospace PLC, Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm Gmbh of West
Germany, Casa of Spain and Italy's Aeritalia. The first four
companies are already partners in Airbus Industrie, the European
consortium that builds the Airbus family of commercial jets.
   Martre told reporters the agreement effectively puts an end to a
previous accord called Future International Military Airlifter, or
FIMA, in which the same five European companies were associated with
Lockheed.
   The new consortium will continue to have relations with Lockheed,
such as consulting on market surveys, Martre said, but the group
will also be talking to other U.S. aircraft manufacturers.
   The European companies and Lockheed have been carrying out
preliminary studies of a new military transport aircraft for several
years, in anticipation of NATO's need to find a successor to the
Hercules and the Transall, which is made jointly by Aerospatiale and
West Germany's MBB.
   But NATO has so far failed to come up with any definition of the
kind of the aircraft that it requires.
   Industry observers said the Europeans decided to take advantage
of the uncertainty surrounding NATO's intentions to break their
formal ties with Lockheed.
   The decision means they will be able to link up with the U.S.
company that is eventually selected to produce the American version
of the aircraft.

   OPEC negotiations stalled Tuesday as
cartel ministers tried to hammer out an agreement on how to allot a
proposed cartel-wide production increase among its 13 member
nations.
   ``I can certainly say there's a spirit of reaching an
understanding. ...(But) a lot of work needs to be done,'' said
Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh.
   ``It's a deadlock,'' said a delegate from one nation, who
demanded anonymity.
   Continuing talks over a possible hike in the official production
ceiling came as a new report indicated the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries lifted output in May to its highest
level of the year, surpassing its current ceiling.
   An offical of one delegation said a proposal had been made to
raise the cartel's output ceiling from the current 18.5 million
barrels a day to 19.5 million in the July-December period.
   The additional production would be divided proportionately among
all members, said the official, who demanded anonymity.
   Kuwait has insisted on a larger share and several other
countries would like special treatment.
   The United Arab Emirates' Mana Saeed Otaiba told reporters he
wanted OPEC to boost its daily production limit to between 20
million barrels and 21 million barrels.
   The nation persistently has pumped more than its individual
quota, although Otaiba refused to say how much he would like of the
proposed additional cartel output. ``As much as we can get we would
love to have,'' he said.
   ``The key issue is to get everybody within the new umbrella of
20 or 20 plus (million barrels a day) as a new ceiling,'' said
Otaiba.
   Other members have said no country should be given more output
than others.
   Libya's Fawzi Shakshuki said if another country wins ``special
treatment ...Libya will ask for that.''
   The OPEC ministers have been trying to resolve their disputes
since last Friday. They opened a formal strategy conference Monday
before returning to private bargaining.
   OPEC nations agreed last November on a production ceiling of
18.5 million barrels a day for the January-June period, well under
actual output levels of that time, in an attempt to support a price
of $18 a barrel for their oil.
   Prices have risen since then, with the price of a basket of
crudes monitored by OPEC now more than 40 percent above the level
of late November.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the contract for July
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark American crude,
closed down 6 cents Tuesday at $20.46 a 42-gallon barrel.
   The ministers apparently have settled on retaining the $18
benchmark, although Saudi Arabia had recommended scrapping the
target price.
   ``OPEC seems to be happy with a pricing level around $18,'' said
Otaiba.
   Separately, the International Energy Agency reported the OPEC
nations lifted their crude production by 500,000 barrels a day in
May to 21 million barrels, the highest amount so far this year.
   Higher production by Kuwait and Nigeria accounted for much of
the May increase, it said.
   The agency's Monthly Oil Market Report estimated Saudi Arabia
produced 4.8 million barrels a day in May. Its OPEC-set supply
quota is 4.5 million barrels a day.
   Iran and Iraq each produced about 2.8 million barrels a day in
May, it said.
   The output for Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates was estimated
at 1.6 million barrels a day, well above their OPEC supply quotas
of about a million barrels a day.
   Nigeria produced some 1.6 million barrels a day, ahead of its
supply target of about 1.4 million barrels.
   The report estimated Venezuela's production at 1.6 million
barrels a day, the same as its quota, and Ecuador's at 300,000
barrels, up from its quota of 230,000 barrels.
   Other production estimates were: Libya, 1 million barrels;
Algeria, 700,000 barrels; Indonesia, 1.2 million barrels; Libya, 1
million barrels; and Gabon, 200,000 barrels.

<HEAD>Creditors Seek Involuntary Bankruptcy Against Electronics Retailer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of five creditors filed a petition
Tuesday for involuntary bankruptcy against electronics retailer
Crazy Eddie to try to recoup $860,000 from the company that once
boasted ``insane'' prices.
   Crazy Eddie has 20 days to contest the petition before it must
liquidate its assets, said Michael Fox, an attorney for the
creditors.
   The company also has the option of filing for bankruptcy under
Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law, he said.
   A Crazy Eddie spokesman, who would not give his name, said the
company's board of directors was meeting late Tuesday and planned to
issue a statement.
   The petition, filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan,
represents Cobra Electronics Group of Dynascan Corp.; Phonemate,
Inc.; Code-A-Phone Corp.; Southwestern Bell Telecommunications Inc.;
and Northwestern Bell Phones, an affiliate of U S West Company.
   Crazy Eddie, known for its frenetic broadcast commercials
claiming that ``Our prices are insane!'' announced in March that it
was closing 17 of its 43 stores overnight in a bid to cut losses.
   At the time, the Edison, N.J.-based company said a drop in sales
compounded by a massive inventory shortage, excessive long-term debt
and ``certain unprofitable locations'' had drained its working
capital.
   In their petition, the five creditors claim Crazy Eddie is
liquidating its assets without taking into account the debts to its
creditors.
   ``Crazy Eddie has been the subject of speculation about its
financial condition for several months,'' Fox said in statement. ``A
pending shareholder lawsuit, continued operating losses and the
departure of key personnel have further eroded investor and supplier
confidence in the discounter.''
   Fox said an unofficial committee of major creditors that was
formed to negotiate with Crazy Eddie had failed to reach an accord.
   ``My clients believe that it is in their best interests ... that
the bankruptcy court become involved,'' he said.
   Crazy Eddie's stock closed at 25 cents a share in
over-the-counter trading Tuesday, unchanged from the previous close.
The stock is down from 53 cents in March and had been as high as $21
three years ago.

   The price of gold shot up nearly $12 an ounce in
late trading Tuesday, while the dollar sagged.
   Some dealers said gold rallied in a belated response to the
turmoil in China, but others said technical factors were behind the
late spurt. The dollar was actually lower earlier Tuesday in Hong
Kong, which is most sensitive to what happens in China.
   Republic National Bank of New York said gold was bid at $376.70 a
troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from $364.80 on Monday. That brought
it back to its levels of early May, but still well below the levels
of January, when it was over $400 an ounce.
   The rally began in New York when some futures traders who had
sold gold short in anticipation of a decline became nervous and
decided to buy gold to even their books, said Bernard Savaiko,
senior metals analyst at PaineWebber Inc.
   ``It seemed to feed on itself as the day progressed,'' he said.
   There was no major economic news to account for the retreat of
the dollar after its gains Monday.
   A pattern of sharp, unexplained drops in the dollar indicated the
Federal Reserve might have sold dollars secretly, said Michael
McGuinness, an investment officer in foreign exchange at Harris
Trust &amp; Savings Bank in Chicago.
   Several traders have speculated in the past two weeks that the
Federal Reserve and other central banks are trying to get extra
impact from their intervention by concealing it more than in the
past.
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound. It cost
$1.5665 to buy one pound, compared to $1.5815 late Monday. Later in
New York the pound rose to $1.5710 from $1.5655 on Monday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rosed 1.98 yen to a closing 142.63 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 143.28 yen. In New York the dollar fell to 142.67
yen from 142.95.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.9735 West German marks, down from 1.9855; 1.7095
Swiss francs, down from 1.7140; 1.2010 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2019; 6.7060 French francs, down from 6.7455; and 1,434 Italian
lire, down from 1,442.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday:
1.9850 West German marks, up from 1.9630; 1.7240 Swiss francs, up
from 1.6950; 6.7360 French francs, up from 6.6645; 2.2370 Dutch
guilders, up from 2.2010; 1,443.00 Italian lire, up from 1,416.50;
1.2015 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2003.
   In Hong Kong, gold fell $3.76 a troy ounce to close at a bid of
$365.44.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $365.25 per troy
ounce, compared with late Monday's $366.25. In Zurich, gold dropped
to a bid of $365.30 compared with $366.00 late Monday.
   But on the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for
current delivery rose to $379.90 a troy ounce from $367.50 on Monday.
   Silver bullion prices rose on the London market where the metal
was trading at a late bid price of $5.28 a troy ounce, compared with
Monday's $5.31. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current
delivery rose to $5.431 an ounce from $5.264 on Monday.

<HEAD>Stocks Close Higher After Choppy Session</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The stock market closed moderately higher after a
choppy session Tuesday marked by continued program trading and
nervousness about the situation in China.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 15.62 to close at
2,496.32.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by a margin of about
3 to 2 in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed
stocks, with 927 up, 584 down and 500 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 187.57 million
shares, up from 163.42 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 223.61 million shares.
   The market began the day on the up side, with the Dow Jones
industrial average climbing up about 20 points. But the market gave
back virtually all its gains in the early afternoon and then swung
upward again before the close.
   Jack Barbanel, a vice president with Gruntal &amp; Co. Inc.,
attributed Tuesday's volatility to continued uncertainty about the
political upheaval in China and concern about Iran following the
death of Ayatollah Khomeini over the weekend.
   However, he said stock prices gained support from firmness in the
bond market. By late afternoon, the Treasury's closely-watched
30-year bond gained $3.75 for every $1,000 in face amount, while its
yield, which moves in an opposite direction from its price, fell to
under 8.40 percent from 8.43 percent late Monday.
   Program trading, which contributed to a sharp 37-point decline in
the Dow Jones industrial average on Monday, was again evident
Tuesday, Barbanel said.
   Barbanel predicted trading would remain choppy until Friday, when
the Labor Department issues its producer price report for May. The
markets believe the report, a key inflation indicator, may provide
some clue as to the Fed's next move.
   Despite Tuesday's uneven session, Alfred E. Goldman, a vice
president with A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. in St. Louis, said the
market still appeared strong.
   ``Stocks had plenty of opportunity to head south, but they didn't
and this tells me that momentum was up,'' he said.
   But he also advised caution: ``The music is still being played _
I would just be dancing a little bit closer to the exits.''
   Leading the NYSE's most active list was RJR Holdings, which rose
{ to 23 after RJR Nabisco said it was selling five food businesses
for $2.5 billion. The sales were expected as part of the company's
plan to reduce debt following its acquisition by Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts &amp; Co.
   American Cynamid, which announced Monday it would acquire Praxis
Biologics Inc. for about $237 million in securities, was down 2\ to
53\
   CNW, which said it was being bought out for $1.6 billion by a
management-led investor group, was up } to 47{.
   Boeing rose 1[ to 76}, rebounding from sharp declines in previous
sessions.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market rose $16.662 billion, or 0.52
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.04 to 180.93.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index moved up 2.58 to 371.10, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index advanced 2.21 to 324.24.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market picked
up 0.12 to 447.96. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 360.84, up 1.26.

<HEAD>Governor Touts Alaska Tourism, Says Tourists Have Nothing To Fear
From Spill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RORY MARSHALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alaska's governor and tourism officials, fearing
that Americans picture their state as a soiled paradise since the
biggest oil spill in U.S. history, began a damage-control tour
Tuesday to promote the vast reaches unaffected by the disaster.
   ``If you went to Alaska and if you wanted to see the oil, you
would have to go to a pretty substantial expense and a lot of
trouble to do so,'' Gov. Steve Cowper told a news conference.
   Tourism is a $750 million-a-year industry for Alaska, and ranks
behind only oil and seafood among the state's biggest industries,
Dow said.
   Cowper and other Alaska officials emphasized that as large as the
March 24 spill was, it was virtually lost amid the state's huge
unaffected expanses of land and water.
   Cowpwr said the spill affected only 2 percent of Alaska's 6,640
miles of coastline. That included just 5 percent of the shoreline
within Prince William Sound, where the tanker Exxon Valdez ran
aground and spilled 10.9 million gallons of crude.
   Thomas M. Dow, president of the Alaska Visitors Association, a
tourism industry group, showed slides taken since the spill,
portraying untouched beaches within the sound, a cruise ship
crossing the sound, and sea lions in the area where the spill
drifted.
   ``There's no hiding from the fact that it's been a tragedy,'' Dow
said. ``But for visitors, few if any will see its impacts on these
remote areas.''
   Officials have no firm projections how many potential visitors
may be deterred by the oil spill, but sport-fishing lodge operators
have reported inquiries from their customers and some outright
reservation cancellations, Cowper said.
   Like commercial fishermen, tour operators and others in tourism
will be entitled to compensation from Exxon if they can show damages
as a result of the spill, Cowper said.
   The state spent $10.8 million on tourism promotion in 1988, and
the Legislature budgeted $11.4 million for this year.
   This year's budget is supplemented by $4 million from Exxon, part
of which is financing this week's promotion trip to Seattle and New
York, as well as print and television advertising.
   One of the ads shows a picture of a smiling Marilyn Monroe
without her beauty mark. ``Without it, the picture may have changed,
but her beauty hasn't,'' the ad reads. ``The same is true of
Alaska.''
   In addition, 154,000 copies of a letter from Cowper were sent to
people who had inquired about visiting Alaska, assuring them the oil
spill would not affect their travel plans.
   Before the spill, Alaska tourism officials predicted just over
780,000 people would visit the state this season, its 30th
anniversary of statehood. That would have been up from 709,664 in
1988 and would match 1986, the best year ever, when a number of
visitors to British Columbia's Expo 86 world's fair included Alaska
in their tours.
   Some visitors may be drawn to Alaska because of publicity about
the spill and the environmental damage it wrought, officials said.
   Some entrepreneurs may even arrange tours of oil-fouled areas,
Dow predicted.
   ``I think it's probably correct to say we're getting people up
there who want to see the oil spill,'' Cowper said. But, he added,
``they're going to have a hard time.''

<HEAD>Eds: SUBs 3rd graf pvs, CNW stock...to UPDATE with closing price.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   CNW Corp.'s board approved a $1.6 billion buyout
offer Tuesday from a group that includes company management,
railroad company Union Pacific Corp. and other investors, prompting
hostile suitor Japonica Partners to withdraw its own offer.
   The buyout group formed by investment banker Blackstone Group,
which will hold a controlling interest in the railroad company,
agreed to pay $45.50 cash per common share in cash and $4.50 per
share of preferred stock.
   CNW stock jumped 75 cents to close at $47.50 a share New York
Stock Exchange composite trading.
   ``Employees and customers of CNW will benefit from the fact that
our business plan calls for upgrading CNW's most strategically
important line, does not depend upon the sale of operating assets,
and continues CNW's role as a provider of quality transportation
services,'' said CNW chairman and chief executive officer Robert
Schmiege, who leads the management contingent of the buyout group.
   New York-based Japonica Partners, which had been pursuing a $44 a
share hostile takeover valued at $722 million, issued a statement
saying it was terminating its tender offer. The group is CNW's
largest shareholder with an 8.8 percent stake.
   ``Japonica Partners and its affiliates intend to evaluate their
alternatives, which may include the disposition of some or all of
the CNW common shares benefically owned by them; or holding some or
all of such shares for sale pursuant to the merger agreement,'' the
statement read.
   Based on approximately 19 million CNW shares outstanding and the
assumption of CNW debt, the management group valued its buyout plan
at $1.6 billion.
   New York's Chemical Bank has committed $585 million in buyout
financing and the New York investment firm Donaldson, Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette Inc. has committed to provide up to $475 million in
financing.
   Blackstone will hold a controlling interest in CNW under the
agreement, with minority positions held by management and Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette.
   Union Pacific, the railroad and trucking company, will hold $100
million of stock that will be convertible into a minority position
after five years.
   Officials said Blackstone's financing structure will not require
significant sales of operating assets to retire the debt caused by
the takeover. But the firm will complete CNW's previously announced
plan to sell its Chicago-area commuter operations and will divest
some real estate and surplus equipment.
   Japonica planned to sell CNW's real estate, excess equipment and
Chicago-area commuter lines if its takeover bid succeeded.
   CNW is the parent of the Chicago and North Western Transportation
Co., a 6,000-mile railroad with 8,500 employees that operates in
nine states, most of them in the Midwest.
   Union Pacific owns Bethlehem, Pa.-based Union Pacific Railroad.
which has some 21,000 route miles, all west of the Mississippi River.
   Union Pacific relies heavily on the North Western's
Chicago-to-Fremont, Neb., line for east-west freight traffic and
accounts for about 40 percent of the North Western's shipments,
analysts say.
   ``We wanted to insure reliable and effective service to our
customers into and out of Chicago,'' Union Pacific spokesman Harvey
Turner said of the takeover agreement in a telephone interview.
   CNW has agreed with Union Pacific to spend $115 million through
1992 to maintain and upgrade CNW's east-west main line in order to
improve rail quality and shorten delivery times.
   Union Pacific recently paid $1.5 million for an option to buy the
Iowa Interstate Railroad, a regional line between Iowa and Chicago.
Officials said the line would have served as a substitute for the
North Western had a hostile takeover disrupted freight service.
   The offer by the Blackstone-led group was approved by a special
CNW board committee that was evaluating bids for the Chicago-based
rail company.
   CNW's union on Friday made a proposal to buy the company that
would have given employees a one-third stake in the railroad. Union
officials did not immedately return telephone calls seeking comment.

<HEAD>Precious Metals Show First Gains in Months</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Demand for precious metals increased Tuesday because of the
turmoil in China, driving up the price of gold and silver on New
York's Commodity Exchange.
   On other markets, cotton prices continued their slide, grain and
soybean futures fell, livestock and pork prices declined and energy
futures were lower.
   After about three months of declining prices, gold and silver
posted a solid gain as demand for the metal increased in the
aftermath of China's domestic troubles.
   Gold prices settled $12.40 to $13.60 higher with the contract for
delivery in June at $379.90 a troy ounce; silver was 16.7 cents to
19.5 cents higher with June at $5.431 a troy ounce.
   ``This is the first meaningful rally in the past three or four
months,'' said Peter Cardillo, an analyst with Josephthal &amp; Co. in
New York. ``A lot of people in Hong Kong have been sellers of gold
and purchasers of dollars. That has stopped, causing the market to
react positively.''
   Investors often turn to gold and silver, which are looked upon as
more stable investments, as a hedge in times of turmoil.
   Another factor in the buying of precious metals was the
recommendation by the United States that its citizens leave China,
and a slight decline Tuesday in the value of the U.S. dollar,
Cardillo said.
   Cotton prices continued their downward spiral that began Monday
on New York's Cotton Exchange.
   Ed Whitten, an analyst with Balfour Maclaine Corp. in New York
said there is concern the Chinese may cancel orders already made for
cotton.
   ``U.S. shippers are reluctant to ship for fear the cotton will be
floating around at sea without a destination,'' he said.``And even
it it arrives in Shanghai, it may not get unloaded.''
   China is a major buyer of cotton, despite being one of the
world's major producers.
   Cotton was 1.45 cents to 2 cents lower with July at 63.83 cents a
pound.
   Grain and soybean futures prices were lower on the Chicago Board
of Trade, with wheat prices falling despite announcement of a major
sale to China. Monday's announcement of the sale of 1.85 million
metric tons of wheat was expected to be a boost to wheat prices, but
that did not occur.
   Corn prices were mostly lower on news that Egypt and Turkey
bought French maize rather than U.S. corn, and on the lack of
confirmation of sales of U.S. corn to the Soviet Union.
   However, after the markets closed Tuesday the U.S. Agriculture
Department announced the sale of 300,000 metric tons of corn to the
Soviets.
   Soybean prices fell as investors purchased old crop futures and
sold new crop.
   Wheat settled 3 cents to 6{ cents lower with the contract for
delivery in July at $3.88\ a bushel; corn was 3{ cents lower to 2{
cents higher with July at $2.61\ a bushel; oats were 5 cents to 6{
cents lower with July at $1.62{ a bushel; soybeans were 3} cents
lower to 8{ cents higher with July at $7.14 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were lower on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, with with pork prices lower on USDA reports of increased
marketing and high cold storage figures.
   Cattle prices dropped in a carryover from hog prices and weak
cash prices.
   Live cattle were .15 cent to .70 cent lower with June at 68.82
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .22 cent lower to .10 cent higher
wtih August at 78.85 cents a pound; hogs were .27 cent lower to .67
cent lower with June at 48.15 a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.83
cents to 2 cents lower with July at 30.45 cents a pound.
   Energy futures prices weakened on the New York Mercantile
Exchange as OPEC ministers meeting in Vienna struggled to agree on
allotting a proposed cartel-wide oil production increase among its
13 member nations.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 2 cents to 19 cents lower
with July at $20.46 a barrel; heating oil was .78 cent to .91 cent
lower with July at 51 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .15 cent
lower to .10 cent higher with July at 64.94 cents a gallon.

<HEAD>Nintendo Intends to Become Information Supplier in U.S.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Nintendo Co. is developing a plan that could use the machines
that run its popular video games as part of a network for delivering
information to U.S. households, a spokeswoman for the company said
Tuesday.
   The plan apparently would transform Nintendo Entertainment System
units into inexpensive home computers providing a range of news,
possibly about stock markets, travel and other topics.
   The units are plastic boxes, retailing for around $100, that hook
up to television sets to display such hit Nintendo games as ``Super
Mario Brothers 2,'' ``Zelda II,'' and ``Mike Tyson's Punch-out.''
   The company has held discussions with American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co. to explore the technological possibilities of having
Nintendo devices form part of an information delivery network,
according to the spokeswoman, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Nintendo intends to pursue the concept and hopes to work out the
mechanics of a plan by next year. No formal arrangements have been
made with AT&amp;T or any other company, the spokeswoman said.
   AT&amp;T confirmed in a brief news release that it was discussing a
number of possibilities with Nintendo. However, it stated that ``no
business relationship has been agreed upon and no contracts have
been signed.''
   The announcement was issued in response to published reports that
indicated Nintendo and AT&amp;T had joined forces to set up an
information supplying network.
   Peter Main, vice president of marketing for Nintendo Co., the
American subsidiary of the Kyoto, Japan-based Nintendo Co. Ltd.,
wouldn't elaborate on the plan in an article published Tuesday in
the Wall Street Journal. He also declined to identify what company
might provide the database information.
   Main was said to be traveling Tuesday and unavailable for comment.
   Fuller details about Nintendo's strategy are to be revealed
Wednesday when company executives meet with securities analysts in
New York, the company spokeswoman said.
   Nintendo's Japanese parent company already delivers an assortment
of information over its ``Family Computer'' devices in Japanese
households.

<HEAD>Third World Falling Behind on $70 Billion Owed US Banks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Third World countries are falling behind on
$70.67 billion worth of debt to U.S. banks, according to the General
Accounting Office.
   The GAO, which reports investigations to Congress, did not name
the countries. Argentina, the number three debtor after Brazil and
Mexico, has paid no interest on its foreign debt for over a year.
   The GAO said U.S. bank regulators should make banks put up more
reserves to protect their depositors against losses on those loans.
   It calculated that the regulators now demand reserves of only 5.1
percent, about $3.6 billion. It suggested that they should be
insisting on 62.2 percent, nearly $44 billion.
   ``Because banks generally respond to reserve requirements by
writing down assets by the required amounts, a decline in ther book
value of their assets results,'' the office said in a recent note on
figures to Rep. John J. LaFalce, a member of the Banking Committee.
   Though the GAO did not say so, writing down a bank's assets
reduces the amount of business it can do and makes the management
look bad to depositors and stockholders.
   In a letter Tuesday to Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan,
LaFalce said the banks should put up more reserves. ``U.S. banks
maintain lower reserve levels than almost all other industrialized
countries,'' LaFalce wrote.
   A bank is now only required to put up reserves when the
regulators declare foreign loans it has made to be either a total
loss or ``value-impaired.'' That means the debtors have not paid
interest for six months or otherwise shown that they are in deep
trouble.
   U.S. bank regulators next week are expected to discuss behind
closed doors whether to classify loans to Argentina as
``value-impaired.''
   The category already contains Poland, Bolivia, Peru, Zaire,
Sudan, Nicaragua and Liberia. But their total debt is small compared
with the major debtors Brazil, Mexico and Argentina.
   U.S. authorities calculate that Argentina owes U.S. banks more
than $8.5 billion. Argentina has not paid interest for more than a
year on its foreign debt, now estimated at over $60 billion.
   The GAO thinks that the bank regulators should insist that the
crediotr banks put aside reserves proportional to the price that a
country's debt will fetch on the open market.

<HEAD>Petition Drive Launched to Keep Jeep in Toledo</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MITCH WEISS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials launched a petition drive Tuesday
to keep Chrysler Corp.'s Jeep plant in Toledo after a contract
between the United Auto Workers and Chrysler expires in 1992.
   Democratic City Council candidate Carty Finkbeiner, who is
leading the drive, said volunteers will try to collect 200,000
signatures from people asking Chrysler to keep the plant open.
   Local labor leaders are helping to organize the petition drive.
   Finkbeinder said ``a convoy of Jeeps'' will travel to Chrysler in
Detroit in the fall to deliver the petitions with the message:
``Manufacturing is not dead in Toledo. Long live manufacturing in
Toledo. Long live Jeep.''
   Some automotive industry analysts predict Chrysler will close the
Jeep plant when the current contract expires or in the mid-1990s,
when production of a new generation of Jeeps begins at the company's
new Detroit plant.
   Chrysler has said it will continue to produce the Jeep Cherokee,
which dominates the sport utility market, at the Toledo plant as
long as it continues to sell.
   Company officials also have said they will negotiate a new
contract with UAW Local 12 when the current accord expires.
   ``As far as Chrysler is concerned, the petition drive isn't
necessary because we have that agreement until 1992, which is a long
time in the auto industry,'' Chrysler spokesman Doug Nicholl said.

<HEAD>Private LBO Firm Backs $1.8 Billion Buyout Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A previously announced $1.8 billion
buyout bid for American Medical International Inc. is backed by the
New York leveraged buyout firm Clayton &amp; Dubilier Inc., it was
revealed Monday.
   The friendly offer for the hospital company, organized by
minority shareholder Dr. M. Lee Pearce of Miami, is valued by the
offerer at $24 a share. Of that, $21 a share is cash and the rest
in securities.
   Clayton &amp; Dubilier, a private firm that financed the $960
million management buyout of Colgate Palmolive Co.'s Kendall Co. in
October, leads the buyout group, according to AMI.
   A special committee of the company's board is studying the
offer, AMI said in a news release.
   The potential buyers set a June 15 deadline, and indicated they
were willing to negotiate for a higher price, AMI said.
   Pearce, one of several shareholders who have been pressing the
company to boost its earnings and stock price, first offered to buy
the company in March. Then he valued the offer at $24 a share and
said the portion of that to be in the form of securities would
range from $2 a share to $4 a share.
   American Medical owns 75 hospitals in the United States and
overseas.
   The emergence of Clayton &amp; Dubilier eases doubts about the
seriousness of the offer, said Rae Alperstein, who follows the
company for the Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards investment firm in
Los Angeles.
   ``The investment community was concerned about whether Pearce
was serious and whether he could get the financing,'' Ms.
Alperstein said. ``I think what this says is a deal is going to get
done.''

<HEAD>Economist: One-Third of Thrift Industry Can't Meet Capital Requirements</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 6 grafs to UPDATE with Wall comments.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional efforts to force the
nation's thrifts to meet stringent capital requirements would push
almost one-third of the industry into insolvency and keep home
mortgage rates above 10 percent, the chief economist for a trade
association said Tuesday.
   James Christian, director of the economics department for the
U.S. League of Savings Institutions, told Texas thrift executives
that as many as 973 thrifts, with $768 billion in assets, would fail
to meet requirements that they maintain 3 percent tangible capital.
   The industry has been pushing for capital requirements, which
either include ``goodwill'' _ the amount of net worth above the
value of tangible assets _ or a several-year period to transform the
goodwill into money.
   Opponents have objected to including goodwill because it is
intangible.
   Speaking at the 1989 Texas Savings and Loan League convention,
Christian said many lawmakers apparently feel ``more is better and
tougher is what they want to do,'' but he said it is a mistake ``if
you have to kill a third of the industry in order to get this done
the day after tomorrow.''
   Christian said more stringent capital requirements would force
institutions to shrink, causing them to sell off mortgages, which in
turn would tighten the market and keep interest rates high. He
predicted home mortgage rates will average 11 percent this year,
falling only slightly to 10.6 percent by 1991.
   But Christian said the 2,000 remaining thrifts that would not be
affected by the more stringent requirements ``are plain vanilla
housing lenders for the most part, always have been.''
   Critics have blamed much of the industry's problems on savings
and loans that strayed too far from their roots as home lenders.
   This year alone regulators have placed more than 200 thrifts
under their control awaiting passage of legislation that would
provide more than $157 billion over the next 10 years to rescue the
industry.
   The U.S. House favors the more stringent capital requirements,
but the legislation is not expected to come up for a floor vote
before next week as the House Rules Committee sifts through more
than 100 amendments.
   In other forecasts, Christian said the current business
expansion, already the nation's longest during peacetime, could
continue at moderate levels for up to two years. But for that to
happen, he said, the Federal Reserve system must stop worrying about
inflation.
   Until recently, the Fed has been pushing up interest rates to
keep inflation under control. But Christian said world markets are
forcing the Fed to rethink that strategy through the strength of the
dollar.
   Christian said the inflation rate will rise to 4.8 percent this
year before falling to 4.0 percent by 1991.
   Later, M. Danny Wall, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board, told the group that figures to be released Wednesday indicate
the evaporation of deposits from the nation's thrifts continued to
decline in April, a traditionally down month as taxpayers pay Uncle
Sam.
   In April 1988, thrift deposits grew by $1.2 billion as investors
shifted money from uncertain stock and mutual fund investments. So
far this year, however, $28.5 billion has been withdrawn from
thrifts, including a record $10.8 billion in January.
   Wall also said that a secret survey by the bank board found some
Southwest Plan thrifts not doing enough to sell distressed real
estate.
   Most federal regulators who have visited Texas in recent months
have taken pains to reassure local officials that the government
will not dump on the market properties acquired through the rescue
of hundreds of savings and loans and banks.
   But Wall told reporters Tuesday the bank board had sent
``shoppers'' into Texas and discovered that some of the properties
held by institutions recapitalized last year through the Southwest
Plan had not even been listed for sale.
   Wall suggested that the Southwest Plan thrifts _ which were
created last year through the consolidation and sale of ailing
institutions _ may have taken the ``no dumping'' promise too
literally.

<HEAD>Prime Drops Court Appeal Against MAI Basic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Computer Inc. has dropped its appeal to the
1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals seeking to enjoin MAI Basic Four
Inc.'s unsolicited takeover bid because MAI's recent revision of its
offer made the appeal irrelevant.
   ``It no longer made sense to pursue that deal,'' Prime spokesman
Joseph Gavaghan said Tuesday.
   Gavaghan said MAI's offer of $19.50 cash per share would actually
be $14.80 per share on a fully diluted basis and ``does not reflect
the intrinsic value of the company.'' Prime is encouraging
stockholders to resist MAI's offer, he said.
   Prime's board of directors postponed the company's annual
stockholders meeting from June 14 to July 26 to ``provide for an
orderly, active and effective exploration of all financial
alternatives,'' officials said in a statement Tuesday.
   Prime's board has said it is discussing acquisition possibilities
with interested parties and is contemplating a possible
recapitalization.
   On Monday, MAI officials said Prime's consideration of other
takeover offers was a ``a deliberate attempt to confuse Prime
stockholders.''
   Last Thursday, MAI lowered its tender offer 50 cents a share
because of Prime's projected results in 1989 and 1990.
   MAI, which is about one-fourth the size of Prime, which is based
in the Boston suburb of Natick, owns about 1.2 million shares of
Prime stock. Since it launched its hostile bid in November, 33.3
million shares were tendered under the $20 offer, representing
nearly 70 percent of the outstanding shares and just under 50
percent of Prime's stock on a fully diluted basis.
   Gavaghan said Prime's executive council has agreed to meet with
MAI Chairman Bennett LeBow at an unspecified future date.
