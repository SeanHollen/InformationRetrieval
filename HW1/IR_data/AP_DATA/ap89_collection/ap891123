   Three people were missing from a
private, single-engine plane that crashed into the Gulf of Mexico
Wednesday night, Coast Guard officials said.
   The Cessna 210 with four people aboard went down about 30 miles
south of Palacios at 8:27 p.m. while en route from Brownsville to
Houston, said Petty Officer Steve Guy at Coast Guard district
headquarters in New Orleans.
   A man who was in the plane swam to a nearby oil platform and was
talking by cellular telephone to a Coast Guard duty officer in
Galveston, said Petty Officer Clifton Vigus in Corpus Christi. The
Coast Guard was trying to pinpoint the location of the platform and
rescue craft had been dispatched.
   The other three people were unaccounted for, Vigus said.
   Palacios is a coastal community about halfway between Corpus
Christi and Galveston.

   The space shuttle Discovery's fiery
Thanksgiving eve ascent lit up the night sky, providing a
spectacular view over a large portion of Florida, but cloud cover
obscured the visibility for the rest of the Southeast.
   ``It was 100 times brighter than a star,'' said Glenna Milberg,
a producer-reporter at WSVN-TV in Miami, 200 miles to the south.
``It was a real pretty orange against the blue, black sky.''
   ``It looked like a Roman candle,'' over the city's Biscayne Bay,
she said.
   The captain of the cruise ship Mardi Gras, at sea close to
Freeport in the Bahamas, described the liftoff as ``like lightning
on the horizon.''
   First came the bright light, Capt. Angelo Sornari said in a
telep;hone call to the Associated Press, ``then the line of fire
that rose up.''
   He said he could see the shuttle tail of fire for 1{ to two
minutes from the bridge.
   As the shuttle roared toward the heavens, people at the launch
site could see it for more than 600 miles.
   ``It was gorgeous. It was a bright, bright orangey sky,'' said
Dorothy Flores of Winter Park.
   Tampa Tribune editor Ecton Theriot, watching from 150 miles
away, described the fire ball visible from the Gulf Coast as
``about the width of a full moon.''
   ``I thought it was pretty impressive that it was as bright as it
was considering the distance,'' he said.
   The last night launch was of the space shuttle Atlantis on Nov.
26, 1985, when its bright orange tail could be seen to the west in
Tampa and St. Petersburg, south to Key West and north to
Charleston, S.C., about 300 miles north of Cape Canaveral.
   Clouds prevented such a view Wednesday.
   Viewers in Jacksonville, about 150 miles north of Cape
Canaveral, also were disappointed.
   ``It was too cloudy. Everyone ran out to the parking lot, but we
couldn't see a thing,'' said Francis X. Donnelly, a reporter for
The Florida Times-Union.
   In nearby Titusville, Wednesday night church services were
halted as parishoners poured out of the buildings to watch the
liftoff. An estimated 40,000 to 50,000 visitors watched the rising
fireball, said Jerry Eads, assistant Titusville police chief.

<HEAD>Auction Sets Record For Music Manuscript</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A winning bid of more than $1 million for a single
Robert Schumann music manuscript at auction has broken all previous
price records in the category, Sotheby's said.
   Albi Rosenthal, a book dealer and amateur violin player from
Oxford, paid $1.4 million on Wednesday for a single manuscript of
the German composer's only finished piano concerto.
   Rosenthal said he had been willing to go 30 percent higher to
outbid his two rivals.
   ``Everybody who is, like me, a musician or interested in music
knows this work almost inside out,'' Rosenthal said. ``It's one of
the most famous piano concertos. It's been played from Alaska to
Zanzibar.''
   Rosenthal, who has played the piece with Oxford University's
orchestra, said the manuscript would be sent to a library in
Germany and would be available to music scholars.
   Schumann began writing the concerto in 1841 for his wife Clara
Wieck, a piano virtuoso, who first performed it four years later in
Dresden.
   The manuscript has not been available to scholars since 1912
when it was sold after the death of Schumann's daughter, Marie.
   Sotheby's said it was sent to London for sale from an unnamed
private European collection.
   The previous record for a single music manuscript before
Wednesday's sale was $520,000 paid for Stravinsky's Rite of Spring.
   That record was broken at the start of Wednesday's auction when
an anonymous bidder paid $686,000 for the manuscript of a Bach
cantata.

<HEAD>Flag Carrier Ordered to Suspend Flight Service to Tripoli</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Korean Air has been ordered to suspend
its flight service to Tripoli for two months in connection with the
July crash of one of its DC-10s in the Libyan capital, the
government said today.
   Officials said the action followed the Transport Ministry's
conclusion after months of investigation that pilot error caused
the crash, in which 74 people aboard and six on the ground were
killed.
   They said the suspension order, effective Jan. 1, was final and
irrevocable and that the South Korean flag carrier had accepted the
order.
   The Seoul-Tripoli route via Saudi Arabia's Jiddah was opened in
1981 mainly to carry South Korean construction workers to and from
Africa and the Middle East, where South Korean contractors are
engaged in many projects.
   KAL officials declined to discuss business losses from the
two-month suspension of the once-a-week flight service.
   The ministry revoked the licenses of the plane's pilot, co-pilot
and flight engineer and filed a criminal complaint with government
prosecutors against the three, ministry officials said. The three
survived the crash.
   They said the flight crew could face murder and negligence
charges if the criminal inquiry concludes they were at fault.
   The Koreran Air jetliner reportedly crashed short of the runway
while attempting to land at the fog-shrouded Tripoli Airport.

<HEAD>Poll Shows Favorable Attitude Toward Soviet Union</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   More Americans now believe the Soviet Union is
a force for peace than a threat to peace, and most believe the Cold
War is ending, according to a new poll.
   Results of a random sample of 1,007 adults in The Washington
Post-ABC News poll reported in Thursday editions of the newspaper
showed 46 percent responding that the Soviet Union is more a force
for peace than it is a threat, while 38 percent answered in the
reverse.
   When the same question was asked in 1983, 90 percent said the
Soviet Union was more of a threat to peace.
   Fifty-eight percent of respondents in the latest survey thought
the cold war is coming to an end _ 64 percent of the men and but
only 52 percent of the women.
   The sample divided, though, over whether this meant the
possibility of major reductions in defense spending without harm to
national security: 50 percent said yes, 45 percent said no.
   Though the report did not give a margin for error, a standard
statistical calculation shows it is likely to be slightly more than
plus or minus three percentage points.
   A ``big majority'' was said to favor aid to Poland, Hungary and
East Germany, though no figure was given and ``seven in 10''
favored the reunification of Germany.
   Of several possible reasons for the decline of communism, about
six out of 10 said the fact that the ``Soviet system was not
working'' was a major reason, and 43 percent said it was the single
most important reason.
   Slightly less than a third said the tough anti-Soviet policies
of the Reagan administration were a major reason for changes in the
Soviet bloc, and only 14 percent believe the changes are coming
about because Reagan ``forced them to change.''

   Activist-actor Martin Sheen was among 65
demonstrators and clergymen arrested Thanksgiving eve for blocking
the entrance to the downtown federal building during a protest of
U.S. policy in El Salvador.
   Archbishop Roger Mahony, the Rev. Luis Olivares and Bishop
Frederich Borsch were among the 200 demonstrators who took part in
the two-hour morning protest in the Los Angeles Civic Center.
   All but one were arrested for trespassing on federal property,
the Federal Protective Service reported. The 65th was arrested for
taking down yellow tape police lines. All were cited and released.
   Nine demonstrators lay down at the building's entrance and were
covered with sheets splattered in red paint.
   The protests coincide with heavy fighting in San Salvador,
including the takeover by leftist rebels of part of a luxury hotel
in San Salvador, trapping U.S. soldiers. The rebels apparently
slipped away during the night, and the Americans escaped unharmed.
   The demonstrators' anger focused onlast week's killings of six
Jesuit priests, slayings the protesters blame on rightists allied
with the Salvadoran military.
   Mahony, who joined the demonstration in prayer but didn't
participate in the civil disobedience, told the protesters he was
flying to the civil war-torn El Salvador on Saturday to help
deliver medical supplies and food.

   A convenience store worker was
arrested after telling police he was addicted to the lottery and
stole money from his employer to buy about 50 tickets to Florida's
games each day, police said.
   Robert Kempton of Tamarac is accused of faking three robberies
at the Farm Store where he worked and stealing a total of $4,000,
police spokeswoman Linda Zohman said.
   Kempton, 20, filed police reports in October, September and May,
saying the store was robbed and that he once was knocked
unconscious, Zohman said.
   Police became suspicious of the number of robberies at one
business, and Kempton confessed to the thefts on Tuesday while he
was questioned, she said.
   Police charged Kempton with three counts of grand theft and
three counts of filing a false police report. Zohman said Kempton
had no previous criminal record.
   Florida's Lottery spokesman Ed George said game officials did
not monitor reports of gambling addiction problems. ``That is not
something we would hear about,'' he said. ``Our goal is to sell
tickets to raise money for education.''

   Homer Stratton doesn't forget his debts.
It just takes him a few decades to repay them.
   The 67-year-old Army veteran borrowed $50 from Phil Porreca when
they were both stationed in the Philippines in 1945. Stratton
needed the loan because he had lost his money playing poker.
   After the war, Stratton lost track of Porreca and settled in
Waterloo, about 50 miles west of Syracuse.
   The unpaid debt ``bothered me off and on over the years,'' he
said. ``Phil was the only person I owed a debt to.''
   About four years ago, Stratton learned from a wartime friend
that Porreca was living in Lima, Ohio. Stratton wrote letters to
Porreca for three years, but never got a response.
   Recently, Stratton went to Lima in person.
   ``I planned to stay until I found Phil,'' he said. ``I wasn't
going to leave without paying him the money.''
   Stratton called the house and Porreca's wife answered. She
invited him over and when he arrived, Porreca was standing in the
driveway waiting for him.
   ``We shook hands and he told me he recognized me right away,''
Stratton said. ``I asked him if there was anything he remembered
about me. Phil grinned and said, `Yeah, I left $50 with you.'''
   Stratton handed Porreca a new $50 bill and Porreca treated
Stratton to a steak dinner.
   ``He was a super fellow,'' Stratton said. ``I told him not to
get any ideas about making me pay interest because I wasn't going
to give any.''

<HEAD>Syndicated ``USA Today On TV'' Cancelled</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``USA Today On TV,'' begun a little more than a
year ago with high-tech graphics as a video cousin of the USA Today
newspaper, has been cancelled.
   The program's 150 staffers learned on Wednesday that the
low-rated syndicated weekday series and its one-hour weekend
edition, created at a cost of $40 million, will have its final
broadcast Jan. 8. The cancellation was expected.
   The series was seen on 156 stations when it made its premiere as
``USA Today: The Television Show'' on Sept. 12, 1988. It had four
anchors, a brisk pace, and a busy assortment of flashy graphics
then.
   Asssailed by many TV critics for what they called its flash and
lack of substance, the half-hour weekday show saw its ratings
steadily decline. And only 84 stations carried it by the time of
its cancellation.
   The show now has two anchors, Bill Macatee and Beth Ruyak, who
co-anchors the show's one-hour weekend edition with Boyd Matson.
   Since its debut, the series has undergone several format
changes, gotten a more traditional look and its current name, and
had four different executives running it.
   Originating from Rosslyn, Va., near Washington, the show was
created by Steve Friedman, its first executive producer and the
former executive producer of NBC's top-rated ``Today'' show.
   The syndicated series is produced by GTG East, part of Culver
City, Calif.-based GTG Entertainment. The company is a co-venture
of the Gannett Co. and former NBC Chairman Grant Tinker.
   In a statement announcing the series' end, Tinker and John
Curley, Gannett's chairman and president, said, ``While we're
obviously disappointed that `USA Today On TV' didn't attract a
wider audience, we're proud of the program's quality and
journalistic standards.''
   In its first week, the show and its weekend edition had an 8.1
rating. In the latest available A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings, the
weekday version of the show averaged a 2.9 rating. Each ratings
point represents 921,000 homes.
   ``USA Today On TV,'' in a category that TV executives call
``reality'' programming, was the second such syndicated series to
be cancelled this season. The first was Orion Entertainment's
``Crimewatch Tonight.''

<TEXT>
   U.S. Army Green Berets sprinted
across the pool deck of a luxury hotel to freedom Wednesday, ending
a 28-hour siege that began when leftist guerrillas seized the
building in their latest offensive.
   Late Wednesday, the rebels reiterated that they were willing to
participate in a cease-fire in fighting that began 11 days earlier,
providing the first steps toward fundmental political, social and
economic reform be made. They also demanded international
verification.
   There was no immediate reaction from El Salvador's right-wing
government.
   On Wednesday morning, the U.S. soldiers, carrying their luggage,
rifles and grenades, ran from the hotel when the rebels apparently
abandoned it. Waiting police pickup trucks then sped off with them
inside.
   The raid on the El Salvador Sheraton Hotel began before dawn
Tuesday as part of a larger attack on the capital's wealthiest
neighborhood. Numerous foreign guests, including the chief of the
Organization of American States, were evacuated, but the Green
Berets remained until Wednesday morning.
   President Bush said Wednesday an elite Army unit ``liberated the
hotel,'' but the administration said later the special unit never
entered the building.
   Reporters who spent the morning with the soldiers saw no special
operation, although security was heavy around the hotel and
included a few U.S. soldiers.
   U.S. Ambassador William Walker said 12 Green Berets and three
civilians were trapped inside the hotel overnight.
   The El Salvador Sheraton is not now part of the U.S.-based chain.
   Union chief Felix Blanco, secretary-general of the 40,000
Salvadoran Worker's Central, asked the nation's guerrillas on
Wednesday to ``forget the armed struggle,'' saying the war impeded
economic progress for the common people.
   Blanco spoke in Caracas, Venezuela, where he was attending a
world labor conference and where President Carlos Andres Perez was
preparing to meet Salvadoran guerrilla leaders on Thursday to try
to stop the fighting.
   Perez has scheduled talks with representatives of the Farabundo
Marti National Liberation Front, or FMLN, the coalition of
guerrilla armies in El Salvador.
   The FMLN late Wednesday expressed its ``immediate acceptance''
of a truce that, if agreed, would be monitored by U.N.
peacekeepers. The communique was mainly a reiteration of the
rebels' negotiating position during two sessions of peace talks
earlier this year that had ended in deadlock.
   However, it also indicated that the rebels renewed their demand
to negotiate directly with the armed forces. They had earlier given
up their insistence of an armed forces presence on the government
delegation, saying the move was a concession indicating flexibility.
   The Green Berets told reporters before leaving that they never
considered themselves hostages, although they barricaded themselves
behind mattresses. They said they never exchanged fire with the
guerrillas.
   Walker and Bush said the Salvadoran government negotiated for
the soldiers' release, but the Green Berets said most of the rebel
assault force simply walked out of the building at dusk Tuesday.
   The hotel facade was sprayed with thousands of bullets. Two
Salvadoran bodyguards of OAS chief Joao Baena Soares were killed.
   ``We're all OK. We got some sleep during the night, but there
was sporadic firing,'' said one U.S. soldier.
   All the guerrillas had abandoned the building by dawn, although
isolated shots indicated a lone rebel sniper may have remained in
the area after daybreak.
   The soldiers, dressed in sneakers, jeans and sport shirts or
T-shirts, waited three more hours to make their dash.
   The Green Berets declined to give their names but confirmed they
were from Fort Bragg, N.C., and were in El Salvador on a 13-day
training mission.
   U.S. advisers who spend less than two weeks here are not counted
in the 55-trooper limit on military advisers set by Congress.
   The raid was the latest act of an 11-day offensive by the FMLN.
The day broke without heavy gunfire or air attacks for the first
time since Nov. 11. At least 1,000 people have been killed in the
offensive.
   Guerrilla chiefs said Tuesday in Escalon the objective was to
take control of the zone around the hotel as a demonstration of
strength to Baena Soares, who was in El Salvador on a peace mission.
   The guerrilla assault began at 4 a.m. (5 a.m. EST) Tuesday when
at least 100 rebels entered the western neighborhood of Escalon.
   They established tentative control around the Sheraton, but
government troops backed by tanks surrounded the area.
   That frustrated a guerrilla plan for Facundo Guardado, a top
rebel army leader, to meet personally with Baena Soares, guerrilla
leaders said.
   Baena Soares, a Brazilian, was trapped for hours before being
evacuated by an armored personnel carrier. He then flew to
Washington.
   The guerrilla action _ besides bringing the war to the front
doors of the rich and partially destroying a four-star hotel _
appeared to achieve little.
   The capital was almost completely quiet Wednesday and reports of
calm from the provinces indicated the Escalon assault might have
been the offensive's last gasp.
   Gregorio Rosa Chavez, the auxiliary Roman Catholic bishop of San
Salvador, said a church delegation would meet with President
Alfredo Cristiani and with guerrillas in mediation efforts.
   More than 71,000 people, mostly civilians, have died in the
civil war.

   It was a real Mickey Mouse election this
year in Buffalo.
   The cartoon character picked up seven votes in the Nov. 7
election for mayor, according to Erie County Board of Election
workers who were tallying the final write-in votes this week.
   Mickey also got votes in other races, including city Common
Council, Erie County Leglislature, Buffalo City Court and Family
Court.
   Also gathering votes in the mayoral race were fellow Disney
characters Donald Duck and Goofy, as well as Daffy Duck, Pee Wee
Herman, Bullwinkle the Moose and Bill the Cat, a character from the
former cartoon strip ``Bloom County.''
   None garnered enough votes to deny incumbent Mayor James D.
Griffin another term, though. Griffin rolled to an easy victory
with the backing of the Democratic, Republican, Conservative and
Right to Life parties.
   The fact that he had no real opposition apparently accounted for
an unusually high number of frivolous write-in votes, election
officials said.
   Deadhead, a radio persona adopted by local disc jockey Danny
Neaverth, gathered 82 write-in votes for mayor. Everybody else
gathered two votes.
   Three voters wrote in Judge Joseph Wapner of television's
``People's Court'' for city judge.
   Even Zsa Zsa Gabor got one write-in vote _ for county sheriff.
Sheriff Thomas Higgins ran unopposed.
   The jokes were lost on Deputy Elections Commissioner Theodore
Filosofos, who mentioned that two recent races were decided by one
vote.
   ``We spend about $4 million a year in this office to register
everyone, keep track of their addresses and polling places and
record their votes,'' he said. ``They think it's a joke. They
squander their vote. These votes are just wasted. We don't count
them.''

   Charlton Heston helped dish up an early
Thanksgiving dinner to thousands of homeless people at a mission on
Los Angeles' Skid Row.
   Earl Holliman of the 1970s TV drama ``Police Woman'' and Laraine
Newman of the original ``Saturday Night Live'' cast joined Heston
and about 400 other volunteers in serving dinners on a blocked-off
street Wednesday.
   ``I've come down here for four years, but I don't enjoy the fact
that this has to be here,'' Holliman said.
   The volunteers served more than 5,000 meals of rolled turkey
slices, cranberry sauce, mashed potatoes and gravy, vegetables and
pumpkin pie.
   Singers belted out religious songs as the homeless took turns
eating at rows of tables decorated with turkeys made from apples.
   Larry Shelton said he walked about 10 miles for the free meal.
   ``It's nice service,'' he said. ``But I would rather not have to
wait in line since 8 a.m. to eat cold food. I'd rather have a
home.''

   Sting says he's glad he decided to leave the
security and fame of the rock world to play the role of Macheath in
``3 Penny Opera'' on Broadway.
   ``If I listened to the critics, I'd be off in a little room
somewhere, cowering in a corner,'' the singer said in an interview
in the latest issue of Gentleman's Quarterly.
   ``I've been rewarded in the past for singing in my own way,
singing in my own words, dancing and behaving as I am. The people
who are running this show aren't interested in the least in how I
do that,'' he said.
   ``Now, perverse as this sounds, I'm actually enjoying it,'' he
said. ``It's a discipline, wearing a straightjacket for a while,
and it's a discipline I will learn from.''

   Frank Sinatra dealt a blow to a musicians'
union by saying he would cross picket lines to perform next month
at Bally's resort.
   Sinatra, who refused to cross picket lines for earlier shows,
said in a statement Wednesday he would appear at engagements at
Bally's scheduled for Dec. 4-9 and Dec. 26-31.
   ``The holiday season is here and it's time for everyone to get
back to work,'' Sinatra said.
   Musicians Local 369 has been on strike against Bally's and four
other resorts since the summer over the use of taped music and
guaranteed work weeks.
   Sinatra's decision is the latest sign that support for the union
is diminishing. Several other performers, including Wayne Newton,
the Pointer Sisters, Bill Cosby and Joan Rivers, have crossed the
lines in recent months.
   Singer Barbara Mandrell and comedian George Carlin, who
previously honored the strike, have announced plans to perform this
weekend at Bally's and Caesars Palace.
   Union leader Mark Tully Massagli said he was disappointed by
Sinatra's decision but said it ``doesn't mean this thing is over.''
Union musicians who normally work with Sinatra have refused to play
until the strike is over, he said.

<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 3rd graf to CLARIFY that secret cargo reportedly is a satellite.</HEAD>

   Space shuttle Discovery blasted off
on a secret military mission Wednesday night, staging a brilliant
Thanksgiving-eve fireworks show as it rode twin 700-foot geysers of
fire into orbit.
   ``We are delighted with the results,'' said Forrest McCartney,
director of the Kennedy Space Center. ``It's something that
Americans can be proud and thankful for on Thanksgiving.''
   As the shuttle completed its second circuit around Earth,
Mission Control gave a two-sentence status report:
   ``The crew of Discovery has been given a go for orbit
operations; the orbiter and crew are doing well,'' said spokeswoman
Billie Deason. It meant the astronauts had been given permission to
launch their secret cargo, reportedly a spy satellite to be
released in the 10th hour of flight.
   The shuttle lifted almost straight up and headed out over the
Atlantic Ocean, its booster rocket fire carving two trails in the
sky. The light could be seen in Miami, 200 miles to the south.
   ``It was 100 times brighter than a star,'' said Glenna Milberg,
a television reporter in Miami.
   Nothing was heard over the public communications channel from
Col. Frederick D. Gregory, the shuttle commander. NASA provided
launch commentary until Discovery reached orbit nine minutes after
launch and then the system went silent.
   ``Liftoff of space shuttle Discovery for its Thanksgiving Day
flight,'' said Launch Control's George Diller. Indeed, the
astronauts were carrying five meals of turkey and gravy in their
food locker.
   Night turned into day over the central Florida coast as
Discovery flashed to life with a light twice as brilliant as the
sun. The sky was cloudless, the sight dazzling.
   Liftoff occurred at 7:23 p.m. after a blacked-out countdown made
public just minutes before launch.
   At two minutes after liftoff, the spent booster rockets fell
off; ships were waiting below to recover them.
   The shuttle still was visible at the launch center as a very
bright star in the sky even when it was more than 650 miles away
and traveling about 6,800 mph.
   As the 100-ton spacecraft rocketed away, the ground a the space
center shook and windows rattled. Clouds of steam billowed out of
the flame trenches below the shuttle as 100,000 gallons of water a
minute poured out to douse the fire.
   Discovery's mission is to put a spy satellite into orbit, but
the Air Force gave no details. NASA was under instructions to say
nothing further about the mission, except to give advance landing
notice.
   The exact schedule, like everything else about this 32nd shuttle
mission, was secret.
   This was the third night launch in the shuttle program, and only
the fourth in 28 years of manned space flight. Discovery's
timetable was dictated by the cargo and its mission.
   Sources said the 2{-ton, $300 million satellite cradled in
Discovery's cargo bay is capable of listening in on military and
diplomatic communications _ voice and telemetry _ broadcast from
Soviet military installations. The satellite's duty post is to be
22,300 miles over the equator, with line-of-sight to the Soviet
Union, China, the Middle East, Africa and all of Europe.
   A similar satellite was released on a shuttle flight in 1985.
   On the last launch after dark, the fiery trail of the shuttle's
two solid rocket boosters could be seen along a 700-mile strip from
Charleston, S.C., to Key West, Fla., and in the Bahamas.
   Police in nearby Titusville prepared for about 50,000 people to
gather at prime viewing sites _ only a fraction of the crowds that
lined the roads for the early launches, but more than for other
liftoffs in recent months.
   The flight was the fifth turned over entirely to the Defense
Department.
   It is also only the third launch after dark, a timetable
dictated by the cargo and its mission.
   In late morning, National Aeronautics and Space Administration
crews turned valves to send 528,000 gallons of supercold liquid
hydrogen and liquid oxygen surging into Discovery's propellant
tank, a three-hour procedure during which the launch pad area is
cleared of people.
   When that was completed, about 1 p.m., the countdown entered a
two-hour planned hold and an inspection team went to the pad to
check for ice buildup on the fuel tank. Chunks of ice breaking away
during launch could damage the orbiter's fragile surface.
   The astronaut crew of four men and one woman slept past noon to
adjust to the mission schedule. Their flight is expected to last
four days, but NASA won't announce the landing at Edwards Air Force
Base in California until 24 hours before it's due to happen.
   Sources said the 2{-ton, $300 million satellite cradled in
Discovery's cargo bay is capable of listening in on military and
diplomatic communications _ voice and telemetry _ broadcast from
Soviet military installations. The satellite's duty post is to be
22,300 miles over the equator, with line-of-sight to the Soviet
Union, China, the Middle East, Africa and all of Europe.
   A similar satellite was released on a shuttle flight in 1985.
   Gregory, an Air Force Academy graduate, will be the first black
astronaut to command a shuttle mission. He was pilot of the shuttle
Challenger on a flight in 1985.
   Discovery's pilot is Air Force Col. John E. Blaha, making his
second flight this year. He is a replacement for astronaut S. David
Griggs, who was killed last June while practicing stunt flying for
an air show.
   The others are mission specialists F. Story Musgrave, Navy Capt.
Manley ``Sonny'' Carter Jr. and Kathryn C. Thornton.
   Military officials say the secrecy is necessary to make it more
difficult for Soviet reconnaissance satellites and a spy ship off
Cape Canaveral to track the shuttle.
   Critics argue that Soviet intelligence agents undoubtedly
already know a great deal about the mission and that once Discovery
is in orbit, they will be able to track it precisely and know what
is doing.
   The menu for the mission includes ``thermostabilized'' turkey
and gravy, which means the food has enough preservatives to be
carried without refrigeration.

<HEAD>Diver Wins Round in Bid to View `Monitor' Shipwreck</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An undersea photographer is a step closer to
becoming the first person in 10 years to dive to the wreck of the
Monitor, the ironclad Civil War ship, thanks to a decision by a
federal official.
   The government ``stonewalled'' and exaggerated safety concerns
in denying diver Gary Gentile's request to examine the shipwreck
off the North Carolina coast, said Commerce Department
administrative law judge Hugh J. Dolan.
   Dolan recommended that the government reconsider its decision
rejecting on safety grounds Gentile's applications for diving
permits to photograph the historic ship.
   Dolan's opinion this week gives the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration 15 days ``to uphold my decision or do
what they want to with it,'' the judge said in an interview on
Wednesday.
   Gentile's attorney, Peter Hess, called the decision ``a decisive
victory on behalf of public access to public property.'' Gentile is
a Philadelphia writer and undersea photographer.
   Calls to NOAA were referred to spokesman Dane Konop, who was on
leave Wednesday and unavailable for comment.
   The ironclad Monitor sank in a gale off the North Carolina coast
after a celebrated battle with the Confederate ship Merrimack 127
years ago. NOAA's refusal to allow anyone to dive to the Monitor's
watery grave for the last 10 years has angered divers, who believe
the ship is on the verge of collapsing.
   Gentile, 43, has filed 11 permit applications and written more
than 50 letters to NOAA in his quest to photograph the Monitor,
which he calls ``America's most famous shipwreck.''
   Gentile said in a brief filed with Dolan recently that he was a
victim of ``intransigence and delaying tactics'' by NOAA, and that
the agency had ignored his record as ``one of the most experienced
and skilled stage decompression scuba divers in the nation.''
   Stage decompression dives are made on compressed air. Because of
depth, they require divers to interrupt their ascent to allow
nitrogen to leave the bloodstream without forming incapacitating
bubbles.
   The Monitor is about 220 feet below the surface, a depth that
NOAA says poses ``a serious and unreasonable risk.'' NOAA's concern
is based partly on tricky currents and weather, and on the
knowledge that at certain depths, nitrogen in the breathing air can
impede divers' motor skills.
   But Dolan said, ``It appears that a significant number of
trained scuba divers frequently penetrate to depths at and in
excess of 220 feet. There is certainly an element of increased
risk, but not to the extent that restrictions on personal activity
can be justified.''
   He said the problem of nitrogen-caused lack of concentration
``is unduly exaggerated (by the agency) and contrary to the
experience of the scuba diving community as reflected in the
record.''
   Dolan also said that NOAA failed to properly apply its own
criteria and that the agency was slow to make decisions on
Gentile's requests.
   The last time NOAA granted permission to examine the Monitor was
in 1979, when it allowed a dive by French explorer Jacques
Cousteau's party. But the visibility was poor and little or no
usable footage was produced.
   Dolan said Cousteau's application was handled differently than
Gentile's by NOAA. ``While he (Dolan) was stonewalled, Cousteau was
encouraged,'' the judge said.

<TEXT>
   NASA has pulled the plug on the
venerable Solar Maximum satellite, jettisoning the antenna and
rendering the spacecraft mute.
   Solar Max has been getting scientific information about the sun
for nearly 10 years, but the fuel that has kept it out of the pull
of Earth's atmosphere is running out. The satellite is expected to
make its fiery plunge back to Earth about Nov. 29.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said the
satellite was at an altitude of 166.1 miles Wednesday, a 40-mile
drop from its Oct. 31 position, and the rate of descent is
accelerating.
   Technicians sent a signal on Wednesday to blow off the
satellite's high-gain antenna as an engineering test ``to determine
if the system, dormant for 9.5 years, still operated,'' NASA said.
   Without the antenna, the spacecraft can't communicate with
another satellite overhead, although three of its seven instruments
continue to take data that can be retrieved when Solar Max passes
over ground stations.
   ``The final engineering exercise, the jettisoning of SMM's solar
panels, will be conducted when officials conclude that science
operations should cease,'' NASA said. ``It is estimated that this
exercise will be performed within the next couple of days.''

<HEAD>Oliver North Appeals Iran-Contra Convictions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oliver North, urging the reversal of his
Iran-Contra convictions, says the judge in his trial ``inexplicably
failed'' to require proof that his case was untainted by his
immunized testimony to Congress.
   In court papers filed Wednesday, North's lawyers say he was
prosecuted in ``stunning disregard'' for his Fifth Amendment rights.
   ``North's six days of compelled testimony were carried live ...
and reprinted ... with Pearl Harbor headlines,'' said the court
papers.
   A 1972 Supreme Court ruling prohibits prosecutors from using
immunized testimony.
   Under that ruling, ``the prosecution must `systematically
establish an independent source for each and every item of evidence
which may have been considered by the indicting grand jury,''' said
North, quoting a 1985 appeals court case.
   The 70-page brief and nine volumes of supporting material were
submitted in support of North's appeal made in July.
   U.S. District Court Judge Gerhard Gesell ``inexplicably failed''
to require independent counsel Lawrence Walsh to make a showing
that the information in the North prosecution came independently of
North's congressional testimony, said his lawyers.
   The court was required to make a ``witness-by-witness,
item-by-item showing'' that testimony hadn't been derived from
North's immunized statements to Congress.
   All Gesell did, said North, was to conduct a pre-trial hearing
to ensure that prosecutors weren't exposed to immunized testimony.
   Gesell ``apparently concluded that `warnings' to the witnesses
not to testify to anything `learned' from North's immunized
testimony would suffice,'' said the court papers.
   North was convicted of aiding and abetting an obstruction of
Congress, destroying government documents and accepting an illegal
gratuity. The former Marine was at the heart of the Reagan
administration's effort to arm the Nicaraguan rebels during a
congressional ban on U.S. military aid to the Contras.
   In seeking to have his convictions overturned, North's lawyers
also said Gesell erred when he:
   _Quashed a defense subpoena seeking to compel ex-President
Reagan to testify at North's trial.
   _Refused to give any jury instruction concerning authorization
by Reagan administration higher-ups of his activities for which he
later was charged with crimes.
   North's lawyers also said Gesell shouldn't have excluded
videotaped portions of congressional testimony by former national
security adviser John Poindexter, North's boss.
   North was sentenced to two years probation and ordered to
perform 1,200 hours of community service, in addition to a $150,000
fine.

   If this nation's leftist
guerrillas were trying to make a point by assaulting one of its
wealthiest neighborhoods, seizing part of a luxury hotel for day,
they succeeded.
   ``They've proved they can hit where they want to, when they want
to,'' said Eduardo Luis Quiroz, an insurance salesman whose
comfortable home is overlooked by the hotel.
   Quiroz, an insurance executive who used to work as an explosives
expert for DuPont Inc., pointed to ceilings and furniture shattered
by two hand grenades and said he had been held at gunpoint by the
guerrillas.
   ``They said they wouldn't hurt any of us. They threw the
grenades because they thought there was a sniper on the roof,''
said one of Quiroz' maids, Ana Francisca Perez.
   She, Quiroz and another maid had been working all day to clear
shattered china, pieces of a garden trellis and other debris after
the guerrilla attack on Escalon ended Wednesday morning.
   About 150 guerrillas had come up through a nearby ravine before
dawn Tuesday, occupying parts of the neighborhood and the VIP Tower
of the luxury hotel, where at least eight U.S. Green Berets were
trapped for 28 hours.
   Escalon climbs a hillside near the San Salvador Volcano in the
city's northwest. Most homes are large and beautiful, with four-car
garages and gardens of bougainvillea, roses and white porcelana,
but they are also surrounded by stone walls topped with reels of
razor-sharp concertina wire.
   Throughout the neighborhood there were signs of combat _ downed
tree limbs and electric wires, windows blown out, burned cars. But
it hardly equaled the destruction in poorer neighborhoods, where
fighting raged for most of the rebel Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front's 11-day offensive.
   Still, the neighborhood was shaken.
   ``Some people are talking about forming a neighborhood defense
committee,'' said Alfredo Martinez Moreno, a lawyer who was El
Salvador's foreign minister in 1967-68 and and head of the Supreme
Court until 1972.
   ``It would have to be well-controlled because people might think
it's a death squad,'' he said.
   He noted that such committees had been banned under the
government of Jose Napoleon Duarte, who gave way to President
Alfredo Cristiani on June 1.
   Martinez Moreno said a neighbor's house had been shot up and
bombed by guerrillas who discovered literature supporting Arena,
Cristiani's right-wing party, which has been linked in the past to
death squads.
   He said he was in Washington but flew back when Tuesday's attack
began. Worried that his home would be bombed as poorer
neighborhoods were, he knew who to call.
   ``I'm not political any more, but I know Cristiani and I asked
him if they were going to bomb us,'' he said.
   Cristiani asked for his address, Moreno said, then called back
and said there would be no bombardment.
   Asked Wednesday why Escalon had not been hit, Cristiani told
reporters that air force policy is to strike only when guerrilla
concentrations are isolated, with little danger to civilians.
   ``The neighborhood where they dig in has nothing to do with the
response,'' said Cristiani, noting that the Escalon fighting was
less severe and briefer than elsewhere.
   Martinez Mancera said that his telephones were out, too, but he
called the president of the telephone company.
   ``They'll be fixed tomorrow,'' he said he was told.
   Quiroz, who said he served in the U.S. Army and was wounded in
the Korean War, didn't think much of the Salvadoran army's
performance.
   ``They should have known, their intelligence failed. The
guerrillas come down the ravine from the volcano. It's like playing
billiards _ the 8-ball in the corner pocket. Obvious,'' he said.
   Rafael Rivera, another neighbor, said he heard guerrillas
enjoying the power of their guns, yelling ``I love that car''
before shooting it up.
   The guerrillas set other cars on fire and torched part of an
exclusive country club nearby.
   Neighbors gave patrolling Salvadoran soldiers packs of
cigarettes and other gifts. Quiroz brought out a moth-eaten olive
army scarf he had worn in Korea and gave it to a sergeant.
   He picked up 31 M-16 cartridges, 10 AK-47 cartridges and 7
Dragunov sniper rifle cartridges and arranged them on the curb
outside his house.
   ``People are still shaking around here,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   East Germany's historic decision to
open its borders last month has failed to halt the stream of
citizens heading West to live, with more than 40,000 arriving since
travel restrictions were lifted.
   Millions of East Germans have crossed as tourists into West
Germany since Nov. 9, taking advantage of their new freedom to see
the long-forbidden West and buy goods not available at home.
   As of Wednesday, nearly 11 million East German citizens had
received visas to travel to the West. East Germany has a population
of 16.5 million.
   But the stream of East Germans crossing into West Germany with
the intention of staying has not stopped despite East Germany's
promises of political and economic reforms.
   East Germany granted free travel to assauge growing public
unrest and the tens of thousands of its citizens fleeing across the
borders. More than 200,000 have fled permanently this year, many of
them young skilled workers including doctors and teachers.
   The federal Interior Ministry said Wednesday that within the
previous 24 hours 1,694 East German resettlers had arrived in West
Germany.
   Since East Germany opened its borders on Nov. 9, about 44,000
East Germans have arrived as permanent residents, the ministry said.
   The continuing stream of resettlers indicates continuing
pessimism that conditions, especially economic ones, in East
Germany will be dramatically changing for the better anytime soon.
   Nonetheless, the stream of East Germans coming as tourists is
far greater.
   More than half a million East German tourists crossed into West
Germany and West Berlin on Tuesday, crowding downtown streets and
jamming into stores.
   But it was an official holiday in the West on Wednesday, and
border police said the stream had ebbed considerably _ something
over 10,000. Banks that hand out 100 marks, $55, in free
government-donated ``welcome money,'' as well as most stores, were
closed for the day.
   ``I have not seen it this quiet in 14 days. Our colleagues with
the GDR (German Democratic Republic) border guards are finally
getting a breather,'' said Wolfgant Schlee, spokesman for the
Bavarian border police in Munich.
   The influxes of East German tourists have caused huge traffic
backups at East German border crossings as the travelers line up to
cross into the West in their sputtering Trabant and Wartburg sedans.
   West Berlin police said streets there were also quieter.
   ``But travel from West (Berlin) to East (Berlin) has increased.
Many people wanted to use the holiday to have a look at the Eastern
side,'' said a West Berlin police spokesman, who did not give his
name.
   The open borders also have fueled the East German black market.
The Communist government on Wednesday announced a ban on the
removal of antiques and consumer goods that might be sold abroad.
   The anti-smuggling effort was announced late Wednesday by East
Germany's official ADN news agency, which gave no details of the
restrictions except to say that they were effective immediately.
   Both government and opposition forces have called for more
stringent customs controls to prevent East Germans from taking
their valuables to the West and selling them for hard currency.

<HEAD>Mitchell Renews Call for Publicly Financed Congressional Campaigns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The current system of financing congressional
campaigns is ``demeaning to everybody'' and should be replaced _ at
least in part _ by publicly financed races, Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell says.
   While avoiding direct comment on the ethics problems of five
Senate colleagues, Mitchell said merely questioning lawmakers'
standard of conduct is insufficient.
   ``There isn't any clearly established line'' on what services a
senator should or should not provide to constituents and political
donors, the Maine Democrat told reporters during an end-of-session
interview Wednesday.
   Mitchell was questioned in connection with an ethics committee
probe into five senators' intervention with federal regulators on
behalf of Lincoln Savings and Loan Association. Lincoln's collapse
is expected to become the nation's largest S&amp;L failure at a cost of
up to $2.5 billion.
   The five _ Sens. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; Dennis DeConcini,
D-Ariz.; John McCain, R-Ariz.; John Glenn, D-Ohio, and Donald W.
Riegle Jr., D-Mich. _ received or solicited a total of $1.3 million
in political contributions from Lincoln's owner, Phoenix
millionaire Charles H. Keating Jr.
   All five have told the ethics committee they violated no laws or
Senate rules and have denied charges that their meetings in April
1987 with regulators on behalf of Lincoln were improper.
   Mitchell said all lawmakers are vulnerable to accusations of
conflict of interest because they can be seen as beholden to people
who helped them get elected. He said he plans to push early next
year for a review of Senate ethical guidelines, which he said are
more vague than those in the House.
   But he also said focusing solely on ethics rules is ``treating
the symptom, not the cause.''
   ``We have to change the method, the system, by which we elect
public officials in our society and by which we finance and conduct
campaigns,'' he said. In doing so, Mitchell restated his past call
for public financing of congressional campaigns.
   Mitchell said there is built-in conflict because members of the
House and Senate know they're expected to ``bring home the bacon''
for their constituents, whether it involves saving a military base
or getting a new federal building opened.
   But he said he was not optimistic about the prospects of
achieving major campaign finance changes when the 101st Congress
convenes for its second session Jan. 23.
   ``This system is demeaning for everybody. It's not a good system
... The Republicans have got a big advantage and they don't want to
give up that advantage,'' he said. ``That's the single direct fact.
I think it really is in their interest to change it.''
   Mitchell was referring to the Republican Party's historical
ability to eclipse the Democrats in raising money from the
wealthiest donors.
   ``The fact of the matter is that voters like and reward _ in the
form of approval at the polls _ people who they think are
aggressively representing them,'' he said. ``We've developed a
whole colloquial language about it: `Bring home the bacon.'''

   When jazz guitarist Larry Carlton sits down
to Thanksgiving dinner today, his family will be more mindful than
many other Americans of life's blessings.
   ``Every time I see those kids, I am thankful to be alive,'' said
Carlton, who was shot in the neck nearly 20 months ago when he
surprised two teen-age intruders outside his Hollywood Hills studio.
   The bullet severed a vocal cord and left one of Carlton's arms
paralyzed, and many thought his music career was over.
   The entertainment industry mourned the loss of the talent
Carlton demonstrated in making 11 albums. He won the Grammy Award
in 1988 for best pop instrumental for his version of the Doobie
Brothers' ``Minute by Minute,'' and in 1981 shared a Grammy with
pianist Mike Post for the ``Hill Street Blues'' theme.
   He had worked as a composer, arranger and performer with Joni
Mitchell, Michael Jackson, Quincy Jones, Ray Charles and the group
Steely Dan. He toured with the Fifth Dimension and the Crusaders.
   But the 41-year-old entertainer didn't give up, persevering
through extensive physical training and voice therapy.
   His ``On Solid Ground'' album this year was warmly received,
rising to No. 3 on the jazz music charts, and this week he released
a new album, ``Christmas at My House.''
   ``You bet I'm thankful,'' Carlton said in a Thanksgiving eve
interview from his home in northern Los Angeles County. ``I think
I'm most thankful to have my total health back and to watch my kids
grow up. I'm also thankful to be able to make music.''
   While he doesn't dwell on the near-fatal shooting April 6, 1988,
there are some haunting memories of the attack.
   ``I was real close to dying and it changes you. I'm not sure
exactly how it changes because life is very much back to normal for
me. But every time I see Katie and Travis I am thankful to be
alive,'' Carlton said.
   Katie, 9, and Travis, 7, will be at the dinner table with
Carlton's wife, singer Michele Pillar, and both entertainers'
parents.
   ``It will be a nice day for us,'' Carlton said.
   Carlton still drives each day to the Hollywood Hills recording
studio where he was shot, and says he isn't fearful of becoming a
victim again. There were never any arrests for the shooting.
   ``That's where my faith in God takes over,'' he said. ``I'm not
saying I'm not cautious. Every time I lock the door and go to my
car I look around.''
   And Carlton may even sing again, even though ``the nerve that
controls my left vocal cord was blown away.''
   ``Ask me about that in 18 months,'' he said with enthusiasm.
``There was a period this summer where my voice got much stronger.
It might happen.''

<HEAD>Nader Launches Campaign to Repeal Pay Raise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ralph Nader is launching a campaign to repeal
a congressional pay raise and limit members of Congress to 12 years
in office.
   ``Such governmental misbehavior and effrontery cannot
continue,'' Nader said at a news conference Wednesday. ``The pay
grab of November 1989 is symbolic of the government rot that is
reaching critical mass.''
   Nader called the bipartisan leadership agreement that allowed
the rapid passage of the pay raise a ``two-party cabal'' that used
``dictatorial procedural practices.''
   Nader wants to persuade Congress to reverse itself on the pay
raise when it meets next year, or barring that, to generate
opposition to members of Congress who supported the raise and face
re-election next year.
   Members of Congress, Nader said, already receive an adequate
salary, a lavish pension and other benefits, and are in the top 1
percent of all Americans in pay.
   He disputed the notion that paying more would attract more
qualified people to government.
   ``All it does is increases their greed,'' Nader said.
   He said he also wanted a constitutional amendment to limit
members of Congress to 12 years in office, saying it would reduce
the power of legislative leaders who pushed the pay raise.
   House salaries will increase from $89,500 to about $125,000 by
1991, while members will be barred from collecting pay for
speeches. Senate salaries would rise to about $100,000, but
senators may still take money for speeches.

<HEAD>Retired Federal Judge Haynsworth Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Clement F. Haynsworth Jr., whose
nomination to the Supreme Court was rejected by the Senate in 1969
because of questions about his judicial ethics and views on
minorities, has died of a heart attack at age 77.
   Haynsworth, a semi-retired federal judge, died Wednesday at
home, said his wife, Dorothy. He had continued hearing cases
part-time during the past year despite heart problems, she said.
   President Eisenhower named Haynsworth in 1957 to the 4th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., and he was senior judge
there when President Nixon nominated him for the Supreme Court seat
left vacant by Justice Abe Fortas' resignation.
   The Senate Judiciary Committee voted 10-7 in favor of the
nomination, but the full Senate defeated it 55-45 on Nov. 21, 1969.
   Former Chief Justice Warren Burger called Haynsworth ``one of
the outstanding judges in this country. It was a great loss when he
was not confirmed to the Supreme Court.''
   ``I'll miss him,'' said U.S. Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C. ``He
was a special friend and one of the nation's finest jurists. I only
regret that the American people were denied his exceptional talents
on the nation's highest court.''
   The most damaging questions about the nomination centered on
Haynsworth's participation in a case involving a company that did
extensive business with a company in which he owned a one-seventh
interest.
   In addition, civil rights groups and organized labor opposed
Haynsworth's nomination, portraying him as insensitive to
minorities and working people.
   Haynsworth later said the criticisms of his stance on racial
issues were unfair.
   ``What happened was we had a terrible practical problem,'' he
explained in 1977. ``You couldn't jump from complete segregation to
complete integration in a moment. The critics felt I didn't press
forward as rapidly as they might have hoped.''
   When a federal building in Greenville was renamed in his honor
in May 1983, Haynsworth called it ``a touching footnote to the
history of 1969.''
   At that ceremony, Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. said
the Senate's rejection was ``purely political'' and that
``injustice was done'' by the vote.
   Haynsworth spent 17 years as chief justice on the circuit court
in Richmond before retiring as a full-time judge in 1981.
   After taking senior status, Haynsworth maintained an office in
the Greenville federal building. He said he wanted to step down to
give up ``the business of housekeeping'' to have time to do ``the
business of a judge.''
   Haynsworth was graduated from Furman University summa cum laude
in 1933 and from Harvard Law School in 1936. He was admitted to the
bar in 1936 and joined his family's law firm.
   Besides his wife, Haynsworth is survived by a brother, Harry
Haynsworth III of Greenville; a sister, Betty Taylor of Columbia; a
stepson and three grandchildren. A funeral was planned for Friday.

`After the ... astral considerations.' Picks up 5th, `Some columnists ...'

   A top politician pays big money to a
mystic for his election victory.
   An astrologist prescribes gems to members of Parliament for
their success in the polls. A wise man who walks around naked
blesses his candidates by patting their heads with his feet.
   Swamis, stargazers, gurus and palm readers are raking it in
during the Indian election as dozens of unsure candidates seek that
special something to catapult them to victory.
   ``Jupiter is rising,'' said noted astrologer R.N. Sharma as the
voting began earlier this week. ``That means a close fight.''
   After the election was called last month, astrologers were
consulted on the best time to file nomination papers. The respected
Times of India newspaper reported that the release of the governing
Congress Party manifesto was delayed because of astral
considerations.
   Some columnists have claimed that the voting, which began
Wednesday, was also scheduled with the heavens in mind.
   ``We live in unsure times,'' says political commentator Bhabani
Sen Gupta. ``All of us, especially politicians, are worried about
the future. A little occult often sets the mind at ease.''
   Stargazing and palm reading in India date back to before the
time of Christ. Two sages, Parashara and Bhrigu, are credited with
writing texts explaining the cosmos.
   The idea of reincarnation, one of the foundations of the Hindu
philosophy, plays a central role in their writings. The sages also
borrowed liberally from the Assyrians, who flourished in southwest
Asia around the 7th century B.C. and are believed to have invented
what has become the modern-day horoscope.
   Astrology has played its role in modern Indian history.
   On Aug. 15, 1947, India became independent of British rule. But
it happened at midnight, not an auspicious hour. Fable has it that
Viceroy Louis Mountbatten, the famed British naval officer who
supervised the transfer of power, was angered that none of his
advisers was familiar with astrology.
   Over the last 25 years, astrology and other soothsaying arts
have grown in popularity, especially among India's middle and upper
classes.
   Commentator Sen Gupta reports that few of his friends and
political colleagues are without an astrologer or a palm reader.
Others visit gurus and holy men. He himself journeys to a seer in
Calcutta every year.
   ``Development creates rootlessness,'' he explains. ``In
traditional societies everything was so very certain. You consulted
an astrologer only for acute situations _ marriage or death. Now,
nobody knows what will happen.''
   The result has been fame and fortune for many a pundit, a
Sanskrit word for soothsayer. Astrologers, palmists and gurus have
set up shop in top hotels and charge thousands of rupees _ hundreds
of dollars _ for a session.
   Harvest time for India's people of the occult occurs when the
nation votes. India's lively state-run press is filled with
predictions and politicians seek out the savants for advice on how
to achieve victory.
   Lately, Sharma has been recommending gems.
   ``They all need power stones,'' Sharma says of the 40 members of
Parliament he claims as his clients. ``Yellow and blue sapphires,
those are selling fast.''
   He says the sapphires work by harnessing the power of Saturn and
Jupiter, planets which play ``a critical role in politics.''
   Other politicians have commissioned yogis to pray for their
victory. The Indian Express reported that Home Minister Buta Singh
paid 5 million rupees (about $300,000) for a tantric prayer
session, or pooja.
   Even Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi has reportedly visited Devra
Baba, a sadhu, or Hindu holy man. The Baba, as he is known, is a
nudist and blesses his followers by touching their heads with the
balls of his feet.
   Ben Gupta sees the trend as dangerous for India.
   ``All this black magic stuff encourages resignation and
acceptance of one's fate,'' he says. ``We don't need that here. We
are poor so we must struggle.''
   Sharma says he believes the more astrology the better. The only
change he recommends is in India's money.
   ``We have no mention of God on our bills,'' he says, fingering a
100 rupee note. ``That is why America is so great. Every bill says,
`In God We Trust.'''

<HEAD>Hungarian, Polish Refugee Applications Curtailed by U.S.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department, citing ``the democratic
evolution'' Poland and Hungary, will stop processing new
applications from the countries' refugees in Western Europe to
resettle in the United States.
   In addition, officials said, about 19,000 of the estimated
20,000 applications already on file likely will be rejected,
because, with few exceptions, only those refugees with strong
family ties in the United States will now be admitted.
   The announcement was met with dismay from Polish-American and
Hungarian-American groups, as well as the Roman Catholic Church,
even though the Bush administration had served notice to Congress
weeks ago that it likely would curtail the admittance of Polish and
Hungarian refugees in light of political changes in their homelands.
   Dawn T. Calabia, a U.S. Catholic Conference official who was
among private leaders briefed Wednesday at the White House on the
cutback, said the administration ``is basically saying that there
are 19,000 applicants who now don't have to be considered.
   ``There's no question the administration is short on
resources,'' she said. ``But I wonder if we sacrifice our
principles because of resources. At the very least, it's a very
ungenerous policy for some of the people who have been on the
waiting list for years.''
   The 20,000 current applicants represent but a fraction of the
Polish and Hungarian refugee population in Western Europe.
According to the Roman Catholic Church, there are more than 100,000
Polish refugees on the continent.
   Even without the policy change, comparatively few would have had
a chance for imminent admittance to the United States under
President Bush's refugee ceilings for this fiscal year.
   Those ceilings, totaling 125,000 worldwide, allow for 6,500
refugees from Eastern Europe in the current budget year, and most
of those already have gone to applicants from Hungary and Poland,
according to State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler. She
said that ``unless we change our present policy and practices, we
will be unable this year to process and admit other deserving
applicants from such countries as Bulgaria and Romania.''
   In the last eight years, 33,060 Poles and 5,459 Hungarians have
come to the United States as refugees. Federal law defines a
refugee as a person with ``a well-founded fear of persecution'' on
account of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or
membership in a particular social group.''
   Gerald Coyle, acting chief of staff of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, told Congress earlier that because of the
democratic changes in Poland and Hungary, most of the refugees from
those nations ``are unlikely to have very substantive claims to
U.S. refugee status.''
   Ms. Calabia acknowledged that the Poles and Hungarians ``are not
in imminent danger, as a boat person might be, but these are people
still looking to the United States for a future and they deserve a
hearing and an interview.''
   Moreover, said Ms. Calabia, many of the refugees ``still have a
`well-founded' fear'' of the consequences of returning to their
homelands because, despite democratic change at the top, ``the
local (Communist Party) apparatchik is still in control in many
areas.''

<HEAD>Bush Says U.S. Forces Liberate Hotel, but Then Account Changes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House blames initial information
from the Pentagon for President Bush's statement that elite U.S.
troops swept a hotel in El Salvador to rescue American Green Berets
barricaded inside.
   Shortly after Bush made the statement on Wednesday, the
administration said the special troops never entered the hotel.
   Witnesses in El Salvador reported the dozen Green Berets left
the hotel without incident after leftist rebels who had besieged it
apparently withdrew during the night.
   Bush, speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One, said a unit
of the Army's elite Delta Force commandos swept the hotel to make
sure there were no remaining guerrillas or mines to harm the Green
Berets but that there was no fighting. ``Thank God they didn't have
to fire a shot,'' he said.
   Bush said to reporters, ``That hotel was liberated with finality
from the clutches of this outrageous guerrilla attack.'' Bush was
on his way to Memphis to speak on volunteerism.
   ``This morning the Salvadoran special forces, joined by U.S.
elements of special operations went through that hotel, and I can
tell you I'm very pleased that all the Americans have been
released. There was no loss of life,'' Bush said.
   Shortly after Bush spoke, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
issued a statement saying, ``Updated information showed U.S. forces
did not actually enter the hotel. Entry proved to be unnecessary.''
   Fitzwater explained, ``The first information from the Pentagon
was wrong.'' He said, ``It's not a big deal, anyway'' since the
Green Berets were freed unharmed. ``It doesn't make any difference
whether they (Delta commandos) went in or not.''
   Bush said he consulted with Salvadoran President Alfredo
Cristiani, who had not requested U.S. help in dealing with the
guerrillas who took over the hotel Tuesday.
   ``I told him what we were going to do and he acquiesced,'' Bush
said.
   One U.S. official commenting on condition of anonymity said of
the American special operations forces: ``They were sent. They were
in position. ... But as the operation evolved, they never went into
action. The bad guys melted away and the 12 came out.''
   In El Salvador, the Green Berets chatted with reporters after
leaving the hotel, saying they never considered themselves hostages
although they barricaded themselves behind mattresses. They said
they never exchanged fire with the guerrillas.
   On another aspect of the situation in El Salvador, Bush was
asked about recent raids by the rightist government on Catholic,
Baptist and Lutheran churches. He said, ``I would condemn it
totally'' unless the church workers harbored guerrillas or
otherwise involved themselves in the war.
   The U.S.-backed Salvadoran government contends the churches,
most of which say they are merely working with the poor, are
bastions of support for the leftist Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front rebels.
   The Americans inside the Salvadoran hotel were a dozen Army
Green Beret special forces troops who had been on a two-week
training mission in El Salvador and were scheduled to return to the
United States on Tuesday, U.S. officials said.
   The United States has provided about $3.5 billion to oppose the
insurgency over the past decade, but Congress has forbidden U.S.
troops from acting in other than an advisory capacity. Bush said
the troops he sent were only there to rescue Americans.

<HEAD>FAA Says Pilot Didn't Submit Flight Plan to Passengers' Vote</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal authorities rejected two airline
passengers' claim that their pilot asked passengers to vote on
whether he should continue a flight in a storm.
   The Federal Aviation Administration has determined that the
American Airlines pilot acted properly, FAA spokeswoman Kathleen
Bergen said Wednesday.
   The agency found that the decision to divert a flight from
LaGuardia Airport in New York City to a small airport in upstate
New York Nov. 16 was made by the airline, rather than at the
passengers' behest, Bergen said.
   ``Nobody did anything wrong,'' Bergen said. ``The issue is
closed.''
   But Muriel and Fred Sider of suburban Chicago insisted the pilot
on Flight 492 from Chicago let passengers vote on where to land.
   ``I understand instructions when I hear them, and my wife's been
a travel agent for 20 years,'' said Sider, who owns an advertising
agency. ``I don't think we both could have misunderstood it.''
   The decision to land the airplane at Stewart Airport near
Newburgh, N.Y., was made by officials at American's headquarters in
Dallas, said airline spokesman Tom Stack. ``There was never any
question raised to the passengers about the diversion,'' he said.
   Once the plane landed at Stewart, passengers were asked to vote
on whether they wanted to be bused into New York City, or take a
return flight to Chicago, Stack said.
   The pilot, whom Stack refused to identify, ``did what he was
supposed to do and handled himself in a professional manner,'' he
said.
   The plane landed in a heavy rainstorm at Stewart. Strong winds
that day collapsed a cafeteria wall at an elementary school three
miles from Stewart, killing nine pupils.
   The Siders' version of events is quite different from that given
by American and backed by the FAA.
   ``About an hour into the flight the pilot got on the loudspeaker
and said that LaGuardia was definitely closed in, but they could
get into Stewart Airport ... and wanted a vote as to how the
passengers felt,'' said Mrs. Sider, 61. ``The stewardesses took a
show of hands.''
   ``That's carrying democracy a touch too far,'' said her husband.
``I don't want to be involved in safety decisions.''

<HEAD>One Man Spreads AIDS Infection to at Least 11 women</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women who think they are safe from AIDS because
they avoid risky sex ``may have a false sense of security,'' say
researchers who traced 11 cases of AIDS infection to sexual
relations with the same man.
   The women, all Belgians, were largely well-educated and
middle-class and averaged 2{ sexual partners over a three-year
period. But despite their seemingly low risk, they caught the virus
from a civil engineer who probably contracted it in Africa.
   Researchers said their study ``emphasizes that middle-class
women'' can catch the virus even though they don't have sex with
drug addicts or bisexuals.
   ``Women who do not consider themselves at risk because they do
not engage in what they perceive as high-risk sexual practices may
have a false sense of security,'' they wrote in today's New England
Journal of Medicine.
   Doctors said the cluster of infection is the largest to be
documented among heterosexuals since the epidemic emerged almost a
decade ago.
   ``In my view, it is only the tip of the iceberg,'' said Dr.
Nathan Clumeck. ``It's probably something that will be more
frequently described in the future among heterosexuals without
apparent risk factors.''
   He and his co-authors said the spread should also serve as a
warning to women who believe they can avoid the AIDS virus by
limiting themselves to a few sexual partners.
   ``Emphasizing only sexual relations with multiple partners as a
risk factor for women may be irrelevant and even
counterproductive,'' they wrote, ``since it implies that the
absence of multiple partners makes women `safe.'''
   Clumeck, a physician at St. Pierre University Hospital in
Brussels, was the report's principal author.
   Their detective work began in 1985, when a Belgian woman in
Antwerp was found to have AIDS-related symptoms. She said an
African man was the only person from whom she could have caught the
virus.
   About the same time, two other Belgian women and an African
woman in Brussels were found to carry HIV, the AIDS virus. All of
them named the same man as a possible source of their infections.
   After interviewing the man _ who did not know he was infected _
they obtained the names of 19 women with whom he had sex over the
previous three years.
   Eighteen of the women agreed to be tested, and 11 turned out to
be infected. These 11 named eight other male sex partners, and one
of these men was also infected with HIV.
   Clumeck said the cluster is probably larger, however, because
the African man said he had about 20 sexual partners a year but
could not remember most of their names.
   The man who spread the virus moved from central Africa to
Belgium in 1963 but traveled frequently in parts of Africa where
the AIDS virus is common among heterosexuals.
   He died of AIDS-related illness in 1986. Among the 11 infected
women, three have AIDS, one has pre-AIDS illness and six others
have swollen lymph glands, another symptom of infection.
   ``In the United States, particularly, heterosexuals thought to
be at risk belong mostly to IV drug users or people with contact
with prostitutes or prostitutes themselves,'' said Clumeck. ``The
interesting feature of this cluster is that most of the women are
middle-class and well-educated.''
   Among the 19 sexual partners, 12 were Europeans, eight were
married, none used intravenousdrugs and they said they had between
one and four sexual partners during the previous three years. Two
of those who got infected had sex just once with the African man.
   ``It highlights the risks associated with heterosexual contact
and, in particular with the documentation of two transmissions
after one contact, the important of safer sex practices,'' said Dr.
Nancy Padian of the University of California, San Francisco.
   She has documented a similar case of one man spreading the
infection to four women.

<HEAD>Building Firms Agree to Pay U.S. For Bid-Rigging</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of Japanese construction firms has agreed
to pay the U.S. government $32.6 million to settle a dispute over
alleged bid-rigging of projects at an American military base near
Tokyo, U.S. officials said today.
   The U.S. side had threatened lawsuits both in Japan and the
United States unless a settlement was reached.
   Representatives from seven Japanese construction firms and
American officials signed the Memorandum of Intent on behalf of 99
Japanese firms, the U.S. Justice Department said in a statement.
   The memorandum stipulates that the payment be made by December
20, according to the statement, which was released by the U.S.
Embassy.
   Officials from Japanese companies involved in negotiations were
not available for comment because of a national holiday in Japan.
   The U.S. government alleges 140 Japanese construction and
related firms were involved in the bid rigging and the statement
said the Justice Department would continue to seek damages from the
41 not covered by the memorandum.
   Some executives among the 41 firms have said they should not
have to pay compensation since they did not bid on the disputed
sections of the project. The 41 firms are expected to hold a
separate talks with the U.S. side.
   In the negotiations, the U.S. side demanded a total of $34.8
million in compensation from the 140 firms, which participated in
construction projects at the U.S. Navy base at Yokosuka, southwest
of Tokyo, between April 1984 and September 1987.
   During the period, the U.S. Navy awarded 140 firms a combined
total of $134.9 million worth of orders, including construction of
a housing complex for military personnel.
   The U.S. side claimed there were improper charges and
bid-rigging in connection with the construction at the base.
    In December, Japan's Fair Trade Commission issued warnings to
140 Japanese firms for their alleged prior consultations, or
``dango,'' in setting prices of projects undertaken at the base.
   The dango system, long established in Japan's construction
industry, is considered an anti-competitive practice that prevents
firms outside the group, including foreign firms, from getting
contracts.
   In another development, the U.S. government said Wednesday it
would not impose retaliatory sanctions against Japan in a trade
dispute over the ability of American companies to compete for
construction work in Japan.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said she determined that
Japan had made ``significant progress'' in allowing U.S. companies
to compete on construction jobs, including allowing American
companies to bid on five major airport projects.

<HEAD>Study: Boiled Coffee Raises Cholesterol; Filtered Coffee Okay</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Filtered coffee, by far the favorite among U.S.
coffee drinkers, may also be the healthiest brew for the heart, a
study says.
   The research in today's New England Journal of Medicine found a
strong link between rising cholesterol levels and boiled coffee, a
brewing method popular in Scandinavia.
   People who used this method for nine weeks had a 10 percent rise
in their cholesterol levels, which translates into a 20 percent
increase in their risk of heart disease. But when they stayed with
filtered coffee, the most popular brewing method in the United
States, their cholesterol levels remained steady.
   ``The bottom line of the study is that it seems the way you make
your coffee makes a large difference,'' said Dr. Diederick E.
Grobbee of Erasmus University Medical School in the Netherlands.
   But despite the latest research, the possible link between
coffee and cholesterol remains confusing. Last week, a report
presented at the annual meeting of the American Heart Association
by Stanford University researchers concluded that decaffeinated
coffee is the true cholesterol villain.
   In a statement, the National Coffee Association characterized
Grobbee's finding as good news because it exonerates the kind of
coffee most Americans drink.
   Still, the association conceded that ``there appears to be an
association between boiled coffee and cholesterol.''
   About 75 percent of U.S. coffee drinkers make filtered coffee.
They use either electric drip machines or manual filter pots.
   In the study, Grobbee and Dr. Annette A.A. Bak compared this
with boiled coffee, which is made by pouring boiling water into a
pot of ground coffee and letting it sit for 10 minutes. The
technique is similar to percolating coffee, still used by 20
percent of U.S. coffee drinkers.
   Grobbee said that the latest findings raise concerns that
percolators might also have a bad effect on cholesterol.
   ``Without having tested the possibility,'' he said, ``there is
some reason to believe it might be somewhat similar.''
   In the study, 107 young adults with normal cholesterol levels
drank filtered coffee for three weeks. Then they were randomly
assigned to drink four to six cups a day of boiled coffee, four to
six cups of filtered coffee or no coffee at all.
   After nine weeks, their total cholesterol levels rose 10 percent
after switching to boiled coffee, but they were unchanged in those
who used filtered coffee or those who abstained.
   Grobbee offered three possible explanations for why boiled
coffee seems to raise cholesterol:
   _It's made with hotter water than drip coffee.
   _The water stays in contact with the coffee grounds longer.
   _Filters screen out some cholesterol-raising substance in coffee.
   ``There is in coffee a very potent substance in terms of the
effect on cholesterol,'' said Grobbee. ``It's timely to put energy
into detecting what that substance is. It seems that by filtering
your coffee, you can remove it.''

<HEAD>Father Plans Quiet Thanksgiving With Family</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who had to tell his only child she
isn't his biological daughter planned a quiet family Thanksgiving
to reassure the 10-year-old he's raised since birth that ``I'm
still your daddy.''
   ``I don't even care about the turkey,'' Robert Mays said
Wednesday.
   He's worried about Kimberly Michelle Mays, a sensitive
fifth-grader who learned Mays isn't her biological daughter. ``I
just want to concentrate on Kim, making her as happy as possible.
She's confused. She's going through a tremendous amount of
emotional disappointment in her life,'' he said.
   Mays told Kimberly genetic tests proved she is really the
daughter of Ernest and Regina Twigg, parents of seven other
children. The girl the Twiggs raised as Arlena, who died of heart
disease last year, was really the child of Mays and his wife
Barbara, who died in 1981.
   The girls were born three days apart at Hardee Memorial Hospital
in rural Wauchula in 1978.
   After Mays learned the news Friday, he broke it to the blonde,
hazel-eyed youngster.
   ``Kimberly is totally aware of what is going on,'' he said.
``I've tried not to keep anything a secret from her.''
   She cried for a long time, then asked what it meant to their
relationship.
   ``I held her, she just simply wept. I was crying myself. She
said, `daddy, daddy, daddy, what does this mean?''' Mays said.
   ``I told her, `Honey, it means only that you are not my
biological daughter and that means nothing in our life. I've loved
you, raised you and cared for you, and that's not going to
change.'''
   Mays said he was relieved the long ordeal is over, but
``shocked, disappointed and let down,'' at the outcome.
   At a news conference Wednesday in his attorney's office, Mays
voice sometimes broke with emotion as he described how Kimberly
seems more withdrawn since hearing the news.
   ``She's a very outgoing, lovable, fun-loving kid. She enjoys
life thoroughly,'' he said. ``I see her spending more time alone
and quiet and not being quite as active and fun-loving as she has
been in the past. She is worried about this.''
   Just before Arlena's death, the Twiggs discovered through
genetic testing she was unrelated to either of them.
   The Twiggs claimed in a federal lawsuit against the hospital
that a swap occurred in the hospital and began a 14-month search
for the child they lost.
   Mays, a roofing contractor, said he would never have agreed to
genetic testing if the Twiggs hadn't signed an agreement in October
promising they wouldn't claim Kimberly as their own.
   The next step is for Kimberly to meet with psychologists who
will make recommendations about a first meeting and subsequent
visitation schedule with the Twiggs, who live in the central
Florida city of Sebring. Mays said he would leave the decision to
the girl.
   Kimberly has always celebrated her birthday on Nov. 29 and won't
change it to Dec. 2 _ the day the Twigg baby was born.
   ``I'm sure if it's left to Kim, she'll celebrate it on both
days,'' Mays said, adding, ``We decided we'd do it on the 29th sort
of as a remembrance to Arlena.''

<HEAD>Group Calls Catastrophic Insurance Repeal a Setback</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's largest senior citizens' group
says repeal of a sweeping Medicare insurance program for
catastrophic illness is a great setback for more than 20 million
Americans.
   ``There are many, many more losers than winners as a result of
repeal and we can't afford to sit around very long before we try to
take this on again because the problem is getting worse,'' said
John Rother, legislative director for the American Association of
Retired Persons.
   But Rother added that the battle over repeal has shown that
efforts to revive the program won't succeed unless a new proposal
spreads the costs over the whole population and includes protection
against long-term care costs.
   Even though long-term care coverage could cost as much as six
times the $10-billion-a-year catastrophic program, ``it may be more
supportable because it would do what they (senior citizens) most
want government to do,'' he said.
   AARP supported the catastrophic program when it was passed last
year and throughout the ensuing outcry for repeal from many older
Americans, including some of its members.
   Once heralded as the biggest improvement in Medicare since its
inception in 1966, the catastrophic illness program will become the
first major new social program to be repealed in recent times.
   Senior citizens who led the revolt said Wednesday that Congress'
repeal of the program was a ``victory for seniors.'' President Bush
is expected to sign the repeal, approved by Congress just before it
adjourned early Wednesday.
   ``Now we hope the Congress will go on and address the nation's
real need, which is taking a good look at our health care system,
including crisis and long-term care,'' said Jack McDavitt, a
spokesman for the National Committee to Preserve Social Security
and Medicare.
   The committee's members were among the leading opponents of the
Medicare expansion, which would have cost higher-income retirees up
to $800 in a special surtax this year. Though the surtax was
repealed, most Medicare recipients will continue to pay a $4
monthly premium.
   Extended hospital coverage that has been available to Medicare
beneficiaries this year would expire at year-end. Limits on
out-of-pocket expenses for doctors' bills and prescription drugs
would die before taking effect. A package of more minor benefits,
including mammograms, home health care and hospice care, also was
eliminated.
   Two provisions, however, would remain: Medicaid improvements for
low-income pregnant women, children and elderly, and protection
from impoverishment for one spouse when the other spouse enters a
nursing home.
   As to the next step, many in Congress and outside government are
awaiting direction from the congressional Pepper Commission, named
after the late Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla., which is studying the
nation's health-care financing and access problems and is due to
report in March. A separate blue-ribbon panel in the Bush
administration is studying the problems, as are officials in the
Department of Health and Human Services.
   ``There's going to be a period of regrouping,'' said Eric
Shulman, legislative director of the National Council of Senior
Citizens, which opposed the hefty surtax but sought to keep some of
the benefits.
   ``There's a growing consensus among employers, workers and
others that we need to move toward a national program,'' Shulman
said.
   ``I wouldn't expect national health care in Bush's first term,
but if he gets on the wrong side of the issue, he may not have a
second term,'' he said.

<HEAD>Study: Low Levels of Carbon Monoxide Bad For the Heart</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Levels of carbon monoxide considered safe by
federal air quality standards can trigger a potentially dangerous
oxygen shortage in the hearts of people with coronary artery
disease, a study today shows.
   Effects were found at carbon monoxide levels equal to those in a
room full of cigarette smokers.
   ``These are definitely adverse health effects,'' said Dr. Thomas
E. Dahms of St. Louis University School of Medicine.
   The study, published in today's New England Journal of Medicine,
found a decrease in the amount of work that people with heart
disease could perform when their carboxyhemoglobin levels _ the
combination of carbon monoxide and hemoglobin _ reached 2 percent.
   Hemoglobin ordinarily combines with oxygen and carries it
throughout the body. But carbon monoxide binds with hemoglobin even
more tightly than oxygen does. So when people breathe carbon
monoxide, it cuts down the amount of oxygen in their blood, and
high doses are fatal.
   The health consequences of very low levels, however, have been
less clear. In general, standards set by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency allow enough carbon monoxide in the air to take
up 2 percent of the blood's hemoglobin.
   ``What we have shown with this paper is that it's beyond any
doubt that there is a documented effect at 2 percent, which frankly
was a surprise to us,'' said Dahms. ``It's such a small amount that
one would not think you could see that kind of change.''
   Federal health surveys have found that 5 percent to 10 percent
of all non-smoking Americans have this much carboxyhemoglobin in
their blood at any time. The two chief sources of carbon monoxide
in the air are cigarette smoke and engine fumes.
   Dahms said a non-smoker in a closed room with 20 smokers would
breathe enough carbon monoxide to have about a 2 percent
carboxyhemoglobin level. Someone who smokes a pack of cigarettes a
day has levels between 4 percent and 8 percent.
   In an accompanying editorial in the journal, Drs. Edward M.
Dwyer Jr. and Gerard M. Turino of St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital
Center in New York said it is difficult to set any safe level of
carbon monoxide.
   ``The safest level would be the lowest level achievable in the
atmosphere,'' they wrote.
   The study was performed on 63 men with coronary artery disease.
They exercised on a treadmill while breathing ordinary air or air
that increased their carboxyhemoglobin levels to 2 percent or 4
percent.
   At 2 percent carbon monoxide levels, they could do 5 percent
less exercise before their hearts showed signs of oxygen
deprivation, and at 4 percent levels, they could do 12 percent less
exercise. They also developed chest pain sooner with increasing
levels of carbon monoxide.
   As people exercise, their hearts demand more oxygen. In people
with healthy hearts, their arteries can expand to deliver more
oxygen-rich blood, and small amounts of carbon monoxide have little
effect.
   But when people have heart disease, clogged arteries don't
expand properly. Carbon monoxide can make an important difference
by lowering the oxygen load of the blood that gets through.

<HEAD>Judge Fines Closed Rayon Manufacturer $6-Plus Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Avtex Fibers Inc. was fined $6.15 million
for polluting the Shenandoah River and ordered to pay to clean the
river of a cancer-causing chemical discharged by its rayon plant.
   Richmond Circuit Judge Theodore J. Markow said the company
probably had been discharging polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs,
into the river since 1983 from its plant in Front Royal, 70 miles
west of Washington, D.C.
   Attorney General Mary Sue Terry said the decision Wednesday
shows that ``respect for the environment is good business in
Virginia.''
   Avtex spokesman Jeff Nelson was out of his office and could not
be reached for comment.
   The company's attorneys told Markow last week that Avtex
couldn't pay fines or cleanup costs because the 50-year-old rayon
plant shut down Nov. 10 under order from the State Water Control
Board. Avtex operates another fiber plant in Pennsylvania.
   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has placed a lien of up
to $40 million on the plant property and the Virginia attorney
general's office has seized saleable items in the plant in case the
company files for bankruptcy.
   Markow acknowledged Avtex's efforts since August to clean up PCB
contamination at the 440-acre plant site, but he chastised the
company for ignoring evidence of PCB spills in 1983 and late 1985.
   He called the pollution ``a public nuisance'' that had damaged
the river significantly. The Virginia Department of Health advised
in May against consuming fish caught from the river near Front
Royal.
   The closure of the plant put 442 employees out of work and
stopped the manufacture of a carbonized yarn used in rocket nozzles
on the space shuttle and nuclear missiles. Government officials
said stockpiles of the yarn would last until a second manufacturer
is approved.
   The judgment included a $3 million fine for discharging PCBs
into the river, plus various fines and penalties for violating
water quality and worker safety regulations.

<HEAD>Pepsi Apologizes for `Cow-Tipping' Remark</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pepsi Cola apologized today to Atlanta residents
for a job recruitment quiz that belittled their city as home to
rustics who prefer fatback to fine dining and get their kicks by
cow-tipping.
   The apology comes in a full-page newspaper advertisement in the
form of an open letter to Atlanta residents. It was signed by Ron
Tidmore, president of Pepsi-Cola South, who described himself as a
native southerner ``angry and embarrassed'' by the characterization.
   The quiz was distributed to business students during a Pepsi
employment recruiting trip to Northwestern University in Evanston,
Ill.
   It was the creation of a young Pepsi employee trying to
demonstrate the relative merits of living and working in Atlanta,
where The Coca-Cola Co. has its headquarters, and Pepsi's corporate
home in the New York City suburb of Purchase, N.Y.
   The quiz asked which city offers ``any food in the world'' and
which has ``fat backs and grits.'' It also asked which city offers
yachting as recreation and which has ``cow tipping,'' the prank of
catching a cow unaware and knocking it over.
   ``We're sorry it happened,'' the ad says. ``Pepsi certainly does
not want to lose your business. But, most important, we do not want
to lose your respect.''
   Neither Pepsi nor The Atlanta Journal would reveal how much the
ad cost.
   Though the quiz offended some, the reference to the obscure
activity of cow tipping has become something of a local joke among
radio call-in show hosts and newspaper columnists in the past week.

   For the eighth time, Charles Manson
disciple Patricia Krenwinkel has been denied parole for her
conviction in the seven Tate-La Bianca killings.
   Krenwinkel, 42, failed to convince a three-member Board of
Prison Terms panel that she no longer poses a threat to society and
that she has changed from the kind of woman she was 20 years ago.
   The board, after deliberating about a half-hour Wednesday, cited
the brutality of the murders in deciding to deny parole. Krenwinkel
may seek parole in another year, the board ruled.
   ``She hasn't changed that much,'' said Los Angeles County Deputy
District Attorney Stephen Kay. ``I think she has ice water running
through her veins.''
   Krenwinkel is serving a life sentence in the California
Institution for Women.
   Krenwinkel was convicted of seven counts of murder and
conspiracy in 1971 for the August 1969 murders of actress Sharon
Tate and four others at her home and for the killings of wealthy
market owner Leno La Bianca and his wife, Rosemary, at their
residence the next night.

<TEXT>
   A prominent Soviet writer has offered an agonized
apology for the ``collective murder'' his country committed when it
sent tanks into Czechoslovakia in 1968.
   In an open letter published in this week's Moscow News, writer
Daniil Granin calls the Soviet move ``illegal, ruinous
intervention'' that brought to power ``dogmatic Stalinists.''
   The Soviet government has declared the 1979 intervention in
Afghanistan a mistake but has yet to renounce the 1968 Warsaw Pact
invasion that crushed the ``Prague Spring'' reform movement in
Czechoslovakia.
   However, Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said last week
the government was still re-evaluating many aspects of past policy
in a ``torturous process.'' And President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has
declared that the Soviet Union has no right to intervene in the
affairs of its Warsaw Pact allies.
   Soviet television recently broadcast an interview with Alexander
Dubcek, who was ousted as Czechoslovak leader for championing the
1968 reform movement.
   But Granin's letter was the first in the Soviet press to openly
denounce the invasion. Its publication in the maverick weekly
appeared to represent his own personal views.
   Granin wrote that he and his friends ``had never felt such shame
for our country, for our party and government,'' as when they heard
the news of the 1968 invasion.
   Czechoslovakia had embarked on its own, early brand of
democratic reform ``and we were the ones to smash and slander this
perestroika. It was collective murder,'' Granin wrote. Gorbachev
has dubbed his reform campaign ``perestroika'', or restructuring.
   Grann said some Soviets did try to speak out against the
invasion, but they lost their jobs, were imprisoned, interned in
psychiatric hospitals or exiled.
   Soviet intellectuals underwent ``suffering for their
helplessness. And most of all, shame, that is, pangs of the
conscience.''
   Even now, Granin said, it is very difficult to get criticism of
the 1968 invasion published, and remarks on the subject were edited
out of a recent article he wrote for a central newspaper.
   Commentators told him to wait until ``it all sorts itself out,''
apparently meaning that either the Czechoslovak or Soviet
government would first have to admit the 1968 invasion was
unjustified.
   Granin said he felt compelled to publish his letter because
``Our conscience hurts: the Berlin Wall, the war in Afghanistan,
Prague, and it is also unclean in the face of our own Soviet
dissidents, who went into prisons and camps.''
   Dubcek has this year broken the silence he was long forced to
keep.
   On Wednesday, he declared his support for the movement for
democratic change that has brought hundreds of thousands of
anti-government protesters into the streets of Prague over the past
six days.
   In a message to demonstrators that was received with wild
cheers, he backed demands for the resignation of Czechoslovak
leaders who took over in 1968 and oversaw a massive purge of party
members.

<TEXT>
   New York City had a white Thanksgiving for the first time in 51
years as snow fell today from the mountains of northwestern North
Carolina to Cleveland to Boston.
   The wintry weather affecting the East Coast and Ohio Valley came
from a storm that developed over Alabama on Wednesday.
   Also Wednesday, strong winds produced snow squalls over parts of
the upper Great Lakes region. Mitchell International Airport in
Milwaukee reported nine inches of snow, while snowfall totals in
northeastern Illinois ranged up to eight inches at Round Lake.
   Temperatures were in the single digits this morning in Wisconsin
and Minnesota.
   The National Weather Service warned of wintry weather today from
North Carolina to parts of Ohio to much of New England.
   Gale warnings extend along the coast of North Carolina and the
Middle Atlantic Coast, as well as off the coast of Maine and New
Hampshire.
   The snow today in the New York City area marked the first white
Thanksgiving there since 1938, when 3.9 inches of snow fell,
establishing a record for Thanksgiving day.
   The storm over the central Gulf Coast states brought rain from
southeastern Texas to northern Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas and
the Middle Atlantic Coast region. Thunderstorms extended from
southeastern Louisiana to northern Georgia.
   Thunderstorms in Mississippi on Wednesday afternoon spun off a
tornado that touched down between Lumberton and Rock Hill,
destroying two homes, damaging 15 houses and barns, and uprooting
numerous trees.
   Dry weather prevailed across the western half of the country,
with fair skies over much of the central and northwestern United
States.
   Temperatures were below freezing Wednesday across the northern
Plains, the upper Mississippi Valley, the Great Lakes and the
northeastern United States. High temperatures were in the teens in
eastern North Dakota and northwestern Minnesota.
   It warmed into the 60s in the Great Basin, and the 70s and lower
80s in Southern California, southern Arizona and south-central
Texas. Temperatures reached the 70s from southern Texas through the
central Gulf Coast region to Florida, southern Georgia and coastal
South Carolina.
   The high for the nation Wednesday was 89 degrees at McAllen,
Texas.

   The Bush administration is backing away from
imposing trade sanctions against Japan in a long-running dispute
over the ability of American companies to compete for construction
work in Japan.
   But U.S. officials are warning the Japanese that more progress
must be made on the issue or the possibility of sanctions could be
raised again.
   In announcing the decision, U.S. Trade Representative Carla
Hills said Wednesday she had determined that Japan had made
``significant progress'' in allowing U.S. companies to compete for
construction jobs.
   ``Firm and measured negotiations have produced results and we
welcome Japan's commitment to improve access to its construction
market,'' she said.
   Separately, U.S. officials in Tokyo said today that a group of
Japanese construction firms has agreed to pay the U.S. government
$32.6 million to settle a dispute over alleged bid-rigging of
projects at the U.S. Navy base at Yokosuka, southwest of Tokyo.
   Representatives from seven Japanese construction firms and
American officials signed the Memorandum of Intent on behalf of 99
Japanese firms, the Justice Department said in a statement.
   The U.S. government alleges 140 Japanese construction and
related firms were involved in the bid-rigging and said the Justice
Department would continue to seek damages from the 41 not covered
by the memorandum.
   Hills could have recommended sanctions that would have
effectively doubled the cost of some Japanese imports to the United
States.
   She said the United States and Japan will continue negotiating
on the construction issue in an effort to remove further
impediments to American companies, and she set a May deadline for
concluding the next round of talks.
   She said the decision not to retaliate was made because the
Japanese have agreed to make greater efforts to discourage bidding
collusion between Japanese companies.
   She also cited commitments by the Japanese to provide more
information to assist potential bidders and to allow open
competition on the architectural design phase of five upcoming
major airport renovation projects in the country.
   While sanctions could still be imposed if Japan does not go
further in opening its markets, Hills refused to say what actions
she might take then.
   ``I don't threaten anyone,'' she said. ``I sit down to
negotiate.''
   U.S. construction, engineering and architecture companies have
long complained about barriers the Japanese have erected that kept
them from obtaining contracts.
   Expansion of trade in services, where the United States is still
considered to have the lead, is considered by many to be the best
hope America has of reducing its huge trade deficit, which is still
running at an annual rate of $100 billion, with Japan accounting
for about half of that amount.
   Hills said construction was an area in which ``we can supply a
better product at a lower price.''
   The review of Japanese construction practices was mandated by
Congress in the 1988 trade law, which gave the administration one
year to review the issue and decide whether to retaliate.
   The administration is conducting several other negotiations with
Japan, all aimed at reducing the huge trade imbalance between the
two countries.
   On another matter, Hills said she was optimistic that the United
States would achieve many of its objectives in worldwide trade
talks being held with 97 other nations under the auspices of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   Known as the Uruguay Round, the trade talks are scheduled to
conclude at the end of 1990.
   Hills told reporters during a briefing that she hoped to reach
agreement on some less contentious aspects of the talks by next
summer, clearing the way for debate in the final months over such
sensitive issues as the U.S. demand for scrapping costly farm
subsidies.

   Chief Warrant Officer Leonard Rizzuto
likes to be out front when trouble hits and that's where he was
when a training jet crashed into the USS Lexington.
   Rizzuto, who acts as the ship's fire chief, was among 23 sailors
decorated Wednesday for heroism and exceptional performance in
fighting fires and aiding injured shipmates when a T-2 Buckeye
slammed into the aircraft carrier Oct. 29, killing the student
pilot and four people on the flight deck.
   ``My theory is that in order for my people to follow me I have
to be out front,'' said the sailor from Brooklyn, N.Y., after the
ceremony on the ship's hangar deck. ``That was my position, to give
guidance and direction to ensure that my procedures were being
followed.''
   They are procedures Rizzuto has had to put to the test before.
He has fought fires aboard three other aircraft carriers, including
a blaze that killed 134 sailors on the USS Forrestal off the coast
of Vietnam in 1967.
   Rizzuto and two other crew members, Lt. Neal R. Miller of
Syracuse, N.Y., and Petty Officer 2nd Class Adrian Turner of
Memphis, Tenn., received Navy Commendation medals. Navy Achievement
medals were given to 20 other sailors.
   Vice Adm. John Disher, chief of naval education and training
said the Navy, and the Lexington in particular, have enviable
safety records, despite the focus on a recent series of accidents
in the service.
   Miller, the catapult launch officer stationed near the front of
the ship, was cited for leading a hose team that fought the main
fire. He then followed up by going below deck into a smoke-filled
area to spray a fire-smothering chemical on flames coming from
fuel-soaked insulation.
   Turner, a crash and salvage specialist, Rizzuto's chief
assistant, was stationed on the forward part of the flight deck.
   He said he first ran to get out of the way of flaming debris,
then grabbed a hose.
   ``When other people started to arrive I dispersed people to
different jobs to get them moving and attack the fire,'' Turner
said.

   Police blocked about 50 people
from marching on a courthouse today to protest the trial of 14
alleged African National Congress members who have accused police
of torture.
   Police arrested journalists, including a television crew of the
government-run South African Broadcasting Corp., and many of the
demonstrators as they marched toward the Cape Town Supreme Court
from a Methodist church on the central Greenmarket Square.
   Earlier, police blocked an attempted march from the square to
the courthouse, 1,500 feet away, by about 30 Moslem women.
   Placards saying, ``Release our comrades,'' and referring to a
security policeman as a torturer, were confiscated.
   The 14 defendants have been accused of a series of bombings on
behalf of the outlawed ANC guerrilla movement. The defendants have
testified that police tortured them while in custody.
   Protest organizers said the demonstration was part of a new,
national, anti-apartheid defiance campaign. The campaign is to
focus on what government opponents see as political trials and the
execution of political prisoners.
   In August, opposition groups began defying restrictions and held
rallies and marches to protest segregated beaches, hospitals,
schools, buses and other facilities.
   President F.W. de Klerk last week declared all beaches open to
all races and called for the repeal of the Separate Amenities Act,
which allows segregation of most public facilities. However,
housing, schools and hospitals are not covered by the act and will
remain segregated.
   On Wednesday, about 140 members of the National Association of
Democratic Lawyers held placards on the steps outside the
Johannesburg Supreme Court to protest the death penalty. South
Africa has one of world's highest rates for executions.
   Police did not interfere with the protest.

   A Marine helicopter crashed and sank off the
coast of Spain and a search continued today for the two crew
members aboard, a Navy spokesman said.
   The AH-IT Cobra was operating from the helicopter carrier USS
Iwo Jima in the western Mediterranean when the crash occurred at
2:21 p.m. EST Wednesday, said Lt. Joe Quimby.
   The Iwo Jima was conducting routine flight operations at the
time of the crash, Quimby said.
   The aircraft's squadron is based at the Marine Corps Station in
New River, N.C., and is part of the 24th Marine Expedition Unit
currently deployed with the U.S. Sixth Fleet, Quimby said.
   Extensive sea and air rescue operations continued throughout the
night and are ongoing, Quimby said.
   The names of the pilot and co-pilot are being withheld pending
results of the search and notification of next of kin, he said. An
investigation will be held to determine the cause of the crash, he
said.

   A district court today acquitted
prominent Czech dissident Jan Carnogursky of sedition and
subversion charges but kept him in prison pending an appeal by the
prosecution, a human rights group said.
   The verdict was a victory for pro-democracy demonstrators who
had gathered outside the court in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia, to
support Carnogursky and to join other protesters nationwide calling
for poltical reforms.
   Carnogursky, a trained lawyer barred from practice, was quoted
as telling the court that it cannot be subversive to tell the truth
and that his activities were Christian in character rather than
political.
   The judge accepted the request of the prosecution not to release
Carnogursky while the prosecuter's appeal is pending, the
Vienna-based International Helsinki Federation said in a statement.
   Carnogursky, a Roman Catholic activist and human rights
campaigner, was tried on charges of sedition and subversion for an
article he wrote for a Bratislava underground monthly and for a
statement he and four other activists signed in August. The
statement called on Slovaks to mark the 21st anniversary of the
1968 Warsaw Pact invasion that crushed the Prague Spring reform
movement in Czechoslovakia by laying flowers in memory of the
invasion's victims.
   Carnogursky was detained Aug. 14 together with those four
leading Slovak activists: Miroslav Kusy, Hana Ponicka, Anton
Selecky and Vladimir Manak.
   Kusy got an eight-month suspended sentence after a court last
week found him guilty of ``harming state interests abroad.''
   Ponicka, Selecky and Manak, who were charged with sedition
together with Carnogursky, were acquitted by the court.
   Gerald Nagler, secretary general of the International Helsinki
Federation, who attended Carnogursky's two-day trial, said the
judge treated the case with a ``purely legal approach, disregarding
any political argumentation.''
   ``The fact that, on one hand, the trial was carried out in a
non-political way unheard of in Czechoslovakia and that, on the
other hand, Carnogursky was not released after having been
acquitted, reflects the present situation of confusion in
Czecholsovakia,'' Nagler said.
   For the first time in years, Alexander Dubcek, the leader of the
crushed Prague Spring movement, was able to attend part of the
trial in Bratislava. Czechoslovak state television, in a departure
from longtime pratice, briefly showed Dubcek, who has generally
kept a low profile since 1968.
   Outside the Palace of Justice on Wednesday, where the
Carnogursky trial took place, Dubcek briefly addressed a crowd of
several hundred people taking advantage of the fast-moving
developments in Czechoslovakia marked by mass pro-democracy
protests throughout the nation.
   Dubcek, who was cheered by the crowd, said he agreed with them
that the charges against Carnogursky were unfair, witnesses
reported.

<HEAD>Senior Tories Appeal for Unity Around Thatcher</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCUS ELIASON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senior Conservatives are rallying around Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher to fend off an unprecedented challenge
to her leadership of the party.
   Deputy Prime Minister Sir Geoffrey Howe, in an appeal for party
unity today, joined party Chairman Kenneth Baker and Tory elder
statesman Lord Whitelaw in denouncing attempts to unseat her.
   They were reacting to an announcement Wednesday by a
rank-and-file lawmaker, Sir Anthony Meyer, that he will challenge
Mrs. Thatcher for the leadership when she comes up for her annual
re-election.
   Meyer conceded he was an outsider with no chance of defeating
Mrs. Thatcher but said he would go ahead with his candidacy unless
a higher-profile nominee emerged.
   No Tory has ever run against Mrs. Thatcher since she became
party leader 14 years ago. But lately, economic troubles, her
prickly personality and her resistance to deeper British
integration into the European Economic Community have stirred
dissent in the party.
   Party rules require the leadership election to be held by Dec.
19. The complex procedure means Mrs. Thatcher must win the votes of
at least 57 percent of the 374 Tories in the House of Commons to
win outright.
   Meyer said he hoped to provoke sufficient abstentions to send
Mrs. Thatcher a message of disenchantment and possibly lure a major
challenger into the race if it goes to a second round of voting.
   Howe and Baker are regarded as possible Thatcher successors, but
both made clear their distaste for a contest.
   The leading contender, former Defense Secretary Michael
Heseltine, said he would take no part in a challenge to Mrs.
Thatcher.
   In a statement, Howe said: ``I urge any parliamentary colleague
who might be thinking of forcing the party into a leadership
election not to do so.''
   He said it was ``crucial to maintain continuity of policy and
authority as well as unity of purpose.''
   A leadership challenge ``would give an unwarranted boost to our
opponents,'' and would ``play into the hands of a section of the
media who have been trying to engineer a leadership crisis.''
   ``There is no such crisis. The prime minister commands the
overwhelming support of the party in Parliament and in the
country,'' Howe said.
   Lord Whitelaw, a former Thatcher deputy, told parliamentary
correspondents Wednesday that he wanted to see the Conservatives
stay in power under Mrs. Thatcher at the next election, which must
be held by mid-1992.
   Baker, the party chairman, was quoted in an interview with the
Financial Times as calling Meyer's challenge ``an irrelevant
distraction,'' and urging Tory members to end their ``gossip, rumor
and intrigues'' and close ranks around Mrs. Thatcher.
   Baker was quoted as saying that from his contacts with thousands
of party activists in recent weeks, ``The message is very, very
clear... there is overwhelming support for Margaret Thatcher.''
   The Financial Times said party whips were nonetheless assuming
the contest would go ahead and were preparing to put intense
pressure on wavering lawmakers to support Mrs. Thatcher.
   It said the challenge appeared to be coming from the party left
with a view toward mounting a more serious challenge next year.
   The left opposes Mrs. Thatcher's hard-line, free-market reforms
and her perceived hostility to the EEC but was in limbo as long as
her policies seemed successful. Now that inflation is above 7
percent and interest rates are at an eight-year high of 15 percent,
the dissenters are resurfacing.

   The Navy has proposed deploying a flotilla of
warships off Colombia to deter drug traffickers, a newspaper
reported today.
   The ships would provide a base in the Caribbean for troops and
aircraft to intercept airborne and oceangoing drug traffickers
starting next year, said the Los Angeles Times, citing unidentified
Bush administration officials.
   The proposal was presented to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney late
last week and to representatives of federal anti-drug agencies
Tuesday, the Times said.
   One unidentified Pentagon official said the defense secretary's
reaction was ``pretty positive.'' Another administration official
said, ``It's a done deal,'' according to the report.
   Under the plan, the Navy would operate an aircraft carrier
battle group or a marine amphibious task force off Colombia. Each
group would be in position for one or two months, similar to
training deployments.
   It was unclear whether the aircraft, their carriers or assigned
amphibious assault ships would be allowed to chase suspected drug
traffickers into Colombian territory.

   Eastern Airlines pilots are calling off their
sympathy strike and offering to return to work, dealing a stunning
blow to Machinists on strike against the carrier since March.
   The air line's flight attendants also voted to end their walkout.
   The leaders of Eastern's union pilots voted Wednesday to end
their walkout, although it remained unclear whether Eastern would
welcome back all of the more than 2,200 pilots still on strike.
   The decision by the Air Line Pilots' Association instantly
crushed the solidarity of the strike begun by the Machinists and
until now supported by the pilots and union flight attendants.
   On Wednesday, Local 553 Transport Workers of America informed
Easter Airlines of the union's immediate and unconditional return
to work.
   ``This was a very difficult decision, but one made in the best
interests of the flight attendants,'' said Mary Jane Barry,
president of TWU Local 553.
   The Machinists vowed to continue their walkout.
   ``We're not calling this thing off,'' said union vice president
John Peterpaul. Calls to the flight attendants' union were not
returned, but the attendants traditionally have honored Machinists
picket lines even when pilots have crossed them.
   The 20-member Master Executive Council of the Eastern pilots'
group said President Bush's veto of legislation establishing a
special congressional panel to propose a solution to the strike
convinced the pilots there was no end to the strike in sight and
that returning to work was the best way to protect their jobs.
   ``It's a very interesting development,'' Miami-based Eastern
said in a statement. ``Our only regret is that it didn't come
earlier and we could have avoided all the trauma that has come to
Eastern Airlines.''
   There currently are no openings for pilots at the airline, which
now has about 1,800 fliers, the company said. But it indicated
there could be slots in the future, which would be filled in the
order in which pilots returned to work _ except in cases where
pilots with experience on specific types of aircraft are needed.
   Eastern said striking pilots ``will be recalled as jobs come
open in the future'' and invited them to sign the recall list.
   Eastern has been hiring replacement pilots and using several
hundred union pilots who crossed picket lines. The airline has been
planning to reorganize as a carrier about 85 percent of its former
size.
   ``They've got all the pilots they need,'' Paul Karos, an airline
analyst at First Boston Corp., said Wednesday. ``The strike has
been mainly symbolic.''
   Technically, under the Railway Labor Act which governs airline
contract disputes, only the Machinists are involved in a
full-fledged strike. The pilots and Eastern's union flight
attendants have been honoring Machinist pickets in legal sympathy
strikes.
   The Machinists went on strike after refusing to agree to a
demand for $150 million in concessions on wages, work rules and
other issues sought by Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent
company, Texas Air Corp. The Machinists said later they would agree
to similar or greater concessions if Lorenzo would sell Eastern,
but sale attempts have fallen through.
   The pilots' union has a history of crossing the picket lines of
other unions, limiting the effectiveness of airline strikes. But it
stood with the Machinists until Wednesday, giving organized labor
an important boost even though in recent months Eastern has been
able to expand operations with replacements.
   Duke Jack, spokesman for the local ALPA branch, said Bush's veto
was the final straw in leading the pilots to drop the strike.
   ``President Bush at the eleventh hour decided working people
weren't that important in his 1,000 points of light. When he vetoed
that (the resolution) we took a look around and said we didn't have
anywhere else to go,'' he said.
   The decision to end the strike was announced by Skip Copeland,
who in August replaced Jack Bavis as head of the Eastern pilots
after Bavis advocated returning to work.
   Copeland said the pilots have been instructed to contact the
company about returning to work.
   ``The time has come now to go back, rebuild Eastern and get on
with our lives and professions,'' Copeland said.
   But Don Hanson, an 11-year Machinist and who was picketing
outside Miami airport on Wednesday, said, ``As long as Frank
Lorenzo is at the helm, I'll never go back to work. There's no
future with the man. The man doesn't treat his people right.''

   Israeli troops killed one
Palestinian during a raid in the West Bank today, and two other
Palestinians were killed by fellow Arabs, one for allegedly
collaborating with Israeli officials.
   In Nablus, residents said Haniya Swissa, 35, was walking through
the central market when she was approached by an Arab man with a
gun and asked if her name was Swissa. When she said ``yes,'' the
man shot her, they said.
   Following the shooting, seven masked Palestinians marched around
the market with a loudspeaker announcing that she was killed for
helping the Israelis, Arab reports said.
   Also in Nablus, an Arab suspected of collaborating with Israel
opened fire after his car was stoned. Arab reports said Ferial
Abdel Nabi, 35, was hit. She died later at Nablus' Rafidiya
Hospital.
   Also today, soldiers opened fire during a raid on the village of
Beit Umrin near Nablus, killing a Palestinian. He was identified by
Arab reporters as Mouhi Ghazi Hassoun, 21.
   The army confirmed the three deaths and said police were
investigating the two cases involving suspected collaborators.
   The badly burned body of a Palestinian found a day earlier in a
dump in the West Bank town of Ramallah was identified by police as
Hussein Akila, 45.
   Arab reports said Akila, who was stabbed before the body was set
alight, was suspected of assisting Israeli security services.
   The death in Beit Umrin raised to 616 the number of Palestinians
killed by Israelis since the Palestinian uprising against Israeli
occupation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip began 23 months ago.
   At least 150 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs, most
on suspicion of collaborating. Forty-two Israelis have died in the
violence.

   The Election Commission today ordered a
revote in more than 600 polling stations across the country amid
charges of assaults, intimidation and fraud in national
parliamentary elections.
   At least 40 people were killed in violence during Wednesday's
balloting, the first of three days of general elections. The
Congress Party of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and the opposition
National Front accused each other of rigging votes and instigating
the fighting.
   Election Commissioner R.V.S. Peri Sastri said complaints of
fraud and violence had been received ``from almost all'' the 221
constituencies which went to the polls Wednesday.
   He said a repoll had been ordered in 636 of the estimated
150,000 polling booths, and inquiries into allegations in other
areas were continuing. These, he said, included the Amethi
constituency in Uttar Pradesh state, where Gandhi is seeking
re-election. ``We will withhold the result from Amethi until the
inquiry is completed,'' he said.
   The National Front, a loose coalition of opposition parties, has
accused Congress of widespread vote fraud and attempted murder in
Amethi and demanded a repoll.
   L.C. Jain, the campaign manager of opposition candidate Raj
Mohan Gandhi, told reporters that Congress Party ``goons, hoodlums
and gangsters took over polling booths'' in the constituency and
stuffed ballot boxes.
   Raj Mohan Gandhi, no relative of the Prime Minister, was not
present at the news conference because he was at the bedside of
Sanjay Singh, a local opposition leader who was shot and seriously
wounded by Congress gunmen, Jain said.
   Singh, whose wife is a niece of National Front leader Vishwanath
Pratap Singh, was in the intensive care unit of a hospital in
Lucknow, the state capital, and doctors said he was in critical
condition. He was given a large blood transfusion and was still
unconscious, they said.
   ``The very fact that the Congress is bent upon ... violence
shows that they are losing the elections,'' said Arun Nehru,
Gandhi's estranged cousin and a leader of the opposition front.
   Gandhi faces the most cohesive election challenge ever mounted
by opposition parties during the current elections.
   Five opposition parties have overcome their differences and
melded themselves into the National Front to oppose Gandhi. In the
face of the rare opposition unity, the Congress Party is in serious
trouble and might even lose, opinion polls say.
   ``The Congress violence in Amethi is an example of blatant
rigging and the worst type of criminal act,'' Nehru told reporters
in Lucknow.
   Congress Party spokesman Anand Sharma said the demand for a
revote in Amethi was ``a conspiracy to constitute Parliament minus
Rajiv Gandhi.'' He told reporters, ``It would play right into the
hands of the conspirators.''
   The pro-government National Herald newspaper also blamed
Wednesday's violence on the National Front and said, ``They will
find themselves sadly mistaken if they think that musclemanship can
bring them political dividends in the election.''
   On Wednesday, 15 of the country's 25 states and five of its 7
federally ruled territories voted. Other regions vote Friday and
Sunday.
   At stake are 524 of the 543 seats in the Lok Sabha, or House of
the People, Parliament's policy-making lower house. Several
contests were postponed because of incomplete voter rolls and
candidates' deaths.
   At least three candidates, all independents, were among the 84
people killed in campaign violence since the elections were
announced Oct. 17. Most of the other victims were party workers,
election officials and voters.
   Gandhi and his Congress Party are the main issues in the
campaign.
   There are few major distinctions between the campaign platforms
of the Congress and the National Front, except for the National
Front's plank to oust Congress for alleged corruption and
ineptitude.
   The Congress Party has sought to portray the election as a
choice between stability and chaos, maintaining that the
opposition's new-found unity will shatter if it is voted into power.

   Romanian Communists today praised
Nicolae Ceausescu as a hero, and officials said no one will oppose
the re-election of the leader who has denounced the changes
sweeping the rest of the East bloc.
   Ceausescu, 71, the longest-serving party leader in Eastern
Europe, and his wife Elena _ the No. 2 official in the nation _
left their seats soon after the 14th Communist Party Congress
convened for a fourth day today, but hundreds of delegates chanted
and applauded in support of them.
   In a speech opening the congress Monday, Ceausescu rejected the
reforms gripping all six other Warsaw Pact nations and proclaimed a
strengthened role instead for his ruling Communist Party, which he
has led since 1965.
   Expressing scorn for the political liberalization transforming
allied Soviet bloc parties and countries, Ceausescu hinted that
reformist Communist leaders elsewhere had betrayed their people.
   Politburo member Emil Bobu _ No. 3 in the chain of command _ led
the praise today, lauding the ``brilliant report submitted to
congress'' by Ceausescu. Bobu said Ceausescu's speech made a
``great contribution'' to the process of scientific socialism, the
formal name for Romania's brand of communism.
   Ceausescu's intolerance of opposition to his concepts had led to
the most suppressive atmosphere within the Soviet bloc even before
the onset of changes elsewhere.
   Delegate Ion Dodu Balan, a writer, described Ceausescu as ``an
ardent patriot and revolutionary, a hero of the nation ...
dilligent, brave and righteous.''
   Delegates chosen by congress organizers to speak to reporters
also rejected reforms of the kind sweeping Czechoslovakia and
Bulgaria, bringing hundreds of thousands to the streets.
   ``We know what's going on in Bulgaria, that's abnormal,'' said
delegate Mihacea Tasca. ``Also in Czechoslovakia ... But things
like that shouldn't happen here.''
   The re-election of Ceausescu will probably take place Friday by
members of the newly picked policy-setting Central Committee, said
officials on condition of anonymity.
   Ceausescu is the only candidate, and the officials suggested his
re-election for another five years was likely to be unanimous.
   ``There is nobody foolish enough to oppose him,'' said one
official.

   Roberto Arias, a former Panamanian
ambassador and the husband of British ballet dancer Margot Fonteyn,
has died, sources close to the family said today. He was 72.
   Arias had been partially paralyzed since a political opponent
shot him in 1964. He died of heart failure Wednesday, a day after
surgery for cancer, the sources said.
   A law graduate of Cambridge University and the son and nephew of
Panamanian presidents, Arias was ambassador to the United Nations
and to England.
   In 1964, he was a member of the legislative assembly, the
country's congress. He owned the newspaper La Hora and was director
of the daily Panama America, which are no longer published.
   Arias married Ms. Fonteyn, a dame commander of the British
Empire, in 1954. Since 1981, they had lived on a 500-acre cattle
farm on the Pacific Ocean near the village of El Higo, 60 miles
southwest of Panama City.
   Since retiring in 1979 at the age of 60, Dame Margot has helped
care for the farm and has advised the National Ballet Company of
Panama.
   Arias has four children by a previous marriage.

   President Bush, in a Thanksgiving message
previewing the superpower summit, is urging Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev to help ``bring down the last barriers to a
new world of freedom'' and end the Cold War.
   In a televised speech to the nation, Bush on Wednesday night
offered a ``new partnership'' with the Soviets, while at the same
time cautioning that ``a time of historic change is no time for
recklessness.''
   Thus, he said, he will act with prudence when he meets on
shipboard with Gorbachev in the Mediterranean next week.
   ``I want President Gorbachev to know exactly where the United
States stands. Let me be clear _ America stands with freedom and
democracy,'' Bush said, lauding the moves toward reform in Germany,
Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Bulgaria.
   ``We welcome the appeal of the president to use this meeting in
order to break out of the boundaries of the policy of containment''
Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov told a news
briefing today.
   ``We are concluding the period of development after World War II
and coming to broad and open cooperation,'' Gerasimov added.
   Bush delivered the Thanksgiving-eve address from the
presidential retreat at Camp David, Md., where he and his wife
Barbara are spending the holiday with family members and friends.
   Offering a look at his agenda for their Dec. 2-3 meeting off the
coast of Malta, Bush said he and Gorbachev will ``begin the work of
years.''
   He said he would seek Gorbachev's assurance that the process of
reform will continue in Eastern Europe. ``And we will give him our
assurance that America welcomes reform not as an adversary seeking
advantage, but as a people offering support.''
   ``The peace we are building must be different than the hard,
joyless peace between two armed camps we've known so long,'' Bush
said. ``The historic task before us now is to begin the healing of
this old wound.''
   He called Gorbachev ``the dynamic architect of Soviet reform.''
He said he would tell the Soviet leader ``that America wants the
people of the Soviet Union to fulfill their destiny. And I will
assure him that there is no greater advocate of perestroika than
the president of the United States.'' Perestroika is Gorbachev's
policy of restructuring for his country's ailing economy.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, interviewed on CNN after the
speech, said that in the past Bush appeared ``perhaps too detached
and too calm, too relaxed about things that are truly exciting.''
   ``But,'' he added, ``I think that ... Democrats now expect the
president to approach these historic issues with determination and
prudence.''
   Foley, D-Wash., called Bush's speech a ``fine and eloquent
address, one that every American can wholeheartedly agree with.''
   On Friday, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher will visit
Bush at Camp David. The president told reporters earlier Wednesday
he will consult with her on the upcoming U.S.-Soviet summit.
   ``On other Thanksgivings, the world was haunted by the images of
watchtowers, guard dogs and machine guns,'' Bush said in his speech
to the nation. ``But now the world has a new image _ reflecting a
new reality _ that of Germans, east and west, pulling each other to
the top of the wall, a human bridge between nations.''
   ``This is not the end of the book of history, but it is a joyful
end of one of history's saddest chapters.''
   Looking ahead to the summit, he said, ``I am reaching out to
President Gorbachev, asking him to work with me to bring down the
last barriers to a new world of freedom.''
   ``Let us move beyond containment, and once and for all end cold
war.''
   Bush offered assurances that he and the Soviet leader would not
mastermind a superpower plan for Europe _ ``after all, the peoples
of Europe are determining their own future.'' He added, however,
``Though there will be no surprises sprung on our allies, we will
miss no opportunity to expand freedom and enhance the peace.''
   The president answered in advance a possible Soviet move to
remove all U.S. and Soviet troops from Europe. He stated he would
entertain no such notion, although reductions in U.S. forces in
Europe are a plausible goal.
   When he meets with allied leaders in Brussels after he sees
Gorbachev, Bush said, ``I will assure them that no matter how
dramatic the change in Eastern Europe, or in the Soviet Union
itself, the United States will continue to stand with our allies
and our friends.''
   Bush reiterated administration statements that he will not
attempt an arms control agreement at the Malta summit, and that he
will press Gorbachev on using its influence with the leftist
government of Nicaragua.

<HEAD>Military Leader Rejects Political Pluralism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior military official said
today the army is opposed to ending one-party rule in Communist
Yugoslavia because it could aggravate nationalistic problems in the
country.
   Adm. Petar Simic, who heads the influential Communist Party
organization within the armed forces, said at a key conference of
the body that the introduction of Western-style democracy would
``further enhance a nationalistic split within Yugoslavia.''
   His comments, carried by the state Tanjug news agency, followed
growing calls from some parts of Yugoslavia for introduction of a
pluralistic system to solve the country's economic and political
problems.
   Hungary and Poland have moved away from one-party rule, and
there are increased calls in East Germany and Czechoslovakia for an
end to the Communist Party's monopoly on power there.
   ``We do not see the future of our country in the restoration of
the (Western-style) parliamentarian system,'' Simic reportedly told
the conference, which was called to prepare the army's political
platform for a Communist Party congress in January.
   Officials opposing the introduction of Western-style democracy
in Yugoslavia believe the ensuing political parties would be formed
along ethnic lines and could trigger a civil war in this country of
numerous nationalities.
   Communist leaders from Yugoslavia's largest republic of Serbia
favor the Communist Party's continued monopoly on power, while
liberals in the northern republic of Slovenia advocate introduction
of a multiparty political system.
   With the two factions within the country's leadership unable to
agree on meaningful ways of revamping the economic and political
system, many Yugoslavs fear the country could splinter under the
strain.
   The annual inflation rate stands at 1,500 percent. Unemployment
in 1988 was at 15 percent, and the foreign debt was $21 billion in
mid-1989. The living standard has been in steep decline since 1980.
   Economic problems have been accompanied by a resurgence of
historic ethnic rivalries in Yugoslavia, a loose federation of six
republics and two autonomous provinces.
   Much of the unrest has centered on the province of Kosovo, where
ethnic Albanians form a majority of more than 90 percent and have
clashed with the Serb minority, which wants greater control over
the province.
   Until recently, the military had remained on the sidelines of
political conflicts in Yugoslavia, but senior officers now show
signs of increasing unease over the problems.

   Images of families still struggling after the ravages of the
California earthquake and Hurricane Hugo in the Carolinas brought
new meaning this year to the day Americans feast and give thanks
for the nation's plenty.
   While millions sat down to turkey dinners at home, many others
celebrated the holiday by sharing with the less fortunate: the
thousands trying to get back on their feet after natural disasters,
the homeless in the cities, and the destitute overseas.
   In New York City, the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade stepped off
this morning despite the first significant Thanksgiving snowfall in
51 years and high winds that grounded the Snoopy and Bugs Bunny
balloons.
   ``It's a white Thanksgiving!'' cheered parade watcher Nora
Deledansky, 12.
   Around Charleston, S.C., where shattered homes still bear
witness to the hurricane that killed 29 people Sept. 21 and 22,
volunteers will serve up 5,000 turkey dinners at 13 sites for
hurricane victims.
   ``We got a lot to be thankful for,'' said Charleston City
Councilman Robert Ford, who represents many of the city's poorer
areas. ``Everything we lost in Charleston was mostly material
anyway. People should be grateful for the fact that they have their
lives and health and well-being.''
   Besides the dinners sponsored by the Red Cross and the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, churches planned
to deliver turkeys and hams to hurricane victims.
   On the Isle of Palms, where nearly every house was leveled or
damaged by Hugo's 135 mph wind, officials invited about three dozen
residents, police officers and firefighters for a Thanksgiving
dinner.
   In San Francisco, the annual Thanksgiving meal for 6,000
homeless people at Glide Memorial Church took on new significance.
The earthquake that killed 67 and did $7 billion in damage Oct. 17
deepened the plight of the homeless by toppling or damaging the
cheap hotels where many take shelter.
   The Rev. Cecil Williams, pastor of the church in the city's
run-down Tenderloin district, recalled that hundreds volunteered to
help the homeless after the quake.
   ``We have all been through a major earthquake and we have
survived. We have much to be thankful for,'' Williams said. ``Most
of all, we have a community of people who have been helping each
other and we are going to celebrate that spirit of giving and
volunteering.''
   Across the country, the homeless were invited to Thanksgiving
meals at churches and shelters.
   Members of Indiana Lions clubs chose Thanksgiving to share
America's plenty with the poor of Guatemala. About 50 Lions set out
today in a caravan of 16 used ambulances they will donate to the
Central American country, along with 12,000 pairs of used
eyeglasses, 15,000 articles of clothing and assorted medical
supplies and toys.
   At home, families settled down to their turkeys _ 45 million
birds, according to the National Turkey Federation _ and a
television diet of parades and football, including two National
Football League games.
   Snow was falling today in the Northeast, while a storm was
developing over the central Gulf Coast states. Snow fell Wednesday
in the Great Lakes region and parts of the upper Midwest and the
Plains.
   The wintry cold and snow weren't expected to deter huge crowds
drawn to New York City's annual parade, also seen on television by
an estimated 55 million people. Macy's extravaganza of marching
bands and helium-filled characters is one of many parades around
the country that inaugurate the Christmas shopping season.
   President Bush, who used the holiday to rejoice at the changes
sweeping Eastern Europe, planned Thanksgiving dinner at Camp David,
Md. On the menu: roast turkey with stuffing, cranberry sauce, sweet
potatoes with marshmallows, green beans, salad and pumpkin and
pecan pies.
   For long-haul truckers forced to spend the holiday on the
highways, truck stops across the country were cooking up home-style
meals to serve free. The 39-outlet Truckstops of America chain
doesn't charge for Thanksgiving meals, said Gary Ryan, restaurant
manager at the company's Cleveland headquarters.
   In Newark, N.J., hundreds of families offered holiday shelter
for 200 people left homeless by fires that destroyed an apartment
building and two dozen houses on Tuesday.
   All of the homeless have found temporary quarters, either in
private homes or in motels arranged by the Red Cross, and they all
are invited to Thanksgiving dinner at the Lighthouse Community
Center, said Mayor Sharpe James.
   In Hammond, Ind., one judge wants to make sure holiday drinking
doesn't add to weather hazards on the road. Municipal Judge Peter
Katic ordered bond for those arrested for drunken driving doubled,
to $1,500 for state residents and $2,000 for out-of-staters, to
ensure drinkers spend the long weekend in jail.

   Flags flew at half staff, church bells
tolled and a general strike brought life to a standstill in
Syrian-policed regions of Lebanon today in mourning for slain
President Rene Mouawad.
   Speaker Hussein Husseini, a Shiite Moslem, moved swiftly to try
to convene Parliament in north Lebanon to elect a new president and
rescue an Arab-brokered peace plan to end 14 years of civil war.
   Forty-three legislators left Moslem west Beirut by car for
Zgorta, Mouawad's hometown in the Syrian-policed north, to pay
condolences to his family and to be on hand for the election.
   A quorum of 48 deputies, or two-thirds of the 72 surviving
legislators, is required to convene and elect a head of state.
   The late president was to be buried in Zgorta on Saturday.
   Druse chieftain Walid Jumblatt and Shiite Moslem leader Nabih
Berri said in Damascus, Syria, that a new president must be chosen
quickly.
   ``Unless we elect a new president within 24 hours or at the most
a very few days, we shall enter a period of hell,'' Jumblatt told
an impromptu news conference in the Syrian capital.
   The bomb that killed Mouawad and 23 other people was detonated
by remote control as the 64-year-old Maronite Catholic president's
motorcade drove down a west Beirut boulevard on Wednesday.
   The killing raised fears in Lebanon's war-weary population of
renewed hostilities pitting troops of Christian army commander Gen.
Michel Aoun against Syrian and allied Moslem forces.
   Police said thousands of people were evacuating Beirut's Moslem
and Christian sectors to safer areas in the south, the eastern
Bekaa Valley and the north-eastern mountains.
   No one claimed responsibility for the assassination.
   In further reaction today to the killing, aSoviet government
spokesman labeled the assassination ``political terror.'' Foreign
Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said Moscow hoped the
warring groups in Lebanon would ``show a sense of national
responsibility at this difficult moment.''
   Pope John Paul II sent a telegram to the Maronite Christian
patriarch, Nasrallah Pierre Sfeir. ``Once again violence and hate
have bloodied the land of Lebanon,'' the pontiff said.
   Syria's Moslem and leftist allies in Lebanon accused Aoun's army
of carrying out the killing. Aoun issued a statement denouncing it
as a ``loathsome crime.''
   Mouawad was elected by Parliament in Syrian-policed northern
Lebanon Nov. 5 with a mandate to supervise implementation of an
Arab league-brokered peace plan to end Lebanon's 14-year civil war.
   Aoun refused to recognize Mouawad's election and accused
Parliament of selling out to Syria by accepting a peace plan that
did not set a timetable for the withdrawal of the 40,000 troops
Syria maintains in the country.
   The state-run news media of Iraq, which supplies Aoun with arms,
accused Syria and Iran of murdering Mouawad. Syria earlier issued a
statement condemning the killing and blaming it on ``the hand of
betrayal and treason.''
   Government offices, banks, schools, shops and other businesses
closed to abide by the strike call as all radio stations broadcast
classical music in mourning for the Christian president, who was
killed on the 46th anniversary of Lebanon's independence.
   Employees at Beirut international airport observed a two-hour
strike that was ending at noon. But employees of the Beirut
municipality's road maintenance department were not on strike.
   Dozens of workers operating cranes and bulldozers were removing
the piles of twisted metal and the gutted wreckage of several cars
from the boulevard where the bomb explosion killed Mouawad.
   The strike, called by various leftist and Moslem factions, was
not observed in the 310-square-mile Christian enclave, most of
which is controlled by Aoun's troops.
   Schools were open in the Christian enclave but very few students
showed up for class because parents were worried about the
possibility of renewed violence, a local reporter said.
   An official statement said Mouawad's body would be taken to his
hometown of Zgorta, 45 miles from Beirut in north Lebanon later in
the day. He will be buried Saturday.
   The National Front alliance of Syrian-backed militias blamed the
assassination on Aoun, who fought a six-month battle against Syrian
troops until a September cease-fire. Aoun had rejected Mouawad's
election as unconstitutional.
   But the Iraqi state-owned newspaper Al Thawra blamed the killing
of Mouawad on Syria and Iran, saying: ``They are behind the
assassination of Mouawad.''
   Iraq and Syria are bitter enemies, ruled by rival factions of
the Arab Baath Socialist Party.
   Lebanon had been without a president since September 1988, when
Amin Gemayel's term ran out and no replacement was elected. Aoun
then formed an interim Christian cabinet and Salim Hoss, the acting
prime minister, formed a Moslem cabinet.
   By police count, at least 930 people were killed and 2,744
wounded in six months of fierce artillery duels between Aoun's
forces and the Syrians in and around Beirut before an Arab
League-brokered cease-fire took hold Sept. 22.

<TEXT>
   Jailed black leader Nelson
Mandela, whose release is expected within months, is meeting
regularly with government ministers, a fellow African National
Congress leader said today.
   Govan Mbeki, who spent 23 years in prison with Mandela, visited
his colleague for three hours at Victor Verster Prison outside Cape
Town. Mbeki was released in 1987.
   ``He (Mandela) meets with government ministers more or less on a
continuous basis,'' Mbeki told journalists after the meeting. He
declined to name any of the ministers or reveal the nature of the
discussions.
   Mandela, the country's best known black leader, was taken from
the prison in July to meet with then-president P.W. Botha, and also
has had discussions with Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee.
   President F.W. de Klerk and his top officials have declined to
discuss any dealings they may have had with Mandela.
   Mandela's contact with top government officials is seen as an
effort to lay the groundwork for his release, widely expected in
the next few months.
   Seven of Mandela's ANC colleagues were freed unconditionally
Oct. 15 in what was seen as a test run for his release.
   Mandela is serving a life sentence for a 1964 conviction of
sabotage and plotting to overthrow the government.
   Mbeki, 79, was convicted at the same trial. He was released two
years ago for health reasons, but the government placed him under
tough restrictions that were only lifted earlier this month.
   The ANC, based in Lusaka, Zambia, is the main black group
attempting to undermine the white-led government.
   Mbeki described Mandela as ``alert and fit'' but said the ANC
leader had received no official information as to when he might be
freed.
   ``The question of his release is not in his hands, it is in the
hands of the government,'' Mbeki said.
   Mbeki, who lives in the southern city of Port Elizabeth, is
scheduled to meet with several of the recently released ANC leaders
this weekend at a rally in the black homeland of the Transkei.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pop music star Yana, who first sang in public on a
dare and went on to become one of Britain's most popular singers in
the 1950s and 1960s, has died at the age of 57, her family said.
   Family members said Yana, whose real name was Pamela Guard, died
of cancer of the esophagus on Nov. 21 in London's Middlesex
Hospital.
   Yana's singing career began one night at a party in a London
nightclub. Friends dared her to get up and sing, and the nightclub
owner was so impressed with her voice that he booked her for a
cabaret act.
   She became a top recording star, taking a number of singles to
the No. 1 spot on the British charts. Perhaps her best-known song
was ``Climb Up the Wall.''
   In 1956, British Broadcasting Corp. television featured her in
``The Yana Show'' and she later appeared on the Bob Hope and Ed
Sullivan shows in the United States.
   With her strong, clear voice, figure-hugging gowns and constant
escort of pet poodles, Yana won a huge following in Britain.
   She appeared in lavish stage shows in London's West End and made
her movie debut in 1955, appearing with Jose Ferrer in
``Cockleshell Heroes.''
   Other films she appeared in included ``The Ship that Died of
Shame'' with Richard Attenborough in 1955 and ``Zarak'' with Victor
Mature in 1956.
   She hit the peak of her career in 1958, when she made the first
of many appearances on the top-rated weekly TV variety show
``Sunday Night at the London Palladium.''
   The arrival of The Beatles and other new groups in the 1960s
changed pop music tastes, and Yana's appeal began to fade.
   By the 1980s, she had quit singing and was working as an
assistant in a pharmacy in central London. But then she was
rediscovered and went back to show business.
   Her last stage show appearance was in 1983, and the following
year she was featured in the TV show ``Where Are They Now?'' about
stars who have faded from the public view.

   Israeli warplanes today rocketed two
Palestinian guerrilla bases in southeast Lebanon close to the
Syrian border. Police said one guerrilla was killed and four were
wounded.
   Police said four F-4 Phantom fighter-bombers carried out the
10-minute raid, firing 10 rockets into the bases manned by
Syrian-backed guerrillas of Ahmed Jibril's Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine-General Command.
   Six rockets hit a base in the village of Sultan Yaaqoub, four
miles west of the Syrian frontier in the Bekaa Valley of east
Lebanon.
   Three guerrillas, including the base commander known by the nom
de guerre of Abu Murad, were wounded, police reported.
   The other four rockets demolished a base in Deir Zanoun, four
miles to the south, killing one guerrilla and wounding another,
said a police spokesman who cannot be named under standing
regulations.
   Both bases are north of Israel's self-designated ``security
zone,'' an occupied border strip in south Lebanon. It was set up by
the Israelis in 1985 as a buffer against guerrilla raids.
   The Israeli military command said in a brief communique in
Jerusalem that its planes destroyed one target serving as an
operational base and heaquarters for the guerrilla group. It said
the jets all returned safely.
   The group has been blamed by Western Intelligence agencies for
bombing a New York-bound Pan American jumbo jet over Scotland in
December, killing 270 people. Jibril has denied his group was
involved.
   The radical faction is fiercely opposed to Palestine Liberation
Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat's peace overtures toward Israel.
   Witnesses in the Bekaa said smoke billowed from both guerrilla
bases after the attack, which came a day after Lebanese President
Rene Mouawad was assassinated in Moslem west Beirut. Israeli
officials issued statements warning Lebanese and Palestinian
guerrilla organizations not to take advantage of the turmoil in
Lebanon to launch attacks on Israel.
   Police said Syrian batteries of surface-to-air missiles in the
Bekaa and along the border did not fire on the raiding jets. ``The
Syrians did not interfere in the confrontation at all,'' the
spokesman said.
   Witnesses reached by telephone in the Bekaa said Jibril's
guerrillas opened up with twin-barreled, anti-aircraft guns, but no
hits were observed.
   The Israeli jets released scarlet balloons to deflect
heat-seeking missiles, but none was fired, witnesses said.
   Minutes after the raid, two Israeli jets streaked over Beirut,
causing sonic booms as they broke the sound barrier and drawing
anti-aircraft fire from militia gunners around the city's Moslem
sector.
   Several rounds exploded far below the high-flying jets, leaving
white puffs of smoke beneath the planes' long contrails.
   The Bekaa raid was Israel's 15th against targets in Lebanon this
year. By police count, 17 people were killed and 103 wounded in the
earlier attacks.
   The last was carried out Nov.7 by helicopter gunships against
Iranian-backed guerrillas of the fundamentalist Shiite Moslem
Hezbollah, or Party of God, in south Lebanon.

<TEXT>
   Abortion-rights forces hailed the settlement of a
lawsuit over Illinois abortion regulations, saying it removed the
threat of the U.S. Supreme Court using the case to reverse its 1973
ruling legalizing abortion.
   ``This is a tremendous political victory for the pro-choice
movement,'' said Dawn Johnsen, legal director of the National
Abortion Rights Action League. ``It's a relief having this case off
the Supreme Court's docket.''
   The settlement announced Wednesday would end the battle over
detailed state regulations on abortion clinics.
   Abortion-rights advocates said the rules were unduly restrictive
and would force clinics to either close or make changes that would
make them raise the price of an abortion beyond the reach of many
women.
   The settlement between the state and an abortion clinic's
operator who filed the suit refine the rules to make them
acceptable to both sides, said Dr. Bernard Turnock, director of the
Illinois Department of Public Health.
   The settlement was announced by state Attorney General Neil
Hartigan and the American Civil Liberties Union, which represented
Dr. Richard Ragsdale of Rockford.
   ``The principals in this case,'' Hartigan said, ``have created a
system that protects a woman's health and safety while exercising
her right of choice.''
   Ann-Louise Lohr, staff counsel for the Americans United for Life
Legal Defense Fund, said her anti-abortion group was ``extremely
disappointed'' Hartigan didn't let the case go to the high court.
   She called it a ``backroom deal that will compromise the ability
of all states to protect the health and safety of women.''
   Hartigan, who is running for governor, has said he believes
women are guaranteed the right to choose abortion under the
constitutional right to privacy. But he has also said he favors
restrictions on direct public funding for abortion.
   While Hartigan has portrayed himself as pro-choice in his bid
for the Democratic nomination, his sincerity was questioned
Wednesday by abortion-rights advocates.
   ``He's a political candidate taking the pulse of the
electorate,'' said Patricia Dougherty, executive director of the
Illinois chapter of the National Abortion Rights Action League.
   The U.S. Supreme Court had been scheduled to hear arguments in
the case Dec. 5, but the settlement ends the legal controversy. The
formality of seeking a dismissal remains. Such action, when
requested by both sides in a case, is common.
   Some abortion-rights forces, including Hartigan, had feared that
without a settlement, the Supreme Court might use the case as a
vehicle for overturning its 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision, which
legalized abortion.
   In that landmark ruling, the court forbade states from
interfering with a woman's decision to have an abortion during the
first three months of her pregnancy. The court said states may seek
to protect the women's health during second-trimester abortions and
may seek to protect fetal life in rare third-trimester abortions.
   Under the settlement, the state would allow abortions to be
performed by private physicians in their offices, by doctors at
walk-in surgical clinics and by physicians at full-service
hospitals.
   Walk-in surgical centers that perform abortions as their sole or
majority business would be subject to inspections beginning as
early as next year by the Department of Public Health, Turnock said.
   Surgical centers whose sole business is abortions would be
limited to performing them before the 18th week of pregnancy.
Surgical centers licensed to perform both abortions and other
outpatient procedures could perform them after 18 weeks, he said.
   Unlike the Illinois regulations that were shelved by the case,
the new ones wouldn't require abortion clinics to modify their
buildings in any significant way, said ACLU attorney Colleen K.
Connell.
   Four years ago, Ragsdale won a preliminary injunction against
the Illinois regulations in U.S. District Court in Chicago.
   He contended the state's elaborate building codes for abortion
clinics were medically unnecessary and represented a veiled attempt
by the Public Health Department to restrict women's access to
abortion.
   Barred from enforcing the regulations, Turnock and Hartigan's
office appealed, arguing that the rules were necessary to protect
women's health.
   In 1987, the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with
Ragsdale.
   The requirements include 250-square-foot surgical rooms, some
corridor widths of eight feet, lounges, lockers and separate
toilets for male and female employees and a janitor's closet
adjoining the surgical suite.

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 27-member government representing
Greece's three major parties was sworn in today, temporarily
resolving a political crisis.
   The administration will govern the country until new elections
are held in April.
   Party leaders have been unable to form a coalition government
since the last election Nov. 5, in which none of the parties
received a majority. They said they agreed to a temporary
government to avoid immediate elections and to take steps to save
the collapsing economy.
   The Nov. 5 election was the second in five months in which no
party received enough votes to govern alone.
   The interim government is led by Xenophon Zolotas, the former
central bank governor.
   Following swearing-in ceremonies at the presidential palace,
Zolotas said he planned to submit his government's program to the
Parliament for debate Wednesday.
   He told members of his Cabinet that the government would cut
spending and try to attract foreign investment to reduce the public
deficit.
   Zolotas ruled out a devaluation of the nation's currency, the
drachma, but said it would be permitted to slide against other
currencies.
   The drachma, which had a parity of 30 to the U.S. dollar in
1973, reached 170 this year after several devaluations and
depreciation.
   The 27 Cabinet seats were allocated in proportion to the votes
won by each of the three major parties Nov. 5.
   The conservative New Democracy Party, which won 46.2 percent of
the vote, was given nine ministerial posts. The Panhellenic
Socialist Movement or PASOK, won 40.6 percent of the ballots and
received seven portfolios. Three posts were given to the
Communist-dominated Coalition of the Left and Progress, which
received 10.8 percent of the vote.
   Seven Cabinet positions were retained by members of the
caretaker government that conducted the last general elections.
   None of the three independents or women was given Cabinet slots.
   Radio talk shows received scores of phone calls from listeners
protesting the absence of women in the Cabinet, even though 20 were
elected to Parliament.
   Party leaders Constantine Mitsotakis of New Democracy, former
Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou of PASOK and Harilaos Florakis of
the Coalition of Left and Progress chose the 85-year-old Zolotas to
head the government.
   The temporary end to political uncertainty was greeted by
industrialists seeking official direction with a sigh of relief.
   The Athens Stock Exchange general index on Tuesday closed 5.87
percent higher reflecting renewed confidence by investors after it
had closed lower for five consecutive sessions.

   Ethiopian and Eritrean peace negotiators
settled two more procedural issues today before sitting down to a
traditional American Thanksgiving dinner with former President
Jimmy Carter and his wife.
   Carrie Harmon, a Carter spokeswoman, said the two sides agreed
on a chairman and co-chairman and a secretariate for further, more
substantative talks aimed at ending their 28-year-old civil war.
   ``They are making progress on observers,'' she said, referring
to the last remaining issue to be settled in the preliminary peace
negotiations that began in Atlanta in September.
   Ms. Harmon said she was ``not prepared to disclose the content''
of today's agreements until the question of observers is settled.
The two sides agreed on nine other procedural matters in their
first round of talks.
   ``If the three preliminary issues are resolved, the parties may
move on to consider the agenda for further talks,'' Ms. Harmon said.
   Carter, who is mediating the negotiations, and his wife Rosalynn
treated both seven-member negotiating teams to a turkey dinner at a
Nairobi hotel following 3{ hours of talks today, the fourth day of
the latest round of bargaining.
   The rebels of the Eritrean People's Liberation Front have been
at war with the government in Addis Ababa since 1961 in an effort
to bring independence to Ethiopia's northernmost province.

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An official newspaper today denounced East
Germany's role in the 1968 invasion that crushed a reform movement
in Czechoslovakia, and it said East Germany now should help its
neighbor achieve change.
   Also today, the state-run media quoted the head of state
security, Wolfgang Schwanitz, as blaming the past party and state
leadership for ``deformation'' of the security force.
   The government detailed new laws to curb smuggling of goods
across the border in an effort to prevent further decay of the
troubled economy.
   The newspaper Der Morgan published a surprisingly candid report
on how East Germany helped suppress the popular democratic revolt
in Czechoslovakia, known as the ``Prague Spring,'' 21 years ago.
   ``We must help our southern neighbor to find the courage for
reform, as much as we need it ourselves,'' said the newspaper,
which is run by the Liberal Democratic Party. The party has
recently dislodged itself from a cluster of Communist-controlled
political groups.
   ``We recall our own inglorious role in 1968, when East German
troops with their invasion stomped on the tiny sprouts of renewal
and democracy,'' it said.
   East Germans have made supportive statements about the swelling
pro-democracy movement in Czechoslovakia in recent days, but Der
Morgan's report was the first to acknowledge the part played by
East Germany in suppressing the previous reform drive.
   The official ADN news agency quoted Schwanitz as saying
hard-line leaders in the past hurt the security service.
   ``Discussion with those who thought differently was rejected out
of fear that to do so would mean recognizing them,'' ADN quoted
Schwanitz as saying. Instead, opponents were subjected to
``administrative fighting,'' a euphemism for official harassment,
he said.
   The Communist Party's longtime leader, Erich Honecker, was
ousted Oct. 18 amid an exodus of hundreds of thousands of East
Germans dissatisfied with his orthodox rule. Honecker was replaced
by Egon Krenz, who has opened East Germany's borders and indicated
he is open to some reforms.
   Government spokesman Wolfgang Meyer said new measures to counter
smuggling of consumer goods and black-market sales of currency and
artworks abroad include strict border checks and a requirement that
purchasers in East Germany show identity cards to buy heavily
subsidized goods, such as textiles, food and electronics.
   The move was apparently aimed at many Poles who travel to East
Germany to buy goods and take them back across the border to
Poland, where prices have skyrocketed this year.
   Meyer said the government would not consider devaluation of the
East German mark as part of the recovery effort _ a step seen as
necessary by many Western economists if East Berlin seeks to
bolster its economy.
   New Forum, the leading pro-democracy reform group, issued a
statement today calling on East Germans to renounce currency
speculation, sales of artworks and other black-market activities
that damage the economy.
   ``Take no part in the sellout of our nation,'' the citizens
group declared in the statement carried by ADN.
   On Wednesday, Politburo member Wolfgang Herger indicated during
a public discussion that at least some members of the Communist
elite were willing to do away with one-party rule.
   Herger, who is responsible for security matters, said the
``dogmatic, distorted model of the political system should be
changed in theory as well as practice.''
   Acknowledging their lack of credibility among people who have
taken to the streets by the hundreds of thousands to demand their
ouster, the ruling Communists announced Wednesday their willingness
to open talks with the opposition.
   Poland's Communists opened such talks in February, agreeing in
them to reinstate Solidarity's legal status and hold partially free
elections. Now, Solidarity leads the Warsaw government.

<TEXT>
   More than 200,000 anti-government
demonstrators poured into downtown Prague today, and Alexander
Dubcek, the ousted crusader for reform, arrived in the capital to
address the crowd.
   As pressure mounted for changes in the hard-line Communist
leadership, party chief Milos Jakes hinted that he would not
suppress the demonstrations, which have occurred in Prague for
seven straight days.
   Several plainclothes police officers went to the news center of
Czechoslovakia's state-run television and told top officials not to
broadcast footage of today's demonstration, said a television
employee, speaking on condition of anonymity. The officials agreed,
the employee said by telephone.
   On Wednesday, government television broadcast live, for the
first time, a huge rally in downtown Prague, but the coverage was
abruptly halted after a worker interviewed at the rally accused the
Communist Party of ``lying to us.''
   Today's huge crowd of excited demonstrators gathered in central
Wenceslas Square, the heart of Czechoslovakia's new protest
movement.
   Dubcek, leader of the ``Prague Spring'' reform movement that was
crushed by the 1968 Soviet-led invasion, traveled from his hometown
of Bratislava to give a brief address to the rally, according to
banned playwright Vaclav Havel, the country's most prominent
dissident.
   Dubcek was to be joined by leading representatives of the
Socialist and People's political parties, which have traditionally
been allied with the Communists but which have recently criticized
them.
   The official news agency CTK reported that Jakes met with
representatives of party, trade union and youth organizations as
well as coal miners from northwestern Czechoslovakia. They
indicated support for him but expressed concern about the recent
developments, CTK said.
   Jakes pledged that the party leadership ``will use political
means to halt the negative development in society,'' the agency
reported.
   Unlike other East bloc leaders, Jakes has refused to accept the
reforms that were introduced by Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev
and that have since caused such momentous changes in Poland,
Hungary and East Germany.
   CTK said a meeting of the Communist Party's Central Committee
had been called for Friday, in an apparent move to respond to the
unparalleled unrest.
   The Prague chapter of the Communist youth organization, the
Socialist Union of Youth, today demanded legal reforms to allow
freedom of assembly and an inquiry of top officials.
   The statement also called for an immediate meeting of the
federal Parliament to discuss the current situation in the country
and said the meeting should be broadcast live on state television.
   A group of young party members in a Prague police unit also
demanded ``necessary personnel changes'' in the ruling Politburo to
``restore the effectiveness of the party.''
   Their statement, published in the youth organization's daily
newspaper Mlada Fronta, was the first such demand to come from the
traditionally convervative police ranks.
   More than 200,000 people rallied in downtown Prague on Wednesday
and cheered when a message from Dubcek was read to the crowd.
   Dubcek, now a 67-year-old pensioner, backed demands for the
resignation of President Gustav Husak, who succeeded him as
Communist leader in 1969, and Jakes, responsible for the purge of
Dubcek and half a million other Communists in 1970.
   After years of silence, Dubcek began to speak out publicly this
year as Poland and Hungary, with the blessing of Gorbachev, began
to cast off one-party Communist rule.
   Now, the tide of reform has swept up Czechs and Slovaks. Protest
leaders have called for a general strike Nov. 27 to press their
demands.
   In a victory for those demanding change, a district court today
acquitted prominent Czech dissident Jan Carnogursky of sedition and
subversion charges. But it kept him in prison pending an appeal by
the prosecution, a human rights group said.
   Carnogursky was charged in connection with an article he wrote
for a Bratislava underground monthly and for a statement he and
four other activists signed in August.
   The statement urged Slovaks to mark the 21st anniversary of the
Warsaw Pact invasion by laying flowers in memory of the invasion's
victims.
   Outside the courthouse Wednesday, 15,000 protesters called for
free elections and also shouted ``long live Dubcek!''
   State television, in a departure from longtime practice, briefly
showed Dubcek attending the court session. Dubcek later briefly
addressed the crowd outside.
   Dubcek has been named the winner of the European Parliament's
Sakharov peace prize for 1989.
   Dubcek ``symbolizes for all Europeans our best hopes for
peaceful reform in Eastern Europe,'' Enrique Baron, the
parliament's president, said Wednesday as he announced the 1989
prize winner in Strasbourg, France.
   Parliament officials said they expect Dubcek to come to
Strasbourg in December to collect the prize.
   Havel, meanwhile, was scheduled to receive the Olof Palme peace
award Friday at the Swedish Embassy in Prague. Sweden's foreign
minister, Sten Andersson, is traveling to Prague to deliver the
$15,600 prize, named for the Swedish prime minister assassinated in
February 1986.
   Havel has spent more than three years in jail since 1979 for his
opposition activities.

<TEXT>
   A guerrilla cease-fire proposal
that came on the heels of an 11-day offensive is just
``propagandistic manipulation,'' a government spokesman said today.
   ``The government can't take it seriously,'' said Mauricio
Sandoval, the government's secretary of information.
   There were few reports of gunfire in the capital, and the
morning was largely peaceful for the first time since the
guerrillas offensive began.
   The guerrillas renewed their cease-fire proposal Wednesday night.
   ``They have always tried to change what it means to have a
cease-fire,'' said Sandoval. He noted that the communique hadn't
been addressed to the government but rather to the people of
Salvador and the international community and said that the
government would give no formal reply.
   ``They are doing this because of the big defeat they suffered,
because their offensive failed,'' said Sandoval in a telephone
interview.
   President Alfredo Cristiani said on Wednesday that he believed
the rebels might renew their attacks.
   The guerrilla offer came late Wednesday after the quietest day
the capital has experienced since a rebel offensive began Nov. 11.
Salvadorans began slowly emerging from hiding, stores reopened and
cleanup efforts began.
   ``The shock is over and we can open our market for business,''
said a woman from the battered Mejicanos neighborhood.
   This morning, at a food distribution center in Ciudad Delgado,
more than 400 people lined up for food, although workers inside
said they didn't know if they would get any.
   Gravediggers worked through the morning at the Soyapango
cemetery, burying victims of the fighting near the curb outside the
walls because there was no room left inside. More than 1,000 people
have died in the recent fighting.
   The offensive seemed to be over following an attack on the
wealthy Escalon neighborhood and the occupation of a luxury hotel
trapped a small group of U.S. Army Green Berets for 28 hours.
   President Bush sent a team from the elite Delta Force to rescue
the soldiers if need be, but the guerrillas slipped away after dusk
Tuesday.
   The Green Berets left the compound Wednesday, sprinting across
the pool deck of the hotel.
   Late Wednesday, the rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation
Front renewed its offer to accept a negotiated cease-fire that
would be verified by the United Nations.
   ``To the Security Council of the U.N. we express our disposition
to define an immediate cease-fire,'' the rebels said in a
communique read on Radio Venceremos. The rebels this morning
changed that section to read, ``our willingness to cooperate with
the measures that are adopted in favor of an immediate cease-fire
in our country.''
   The issue of whether to negotiate or ``define'' the details of a
cease-fire before it goes into effect has been a key sticking point
on which peace talks foundered in September and October.
   There was no immediate comment to the modification from the
Salvadoran government, which has proposed an immediate cease-fire
to be followed by negotiations. But before the guerrilla position
was announced Cristiani seemed to play down the possibility of
direct talks in the near future.
   ``The worst is over, but I don't think Escalon was the last
gasp. They are doing some things that look more like regrouping
than withdrawing,'' Cristiani said in an interview Wednesday
afternoon.
   He noted that Joao Baena Soares, the Brazilian secretary-general
of the Organization of American States, had been in town on a peace
mission but left shortly after he was whisked out of the luxury
hotel during the rebel attack.
   ``Maybe he saw enough to draw his conclusions,'' said Cristiani.

its 1989 Sakharov Peace Prize to Alexander Dubcek, who was ousted
as Czechoslovakia's reformist Communist leader in the 1968 Warsaw
Pact invasion.
   Dubcek, 67, ``symbolizes for all Europeans our best hopes for
peaceful reform in Eastern Europe,'' Enrique Baron, the
parliament's president, said Wednesday as he announced the 1989
prize winner.
   Dubcek had been living in obscurity since he was deposed. But
during nationwide, pro-democracy demonstrations this week, huge
crowds in Czechoslovakia have evoked his name and he himself has
backed demands for the resignations of hard-line President Gustav
Husak and party chief Milos Jakes.
   Parliament officials said they expect Dubcek to come to
Strasbourg, where the European Community legislature holds its
monthly plenary sessions, to collect the prize in December.
   ``We believe parliamentary democracy is the foundation of our
common European home,'' Baron said. ``That is why we welcome all
the events taking place in order to establish democratic regimes
throughout Europe.''
   The parliament's Sakharov Prize was awarded for the first time
in 1988 jointly to Nelson Mandela, the imprisoned leader of the
African National Congress, and, posthumously, to Soviet dissident
Anatoli Chernenko.
   The prize is named after Andrei Sakharov, the Soviet dissident
and Nobel prize-winning physicist.

   A 16-year-old who was said to be a
leftist guerrilla was killed by the bomb he was planting at a
municipal building, police said Thursday.
   Another young man was slightly injured in the Wednesday night
explosion in Conchali, a working class district in northern
Santiago.
   The injured man admitted he and the dead youth were members of
the Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front, a leftist urban guerrilla

<HEAD>Guerrilla Leader Offers Rewards For Capture of Disguised Vietnamese</HEAD>

   A Cambodian guerrilla leader is
offering $1,000 to $40,000 in gold to Cambodian soldiers who defect
with Soviet fighter jets or other military hardware or deliver a
Vietnamese soldier wearing a Cambodian army uniform.
   Prince Norodom Ranariddh, who commands one of three guerrilla
groups fighting the Vietnamese-installed government, announced the
reward offers in a broadcast over the resistance radio Wednesday. A
text was seen in Bangkok on Thursday.
   He told government soldiers the government of President Heng
Samrin was corrupt and served only Vietnam, which was fooling the
world with its claims to have withdrawn all its troops in late
September. The guerrillas claim that tens of thousands of
Vietnamese remain in Cambodia, some of them disguised in uniforms
of the Cambodian government army.
   ``All of you can rest assured that this Vietnamese satellite
regime will not last long,'' Ranariddh said.
   ``The resistance forces have now occupied a large part of
territory and are daily welcoming thousands'' of government
defectors, he said.
   He said an officer who brought along a Soviet MiG jet will be
awarded gold worth $40,000. Other types of aircraft such as a
helicopter will fetch $24,000, a tank such as a Soviet-made T-54
will fetch $6,000 and a large-caliber firearm $2,000, he said.
   He promised $1,000 in gold to ``anyone who can deliver live a
Vietnamese soldier in Heng Samrin army uniform.''

   A monument to Vladimir I. Lenin in the
town of Nowa Huta was splashed with paint and set ablaze on the eve
of the visit to Moscow by Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a
newspaper reported Thursday.
   The act was carried out by teen-aged members of the
anti-communist Federation of Fighting Youth movement, the newspaper
Zycie Warszawy quoted a government spokesman as saying.
   ``This act of vandalism, carried out the day before Premier
Mazowiecki's trip to Moscow, carries the traits of a political
provocation and deserves condemnation,'' the spokesman said.
   The youths hurled bottles of flammable liquid on the monument in
the town near Krakow 250 miles south of Warsaw, set fire to it, and
splashed it with paint.
   Officials did not say how much damage was done. An investigation
into the incident has been opened by the Krakow prosecutor's
office, the spokesman said.
   Mazowiecki, the East Block's only non-communist head of
government, left Thursday for Moscow for meetings with President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other top officials.

<TEXT>
   Police and intelligence agents launched a
massive hunt Thursday for a dissident who eluded arrest after
appearing at an opposition campaign rally.
   Intelligence authorities are offering a reward equivalent to
$84,600 for information leading to the arrest of Kuo Pei-hung,
chairman of the Formosan Independence League, a Los Angeles-based
group.
   Kuo, a native of Taiwan, had been barred from returning since
1984 but sneaked back last month. He is wanted on charges of
entering Taiwan illegally.
   Kuo appeared Wednesday at a campaign rally for opposition
candidate Chou Hui-ying and told about 5,000 people he would
continue to campaign for an independent Taiwan.
   Independence means rejection of the ruling Nationalist Party's
claim that Taiwan is a province of China. The Nationalists, who
retreated to the island in 1949 after losing a civil war to
Communist forces on the Chinese mainland, claim to be the
legitimate government of all China and consider calls for an
independent Taiwan to be seditious.
   About 3,000 police at the rally in a suburban Taipei stadium did
not move against Kuo so as not to stir up the crowd. Kuo later
sneaked out when organizers shut off the stage lights and
supporters put on black masks to confuse police.
   The legislative, mayoral and magisterial elections Dec. 2 will
be the first in which the Nationalist Party faces a challenge from
legal opposition parties. Opposition figures formally registered as
independents in previous elections.

   It was not business as usual at
Prague's Barrandov Studios, where Milos Forman filmed ``Amadeus''
and where other Oscar-winning films came to life.
   Telephones rang constantly in a small, crowded office,
transformed into the headquarters of a strike committee supporting
the burgeoning pro-democracy movement.
   ``We will have a one-day strike on Monday,'' said producer
Vaclav Marhoul, who heads the committee. ``We are backing the Civic
Forum'' _ the loosely organized opposition group.
   ``And a delegation from Barrandov has for the first time
Wednesday taken part in the demonstrations on Wenceslas Square,''
he said.
   The square in central Prague has been the scene of daily
protests the past week, with hundreds of thousands of people
gathering to demand a new government and more freedom.
   Work continues at Studio 7 on a French-Czechoslovak
co-production called ``The Last Butterfly.'' It is a film about
German World War II propaganda and how it painted a false picture
of contented life in the Nazi concentration camp at Terezin, a
village north of Prague.
   For many Jews, the camp was the first stop on the way to the
Auschwitz death camp.
   ``Things have become a bit difficult because the Western (actors
and crew) would like to finish the job, of course,'' Marhoul said.
``But they have expressed solidarity with the strike and told us
`OK, we can wait.'''
   British actor Tom Courtenay, who plays a leading role in the
movie, drew applause from Czechoslovak cast members when he told
them he would not press to finish shooting on schedule next week,
when he must go home.
   ``I was very moved,'' he said in an interview between scenes.
``I said I wanted them to know that they have my sympathy and that
I would be available to return later.''
   Courtenay's face was covered with what looked like blood.
   ``No, I was not at last Friday's demo,'' he said with a smile,
referring to the bloody crackdown at the Nov. 17 rally that sparked
the most widespread protests in 20 years.
   ``This is just makeup for the next scene,'' he said. ``But I was
at a demonstration on Tuesday. It was exciting.''
   Courtenay's many previous films included ``The Loneliness of the
Long-Distance Runner'' and ``Dr. Zhivago.''
   Shooting of the film began last August, Some scenes were filmed
at the village of Terezin.
   Director Karel Kachyna, a friend of Forman and himself a winner
of film awards, said he hopes to complete the movie in a few weeks.
   ``But I would not rule out a disruption, as things are changing
that fast,'' Kachyna said.

   Rural Indians took time off from their
fields and revved up family tractors in thousands of villages to
join the celebrations that surround the general elections.
   Bicycles and bullock-carts created traffic jams around polling
centers, veiled women walked alongside slogan-shouting children and
old men were helped into voting booths on the first of three days
of balloting.
   ``It's a festival, everyone is having fun,'' said Dharam Chand,
an election officer in this village 60 miles northwest of New Delhi.
   Next to him on Wednesday, the line for entering one of the
village polling centers was growing steadily. Each cart or tractor
pulling up at the field in front of the center contained as many as
20 people.
   Many were children who formed groups and vied in shouting
slogans of competing political parties. Several men settled under
the shade of a tree to smoke the hookah, the pipe passed from
person to person after each puff, before going in to vote.
   ``It's my right to vote,'' said Karan Singh, a gray-haired
farmer, when asked why the event was important. Singh spoke in
Hindi, but switched to English to repeat: ``Fundamental right.''
   ``My wife and daughter-in-law are going in to vote now,'' he
said, pointing to a group of about 10 women joining the queue with
their heads and faces covered with red and green cotton scarves.
   Wednesday's polling was held in 15 of the country's 25 states
and in five of its seven federally-administered territories. Other
regions go to the polls Friday and Sunday.
   ``It's the elections, but it is also a time to meet friends,
gossip a little,'' said Chand, the election officer. ``Most of
these people have taken a day off from the fields and won't return
home until late afternoon.''
   ``It's also very peaceful. The police don't have much to do,''
he said.
   Elsewhere in the country, there was scattered violence during
the polling. Dozens of people were killed in fights between rival
political groups.
   The farmers at Meham were reluctant to disclose who they would
vote for. ``It seems a close battle between the hand and the
wheel,'' said one, referring to the election symbols of the
governing Congress Party and the National Front, an opposition
coalition.
   The National Front has mounted a strong challenge to Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi's Congress Party and many political analysts
predict it will form the next government. But precise predictions
are difficult because more than two-thirds of the voters live in
villages, often isolated from the election issues considered
crucial.
   ``We don't know what will happen,'' said the Meham farmer. ``But
we'll know by Monday.''

   Space shuttle Discovery's
astronauts deployed a spy satellite today as they whirled around
Earth on a hush-hush military mission that began with a dazzling
nighttime launch.
   There was no official confirmation from NASA or the Pentagon,
but sources close to the project said the 2{-ton, $300 million
payload was released from the shuttle's cargo bay about 10 hours
after Wednesday night's liftoff.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
satellite was designed to monitor Soviet missile tests and listen
in on military and diplomatic communications in the Soviet Union
and other countries.
   A military-imposed news blackout surrounding the flight
continued today, the five crew members' first full day in orbit.
   They were to have a late Thanksgiving dinner of turkey and
cranberry sauce. Because of the night launch, their schedule had
them sleeping until after noon EST.
   The beginning of the classified mission was anything but secret
as Discovery blasted off at 7:23 p.m. from Cape Canaveral, Fla.,
carving a spectacular fiery path across the heavens.
   People at the launch site could see it for more than 600 miles.
   ``It was gorgeous. It was a bright, bright orangy sky,'' said
Dorothy Flores of Winter Park.
   The dark sky over the central Florida coast turned bright as the
shuttle lifted almost straight up and headed over the Atlantic.
   ``We are delighted with the results,'' said Forrest McCartney,
director of the Kennedy Space Center. ``It's something that
Americans can be proud and thankful for on Thanksgiving.''
   The liftoff was only the third after dark, and the time was
dictated by the secret cargo and its mission. The shuttle's ascent
provided a spectacular view over a large part of Florida, but
clouds obscured the visibility for the rest of the Southeast.
   ``It was 100 times brighter than a star,'' said Glenna Milberg,
a television reporter in Miami, 200 miles south of the launch
center.
   ``It looked like a Roman candle,'' over the city's Biscayne Bay,
she said.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration provided
launch commentary until Discovery reached orbit nine minutes after
liftoff. The broadcast system then fell silent until 2{ hours
later, when Mission Control commentator Billie Deason issued a
brief status report.
   ``The crew of Discovery has been given the go for orbit
operations. The orbiter and crew are performing well,'' Ms. Deason
said.
   The satellite is to be put in orbit 22,300 miles over the
equator, with line-of-sight to the Soviet Union, China, the Middle
East, Africa and all of Europe. A similar satellite was released on
a shuttle flight in 1985.
   Unless a problem occurs, the official silence is expected to
continue throughout the flight, except when NASA gives a 24-hour
advance notice of the shuttle's landing.
   The flight, the fifth dedicated entirely to the military, is
expected to last four days. Landing will be at Edwards Air Force
Base, Calif.
   According to military officials, the secrecy is needed to make
it more difficult for Soviet reconnaissance satellites and a spy
ship off Cape Canaveral to track the shuttle.
   But critics argue that Soviet intelligence agents undoubtedly
knew much about the mission before it launched and are keeping
track of Discovery as it orbits Earth.
   To celebrate the holiday today, a fairly traditional
Thanksgiving meal consisting of turkey and gravy, cranberry sauce
and pumpkin bread was packed aboard the shuttle for the crew
members.
   The commander is Air Force Col. Frederick D. Gregory, who was
pilot of the shuttle Challenger on a 1985 flight. Gregory is the
first black astronaut to command a shuttle mission.
   Discovery's pilot is Air Force Col. John E. Blaha, who is making
his second flight this year. He replaced astronaut S. David Griggs,
who was killed while practicing stunt flying in June for an air
show.
   The others crew members are mission specialists F. Story
Musgrave, Navy Capt. Manley ``Sonny'' Carter Jr. and Kathryn C.
Thornton.

   East Germans starting new lives on the
western side of the Berlin Wall feasted on turkey, cranberry sauce
and stuffing Thursday, joining American soldiers for a mess hall
Thanksgiving dinner.
   ``We're sharing our holiday with the East Germans,'' said Maj.
Terrence Meehan, public relations officer for the Berlin Brigade.
``We're extending the hand of friendship.''
   For dessert, besides pumpkin pie and hard candies, there were
horns of plenty spilling over with apples, bananas, grapes and
oranges set in front of a scale model of the Brandenburg Gate
behind a tiny graffiti-covered Berlin Wall.
   ``I never had such a nice dinner. I never saw such a variety of
food,'' said Beate Chilla, who arrived Wednesday from East Berlin
with her husband and their two young sons. ``And everything's
decorated so nicely for the children.''
   Paper napkins and tablecloths featuring orange and brown
drawings of turkeys covered the mess hall tables at Andrews
Barracks, a U.S. base on the southern outskirts of West Berlin.
   Dozens of recent East German immigrants were bused from the
city's Marienfelde reception camp to several U.S. Army dining
halls, including 49 who crowded in with American soldiers and their
families at Andrews.
   ``It's really a symbolic effort limited by the capacity of the
facilities,'' Meehan said. Just providing special meals to American
soldiers and their families already makes Thanksgiving Day a busy
one for the mess halls, he said.
   More than 275,000 East Germans have arrived this year in West
Germany and West Berlin. The flood of refugees fleeing West through
Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary forced the Communist leadership
to lift travel restrictions Nov. 9.
   Since then, the vast majority of the millions of East Germans
who flocked across to visit the West have returned home _ but not
all of them.
   In the past two weeks, more than 40,000 East Germans have
declared their intention to stay in the West, the Bonn government
says.
   Hans-Juergen Eichler, digging into some ham and cranberry sauce,
said he had been seeking permission for two years to emigrate with
his wife and 15-year-old son, but was refused because of his
backing for illegal environmental and human rights groups in East
Germany.
   His wife, Petra, had been allowed twice to visit her grandmother
in West Germany, but Hans-Juergen never crossed the Berlin Wall
until Dec. 10, when he joined at least a million other East Germans
crowding into West Berlin for a look around.
   Under the new rules, it was easy to get permission to emigrate,
and the Eichlers left for good on Wednesday, going to the
Marienfelde camp for help in resettling.
   ``We didn't come for material things. We didn't like the
military way over there,'' said Eichler, wiping thick gravy from
his droopy light-brown mustache.
   In East Berlin, Eichler's job involved placing advertisements on
state railroad trains, but he said he was ready to try anything now.
   ``I will take whatever I can get,'' he said. ``I don't want to
be too selective. The most important thing is to start our lives
over again.''

   A Disney theme park's version of a
graffiti-covered New York subway car is making the city Transit
Authority grumpy as all get-out.
   Invoking six of the dwarfs from ``Snow White,'' TA spokesman
Jared Lebow said: ``This dopey exhibit is nothing to sneeze at. It
besmirches the Snow White image of Disney and we're not bashful
about saying how grumpy it has made us. Doc and other big shots
down there in Orlando must have been awful sleepy when it was
installed. It's an insult to New York City and a special slap in
the face at all the men and women who worked so hard to rid our
subway fleet of graffiti.''
   In May, the TA announced there finally were no trains covered
with graffiti.
   A TA superintendent who visited the Disney-MGM Studio theme park
in Orlando, Fla., brought back photographs of the train, prompting
TA President David L. Gunn to write Disney chief Michael Eisner,
``To truly show your millions of visitors an accurate portrayal of
our system, the graffiti must be removed from the car and station.''
   ``I see no particular reason now to change it,'' Erwin Okun, a
Disney spokesman. ``It's a period piece.''
   ``It accurately reflects a period of time in the New York subway
system. I can bear witness from actual knowledge,'' said Okun, who
lived for 30 years in New York.

<HEAD>Ex-President Marks First Anniversary of Self-Imposed Exile</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Chun Doo-hwan, in
self-imposed exile at a Buddhist temple after resigning in disgrace
a year ago, said Thursday he engaged in some ``trial and error''
while in office but denied harming South Korea.
   Chun spoke at a ceremony marking the first anniversary of his
exile at the Baekdam Temple on the east coast. It was his first
public appearance since he went into exile Nov. 23, 1988.
   ``Because of short wisdom and ability, I committed some trial
and error while in office but the claim that I squandered national
treasure and ruined the country is wrong,'' he said.
   During the one-hour ceremony, Chun, who has converted to
Buddhism, consecrated ``sarira,'' a relic of Buddha, and spoke to
about 5,000 people.
   Chun, who stepped down in February 1988 at the end of his
seven-year term, went into rural exile nine months later after
apologizing for corruption and misdeeds committed under his
administration.
   He surrendered about $24 million in unused political funds
before going into exile. About a dozen members of his family have
been arrested on corruption charges.
   Despite Chun's wish to end his exile, dissident and radical
groups vehemently oppose his return to Seoul, arguing he should be
arrested, tried and punished.
   They charge, among other things, that Chun was involved in the
military crushing of a civil uprising in the southern city of
Kwangju, which resulted in some 200 deaths by official count and
more than 1,500 injuries.
   Critics contend the Kwangju incident was part of efforts by
Chun, then an army general, and his followers to seize power in the
chaotic days that followed the assassination of President Park
Chung-hee.
   The 58-year-old ex-president said that while he made some
mistakes in office, he should receive credit for some actions,
including stepping down at the end of his term to pave the way for
South Korea's first peaceful transfer of power.
   South Korea, formed after Korea's division in 1945, has had a
succession of dictatorships and military coups. Chun himself came
to power in a coup in late 1979.
   ``I was neither expelled nor dropped out of Chongwadae (the
presidential mansion). I was graduated,'' Chun said, referring to
his stepping down at the end of his constitutional term.
   One of Chun's close friends, Roh Tae-woo, succeeded him early
last year after winning a popular presidential vote.
   Chun, wearing a Buddhist monk's robe, looked healthy as he spoke
through a microphone.
   ``On many nights, I abruptly woke up and bolted from the bed,
vowing to retaliate against several people who turned their backs
on me,'' he said. ``But my grudge slowly disappeared as I became
immersed in the profound teaching of Buddha.
   ``After all, I have become a man who would never lose his
temper,'' he added.
   Roh and Chun had been close friends through much of their
careers. They are from the same province and graduated from the
same middle school and the Korea Military Academy. Roh, a former
army general, was closely involved in Chun's seizure of power in
1980.
   But newspapers, quoting Chun's aides, reported he now has a
personal grudge against Roh, believing Roh has been indifferent
toward him.
   A local newspaper quoted Chun as saying, ``I have lost a friend
of 40 years because of politics.''

<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. experts and Czechoslovak exiles give Alexander
Dubcek, the ousted 1968 ``Prague Spring'' hero whose name is being
chanted by his countrymen, an outside chance of making a political
comeback.
   Some said the one time Czechoslovak Communist Party chief, who
turns 68 Monday, would be ideal for a peaceful transitional role.
   U.S. specialists on East Europe, Czechoslovak exiles and
Czech-and Slovak-Americans were asked to weigh the prospects for
Dubcek, ousted and thrown into official disgrace after the 1968
Soviet invasion of his homeland.
   There is an acute shortage of leadership acceptable to both the
throngs demonstrating for change and the hard line leaders still in
power after deposing Dubcek a generation ago, they said.
   ``I think Dubcek is the ideal man, acceptable to (Mikhail)
Gorbachev, who could maintain some semblance of stability, while
they take time to make serious changes,'' said John Hvasta,
executive director of the Slovak American National Council.
   ``All our Slovak-American organizations are banking on Dubeck to
emerge and maintain stability,'' Hvasta said. ``He is the man at
least for this time. No other potential leader that anyone is
familiar with has emerged'' who could maneuver a course to stop
short of ``an untested situation such as an uprising,'' he added.
   Like other U.S. Czechoslovak-watchers, Hvasta frequently
contacts acquaintances in Czechoslovakia by direct-dial telephone.
He quoted one, whom he would not identify, as saying Dubcek
journeyed this week to Prague from his retirement home in
Bratislava, capital of Slovakia. A cheering crowd of 200,000 in the
capital was told Friday Dubcek would soon appear before them.
   Restoration of Dubcek would not be as simple as it might appear,
experts said, even though during the Prague Spring his countrymen
idolized him for pioneering reforms now favored by the Kremlin
under Gorbachev.
   Those in power in Prague are the very people installed to
scuttle the Prague Spring, striving constantly since then to
discredit Dubcek and his reforms, turning Czechoslovakia into one
of Europe's most authoritarian countries.
   Milos Jakes, now the Communist Party chief, personally led the
purge of more than 400,000 Dubcekites forced to support themselves
at hard labor or menial work at the end of the 1960s. Most are
still barred from high profile jobs and many emigrated.
   The experts said 20 years of such policy denied the country a
chance to develop alternative leadership able to take over today
and pilot Czechoslovakia to a soft landing among the democracies.
   Dubcek ``could play a every important role in transition,'' said
a U.S. government expert speaking on condition of anonymity. ``It
would depend whether socialism is what both sides want,'' he said,
noting that Dubcek always reaffirmed his dedication to Marxism even
while blacklisted as the enemy of the communists who succeeded him.
   The post-Dubcek purge created a true ``leadership gap,'' in
Czechoslovakia, aggravated by the young generation staying out of
public life, the source added.
   Ohio State University historian and journalism professor Jiri
Hochman voiced ``a remote possibility that under the right
circumstances Dubcek might be called to new leadership if the
Russians recommend it.
   ``There is hardly any other possibility to institute order, no
reserve team, no known personality,'' Hochman said, agreeing with
other experts. The leadership is ``all so terribly discredited.
Their recruitment for the last 15 years has been complete
mediocrity,'' said Hochman, one of Czechoslovakia's best known
journalists and editors until he was purged and imprisoned after
the Soviet invasion.
   Johns Hopkins University professor George Liska said the
Czechoslovak communists ``could use Dubcek as a front man for
continuity,'' but expressed doubt that he would be re-elevated to
leadership.
   Dubcek is as responsible as anyone for the Soviet invasion
``because he failed to control events'' in 1968 when ``much could
have been saved'' of the Prague Spring, said Liska, who left
Czechoslovakia at the time of the 1948 communist takeover.
   William H. Luers, U.S. ambassador to Czechoslovakia in 1983-86,
said ``the key actor in changing the (Leonid) Brezhnev-installed
leadership in Prague ... is likely to be Gorbachev, who despite his
non-intervention policy is becoming impatient.
   ``In the past week, a new phase began, which will end the
Brezhnev era in Czechoslovakia as it is ending in Hungary, Poland,
East Germany, Bulgaria and the Soviet Union,'' Luers, now president
of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, wrote in a
Washington Post article.

<HEAD>Fifth Body Found in Murder Investigation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHILLICOTHE, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A corpse weighted down with a concrete
block was pulled from a well on a farm, bringing to five the number
of bodies discovered in a murder investigation focusing on an
elderly couple.
   The body taken from the 28-foot well near Ludlow on Wednesday
was that of a man 25 to 30 years old, but the identity and cause of
death were not immediately known, the Livingston County coroner's
office said.
   The discovery came in the seventh week of an investigation into
the disappearance of drifters hired to work for Ray and Faye
Copeland, a farm couple from nearby Mooresville. Copeland is 75,
his wife 68.
   The bodies of four men _ all of them shot in the head _ were
found in shallow graves last month in two barns near the Copeland
farm.
   Three have been identified, and the Copelands were charged with
murder in those deaths. They are in jail on $500,000 bail each.
   The Copelands are suspected of killing their employees after
using them to buy cattle fraudulently. Prosecutors said they
believe the couple hired transients, set them up with small bank
accounts, then had the employees write checks for cattle. The
checks bounced, by which time the employees had disappeared.
   Investigators used a backhoe to dig 30 feet to the bottom of the
well after deciding it was too unstable to lower anyone into it,
Sheriff Leland O'Dell said. The well is about 150 yards from a barn
where the fourth body was found.

<HEAD>China Criticizes Congressional Bill on Chinese Students</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China on Thursday described as ``unacceptable'' a
U.S. congressional bill making it easier for Chinese students
fearing persecution at home to remain in the United States.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Jin Guihua said the government would
``make some due response'' to the U.S. legislation, but he refused
to elaborate.
   ``It is international practice to request personnel studying
abroad to return to the home country and give their service,'' Jin
said. ``China and the United States have reached a clear
understanding of this in their educational exchanges.''
   ``The bill of the U.S. Congress runs counter to the agreements
between the two governments. ... The basis on which the U.S.
Congress proposed such a bill is even more unacceptable,'' he said.
   Nearly half the estimated 80,000 Chinese studying abroad are in
the United States, and most hold exchange visitor visas, or ``J''
visas.
   The bill, passed by both houses of Congress, would allow them to
apply for a change in visa status within four years.
   Currently, holders of J visas must return home for at least two
years before applying to the United States for a different visa.
   The bill, which President Bush is expected to sign into law,
also requires the Justice Department to give special consideration
to Chinese citizens who seek asylum in the United States because of
China's population control policy of allowing only one child per
couple.
   China has insisted there will be no reprisals against the many
Chinese students abroad who participated in pro-democracy
demonstrations before and after the June 3-4 military crackdown on
demonstrators in Beijing.
   It also has said top priority will be given to finding
appropriate jobs and ensuring good living conditions for returning
students.
   A serious brain drain of students reluctant to return to China
has accelerated since the June political turmoil. The United States
and most other Western countries already have extended the visas of
students concerned about political persecution upon their return.

<HEAD>Thatcher to Meet With Bush in 24-Hour Visit</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 1st graf to CORRECT day of meeting to Friday, sted Thursday.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In talks with President Bush on Friday, Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher likely will be seeking support for her
view that however dramatically Europe is changing, the NATO
alliance should not lower its guard.
   Mrs. Thatcher visits the United States once a year on the
average, and this 24-hour trip was arranged weeks before the
political picture in Europe was transformed by the opening of the
Berlin Wall.
   But the visit to Camp David now takes on added significance,
given the West's need to formulate a united response to the
changes. It comes eight days before Bush's summit with Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. A summit of the 12-nation European
Economic Community states follows on Dec. 8-9.
   Mrs. Thatcher told reporters as she left for the airport: ``I'm
delighted with his (Bush's) speech last night.''
   She was referring to Bush's televised address to the nation
Wednesday night in which he praised Gorbachev's reforms, urged him
to ``bring down the last barriers'' and end the Cold War, and
promised to support the reforms in Eastern Europe without taking
adversarial advantage of them.
   After several meetings with Gorbachev, Mrs. Thatcher is effusive
in her praise, lauding him as a reformer of courage and vision. But
she is also cautious about his chances of completing the revolution
he has unleashed.
   Therefore, she continues to advocate a strong NATO and opposes
any changes in the present lineup of NATO and Warsaw Pact forces,
lest they become ammunition for Gorbachev's hard-line foes.
   She reiterated this stance in her legislative program for 1990,
which pledged Britain to uphold its NATO obligations and ``sustain
the United Kingdom's contribution to Western defense by maintaining
adequate and effective nuclear and conventional forces.''
   Giving her view of European events, she said: ``Times of great
change are times of great uncertainty, even danger.
   ``We have to be prepared for any threat, however unexpected. As
events demonstrate ever more conclusively, we are winning the
battle of ideas. We must make sure that we don't subsequently lose
the peace.''
   She and Bush will likely discuss the NATO states' decision in
May to defer until 1992 a firm decision on the deployment of new
short-range nuclear missiles in West Germany.
   Even before the Wall opened, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
was balking at having to take new missiles. Now the task is far
more complex, but Mrs. Thatcher remains committed to it.
   Domestically, the 64-year-old prime minister is looking more
vulnerable than when she last visited Washington a year ago to say
goodbye to her ideological soulmate, Ronald Reagan, and welcome
Bush into the fold of Western democratic leaders.
   Resurgent inflation and criticism of her combative style of
leadership have pushed her as far as 11 points behind the
opposition Labor Party in opinion polls.
   Before the year is out she is likely to face an unprecedented
formal challenge to her leadership. The annual election of
Conservative Party leader has been a formality throughout her 10
years in office. But this time, rank-and-file lawmaker Sir Anthony
Meyer says he will probably seek her job.
   He has no chance of success, but says he hopes his move will
galvanize other disenchanted Tories into sending her a message of
discontent.

   President Bush's Thanksgiving-eve speech
appears to have quietened criticism that he has been too timid in
the face of changes in Eastern Europe while also reassuring those
who feared a free-wheeling superpower summit next week.
   ``Though there will be no surprises sprung on our allies, we
will miss no opportunity to expand freedom and enhance the peace,''
Bush said of his upcoming first meeting as president with Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``And to those who question our prudent pace, they must
understand that a time of historic change is no time for
recklessness,'' he said.
   While praising Gorbachev and offering him the hand of
partnership, Bush made clear his agenda for the Dec. 2-3 meeting
with Gorbachev off the Mediterranean island of Malta: It is the
Soviets, not Westerners who must keep moving.
   He said the Kremlin ``has made progress,'' but still had room to
improve, urging Gorbachev to curtail military aid to Cuba and
Nicaragua.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., previously had
criticized Bush as being ``perhaps too detached and too calm, too
relaxed about things that are truly exciting.''
   Foley recalled that when Solidarity leader Lech Walesa appeared
last week before a joint meeting of Congress, ``there was a sense
of electricity in the chamber, of enthusiasm, and celebration and
excitement.''
   After Bush's speech Wednesday night, Foley applauded the
president for echoing those feelings.
   ``Democrats now expect the president to approach these historic
issues with determination and prudence,'' Foley said on Cable News
Network.
   In his speech, Bush said he will seek Gorbachev's ``assurance
that this process of reform in Eastern Europe will continue.''
   He did not mention requests from the Soviets and Poland for
American economic advice and assistance but did say he had sought a
meeting with Gorbachev to forge ``a new partnership.''
   ``As we begin the next decade, I am reaching out to President
Gorbachev, asking him to work with me to bring down the last
barriers to a new world, with a new Europe, rising on the
foundations of democracy,'' he said.
   While some critics had focused on what they viewed as Bush's
timidity, others had expressed worries that his first meeting as
president with Gorbachev might resemble the 1986 summit at
Reykjavik, Iceland.
   Unexpectedly, President Reagan and Gorbachev used that occasion
to discuss eliminating their entire nuclear arsenals. In the end,
they parted angrily over the U.S. Star Wars program.
   Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va., said Bush ``kept expectations about
where they ought to be ....''
   ``I was concerned at Reykjavik because it seemed to me that ...
Gorbachev and President Reagan had somehow become involved in a
higher stakes poker game than I thought they ought to be at that
particular point,'' said Robb.
   In his address, Bush said the events in Eastern Europe still
have not removed ``the invisible walls of suspicion ..., doubt,
misunderstanding and miscalculation'' between East and West.
   ``This is a first meeting _ a time for exploration. It is not a
time for detailed arms control negotiations best left for next
year's summit,'' he said, referring to a meeting scheduled in the
United States next spring or summer.
   Reaffirming the need of the United States to move in step with
its allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Bush said he
would travel straight from Malta to NATO headquarters in Belgium.
   ``I will assure them that no matter how dramatic the change in
Eastern Europe, or in the Soviet Union itself, the United States
will continue to stand with our allies and our friends,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Polish Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the East
bloc's only non-Communist head of government, arrived in Moscow
Thursday night hoping to place relations with the Soviet Union on
an equal footing.
   More than 40 years of Communist rule in Poland ended in August
when the Polish parliament elected Mazowiecki, a former Solidarity
trade union editor and close adviser to Lech Walesa, to lead the
new government.
   The prime minister has said Poland will respect its Warsaw Pact
obligations, but that relations with the Soviet Union, long
dominated by Moscow, must be based on reciprocity.
   Mazowiecki, flying on a special Polish miliary aircraft, landed
at Moscow's Vnukovo Airport and was welcomed by a small group of
Soviet officials led by Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov
   The Polish leader was given a large bouquet of pink roses by two
Polish children who live in Moscow. A motorcade then whisked him
into town, where he is scheduled to begin meetings Friday with
Kremlin officials, including President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Although bound by economic and military treaties to Moscow, the
new Polish government is emotionally distant.
   Mazowiecki's first foreign trip took him to Rome to meet with
Polish-born Pope John Paul II, and not to Moscow as tradition
required of his Communist predecessors.
   Nevertheless, the new Polish government recognizes the
importance of economic relations with its powerful neighbor.
   Poland would like to renegotiate the terms of trade with the
Soviet Union, which accounts for one-third of Poland's foreign
trade. A high-level delegation of economic officials is
accompanying Mazowiecki.
   The Soviet Union supplies almost all of Poland's oil, natural
gas and iron ore as well as many of its cars, planes, washing
machines and televisions.
   Poland is seeking Soviet support as it makes the transition to a
market-oriented economy and tries to make its currency, the zloty,
convertible on world money markets.
   During his five-day visit, Mazowiecki also intends to seek
improvement in the situation of an estimated 2 million ethnic Poles
who live in the Soviet Union.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said the
Kremlin expects the Polish leader's visit to improve relations.
``We expect the positive development of Soviet-Polish relations to
continue after Tadeusz Mazowiecki's visit,'' Gerasimov told a
government news briefing.
   In Warsaw, Polish government spokeswoman Malgorzata
Niezabitowska said the situation in East Germany and the issue of
German reunification would be among the political issues discussed
during Mazowiecki's visit.
   Both Poland and the Soviet Union suffered from German aggression
in the past, and appear wary of the potential re-emergence of a
unified, powerful German nation in the heart of Europe.
   After two full days of talks and meetings in Moscow with
Gorbachev, Ryzhkov and other Soviet officials, Mazowiecki is to
focus on religion and the painful legacy of World War II.
   A Roman Catholic, the Polish leader is to travel Sunday to the
city of Zagorsk, site of a well-known Russian Orthodox monastery.
   Later that day, he is scheduled to travel west to the Katyn
forest where more than 4,300 Polish officers were murdered in World
War II. The Soviets originally blamed the Nazis, but Polish members
of a joint Soviet-Polish historical commission created to study the
massacre said this year there was no reasonable doubt the Soviets
were responsible.
   During a visit to Poland on Oct. 24-25 to prepare Mazowiecki's
trip, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said the
Kremlin was committed to establishing the truth about who killed
the Polish officers.
   Gerasimov also said that ``blank spots'' in the history of
Soviet-Polish relations must be filled in.
   ``Both Poland and ourselves should now look forward and think
how to improve relations,'' he said. ``Their development is
sometimes hindered by efforts to cling to the past. The sooner
these issues are resolved, the better.''

   Rescue workers recovered 20 bodies
following an accident between two boats plying the Zaire River
north of Kinshasa, police said Thursday.
   The accident near Kutu, 185 miles north of the capital, occurred
when a wooden passenger barge hit a small boat hauling freight for
an agricultural company, police in Kutu said.
   The barge, powered by an outboard motor, was capable of ferrying
up to 80 passengers, said a police spokesman.
   It was not known how many people were on the barge at the time
of the accident, and recovery operations continued through late
Thursday.
   Among the dead were members of a regional football club, the FC
Monbende, police said.

   A weeklong ``summit festival'' of music,
folk dancing and village feasts will kick off Sunday to mark the
superpower shipboard summit off Malta on Dec. 2-3, the government
said Thursday.
   Most of the activities will be held in museums, squares, streets
and gardens in the island's capital of Valletta. But on the two
days of the summit the festival switches over to Marsaxlokk, a
southern fishing village.
   The ships on which Presidents Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev will
hold their talks are expected to dock either in Marsaxlokk Bay or
nearby.
   Besides marches and concerts, there will also be on both days a
``Festa Maltija'' _ a Maltese food and drink festival that usually
draws large crowds.
   A fireworks display over Grand Harbour, Malta's main port, will
conclude the festival Dec. 3.

   Thieves have stolen a briefcase
containing stamps worth $313,000 from a U.S. dealer, police said
Thursday.
   Warren Chi-Hoa, 41, of Los Angeles, had placed the briefcase on
a chair while eating at the cafeteria in Zurich's main railway
station Tuesday night. He discovered the case was missing as he was
about to leave after the meal, police said.
   The case contained two albums of ancient Chinese stamps, and 40
envelopes bearing other rare specimens. About $1,500 in cash and an
air ticket from Zurich to Los Angeles via New York also were stolen.
   The theft occurred while a stamp auction was taking place in the
city. Police spokesman Jan Karbe declined to say whether Chi-Hoa
had purchased the stamps at the auction.

   A court has decided no trial will be held
in Belgium on the 1987 Zeebrugge ferry disaster that killed 193
people because the ship and all its victims were British, officials
said Thursday.
   Judge Arthur D'Hoest had been working on the case for two years
and will turn over thousands of pages of his work to British
officials, said spokesman Filip Van Belle.
   Court proceedings have opened in Britain against the owners of
the capsized Herald of Free Enterprise, and seven employees. A
trial in Britain could start early next year.
   The Bruges court based its decision not to pursue a trial in
Belgium on a 1961 international treaty stipulating that trials in
such disasters can be held in the country of the ship's flag.
   The court found there was no need for a trial since no Belgian
interests were involved. Van Belle also said two trials would be
too confusing and a waste of time.
   The Herald of Free Enterprise capsized in less than a minute on
March 6, 1987, just outside Zeebrugge harbor.

   It was late at night and the Sandinista search
for those elusive Nicaraguan Contras was on. After two hours of
frustration, the Sandinistas decided to call it a night.
   The scene was not a remote Nicaraguan battlefield but a
non-descript office building a few blocks from the White House
where Sandinista and Contra negotiators had spent seven days trying
to work out a cease-fire.
   On the night in question, the Contras took a recess from the
talks and caucused among themselves, leaving the Sandinista
delegation in the dark as to their whereabouts. Two hours passed.
There was no sign of the Contras.
   ``We don't know where they are,'' the chief Sandinistas
negotiator, Victor Hugo Tinoco, told reporters after deciding he
had waited long enough. ``This building is rather large.'' He left.
   The episode seemed to crystallize the inability of the two sides
to achieve harmony even on relatively simple issues. This past
Tuesday, the talks were suspended indefinitely, both sides agreeing
their efforts were going nowhere.
   The pattern resembles what has been happening in other regional
conflicts: Angola, Afghanistan and Cambodia.
   In each instance, the U.S.-Soviet dimension of the conflict has
diminished but long years of accumulated mistrust among local
rivals are impeding negotiated settlements. Accordingly, the
warfare continues, albeit at differing levels of intensity.
   In Nicaragua, the United States suspended military aid to the
Contra rebels almost two years ago. The fighting continues with
each side accusing the other of being the obstacle to peace.
   Indeed, the collapse of the Nicaraguan cease-fire talks combined
with the escalated fighting in El Salvador in recent weeks has
raised doubts whether the Central America peace process, which has
boasted a number of highly touted ``peace'' breakthroughs, is still
viable.
   A peace settlement in Nicaragua will hinge largely on whether
the national elections set for February produce a result that
Nicaraguans of all political colors can live with _ or at least
accept as legitimate.
   In El Salvador, there is nothing to indicate that the government
and the rebels have the political will to negotiate their
differences.
   Angola's experience is somewhat similar to Central America. Just
weeks ago, there were hopes for a cease-fire followed by talks on
national reconciliation between the leftist government and the
U.S.-backed rebels.
   Instead, fighting has escalated recently. U.S. officials believe
the more militant factions in the Angolan government leadership
have the upper hand over those favoring a political settlement.
   Meanwhile, the East-West dimension of the 14-year-old conflict
in Angola has diminished with the continuing withdrawal of what had
been a 50,000-strong Cuban troop presence. All the Cubans are due
to be home by early 1991 but Moscow and Washington are continuing
to arm their respective allies.
   In Afghanistan, the Soviets completed their withdrawal more than
nine months ago. But there is nothing resembling a peace process
between the warring faction and Soviet and American weapons
continue to pour in.
   In Cambodia, troops from the pro-Soviet government in Vietnam
have left after a 10-year stay but, once again, a political
settlement seems beyond reach at the moment.
   The incumbent government in Phnom Penh has refused to consider
any role in a transition arrangement for the Khmer Rouge because of
the mass killings they carried out when they ruled Cambodia during
the latter half of the 1970s.
   The Khmer Rouge remain a force to be reckoned because of the
large and powerful guerrilla army they have developed since their
ouster from power.
   While the superpower component of all the conflicts has been
reduced, Washington and Moscow are still involved enough in each to
give President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev plenty to
talk about when they meet next week.

   Israel won't be drawn into the Lebanese
conflict again and Lebanon's Christian army commander, Gen. Michel
Aoun, ``will pay the price'' for his mistakes, a government
official said Thursday.
   Syria has accused Aoun of involvement in the assassination
Wednesday of new President Rene Mouawad, a Christian rival of the
general. Aoun denies it.
   ``We don't support Gen. Aoun,'' said Yossi Olmert, director of
the Israeli Government Press Office. ``We are not in the pocket of
any Lebanese warlord; no Lebanese warlord is in our pocket.''
   Israel was allied with the Christians when it invaded Lebanon in
1982 to drive out the PLO, but has taken an increasingly neutral
position since withdrawing in 1985 from all but a border ``security
zone'' in south Lebanon.
   Iraq has backed Aoun because of its enmity for Syria, and Olmert
claimed the Palestine Liberation Organization also supports the
Christian general's efforts to drive Syrian forces out of Lebanon.
   ``The Arab enemies of Syria do not happen to be our friends,''
Olmert said in an interview, and added about Aoun: ``He will do
what he likes to do, and he will pay the price. It is his problem.''
   Mouawad was killed 17 days after Parliament elected him with a
mandate to seek an end to the 14-year-old Lebanese civil war, in
which more than 150,000 people have been killed.
   Aoun called him a ``Syrian lackey.''
   Israeli officials warned Lebanese factions and Syria not to take
advantage of instability following the assassination to threaten
Israel's security.
   ``We say to everybody concerned, Lebanese and others, they
should not infringe on our vital security interest in south
Lebanon,'' said Olmert, a former professor of Middle East studies
at Tel Aviv University.

<HEAD>Warsaw Pact Growing More Like NATO: They're Quarreling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reeling from the pace of political and
economic changes, the Soviet military alliance in Eastern Europe is
looking more like NATO: It's members are quarreling among
themselves, administration sources say.
   The disagreements are largely over procedural matters and have
not disrupted negotiations nor undermined the Soviet Bloc's
position on cutting troops in Europe, the sources said, likening
them to disputes within NATO.
   Delegates from Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria, where reforms have
been slow to take hold, do not fully trust negotiators from Poland,
Hungary and East Germany, where changes have been quicker, the
sources said.
   As a result, the Czechs and Bulgarians have balked at exchanging
data and disagreed with their Warsaw Pact allies on where to hold
strategy sessions, said the sources, speaking on the condition they
not be identified further.
   The rancor illustrates how the rapid change in Eastern Europe
and talk of a reunification of East and West Germany are forcing
the U.S. and Soviet military alliances to review their roles.
   ``The issue of Germany, the nature of NATO, the nature of
Europe, are all up for discussion and need to be reconsidered,''
former White House national security adviser Henry Kissinger said
last Sunday on ABC-TV.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has proposed that the
Eastern and Western military alliances be scrapped and that the
superpowers withdraw their forces from Europe.
   President Bush has rejected that idea, repeating in his
Thanksgiving address that ``in a new Europe, the American role may
change in form but not in fundamentals.''
   Bush's first stop after his summit next week with Gorbachev will
be to consult with NATO allies in Belgium. Even if U.S. and Soviet
forces are significantly reduced, he said, ``we will remain in
Europe as long as our friends want and need us.''
   The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which includes the
United States and 15 other nations, will play a role in Europe ``no
matter what happens on the eastern side of the division,'' said
Francis Fukiyama, deputy director of policy planning at the State
Department.
   But, Fukiyama added, ``Everyone is looking with uncertainty at
the future of the Warsaw Pact.''
   So far, the reform governments in Poland and Hungary have
pledged to remain in the pact. But changes in those two nations
will oblige the Soviets to reform the alliance, which _ unlike NATO
_ is a purely military rather than a political and military
coalition, said a senior Solidarity official who visited Washington
last week with Lech Walesa.
   ``This is an idea we are passing along to the Soviets, just to
sleep on,'' said Janusz Onyszkiewicz, the Solidarity national
spokesman and deputy chairman of the foreign affairs committee in
the lower house of the Polish parliament.
   The Soviets have already woken up to the idea, said Yuri
Davydov, head of European studies at the USA-Canada Institute, a
Moscow think tank.
   ``The Warsaw Treaty Organization needs a structure more similar
to that of NATO,'' Davydov said.
   In the past, the Communist Party leaders of Warsaw Pact members
met regularly to review policy, but that process has lost meaning
because Poland has a Solidarity-led government and Hungary has
scrapped its Communist Party.
   Fukiyama, Davydov and Onyszkiewicz said in separate interviews
it is likely that the Warsaw Pact will establish something akin to
the secretariat NATO has in Belgium. Leaders of its member
countries and their defense and foreign ministers would then hold
regular consultations, like those of NATO.
   ``They have no choice but to change the structure of the Warsaw
Treaty Organization,'' said the State Department's Fukiyama. ``It
is going to have to be an alliance of free countries, along the
lines of NATO. I think we have to encourage that.''
   Meanwhile, the Bush administration's byword is caution.
   `Our attitude must be that we not be seen pushing for the
breakup of the Warsaw Pact. That is a matter for those countries to
decide,'' Fukiyama said.
   Dissolving either alliance would be a mistake; both will be
needed to stabilize Europe during rapid change, said Zbigniew
Brzezinski, who was President Carter's national security adviser.
   ``A more stable way to establish a framework for a more unified
Europe would be not to abolish the alliances, but to use them as
pillars for a new order of shared geopolitical interests,''
Brzezinski said in a speech during Walesa's visit.
   Brzezinski said he envisions a Europe in which some nations
could belong to a reformed Warsaw Pact and at the same time be
affiliated with the European Common Market.
   The key reason for preserving the alliances is to assure that a
united Germany would not threaten Europe, said Francois Heisbourg,
head of the London-based International Institute for Strategic
Studies.
   ``There could be a threat ... if Germany reunited outside of the
alliance system,'' Heisbourg said on ABC.
   Dismembering the Warsaw Pact would not guarantee the withdrawal
of the half million Soviet troops in East Germany, Poland and
Czechoslovakia, because Moscow has bilateral security arrangements
with those countries.
   But those troops, concentrated in East Germany, worry some
Soviets.
   ``We are ready to liquidate our military presence in Europe as a
whole,'' said Davydov, stressing that the Red Army has ``no
security role to play'' in Central Europe now that East-West
tensions are reduced.
   Moreover, Davydov said, ``these troops (in East Germany) cannot
play any political role .... The presence of these troops irritates
people.''

   Parliament probably will convene Friday
to choose a successor to President Rene Mouawad, who was slain
while forming a government he hoped could end Lebanon's civil war,
an aide to the speaker reported.
   Flags flew at half staff, church bells tolled and a general
strike brought life to a standstill in Syrian-controlled regions in
mourning for Mouawad, who was assassinated Wednesday.
   Hussein Husseini, the Shiite Moslem speaker of Parliament,
tentatively set the session for Friday at the Kleiat airbase in
Syrian-controlled north Lebanon, his aide said.
   Mouawad was elected Nov. 5 in a session held at Kleiat because
Gen. Michel Aoun, the Christian military commander, threatened to
shell the Parliament building in Beirut. A new Lebanese peace plan,
which Aoun opposes, was approved the same day.
   In Damascus, the Syrian defense minister accused Aoun of
ordering Mouawad killed in order to undermine the peace agreement.
   ``We shall cut off ... the hand which has assassinate Lebanese
legitimacy ... and very soon,'' Lt. Gen. Mustafa Tlass said
Thursday. He did not elaborate.
   Iranian state radio said a Foreign Ministry official urged
Lebanese Moslems to ``confront this new conspiracy'' aimed at
bolstering Aoun.
   The general denied involvement and, in a statement Thursday,
said Mouawad was ``a national martyr because he was murdered in the
shadow of Syrian occupation.''
   Four Israeli Phantom jets attacked guerrilla bases at Sultan
Yaaqoub and nearby Deir Zanoun, close to Syria in east Lebanon.
Police reported one guerrilla killed and four wounded at bases of
the Syrian-backed Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command.
   Israel has made 14 previous raids into Lebanon this year, in
which 17 people were reported killed and 103 wounded.
   Aoun's Christian forces and Druse militiamen allied with Syria
skirmished after sundown in hills southeast of Beirut. No
casualties were reported.
   The fighting and the Tlass declaration added to fears that a
2-month-old truce would collapse because of the death of Mouawad, a
64-year-old Maronite Catholic who was trying to end a sectarian
civil war that has taken more than 150,000 lives in 14 years.
   Mouawad and 23 other people were killed by a remote-controlled
bomb that exploded in a street of Moslem west Beirut as his
motorcade passed. Police said thousands of people had fled Beirut
since the assassination to safer parts of the country.
   Aoun opposes the peace accord, reached by Lebanese legislators
Oct. 24 in Taif, Saudia Arabia, because it does not guarantee
speedy withdrawal of the 40,000 Syrian soldiers stationed in
Lebanon. The general also said Mouawad's election was illegal and
called him a ``Syrian lackey.''
   Husseini's aide said the air base had been told planes carrying
some of the Lebanese legislators currently abroad could arrive ``at
any moment.''
   Forty-three Moslem and Christian lawmakers drove from west
Beirut to Mouawad's hometown of Zgorta in north Lebanon on Thursday
to offer condolences to his family and be on hand for the session.
   ``The speaker is trying to convene Parliament to elect a new
president before Mouawad's funeral'' Saturday in Zgorta and ``will
announce the final date for the session once he is sure that a
quorum is guaranteed,'' the aide said.
   In order to elect a head of state, 48 deputies must be present:
two-thirds of the 72 surviving since the last election in 1972.
   Among the leading candidates, the aide said, are deputies Butros
Harb, Fuad Naffaa and Pierre Helou.
   All are Maronites, as Lebanese presidents have been since
independence from France in 1943. Under terms of an unwritten
covenant, the president is Christian, the prime minister Sunni
Moslem and the Parliament speaker Shiite Moslem.
   Harb leads a powerful Maronite clan, Naffaa is a former foreign
minister and Helou is a businessman. They have good relations with
Lebanese Moslems and with Syria, the country's main power broker.
   Political sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a
tougher candidate such as former President Suleiman Franjieh would
be more likely if there were plans to move against Aoun.
   Franjieh, a powerful pro-Syrian Maronite chieftain from Zgorta,
``is the only person capable of shouldering the responsibility of
confronting Aoun militarily,'' one said. ``He's not the type of man
who would leave the presidential palace under Aoun's control.''
   Aoun occupies a bunker under the presidential palace at Baabda,
east of Beirut, and refused to turn the residence over to Mouawad.
The palace was battered by shellfire during an artillery war
between Aoun's men and the Syrians that lasted six months until the
Arab League arranged a truce Sept. 22.
   The general had led a Christian government, in competition with
a Moslem cabinet, since President Amin Gemayel's six-year term
ended in September 1988 with Parliament unable to agree on a
successor.

<HEAD>Paper Reports Security Breaches at Downing Street</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper reported Thursday it discovered
security breaches at the London home of Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher and other government leaders that leave them vulnerable to
terrorist attack.
   The report in the Daily Mail comes four days after a police
warning to public figures to take extra security measures following
attacks on the British mainland by the Irish Republican Army.
   The paper printed a picture that it said showed the view from an
easily accessible Foreign Office window overlooking the rear of
Downing Street, where the residences of Mrs. Thatcher and other
government members are located.
   ``This is the view which could put members of the Cabinet in the
sights of the IRA gang roaming Britain,'' the newspaper said.
   ``From this Foreign Office window, a sniper would have a
commanding position over the area around Downing Street,'' the
newspaper said. ``The prime minister herself could easily come
within range.''
   Mrs. Thatcher's official residence is at No. 10 Downing St.
   ``Even more alarming than the sniper's position was the
knowledge that a bomber could easily leave delayed action
explosives in exposed walls and floors while restoration work is
being carried out,'' the Daily Mail said.
   The story by Daily Mail reporter Paul Henderson said: ``All I
had to do to reach this ... vantage point to the rear of 12 Downing
St. was to walk past a single security officer and into an area of
the Foreign Office being renovated by workmen.
   ``I was not challenged. I needed no pass. And I remained inside
for 10 minutes taking pictures. All around there were the voices of
Irish workmen.''
   Irishmen building workers have for decades been prominent on
construction sites in Britain, and high unemployment in Ireland has
increased the number in recent years.
   A Foreign Office spokesman, who in accordance with British
practice declined to be identifed, said: ``I am aware of the
allegations. We will investigate any claim that there has been a
breach of Foreign Office security and we will look into it most
carefully. We take such stories very seriously.''
   Henderson reported the security lapse was pointed out by laborer
Tom Mansell who was working for a company of subcontractors
employed to clean stonework.
   According to Henderson, Mansell told him workers were entering
the Foreign Office by using security passes issued to other
tradesmen. Henderson said security passes were switched to avoid
having to go through lengthy checks.
   Commander George Churchill-Coleman, the head of Scotland Yard's
anti-terrorist branch, on Sunday told public figures in mainland
Britain and security force personnel to take extra security
measures in the wake of IRA attacks.
   The IRA claimed responsibility for planting a bomb found Nov. 14
outside the London home of Lt. Gen Sir David Ramsbotham, commander
of the British Field Army and inspector general of the reserve
army. The bomb was defused.
   The IRA also claimed responsibility for a bomb attack at the
garrison town of Colchester in eastern England on Saturday that
severed the legs of an army sergeant.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting British rule in
Northern Ireland. It wants to unite the predominantly Protestant
province with the mainly Catholic Republic of Ireland under
socialist rule.

<HEAD>Chess Team Arrives On First Commercial Flight From Moscow</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first Soviet commercial flight
landed here Thursday, bringing a Soviet chess delegation to play in
the European Chess Team Championship.
   The championship, which opens Friday in the northern port city
of Haifa, features teams from 26 countries, including East bloc
nations that have no diplomatic ties with Israel: Bulgaria, Poland,
Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union.
   The 46-member Soviet delegation includes some of the strongest
players of the past and present, among them grandmaster and former
world champion Mikhail Tal and women's world champion Maya
Zhiburdnidze.
   ``I'm happy to visit the country where I played 25 years ago,''
said grandmaster and former world champion Vassily Smyslov.
   One of the Soviet Union's best-known players and former world
champion Anatoly Karpov also arrived Thursday on a flight from
Madrid, Spain. Karpov will spend three days in Israel as a guest of
honor, but will not participate in the championship.
   World champion Gary Kasparov is playing in an individual
tournament in Belgrade, Yugoslavia.
   The Soviet guests brought about 20 boxes of chess supplies for
their Israeli colleagues. In exchange, the Israel Chess Federation
is covering hotel costs, officials said.
   At Ben-Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv, media attention was focused
on Aeroflot Flight 5515, the first such journey from Moscow to Tel
Aviv.
   ``I have flown to Cyprus, Yemen and Syria, but this is the first
flight to Israel, of course,'' said Capt. Oleg Agafonov. He was to
fly to Greece later Thursday because ``diplomatic problems''
prevented him from spending the night in Tel Aviv.
   The Soviet plane is scheduled to fly back to Israel Dec. 4 to
take the Soviet delegation home.
   The flight follows a tentative agreement between Aeroflot and
Israel's El Al Airlines on direct flights between Israel and the
Soviet Union, expected to start in January.
   Sports ties between Israel and most East bloc countries were
largely reduced when those countries cut diplomatic relations
following the 1967 Middle East War.
   The climate has warmed since Israel and the Soviets exchanged
diplomatic missions in 1987 and 1988. At present, Israel maintains
full relations with Romania and Hungary and low-level ties with
Poland.

<HEAD>Two Collaborators Killed; Soldiers Kill Palestinian</HEAD>

   A woman was shot to death in
the crowded Nablus market Thursday, and moments later masked men
paraded through the market and said through loudspeakers that she
was killed for collaborating with Israel.
   The 35-year-old victim was one of three Palestinians killed
Thursday in Nablus and in the nearby village of Beit Umrin. The
second Palestinian was shot in a clash with soldiers, and the third
was killed by a suspected collaborator.
   Shoppers scattered in fright through the narrow, crowded alleys
of Nablus' central market when Haniya Swissa was shot at about 11
a.m.
   Witnesses said a lone Arab walked up to the woman, asked if her
name was Swissa, and opened fire at close range when she replied,
``Yes.''
   Men in masks then marched through the crowd and accused her of
having cooperated with Israeli authorities.
   In a nearby alley, three youths from the Black Panthers, a group
blamed for killing at least 15 alleged collaborators, said the
group would kill anyone who works with Israel _ even Israelis, if
ordered to do so by PLO chief Yasser Arafat.
   ``Did you hear about the woman who was killed? Now is the time
to punish collaborators. When we have orders from Arafat, we'll
finish the others,'' said one youth.
   It was not clear if the three were involved in the market
slaying, but one pointed to a bulging bag he was carrying and said
it contained an M-16 assault rifle.
   Arafat has said the 23-month-old uprising against Israeli rule
of the West Bank and Gaza Strip should not become an armed struggle
against Israelis. He has refused to condemn killings of
collaborators but has called for caution in passing the death
sentence.
   People in Nablus say one such statement of caution was aimed at
the Black Panthers, who initially were aligned with Arafat's
mainstream PLO Fatah faction but later adopted a more independent
line.
   Ms. Haniya's death raised to 150 the number of Palestinians
killed by fellow Arabs during the uprising. Most have been accused
of informing on uprising activists or otherwise collaborating with
Israel.
   At least 616 other Palestinians have been killed by Israelis
during the uprising. Forty-two Israelis have been slain.
   In the clash with soldiers Thursday, troops shot and killed a
masked man who was among Palestinians stoning telephone workers in
Beit Umrin, a village northwest of Nablus, the army said.
   Arab reporters identified the victim as Mouhi Ghazi Hassoun, 21.
They said two other Palestinians were wounded in the clash.
   The other death Thursday occurred in Nablus. Arab reports said
an Arab accused of collaborating opened fire after his car was
stoned and shot to death a 35-year-old woman, Ferial Abdel Nabi.

   Grieving residents filled the narrow
streets of Liechtenstein's capital Thursday as the tiny
principality paid its last respects to Prince Franz Josef II.
   Franz Josef, who ruled for 51 years, died Nov. 13. He was 83.
   Prince Hans Adam II, who succeeded his father as head of state,
led mourners, including European royal families and government
leaders, at the 90-minute funeral in the small St. Florin Roman
Catholic church in Vaduz.
   In a sermon, Bishop Johannes Vonderach paid tribute to Franz
Josef's ``endurance, patience, trust and steadfastness.''
   The bishop read a message of condolence from Pope John Paul II,
expressing deep sympathy and recalling with gratitude his personal
meeting with Franz Josef. The pope visited the predominantly
Catholic country in 1985.
   Hans Adam, 44, and other close family members led the cortege
with the coffin out into the autumn sun. The coffin, draped with
red, blue and gold national colors, was lowered into the family
burial plot in the church grounds.
   The British royal family was represented by Princess Diana.
Queen Sofia of Spain, King Baudouin and Queen Fabiola of Belgium
and Crown Prince Willem Alexander of the Netherlands also were
among the royal mourners.
   Liechtenstein's two neighbors, Switzerland and Austria were
represented by their respective presidents, Jean-Pascale Delamuraz
and Kurt Waldheim.
   During Franz Josef's rule, the 61-square mile principality rose
from an underdeveloped country to a sophisticated industrialized
nation with one of the highest per-capita incomes in the world.
   He was the 12th ruler of the 270-year-old nation, the last
remnant of the Holy Roman Empire, and was popular among its 28,000
inhabitants.
   Despite his personal wealth, which included the family's art
collection of 1,400 Rubens, Van Dyck and other old master paintings
worth an estimated $150 million, he stuck to a simple lifestyle
that included Mass each morning.

   Suspected Sinhalese radicals killed a
South Korean engineer who tried to stop them from setting fire to
his company's vehicles, and 10 other people were killed in ethnic
violence, officials said Thursday.
   The military officials, who cannot be identified under briefing
rules, said Jun Her-choi was killed Wednesday in Kurunegele
district, 85 miles northeast of Colombo.
   At least 10 other people, including six suspected Sinhalese
radicals, were killed across the island nation in violence
associated with the Sinhalese uprising since Wednesday, they said.
   Jun was killed when at least 40 radicals attacked the offices of
Keanan, a South Korean road construction company, and began setting
vehicles on fire, the officials said. Jun, 32, tried to intervene
and was killed.
   At least 6,000 people have died since the uprising against the
Sinhalese-dominated government was launched by the radicals in July
1987. Only a few foreigners have died in the Sinhalese violence.
   In eastern Sri Lanka, at least four people were reported killed
in areas where a new Tamil militia has been attacking the
predominantly Sinhalese army and police force.
   Residents of Ampara, 125 miles east of Colombo, said two members
of the Tamil National Army were killed Thursday when the militia
exchanged mortar fire with the Sri Lankan army.
   The Tamil National Army claimed to have killed nine Sri Lankan
soldiers, but this was denied by military officials in Colombo.
   The officials said, however, that unidentified gunmen killed two
Tamil civilians Wednesday in Ampara.
   Sri Lanka's traditional conflict has been between the Sinhalese
majority and the Tamil minority, but the violence has turned into a
tangle of disputes.
   In 1983, Tamil guerrillas started their violent campaign for a
separate state in northeastern Sri Lanka, where most Tamils live.
In 1987, Indian peacekeeping troops were sent to the northeast to
enforce a peace pact.
   In the meantime, Sinhalese extremists were outraged by the
Sinhalese-dominated government's attempts to make peace with the
Tamils. Spearheaded by the radical People's Liberation Front, they
claimed too many concessions were being given to the Tamils.
   The front started assassinating government officials and
supporters.
   So far at least 11,000 people have died in the Tamil
insurrection, while another 6,000 have been killed in the Sinhalese
feuds.
   Sinhalese, who are mostly Buddhists, make up 75 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million people. Tamils comprise 18 percent and say the
Sinhalese discriminate against them in jobs and education.
   There also is a small Moslem minority that in the past two years
has come under attack from Tamil guerrillas.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Vote to Abolish Senate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers voted Thursday to abolish the
Senate as a prelude to establishing a unicameral Parliament by the
10th anniversary of independence next year.
   Only one legislator, opposition Zimbabwe Unity Movement leader
Edgar Tekere, opposed the amendment to the Constitution to scrap
the 40-seat upper house and expand the national assembly from 100
to 150 seats.
   Tekere, former secretary-general of President Robert Mugabe's
ruling Zimbabwe African National Union (Patriotic Front), has often
warned that Western-style democracy in Zimbabwe will be threatened
by constitutional changes.
   Mugabe has said the Senate, which automatically confirms
proposed legislation approved by the lower house, is outdated and
irrelevant.
   He has the support of all 40 senators, who back the ruling party.
   Tekere set up his unity movement as the only opposition movement
after he was fired from the ruling party last year for criticizing
fellow politicians for top-level corruption.
   The only other lawmaker in the legislature who is not aligned to
Mugabe's Patriotic Front, independent Goodson Sithole, voted in
support of the amendment.
   The bill required a minimum of 70 votes in the lower house, and
was approved on its third reading. The remaining legislators were
not in the house at the time.
   The Constitution was drafted by Britain, Zimbabwe's former
colonial ruler, 10 years ago during all-party peace talks to end a
seven-year guerrilla war led by Mugabe.
   A constitutional agreement signed by political leaders at the
time led to white-ruled Rhodesia's independence as black-governed
Zimbabwe on April 18, 1980, after nine decades as a Crown colony.
   The Constitution will be rewritten after the change has been
endorsed by the Senate, traditionally a formality, and Mugabe.

   Zsa Zsa Gabor left her Bel-Air
estate to go on a supermarket shopping spree to buy 100 turkeys for
the disadvantaged.
   The one-time Hungarian beauty queen, facing three days in jail
for slapping a Beverly Hills police officer, shivered in the frozen
food section Wednesday.
   ``Where are our turkeys? I'm getting cold. This place is
freezing. Where's the manager?'' the actress said.
   The turkeys were delivered to a Venice shelter that helps poor,
elderly and homeless people. Miss Gabor also donated 120 sweaters
and $200.
   Miss Gabor is appealing her conviction. As part of her sentence,
she must spend 120 hours performing community service work at the
center. But the shopping spree was not part of her court-mandated
charity work.
   The actress said the people who work with the homeless at the
center ``are some of the most wonderful, warm people I have ever
met in my entire life.''
   Miss Gabor also bought a stuffed orangutan doll, which she
promptly named Paul Kramer, after the policeman she slapped during
a traffic stop June 14.

<TEXT>
   About 300,000 people jammed
Wenceslas Square on Thursday to demand democratic reforms, capping
a week of unprecedented protest, but the military warned it stands
ready ``to defend the achievements of socialism.''
   Vaclav Havel, the nation's leading dissident, told the largest
rally yet to assemble in Prague: ``We will never return to the old
system of totalitarian rule.''
   Alexander Dubcek, the ousted crusader for reform, addressed tens
of thousands at an anti-government rally in Bratislava, his
hometown and the nation's second-largest city, the state CTK news
agency said.
   The highly popular Dubcek led the ``Prague Spring'' reform
movement, which was crushed by a Soviet-led invasion in 1968.
   In an apparent reference to those events, he called for a
renewal of society but warned protesters against making extreme
demands that could have ``tragic consequences.''
   Also Thursday, a top Communist official said the ruling party
would discuss personnel changes in the leadership at a meeting of
the of the Central Committee on Friday. In seven days of protests,
demands have mounted for the resignation of the hard-line
leadership.
   Havel called on the nation's military and police forces ``to
stand by the people for the first time.''
   But the military issued an entirely different message.
   In a statement carried by CTK, it said: ``We reject the anarchy
spread by anti-socialist forces from within and abroad. We actively
support the efforts of the Central Committee, the federal
government and the majority of our working people.''
   It added it was ``prepared to defend the achievements of
socialism.''
   Among the top military leaders said to have endorsed the
statement was Defense Minister Milan Vaclavik.
   Earlier, Communist Party chief Milos Jakes hinted he would not
suppress the demonstrations. He told a delegation of party and
trade union officials and coal miners the leadership ``will use
political means to halt the negative development in society,'' CTK
reported.
   Havel also told the crowd Thursday that ``we will never give up
our ideal of a free, democratic and prosperous Czechoslovakia no
matter what happens.''
   Taking aim at the Communist leadership, Havel said: ``We shall
see whether our country will reach democracy in a political way or
whether an isolated group of sadists will prevail, who want, at any
cost, to hide their power and privileges by empty words about
reform.''
   The crowd responded by shouting ``Resign!'' and ``Shame!''
   In addition to Prague and Bratislava, state media said there
were anti-government protests Thursday in the cities of Usci Nad
Labem, with 12,000 demonstrators; Plzen, which had 30,000; Hradec
Kralove with several thousand; Ostrava with 3,000; and Eanska
Eystrica with 5,000.
   Another activist, the Rev. Vaclav Maly, told the crowd that 500
businesses had expressed support for the opposition's call for a
work stoppage on Monday.
   Dubcek had been expected to speak at the Prague rally, but
stayed in Bratislava.
   Although some members of the ruling party have appeared anxious
to end the growing unrest by meeting with opposition and church
leaders, there are indications of a major rift within the party on
how to handle the biggest challenge to the government since 1968.
   Security police Thursday ordered top officials of the nation's
state-controlled TV not to broadcast live footage of the rally.
Police were posted at the station's central news office, said an
employee who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   On Wednesday, state TV did show footage of the protest that drew
200,000, but it was abruptly cut off after a worker interviewed on
the square accused the government of ``lying to us for 20 years.''
   In East Germany, where similar protests have triggered
substantial reforms, an official newspaper Thursday denounced East
Germany's role in the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia and said it
should now help its neighbor achieve change.
   In an open letter published in this week's Moscow News,
prominent Soviet writer Daniil Granin apologized for the invasion,
calling it ``illegal, ruinous intervention'' that brought to power
``dogmatic Stalinists.''
   Czechoslovak media carried a statement by the Prague section of
the official national youth organization calling for an inquiry
``by the highest party and state organs concerning people fully
responsible for the present situation.''
   The statement also called for an immediate parliament session to
discuss the growing unrest and demanded the debate be carried on
live TV.
   Meanwhile, a group of young party members in a Prague police
unit demanded ``necessary personnel changes'' in the ruling
Politburo to ``restore the effectiveness of the party.''
   Their statement, published in the youth organization's daily
Mlada Fronta, said confidence in the party had dwindled.
   The Communist leadership has rejected the kinds of reforms now
sweeping Hungary, Poland and East Germany.
   Communist leaders have denounced the protest rallies as
anti-socialist.
   The daily mass rallies began after police brutally broke up a
peaceful student protest Nov. 17.
   Protesters have alleged that a mathematics student was killed by
police during the rally. The government denies that.
   CTK reported that Sweden's foreign minister, Sten Andersson,
postponed a visit Friday during which he planned to award Havel the
Olof Palme Prize for public service. The news agency did not give a
reason or new date.

<TEXT>
   Fire raced through five Victorian homes
condemned after the Oct. 17 earthquake, drawing the attention of
arson inspectors and causing the evacuation of 30 nearby residents.
   Inspectors were investigating the fire, which raged for about
three hours in the pre-dawn along a residential block that had been
under an arson watch in the Mission District, said Fire Chief Fred
Postel.
   No one was injured, but one of the stately quake-damaged homes
collapsed.
   More than 140 firefighters using 26 pieces of equipment fought
the flames, and evacuated about 30 residents on the block behind
the fire, officials said.
   Firefighters had difficulty attacking the blaze in the cracked
and teetering homes, which were ``red tagged,'' or condemned after
the 7.1 magnitude earthquake that killed at least 67 people in
Northern California. Unable to enter the homes that had slipped off
their foundations, firefighters used cranes and other equipment to
fight the fire from outside, Postel said.
   One week afer the quake, neighbors along the block set up flood
lights across the street on a warehouse balcony, after two arson
fires did minor damage to one of the condemned buildings, Postel
said.
   Wednesday night was the first night since the neighborhood watch
began that the lights had been turned off, Postel said. Police also
had been making frequent patrols of the block, he said.
   ``The lights went out and the fire started,'' said Postel.

<TEXT>
   A man receiving $40,000 a year from a $1
million lottery jackpot has been charged with robbing a grocery
store and cheating customers at his recreational-vehicle business.
   Richard D. Smith, 30, who hit the state's lottery jackpot four
years ago, was charged Wednesday in Snohomish County Superior Court
with four counts of first-degree theft and one count of
first-degree robbery. He was free Thursday on bail.
   Smith, who has a prior conviction for bank robbery, was arrested
Sunday at a grocery story where a night manager told police that
Smith had tried to rob him at gunpoint.
   The suspect pulled a pistol and demanded cash as the manager was
getting change from the store safe, said Ken Murray, Everett police
spokesman.
   Smith's jackpot winnings will bring him about $40,000 a year
after taxes through the year 2005, said lottery spokesman Richard
Paulson.
   In the four theft charges, Smith is accused of cheating
customers who gave him campers to sell on consignment at his Mobile
Magic RV Center, Deputy Prosecutor James Townsend said.
   Smith sold at least $200,000 worth of campers without giving any
proceeds to the owners or titles to the purchasers, Townsend said.

<HEAD>Rakowski Criticizes New Goverment's Economic Policies</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS throughout with Walesa quotes, abolition of volunteer

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the Communist Party said
Thursday the Solidarity-led government's pro-market policies will
return Poland to capitalism and hurt the people, the official news
agency PAP reported.
   Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski, who led the government for nine months
until July, criticized the government of Prime Minister Tadeusz
Mazowiecki at a meeting of a special Parliament commission
investigating Rakowski's tenure as prime minister.
   ``The current government has announced a radical course and
economic decisions which will hurt, and badly at that. I cannot
reply how society will stand these blows,'' PAP quoted him as
saying.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa returned Thursday from a two-week
visit to the United States, Canada and Venezuela, and said Poland
was ready for foreign investment.
   ``For more than 20 years, the image of Poland was different and
people did not trust us,'' he told reporters. ``They thought we
were waiting here with a knife between our teeth, that we would
take away their capital and nationalize it.''
   Since the new government took over, ``Poland is a better place
for making business than the United States,'' he said. ``We have
done our best for better business'' and it is time for foreign
investors to take advantage of it.
   Rakowski accused the government of violating the ``round-table''
agreements on economic and political reform earlier this year.
   Those agreements led to legalization of Solidarity after a
seven-year ban and to partially free June elections in which the
independent trade union dealt the Communist Party a humiliating
defeat.
   After the Communist Party failed to form a government,
Parliament chose Mazowiecki, a former Solidarity editor and a
Walesa adviser, in July to lead a new Cabinet that ended more than
40 years of Communist rule.
   The government's economic program is market-oriented and calls
for changes in property laws that left many state enterprises under
the control of the Communist Party.
   ``It follows from the statements of some ministers of the
current government or the commentators associated with them, that
their goal is the return of Poland to capitalism,'' Rakowski said.
   ``As far as I remember, the new economic order which was
outlined at the `round table' did not envisage Poland's return to
capitalism.''
   The parliamentary commission has said the Rakowski government
ran the government into debt and contributed to Poland's current
economic difficulties. Rakowski says his government was not in
power long enough to do real damage.
   Another PAP dispatch said Parliament voted Thursday to disband
the paramilitary volunteer police force known as ORMO. Solidarity
lawmakers who proposed the legislation said the volunteer force was
``a relic of Stalinism.''
   Official reports put the strength of ORMO at 328,510, including
both Communist Party members and non-Communists.

<TEXT>
   Conservative Fernando Collor de
Mello holds a solid lead over leftist Luis Inacio da Silva in
Brazil's presidential race, according to a public opinion poll
released Thursday.
   It was the first poll released since Nov. 15 voting, when Collor
de Mello and da Silva finished one-two in a field of 21 candidates,
with 28 percent and 16 percent, respectively. No candidate received
a majority of the more than 82 million ballots cast, so a run-off
was set for Dec. 17.
   Collor de Mello of the rightist National Reconstruction Party,
former governor of the poor northeastern state of Alagoas, was the
choice of 50 percent of those responding in a survey conducted by
the Brazilian Institute of Public Opinion and Statistics.
   Da Silva, a federal congressman and ex-union leader, was backed
by 38 percent. He represents the Marxist-oriented Workers Party.
   The poll, published in the Rio daily newspaper O Globo, was
conducted between Nov. 20 and 22 and surveyed 3,650 people in their
homes. The margin of error was 3 percent.
   Seven percent were undecided and 5 percent said they would annul
their ballot. Voting is mandatory in Brazil.
   The December balloting will be the country's first direct
presidential election since 1960.
   Da Silva's leftist rival, Leonel Brizola, is expected to
formally announce his backing for da Silva shortly after the two
men meet Saturday.

   An electrician accused of torturing,
murdering and mutilating three women he picked up on highways was
found guilty Thursday on two of the three murder charges.
   The jury told the judge it was hung up on the second charge,
then returned the guilty verdict in 10 minutes.
   Steven Pennell, 32, was accused of killing the three women
picked up on a highway south of Wilmington between November 1987
and September 1988. The jury convicted Pennell of first-degree
murder in the deaths of Shirley Ellis and Catherine DiMauro, but
could not come to a verdict in the case of Michelle Gordon.
   The women were bound, tortured with electrician's tools, and
then mutilated. Pennell has been jailed since his arrest a year ago.
   The jury, sequestered since last Friday, was allowed to go home
until Monday. It must still decide whether to impose the death
penalty or sentence Pennell to life in prison without parole.
   The jurors originally told Superior Court Judge Richard Gebelein
they had been able to reach a verdict only on one count, but after
deliberating for another 10 minutes came back with verdicts on two
counts.
   Pennell did not display any emotion when the verdicts were read.
   Gebelein said he will declare a mistrial on the Gordon charge
and order a new trial on that charge.
   During the eight-week trial, prosecutors said the similarities
of the wounds suffered by all three women proved the murders were
committed by the same person.

   An East German court on Thursday convicted a
West German merchant seaman of spying on military facilities near
transit waterways and sentenced him to five years in prison.
   The trial against the West German, identified only as
24-year-old Peter S., was the first espionage proceeding open to
the public. The court also issued one of the lightest sentences
ever handed down in East Germany after conviction on spy charges.
   The Berlin Military High Court accused the West German
intelligence agency, the Bundesnachrichtendienst, of luring the
young seaman into espionage.
   There was no immediate comment from the West German government
in Bonn.
   Citing what it said was ``unscrupulous misuse'' of an
inexperienced man in debt, the court rejected prosecution calls for
a seven-year sentence despite finding the seaman guilty.
   The court said the sailor was paid about $160 per month for
intelligence gathered during passage through transit waterways that
flank East German territory.
   The defendant was said to have earned altogether about $6,000
over two years for spying, using the money to pay off debts.
   The case also marked the first time a West German charged with
espionage in East Germany was allowed to have with him at the trial
a diplomat from the legal affairs department of Bonn's Permanent
Representation in East Berlin.

   Four turkeys donned checkered napkins and
feasted on cranberries, corn and stuffed squash at a vegetarian
Thanksgiving dinner where they were the guests of honor instead of
on the menu.
   The turkeys sat down to dinner at the home of Dietrich von
Haugwitz.
   ``They're actually standing at the table,'' said Tom Giduz, who
with about 40 other people had gathered at Haugwitz's home for the
vegetarian dinner. ``It's a blue table cloth, and the turkeys
actually have red and white checkered napkins around their necks.''
   ``They're adding cracked corn to the top of the lettuce and
cranberries right now.''
   The event was part of a national Adopt-A-Turkey campaign by Farm
Sanctuary, an organization dedicated to halting animal agricultural
practices it believes abusive. The birds were rescued from factory
farms and slaughterhouses and brought to the group's shelter in
Delaware, then distributed to several states.
   Farm Sanctuary contends 80 percent of commercial turkeys are
raised in confined quarters with thousands crammed into one
building, where they are fed antibiotics and other drugs.
   As alternatives to the standard holiday fare, Farm Sanctuary
suggests some vegetarian dishes, not all of which may whet the meat
lover's appetites.
   They include chestnut soup, stuffed acorn squash and tofu loaf.

   Communist East Germany on Thursday lifted
bans on a dozen films it had called subversive since the mid-60s,
and President Egon Krenz attended one screening. A director said it
marked the end of cultural censorship.
   Director Frank Beyer, blacklisted for eight years after
authorities banned his film ``Trail of Stones,'' broke into tears
at a news conference with government officials.
   Krenz, who is also Communist Party chief, was among hundreds who
packed an East Berlin movie house Thursday night for the first
showing of ``Trail of Stones'' in 23 years. He applauded at the end
of the movie.
   The film focuses on a mason and the party official running a big
construction site where the mason works. Conflict erupts when the
workers are told to work harder without getting more materials.
   Officials said they expect to exhume many other films that ran
afoul of the party line over the years, including cartoons,
documentaries and TV productions.
   ``Today marks the start of publicly dealing with ... a terrible
intervention in arts and culture,'' said Horst Pehnert, the
government's deputy culture minister responsible for films.
   The action is among reforms that East German officials have made
since hard-line leader Erich Honecker was ousted Oct. 18.
   Most of the films were banned after a December 1965 meeting of
the Communist Party's policy-setting Central Committee that
included Walter Ulbricht, East Germany''s first leader, and
Honecker, who succeeded him.
   Beyer's film, considered among East Germany's finest, was pulled
back shortly after release in 1966, when authorities deemed it
defamatory toward the Communist system.
   The filmmaker was banned from making feature films for eight
years as punishment.
   Beyer, 57, broke into tears as he read the names of several
fellow cultural figures who were muzzled or forced to emigrate
under hard-line Stalinism, which he called ``the basic evil'' in
East German history.
   Ralf Richter, head of a new official commission investigating
censorship of feature and television films, said directors and
critics ``have tried for years to bring these films back to the
public'' but failed because no one dared to question official
``unscrupulousness and abuse of power.''
   The panel will proceed on the assumption that all film
censorship of the past was unjustified, he told reporters.
   He suggested the movies, though a quarter-century old, could
contain themes relevant to East Germany's current reform efforts.
   Tickets were sold out for Thursday night showing of ``Trail of
Stones'' at the 550-seat International theater.
   Officially sponsored rowdies disrupted the film's July 1966
premiere at the same theater. Days later, the film was banned under
a Culture Ministry order.
   Beyer credited the popular uprising that has forced a leadership
change and moves toward reform in East Germany for reviving freedom
in the nation's film theaters.
   Asked whether the end of cultural censorship was at hand, he
replied, ``Yes, I believe that is so.''
   Director Kurt Maetzig said he cried when he saw his ``I am the
Rabbit'' at a special showing Thursday. The film was never shown in
East Germany after its completion in 1965.
   Maetzig, 78, said he regretted an apology that he made to
authorites in order to continue making films.
   ``I did it in the hope of preventing the witch hunt back then,''
he said. East Germany also recently lifted a ban on several
anti-Stalinist Soviet films and the Soviet periodical Sputnik,
which published an article that East German authorities found
offensive.

<HEAD>U.N. Report Says Soviet Bloc Reform Improved Trade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet bloc reform helped increase East-West trade
this year and has set the stage for more economic integration in
Europe, says a U.N. report released Thursday.
   It also said structural problems and non-competitive industries
made prospects uncertain for further export growth in Soviet Union
and Eastern Europe.
   The report by the Economic Commission for Europe cited Hungary
and Poland as examples in urging more foreign investment as a spur
to economic liberalization. The commission is the only economic
forum bringing together Eastern and Western Europe, the Soviet
Union, United States and Canada.
   In its assessment, the 34-nation commission predicted the Soviet
bloc's debt to the West this year will remain at last year's level
of about $99 billion, with Romania's repayment of foreign loans
helping offset a predicted increase for the Soviet Union.
   Growth in East European exports to Western market economies
slowed to 4 percent in the first half of 1989 from 6 percent in
1988, slackening further as the year progressed, the report said.
   By contrast, after three years of stagnation, the increase in
imports by Eastern Europe shot up to 13 percent, mainly because of
more purchases by East Germany, Poland and Hungary.
   Despite increasing sales opportunities in the West, the report
said, poor commodity structure and declining competitiveness of its
manufactured goods made it uncertain whether Eastern Europe could
expand exports in the future.
   Sales of Soviet goods to the West grew by 9 percent between
January and June and imports increased 11 percent, it said.
   The Soviet trade deficit with the West increased in 1989 despite
favorable developments caused by the strengthening of oil prices
and the dollar, and the commission predicted a growth of the
deficit to more than $4 billion for the year, compared with $2.7
billion in 1988.
   It said the Soviet debt probably will increase by as much as $4
billion by the end of the year, to $28 billion.
   Turning to the Poland and Hungary, the report said the
approximately $5 billion in financial assistance offered by 24
Western nations probably will be supplemented by loans totaling $1
billion from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.
   Those loans in turn would open the way for more debt-relief
measures from Western creditors, to the tune of up to $6 billion,
it said.
   ``Further stimulation of direct investment flows would be most
desirable'' to increase production capacity which would allow the
loans to be repaid in the future, the report said.

   A storm moving across the Eastern Seaboard blanketed much of the
Northeast with a record Thanksgiving Day snowfall while bitter cold
gripped parts of the northern Plains and Great Lakes.
   Snow was piled as deep as 9 inches along the East Coast from
Virginia to Massachusetts and as far west as Ohio by Thursday as
the result of a low pressure system that moved northeastward across
the Carolinas during the night.

<TEXT>
   Former Chancellor Willy Brandt of West Germany
said Thursday that Western financial help to encourage reform in
East Europe must not be granted at the expense of development aid
to the Third World.
   In an opening speech at a two-day meeting of the Socialist
International council, Brandt described the changes sweeping the
Soviet bloc as the ``growing-together of Europe'' and called for an
all-European environmental agency as part of this process.
   He welcomed the European Community's ``awareness'' of the need
for more productive economic cooperation between East and West.
   The delegates also heard a call Thursday for a change in U.S.
policy toward El Salvador.
   ``The U.S. government must be requested to take on a more
constructive attitude to a political and not a military solution,''
said Hector Oqueli of the National Revolutionary Movement, a
Salvadoran opposition party.
   ``We are alarmed that the United States does not want
perestroika in satellite countries in Central America,'' said
Oqueli, referring to the reform fostered by Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev.
   He asked the right-wing Salvadoran government to begin new peace
negotiations with the leftist rebel movement to end fighting that
has killed more than 1,000 people in the largest guerrilla
offensive of the 10-year-old civil war.
   Brandt, president of Socialist International and the 1971 Nobel
Peace laureate, told the twice-yearly council meeting he had ``one
serious reservation'' about growing East-West cooperation.
   ``Many in the Third World express the fear that what is going on
... may mean a lessening of interest shown in the development
process of the South,'' he said.
   He spoke of the risk that Western money to help boost the
flagging economies of reforming East bloc countries might mean a
diversion of funds away from the Third World.
   A closed sesion of the council meeting is expected to discuss
membership bids from East European Social Democratic parties which
have traditionally operated in exile.
   The Social Democratic Party of Hungary, illegal until recently,
has applied for full membership of the international body, as has
Hungary's governing Socialist party.
   The East German Social Democratic party, set up last month, has
asked for observer status with the organization, Brandt said.
   Under Socialist International rules, only those parties
operating in a multiparty system can be full members.
   Nine East European political groups _ including the Social
Democratic parties of the Soviet republics of Latvia, Lithuania and
Estonia; the Hungarian and Czechoslovak Social Democratic parties
and the Polish Socialist party _ currently have consultative status
with the organization.
   Socialist International groups 89 socialist, social democrat and
labor parties worldwide. Delegates from about 60 countries are
attending the council meeting.
   They observed a minute's silence for victims of the Salvador
conflict and of Wednesday's bomb attack in Beirut that killed
Lebanon's new president, Rene Mouawad, and 23 other people.

   Thanksgiving was another day in the search
for a 9-year-old boy who disappeared a month ago riding his pony in
the canyons of south-central Oregon.
   The search will continue through the weekend, weather
permitting, search coordinator Phil Prince said by telephone from
Elmira. A storm moving into Oregon brought snow to the Cascade
Range north of the search area.
   ``They're working against the weather right now to get as much
done as possible,'' Prince said. ``The weather's the big factor ...
it's just kind of day-by-day right now.''
   Prince said families from the Veneta area near the home of the
missing boy, Nathan Madsen, sent turkey dinners to the 50 to 100
searchers in the mountains.
   The boy and his pony disappeared Oct. 22 during a family cattle
roundup near Cow Camp. The pony was found Sunday.
   Helicopters and up to 350 people converged on the area to search
for the boy in the days after his disappearance, but no trace was
found.
   The search intensified this week after the boy's father, Jerry
Madsen, found the pony Sunday while searching with several friends.
   Still missing are the pony's saddle and bridle, and Prince said
it was impossible to say whether the horse slipped out of them or
whether the boy or someone else took them off.
   He said foul play was not being ruled out in the boy's
disappearance.
   Prince said the remoteness of the area hampers the search effort.
   It takes searchers two hours to get to the search area each
morning after they gather at a restaurant northeast of Chemult.

   Charles Beck, the comic book artist who
created Captain Marvel, the superhero who came to life at the word
``Shazam,'' has died. He was 79.
   Beck, who died Wednesday at Shands Hospital, first drew the
``world's mightiest mortal'' nearly 50 years ago.
   The superhero in red tights quickly became Superman's rival for
the affections of American youngsters, and in the 1940s Captain
Marvel Comics sold more than 1 million copies a month.
   Born and raised in Zumbrota, Minn., Beck was encouraged to draw
from an early age by his parents, a Lutheran minister and a
teacher. ``All kids draw,'' Beck said in a 1986 interview. ``The
grown-up artist just sticks with it.''
   He started his career as an artist in Chicago, drawing cartoon
characters on lampshades, and later illustrated humor magazines in
Minneapolis.
   He went to New York with his publisher, Fawcett, in 1939 at the
beginning of America's comic book boom and just after Superman hit
the newsstands.
   Captain Marvel was a serial about Billy Batson, a 15-year-old
newsboy who transformed himself into Captain Marvel when he spoke
the magic word ``Shazam.''
   Many of the strip's situations involved Captain Marvel saving
the day by applying childlike solutions to world-threatening
problems created by adults. One story line had him being tickled
into helplessness by the evil Mr. Mind.
   Beck stopped drawing Captain Marvel in the early 1950s when
Fawcett shut down its comics operation, and he decorated awnings
and storefronts.
   In the 1970s he made a brief return to comics illustration when
DC Comics, the publisher of Superman, acquired the copyright to
Captain Marvel and began republication.
   Survivors include a daughter; a son; a brother; eight
grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.
   Funeral services will be Saturday in Lake Wales.

   An explosion on an oil rig in the Gulf
of Mexico early Thursday injured 12 workers, one seriously,
authorities said.
   ``Everything's secure, there's no blowout, there's no pollution,
anything like that,'' said Marshall Ballard, president of Penrod
Drilling Co. ``There's no one missing. There's no one unaccounted
for, there's no one dead, there's no fire.''
   The workers were taken by helicopter to John Sealy Hospital in
Galveston. Seven workers were treated and released and four were
listed in fair condition with cuts and burns, hospital spokesman
Rick Smith said. One was listed in serious condition with back and
chest injuries.
   Dallas-based Penrod operates the rig for Texaco. Smith
originally said four of the injured were Texaco employees, but he
said later that Texaco officials denied any of them worked for the
company.
   A Penrod official in Dallas said he had no information on the
accident. A call to Penrod's office in Galveston was not answered.
   The explosion occurred at 4:25 a.m. about 15 miles offshore, the
Coast Guard said.
   The cause of the accident was under investigation.

<TEXT>
   Albania's hard-line communist leader, in
a speech published Thursday, assailed reform-minded communists in
other Eastern European countries as revisionist and said his party
will not change its course.
   Ramiz Alia, in comments carried by the official Albanian news
agency and monitored in Vienna, said reform is lethal to orthodox
communism.
   ``Our party ... is convinced that only by abiding by the
ideology of the proletariat is it possible to march on the
socialist road,'' he said in an address to artists and scientists.
   Alia's remarks made clear his nation of 3 million people would
hew to the hard line that led it to break with the Soviet Union in
1961, leave the Warsaw Pact in 1968 and end an alliance with China.
   ``Revisionist'' Communist Parties in Eastern Europe have ``laid
the red carpet for the counterrevolution,'' he declared.
``Bourgeois ideologists are trying to attribute to the socialist
social order everything ... evil in world history.''
   ``As long as there exist capitalism and imperialism, there will
also exist exploitation, social injustice and ... oppression,''
Alia said. ``As long as there exist exploitation and oppression,
there will always be revolution and struggle for freedom, socialism
and communism.''
   Albania's course is right, he said, and ``every other
prescription is lethal ... to the destiny of socialism.''
   Romanian President Nicolae Ceausescu also castigated Communist
reformers at a party congress earlier this week.

<HEAD>Israel-South African Contracts Said to End in 1992</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American Jewish leader on Thursday quoted
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir as saying Israel's contracts with
South Africa will not be renewed when they expire in 1992.
   Seymour D. Reich, chairman of the Conference of Presidents of
Major American Jewish Organizations in New York, said that during a
U.S. visit this month the prime minister left officials and Jewish
leaders with the clear impression that the contracts would be
terminated.
   ``I think his statements to the effect that the contracts, when
they end in 1992, would not be renewed, satisfy the American Jewish
community,'' Reich told a news conference.
   However, Reich also quoted Shamir as telling President Bush in
Washington on Nov. 15 that Israel ``had some contractual
arrangements with South Africa he intended to adhere to and not to
break them.''
   Reports have suggested that Israel helped South Africa develop a
nuclear-capable, long-range missile using U.S.-developed technology.
   Israeli leaders strongly denied violating U.S. regulations in
providing the Pretoria government with American or U.S.-funded
military technology. They also denied helping South Africa acquire
a nuclear ability.
   In September 1987, Israel attached conditions to its relations
with South Africa, including a ban on all new investments and
government loans. That decision, however, exempted existing
contracts.

   In a season of political turmoil abroad and natural disasters at
home, Americans gathered to celebrate the bounty of the land on a
Thanksgiving that began with the first snowstorm in the East and
South.
   Thousands of victims of Hurricane Hugo, Northern California's
earthquake and tornadoes in the South found special reasons to give
thanks as they joined with neighbors and family.
   At Thanksgiving, ``some people who are expecting sadness find
joy and hope because people care,'' said Monroe Free, director of
the Union Rescue Mission in Knoxville, Tenn.
   ``This will be a very special Thanksgiving,'' said President
Bush in a Thanksgiving address that noted the changes in Eastern
Europe.
   ``But before our families sit down tomorrow, we will give thanks
for yet another reason: Around the world tonight, new pilgrims are
on a voyage to freedom and for many,'' said Bush, who is spending
the holiday with his family at Camp David, Md.
   Thanksgiving is also the sign that Christmas _ and the frenzied
shopping season, heralded by elaborate parades _ is ahead.
   High wind at Macy's 63rd annual Thanksgiving Day parade in New
York grounded the larger-than-life Snoopy and Bugs Bunny balloons.
The snow was the first to hit the parade since 1938.
   ``It's a white Thanksgiving!'' cheered Nora Deledansky, 12, one
of an estimated 1.8 million shivering spectators. About 55 million
people also saw the parade on television.
   Despite record snowfall in Philadelphia, the 70th annual
Thanksgiving Day parade came off, but not without a hitch. The
55-foot Humpty Dumpty balloon had a great fall when it was
punctured by a light standard.
   For five people, Thanksgiving was quite out of this world:
Discovery's astronauts were celebrating in space with
thermo-stabilized turkey, freeze-dried vegetables and cranberry
sauce.
   In a fall of tornadoes, a hurricane and an earthquake, it
perhaps was fitting that the first snowstorm hit the Northeast on
Thanksgiving.
   Up to 8 inches of snow fell on Cape Cod in Massachusetts, and 5
inches was reported at Snowshoe ski resort near Marlinton, W.Va.
Baltimore residents woke up to their first white Thanksgiving since
1971. ``All sorts of records, tons of records,'' said Harry
Woodworth, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Newark,
N.J., where almost 6 inches fell.
   Around Charleston, S.C., where demolished homes bear witness to
the hurricane that killed 29 people in September, volunteers served
an estimated 5,000 turkey dinners at 13 sites for hurricane victims
and the elderly.
   ``I think the world had gotten to the point where people were so
much for themselves,'' said Carole Allen of McClellanville, whose
house was badly damaged and workplace destroyed. ``I think this
happened to awaken people and make them realize there's more to
life than a bank account and a beautiful home.''
   In San Francisco, thousands of survivors of the earthquake that
killed more than 60 in October celebrated Thanskgiving with free
feasts and prayers of gratitude in virtually every neighborhood,
from the seedy Tenderloin to the upscale Marina.
   In Huntsville, Ala., Wayne Stinson and Wanda Clark were married
as scheduled _ but in the hospital where Stinson is recovering from
injuries suffered in a deadly tornado Nov. 15. ``I can't think of a
better day to get married. We decided that this did nothing to our
relationship but strengthen it,'' Clark said.
   In Virginia _ where the first Thanksgiving reputedly was held in
1619, more than a year before the Pilgrims had theirs in
Massachusetts _ Gov. Gerald L. Baliles invited the chiefs of the
state's eight Indian tribes to their first Thanksgiving dinner at
the governor's mansion. ``This is the one that we, the Powhatan
Indians, have been looking for since 1607,'' said Chief Webster
Custalow of the Mattaponi tribe.
   Thousands upon thousands of people who make their homes on
America's streets were invited to meals at churches and shelters.
Dinner for 8,000 was served at the 22nd annual Topeka Community
Dinner in Kansas.
   ``We just keep serving until there's nobody left to serve,''
said Grant Cushinberry.
   In Indianapolis, volunteers worked to feed about 25,000 people
in three counties. Twenty-nine New York City shelters served 15,000
turkey dinners. And the Salvation Army cooked for more than 13,000
people in the city.
   A group called God's Love We Deliver took gourmet meals to
homebound AIDS patients and their guests. ``We want to make sure
our clients have a wonderful meal and aren't spending it alone,''
said Daniel Stricker, God's Love's chief operating officer.
   Holiday celebrations had a different flavor in Los Angeles,
where The Laugh Factory served up holiday dinners to unemployed
comedians and a group of vegetarians hosted a live turkey while
supping on bread and grain-stuffed peppers.
   Some people recalled life in other places.
   After just six weeks in the United States, the Mai family from
Vietnam planned a traditional American celebration in Lincoln, Neb.
``I thank God for bringing my family here to freedom, happiness and
good health,'' said Suong Thi Mai, 23. ``Thanksgiving is a good
chance for refugee people to look back at all the good things they
have received.''
   Lions Club members from Indiana, Michigan and Minnesota left
Thursday in a caravan, headed to Guatemala with ambulances, medical
supplies, clothing, toys and used eyeglasses for people in that
Central American country.

these crimes.''
   The IPI claims more than 2,000 members among journalists,

   East Germany's Communist Party has opened a
disciplinary investigation against former leader Erich Honecker and
expelled one of his former top lieutenants from the party, state
media said Thursday.
   Also Thursday, Communist Party chief Egon Krenz told West German
TV he is ready to step down if that is the decision of next month's
party congress.
   ``I am not clinging to any personal power and certainly not to
any function,'' Krenz told ARD-TV.
   The East German state news agency ADN said the proceedings
against Honecker, former economic adviser Guenter Mittag and two
other former officials were based on ``grave abuses of the party
charter'' and ``responsibility for the current situation in the
party and the country.''
   Mittag was thrown out of the party, the announcement said. Last
month, he lost his seat on the ruling Politburo along with Honecker.
   East German officials already have said a parliamentary
commission was looking into charges of misuse of power and
corruption against Honecker and his inner circle.
   An earlier dispatch from ADN said doctors had decided that
Honecker was too ill to make any statements in the proceedings.
Honecker, 77, has had severe medical problems since a gall-bladder
operation this year.
   Krenz told ARD he had talked several times to Honecker by
telephone and that the former leader ``accepts that he is largely
responsible for this situation'' _ a reference to East Germany's
political crisis.
   Krenz also said Honecker was too ill to make any public
statements.
   The West German newspaper Bild reported Wednesday that Mittag,
63, was interrogated for 14 hours last week about reports he
stashed hundreds of millions of marks in Swiss banks.
   On Oct. 18, Honecker was replaced by Krenz after the worst
unrest in the nation's 40-year history and the exodus of tens of
thousands of East Germans dissatisfied with Honecker's years of
stringent rule.
   A special Communist Party congress next month is expected to
make more changes in the East German leadership. Krenz is expected
to meet with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany after that.
   Kohl had indicated he wanted to visit next month, but the East
German calendar has gotten so full that Kohl spokesman Hans Klein
told reporters in Bonn on Thursday that the chancellor will likely
wait until early January.
   The East Germany government announced earlier Thursday it will
send security agents into stores frequented by foreigners as part
of a major effort to stop the flood of goods over the newly opened
borders.
   The new measures will particularly affect Poles, who have been
pouring into East Germany and buying up subsidized items to resell
in their shortage-plagued homeland.
   Since East Germany opened its borders Nov. 9, the Communist
government has been wrestling with a growing black market and
smuggling on a scale not seen since before the Berlin Wall was
built in 1961.
   Government spokesman Wolfgang Meyer announced the anti-smuggling
measures at a news conference and said they will take effect Friday.
   The new measures do not address the smuggling of East German
marks, but Meyer ruled out devaluing the currency to make smuggling
less attractive.
   Meyer said the crackdown will include restricting sales of
certain goods, such as some clothes and foods, to East Germans and
to foreign workers living in the country.
   Most Polish people traveling between West Germany and West
Berlin won't be allowed to stop in East Germany, he said.
   In addition, Meyer said customs inspectors and internal security
agents, both plainclothes and in uniform, will be deployed in East
German stores frequented by foreigners to aid in the crackdown on
state-subsidized goods leaving the country. The customs force also
will be increased.
   He ruled out general searches of all travelers and insisted the
government has no intention of cutting back on the new freedom to
travel across the border.
   Meyer did not comment on the increasingly tense situation in
Czechoslovakia, which was the subject of a surprisingly candid
report Thursday in East Germany's government-run newspaper Der
Morgen.
   The newspaper denounced East Germany's role in the 1968
Soviet-led invasion that crushed a reform movement in
Czechosolovakia, and it said East Germany should help its neighbor
achieve change.
   For a week, thousands of Czechoslovaks have turned out for
pro-democracy protests in their country, where hard-line leaders
are resisting the East bloc reforms introduced by Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Despite the lifting of travel restrictions, thousands of people
continue to go West to live.
   West German officials said more than 40,000 East Germans have
arrived since the travel restrictions were lifted Nov. 9.
   As of Wednesday, nearly 11 million East German citizens had
received visas to travel to the West. East Germany has a population
of 16.5 million.

$20 from his ex-wife to feed the $1 slot machine.
   The Mirage was the real thing for Elmer Sherwin, who hit the
jackpot Wednesday night only nine hours after the Las Vegas strip
hotel-casino opened for business. He played a slot machine 90
minutes before coming up the big winner.
   Sherwin spent $80 of his own money, then borrowed $20 from
former wife, Florence, to continue playing, a Mirage spokesman said.
   The Las Vegas man hedged during a news conference Thursday when
asked whether he would remarry his former wife.
   ``She won't have me,'' Sherwin said.
   ``He said that, not me,'' piped up Florence, who said the two
were ``still buddies'' after divorcing 13 years ago following 25
years of marriage.
   The $4.6 million Megabucks jackpot _ which links slot machines
in dozens of casinos across the state to accumulate big jackpots _
was the largest payoff in Las Vegas history but didn't surpass the
Nevada record of $6.8 million won in Reno.
   The $630 million Mirage opened Wednesday at noon.

   President Alfredo Cristiani
rejected a guerrilla cease-fire proposal Thursday and said an
11-day rebel offensive had been defeated, but small bombs went off
nearby during the news conference.
   The renewed proposal by the leftist guerrillas for a negotiated
cease-fire was ``propaganda,'' the right-wing president told a
large gathering of reporters at military headquarters.
   Shortly after the news conference began, suspected rebels
apparently tried to steal the show by setting off at least five
small bombs in a ravine about five blocks away. A military officer
said the explosives were ``guerrilla home-made bombs.''
   The news conference continued as helicopters roared overhead,
dropping bombs and rocketing the slopes of a volcano in apparent
retaliation.
   Cristiani, who was surprised but maintained his composure, said
the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front tried to spark a
popular uprising to topple the government.
   ``They tried it and lost,'' said Cristiani. He said the FMLN had
to ``come to its senses and stop its aggression against the people.
Then we can sit down to look at the few things we can do to
facilitate their incorporation into the democratic process.''
   Hopes that talks would begin under the auspices of Venezuelan
President Carlos Andres Perez were dashed with the announcement
that only guerrilla officials would meet with Perez.
   Cristiani said the guerrillas had used the peace process for
propaganda purposes while preparing the 11-day offensive that began
Nov. 11.
   The guerrillas had virtually the entire foreign press corps for
an audience when they set the small bombs. Cristiani jumped, but
kept talking, telling everyone ``not to worry.''
   At one point he knocked over a chair as he reached for a
cigarette, and several times he mopped his brow. The conference was
held in an open-air pavillion at military headquarters, which has
been attacked numerous times during this nation's 10-year civil war.
   The guerrillas had already proved their ability to launch
attacks anywhere in the city, and Cristiani said ``anybody with a
small group of people'' could launch ``terrorism.''
   Fighting Thursday flared in Apopa, eight miles north of the
capital. Soldiers were ambushed while buying soft drinks at a
roadside stand but suffered no casualties. Dozens of government
troop-carrying helicopters came and went from an air base near the
city and the air force bombed a hillside near Apopa.
   San Salvador's 1 million residents worked to clean up after the
rebel offensive and return the capital to some semblance of
normality.
   People lined up for gas, food and medical supplies. At the
Soyapango cemetery east of the city, gravediggers buried five
bodies that had been left at the cemetery gates and said they
expected more work.
   Truck driver Israel Herrera stood in a line of 50 people at a
natural gas distributorship in Soyapango, saying he ran out of the
fuel a week ago.
   ``We've been cooking with wood,'' he said. ``Since I don't have
any fuel for the truck I'm spending my days in line.''
   Fighting in San Salvador ended Wednesday morning after 12 U.S.
Army Green Berets left the Sheraton Hotel that had been seized by
rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front.
   The hotel is not now part of the U.S.-based chain.
   On Wednesday night the FMLN renewed its cease-fire proposal but
included language the government rejected earlier, saying a
cease-fire had to be ``defined.''
   Rebel-government meetings in September and October foundered on
that point.
   ``They have always tried to change what it means to have a
cease-fire,'' said Sandoval, who repeated the government position
that any truce should begin at once, with details to be arranged
later.
   The rebels, who amended their proposal Thursday to say they
would ``cooperate'' in negotiating terms of a cease-fire, say that
a cease-fire without terms works only for the government.
   The guerrilla proposal also asked that the armed forces be
represented at the talks, another demand rejected previously. The
rebels say the army holds the real power.
   The guerrillas said they launched their offensive to persuade
the Cristiani government that they could not be defeated and would
have to be taken into account if the country was to have peace. The
10-year-old insurrection has cost about 71,000 lives.

   Discovery's astronauts reportedly
put a spy satellite in orbit Thursday to complete the main task of
their secret mission before a Thanksgiving meal of irradiated
turkey and freeze-dried vegetables.
   There was no official confirmation from NASA or the Pentagon,
but sources close to the project said the 2{-ton, $300 million
payload was released from the shuttle's cargo bay about 10 hours
after Wednesday's dazzling nighttime liftoff.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
satellite was capable of monitoring Soviet missile tests and
eavesdropping on military and diplomatic communications in the
Soviet Union and other countries.
   They had no information on how well the satellite was operating.
A similar satellite was launched by a shuttle crew in 1985.
   A military-imposed news blackout surrounding most of the flight
was lifted briefly Thursday evening when NASA announced that the
shuttle would land Sunday night at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
   Mission Control commentator Billie Deason said Discovery is
scheduled to return to Earth at about 7:02 p.m. PST.
   ``The crew is doing well and the orbiter continues to perform
satisfactorily,'' she said in the brief status report.
   The five crew members, meanwhile, continued to whirl around the
Earth, their words heard only in secure control centers in Houston
and Sunnyvale, Calif.
   Because of the nighttime launch, the astronauts were to have
slept until early afternoon EST, and then were to have celebrated
Thanksgiving with a feast of turkey, vegetables and cranberry sauce.
   With the satellite deployed, the crew could turn attention to
experiments for the ``Star Wars'' missile defense system and other
military projects.
   The commander is Air Force Col. Frederick D. Gregory, and his
crew is made up of Air Force Col. John Blaha, the pilot, and three
mission specialists: Navy Capt. Manley Carter Jr., F. Story
Musgrave and Kathryn C. Thornton.
   A blazing 700-foot tail of engine fire illuminated the night as
Discovery darted toward orbit Wednesday. The sky was so clear
people at the launch site could see the exhaust for 7{ minutes, out
to a distance of more than 600 miles.
   ``It was 100 times brighter than a star,'' said Glenna Milberg,
a TV reporter in Miami, 200 miles south of the launch center. ``It
looked like a Roman candle.''
   The shuttle's ascent provided a spectacular view over a large
part of Florida, but clouds obscured the visibility for the rest of
the Southeast.
   It was the third after-dark liftoff in 32 shuttle missions, and
the time was dictated by the secret cargo and its mission.
   The satellite was to be maneuvered into a stationary orbit
22,300 miles above the equator, with line-of-sight to the Soviet
Union, China, the Middle East, Africa and all of Europe.
   The flight is the fifth shuttle mission dedicated solely to the
military. The Pentagon said the secrecy is necessary to make it
more difficult for the Soviets to track the shuttle and learn its
purpose.

   A Tel Aviv judge on Thursday ordered the
Israeli newspaper Hadashot and three editors to pay fines totaling
$1,000 for violating censorship rules in reporting a 1984 bus
hijacking.
   Hadashot reported at the time that the government had begun an
investigation into the killings by the Shin Bet secret service of
two guerrillas captured after the hijacking.
   The judge upheld a complaint from the government Censor's Office
that the paper violated regulations by revealing the investigation
without getting the censor's approval.
   Editor Yossi Klein said he would appeal.
   An Israeli woman and two Palestinian hijackers were killed in
the hijacking of an Israeli commuter bus. Two Palestinians were
captured and later beaten to death.
   A government inquiry found the Shin Bet was involved in the
beating deaths and a subsequent cover-up. The head of the Shin Bet
and others involved were given a presidential pardon and were not
prosecuted.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Soldiers arrested 15 people,
including three human rights activists and a former senatorial
candidate, while the militants were visiting peasants in a small
southern town, sources said Thursday.
   Marc-Elie Blanc, attorney for the League of Former Political
Prisoners huamn rights group, said the arrests occurred Wednesday
in Anse-a-Pitre, on the south coast border with the Dominican
Republic.
   The two countries share the island of Hispaniola.
   Among those arrested were the local League chapter head, Levoy
Wilcinot, and Guy Bauduy, a civic leader and former senatorial
candidate in the violently aborted November 1987 elections, Blanc
said.
   The League has frequently accused Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril's
government of human rights abuses.
   ``We are looking into the matter,'' said an Information Ministry
official in an interview, speaking on condition of anonymity. He
did not elaborate.
   Blanc said nine of those arrested were peasants whom Bauduy and
the activists were visiting.

   The Grinch began the Christmas season

   Thieves stole 180 bundled Christmas trees from a parking lot
Wednesday. Independence Boy Scout Troop 747 had planned to begin
selling the trees on Friday and use the proceeds to send its
members to camp next summer.
   ``We're just sick at heart,'' said Debbie Camerlynck, the

   The trees were bought for $4,200, she said.
   A witness said two men loaded the trees into a pickup and drove

<TEXT>
   Hungary and the Vatican have agreed to resume formal
diplomatic relations after a 44-year hiatus, a leading Hungarian
official said Thursday.
   Hungary would become the second Warsaw Pact country to establish
ties with the papal state since Pope John Paul II's native Poland
did so in July.
   ``The two sides agreed ... that no obstacles exist to resuming
diplomatic relations in the imminent future,'' said Barna Sarkadi
Nagy, head of the government's secretariat for church affairs,
after three days of talks with Vatican officials. He gave no date.
   The Vatican made no immediate comment, but officials have
previously indicated a resumption of diplomatic ties was possible
with Hungary, which has enacted democratic reform in recent months.
   Nagy, speaking at a news conference at the Hungarian Embassy,
said a Vatican delegation will travel to Hungary next month or in
early January to conclude the negotiations.
   The next round of talks, he said, will be to decide on the final
text of notes the two sides will exchange when relations are
re-established. The meeting will also allow Vatican officials the
chance to choose headquarters for their envoy in Budapest, the
Hungarian capital.
   The rapprochement with Hungary marks another sign of the steady
improvement in Vatican relations with the East bloc, underscored by
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's scheduled meeting with the
pope next week.
   Hungary broke relations with the Vatican in 1945, expelling the
Holy See's envoy from Budapest. The two sides resumed contacts in
1964, but Nagy said the turning point came this year when Hungary
embraced a program of democracy, human rights and religious freedom.
   Nagy said Roman Catholics make up the largest religious group in
Hungary, comprising about 36 percent of the total population of
10.6 million.
   A major issue of contention between Hungary and the Vatican has
been the case of the late Hungarian Cardinal Jozsef Mindszenty, who
was tried by the government in 1949 and convicted of treason. The
church said the charges were false and the trial rigged.
   Mindszenty was freed from prison by Hungarian revolutionaries
during the 1956 anti-Soviet uprising and took refuge in the U.S.
mission in Budapest when Soviet tanks crushed the revolt. He left
his asylum in 1971 under an agreement with the Vatican and died in
Vienna in 1975 at age 83.
   Nagy said government authorities are re-examining the case and
are expected to announce their findings soon.

   A mother and two young children
were presumed drowned Thursday in the Gulf of Mexico after their
small plane crashed in heavy seas that snatched an infant from his
father's arms as he swam to an oil rig.
   Two other men were killed near Forth Worth when their acrobatic
plane apparently stalled during a nose dive and crashed,
authorities said.
   The U.S. Coast Guard called off its search Thursday afternoon
for Sophia Mifsud, 26, her daughter, Ariel, 3, and 2-month-old son,
Martin, Lt. Mark Kasper said. ``We are presuming the three have
drowned,'' he said.
   The woman's husband, pilot Thomas Mifsud, 32, reported the
engine failed on his single-engine Cessna 210 Wednesday evening. He
ditched the plane into the Gulf about 100 feet upwind of an
unmanned oil rig platform, said Coast Guard Lt. Robin Starrett.
   Mifsud managed to get everyone out of the plane and began
swimming toward the rig with the baby while his wife grabbed the
3-year-old.
   ``He was hit by a real large swell and lost the baby,'' Starrett
said. ``He saw the wife and the daughter go by.''
   Mifsud made it to the oil rig and tried to throw a life
preserver to his wife and daughter, but apparently missed, Starrett
said. The life preserver was recovered Wednesday night.
   The plane went down about 30 miles south of Palacios, a coastal
community about halfway between Corpus Christi and Galveston.
Rescuers had expanded the search beyond the site where the plane
went down to account for drift caused by 32 mph winds and waves
measuring up to six feet, said Petty Officer Ron Atteberry.
   Mifsud is a U.S. citizen living in Guatemala, Atteberry said.
The plane was en route from Brownsville to Houston.
   Mifsud was treated and released from a Corpus Christi hospital.
   In the Fort Worth suburb of Azle, a 55-year-old pilot and his
42-year-old passenger died when a two-seater biplane crashed, Cpl.
Roland Real of the Texas Department of Public Safety said. Their
names were withheld pending notification of relatives.
   The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the
accident, a spokesman said.

<TEXT>
   Archbishop Robert Runcie of Canterbury
said Thursday that churches in Eastern Europe must not seek to
replace crumbling communist parties as instruments for ideology.
   In a speech to the European Parliament, Runcie also urged the
assembly to continue to question capitalism.
   Runcie heads the Anglican Communion, a global family of churches
with 70 million members. He is also the spiritual leader of the
Church of England and president of the British Council of Churches.
   ``While it looks as if at the moment communism has lost the
battle for hearts and minds in Europe, it certainly cannot be said
that capitalism as a total world view has won,'' Runcie said.
   He said recent ``events in East Germany are as much a
vindication of Protestantism as are the events in Poland of
Catholicism.''
   Yet churches there ``should not seek to replace the Communist
party as an organ for ideological purity.''
   ``Christian faith is not an ideology,'' the archbishop said.
   Runcie said that despite recent democratic reform in Eastern
Europe, ``we must not shut our eyes or close our ears to the world.
... No Europe (is) worthy of the name if it is not open to the
world.''
   He cautioned against seeing the changes in Europe as an all-out
victory for capitalism.
   The nearer capitalism ``comes to triumphing totally, the more
questions are raised about its capacity to be magnanimous in
victory, to heed the cries of the poor at home and abroad, to seek
the paths of peace and to care tenderly for the Earth,'' Runcie
said.
   He said urgent solutions must be found to global environmental
problems.
   ``We are part of our environment. If it dies, so do we,'' he
said.
   Runcie said churches have had to add to the struggle for justice
and peace, the fight for the environment, the fight for ``the
integrity of creation.''

   Residents of much of the East woke up to a rare white
Thanksgiving, with record amounts of snow causing traffic headaches
for holiday travelers.
   ``We are certainly starting our winter season off with a bang,''
said Jim Poirier, a meteorologist in New York.
   Snow fell overnight from Virginia to New England and was
expected to end Thursday, though Friday was expected to be cold.
   ``All sorts of records, tons of records'' were broken, said
Harry Woodworth, a weather service meteorologist in Newark, N.J.,
where nearly 6 inches fell in less than 24 hours, breaking the
Thanksgiving record of 4 inches set in 1938.
   It was only the fifth time in 65 years that measurable snow fell
in Boston on the holiday. The 4.4 inch snowfall was the heaviest on
record for Thanksgiving there since 1925. New York City received
its first white Thanksgiving in 51 years.
   Most people already were at their Thanksgiving destinations by
the time the snow hit, said Sgt. Dominick Evangelista of the Port
Authority, which oversees Kennedy, La Guardia and Newark airports.
There were delays at Bradley International Airport in Windsor
Locks, Conn., but no cancellations.
   No one was hurt in a seven-car pileup on an expressway in New
York City, and Connecticut and New Hampshire police reported only
minor accidents.
   In the coastal town of Duxbury, Mass., police worked double-time
to free families stuck in their cars.
   ``We can't even get the cruisers out of the yard!'' said
Patrolman Phil P. Thayer. ``You come in to work on Thanksgiving
because it's part of the job, but getting caught by surprise like
this sort of undermines morale. We're just gritting our teeth and
trying to get through.''
   Thanksgiving Day high school football games were canceled in
many communities. But parades went on in New York City and
Philadelphia.
   Six to 8 inches of snow fell along the southern New Jersey
coast, and 3 to 8 inches were recorded in southern New England,
where Cape Cod felt the brunt of the storm. Maryland and Delaware
reported 4 to 6 inches of snow.
   Up to 8 inches were recorded in two days in metropolitan New
York. A snowfall of 4.7 inches Thursday was a record for Nov. 23,
breaking the 1897 record of 2.3. Thursday's snowfall was a record
for Thanksgiving Day, breaking the 1938 mark of 3.9 inches.
   Thanksgiving snow on top of the dozen-plus inches of snow that
fell this week in New Hampshire was good news for skiers. Two ski
areas opened Monday, two more hoped to do so Thursday, and other
ski areas planned to open Friday.

   Sen. John Glenn is a fitting grand
marshal for the 1990 Rose Parade regardless of his role in an
influence-peddling investigation involving the nation's costliest
savings and loan failure, organizers said.
   A recent editorial in the Pasadena Star-News said residents were
questioning the Ohio Democrat's choice because of recent
disclosures about Lincoln Savings and Loan Association.
   ``We at the Tournament are not getting into that at all,'' Don
Fedde, Tournament of Roses president, said Wednesday. ``He's an
American hero who's distinguished himself during the past 50
years.''
   Glenn is one of five senators who received a total of $1.3
million in political contributions from Charles H. Keating Jr.,
owner of Lincoln's parent company. The FBI and a private counsel
for the Senate ethics committee are investigating whether the
senators improperly pressured regulators to sidetrack an
investigation of the thrift.
   All five lawmakers have denied any wrongdoing. Lincoln was taken
over by the government this year and is expected to cost taxpayers
more than $2.3 billion.

   An unmanned barge carrying 5 million
gallons of jet fuel drifted for more than a day near the site of
the Exxon Valdez spill before a tug roped the vessel Thursday, the
Coast Guard said.
   At one point the 400-foot barge drifted within 1{ miles of a
reef but did not run aground, Guard spokesman Ted French said.
   The barge broke loose from a tug in stormy weather Tuesday
afternoon 20 miles south of Cape St. Elias in the Gulf of Alaska,
near the entrance to Prince William Sound. Coast Guard officials
said they do not know why the barge broke free.
   A tug skipper reported the incident to the Coast Guard in Valdez.
   The crew of a Coast Guard plane spotted the barge Wednesday, and
a Guard helicopter dropped a radio buoy with a strobe light onto
it, French said. By early Thursday, the tug that reported the
incident had the barge on a towline and was taking it to Port
Etches on Hinchenbrook Island about 10 miles away, the Guard said.
   Once in port, hook-up adjustments will be made to tow the barge
about 360 miles to Anchorage, its original destination, Guard
spokesman John Baker said. The Guard initially said the destination
was Whittier, about 100 miles away, but Baker said that report was
mistaken.
   Ten-foot seas had prevented crews from making the hook-up
adjustments in open waters, Baker said.
   Before the barge was brought under tow, officials had considered
bringing in an Army ordnance team to blow up the barge and burn off
the fuel to prevent it from running aground and spilling its cargo.
   The barge went adrift about 20 miles south of Prince William
Sound, where the Exxon Valdez hit a reef on March 24 and spilled
nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil, the worst spill in U.S.
history.
   The barge is owned by Crowley Maritime Corp. of Seattle.

   Tammy Bakker spent Thanksgiving at the
Federal Medical Center with her imprisoned husband, TV evangelist
Jim Bakker.
   Mrs. Bakker, a native of Minnesota who now lives in Orlando,
Fla., arrived Thursday with the couple's son, Jamie, and an
unidentified woman. She said she hoped for a good Thanksgiving,
``in spite of the circumstances.''
   The visit, which lasted slightly more than six hours, was Mrs.
Bakker's first since her husband was transferred to the
prison-hospital on Nov. 3.
   ``It's been several weeks since we've seen each other because
the trip from Orlando to Minnesota is a long way,'' Mrs. Bakker
said. ``So we're very glad on Thanksgiving to be able to be
together.''
   Asked how her husband was doing, she said: ``As well as can be
expected. He's a tough man.''
   ``He told me he loves me,'' Jamie Bakker said.
   John Chreno, executive assistant to the warden, said the Bakkers
spent their time in the visiting area but did not have Thanksgiving
dinner together because visitors aren't allowed in the cafeteria
and no food can be brought in.
   Bakker was sentenced to 45 years for defrauding followers of his
PTL ministry of $3.7 million.

   A traffic jam did what the courts
wouldn't _ turn off the lights Thursday at a giant Christmas
display at Domino's Pizza Inc.'s headquarters.
   The 1.5-mile drive-through light display at the company's
headquarters attracted thousands of motorists, said Lt. Craig
Swenson of the Washtenaw County Sheriff's Department.
   ``Once it started to back up ... that's when it became apparent
that we had to do something about it,'' Swenson said.
   The lights were turned on at 5:30 p.m. and voluntarily doused by
Domino's officials at 6:45 p.m., Swenson said. Officials had first
tried two substitute traffic plans designed to alleviate the
problem.
   This year's light display opened Tuesday after a judge ruled
unconstitutional an Ann Arbor Township ordinance used to deny
Domino's a permit for its Christmas show.
   Residents complain that traffic to the light show clogs roads
and hampers travel to and from their homes.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher rebuffed an
unprecedented challenge to her leadership of the governing
Conservative Party by saying in an interview published Friday she
is ready to fight two more general elections.
   The Times of London quoted her as saying this week, ``By popular
acclaim (in the party) I am happy to carry on.''
   The paper described it as an astonishing move by the 64-year-old
Mrs. Thatcher, who on Thursday flew to the United States for talks
with President Bush.
   She came to power when the Conservatives won the 1979 general
election. She is now in her third term after Conservative victories
in the 1983 and 1987 general elections.
   But her government is increasingly unpopular, due in part to a
7.3 percent annual inflation rate, interest rates at 15 percent,
planned changes to the free National Health Service and a widely
disliked new local government tax.
   The Conservatives now trail the opposition Labor Party by up to
13 points in opinion polls.
   Mrs. Thatcher's standing as party leader was badly dented when
Nigel Lawson resigned as Chancellor of the Exchequer and Sir Alan
Walters resigned as her personal economic adviser, both on Oct. 26.
   They quit following a row between them over currency strategy.
Lawson was incensed by Mrs. Thatcher's refusal to heed his demands
for her to sack Walters after the row blew up.
   The Times said the interview with the prime minister was
conducted this week but did not state the day.
   It said Mrs. Thatcher's announcement that she is ready to fight
two more elections can be expected to goad her opponents in the
party into new determination to challenge her leadership.
   The next general election is due by mid-1992, the one after by
mid-1997. In October 1997 Mrs. Thatcher will be 72.
   Deputy Prime Minister Sir Geoffrey Howe joined party chairman
Kenneth Baker and Tory elder statesman Lord Whitelaw on Thursday in
denouncing attempts to unseat her.
   They were reacting to an announcement Wednesday by rank-and-file
Tory legislator Sir Anthony Meyer that he will challenge Mrs.
Thatcher for the leadership when she comes up for her annual
re-election.
   Meyer conceded he was an outsider with no chance of defeating
her but said he would go ahead with his candidacy unless a
higher-profile nominee emerged.
   Meyer said he hoped to provoke sufficient abstentions to send
her a message of disenchantment and possibly lure a major
challenger into the race if it goes to a second round of voting.
   Howe and Baker are regarded as possible Thatcher successors, but
both made clear their distaste for a contest.
   No Tory has run against Mrs. Thatcher since she became party
leader 14 years ago. But lately, economic troubles, her prickly
personality and her resistance to deeper British integration into
the European Economic Community have stirred dissent in the party.
   Party rules require the leadership election to be held by Dec.
19. She must win the votes of at least 57 percent of the 374 Tories
in the House of Commons to win outright.

   Six wild turkeys disappeared from a back yard
Thursday morning, leaving police wondering whether the birds were
kidnapped or simply made a last, mad dash for freedom.
   ``We really don't know if they just ran away 'cause they knew
what was going to happen to them Thanksgiving Day or if someone
took off with them,'' said Officer Richard Gray.
   The turkeys disappeared between 5:30 a.m. and 6:30 a.m. from
Thomas J. Walsh's back yard in the San Fernando Valley community of
Northridge, Gray said.
   The only clue was a trail of feathers over the fence.
   ``We may never know what happened,'' Gray said.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of supermarket shopping carts
held hostage by the city were released this week after the Southern
California Grocers Association agreed to donate food to the needy.
   The City Council passed an ordinance about a year ago allowing
its crews to impound shopping carts left on streets and sidewalks
in Glendale, just north of Los Angeles. The city would return the
carts, worth up to $100 each, only after stores paid a $15 fee.
   The city had collected about 800 abandoned shopping carts. The
two biggest supermarket chains affected, Ralphs and Vons, would
have had to come up with about $4,000 each to get theirs back.
   Councilman Larry Zarian suggested the city waive the fee if the
stores donate food to Glendale's charitable organizations.
   ``It's appropriate during this holiday season to give to the
poor and needy,'' he said.
   Grocers Association President Steven Koff said details of the
food donation plan haven't been worked out.
   Meanwhile, the council passed a law Tuesday allowing free return
of carts to markets that agree to test a cart-control system for 90
days. The electronic system is designed to automatically lock the
wheels of carts taken off a grocery store's property.

<TEXT>
   Officials threw out thousands of
parliamentary election ballots Thursday as the governing party and
the opposition traded charges of fraud, voter intimidation and
violence. Forty-eight people have been killed.
   The election commission also ordered an investigation into
charges of widespread vote-rigging in the constituency where Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi is seeking re-election on the ticket of his
Congress Party.
   Security forces braced for more violence in the 10 states and
two federally ruled territories that began voting Friday, the
second of the three-day polls.
   Authorities in particular feared violence in northern Bihar, an
impoverished state with a reputation for corruption and ``fistfight
democracy.'' Polls opened Friday in Bihar and voting was to
continue on Sunday, the last day of the election.
   At least 92 people, including three independent candidates, have
been killed since elections were announced Oct. 17, the ninth since
India won independence from Britain in 1947.
   Gandhi appealed to Indians to refrain from violence in the final
two days of voting.
   ``There is no place for violence in our democratic system,'' the
prime minister said a news conference in Uttar Pradesh, where he
went to see a former ally critically wounded in a shootout a day
earlier. He later called off the visit, fearing tensions with
opposition supporters.
   The National Front, a loose-knit coalition of five opposition
parties, accused Gandhi and his Congress Party of engineering the
violence.
   ``His intentions are most suspect and he is up to all kinds of
mischief, including murder _ of individuals and democracy,'' said
Yashwant Sinha, a spokesman for the Janata Dal (People's Party),
the main force in the National Front.
   Gandhi, who was propelled to power hours after the 1984
assassination of his mother and predecessor, Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi, has been the main issue in the monthlong campaign. The
opposition's plank has centered around the 45-year-old prime
minister's alleged corruption and ineptitude.
   The Congress Party has sought to portray the elections as a
choice between stability and chaos, maintaining the opposition's
newly found unity will quickly shatter if it is voted to power. But
opinion polls show Gandhi and his party are in serious trouble and
in danger of losing.
   At stake are 524 of the 543 seats in the Lok Sabha, or House of
the People, the law-making lower house of Parliament. Several races
have been postponed because of incomplete voter rolls and
candidates' deaths.
   Voting ends Sunday, but the results are not expected until
Sunday night and Monday.
   The Election Commission tossed out thousands of suspected
fraudalent ballots cast Wednesday at more than 600 polling booths
in six states and sent a team to investigate charges of vote fraud
in the Amethi constituency, where Gandhi is facing Raj Mohan
Gandhi, the grandson of India's beloved independence leader
Mohandas K. Gandhi.
   Anand Sharma, the Congress Party's chief spokesman, labeled the
opposition charges as ``another orchestrated drama to malign the
prime minister'' and ``a smokescreeen to cover the brutal and
ferocious assaults'' by the opposition.
   Among those injured in Wednesday's violence was Sanjay Singh, an
opposition leader who was Gandhi's campaign manager in the December
1984 elections. He defected to the opposition two years ago with
his wife's uncle and the man expected to become prime minister if
the opposition wins, Vishwanath Pratap Singh.
   According to the National Front, Sanjay Singh was wounded during
a shootout Wednesday during voting in Amethi constituency, a remote
rural area in northern Uttar Pradesh state. Two opposition workers
also were wounded, one of them seriously.
   The prime minister said he had asked the Uttar Pradesh
government to thoroughly investigate the shooting but denied
Congress Party workers were responsible for the shooting.
   ``It is not in the interest of the party to introduce violence
in the polling because the majority of voters are voting for us,''
he said.
   Sanjay Singh was unconscious and in critical condition at a
hospital in the state capital of Lucknow following a three-hour
operation to remove bullets from his stomach.
   ``He is still with us, but hovering between life and death,''
Sinha told a news conference in New Delhi.
   L.C. Jain, the campaign manager for Raj Mohan Gandhi, said
Congress Party ``goons, hoodlums and gangsters took over polling
booths'' in Amethi constituency and stuffed ballot boxes. He and
other opposition politicians and supporters asked the Election
Commission to invalidate the ballots and order another poll.
   Sharma, the Congress Party spokesman, dismissed the request.
``The people have voted. There is no need to interfere,'' he said.
   Election Commissioner R.V.S Peri Sastri said a special team had
been sent to Amethi to investigate allegations of vote rigging.
   ``We will withyhold the results from Amethi until the inquiry is
completed,'' said Sastri, who noted the commission had received
complainits of fraud and violence ``from almost all'' the 221
constituencies that conducted polls Wednesday. No date was set for
the new polls.

<TEXT>
   President Carlos Andres Perez on
Thursday prepared to meet with Salvadoran guerrilla leaders as a
possible mediator in peace talks.
   Perez conferred with officials of President Alfredo Cristiani's
right-wing government earlier in the week and told reporters
Thursday a meeting with leftist rebel leaders in Caracas could take
place within hours and ``possibly tonight.''
   However, shortly before midnight Perez told reporters at
Miraflores Palace that leading guerrilla delegates were to arrive
in Caracas ``at dawn, and we will meet immediately after.''
   Perez earlier Thursday described the 11-day guerrilla offensive
in which more than 1,000 people were killed a ``horrible
bloodbath,'' but he said an evenhanded approach was necessary to
achieve recognition in El Salvador.
   ``It can't be possible that Latin America will take a step back
with the latest developments in El Salvador, when we are about to
see the whole region covered with democratic regimes,'' he said.
   ``I will say the same things to the representatives of the
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front that I said to the
ministers of the Cristiani government: We need to look for sincere
solutions,'' Perez said.
   Leftist guerrillas have fought U.S.-supported governments in El
Salvador for a decade and 71,000 people have been killed, most of
them civilians.
   The Venezuelan president said a cease-fire should be a
precondition to peace talks and cautioned against increased U.S.
military involvement.
   Latin Americans ``we have to know how to respond on our own and
solve our own problems,'' he told a news conference at the
presidential palace.
   Members of the palace guard surrounded the presidential beach
retreat of La Guzmania, in the port city of La Guaira north of
Caracas, where the conference presumably would be held.
   Unconfirmed reports said one of the rebels attending would be
Shafik Handal, said to be their top military strategist.
   Guerrilla and government delegations met earlier this year in
Mexico and Costa Rica and agreed to resume negotiations in Caracas
this week. The guerrillas broke off talks earlier this month to
protest the bombing of a union hall in El Salvador that killed 10
people, and began their offensive Nov. 11.

   Pop music star Yana, who first sang in public on a
dare and went on to become one of Britain's most popular singers in
the 1950s and 1960s, died of cancer of the esophagus Nov. 21. She
was 57.
   Yana, whose real name was Pamela Guard, launched her career in a
London nightclub when friends dared her to get up and sing. The
nightclub owner was so impressed with her voice that he booked her
for a cabaret act.
   She became a top recording star, taking a number of singles to
the No. 1 spot on the British charts. Perhaps her best-known song
was ``Climb Up the Wall.''
   In 1956, she had her own BBC television show. She also appeared
in lavish stage shows in London's West End. Her movie debut was in
1955, with Jose Ferrer in ``Cockleshell Heroes.''
   Her career peaked in 1958 in the first of many appearances on
the top-rated TV variety show ``Sunday Night at the London
Palladium,'' but faded with the new pop music styles of the '60s.
   Her last stage show appearance was in 1983, and the following
year she was featured in the TV show ``Where Are They Now?'' about
stars who have faded from the public view.

   A regional prosecutor said Thursday he
has decided not to indict five executives of a government-owned
arms company for illegally exporting anti-tank weapons.
   Prosecutor Ulf Barck-Holst said in a statement that the five
current or former managers had reason to believe that the
government was aware of the sales, and that consequently he could
not prosecute them for violating government regulations.
   Neutral Sweden has strict regulations forbidding the sale of
weapons to countries at war or in areas of conflict. All sales must
be approved in advance by the government-appointed war materials
inspector.
   A report by Sweden's attorney general in February showed that
since 1963, Forenade Fabriksverken (FFV) circumvented the rules by
exporting weapons via London through an agreement signed with the
British Defense Ministry.
   With Great Britain as a middleman, FFV sold the Carl Gustaf
anti-tank grenade launcher to several countries in Africa and the
Middle East for 20 years.
   The attorney general in his report said he expected the five
executives to be prosecuted. But Barck-Holst said that they ``had
reason to believe that the so called England-agreements were known
to the government.''
   Barck-Holst also was investigating FFV's alleged export of the
Carl Gustaf to Cambodia via Singapore.

   A paraplegic shot his estranged wife and
a neighbor's two children, killing one child and leaving the other
critically wounded, before taking his own life Wednesday, police
said.
   The gunman, identified as Charlie Tanner, about 40 years old,
was found dead of self-inflicted gunshot wounds when police entered
the apartment, authorities said.
   Tanner, his wife Jessie, the couple's unidentified 9-year-old
son, and two children of a neighbor were in Mrs. Tanner's house
when police believe an argument broke out around 5 p.m..
   ``My understanding is that Charlie shot his wife, she ran out of
the house with her son, they ran across the street to a food store
and called the Plant City police,'' Hillsborough County Sheriff's
spokeswoman Debbie Carter said.
   Jennifer Stark, 8, was found dead at the scene, Ms. Carter said.
Her brother, 10-year-old Justin, was shot in the head and taken to
Tampa General Hospital, where he was listed in critical condition.
   The Starks were identified by police as the neighbor's children.
   Mrs. Tanner, who was shot in the back, was listed in serious but
stable condition at Tampa General, according to the nursing
supervisor on duty.
   McDaniel said the Tanners were either separated or divorced. He
refused late Wednesday to speculate on the cause of the shooting.

   Images of families still struggling after the ravages of the
California earthquake and Hurricane Hugo in the Carolinas brought
new meaning this year to the day Americans feast and give thanks
for the nation's plenty.
   While millions sat down to turkey dinners at home, many others
celebrated the holiday by sharing with the less fortunate: the
thousands trying to get back on their feet after natural disasters,
the homeless in the cities, the destitute overseas.
   Around Charleston, S.C., where shattered homes still bear
witness to the hurricane that killed 29 people Sept. 21 and 22,
volunteers will serve up 5,000 turkey dinners at 13 sites for
hurricane victims.
   In San Francisco, the annual Thanksgiving meal for 6,000
homeless people at Glide Memorial Church took on new significance.
The earthquake that killed 67 and did $7 billion in damage Oct. 17
deepened the plight of the homeless by toppling or damaging the
cheap hotels where many take shelter.
   Nationwide, families settled down to their turkeys _ 45 million
birds, according to the National Turkey Federation _ and a
television diet of parades and football, including two National
Football League games.

   Eastern Airlines pilots are calling off their

blow to Machinists on strike against the carrier since March.
   The leaders of Eastern's union pilots voted Wednesday to end
their walkout, although it remained unclear whether Eastern would
welcome back all of the more than 2,200 pilots still on strike.
   The decision by the Air Line Pilots' Association instantly
crushed the solidarity of the strike begun by the Machinists and
until now supported by the pilots and union flight attendants.
   The Machinists vowed to continue their walkout.

failed'' to require proof that his case was untainted by his
immunized testimony to Congress.
   In court papers filed Wednesday, North's lawyers say he was
prosecuted in ``stunning disregard'' for his Fifth Amendment rights.
   ``North's six days of compelled testimony were carried live ...
and reprinted ... with Pearl Harbor headlines,'' said the court
papers.
   A 1972 Supreme Court ruling prohibits prosecutors from using
immunized testimony.
   North was convicted of aiding and abetting an obstruction of
Congress, destroying government documents and accepting an illegal
gratuity. The former Marine was at the heart of the Reagan
administration's effort to arm the Nicaraguan rebels during a
congressional ban on U.S. military aid to the Contras.

<HEAD>Ski Industry Tries To Lure New Skiers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As skiers around the nation prepare to hit the
slopes, resorts, retailers and equipment-makers are working on new
strategies to introduce non-skiers to the spirit of the sport.
   The message to the public is that skiing can be safe and
exciting, that the costs are exaggerated and that a vacation
doesn't even have to include schussing down a mountain.
   ``We used to sell ski vacations,'' said Peggy Wedd, a
spokeswoman for Aspen Skiing Co. in Aspen, Colo. ``Now we sell
winter vacations.''
   According to industry estimates, the number of skier visits has
grown about 5 percent over five seasons to 53.3 million this past
year. One skier visit represents one person visiting a ski area for
any part of a day.
   ``There's a feeling that we're not growing as much as we would
like to see,'' said Bernard Weichsel, program administrator for SKI
USA, an international marketing firm for U.S. ski resorts.
   ``The industry is not about to die,'' he said. ``But we want to
undertake a massive effort to get new people.''
   This fall, the National Ski Areas Association joined forces with
Ski Industries America, which represents manufacturers and
distributors of ski equipment, to form the United Ski Industries
Association. This new umbrella group has launched a multi-million
dollar marketing campaign to try to attract new skiers.
   ``It's a sign of a maturing industry that it must have a well
thought out strategy,'' said Weichsel, who was in Boston recently
for a ski show. ``It's not being done as an act of desperation.''
   The campaign is aimed at the millions of Americans who are
considered to be sports and outdoor enthusiasts but who have never
skied or have tried the sport but did not continue.
   Resorts, however, are not relying on the campaign to attract new
clientele.
   The Stowe resort in Vermont is offering people who have never
skied a beginning lesson for $40 that also includes a season pass
for use on a ski lift that serves the beginner slopes.
   ``What our hopes are is that they will get a lot of mileage out
of this and clearly come back to ski,'' said Gary Kiedaisch,
president and general manager of Mount Mansfield Co., which owns
Stowe.
   ``We really want them on the hill and experiencing the sport,''
he said.
   At Aspen, officials have started marketing the resort by placing
advertisements in non-skiing magazines. The ads show simple
mountain scenes instead of skiers blasting through deep powder.
   ``We went more for the natural beauty of the area,'' Wedd said.
   ``Sometimes you have a couple where one person skis and one
doesn't,'' she said. ``Both can come and have fun.''
   By using the area's non-skiing attractions as bait, the resort
hopes people who don't ski will come to Aspen and then decide to
give the sport a try.
   Part of the goal is to overcome perceptions that skiing is too
expensive or too dangerous.
   Christopher Leake, vice president of merchandising for The Ski
Market Ltd. Inc., a chain of ski stores in the Northeast, said
while equipment can cost hundreds of dollars, beginners are
encouraged to rent equipment and purchase items one step at a time.
   Lift tickets can run more than $30 for the day. But Leake noted
that interest in golfing has exploded in recent years despite green
fees that are even more expensive.
   Finally, regarding the ``fear factor,'' Leake said, ``there's
also that general exhilaration factor. ... We're trying to
demonstrate that this is a lot of fun.''
   If the marketing effort pays off, some ski areas could find
themselves with an overload of customers, Weichsel said. ``A lot of
major areas are maxed out.''
   But Stowe's Kiedaisch said his resort has excess capacity and
has planned for a surge in beginner skiers. ``We won't get blind
sided,'' he said.

   Stock prices closed sharply higher Thursday,
bolstered by better-than-expected British trade figures for October.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index jumped 28.2
points, or 1.3 percent, to close at 2,220.5.
   The Financial Times 30-share index finished 19.7 points higher
at 1,754.1. The Financial Times 500-share index gained 11.73 points
to close at 1,215.79.
   Volume still was a modest 362.2 million shares, although better
than Wednesday's 324.2 million shares.
   London's advance was largely fueled by the trade report, which
showed that Britain's merchandise trade deficit narrowed to a
better-than-expected $2.9 billion in October from a revised
shortfall of $3 billion in September.
   The financial markets had expected a gap of $3 billion.
   Dealers said the news eased worries that a widening of the trade
deficit would quickly translate into a sharp drop in sterling and
trigger another rise in British interest rates, which already stand
at 15 percent.

<TEXT>
   The scandal that forced a prime minister from
office and has bedeviled the governing party for more than a year
finally surfaces in court Friday, with issues that cut deeply into
the structure of Japanese society.
   In trying those charged in the Recruit scandal, prosecutors must
show when a gift becomes a bribe. The determination by the court
could become a severe test of the close links between business and
government in Japan.
   The answers won't be known in full for years, given the slow
pace of justice in Japan.
   ``The Recruit case is not just another political corruption
trial but it is a challenge to the way Japan Inc. is set up
today,'' said Hiroshi Itakura, professor of criminal law at Nippon
University, using a term that refers to the close postwar
cooperation between business and government.
   ``For those implicated in the case, it is almost as if they were
doing what everyone else was doing, and one day they woke up and
found themselves being criminal defendants in one of the largest
bribery cases in history,'' he said.
   The scandal centers on an ambitious entrepreneur, Hiromasa Ezoe,
who showered senior politicians and bureaucrats with huge donations
and discounted shares in a subsidiary of his conglomerate, Recruit
Co.
   Because the alleged corruption was so widespread, the scandal
caused public uproar and forced Noboru Takeshita to step down as
prime minister in June. Takeshita was found to have received $1.4
million in questionable yet legal donations from Recruit.
   The scandal drove dozens of powerful men out of the political
limelight and directly contributed to the governing Liberal
Democratic Party's unprecedented defeat in an election for the
upper house of Parliament in July.
   The party still is struggling with the influence-peddling
scandal ahead of elections expected early next year for the more
powerful lower house. The trials starting in Tokyo District Court
raise the possibility of further damaging disclosures.
   After an eight-month investigation by the Tokyo District Public
Prosecutor's Office, two politicians, six bureaucrats and four
Recruit executives, including Ezoe, were charged with bribery,
which carries a maximum five-year prison sentence.
   Five separate trials will start between Friday and Dec. 15, with
the first involving Takashi Kato, a former vice minister of labor,
and Masao Tatsumi, a former Recruit executive. Tatsumi is charged
with bribing Kato with 3,000 shares in a Recruit subsidiary to help
Recruit's publishing business.
   Defendants whose trials start later include Takao Fujinami, a
former chief Cabinet secretary, and Hisashi Shinto, ex-chairman of
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp., Japan's largest company.
   Analysts say prosecutors are likely to encounter difficulties in
substantiating bribery because sending gifts and donations to
politicians and bureaucrats is a common business practice.
   The Japanese exchange gifts not only on special occasions like
birthdays and holidays, but also are virtually required to bring
something when only visiting friends.
   Guests commonly give $140 to $210 at weddings or funerals.
College students often give gifts to professors. According to a
1988 survey, an average Japanese family spends $1,040 a year on
gifts.
   ``If you are a Japanese and visit your friend empty-handed, your
friend will probably think you are strange if he does not get
offended,'' said Tetsuro Murobushi, who has writen many books on
political corruption.
   ``The question in the Recruit case is whether a clear
distinction between bribe and gift can be established or not.''
   Japanese companies can legally make up to $210,000 in political
donations a year, and they have skirted this limit by buying
tickets to politicians' fund-raising parties. Companies also treat
politicians and public officials to dinners and golf outings.
   Corporate managers say such treatment is not aimed at winning
specific favors but to keep close relations with supervising
agencies and politicians, who may make their business easier in the
long run.
   ``In Japan, gifts function as a lubricant between business
partners, neighbors, teachers and students and politicians and
businessmen,'' said Itakura.
   ``Strictly speaking, all of them are bribery by Western
standards and I personally think it's not a desirable custom,'' he
said. ``But if you are a businessman and if you don't send gifts
while everyone else does, you are likely to end up losing business
to your competitors.''

   International Business Machines Corp. confirmed
it has cut radiation emissions in its newest large-computer
terminals and will make similar changes in future personal
computers.
   IBM said Wednesday there was no evidence that electromagnetic
radiation from video display terminals was a health hazard, but
said it took the step because of demand from customers,
particularly in Europe.
   The step was applauded by 9 to 5, National Association of
Working Women, which along with other groups has expressed concern
that radiation from VDTs might contribute to birth defects.
   Scientific evidence about the health risk of VDT radiation has
been inconclusive. A federally funded study on 8,000 women office
workers at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City is
aiming to resolve persistent questions.
   Electromagnetic radiation is different from and generally less
harmful than the ionizing radiation of X-rays.
   Although IBM is often a pacesetter, other computer makers said
they had no immediate plans to follow the lead of the world's
largest computer company.
   ``We haven't seen a groundswell of demand for products that have
lower emissions and we haven't seen any strong evidence that
there's a link between the use of VDTs and various health
concerns,'' said Nora Rice, a spokeswoman for Compaq Computer Corp.
in Houston.
   IBM found a way to cut radiation from display terminals and
incorporated the technology into its InfoWindow displays for
mainframe and mid-sized computers, which were introduced in
September.
   The company mentioned the radiation reduction in its European
press materials but not in the U.S. press materials.
   IBM plans to incorporate the technology into future personal
computers as well, said Paul Snayd, manager of IBM's VDT and
Ergonomics Project Office. He said he could not say when those
products might reach the market. Some analysts have predicted a new
PC or workstation from IBM next year.
   IBM will not retrofit existing computers because it believes all
are safe, Snayd said.
   Customers in Sweden and Denmark began demanding lower-radiation
displays after a 1986 conference in Sweden on the health effects of
non-ionizing radiation, Snayd said. The demand later spread
throughout much of Europe, he said.
   ``I would classify it in the U.S. as being an emerging customer
requirement,'' Snayd said.
   He said the InfoWindow displays meet the Swedish standard of a
20- millitesla magnetic field at a range of 50 centimeters. He said
typical personal computers give off from 20 to 200 milliteslas.
   Ellen Bravo, 9 to 5's associate director, said she hoped other
computer manufacturers would follow suit. IBM's move was also
praised by companies that offer products to protect against
radiation.
   ``I think it's been a long time coming and I am delighted,''
said Michael Hiles, president and chief executive of NoRad Corp. in
Santa Monica, Calif., which makes radiation shields for PCs.
   Safe Computing Co. of Needham, Mass., offers a flat-panel screen
that does not give off any electromagnetic radiation.
   ``No one knows what level of exposure is harmful. And when
there's zero-radiation technology available, that should be the
obvious choice for people that are concerned about the radiation,''
said Allen Nitschelm, the executive vice president.

   Economic and political reforms in the Soviet bloc
have helped boost East-West trade this year and set the scene for
greater economic integration in Europe, a U.N. report said Thursday.
   ``The many new developments _ the more relaxed political
atmosphere, further progress in economic reform _ clearly indicate
that East-West economic relations are entering a new phase,'' said
the report, prepared by the Economic Commission for Europe.
   These relations ``have been characterized by an unprecedented
confluence of developments set in motion by economic and political
reforms under way in a number of Eastern countries,'' it said.
   But the report warned that structural problems and uncompetitive
industries made prospects uncertain for continued increases in
exports from the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
   The Economic Commission for Europe predicted that the Soviet
bloc's net indebtedness to the West in 1989 would remain at last
year's level of about $99 billion, with Romania's repayment of
foreign loans helping to offset a predicted increase in the Soviet
Union's debt.
   The 34-nation Commission is the only economic forum bringing
together Eastern and Western Europe, the Soviet Union, the United
States and Canada.
   Growth in East European exports slowed to 4 percent in the first
half of 1989 from 6 percent in 1988, the report said.
   By contrast, after three years of stagnation, the increase in
the volume of imports by East European countries shot up to 13
percent, mainly due to higher purchases by East Germany, Poland and
Hungary.
   The report warned that despite increased opportunities to sell
goods to the West, the declining competitiveness of manufactured
goods makes further expansion of exports from East Europe uncertain.
   East Europe's net indebtedness, however, was expected to decline
$2 billion in 1989 to $71 billion partly because of the
appreciation of the U.S. dollar.
   Sales of Soviet goods to the West expanded by 9 percent between
January and June, while the growth of imports increased to 11
percent. Imports continued to grow in the third quarter of the
year, although exports fell back markedly, the report said.
   The Soviet trade deficit with the West widened during 1989
despite the favorable price developments caused by stronger oil
prices and a higher U.S. dollar.
   The report called for more measures to encourage foreign
investment.

<HEAD>BAT Buys Back More of Its Shares</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   BAT Industries PLC, the British conglomerate
fighting a hostile $21 billion bid from Hoylake Investments Ltd.,
said Thursday it has acquired more shares under a plan to buy back
up to 10 percent of its stock.
   BAT said it purchased 4 million shares on Wednesday for roughly
$48.7 million.
   The buy-back program is part of a major, shareholder-approved
restructuring to fend off Hoylake's bid by enhancing BAT's shares.
   Late last month, BAT bought 6 million of its shares but was
barred from making further purchases until the release of the
company's third-quarter earnings report on Wednesday.
   BAT has authorization to buy 153 million of its shares.
   Under the restructuring, BAT intends to focus on tobacco and
financial services. The conglomerate plans to sell off its U.S.
retailing operations, including its Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall
Field's stores, among other businesses. The sales are expected to
raise $6.3 billion.
   Last week, Hoylake, which is led by Anglo-French financier Sir
James Goldsmith, announced that it was considering launching a
revised, $13.35-a-share bid for BAT.
   The Hoylake bid has technically lapsed pending U.S. regulatory
approval.

   Investor George Gillett has been forced to extend
the restructuring of $507 million in junk bonds for troubled SCI
Television Inc. because of a weak response from Wall Street, the
company and investors said.
   SCI said in a brief statement Wednesday that virtually none of
its bondholders agreed to swap their high-interest debt for a
39-percent non-voting stake in the company.
   SCI said investors holding just $37,000 of the $507 million in
debt had agreed to Gillett's offer. SCI extended the deadline until
Dec. 4 and said further extensions are possible.
   If the restructuring fails, Gillett Holdings, which has a 55
percent share in SCI, could forfeit its $100 million investment in
the company, which it owns with the New York buyout firm Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.
   SCI owns TV stations WSBK in Boston, WJBK in Detroit, WJW in
Cleveland, WITI in Milwaukee, KNSD in San Diego and WAGA in Atlanta.
   Gillett also owns the Vail and Beaver Creek ski resorts, but he
has said he will not sell the resorts.
   Gillett had proposed extending some loans and cutting the
interest rates on publicly traded SCI bonds in exchange for the
non-voting stake in the company, but bondholders have said they
want more equity and faster repayments.
   The company is continuing talks with a bondholder's committee
and other debt holders.
   According to sources quoted Thursday by the Denver Post,
investors said Gillett either will pull off the restructuring or be
forced to sell more assets.
   Gillett had tried to sell SCI's Cleveland station earlier this
year but called off the deal because of a weak market.
   Last week, three SCI bondholders filed an involuntary bankruptcy
petition against SCI at the end of a 30-day grace period after
Gillett failed to meet an Oct. 15 interest payment.
   A Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition would require the company to
sell off its assets to satisfy creditors. The company has 20 days
to respond to the petition.

<HEAD>New Soybean For Livestock</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first soybean that can be fed
directly to livestock will be on the market in 1991, and overseas
shipments may contain a few red, white and blue beans to promote
U.S. farmers.
   Researchers at the University of Illinois this week announced
the development of the new ``Kunitz'' soybean, which requires no
expensive processing for use as animal feed.
   It could save livestock producers 13 to 14 cents a bushel,
increase soybean demand in countries with limited crushing
facilities and raise the price paid to farmers for beans, said
Lloyd Anderson of the Illinois Soybean Checkoff Board.
   ``Kunitz offers ... countries the opportunity to improve
production efficiency and the standard of living for their
people,'' said Anderson.
   The key is the lack of a substance called the trypsin inhibitor
in the new soybeans.
   The trypsin inhibitor prevents livestock from efficiently
digesting the protein in soybeans. Until now, beans had to be
processed and toasted to cook out the trypsin inhibitor.
   But university plant geneticist Theodore Hymowitz, whose work
was funded with about $230,000 from Illinois soybean farmers,
identified a South Korean variety that lacked the trypsin inhibitor.
   Using genetic engineering, Hymowitz combined traits from the
Korean soybean and the Williams 82, a commercial U.S. variety.
   ``The seeds are identical with the exception that the Williams
82 has the trypsin inhibitor and the Kunitz bean does not,'' said
Hymowitz.
   Preliminary tests at the university showed that yields of the
Kunitz soybean are as good as popular varieties now grown by U.S.
farmers.
   Hogs gained weight as fast eating corn and unprocessed Kunitz
soybeans as they do eating corn and processed soybean meal. Poultry
feeding trials yielded similar results.
   ``It will be used by domestic hog producers and by exporters who
will send it to countries like Russia, where there are no
processing facilities, and farmers could feed it directly to their
hogs,'' said Peter Salm, a plant breeder at Illinois Foundation
Seed, Inc.
   The Urbana-based company will raise Kunitz soybeans next season
to multiply the volume of seed, and commercial farmers should be
able to grow the new soybean in 1991.
   Salm said the new soybeans may be sold overseas in bags that
contain a few beans that have been tinted red, white and blue so
customers know they are getting a unique product from U.S. farmers.
   ``There are a whole variety of ways to market specialty crops,''
said Salm. ``We don't do a good job of that now.''
   Soybeans now are crushed at commercial processing plants, where
soy oil _ used in products like salad dressing and margarine _ is
separated from soy meal.
   The high-protein meal is mixed with corn and other grain and fed
to hogs, chickens and turkeys. None of them can digest the protein
in raw soybeans, but the Kunitz soybean will change that.
   ``This is a vehicle through which we can deliver protein without
processing,'' said Robert Easter, a university animal nutrition
specialist who supervised the Kunitz feeding trials.
   ``This ... gives farmers another alternative,'' he said. ``They
can feed it directly to their livestock, they can sell it in the
marketplace, or they can process it to get full use of the oil.''

   OPEC officials on Thursday predicted
demand for the cartel's oil would average 21.5 million barrels a
day next year, well under its current production level.
   Subroto, secretary-general of the 13-nation Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, released the forecast after a brief
meeting of a special monitoring panel.
   Ministers attending the session agreed to huddle privately on
Friday before opening OPEC's full winter conference on Saturday
morning.
   The ministers will try to come up with a new production and
pricing arrangement that will halt output cheating and keep crude
prices firm in the months ahead.
   With higher output in Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi
Arabia, the cartel produced nearly 23.5 million barrels of crude a
day last month, according to analysts' estimates.
   That is considerably higher than the current, fourth-quarter
ceiling of 20.5 million barrels a day.
   Despite the surge, prices have held fairly strong. But if the
cartel were to pump more oil than required by consuming nations,
prices could plummet.
   Subroto said the average price of a basket of crudes monitored
by OPEC was $17.16 a barrel from January through the third week of
October when it reached $17.76.
   OPEC's target price is $18 a barrel. Just a year ago, the OPEC
basket registered $12.34.
   Futures prices for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S.
crude, have been running about $20 a barrel. Middle Eastern
varieties have been a few dollars less.
   Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have been cheating openly,
pumping as much as double their individual quotas of about a
million barrels a day, according to analysts.
   The overproduction is intended to underline their demands for
bigger shares of OPEC's total output.
   Saudi Arabia, OPEC's biggest producer and the world's largest
crude exporter, recently joined in the overproduction, a move seen
by analysts as a negotiating ploy before the talks.
   At a September meeting, Iran offered a proposal to cover the
demands of Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates. The plan received
considerable attention but failed to gain quick approval by all
nations.
   Subroto said the proposal ``certainly is still there, but I
presume there will be other proposals as well.''
   Iran's Gholamreza Aqazadeh refused to respond when asked if the
plan were still alive.
   But Indonesian Oil Minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita said, ``It's
history ... because things have changed.''
   In his economic report, Subroto said OPEC expected an increase
in world economic growth of 3 percent next year, a bit under the
3.3 percent pace of 1989.
   Total demand for oil _ excluding such centrally planned
economies as the Soviet Union _ was estimated at 51.8 million
barrels a day in 1990, up from 50.9 million barrels this year.
   Sources speaking on condition of anonymity said earlier that
Kuwait offered slightly more conservative projections. It estimated
world demand at 51.5 million barrels a day next year and the call
on OPEC oil at 21 million barrels.
   Subroto said Kuwait had gone along with the majority view.
   The ministers, even usually talkative ones, said little upon
arrival in Vienna, insisting they needed to talk first to their
colleagues.
   The United Arab Emirates' Mana Saeed Otaiba, apparently
defending his his country's output, said, ``We tackled our quota
ourselves in accord with the interests of our people and our
commitment toward OPEC.''
   Once the ministers set a new production ceiling, they will have
to divvy up the total among all nations.
   Iran's September plan called for lifting the overall supply
ceiling to 21.5 million barrels a day to meet the demands of Kuwait
and the United Arab Emirates for larger shares of the total. Gabon
and Ecuador would also get more.
   Algeria, Indonesia, Nigeria and Venezuela would see their shares
shrink as would Iran and Iraq. Saudi Arabia, Libya and Qatar would
remain unchanged.
   Saudi Arabia's minister, Hisham Nazer, has said his country will
not cut its one-quarter share of total output.
   But one oil official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
other countries would like the oil giant to kick in some, too.
   ``It would give credibility to the whole exercise if all are
seen as having contributed to resolution of the problem,'' he said.

   Some of the biggest stores are in trouble. The
economic expansion is looking creaky. And social mores are calling
for less, not more conspicuous consumption.
   Other than that, it's your typical post-Thanksgiving shopping
season.
   Faced with some unusual challenges and predictions of a
lackluster season, the nation's retailers are trying to add some
sparkle to give Americans extra incentive to do their annual duty.
   As the traditional shopping season opens, consumers are likely
to see more sales help behind store counters, special services and
markdowns.
   The retail industry's hopes are modest. Sales will grow just
slightly more than inflation, rising by 5.5 percent after 1988's
unexpectedly robust 9 percent gain, according to the National
Retail Merchants Association.
   Price reductions may be a must for retailers facing a
make-or-break season, which accounts for almost half of their
annual business. In highly competitive markets, retailers who don't
jump on the price-cutting bandwagon will be left watching their
customers go elsewhere.
   Many companies face a cash crunch, like Campeau Corp., which is
struggling to restructure its debts after buying up Allied and
Federated department stores. The decision by struggling L.J. Hooker
Corp. to liquidate six of its seven B. Altman &amp; Co. stores
threatens to incite a regional price war in the Northeast.
   ``It's a tough environment. It's very competitive. The only
things that seem to make people want to spend money are sales or
special events,'' said Rosalind Wells, chief economist of the
National Retail Merchants Association. ``That's the way that stores
are generating business _ by being promotional.''
   The situation will warm Christmas shoppers' hearts. ``They
should get good buys,'' Ms. Wells noted.
   More heartwarming news for consumers is that an abundance of
quality, name-brand merchandise is being sold at lower prices this
year. The country's biggest retailer Sears, Roebuck and Co. soon
will launch an advertising blitz reminding shoppers of its
``everyday low pricing'' policy.
   Off-price merchants in some parts of the country may boast an
unusually broad selection. This is because manufacturers nervous
about getting paid by troubled chains are choosing to take what
they can get from bargain outlets.
   Analyst Walter Loeb of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. said he expects
consumers to be choosey and shop around. ``I think this is going to
be a season of value-oriented buying,'' he said.
   Not all retailers are filled with Yuletide gloom. The outlook
varies by region. Stores in the Northeast may be heading for a
cheerless season but merchants in faster growing Southwest states
may have cause for celebration.
   Many major store owners don't intend to reach for their markdown
pens at the first sign of sluggish sales. Dilliard Department
Stores Inc., with outlets in the Midwest and South, has told
analysts it won't succumb to unscheduled discounting.
   Heavy markdowns are bad news for retailers. When stores charge
less for merchandise, they generally make less money.
   Retailers have a recurring nightmare that seasonal shoppers will
shy away from stores for fear of having to meet big bills later on.
It almost never comes to pass; people get sentimental around the
holidays and tend to over-spend.
   But this year an element of the bad dream already is happening.
Consumers have held back on buying expensive goods for months, some
of them because they've had it with heavy debts.
   The most important reason for the slowdown in spending on costly
durable goods is that the country has reached the penny-pinching
period of the economic cycle. Demands have been met. Consumers
already own VCRs, CD players, refrigerators and other long-lasting
appliances.
   On top of this, people who track consumer behavior say luxury
and excessive spending have been going out of fashion.
   Professional shopper Suzy Gershman said it's the end for ``the
shop-'til-you drop years'' and nowadays people are picking more
practical gifts.
   ``I think the gift for this year and the future ... has just the
right blend of humor, practicality and extravagance,'' said
Gershman, an author and consultant to American Express Co.
   Her idea of an ideal Christmas present? A disposable camera that
can be had for under $10.
   Some retailers have geared up by offering special services such
as personal shoppers to ease customers through the ordeal of
selecting gifts.
   By making buying as comfortable and efficient as possible,
retailers hope to win customers that otherwise might have stayed
home and thumbed through catalogs. Mail-order houses have
aggressive campaigns to wow store-weary shoppers and some are
promising guaranteed delivery by Christmas Eve.
   More salespeople are being deployed in some stores. The strategy
could backfire if customers are turned off by the hard-sell of
poorly trained employees overly eager for commissions.
   ``Some chains don't need more tired, crabby sales staff fighting
over customers,'' Touche Ross &amp; Co. retail specialist Cynthia Turk
said.
   Looking for previously untapped revenue sources, most of the
large retailers are developing programs aimed at corporate gift
givers, Ms. Turk said. Companies looking to buy multiple presents
for staff and clients represent a lucrative market niche for
retailers.
   The calendar may give sales an extra kick this year. With
Christmas on a Monday, retailers have a final weekend to serve
last-minute shoppers.
